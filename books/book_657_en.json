Blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, who was addressed by the Almighty's saying: {And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl: 44]. So he (peace and blessings be upon him) fulfilled this duty in the truest sense, and the prayer was among the greatest of what he clarified to the people by word and deed, to the extent that he once prayed on the pulpit—standing, bowing on it—and then said to them: (I have done this only so that you may follow me and learn my prayer) (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). He made it obligatory for us to follow him in it, saying: (Pray as you have seen me pray) (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And he gave glad tidings to the one who prays it like his prayer that he has a covenant with Allah to enter Paradise, saying: (Sahih Abi Dawud) (Five prayers which Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has obligated; whoever performs their ablution well, prays them at their times, and perfects their bowing, prostration, and humility, has a covenant with Allah that He will forgive him. And whoever does not do so, has no covenant with Allah; if He wills, He forgives him, and if He wills, He punishes him).",

To proceed: When I finished reading the 'Book of Prayer' from 'At-Targhib wat-Tarhib' by Al-Hafiz Al-Mundhiri (may Allah have mercy on him) and teaching it to some of our Salafi brothers—this was four years ago—it became clear to us all the high status and position prayer holds in Islam, and the reward, virtue, and honor for the one who establishes it and performs it well. It also became clear that this varies—increasing and decreasing—in proportion to its closeness to or distance from the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), as he indicated in his saying (Sahih Abi Dawud): (Verily, a servant performs the prayer, yet nothing is written for him of it except a tenth, a ninth, an eighth, a seventh, a sixth, a fifth, a quarter, a third, or half of it). Therefore, I alerted the brothers that we cannot perform it perfectly—or close to it—unless we know the description of the Prophet's prayer (peace and blessings be upon him) in detail, including its: obligations, etiquettes, forms, supplications, and remembrances, and then strive to apply that practically. Only then can we hope that our prayer will restrain us from immorality and wrongdoing, and that the reward and recompense mentioned regarding it will be written for us.",

This is to make it easy for those who read it—among those who truly love the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)—to fulfill his command in the aforementioned hadith: (Pray as you have seen me pray). For this reason, I rolled up my sleeves and tracked down the hadiths related to my objective from various books of Hadith. The result was this book which is in your hands. I stipulated upon myself not to include in it any Prophetic hadiths except those with an established chain of narration according to the rules and principles of the noble Science of Hadith. I disregarded everything isolated by an unknown or weak narrator, whether regarding forms, remembrances, virtues, or otherwise, because I believe that the authentic hadiths offer sufficiency over the weak ones. For the weak [hadith] conveys nothing—without dispute—except conjecture, and mere conjecture, as the Almighty said: {It does not avail against the truth at all}. And the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: (Beware of suspicion/conjecture, for suspicion is the falsest of speech) (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Thus, Allah Almighty did not assign us to worship Him by acting upon it; rather, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) forbade us from it, saying:",

I was keen to preserve the text of the hadith and the wording as it appeared in the books of Sunnah. Since a hadith may have multiple wordings, I would choose one for the benefit of the compilation or otherwise, and I might add other wordings to it, indicating that by saying: (And in a wording: such and such) or (And in a narration: such and such). I rarely attributed them to their narrators among the Companions, nor did I specify who narrated them from the Imams of Hadith, to facilitate reading and reviewing. As for the other section (Bottom), it acts as a commentary on the former.

    "text": "The answer is from two angles: First: The hadith is not authentic; rather, it is false and has no basis. The scholar As-Subki said: (I have not found a chain for it, neither authentic, weak, nor fabricated). I say: It was narrated with the wording: (...The difference of my companions for you is a mercy) and (My companions are like stars; whichever of them you follow, you will be guided), and both are not authentic. The first is very weak, and the other is fabricated. I have verified the discussion on all of this in (Silsilat Al-Ahadith Ad-Da'ifah wal-Mawdu'ah) (Numbers 58, 59, and 61). Second: The hadith, along with its weakness, contradicts the Holy Quran, for the verses revealed regarding it—prohibiting division in religion and commanding agreement in it—are too famous to mention. However, there is no harm in citing some as examples. The Almighty said: {And do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart} [Al-Anfal: 46]. And He said: {And do not be like the polytheists, [those] who divided their religion and became sects, every faction rejoicing in what it has} [Ar-Rum: 31-32]. And He said: {But they will not cease to differ, except whom your Lord has given mercy} [Hud: 118-119]. If those whom your Lord has mercy on do not differ, and only the people of falsehood differ, then how can it be conceived that difference is a mercy?",

It has appeared to us during this period that it has had a good effect among the believing youth in guiding them to the obligation of returning in their religion and worship to the pure source of Islam: the Book and the Sunnah. Those acting upon the Sunnah and worshipping by it have increased among them—praise be to Allah—until they have become known for that. However, I sensed from some of them a hesitation to rush into acting upon it, not out of doubt regarding the obligation of doing so after citing the verses and reports from the Imams commanding the return to it, but due to doubts they hear from some imitating Sheikhs. Therefore, I decided to address and refute these doubts, hoping that those few might then be compelled to act upon the Sunnah along with those who already do, thereby becoming among the Saved Sect by the permission of Allah Almighty. 1 - Some of them said: There is no doubt that returning to the guidance of our Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in the affairs of our religion is an obligation, especially in matters of pure worship where there is no room for opinion and Ijtihad because they are divinely ordained (Tawqifi), like prayer for example. But we hardly hear any of the imitating Sheikhs commanding this. Rather, we find them approving of the difference [of opinion] and claiming it is a mercy/expansion for the Ummah, arguing with a hadith—which they often repeat on such occasions to refute the supporters of the Sunnah—: (The difference of my Ummah is mercy). So it seems to us that this hadith contradicts the methodology you call to and upon which you authored this book and others. What is your saying regarding this hadith?",

Is there a difference between their differing and the differing of others among the later generations? The answer: Yes, there is a big difference between the two types of differing, which appears in two things: First: Its cause. Second: Its effect. As for the difference of the Companions, it was out of necessity and a natural difference in understanding, not by choice seeking disagreement. Added to that are other matters that existed in their time necessitating their difference which disappeared after them (2). Such difference cannot be completely avoided, and its people are not subject to the blame mentioned in the previous verses and what carries their meaning, due to the absence of the condition for culpability, which is intent or persistence in it. As for the difference existing among the imitators, they often have no excuse for it. For some of them, the proof from the Book and Sunnah may become clear, supporting the other Madhhab which they do not customarily follow, yet they leave it for no reason other than it being contrary to their Madhhab.

Both groups may argue for remaining in disagreement using that false hadith: (The difference of my Ummah is mercy). We have often heard them using it as evidence. Some justify this hadith saying: Difference is mercy because it provides expansion/leeway for the Ummah. Although this justification contradicts the explicit verses mentioned earlier and the purport of the Imams' previous words, a text has come from some of them refuting it. Ibn Al-Qasim said: (I heard Malik and Al-Layth saying regarding the difference of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him): 'It is not as people say: \"There is expansion in it\"; it is not so.

Ubayy spoke truth and Ibn Mas'ud did not fall short. But I will not hear anyone differing in it after this position of mine except that I will do such and such to him') (1). Imam Al-Muzani also said: (It is said to the one who allows difference and claims that if two scholars strive (perform Ijtihad) in an incident, and one says 'Halal' and the other 'Haram', that each is correct in his Ijtihad: Is this based on a text (Asl) or analogy (Qiyas)?

This is what no rational person allows, let alone a scholar') (2).

I say: The best explanation I found in the narrations is what Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir mentioned in (Sharh Ikhtisar Ulum Al-Hadith) (p. 31), which is that the Imam said: (People have collected and seen things we have not seen). This is from his complete knowledge and fairness, as Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said. Thus, it is proven that difference is entirely evil and not a mercy. However, some of it is blameworthy, like the difference of those fanatical for Madhhabs, and some is not blameworthy, like the difference of the Companions and those Imams who followed them—may Allah gather us in their group and grant us success to follow them. So it appears that the difference of the Companions is other than the difference of the imitators. Its summary: The Companions differed out of necessity, but they used to disapprove of difference and flee from it whenever they found a way. As for the imitators—despite the possibility for them to be free from it, even in a large section of them—they do not agree nor strive for it; rather, they approve of it. So what a difference between the two differences. That is the difference in terms of cause. As for the difference in terms of effect, it is clearer. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them)—despite their known difference in branches—maintained the appearance of unity most strictly and were far removed from anything that would split the word or crack the ranks. Among them, for example, were those who saw the legislation of reciting Basmalah aloud and those who did not; those who saw the recommendation of raising hands and those who did not; those who saw ablution broken by touching a woman and those who did not. Yet, they used to pray together behind one Imam, and none of them disdained praying behind the Imam due to a difference in Madhhab. As for the imitators, their difference is completely the opposite...",

    "text": "For its effects were that Muslims divided in the greatest pillar after the two testimonies, which is the prayer. They refuse to pray together behind one Imam under the pretext that the Imam's prayer is invalid or at least disliked according to the one who differs from his Madhhab. We have heard this and seen it, as others have (1). How could it be otherwise when the books of some famous Madhhabs have stated dislike or invalidity? The result of this was finding four niches (Mihrabs) in the Grand Mosque where four Imams pray successively, and you find people waiting for their Imam while another Imam stands praying. Indeed, the difference reached what is more severe than that among some imitators, such as forbidding marriage between a Hanafi and a Shafi'i. Then a fatwa was issued by one of the famous Hanafis—nicknamed (Mufti of the Two Weights/Humans and Jinn)—permitting a Hanafi man to marry a Shafi'i woman, justifying it by saying: (treating her with the status of the People of the Book) (1). The implication—and implications of books are considered by them—is that the reverse is not permitted, i.e., a Shafi'i man marrying a Hanafi woman, just as a man from the People of the Book cannot marry a Muslim woman.

Therefore, they are safe from being included in the verses prohibiting division in religion—unlike the later generations—may Allah guide us all to His straight path. Would that their aforementioned disagreement was confined to harm among themselves and did not extend to others among the nation of invitation (non-Muslims). Then the matter would have been somewhat lighter. But—alas—it exceeded them to others among the disbelievers in many lands and regions, blocking them from entering Allah's religion in crowds due to their disagreement. In the book (Darkness from the West) by the virtuous professor Muhammad Al-Ghazali (p. 200), it states: (It happened in the conference held at Princeton University in America that one of the speakers raised a question—often raised in circles of Orientalists and those accusing regarding Islamic aspects—saying: 'With which teachings do Muslims advance to the world to define the Islam they invite to? Is it the teachings of Islam as understood by Sunnis? Or the teachings understood by Shiites, Imamis, or Zaydis? Moreover, each of these groups differs among themselves. One group may think about an issue with limited progressive thinking, while others think with old, rigid thinking. The summary is that those inviting to Islam leave those invited to it in confusion because they themselves are in confusion').",

And is it required for one who is honored with the religion of Islam to follow one of the four Madhhabs? That is: to be Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, or otherwise? Or is it not required? Because a great difference and grave dispute occurred here when several enlightened individuals from the men of Japan wanted to enter the religion of Islam and be honored with the honor of faith. They presented this to the Association of Muslims in Tokyo. A group from the people of India said: They should choose the Madhhab of Imam Abu Hanifa because he is the lamp of the Ummah.

I say: This claim is furthest from the truth; rather, it is clearly false as evident from the previous words. All of them indicate the contrary. All we call for is to stop taking Madhhabs as a religion and setting them up in place of the Book and Sunnah, such that reference is made to them during disputes or when wishing to derive rulings for new incidents, as the pseudo-jurists of this time do. Based on this, they established new laws for personal status, marriage, divorce, etc., without referring to the Book and Sunnah to know the right from the wrong and the truth from falsehood. Rather, they follow the method of (their difference is mercy) and seeking licenses and ease or interest—so they claimed. How well spoke Sulaiman At-Taymi (may Allah have mercy on him): (If you took the license of every scholar, all evil would gather in you). Narrated by Ibn Abd al-Barr (2/91-92) and Uqbah said: (This is a consensus; I know of no disagreement in it). So this is what we deny, and it is in accordance with consensus as you see. As for referring to their sayings, benefiting from them, and using them to understand the truth in what they differed upon regarding matters not explicitly in the Book and Sunnah or matters needing clarification, this is something we do not deny; rather, we command it and encourage it, for the benefit from it is hoped for whoever walks the path of guidance by the Book and Sunnah.",

And know that whoever cares for preserving the Sunan and rulings stated in the Quran and looks into the sayings of the jurists (Fuqaha)—making them an aid to his Ijtihad, a key to the ways of reasoning, and an interpretation for the Sunan that hold multiple meanings—and does not imitate any of them the way Sunan which must be obeyed in all cases are imitated without reflection, and does not relieve himself of what the scholars tasked themselves with regarding preserving Sunan and pondering them, and follows their example in research, understanding, and reasoning, and thanks them for their effort in what they provided and alerted to, and praises them for their correctness which constitutes most of their sayings, yet does not absolve them of error just as they did not absolve themselves of it—this person is the student holding to what the Righteous Salaf were upon. He is the one hitting his mark, seeing his guidance, and following the Sunnah of his Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the guidance of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). But whoever exempts himself from reasoning and ignores what we mentioned, opposing the Sunan with his opinion and desiring to return them to the extent of his own view, he is misguided and misguiding. And whoever is ignorant of all that and rushes into fatwa without knowledge is even more blind and more astray). This is the truth in which there is no obscurity, so leave the side roads. 4 - Then there is a common illusion among some imitators that prevents them from following the Sunnah when it becomes clear that the Madhhabs contradict it. This is their thought that following the Sunnah implies stating the error of the Madhhab's founder, and stating error means, to them, attacking the Imam. Since attacking an individual Muslim is not permissible, how then regarding an Imam among their Imams? The Answer: This meaning is false, and its cause is turning away from understanding the Sunnah. Otherwise, how could a rational Muslim say such a meaning when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) is the one who said:",

This hadith refutes that meaning and clarifies with unambiguous clarity that saying 'So-and-so erred' means in the Shari'ah: 'So-and-so is rewarded one reward'. If he is rewarded in the view of the one correcting him, how can correcting him be imagined as an attack on him? There is no doubt that this illusion is false and anyone holding it must retract it; otherwise, he is the one attacking Muslims, and not just ordinary individuals, but their great Imams among the Companions, Tabi'in, and the Mujtahid Imams and others after them. For we know with certainty that these distinguished ones used to correct each other and refute each other (1). Would a rational person say: Some of them were attacking others? Indeed, it is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) corrected Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) in his interpretation of a dream a man saw. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: (You were correct in some and erred in some) Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Did he (peace and blessings be upon him) attack Abu Bakr with this statement? Strange is the effect of this illusion on those who hold it; it blocks them from following the Sunnah that contradicts their Madhhab because following it means to them attacking the Imam, while following him—even in contradiction to the Sunnah—means respecting and revering him. Therefore, they persist in imitating him to flee from the imagined attack. These people have forgotten—and I do not say pretended to forget—that due to this illusion, they have fallen into something worse than what they fled from.

If opposing the Imam is considered an attack on him by you, then opposing the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) is more obviously an attack on him; indeed, that is disbelief itself—and refuge is sought with Allah—if someone said that to them, they would have no answer except one word we have often heard from some of them: 'We only left the Sunnah out of trust in the Imam of the Madhhab, and that he is more knowledgeable about the Sunnah than us.' Our answer to this statement is from several angles which would take too long to discuss in this introduction. Therefore, I will limit myself to one of them, which is a decisive answer by Allah's permission. I say: It is not only the Imam of your Madhhab who is more knowledgeable than you about the Sunnah; rather, there are tens—nay hundreds—of Imams who are also more knowledgeable than you about the Sunnah. So if the authentic Sunnah comes contrary to your Madhhab—and one of those Imams had taken it—then taking it, in this case, is imperative for you because your aforementioned statement is invalid here. For your opponent will say to you in opposition: 'We only took this Sunnah out of trust in the Imam who took it, so following him is more worthy than following the Imam who contradicted it.' This is clear and not hidden from anyone, God willing. Therefore, I can say: Since this book of ours has collected the authentic Sunan from him (peace and blessings be upon him) regarding the description of his prayer, there is no excuse for anyone to leave acting upon them because it contains nothing that the scholars agreed to leave—far be it from them—rather, there is no issue mentioned in it except that a group of them held it.

And (Mu'adh used to pray Isha [the last one] with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then return and pray with his companions. He returned one night and prayed with them, and a young man from his people [from Banu Salimah named Sulaym] prayed. When it became too long for the youth, [he turned away and] prayed [in a corner of the mosque], then went out, took the rein of his camel, and left. When Mu'adh finished, that was mentioned to him, so he said: Indeed, he has hypocrisy in him; I will surely inform the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) of what he did. And the youth said: And I will surely inform the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) of what he did. So they went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the morning, and Mu'adh informed him of what the youth did. The youth said: O Messenger of Allah, he stays long with you then returns and prolongs it for us. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: (Are you a source of trial, O Mu'adh?) And he said to the youth: (What do you do, O nephew, when you pray?). He said: I read the Opening of the Book, and I ask Allah for Paradise and seek refuge in Him from the Fire, and I do not know your humming nor the humming of Mu'adh. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: (It is around these two that I and Mu'adh hum [revolve]). He said: The youth said: But Mu'adh will know when the people arrive and have been informed that the enemy has come. He said: So they arrived and the youth was martyred. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Mu'adh after that: (What did my adversary and your adversary do?). He said: O Messenger of Allah, Allah was truthful and I lied; he was martyred).",

When he finished his prayer, Khabbab said to him: O Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, you prayed a prayer tonight the like of which I have not seen you pray. He said: (Yes, it was a prayer of hope and fear. [And] I asked my Lord, Mighty and Majestic, for three qualities; He gave me two and withheld one from me. I asked my Lord that He not destroy us with what He destroyed the nations before us (and in a wording: that He not destroy my Ummah with a famine), and He granted me that. And I asked my Lord, Mighty and Majestic, that He not enable an enemy from other than us to overcome us, and He granted me that. And I asked my Lord not to make us into conflicting factions, but He withheld that from me) (An-Nasa'i and Ibn Khuzaymah, and Al-Hakim classified it as Sahih and Al-Dhahabi agreed). And (he stood for a night with a verse repeating it until morning, and it is: 'If You should punish them - indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise' (5:118) [with it he bowed, with it he prostrated, and with it he supplicated]. [When it was morning, Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: 'O Messenger of Allah, you kept reading this verse until morning, bowing with it, prostrating with it] [and supplicating with it], [while Allah has taught you the whole Quran]. [If one of us did this, we would have found fault with him]. [He said: (Indeed I asked my Lord, Mighty and Majestic, for intercession for my Ummah, and He granted it to me. And it shall be attained, if Allah wills, by whoever does not associate anything with Allah)]).",

And in some of them came: 'Ibrahim' himself, because he is the origin in the prayer and charity, and the rest of his family only receive that subsequently. And in some of them, this and that were mentioned to draw attention to both). If you know that, then the question has become famous among scholars regarding the aspect of similarity in his saying: (As You sent blessings...) etc., because the established rule is that the one likened is less than the one likened to, but the reality here is the opposite, since Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is better than Ibrahim, and the implication of him being better is that the requested blessings be better than every blessing that has occurred or will occur. Scholars have answered this with many answers you can see in 'Al-Fath' and 'Al-Jala', reaching about ten views, some weaker than others, except one view which is strong and was deemed good by Sheikh Al-Islam and Ibn Al-Qayyim. It is the view of the one who said: (The family of Ibrahim includes Prophets who have no equal in the family of Muhammad. So if the like of what Ibrahim and his family have - which includes Prophets - is requested for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his family, the family of Muhammad receive from that what befits them, for they do not reach the ranks of Prophets, and the surplus which belongs to the Prophets - including Ibrahim - remains for Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he obtains a distinctiveness that no one else obtains). Ibn Al-Qayyim said: (This is better than all that preceded. And better than it is to say: Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is from the family of Ibrahim; rather, he is the best of the family of Ibrahim, as narrated by Ali bin Talhah from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) regarding His saying, the Exalted: {Indeed, Allah chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of Imran over the worlds} [Ali Imran: 33]. Ibn Abbas said: (Muhammad is from the family of Ibrahim). This is a text. If other Prophets who are descendants of Ibrahim are included in...",

So our saying: 'As You sent blessings upon the family of Ibrahim' covers the blessings upon him and upon all the Prophets from the descendants of Ibrahim. Then Allah the Exalted commanded us to send blessings upon him and upon his family specifically, to the extent that we sent blessings upon him along with the rest of the family of Ibrahim generally - and he is among them. His family receives from that what befits them, and all the rest remains for him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: There is no doubt that the specific blessings for the family of Ibrahim, with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) among them, are more perfect than the blessings obtained for them without them. So for him is requested from the blessings this great matter which is better than what Ibrahim has definitively. Thus, the benefit of the simile and its running according to its principle becomes apparent, and that what is requested for him of blessings by this wording is greater than what is requested for him by other than it. For if the request by supplication is only for the like of the one likened to, and he has the most abundant share of it, he obtains from the requested likeness more than what Ibrahim and others have. Added to that is what he has from the one likened to of the share that no one else obtained. Thus, by this appears his virtue and honor over Ibrahim and over everyone in his family - including the Prophets - which is befitting of him. And this prayer becomes indicative of this preference and subordinate to it, and it is among its causes and implications. So may Allah send blessings upon him and upon his family and grant them much peace, and reward him on our behalf with the best He has rewarded a Prophet on behalf of his nation. O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad as You sent blessings upon the family of Ibrahim, Indeed You are Praiseworthy and Glorious. And bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed the family of Ibrahim, Indeed You are Praiseworthy and Glorious). Second Benefit: The noble reader sees that all these formulas, despite their varying types, contain blessings upon the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his wives, and his offspring along with him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Therefore, it is not from the Sunnah, nor is one fulfilling the Prophetic command, if one restricts oneself to saying: 'Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad' only. Rather, one must bring one of these formulas completely as they came from him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There is no difference in that between the first Tashahhud and the last.

And the meaning of my saying 'Tashahhud' is the Tashahhud and the prayer [blessings] upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); one of them does not suffice without the other). As for the hadith: (He used not to increase in the two Rak'ahs [first sitting] more than the Tashahhud), it is a rejected (Munkar) hadith as I verified in (Al-Da'ifah) (5186). Indeed, among the wonders of this time and its scientific chaos is that some people dare - namely Professor Muhammad Is'af Al-Nashashibi in his book: (True Islam) - to deny the prayer upon the Family in the prayer upon him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), despite that being reported in the (Two Sahihs) and others from a group of Companions, including Ka'b bin Ujrah, Abu Hamid Al-Sa'idi, Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari, Abu Hurairah, and Talhah bin Ubaidullah. In their hadiths, they asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): (How do we send blessings upon you?) So he taught them these formulas. His argument for denial is that Allah the Exalted did not mention anyone else with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in His saying: {Send blessings upon him and greet him with peace}. Then he denied and exaggerated in denial that the Companions asked him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that question, because the meaning of 'Salah' (prayer/blessings) was known to them, which is supplication, so how could they ask him? This is an exposed fallacy, because their question was not about the meaning of sending blessings upon him so that what he mentioned would apply, but rather it was about the *method* (how-to) of sending blessings upon him as came in all narrations as previously indicated. Thus, there is no strangeness, for they asked him about a legislative method that they could not know except through the Wise and All-Knowing Lawgiver. This is just as if they asked him about the method of the obligatory Prayer based on His saying: {And establish the Prayer}. For their knowledge of the original meaning of 'Salah' in the language does not dispense with their need to ask about its legislative method. This is clear and not hidden.",

    "text": "As for his indicated argument, it is worthless. Because it is known among Muslims that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the clarifier of the Speech of the Lord of the Worlds, as He, the Exalted, said: {And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [Al-Nahl: 44]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) clarified the method of sending blessings upon him, and in it is the mention of the Family, so accepting that from him is obligatory due to His saying, the Exalted: {And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from} [Al-Hashr: 7], and his saying (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the famous Sahih hadith: (Verily I have been given the Quran and the like of it with it). It is referenced in (Takhreej Al-Mishkat) (163 and 4247). I wonder what Al-Nashashibi - and whoever might be deceived by his flashy words - says about one who might deny the Tashahhud in prayer or deny the menstruating woman leaving prayer and fasting during her menses, claiming that Allah did not mention Tashahhud in the Quran but only mentioned standing, bowing, and prostrating, and that He did not drop prayer and fasting from the menstruating woman in the Quran, so she must perform them? Do they agree with this denier in his denial or do they rebuke him? If it is the first - and that is what we do not hope for - then they have strayed far and left the consensus of Muslims. And if it is the latter, then they have been guided and correct. Whatever they reply to that denier is our reply to Al-Nashashibi. We have shown you the face of that. So beware, O Muslim, of trying to understand the Quran independently of the Sunnah, for you will never be able to do that, even if you were the Sibawayh (master grammarian) of your time. Here is the example before you; for this Al-Nashashibi was among the senior scholars of language in the present century, yet you see he went astray when he was deceived by his knowledge of language and did not seek help in understanding the Quran from the Sunnah; rather, he denied it as you knew.

Therefore, later scholars differed regarding the legitimacy of adding it in the Ibrahimic Prayers. The space does not allow detailing the discussion on that now. Those who held the view of not legitimizing it mentioned following the perfect instruction of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to his nation when he was asked about the method of sending blessings upon him, so he answered commanding with his saying: (Say: Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad...). However, I want to convey to the noble readers here the opinion of Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani on that, considering him one of the senior Shafi'i scholars who combined Hadith and Fiqh. For contrary to this noble Prophetic instruction has become widespread among the later Shafi'is. Al-Hafiz Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Muhammad Al-Ghurabili (790 - 835) - who was a close student of Ibn Hajar - said (may Allah have mercy on him), and from his handwriting I copied: (And (i.e., Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar) - may Allah allow us to benefit from his life - was asked about the description of the blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the prayer or outside the prayer, whether it is said to be obligatory or recommended: Is it a condition in it to describe him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with Siyadah (Mastery), such as saying for example: 'Allahumma salli 'ala Sayyidina Muhammad' or 'ala Sayyid al-Khalq' or 'ala Sayyid Walad Adam', or should one restrict oneself to saying: 'Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad'? And which is better: bringing the word of Siyadah because it is a fixed attribute for him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or not bringing it due to the absence of that in the narrations?

It is as if he derived that from the Sahih hadith which contains: (Glory be to Allah by the number of His creation). For it is established that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Mother of the Believers - seeing she had done much Tasbeeh and prolonged it -: (I have said after you words that if they were weighed against what you said, they would outweigh them). So he mentioned that. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to like comprehensive supplications. Judge Iyad devoted a chapter to the description of the blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the book (Al-Shifa) and cited therein traces raised (Marfu') from a group of Companions and Successors; in none of them from any of the Companions or others is the word: (Sayyidina). Among them is the hadith of Ali that he used to teach them the method of blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), saying: 'O Allah, Spreader of the Expanses and Creator of the Heavens, place Your foremost blessings and growing favors and increasing greetings upon Muhammad, Your servant and Messenger, the Opener of what was closed.' And from Ali that he used to say: 'The blessings of Allah, the Kind and Merciful, and the Angels brought near, and the Prophets, the Truthful, the Martyrs, and the Righteous, and whatever has glorified You, O Lord of the Worlds, be upon Muhammad bin Abdullah, the Seal of the Prophets and Imam of the God-fearing...' The Hadith. And from Abdullah bin Masud that he used to say: 'O Allah, place Your blessings...",

And from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he used to say: 'Whoever wants to drink from the fullest cup from the Basin of the Chosen One, let him say: O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon his family, his companions, his wives, his children, his offspring, his household, his in-laws, his helpers, his followers, and his lovers.' This is what I prefer from (Al-Shifa) regarding the form of blessings upon him from the Companions and those after them. He mentioned other than that in it. Yes, it was reported in the hadith of Ibn Masud that he used to say in his blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 'O Allah, place the virtues of Your blessings, Your mercy, and Your favors upon the Master of the Messengers (Sayyid Al-Mursalin)...' The Hadith. Ibn Majah narrated it, but its chain is weak. And the hadith of Ali referred to first was narrated by Al-Tabarani with a chain that is not bad, and it contains strange words which I narrated explained in the book (The Virtue of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) by Abu Al-Hasan bin Al-Faris. The Shafi'is mentioned that if a man swore an oath to send the best blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the way to fulfill the oath is to send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [saying]: 'Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad kullama dhakarahu adh-dhakiroon wa saha 'an dhikrihi al-ghafiloon'. And Al-Nawawi said: The correct view which should be asserted is to say: 'Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad wa 'ala aali Muhammad kama sallayta 'ala Ibrahim...' The Hadith. A group of later scholars critiqued this, saying there is nothing in the two mentioned methods indicating established superiority in them in terms of transmission. As for meaning, the superiority is apparent in the first. The issue is famous in the books of Fiqh. The purpose of it is that everyone who mentioned this issue among the jurists entirely, the word: (Sayyidina) did not occur in the speech of any of them. If...",

I say: What Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) held regarding the lack of legitimacy of addressing him as Sayyid (Master) in the prayer upon him, in adherence to the noble Command - which is the position of the Hanafis - is what should be held onto, because it is the truthful proof of loving him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). {Say, 'If you should love Allah, then follow me, [so] Allah will love you'} [Ali Imran: 31]. For that reason, Imam Al-Nawawi said in (Al-Rawdah) (1 / 265): (And the most perfect blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is: Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad...) etc., according to the third type mentioned previously, and he did not mention (Al-Siyadah) in it. Fourth Benefit: Know that the first type of the formulas for blessings upon him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) - as well as the fourth type - is what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught his Companions when they asked him about the method of sending blessings upon him. This has been used as evidence that it is the best of methods for sending blessings upon him, because he would not choose for them - nor for himself - except the most noble and best. Hence, Al-Nawawi considered it correct in (Al-Rawdah) that if one swore to send the best blessings upon him, he would not fulfill the oath except with that method. Al-Subki justified this by saying that whoever uses it has sent blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with certainty, and whoever uses a wording other than it, his performance of the requested blessings is in doubt, because they said: 'How do we send blessings upon you?' He said: (Say:...), so he made the blessings upon him from them to be their saying such-and-such. Ended. Al-Haytami mentioned it in (Al-Durr Al-Mandud) (Folio 25/2). Then they mentioned (Folio 27/1) that the objective is achieved by any of these methods that came in the authentic Hadiths.",

    "text": "Fifth Benefit: Know that it is not legislated to fabricate one formula of blessings from the combination of these formulas. The same is said regarding the formulas of Tashahhud mentioned previously. Rather, that is an innovation in the religion. The Sunnah is to say this one sometimes and that one sometimes, as clarified by Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah in a research of his regarding Takbeer in the two Eids (Majmu') (69 / 253 / 1). Sixth Benefit: The scholar Siddiq Hasan Khan said in his book (Nuzul Al-Abrar bil-'Ilm Al-Ma'thur min Al-Ad'iyah wal-Adhkar) after citing many hadiths regarding the virtue of sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and doing so frequently - he said (p. 161): (There is no doubt that the Muslims who send the most blessings upon him are the People of Hadith (Ahl al-Hadith) and the narrators of the pure Sunnah. For among their duties in this noble science is sending blessings upon him before every hadith, and their tongues remain moist with his mention (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There is no book among the books of Sunnah nor a collection among the collections of Hadith - with their varying types like (Jawami'), (Masanid), (Ma'ajim), (Ajza'), and others - except that it contains thousands of hadiths. Even the most concise of them in volume, the book (Al-Jami' Al-Saghir) by Al-Suyuti, contains ten thousand hadiths. Measure against that the rest of the Prophetic scrolls. So this Saved Group and Hadith Community are the closest of people to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the Day of Resurrection and the most fortunate with his intercession (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) - may my father and mother be sacrificed for him. No one among the people equals them in this virtue except one who brings better than what they brought, and below that is the stripping of thorns [an impossible task]. So upon you, O seeker of good and seeker of salvation without harm, is to be a Muhaddith (Hadith scholar) or attached to the Muhaddithin, otherwise do not be... for there is no benefit returning to you in other than that). I say: And I ask Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, to make me among these Muhaddithin who are the closest of people to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Perhaps this book is among the evidences for that.",

And (they used to point with their hands when they said Tasleem to the right and to the left, so the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw them and said: (What is the matter with you, pointing with your hands as if they were the tails of restive horses? When one of you says Tasleem, let him turn to his companion and not gesture with his hand). [So when they prayed with him again, they did not do that]. (And in a narration: It suffices one of you to place his hand on his thigh then say Tasleem to his brother on his right and his left). The Obligation of Tasleem (Al-Hakim and Al-Dhahabi authenticated it). And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: (...And its permission [conclusion that allows other actions] is the Tasleem).",

    "text": "Conclusion: All that has preceded regarding the description of his prayer (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) applies equally to men and women. There is nothing in the Sunnah that necessitates exempting women from some of that. Rather, the generality of his saying (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): (Pray as you have seen me pray) includes them. This is the saying of Ibrahim Al-Nakha'i, who said: (The woman does in the prayer just as the man does). Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated it (1 / 75 / 2) with a Sahih chain from him. As for the hadith about the woman gathering herself together in prostration and that she is not like the man in that, it is Mursal (disconnected) and not a proof. Abu Dawood narrated it in (Al-Marasil) (117 / 87) from Yazid bin Abi Habib, and it is referenced in (Al-Da'ifah) (2652). As for what Imam Ahmed narrated in (Masail of his son Abdullah from him) (p. 71) from Ibn Umar that he used to command his women to sit cross-legged in prayer, its chain is not authentic because it contains Abdullah bin Al-Umari who is weak. And Bukhari narrated in (Al-Tarikh Al-Saghir) (p. 95) with a Sahih chain from Umm Al-Darda: (That she used to sit in her prayer the sitting of a man, and she was a jurist). This is the last of what was easy to collect regarding the description of the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from Takbeer to Tasleem. I ask Allah the Exalted to make it purely for His Noble Face and a guide to the Sunnah of His Prophet, the Compassionate, the Merciful.",
