    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n**Introduction to the Book**\n\nThe Imam, the Scholar, the Role Model, the Unique, the Hafiz, Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim al-Ash'ari al-Qurtubi al-Hanafi, may Allah have mercy on him, said:\n\nPraise be to Allah, who favored us with sciences and arts, and made the lineage of the Arabs the noblest of lineages. Blessings and peace be upon the Chosen One, from the core of the core, transferred from the honor of the loins, and upon his family and companions, the best of companions, and upon his pure wives, the close ones, and upon those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Return.\n\nTo proceed, I have read books on Arab genealogy, so I mentioned [this] for those who aspire to noble status and seek superiority in their community through the mention of lineages. I mention for him primary sources that succeed if sought. I have gathered for him from the origins of tribes and the branches of the ancestors that which reaches the middle of the lineage and ensures safety from error.\n\nIn summary: It is not fitting for anyone with understanding and intellect, or noble lineage [to ignore this], due to what it contains of maintaining family ties and knowing rulings. Among the examples is the command of the Prophet (peace be upon him). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Learn enough about your lineages to maintain ties with your kin, for maintaining ties of kinship increases wealth and extends life [delays the term].\" He (peace be upon him) also said: \"Whoever claims lineage to other than his father or seeks other than his patrons, Allah will not accept from him any obligatory or voluntary act.\" It is narrated from him (peace be upon him) that he said: \"The Arabs are favored for three reasons: because I am an Arab, the Qur'an is Arabic, and the speech of Allah is Arabic.\"\n\nIt is narrated from Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: \"Learn your lineages to maintain your kinship ties, and do not be like the Nabateans of the Sawad; when one of them is asked, 'Where are you from?' he says, 'From such-and-such village.' By Allah, there may be something between a man and his brother, but if he knew what was between him and them, it would deter him from violating it.\" It is narrated from Abdullah bin Umar that he said to his father: \"Preserve your own lineage and the mothers of your son.\"\n\nAllah the Almighty, the most truthful of speakers, said, and His word is prioritized at all times: {O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.} [Al-Hujurat: 13].\n\nThe exegetes said: 'Sha'ub' (Peoples) are the origins from which 'Qaba'il' (Tribes) dispersed. Then the Arabs dispersed from the Tribes, then the Tribes dispersed from the Peoples, then the Peoples dispersed from the 'Ama'ir' (Clans), then the Clans dispersed from the Tribes, then the 'Butun' (Bellies/Sub-tribes) dispersed from the Clans, then the 'Afkhadh' (Thighs/Branches) dispersed from the Bellies, then the 'Fasa'il' (Families/Sections) dispersed from the Thighs. There is nothing below the Fasilah. So they are: Sha'ub (Peoples), Qaba'il (Tribes), 'Ama'ir (Clans), Butun (Bellies), Afkhadh (Thighs), and Fasa'il (Families).\n\nAn example of this is that Banu Abd al-Muttalib is the 'Fasilah' of the Prophet (peace be upon him), Banu Hashim is his 'Fakhdh', Banu Abd Manaf is his 'Batn', Quraysh is his 'Imarah', Kinanah is his 'Qabilah', and Mudar is his 'Sha'b'.\n\nIt is narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that he said: \"Verily Allah chose the Arabs, then chose Mudar from the Arabs, then chose Al-Nadr bin Kinanah from them, then chose Quraysh from them, then chose Banu Hashim from them, then chose me from Banu Hashim.\"\n\nNeither the Chosen Prophet nor the righteous Companions were ignorant of this measure. It is narrated from him (peace be upon him) that he said: \"Aslam, Ghifar, Muzaynah, and some of Juhaynah are better in the sight of Allah on the Day of Resurrection than Ghatafan, Hawazin, Asad, Tamim, and the two sons of Amir bin Sa'sa'ah.\" This indicates his (peace be upon him) knowledge of lineages in reports that would take long to mention. Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) was the most knowledgeable of people about lineages, and likewise Jubayr bin Mut'im was among the narrators of lineages.\n\nWe will now mention a part of what we promised. It has been the custom of genealogists to begin the lineage of the people of the Levant with the lineage of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), then with the tribes of Mudar, then with the lineage of Quraysh because they were honored by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Then with the tribes of Rabi'ah because they are the brother-branch of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Among the people of Yemen, [they begin] with the Ansar because they were honored by supporting the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), then with the tribes of Azd because they are the origin of the Ansar, then with the tribes of Kahlan because they are a branch of Azd, then the tribes of Himyar.\n\nOur beginning in this summary is with:\n\n**The Lineage of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)**\n\nThe first of the lineages is the lineage of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).",

    "text": "He is Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Abd al-Muttalib bin Hashim bin Abd Manaf. Manaf was the greatest of their idols, and Abd Manaf was named after it; his [real] name was Al-Mughira. Bin Qusayy, who is Mujammi', and his name is Zaid. Bin Kilab bin Murrah bin Ka'b bin Lu'ay bin Ghalib bin Fihr bin Malik bin Al-Nadr bin Kinanah bin Khuzaymah bin Mudrikah bin Ilyas bin Mudar bin Nizar bin Ma'ad bin Adnan bin Add bin Alyasa' bin Al-Hamisa' bin Salaman bin Haml bin Qedar bin Isma'il (Ishmael) bin Ibrahim (Abraham), peace be upon him, bin Azar - who is Terah - bin Nahor bin Sarug bin Reu bin Peleg bin Eber bin Shelah bin Arpachshad bin Shem bin Noah, peace be upon him, bin Lamech bin Methuselah bin Enoch - who is Idris the Prophet, peace be upon him - bin Jared bin Mahalalel bin Kenan bin Enos bin Seth - who is Hiba-Allah - bin Adam the Chosen, the Father of Mankind, peace be upon him and upon all the prophets.\n\nThis is the lineage of the Prophet (peace be upon him). There have been differences regarding the names of the men above Adnan; some added, some decreased, some advanced, and some delayed names. Allah knows best what is correct. It is narrated from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: \"We did not find anyone who knew what is beyond Adnan, nor what is beyond Qahtan, except by conjecture.\"\n\nIt is narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that when the lineage reached Ma'ad bin Adnan, he said: \"The genealogists have lied,\" and he recited the verse: {And many generations between them.} [Al-Furqan: 38]. This withholding is nothing [significant in preventing knowledge of major tribes], for they have preserved the mothers of tribes and the peoples of the ancients, though they differed on some and some were hidden from them. Know that genealogy is knowledge that does not [necessarily] benefit [in the Hereafter] and ignorance that does not harm. Perhaps some narrated this report from the Prophet (peace be upon him), but it is not proven according to most scholars, nor did they adhere to it in what we have mentioned in this book.\n\n**The Children of the Prophet**\nThen we return to mentioning the lineages. He said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) had eight children: four men and four women. As for the men: Al-Qasim, Al-Tahir (who is Abdullah), Al-Tayyib, and Ibrahim (whose mother is Mariya the Copt). The women are Fatima, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum, and Zainab. Their mother is Khadijah bint Khuwaylid bin Asad bin Abd al-Uzza bin Qusayy bin Kilab. (The first to meet the Prophet's lineage [from his ancestors] is Banu Abd al-Muttalib, and he was nicknamed Shaybah al-Hamd).\n\nThe uncles of the Prophet (peace be upon him) are Al-Harith (the eldest), Al-Abbas, Hamzah, Abu Talib, Dirar, Al-Muqawwim, Mus'ab (who is Jahll, 'Wa'a' al-Khamrah'), Al-Zubayr, Abu Lahab (whose name is Abd al-Uzza), and Al-Ghaydaq (it is said Al-Ghaydaq is Jahll). These are ten, the sons of Abd al-Muttalib.\n\n**The Children of His Uncles**\nThe children of Al-Abbas are Abdullah, Ubaidullah, Al-Fadl, Qutham, Abd al-Rahman, Tamam, Kathir, and Al-Harith.\nThe children of Abdullah are Al-Abbas bin Muhammad al-Kamil bin Ali al-Alim, Abbas, Abdullah, Al-Fadl, and Abd al-Rahman; their mother is Zur'ah bint Mashrah al-Kindiyyah.\nThe Caliphs are from the descendants of Muhammad bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Al-Abbas. In our time today, they are: Al-Rashid bin Al-Mustarshid bin Al-Mustazhir bin Al-Muqtadi. Among them is Muhammad bin Al-Muqtafi bin Al-Mustazhir. Al-Muqtadi is Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Al-Qa'im bi-Amrillah, who is Abdullah bin Al-Qadir Billah, who is Ahmad bin Ishaq bin Al-Muqtadir bin Ahmad Al-Mu'tadid bin Talha bin Al-Muwaffaq bin Al-Mu'tazz Billah bin Ja'far Al-Mutawakkil bin Muhammad Al-Mu'tasim Billah bin Harun Al-Rashid bin Muhammad Al-Mahdi bin Abdullah Al-Mansur bin Muhammad Al-Kamil bin Ali Al-Alim bin Abdullah bin Al-Abbas.\n\nFrom the children of Ali bin Abdullah are: Muhammad, Salih, Abdullah, Abd al-Rahman, Isma'il, Al-Namir, Layth, Isa, Dawud, and Abd al-Samad.\nFrom the children of Muhammad bin Ali are: Abu Ali Abu al-Abbas, Abdullah Al-Mansur, Musa, Muhammad, Ibrahim, and Al-Abbas.\nFrom the children of Al-Mansur are: Ja'far, Sulayman, Ali, Isa, Ya'qub, Al-Qasim, Salih, and Muhammad Al-Mahdi (the Caliph).\nFrom the children of Al-Mahdi are: Musa Al-Hadi, Ibrahim bin Shakla, Mansur, Ishaq, and Harun Al-Rashid.\nFrom the children of Harun Al-Rashid are: Muhammad Al-Amin, Abdullah Al-Ma'mun, his brother Al-Qasim Al-Mu'taman, Abu Ya'qub, Abu al-Abbas, Abu Abdullah, and Qutr bin Al-Mu'tasim.\nFrom the children of Al-Mu'tasim are: Harun Al-Wathiq, Ahmad Al-Musta'in, and Ja'far Al-Mutawakkil.\nFrom the children of Harun Al-Wathiq is Muhammad Al-Mahdi.\nFrom the children of Ja'far Al-Mutawakkil are: Ahmad Al-Mu'tamid, Al-Zubayr Al-Mu'tazz, Al-Muntasir, Talha Al-Muwaffaq, and Ibrahim - Al-Mu'ayyad Billah.",

It is said they were named that because they were attributed to their mother called Al-Ghaytalah.\n\n(Section)\nAs for Lu'ay bin Ghalib...",

The children of Al-Harith are called Banu Jusham; their nurse was a slave of Lu'ay called Jusham, so they were attributed to him.\nAs for Samah bin Lu'ay, he fell into Oman and died there, and there is a story about him. All names of Arabs are Usamah with Hamza on the Sin [sic, likely meant Alif/Hamza at start], except Samah bin Lu'ay. Al-Sam refers to veins of gold, singular Samah.\nAs for Amir bin Lu'ay, his children are Husayl and Uwayd. As for the children of Hisl (who is Al-A'lam): Suhayl bin Amr bin Abd Shams bin Abd Wudd bin Nasr bin Malik bin Hisl bin Amir bin Lu'ay. Among them is Amr bin Abd Wudd, whom Ali, may Allah honor his face, killed in a duel on the Day of the Trench, and his age was close to one hundred and forty years. Among them is the wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him), Sawdah bint Zam'ah bin Qais bin Abd Shams bin Abd Wudd. Among them is Abu Sabrah (and Sabrah is the prominent necklace) bin Abi Ruhm bin Abd al-Uzza bin Abi Qais bin Abd Wudd. Among them is Ibn Umm Maktum, the Mu'adhin of the Prophet (peace be upon him); Umm Maktum is his mother, and he is Abdullah bin Qais bin Malik bin Al-Asam bin Rawahah.\nAs for Sa'd bin Lu'ay, Abu Bananah: From his clan is Thabit Al-Bunani, and his children were attributed to her [Bunanah], who is his wife. Among them is Luqnan bin Juhayr bin Zaid bin Muqis bin Hisl bin Amir bin Lu'ay.\n\n(Section)\nAmong them is Sa'd bin Abi Sarh bin Harith bin Habib bin Khuzaymah bin Nasr bin Malik bin Hisl bin Amir bin Lu'ay.\nGhalib begot Amr, Qais, and Taym (who is Al-Adram).

And Amir bin Abdullah bin Makhzumah bin Abi Qais bin Urwah bin Hafs bin Malik bin Amr bin Ghalib.\nAs for Khuzaymah bin Lu'ay, from them are A'idh and Ma'ash the poet; Kathir Al-A'idhi is from them.\n\n(Section)\nFihr begot Al-Harith and Muharib. From the descendants of Al-Harith is Abu Ubaidah, who is Amir bin Abdullah bin Al-Jarrah bin Hilal bin Uhayb bin Dabbah bin Al-Harith bin Fihr bin Malik.\nMuharib bin Fihr begot Khalid the Elder bin Wahb bin Tha'labah bin Wa'ilah bin Amr bin Shayban bin Muharib bin Fihr. Among them is Dirar bin Al-Khattab bin Mirdas bin Kathir bin Amr bin Habib bin Amr bin Shayban bin Fihr bin Malik bin Al-Nadr. And he is Qurashi.\nThese are the clans of Quraysh: They are Banu Hashim, Banu Al-Muttalib, Banu Nawfal, Banu Umayyah, Banu Abd Shams, Banu Abd al-Dar, Banu Asad, Banu Shaybah, Banu Husays, Banu Amir bin Lu'ay, Banu Jusham, and Banu Al-Adram bin Ghalib (who are Muharib and Al-Harith, sons of Fihr bin Malik).\nHe said: There is no Hashimi on earth except from the descendants of Abd al-Muttalib, nor Husayni except from the descendants of Ali bin Al-Husayn.\nHe said: Quraysh is divided into two parts: Quraysh al-Bitah (of the valley) and Quraysh al-Zawahir (of the outskirts).\nQuraysh al-Bitah are Banu Abd Manaf (who are Banu Hashim, Banu Al-Muttalib, Banu Nawfal, Banu Umayyah, Banu Abd Shams), Banu Qusayy bin Abd al-Dar, Abd al-Uzza bin Qusayy, Banu Zuhrah bin Kilab, Banu Taym bin Murrah, Banu Makhzum bin Yaqazah bin Murrah, Banu Ka'b, the children of Adi, and the children of Jumah and Sahm sons of Amr bin Husays bin Ka'b bin Lu'ay. These are Quraysh al-Bitah.\nAs for Quraysh al-Zawahir, they are Banu Fihr bin Muharib and Al-Harith sons of Fihr, Banu Al-Adram bin Ghalib bin Fihr, and Samah bin Amr bin Lu'ay.\nAs for Al-Hums, they are Quraysh, Kinanah, and those who followed their religion from Banu Amir bin Sa'sa'ah. It is said that Khuza'ah is also from Al-Hums. In Jahiliyyah, they used to be strict (yatahammasun) in their religion, meaning strictness and zeal (Hamasah). They would not go out to the plains during the days of Mina nor enter houses through their doors [during Hajj].\nThis is the lineage of Quraysh, who are the children of Al-Nadr bin Kinanah. It is said that Quraysh is the son of Fihr bin Malik, and it is said he is a gatherer because no Qurashi is found attributed to a father above Fihr. It is said the gatherer of all Quraysh is Fihr and Al-Harith sons of Malik bin Al-Nadr, and whoever traces lineage to Al-Nadr is not Qurashi because Al-Nadr begot Malik and Yakhlud. The first saying is the correct one.\n\n(Section) Lineage of Kinanah in Khuzaymah",

    "text": "He said: Khuzaymah begot four: Kinanah, Asad, Asadah, and Al-Hun. The descendants of Asadah entered into Banu Asad.\nKinanah begot Abd Manat, Malik, Malkan, Amir, Ghanam, Makhzumah, Jadwal, Ghazwan, Jadal, Al-Nadr (who is Quraysh, and we have mentioned him), Nasr, Amr, Al-Harith, Sa'd, and Awf.\nAbd Manat begot Bakr, Sa'd, Amir (who is Al-Adram), and Al-Harith. Ali bin Mas'ud bin Mazin bin Zi'b bin Adi bin Amr bin Mazin Al-Ghassani succeeded upon their mother after their father Abd Manat. She bore him Makhzumah, Awf, and Sa'idah. He nursed the sons of Abd Manat along with his own sons, so they were all attributed to him. Thus, Banu Abd Manat were called Banu Ali. Some people mistakenly said Abd Manat's name was Ali.\nBakr bin Abd Manat begot Layth, Damrah, and Al-Du'il (with Damma on Dal and Kasra on Hamza). If you attribute to it, you open the Hamza and say 'Du'ali', just as you say 'Namari' in attribution to Namir. And Al-Harith and Adi.\nFrom the descendants of Layth bin Bakr is Al-Tu'il Amir bin Wa'ilah bin Abdullah bin Hams bin Judi bin Sa'd bin Layth. Among them is Al-Shaddakh Wathilah bin Al-Asqa' Abd al-Uzza bin Nufayl bin Nashib bin Ghirah bin Sa'd bin Layth; he accompanied the Prophet (peace be upon him) and narrated from him. Among them is Al-Shaddakh (with Damma on Shin and Fatha on Dal) bin Awf bin Ka'b bin Amir bin Layth. He was named Al-Shaddakh because he crushed (Shaddakha) the blood [money/feud] between Khuza'ah and Quraysh, saying: \"I have crushed their blood under my foot,\" and he paid the blood money to his people excluding Khuza'ah.\nFrom Banu Damrah is Amr bin Umayyah Al-Damri bin Qisan bin Talha bin Hudi bin Damrah. Among them is Abu Dharr, who is Jundub bin Junadah bin Sufyan bin Ubayd bin Abdullah bin Ghifar bin Alil bin Malik bin Damrah bin Bakr bin Abd Manat bin Kinanah. In the Hadith from him (peace be upon him) he said: \"Ghifar, may Allah forgive it; and Aslam, may Allah keep it safe.\"\nFrom Banu Al-Du'il is Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali, who is Uthman bin Amr bin Sufyan bin Jandal bin Ya'mar bin Hulays bin Thafathah bin Adi bin Al-Du'il.\nFrom the descendants of Sa'd bin Abd Manat is Qasim bin Ubayd bin Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Al-Ramah bin Sa'd bin Abd Manat.\nFrom the descendants of Murrah [likely meant Amrah or similar from context] bin Abd Manat is Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum bin Muhriz bin Al-A'war bin Ja'dah bin 'Adh bin 'Itwarah bin Amr bin Mudlij bin Murrah bin Abd Manat. Among them is Alqamah bin Muhriz, who was a tracker (Qa'if). Banu Mudlij are the trackers.\nFrom Abd Manat are Habib and Al-Harith, sons of Taym bin Zaid bin Murrah bin Abd Manat. Among them is Qais bin Amir bin Abd Manat. Among them are Banu Khuzaymah bin Amir bin Murrah bin [text unclear, possibly Lamjad Mashah] bin Kinanah.\n\n(Section)\nFrom the children of [text missing, likely Kinanah] are Al-Harith, Adi, Tha'labah, Haddad, Sa'd, Sa'idah, and Khashashah.\nFrom the descendants of Al-Harith is Al-Husayn bin Amir bin Abdullah bin Al-Muqsim bin Muhammad bin Maymun bin Ubayd bin Raziq bin Amir. And Haml bin Shaqq bin Raqabah bin Makhdaj bin Amir bin Tha'labah bin Al-Harith bin Malik. Among them are the two Qa'ims: Hudhayfah bin Adi bin Fuqaym bin Adi bin Alqamah bin Tha'labah bin Al-Harith bin Malik. Banu Fuqaym are the Nasi'ah (postponers of sacred months). Among them is Al-Qalammas bin Fuqaym, who used to make war lawful one month and postpone it another month. Among them is Rabi'ah bin Amir bin Hadman bin Khalid bin Alqamah bin Firas bin Malik bin Kinanah.\nFrom the descendants of Adi bin Malik is Mashhar bin Qamhur bin Hunayf bin Lajrif bin Hararah bin Awf bin Amtah bin Qala' bin Iyad bin Hudhayfah Al-Ba'as bin Adi bin Malik.\n\n(Section)\nFrom the descendants of Malkan (with Kasra on Mim or Fatha with Sukun on Lam) bin Kinanah are Tha'labah, Sa'd, Ghanam, Haram, Awf, Malik, and Majdaj. Among them is Al-Qalammas bin Amir bin Ka'b bin Amir bin Majdaj bin Malkan bin Kinanah.\nThese are the clans of Kinanah: Banu Al-Layth, Banu Damrah, Banu Ghifar, Banu Fuqaym, Banu Mudlij, Banu Firas, and Banu Ubar.\nAs for the Ahabish, they are those who allied (tahabbashu) together. They are Banu Al-Harith bin Abd Manat bin Kinanah, Banu Nufathah, Banu Al-Haya from Khuza'ah, and Al-Qarah from Banu Al-Hun bin Khuzaymah. The one who contracted the alliance of Al-Qarah is Taym bin Amir bin Awf bin Al-Harith bin Abd Manat bin Kinanah. The one who contracted the alliance of the rest is the brother of Malik bin Amir bin Awf bin Al-Harith bin Abd Manat bin Kinanah.\n\n**Lineage of Asad bin Khuzaymah**",

The name of Al-Sayda' is Amr, and he had children: Nukrah, Khuzaymah, Nawfal, and Muqashshar.\nAmong them is Tulayhah bin Khuwaylid bin Nawfal bin Nadlah bin Al-Ashyad bin Hijran to the end of the lineage. He was considered a knight. He is the one who claimed prophethood, was captured on the Day of Apostasy, and returned to Islam.\nAmong them is Bishr bin Abi Khazim, who is Amr bin Awf bin Humayri bin Mashirah bin Usamah bin Walibah bin Al-Harith bin Tha'labah bin Dudan bin Asad.\nAmong them is Abd Bani Al-Has'has, Suhaym bin Hudandi Saqa bin Ghifar bin Ka'b bin Tha'labah bin Asad bin Dudan bin Asad.\n\n(Section)\nFrom the descendants of Sa'd bin Tha'labah is Ubayd bin Al-Abras bin Jusham bin Amir bin Amr bin Malik bin Al-Harith bin Sa'd bin Tha'labah.\nAmong them is Al-Kumayt bin Zaid Al-Akhnas bin Zaid bin Mukhalid bin Rabi'ah bin Qais bin Al-Harith bin Wahb bin Amir bin Amr bin Malik bin Sa'd bin Tha'labah.\nFrom Banu Malik bin Tha'labah is Nathib bin Salamah bin Malik bin Tha'labah. And Ghadirah and Amr bin Malik bin Tha'labah bin Dudan bin Asad.\n\n(Section)\nFrom Banu Dudan is the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), Abs bin Ya'mar bin Sabrah bin Murrah bin Kabir bin Ghanam bin Dudan. His mother is Zainab bint Jahsh, the wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him). He had brothers: Abu Ahmad and Abdullah. They all migrated to Abyssinia. Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan was the wife of Ubaydullah bin Jahsh; he converted to Christianity in Abyssinia and died there as a Christian, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) married Umm Habibah after him.\nFrom Banu Ghadirah is Ibn Husayn bin Hurayth bin Aws bin Bilal bin Sa'd bin Jamal bin Nasr bin Ghadirah bin Malik bin Tha'labah bin Dudan bin Asad.\nAmong them is Ukashah bin Mihsan bin Harthan bin Qais bin Murrah bin Ka'b bin Ghanam bin Dudan bin Asad.\n\n(Section)\nFrom the descendants of Amr bin Asad are Al-Musayyib, Al-Namir, Al-Qulayb, Al-Musallih, Hashim, and Al-Halik. Al-Halik was the first to work iron, and because of him, the Arabs used to taunt Banu Asad and Banu Amr specifically, calling them 'Al-Quyun' (The Smiths). It is said iron is 'Haliki', attributed to Al-Halik bin Amr bin Asad.\n\n(Section)\nFrom Banu Kahil bin Asad is Al-Hadidi bin Man bin Kahil, and 'Ilba' bin Al-Harith bin Harithah bin Hilal bin Kahil.\nFrom Banu Sa'b bin Asad is Abdullah bin Sa'b bin Asad.\nThese are the clans of Banu Asad. Among them are Kahil, Faq'as, Al-Sayda', Qu'ayn, Walibah, Nashib, and Ghadirah, and we have mentioned their lineages.\n\n**Lineage of Al-Hun bin Khuzaymah**\nHe said: Khuzaymah begot three: Kinanah, Asad (we have mentioned them), and Al-Hawn (with Fatha on Ha, and it is said Al-Hun with Damma, but the first is more correct) bin Al-Ma'um bin Khuzaymah.\nHe begot Malih and Al-Hakam. Malih begot Yashay', and they entered into Madhhij and attributed themselves to them. Al-Hakam bin Al-Hun attributed himself to Sa'd al-Ashirah bin Madhhij, so they said Al-Hakam bin Sa'd. They are the clan of the Emir Al-Jarrah bin Abdullah Al-Hakami. The poet said:\n\"O Hakam bin Al-Hun, are you not Madhhij?\nWhile you have settled in a flow from Jadhimah, clear and bright.\"\nThe correct view is that Al-Hakam is son of Sa'd bin Madhhij, and Allah knows best.\nBanu Al-Hun are Al-Qarah, and their brothers are Adal (with Damma on Ayn and Fatha on Dad).\nFrom Al-Qarah is Mas'ud bin Amir bin Rabi'ah bin Amr bin Sa'd bin Abd al-Uzza bin Muhallim bin Ghalib bin Abid Yattaba' bin Malih bin Al-Hun bin Khuzaymah.\nAl-Qarah are the descendants of Muhallim bin Ghalib entirely except Adal. It is said that Adal is also Qarah. Al-Qarah was named Qarah because Ya'mar bin Awf Al-Kinani wanted to disperse them among the clans of Kinanah, so a man from them said a verse:\n\"Leave us as Qarah (a settled mass), do not scatter us,\nLest we flee like the fleeing of the ostrich.\"\nSo they were named Al-Qarah for that. Al-Qarah is a small mountain. It is said that Adal and Al-Qarah are sons of Yattaba' bin Al-Hun bin Khuzaymah, and Allah knows best.\n\n**Lineage of Hudhayl bin Mudrikah**",

Add begot Abd Manat, Amr, Khamis, and Murr (who is Abu Tamim bin Murr).\nAbd Manat begot Tamim, Adi, Awf, Ashayb, and Thawr Al-Mahl. Al-Mahl is a mountain to which Thawr was attributed, so it was said Thawr Al-Mahl.\nThe descendants of Abd Manat are called Al-Rabab. Some count Dabbah bin Add among them, and others count Muzaynah bin Add among them. They were called Al-Rabab because they allied against Banu Sa'd bin Zaid bin Tamim and gathered like the gathering of 'Rababah' (a bundle of arrows), or it is said they dipped their hands in 'Rubb' (syrup/thick juice) when they allied.\nAs for Ukl, she was a slave woman who nursed the children of Awf bin Aqyas bin Wa'il bin Awf bin Abd Manat, so they were attributed to her.\nHe said: From Ukl is the poet Al-Namir bin Tawlab bin Zuhayr bin Aqyas bin Ka'b bin Amr bin Awf bin Add bin Al-Harith bin Ukl bin Awf bin Aqyas bin Wa'il bin Awf bin Abd Manat. Ukl is part of Al-Rabab.\nFrom the descendants of Taym bin Abd Manat is Jassas (with light Jim) bin Sabbah bin Rabi' bin Rabi' bin Amr bin Abdullah bin Lu'ay bin Amr bin Al-Harith bin Taym.\nFrom the descendants of Adi bin Abd Manat is Dhu al-Rummah, who is Ghaylan, and his brothers Hisham and Mas'ud, sons of Harithah bin Adi bin Rabi'ah bin Sa'idah bin Ka'b bin Awf bin Tha'labah bin Rabi'ah bin Malkan bin Adi bin Abd Manat.\nFrom the descendants of Thawr bin Abd Manat is the ascetic jurist Al-Rabi' bin Khuthaym.

Basil is the father of the Daylam according to what is said; that is because Basil bin Dabbah went out to the land of Daylam and dressed them like the dress of Arabs and prepared them in the manner of Arabs in raids and seeking revenge.\nHe said: It is said Sa'd had no offspring. All of Dabbah traces back to Sa'd bin Dabbah [sic, text says Sa'd had no offspring then traces back to him, likely a corruption or means Dabbah traces back to someone else or Sa'd bin Dabbah is meant].\nFrom the descendants of Sa'd bin Dabbah is the judge Abdullah bin Shubrumah bin Al-Tufayl bin Hubayrah bin Al-Mundhir bin Hassan bin Dirar.\nAmong them is Zaid Al-Fawaris bin Husayn bin Dirar.\nAmong them is Al-Ghamr bin Amr bin Malik bin Zaid bin Ka'b bin Thuhalah bin Dhuhl bin Malik bin Bakr bin Sa'd bin Dabbah.\nDirar bin Amr had ten children who were called Al-Maradimah because each one of them was like a 'Mirdam' (stone breaker). They are the house of Dabbah.\nDabbah bin Add was on the religion of Sulayman bin Dawud, peace be upon him.

Every 'Sulma' in Arabs is with Fatha on Sin except Al-Aslami Abu Zuhayr, for he found it with Damma.\nFrom the descendants of Uways bin Amr is Al-Qadi bin Ma'unah bin Hurrah bin Iyas bin Hilal bin Thabit bin Ubayd bin Sarah bin Sariyah bin Dahman bin Tha'labah bin Salman bin Uways bin Amr bin Add.\nAmong them is Al-Nu'man bin Ma'di bin Abid bin Sajl bin Hujayr bin Nasr bin Hasanah bin Ka'b bin Abd Thawr to the end of the lineage.",

Rabi'ah, Rizam, Ka'b, and Juhaysh are called Al-Hisan.\nJarir said:\n\"Are Tha'labah the horsemen, or Ziyaha?\nYou equated Tahiyyah and Al-Hisan with them.\"\nIn Banu Tahiyyah is Al-Shaytan bin Zayr bin Zahwan bin Rabi'ah bin Abi al-Aswad bin Malik.\n\nAs for Hanzalah bin Malik, he had eight sons. Five of them are Al-Barajim: Amr, Qais, Ghalib, Zultum (who is Al-Harith), and Kulfah. They were named Al-Barajim because they said: \"We gather like the knuckles (Barajim) of the hand.\" Al-Barajim are what appear when you clench your fist.

Regarding her, Atarid bin Hajib says:\n\"Our prophetess has become a female surrounded by [people]...\nAnd we used to see the prophets of people as males.\"\nHe said: Amr bin Yarbu' is the one who married a ghoul (Si'lah). It was said to him: You will find her the best woman as long as she does not see lightning. So he used to block the gaps of the house. She bore him Asal and Damdam. Then she saw lightning at some time and said: \"Hold your sons, Amr, for I am escaping; lightning over the land of ghouls.\" Then she fled from him and passed. A Rajiz poet says about them:\n\"May Allah fight the sons of the Si'lat,\nAmr bin Yarbu' the worst of people,\nNeither virtuous nor wise.\"\nHe meant 'Sharar al-Nas' (worst of people) and 'Ghayr Akyas' (not wise) but changed Sin to Ta.\n\n(Section)\nAs for Malik bin Zaid bin Manat, his children are Murrah, Tha'labah, Rabi'ah, Mu'awiyah, Qais, Sa'd, and Bakr.

As for Usayyid, it is the diminutive of Aswad in the dialect of Banu Tamim. He is nicknamed Al-Habat and his sons Al-Hubatan. He was nicknamed that because he ate a large amount of gum and his belly swelled (Habita), i.e., bloated.\nFrom Banu Usayyid bin Amr is the poet Aws bin Hajar (moving Ha and Jim) bin Ghiyath bin Abdullah bin Adi bin Namir bin Usayyid bin Amr.\nAmong them is Aktham bin Sayfi bin Rabah bin Al-Harith bin Mahasin bin Mu'awiyah bin Sharif bin Jarwah bin Usayyid bin Amr. He was one of the wise men of the Arabs in Jahiliyyah and lived one hundred and ninety years.

He said: And on the horses blood like Shaqr.\nFrom the descendants of Al-Harith are Ghaylan bin Tamim, Ghaykan, Ghassan, and Al-Jarmaz (who is Al-Harith bin Abdullah).

From the descendants of Kinaniyah bin Harqus is the Kharijite Qatari bin Al-Fuja'ah, nicknamed Abu Na'amah. He rebelled in the time of Abdullah bin Al-Zubayr when he was twenty years old, and was greeted as Caliph. Some people attribute him to Banu Tamim.\nThe derivation of Mazin is from 'Al-Muzn', which is clouds. It is said: So-and-so 'yatamazzan' upon us if he is generous. Al-Mazin is also ant eggs.\nAmong the Arabs, Mazin are [several] clans: This Mazin bin Malik bin Amr bin Tamim, Mazin bin Sa'sa'ah brother of Amir bin Sa'sa'ah, Mazin bin Shayban, Mazin bin Mansur brother of Hawazin and Sulaym, Mazin known in Zubid bin Madhhij, Mazin bin Al-Najjar in Al-Ansar, Mazin bin Fazarah bin Dhubyan, Mazin bin Tha'labah bin Sa'd bin Sa'd bin Dhubyan, and Mazin bin Al-Azd bin Al-Gharth.\nHe said: Sa'd, Amr, and Al-Najim sons of Amr bin Tamim, Al-Harith, Mu'awiyah, and Hubayrah are called Al-Ajmal.

He is Aylan. He was named Aylan because he was poor and used to ask his brother, so he said to him: \"You are but a dependent ('Iyal) upon me,\" so he was named Aylan. It is said Aylan was named after a nurse who nursed Mudar bin Nizar, and his name was Aylan, just as Arabs were attributed to those who nursed them. It is said he was named Aylan [because] there was a man from Bajilah called Qais who had a horse named Kubbah, and they were neighbors and their horses were famous, so it was said: Qais Aylan and Qais Kubbah. Qais Aylan is Qais Mudar, and Qais Kubbah is Qais Mudar bin Al-Gharth bin Bajilah. According to this, he is Qais bin Mudar. The correct and famous view is that he is Qais Aylan, and he is Al-Nas bin Mudar.\nHe said: He begot Khasafah, Sa'd, and Amr. It is said he had a fourth son named Murrah, who left Hijaz seeking camels of his in the western region, fell into the land of the Berbers, married a woman from them, begot children, lived among them until he died, and his progeny spread. It is said that a group of Berbers are from his descendants. Many people have denied this and know only three children for him.\n\n(Section)\nAs for Khasafah...",

He was called Darat al-Qamar (Halo of the Moon) for his beauty, or it is said Darat al-Qamar is Salim's mother. He is the one who said:\n\"I am Ibn Darah, my lineage is known...\nDoes Darah have any shame among people?\nFrom the branches of Qais, and my maternal uncles are Banu Asad...\nFrom the nobility of people, and my fire-stick from them strikes fire.\"\nSalim bin Darah and Thabit bin Rafi' satirized each other. He said:\n\"Woe to you, O Ibn Waqi', who are you?\nYou are the one who appeared when we were hidden.\"\nIbn Qayl got angry for him and struck him with a sword. He was carried to Medina and died there. Al-Kumayt bin Ma'ruf bin Tha'labah bin Rabab bin Al-Asir bin Al-Ahjuwan Al-Asadi said:\n\"Do not increase the gaps in it, for...\nThe sword erased what Ibn Darah gathered.\"\nFrom the descendants of Ashja' is Abu Sinan the Companion, bin Ma'qil bin Sinan bin Mutahhar bin Araki bin Fityan bin Subay' bin Bakr bin Ashja'.\nHe said: From the descendants of Banu Abdullah bin Ghatafan is Uqbah bin Wahb bin Kaldah bin Al-Ja'd bin Hilal bin Al-Harith bin Amr bin Adi bin Jusham bin Awf bin Bahthah bin Abdullah bin Ghatafan.\nAmong them is Al-Hams, who is Amr bin Nasr bin Harithah bin Tarif bin Iman bin Naghis.\nFatimah bint Al-Hurshuf, one of the noble mothers, is the wife of Ziyad Al-Absi.\n\n**Lineage of Abs bin Baghid**\nHe said: Abs begot Qati'ah and Darfah.\nFrom Banu Qati'ah are the perfect ones (Al-Kamalah), Banu Ziyad: Al-Rabi', Umarah, Anas, and Qais, sons of Ziyad bin Sufyan bin Abdullah bin Nashib bin Hadm bin Awd bin Ghalib bin Qati'ah bin Abs. We mentioned their mother, daughter of Al-Hurshub. Banu Ziyad were called: Al-Rabi' the Perfect, Umarah the Giver, Qais the Generous, and Anas the Preserver.\nAl-Rabi' bin Ziyad said to Yazid bin Al-Sa'iq (and Yazid, Zur'ah, Alis, and Amr bin Al-Sa'iq were also brothers from the men of Arabs): Al-Rabi' said: Umarah the Giver is better than Alis, Zur'ah the Subduer is better than Anas, and I am better than you, O saddle of the horse.\nAmong them is Jarir bin Ghalib bin Abis bin Sa'd bin Abdullah bin Nashib.\nAmong them is Urwah to the end of the lineage. Urwah was named Al-Sa'alik (of the brigands) because he used to gather the brigands, who are the poor, feed them, take care of them, and raid with them, taking whatever they could. He is the one who said:\n\"Whoever is like me, possessing dependents and little...\nWealth, throws himself into every peril.\"\nAmong them are Antar and Jundub sons of Amr bin Shaddad bin Mu'awiyah bin Zuhl bin Murad bin Makhzum.

These are gathered by Makhzum bin Adali bin Malik bin Ghalib bin Qati'ah bin Abs.\nBanu Zuhayr are ten.\nAmong them is Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman, who is Husayb bin Jabir bin Rabi'ah bin Jarwah bin Al-Harith bin Qati'ah bin Abs. It is said Al-Yaman is Jarwah bin Al-Harith, so Hudhayfah was attributed to his grandfather with a father in between. Al-Yaman, Hudhayfah's father, had shed blood in Jahiliyyah, so he fled to Medina and allied with Banu Abd al-Ashhal and married among them. His people called him Al-Yaman because of his settling among the people of Yemen [Ansar].\nThe clans of Abs: They are Banu Awf bin Ghalib, Banu Makhzum, and Banu Rawahah.\nThe war of Abs and Dhubyan lasted forty years. It was said to them: Which horses did you find best? They said: The reddish-brown (Kumayt) raised in spring. It was said: Which camels did you find best? They said: The red ones. It was said: Which women did you find best? They said: The daughters of the uncle. It was said: Which slaves did you find best? They said: The mixed-race (Muwalladin).\nHe said: Abs are tribes in the Arabs: Abs Baghid is these, Abs Akk, Abs Hakam, and Abs Hakam al-Rakb.

He was one of their nobles, marrying his daughters to the nobles of Quraysh: Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib, Muhammad bin Talha bin Abdullah, Abdullah bin Al-Zubayr, and Al-Mundhir bin Al-Zubayr.

His mother is Bahilah bint Sa'b bin Sa'd Al-Ashirah. He fathered from another Ma'n. Then he left behind after his father [text unclear, perhaps married] a Muqtitah [wife of father], and she bore him Awd and Hawah. Ma'n had children from another: Sha'ban, Zaid, Wa'il, Al-Harith, Harb, Wahib, Amr, Qutaybah, and Qa'b. Bahilah nursed them all, so they were attributed to her.\nFrom Bahilah is Al-Asma'i, who is Abd al-Malik bin Qurayb bin Abd al-Malik bin Asma' bin Mutahhar bin Rabah (who is Al-Hubab) bin Sa'd bin Abd bin Ghanam [Qutaybah] bin Malik bin Bahilah bin A'sur.\nAmong them is Sahban bin Wa'il bin Ma'bad, the eloquent orator proverbial for his eloquence; it is said \"More eloquent than Sahban bin Wa'il\".\nAmong them is Sahb bin Sa'd bin Abd bin Ghanam bin Qutaybah.\nAmong them is Al-A'sha of Bahilah, who is Amir bin Al-Harith bin Rabah bin Abi Khalid bin Rabi'ah bin Zaid bin Amr bin Salamah bin Tha'labah bin Wa'il bin Ma'n.\nAmong them is Qutaybah bin Muslim bin Amr bin Al-Husayn bin Rabi'ah bin Khalid bin Usayyid bin Al-Khabar bin Ka'b bin Hilal bin Salamah bin Tha'labah bin Wa'il bin Ma'n bin Malik bin A'sur.\nQutaybah bin Muslim had brothers: Salih, Abdullah, Abd al-Rahman, Ziyad, Zurayq, Amr, Yaqidh, Ma'bad, Husayn, and Hammad.

He was named Adwan because he aggressed (Ada) against his brother Fahm and killed him.\nThe mother of Fahm and Adwan is Jadilah bint Murr sister of Tamim bin Murr bin Add. She was the wife of Amr bin Qais, and her children were attributed to her, so it was said: Jadilah Qais.\nAdwan begot Zaid, Yashkur, Malik, Akrashah, and Daws (it is said they are the Daws in Azd).\nFrom Adwan is Amir bin Al-Zarib bin Amr bin Iyad [Yashkur] bin Adwan. He used to judge among the Arabs in Jahiliyyah, and he is the one who ruled regarding the hermaphrodite that he inherits based on where he urinates, and Islam confirmed that.\nAmong them is Abu Sayyarah, whose name is Umaylah bin Al-A'zal bin Khalid bin Sa'd bin Al-Harith bin Aws bin Yazid bin Adwan. He used to lead the people [in Hajj] in Jahiliyyah on a black donkey for forty years. It is said in the proverb: \"Healthier than Abu Sayyarah's donkey.\"\nIn Adwan is Laqb bin Yashkur with Fatha on Lam and movement, and in Azd with Kasra on Lam and Sukun.\n\n(Section)\nAs for Fahm, he begot Sa'd, Qayn, and Abidah.\nFrom the descendants of Sa'd is Ta'abbata Sharran, who is Thabit bin Jabir bin Sufyan bin Adi bin Ka'b bin Harb bin Taym bin Sa'd bin Fahm.\nAmong them is Tha'labah bin Kinanah bin Amr bin Qayn bin Fahm.\n\nThis is the end of the lineage of Qais Aylan, which is the last of the lineage of Mudar bin Ilyas bin Nizar.\nIf Mudar is mentioned, they are Khandaf and Qais, sons of Mudar.\nKhandaf is the wife of Ilyas bin Mudar, and her name is Layla bint Hulwan bin Imran bin Al-Haf bin Quda'ah. She was named Khandaf due to a story: They camped at some stops seeking rainwater pools. A rabbit jumped running among their men, so the camels scattered. Her sons Amr and Amir got up. Amr caught the camels and reached them, so he was named Mudrikah (Overtaker). Amir caught the rabbit and cooked it (Tabakhaha), so he was named Tabikhah. The third son Umair hid under the tent (Inqama'a), so he was named Qama'ah.\nTheir mother went out looking for them when her children were late. Their father met her and said: \"Where are you hurrying (Tukhandifin), O Layla?\" Khandaf and Tabakhtur (strutting/hurrying) are the same. So she was named Khandaf.\nRegarding Layla, their poet says:\n\"We belong to the most mighty and noble Ilyas...\nWe were birthed by Layla who did not commit sin.\"\nHowever, she was known as Khandaf.\nSo the tribes of Mudar are from Khandaf and Qais.\nThe tribes of Khandaf are: Quraysh, Kinanah, Asad, Al-Qarah, Hudhayl, Al-Rabab, Khussah, Muzaynah, and Khamis.\nThe tribes of Qais are: Hawazin, Ghatafan, Sulaym, Fahm, Adwan, Ghani, Bahilah, and Muharib.\nThese are the mothers of the tribes of Mudar, and they branched into peoples and bellies as we have mentioned.

We only prioritized Mudar in the lineage because of their closeness to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).\nHe said: Nizar begot four: Mudar, Rabi'ah, Iyad, and Anmar.\nMudar and Rabi'ah are agreed upon.\nAs for Anmar bin Nizar, the lineage of Anmar bin Arash bin Amr bin Al-Gharth bin Al-Nabit bin Malik bin Zaid bin Kahlan prevailed over his lineage, and Anmar's lineage became Banu Khath'am.\nAnmar is the brother of Rabi'ah through his mother.\nFrom the descendants of Anmar are Al-Gharth and Maslamah.\nSalamah bint Anmar was with Arash bin Amr bin Al-Gharth, and she bore him Anmar Al-Sawad, so his children were from him. The Persians raided them frequently, so they entered into the Romans, became Christians, joined the non-Arabs (Ajam), were cut off from the Arabs, and their lineages became unknown.\nHowever, the lineage of Iyad is more famous than the lineage of Anmar, and from them are known tribes and mentioned men as we will bring forth, Allah Almighty willing.\nHe said: The children of Rabi'ah are Asad, Dubay'ah, Su'dah, Imran, Abis, Kalb, Kilab, Mukalib, Maklabah, Awf, Nahish, Hazbah, 'Afrah, Hanh, Dalaf, Lu'ya, Dib, Dhu'ayb, Amr, Amir, and Mu'adiyah, sons of Rabi'ah bin Nizar.\nAklub entered Khath'am, Awf and Nahish into Madhhij, Banu Mu'adiyah into Kindah, and Kalb and Mazibbah joined Banu Dubay'ah.\nHisham bin Al-Kalbi said: The first house of Rabi'ah bin Nizar in which leadership, judgment, the banner, and the quarter-spoils (Mirba') resided, inheriting that elder from elder, was from Banu Dubay'ah to Anazah bin Asad bin Rabi'ah, and his name was Anazah 'Am. Then leadership shifted to Banu Abd al-Qais bin Afsa (with Sin Muhmalah) bin Du'mi bin Jadilah bin Asad bin Rabi'ah. Al-Dahyan held it among them; his name was Amir bin Sa'd bin Al-Khazraj bin Taym Allah bin Al-Namir bin Qasit. He was named Al-Dahyan because he used to sit for the people in the forenoon (Duha) to judge between them. About him the poet says:\n\"Allah built for Al-Dahyan a house and rank...\nFor in Al-Namir are houses of generosity and sovereignty.\"\nMudar the White was named for his whiteness, and from it is Al-Madirah, which is cooked with oil.\nRabi'ah, which is the helmet of weapons, and he was named Rabi'ah by it.\nHe said: The House and the Number are in Rabi'ah, so Asad bin Rabi'ah begot [children]. We begin with **Lineage of Dubay'ah bin Rabi'ah** for its brevity, then we return to the children of Asad, Allah Almighty willing.\n\n**Lineage of Dubay'ah bin Rabi'ah**\nAbu Ubaydah said: The mightiest house in Rabi'ah when war consumed them was the house of Dubay'ah bin Rabi'ah.\nDubay'ah begot Ahmas, Al-Harith Dhu al-Qiladah, Awf, Yazid, Al-Attaf, and Abbad.\nAmong them is Al-Harith Al-Adjam bin Abdullah bin Duqan bin Ulaybah bin Harith bin Jala bin Aksar bin Dubay'ah. He was named Al-Harith Al-Adjam due to a slant in his mouth from the strength of his affliction. He is the one who ordered Rabi'ah to braid their beards and dye their clothes red - it is narrated dye white - so they would be known among the Arabs. They had a quarter of the spoils (Mirba') over Ma'ad every year, whether staying or raiding. He is the one to whom Dubay'ah said: Whoever wins has the Mirba', so seek it. Whoever insults you, beat him; whoever beats you, kill him; and whoever kills you, you cost him one of two things: either he pays blood money or you overtake him and kill him. Abu Ubayd said: So they transgressed against people and perished.\nAmong them is Al-Musayyib, maternal uncle of Al-A'sha, who is Al-Musayyib bin Alas bin Malik bin Amr bin Thumamah bin Zaid bin Tha'labah bin Adi bin Jusham bin Bilal bin Jama'ah bin Jala bin Ahmas bin Dubay'ah.\nAmong them is Al-Mutalammis, who is Jarir bin Abd al-Masih bin Abdullah bin Zaid bin Duqan bin Ulaybah bin Harith bin Jala bin Ahmas bin Dubay'ah. Al-Mutalammis is the maternal uncle of Tarafa.\nThe attribution to Dubay'ah is Duba'i (with Damma on Dad and Fatha on Ba), to Muzaynah is Muzani, and to Juhaynah is Juhani.\n\n**Lineage of the Children of Asad bin Rabi'ah**\nFrom the descendants of Asad are Jadilah, Anazah (who is Amr, and Anazah entered into Abd al-Qais), Banu Mubashir, Malik, Mansur, and Banu Anazah.\nFrom the descendants of Jadilah are Juran, Khandaf, Adi, and Du'mi.\nFrom the descendants of Yadhkur bin Anazah is one of the two Qariz (gatherers of Qaraz leaves), about whom the poet says:\n\"So hope and wait for my return...\nWhen the Anazi Qariz returns.\"\nAmong them is the second Qariz, who is Abu Nurhum. It is said the second Qariz is from Al-Namir bin Qasit; he went out to gather Qaraz and did not return. Thus they are the two Qarizs, and about them the poet Abu Dhu'ayb Al-Hudhali says:\n\"Until the two Qarizs return, both of them...\nAnd Kulayb is resurrected for Wa'il.\"\nFrom his descendants is Yadhkur bin Anazah bin Sabah bin Atik bin Aslam.\nAmong them is Ubayd bin Ashyam bin Yashkur bin Al-Harith bin Al-Du'il bin Al-Sabah bin Atik bin Aslam.\nFrom Banu Amira bin Asad is Iyas bin Tha'labah bin Harithah bin Fahm bin Yadhkur bin Ulaybah bin Taysir bin Amira bin Asad.\n\n**Lineage of Abd al-Qais bin Du'mi**",

Ubayd bin Al-Harith went out with them. The majority of Shann went to Iraq and found there a people from Iyad and Azd, so they expelled them from it. Iyad went out to Bahrain and its surroundings, and a group from Shann followed them and raided them for days, so sedition occurred between them. It was the days of Al-Juwar. Then Shann was defeated and went out to Abd al-Qais. They expelled Sa'sa'ah bin Sawhan and his brothers, Zaid and Sihan bin Abd al-Qais, and they were spoils.\nIyad went out to Azd and they fought. Abd al-Qais prevailed and moved from Bahrain, and Abd al-Qais settled it.

Duhn are these, not Duhn Bajilah the clan of Ammar Al-Duhni. Among them is the poet 'A'idh bin Mihsan bin Tha'labah bin Wa'ilah bin Ada bin Duhn.\nAbu al-Faraj al-Isfahani said in Kitab al-Aghani: Abd al-Qais bin Afsa bin Jadilah bin Asad.

Suhayb's brother is Malik. He was named Suhayb because his father was a young boy for Khosrau at Al-Ubullah, and their homes were in the land of Mosul. The Romans raided that area and captured Suhayb while he was a small boy. He grew up among the Romans. Kalb bought him, then came with him to Mecca. Abdullah bin Jud'an bought him and sent him to the Prophet (peace be upon him). In the narration from the Prophet (peace be upon him): \"I am the forerunner of the Arabs, Suhayb is the forerunner of the Romans, Salman is the forerunner of the Persians, and Bilal is the forerunner of the Abyssinians.\"\nFrom Al-Namir bin Al-Qarya is Ayyub bin Zaid bin Qais bin Ziyad bin Salamah bin Jusham bin Al-Qarya (his mother), and his father is Malik bin Amr bin Amir bin Zaid bin Manat bin Amir Al-Dahyan.\n\n**Lineage of Bakr bin Wa'il**\nbin Qasit bin Afsa bin Du'mi bin Jadilah bin Asad bin Rabi'ah.\nBakr begot Yashkur and Taghlib [Taghlib is brother of Bakr].\nAmong them is Al-Harith bin Hammam bin Murrah bin Dhuhl bin Shayban bin Tha'labah bin Ukabah bin Sa'b bin Ali bin Bakr bin Wa'il.\nFrom the descendants of Al-Harith bin Hammam are Bistam, Janawah, and Al-Salil, sons of Qais bin Mas'ud bin Qais bin Khalid bin Abdullah bin Dhi al-Jadayn bin Amr bin Al-Harith bin Hammam.\nFrom the descendants of Khalid bin Abdullah is Muwafi Al-Sarqis bin Jabir bin Khalid bin Abdullah bin Dhi al-Jadayn.\nFrom the descendants of Al-Harith are Awf, Murrah, Uyaynah, Khalid, Qais, Jaylah, and Hujr.\n\n(Section)\nFrom the descendants of Hammam bin Murrah",

He had four children: Al-Nu'man and Al-Dahhak (who did not leave offspring), Al-Shahid, and Abdullah. Offspring are posterity and children, and in them are numbers and endurance.\nIbn Hisham said: Akk married into the Ash'aris and stayed among them, so Akk became in the lands of Yemen, so the language became one and the home one.\nHe said: Akk is gathered by two clans: Descendants of Al-Shahid and Descendants of Abdullah.\nAs for Al-Shahid, the numbers of his descendants are in Ghafiq and Sa'idah, sons of Nahshal bin Al-Shahid bin Akk.

Samlaqah was a leader over all Akk, obeyed among them. He is the most capable descendant of Al-Shahid and most exclusive to him.\nWhen Samlaqah died, Banu Abdullah bin Akk, who are Abs and Bulan, said: We must appoint a man from us in place of Samlaqah so that there is a master from the descendants of Abdullah as there was Samlaqah from the descendants of Al-Shahid. No one among them could challenge Samlaqah in leadership during his time.\nWhen he died, Banu Abdullah appointed Abu Shurahbil Al-Naji, who was Samlaqah's nephew (sister's son). Samlaqah's sons, Amr and Taym, got angry and said: We are more entitled to lead after our father. Banu Abdullah disliked it and said: He is your nephew (sister's son) and there is no one after him among us. We have seen fit to put him in his uncle's place, so part of him is for us and part for you, and we are equal in him. He was from you but exclusive, without us, yet we did not deny him leadership over all of us, so how can you dislike Abu Shurahbil while you have in him what we have of relationship?\nHis two sons went out to Bakil and Sari', and their offspring are from Hamdan and Himyar.",

    "text": "(Section)\nFrom the descendants of Al-Ays (Esau) bin Ishaq are the Kings of the Aryans [Persians]: Yazdegerd bin Shahriyar (King) bin Abrad (King) bin Hormizd (King) bin Parvez (King) - who is Khosrau Anushirvan - bin Qawad (King) bin Firuz (King) bin Yazdegerd (King) bin Bahram (King) bin Bahram (King) bin Bahram (King) bin Yazdegerd (King) bin Shapur (King) bin Ardashir bin Sasan (King of Kings) bin Qisdad (King) bin Faris (King) bin Hanius bin Harban bin Malka bin Al-Ays.\nAmong them is Isa (Jesus) bin Maryam (Mary), peace be upon them. Maryam bint Imran bin Mathan bin Sawdin bin Al-Na'rus bin Aba bin Bard bin Nahudis bin Madur bin Athlamiyah bin Ahnanliya bin Kanud bin Yawdan Naqis bin Marsiya bin Asran bin Saz bin 'Awhar, it is said bin Al-Ays.\nAmong them is Ayyub (Job) the Prophet, peace be upon him, bin Afras bin Razah bin Al-Baz bin Da'unak bin Al-Ays.\nThese Persians are from the descendants of Ishaq, peace be upon him. As for the First Persians, they are from the descendants of Ludh bin Sam (Shem), as their lineage will come, Allah Almighty willing. Some people claimed that the Romans are two sects: a sect from the descendants of Japheth and a sect from the descendants of Al-Ays bin Ishaq. Allah knows best the truth.\nThe lineage of the descendants of Ibrahim Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, has ended.\n\n**Lineage of the People of Yemen**\nThey are the descendants of Qahtan bin Amir bin Shamikh bin Arphaxad bin Shem bin Noah, peace be upon him, bin Lamech bin Methuselah bin Enoch - who is Idris, peace be upon him - bin Jared bin Mahalalel bin Kenan bin Enos bin Seth bin Adam the Chosen, blessings of Allah be upon him.\nGenealogists have differed regarding Qahtan. A group said: He is Qahtan bin Aber, who is Hud the Prophet, peace be upon him, bin Shelah. This is a saying that has spread among people, and all the people of Yemen follow it. Poets have articulated it universally and attributed Qahtan to Hud, peace be upon him, in their poems. They said he is Qahtan in Arabic.\nA group said: He is Qahtan bin Hud, peace be upon him, bin Abdullah bin Rabah bin Al-Khulud bin Ad bin Uz bin Iram bin Shem.\nA third group said: He is Qahtan bin Al-Hamisa' bin Yaman - and Yemen was named after him - bin Nabit bin Isma'il bin Ibrahim Al-Khalil, peace be upon them. They said all Arabs are from the descendants of Isma'il, and used as evidence the saying of Allah Almighty: {The religion of your father Ibrahim} [Al-Hajj: 78], and the address in the verse is to the believers because its beginning is {O you who have believed}. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, saying to a group from Aslam and Ansar: \"Shoot, Banu Isma'il, for your father was an archer.\"\nHe said: The correct view among the sayings is that Qahtan bin Aber is not Hud. The two tribes meet at Aber, as Al-Quda'i said: \"To Aber Ma'ad traces back and meets me.\"\nThere is no disagreement that Qahtan and Peleg (Faligh) are brothers. Qahtan is the father of Yemen, and Peleg is the father of Sham. However, the people of Yemen say Qahtan bin Hud bin Aber, and Peleg bin Aber, so that Hud would be father to Yemen specifically. And the people of Sham say Peleg bin Amir, who is Hud, so that he would be their father.\n\n(Section)\nThe wonder from both groups is that they claim Hud as a father, while it is established that Hud is son of Ad, and Ad is from the descendants of Iram bin Shem, while the Arabs are from the descendants of Arphaxad bin Shem. If they were told they are children of Ad, they would deny that. Allah Almighty said, and He is the most truthful of speakers: {And to Ad [We sent] their brother Hud}. Exegetes said: Their brother in lineage.\nWahb bin Munabbih said: Hud is not the father of Yemen, because Yemen is from the descendants of Arphaxad bin Shem, and Hud is from the descendants of Iram bin Shem. Yemen claimed Hud as a father only when Mudar boasted of their father Isma'il, so Yemen claimed Hud as their father. These sayings are as you see, and Allah knows best the truth.\nHe said: The people of Yemen say: We are the 'Aribah (Original) Arabs, and we are older than the descendants of Isma'il and Ibrahim, blessings of Allah be upon them. They were named Yemen because they settled to the right (Yamin) of the sun.\nWe now return to mentioning the lineages. He said: Qahtan begot many children, and we will mention them, Allah Almighty willing. The famous lineage among them is in Al-Muzda'af Awf, who is Ya'rub the King. He is the one who manifested Arabic and it increased on his tongue, so he was named by it. He is the first to be greeted with the greeting of kings: \"Good morning (An'im Sabahan)\" and \"May you refuse cursing (Abayta Al-La'n).\"\nYa'rub begot Yashjub. Yashjub begot Abd Shams, who is Saba the Elder. Saba begot children, and the famous lineage among them is in Himyar and Kahlan. The distinct features for them are famous and known: Himyar are the Kings, and Kahlan are the Protectors.\nWe have seen fit to begin with the tribes of Kahlan, and begin from the tribes of Kahlan with Azd, and begin from Azd with the Ansar, who are Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, because they were honored by supporting the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the honor of Islam comes before the honor of Jahiliyyah.\n\n**Lineage of Al-Azd bin Al-Gharth**\nBin Al-Nabit bin Malik bin Zaid bin Kahlan. It is said Al-Azd and Al-Asad are two dialects with Zay and Sin. Hassan bin Thabit said:\n\"And we are Banu Al-Gharth bin Nabit bin Malik... bin Zaid bin Kahlan, Daws of glories.\"",

    "text": "The name of Al-Azd is Dhara. Al-Azd begot Marib, Nasr, Abdullah, Al-Hibr, Qidar, Al-A'id, Adiqah, and Al-Hun.\nAl-Azd split into twenty-something tribes, and into bellies more than that. It is the root (Jurthumah) of the Ansar, and a great root from the roots of the Arabs. It is narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Al-Azd is the root of the Arabs, so whoever loses his lineage let him come to them.\" We begin from the Ansar with Al-Azd.\n\n**Lineage of the Ansar**\nThey are Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, sons of Harithah Al-Anqa' (named for the length of his neck) bin Amr Muzayqiya bin Amir Ma' al-Sama' bin Harithah Al-Ghitrif bin Imru' al-Qais Al-Bitriq bin Tha'labah Al-Bahlul bin Mazin Zad al-Safar bin Al-Azd bin Al-Gharth bin Al-Nabit bin Malik bin Zaid bin Kahlan.\nTheir mother is Qilah bint Al-Arqam bin Amr bin Jafnah (it is said bint Kahil bin Udhrah bin Zura'ah).\nAl-Aws begot Malik (his mother is Hind bint Murr bin Kahil bin Udhrah bin Zura'ah). Malik begot five: Awf (they are the people of Quba), Amr (they are the people of the House [Bayt?]), Murr (they are the Ja'adirah, short black people), Jusham, and Imru' al-Qais (their mother is Hind bint Al-Khazraj, who is their cousin).\nFrom the descendants of Awf bin Malik bin Al-Aws are Banu Al-Sami'ah, who are Tha'labah, Awf, and Lawdhan, sons of Amr bin Awf bin Malik bin Al-Aws. They used to be called Banu Al-Samma', so the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) named them Banu Al-Sami'ah, and they became known by that from indoctrination.\nAmong them is Asim bin Thabit bin Abi Al-Aqlah, who is Qais bin Ismah bin Al-Nu'man bin Malik bin Umayyah bin Dubay'ah bin Zaid bin Malik bin Awf bin Amr bin Awf bin Malik bin Al-Aws. He is the one whom the swarm of bees/hornets protected (Hamathu al-Dubur - Dabr meaning swarm), and he is the victim of the bee when he was killed at Al-Raji'. From his descendants is the poet Al-Ahwas, who is Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Asim.\nHe said: In Ansar, it is Ummah bint Dubay'ah. In Dhubyan, it is Ummah Aliyah bint Mazin bin Tha'labah bin Sa'd. The rest of the Arabs, it is Umayyah (diminutive).\nAmong them is the one washed by Angels on the day of Uhud, Hanzalah bin Abi Amir, who is Abd Amr bin Al-Nu'man bin Malik bin Umayyah bin Dubay'ah to the end of the lineage.\nAmong them is Abdullah bin Jubayr bin Al-Nu'man bin Umayyah bin Al-Burak bin Imru' al-Qais bin Tha'labah bin Amr bin Awf bin Malik bin Al-Aws. Abdullah bin Jubayr was the commander of the archers on the hill on the Day of Uhud. When the polytheists were defeated, [his men] disobeyed him and descended the hill, but he stood firm with ten, so he was killed and they were killed with him. Jubayr's brother is Abdullah Khawwat bin Jubayr, owner of Dhat al-Nuhiyyayn in Jahiliyyah.\nAmong them is Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman bin Abi Layla, who is Sinan bin Bilal bin Uhayhah bin Al-Julah bin Al-Harish bin Jahjaba bin Kulfah bin Awf bin Amr bin Awf bin Malik bin Al-Aws. His son Muhammad held the judiciary in Kufa.\nAmong them is Al-Mundhir bin Uqbah bin Akhi Ibn al-Julah; he witnessed Badr and was killed on the Day of Bi'r Ma'unah. Uhayhah bin Al-Julah was in Jahiliyyah a noble master and poet. About him Khalid bin Ja'far bin Kilab Al-Kilabi says:\n\"If you intend disbelief in the family of Ya'rub...\nThen call out with a voice: O Uhayhah, defend [me].\"\nAmong them is Abu Umamah Sa'd bin Hunayf bin Wahb bin Al-Hakim bin Tha'labah bin Al-Harith bin Majda'ah bin Amr bin Hiyash bin Amr bin Awf bin Malik bin Al-Aws. The people agreed that he lead them in prayer while Amr [ibn al-As?] was besieged. Amr bin Hunayf is the brother of Sahl bin Hunayf; Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) appointed him.\n\n(Section)\nFrom Banu Amr bin Malik bin Al-Aws is the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) Sa'd bin Mu'adh bin Al-Nu'man bin Imru' al-Qais bin Zaid bin Abd al-Ashhal bin Jusham bin Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj bin Amr (who is Al-Nabit) bin Malik. He died [after] the Trench, and the Throne shook for his death. They are the people of Rabih [Ratij?], and they are the greatest of Medina. And Za'ura bin Abd al-Ashhal bin Jusham.\nAmong them is Al-Bara' bin Azib bin Al-Harith bin Jusham bin Harithah bin Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj bin Amr bin Malik bin Al-Aws.\nAmong them is the poet Qais bin Al-Khatim bin Adi bin Amr bin Sawad bin Zafar.\nAmong them is Abu Qatada Al-Nu'man bin Zaid bin Amir bin Sawad bin Zafar. His eye was hit on the Day of Uhud, so the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) returned it, and he could see with it again, and it was his better eye.\n\n(Section)\nFrom Banu Jusham bin Malik bin Al-Aws is Khatmah, who is Abdullah bin Jusham. He was named Khatmah because he struck a man with a sword on his nose (Khatm). They are a clan. Among them is the poet Ibn Harashah, killer of the Jewish woman who satirized the Prophet (peace be upon him). Among them is Dhu al-Shahadatayn (Possessor of Two Testimonies) Khuzaymah bin Thabit bin Al-Fakih bin Tha'labah bin Sa'idah bin Abab bin Amir bin Khatmah. He governed Kufa for Ibn al-Zubayr.\n\n(Section)\nFrom Banu Murrah bin Malik bin Al-Aws is the poet Abu Qais bin Al-Aslat Amir bin Jusham bin Zaid bin Qais bin Amir bin Murrah bin Malik bin Al-Aws.

She is the one about whom Qatari bin Al-Fuja'ah the Kharijite says a verse of poetry:\n\"By my life, I am abstinent in life...\nAnd in living, as long as I do not meet Umm Hakim.\"\nAmong them is Sa'd bin Khaythama bin Al-Harith bin Malik bin Al-Nahhat bin Ka'b bin Harithah bin Aslam bin Imru' al-Qais bin Malik bin Al-Aws. He witnessed Badr and was a Naqib (leader), and was killed on the Day of Uhud.\nThe clans of Al-Aws are Al-Nabit, Al-Ja'adirah, Banu Abd al-Ashhal, Banu Zafar, and Banu Khatmah.\n\n**Lineage of Al-Khazraj**\nHe said: Al-Khazraj begot five: Amr and Al-Harith (their mother is the daughter of Amir bin Al-Ghitrif Al-Azdi). Their brother Al-Harith bin Mu'awiyah Al-Kindi died before Islam. About him, Hassan bin Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) says:\n\"And if you call the two Hariths, the brother of Banu Kabdayha...\"\nAlso Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, Ka'b, Awf, and Jusham. Their mother is Mawiyah bint Ali bin Qais bin Ghassan. It used to be said: If you want glory, then perform Hajj in Jusham [seek refuge?]. Jusham is the family of Rabih.\nFrom that, the children of Amr bin Al-Khazraj: Taym Allah bin Tha'labah bin Amr bin Al-Khazraj. He has three names: Taym Allah, Al-Bahhar, and Al-Ayr. He was named Al-Bahhar because he killed a man and split (bahara) his head with an adze, or it is said because he circumcised himself with an adze. His mother is Al-Saduq bint Malik from Himyar.\nFrom Banu Al-Bahhar is the poet of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), Hassan bin Thabit bin Hizam bin Amr bin Zaid Manat bin Adi bin Amr bin Malik bin Al-Najjar.\nAmong them is Abu Ayyub, who is Khalid bin Zaid bin Kulayb bin Tha'labah bin Abdah.\nAmong them is Ubayy bin Ka'b bin Qais bin Ubayd bin Mu'awiyah bin Amr bin Malik bin Al-Najjar bin Awf bin Uthman bin Malik bin Al-Najjar. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stayed with him in Medina.\nAmong them is Abu Talha, who is Zaid bin Sahl Al-Aswad bin Haram to the end of the lineage. Abu Talha was one of the noted archers. He witnessed Hunayn and used to shoot in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying: \"My soul is a ransom for your soul, and my face a protection for your face.\" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"The voice of Abu Talha in the army is better than a hundred men.\"\nAmong them are Banu Al-Hasan bin Malik bin Amir bin Ghanam bin Adi bin Al-Najjar. About them Hassan bin Thabit says:\n\"The dwellings of Banu Al-Has'has are desolate...\nThe winds and the sky have erased them.\"\nAmong them is the servant of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), Anas bin Malik bin Al-Nadr bin Damdam bin Zaid bin Khuzam bin Jandal bin Amr bin Amir bin Ghanam bin Adi bin Al-Najjar. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) blessed him with wealth and children, so he lived until the time of Abd al-Malik bin Marwan and did not die until one hundred children issued from his loins.\nMuhammad bin Sirin is the client of Anas bin Malik, and Al-Hasan bin Al-Husayn Al-Basri is the client of Jamilah bint Qutbah, wife of Anas bin Malik. Abu Khalid Muhammad bin Sirin is the brother of Anas bin Malik [by milk?] to Al-Bara' bin Malik. (Umm Al-Hasan is Umm Sulaym bint Milhan bin Khalid bin Zaid bin Khuzam bin Jundab to the end of the lineage). The Scribe of Ibn Sirin [or Ibn Sirin the scribe], Abu Muhammad bin Sirin and Anas died in Basra, from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).\nFrom Banu Mazin bin Al-Najjar is Habib bin Zaid bin 'Asim bin Amr bin Awf bin Mabdhul bin Amr bin Ghanam bin Mazin bin Al-Najjar. Musaylimah said to him: \"Testify that there is no god but Allah.\" He said it. Then he said: \"Testify that I am the Messenger of Allah.\" He said to him: \"I do not hear.\" He said: \"As for this, you do not hear?\" So he cut off his hand. Then he repeated the speech to him, and he did as his first action, so he cut off his other hand. He kept repeating it to him until he cut off his legs. He repeated it, and he said: \"I testify that Musaylimah is a liar. I did not testify while I was whole, shall I testify while I am cut to pieces?\" So he cut out his tongue and he died, may Allah have mercy on him.\n\n(Section)\nFrom the descendants of Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj...",

He is the one who said on the Day of Saqifah: \"A leader from us and a leader from you,\" and did not pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr or Umar. He was killed by Jinn in Hawran.

They ruled for six hundred and sixteen years until Islam came.\nAll of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj are Ghassani, except those of them who were in Oman.

They are worshipers called Banu Thaqilah. This Abd al-Masih is the nephew (sister's son) of Satih the Soothsayer, and he is the one whom Khosrau sent to Satih because of the vision Khosrau saw; its story is famous.\nAmong them is Jidha' bin Amr bin Mukhalid bin Al-Harith bin Amr bin Adi bin Mazin.

She is the one mentioned by Al-Nabighah when he said:\n\"And Thawr bin Marar died on the Day of Halimah...\nOver time, all experiences have been tried.\"\nThe Day of Halimah is a great famous day among the days of the Arabs. It is proverbial. It was between Ghassan, kings of Sham, and Lakhm, kings of Iraq. It is the one proverbially referred to as: \"The Day of Halimah is no secret.\"\nAmong them is Jabalah bin Al-Ayham bin Al-Harith bin Tha'labah bin Amr bin Jafnah. He is the one who accepted Islam then became Christian and joined the Romans, then regretted it. He is the one who said:\n\"The nobles became Christian due to the shame of a slap...\nAnd there was no harm in it had I been patient.\"\nAmong the kings of Ghassan, the most faithful of Arabs in protection, is Al-Samaw'al bin Adiya bin Hassan bin Rifa'ah bin Al-Harith bin Tha'labah bin Ka'b bin Amr bin Amir. He is the owner of Tayma' whom Al-A'sha mentioned saying:\n\"Al-Ablaq Al-Fard of Tayma' is his home...\nA fortified fortress and a neighbor not treacherous.\"\nHe said: From Ghassan are Asa, Rabi'ah, Imru' al-Qais, and Mawiyah, clans in Hijaz.\nAnd Banu Amr bin Al-Azd, and they are not from the descendants of Mazin.\nHe said: There may be among the descendants of Mazin those who are not from Ghassan.\nThe clans of Ghassan are Al-Aws, Al-Khazraj, the descendants of Mazin bin Al-Azd, the descendants of Jafnah bin Amr, some descendants of Amr bin Al-Azd, and some descendants of Afsa bin Luhay. So understand that.\n\n**Lineage of Khuza'ah**\nHe said: Khuza'ah are the children of Rabi'ah, who are Luhay and Afsa, sons of Harithah bin Amr bin Amir.\nRabi'ah begot Amr. Amr begot Ka'b, Malih, Sa'd, Awf, and Adi.\nThey were named Khuza'ah because of their separation (Inkhiza') from Banu Amr bin Amir. Inkhiza' means lagging behind and holding back. Regarding that, the poet says:\n\"When we descended the valley of Marr, Khuza'ah separated...\nWhatever was in the bellies of Karakir [?].\"",

    "text": "The children of Afsa bin Harithah are Aslam, Malkan (with Fatha on Mim and Kasra), and Malik, sons of Afsa. They are Khuza'ah because of their separation from Banu Mazin from Al-Azd during their approach from Yemen. So all of Khuza'ah settled in Marr al-Zahran around the Haram. They held the guardianship (Hijabah) of the Kaaba for a long time. They are allies of Banu Hashim. For this reason, Abdullah bin Al-Abbas said: The Quran was revealed in the dialect of the two Ka'bs: Ka'b bin Lu'ay and Ka'b bin Amr bin Luhay.\nIt is said of Khuza'ah: Allies of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with him in the document of the treaty in the Year of Hudaybiyyah, until he made peace with the polytheists of Quraysh. Quraysh included with it Banu Bakr bin Abd Manat bin Kinanah. A war occurred between Khuza'ah and Banu Bakr bin Abd Manat bin Kinanah. The polytheists of Quraysh helped their allies Banu Bakr and thereby broke the covenant. That was the cause for the Conquest of Mecca. He gave them a status he gave to no one else: he made them Emigrants (Muhajirin) while they were in their land, and wrote a document for them to that effect.\n\n**Children of Amr bin Luhay and Afsa from the Lineage of Khuza'ah**",

    "text": "And that Khath'am, whose name is Aftal (his mother is Hind bint Al-Ghafiq bin Qumk), was named Khath'am after a camel of Anmar. When they traveled on it, it smeared (Khath'ama) [or they smeared themselves with blood]. It is said because they smeared themselves (Takhath'amu) with blood. The name of Bajilah is Abqar bin Anmar. From the descendants of Anmar are Al-Gharth and Suhaybah, and their mother is Bajilah bint Sa'b bin Sa'd Al-Ashirah.\nThose who said Bajilah and Khath'am are from Yemen argued with what was narrated by Farwah bin Musayk Al-Ghutayfi, Tamim Al-Dari, and Abdullah bin Al-Abbas. The most complete is the Hadith of Farwah bin Musayk, he said: I said, O Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), inform me about Saba, what is it? Is it a mountain, a valley, a man, a woman, or a land? The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"It is not a mountain, nor a land, nor a woman, but a man who begot ten from the Arabs. Six of them went south (Yemen) and four went north (Sham). As for those who went north: Lakhm, Judham, Amilah, and Ghassan. As for those who went south: Himyar, Al-Azd, Kindah, Al-Ash'ar, Madhhij, and Anmar.\"\nIn the Hadith of Abu Sittah, a man said: O Messenger of Allah, which Anmar? Is it the one containing Bajilah and Khath'am? [Implicitly yes].\nAfsa argued with the saying of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him): \"A man from the best of Dhu Yaman will appear to you, upon him is a touch of kingship.\" Then Jarir bin Abdullah Al-Bajali appeared, and he was one of the most handsome and tallest of Arabs.\nIt is said that the reason Khath'am transferred its lineage to Nizar was a war that occurred between them and Nahd bin Zaid. Nahd, Janb, Sinhan, and Zubid allied against them and harmed Khath'am. So they attributed themselves to Nizar and said: We are Banu Kalb bin 'Afras bin Hilf bin Aftal, we are Banu Kalb bin Rabi'ah bin Nizar. And Shahran Al-Aridah said: We are Banu Anmar bin Nizar. So Anz, Adwan, and those near them from the tribes of Nizar supported them.\nWe return now to mentioning the lineage.\nAs for Bajilah, his name is Abqar. From the descendants of Bajilah is Jarir bin Abdullah bin Al-Salil, who is Jabir bin Malik bin Nasr bin Tha'labah bin Jusham bin Awf bin Khuzaymah bin Harith bin Adi bin Malik bin Sa'd bin Zaid bin Qais (who is Malik bin Abqar, who is Bajilah). He came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and he spread his cloak for him. It was said of Jarir that he is the Joseph of this Ummah for his beauty. Jarir bin Abdullah accepted Islam forty days before the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him). About him the poet says:\n\"Were it not for Jarir, Bajilah would have perished...\nWhat an excellent youth, the lineage of the tribe.\"\nFrom Bajilah is Al-Kahin Saniq bin Sa'b bin Yashkur to the end of the lineage.\nAmong them is Judge Abu Yusuf, who is Ya'qub bin Ibrahim bin Habib bin Sa'd.\nAmong them is Khalid bin Abdullah bin Zaid bin Asad bin Karb bin Amir bin Abdullah bin Abd Shams bin Khath'amah bin Jarir bin Sa'd Al-Kahin bin Sa'b bin Yashkur bin Ath'am [? Khath'am?] bin Afrak bin Yazid bin Qar bin Abqar. From the clans of Bajilah is Khalid bin Abdullah Al-Qasri.\nFrom their clans is Uraynah bin Zaid bin Qasr bin Abqar. Among them are the Uraynis who took the camels of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and he did with them what he did, and their story is famous.\n\n(Section)\nAs for Khath'am, his name is Aftal. From his descendants is Anas bin Mudrikah bin Amr bin Sa'd bin Awf bin Al-Ulayth bin Harithah bin Amr bin Taym Allah bin Mubashir bin Aklub bin Rabi'ah bin 'Afras bin Hilf bin Khath'am.\nAmong them is the guide of the Abyssinians, Nufayl bin Habib bin Abdullah bin Harith bin Amir bin Malik bin Wahb bin Halimah (who is Al-Harith bin Aklub bin Rabi'ah bin 'Afras bin Hilf bin Khath'am).\nAmong them is Aban bin Al-Walid bin Malik bin Abdullah (who is Abu Hasa) bin Al-Harith bin Amir bin Al-Amarah bin Sa'd bin As'ad bin Zuhl bin Awf bin Wadad bin Tha'labah bin Khath'am.\nThe clans of Khath'am are Shahran, Nahis, and Karar bin 'Afras.\nFrom the descendants of [bin] Al-Gharth are Dhubyan bin Tha'labah bin Mu'awiyah bin Zaid bin Al-Gharth, Aklub bin Rabi'ah bin 'Afras, Al Shahran, and Al Nahis.\nAs for 'Afras, in them are the number and honor of Khath'am. From Khath'am is Ham bin Nahis. Al-Hutay'ah said:\n\"I gathered from Amir in them and from Asad...\nAnd from Tamim and from Haw and from Ham.\"\n\n(Section)\nAs for Ahmas bin Al-Gharth bin Anmar",

So whoever was from the children of Malik bin Udad is Madhhiji. It is said Madhhij are various tribes that gathered (Tamadhhajat), i.e., assembled; you say 'Madhhajtu al-shay'a' if you gathered it.\nIbn Al-Kalbi said: Malik, Tayy, and Al-Ash'ar are sons of Udad bin Madhhij. There is difference regarding Tayy bin Udad. A group said Zunn is brother of Malik, their mother is Madhhij, and he is Madhhij, this one. Some say Madhhij is a woman's name. Others said Tayn [Tayy?] is brother of Malik, and Layla is a mother to her [them?], and this is the correct view, Allah knows best.",

When Islam came, Abu Musa migrated among the Ash'aris to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in a ship. The wind cast them to the land of the Negus (Najashi), where they found Ja'far bin Abi Talib and his companions. They remained with them until they left in two ships.

It is said they had a fourth brother named Majdi bin Qais, and it is said Majdi is Abu Burdah.\nAbu Burdah bin Abi Musa was a judge over Kufa, and his son Bilal was a judge over Basra.

He was killed on the Day of Awtas while commanding for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) after killing nine in duels. Abu Amir is the one about whom the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Excellent is the tribe Al-Azd and the Ash'aris; they do not flee in battle nor steal spoils. They are from me and I am from them.\"\nAs for Abu Burdah, brother of Abu Musa, his name is Amir bin Qais; he has companionship and narration. Abu Burdah bin Abi Musa is also Amir, his narration is from his father as well. The third Abu Burdah is Yazid bin Abdullah bin Abi Burdah bin Abi Musa.\nHe said: From the descendants of Ash'ar are Amir and Arid - two origins from which many clans branched. They are sons of Udhar bin Wa'il bin Najiyah bin Al-Jamahir bin Al-Ash'ar.\nFrom the descendants of Amir are Sha'dhaf, Baqdam, Jamad, and Shahlah. It is said Jamad and Shahlah are sons of Wa'il bin Ash'ar.\nFrom the descendants of Amir the Younger is Awsham; his children are called Al-Awarishm, and they are in the mountain, companions of Zaymah Al-Ash'ari.",

And Ziyad and Murid, sons of Abu Kabshah, who is Jibril bin Sayyarah bin Hayy bin Qurt bin Safal bin Al-Muqallad bin Ma'di Karib bin Urayf bin Al-Saksak.\nIt is said that from Banu Al-Saksak are Hani, Udrah, Mudhakir, Bakwah, Saharah, Al-Miqdas, Tamah, and Da'im, sons of Saksak.\nFrom Al-Israr is Amr bin Sa'd bin Habil, who is the head of Al-Israr.\nIbn Ishaq said: Al-Sakasik bin Wa'ilah bin Himyar bin Saba.

Others said: Ibn Amr bin Malik bin Ashras bin Kindah. Some said: Mushal bin Amr bin Ami bin Hadramaut bin Safinsah [?] to Hadramaut. Those of the descendants of Malik Al-Sadaf in the land of Hadramaut attribute themselves to Kindah, and those in Kufa attribute themselves to Hadramaut. It is Al-Sadaf with Kasra on Dal. If you attribute to it, you open it and say Sadafi, just as you attribute to Thamarah, Shaqrah, and Salamah (a clan of Ansar), saying Thamari, Shaqari, and Salami with Fatha in all.\nAs for Tujib, it is said she is a woman from Madhhij, daughter of Thawban bin Sulaym bin Ruha. Her children bin Ufayr bin Adi bin Al-Harith bin Murrah bin Udad (who is Abu Kindah) were attributed to her. Tujib gave birth in Al-Sukun bin Kindah, so they are the nobles of Al-Sukun.\nIt is said that Tujib are Adi and Sa'd sons of Ashras bin Shabib bin Al-Sukun, and their mother is Najib bint Thawban. Among them is Al-Tujibi, one of the killers of Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, and his lineage has passed.\nThis is the lineage of Kindah, who is Thawr bin Ufayr bin Adi bin Al-Harith bin Murrah bin Udad bin Zaid bin Amr bin Urayb bin Zaid bin Kahlan. It is said Al-Harith bin Murrah bin Al-Harith bin Hadramaut bin Saba the Younger from Himyar. Allah knows best the truth.",

Al-Ashras begot two clans: Al-Sukun and Al-Sakasik, and we have mentioned them.\nThese are the famous tribes of Kahlan attributed to Zaid bin Kahlan. The children of Zaid are Malik and Urayb, as we mentioned. We attributed the children of Zaid to Malik, and Urayb to Zaid bin [Kahlan].\nFrom the descendants of Malik bin Zaid bin Kahlan are Al-Azd, Khath'am, Bajilah, and Hamdan.

He was sent to four tribes of Qahtan who were in the East: Yar'u and Bal and Qadman sons of Yamin bin Qahtan, and Aslam and Abu Wra' sons of Al-Harith bin Qahtan. They denied him, killed him, and threw him into a well called Al-Rass. They are the ones Allah Almighty mentioned saying: {And the Companions of the Rass}. Some poets of Qahtan said about them:\n\"My eye wept for the people of Bar'wil and Qadman...\nAnd Aslam and to Zar' basar to Qahtan.\"\nAmong them is the wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him), Qutwazah bint Basturah.\nAmong them is Radman bin Al-Gharth bin Haydan bin Qatan.

Al-Kala' are numerous in Yemen, and most of them are in Sham.\nIn Jabal Sabr are Banu Al-Mu'allim bin Abd al-Rahman bin Shurahbil bin Ya'fur bin Bakur.\nIn Hajjah are Banu Al-Shami from the descendants of Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abd al-Rahim bin Abdullah bin Abd al-Rahman bin Shurahbil bin Ya'fur bin Bakur.\nAmong them is a group in the land of Ayan.\nAmong them are the Abbasids of Surdad and Al-Hattal the Astronomers of Tur, from the descendants of Bujayr bin Risan bin Sa'dan bin Ma'di bin Zura'ah bin Thumamah bin Al-Aswad bin Amr bin Malik.\nHe said: Al-Kala' is a verbal noun. Clans from Himyar gathered and 'Takalla'at'. Takallu' is gathering, like Tashakkul, Taqarrush, and Tahassud, meaning one. They gathered to ally in adjacent homelands in the land of Himyar, and they gathered to be neighbors. Most homelands are named after their owner. These clans allied under the leadership of the Qayl (Chief) Ibn Al-Nu'man bin Zaid bin Shihal bin Wahazah. They were eighteen tribes. Muhammad bin Al-Hasan bin Ahmad bin Ya'qub Al-Hamdani mentioned they were nineteen tribes, and included Manah bin Abd Shams among them.\nThese are the names of the tribes: Wahazah and Maytam sons of Sa'd bin Awf. Al-Sahul and Al-Jayir sons of Sawadah bin Amr bin Awf. Rayman, Gharwan, Ba'dan (he and Jusham Al-Uzma bin Abd Shams bin Wa'il). Al-Ashru', Nakhlan, Uran, and Anan, sons of Mathub bin Urayb bin Zuhayr bin Ayman bin Al-Hamisa' bin Himyar.

And Al-Tafa'ah bin Abd bin the King Al-Suwwar bin Wa'il the King.\nThese tribes allied (Takalla'at) upon Zaid bin Al-Nu'man bin Yazid bin Shihal bin Wahazah and made him a Qayl for them in the time of Tubba' Al-Aqran Malik As'ad bin Malik the First. Then he made Yazid bin Ya'fur bin Yazid bin Al-Nu'man a Qayl over these divisions of tribes, so Yazid was named Dhu Al-Kala' meaning (Leader of the Kala'). He was on the right wing of Tubba' when he invaded the land of Persia. Regarding that As'ad the Tubba' says:\n\"And We placed on the Right Flank\nBrother of War, Dhu Al-Kala' Yazid.\nRashid in command in war and endeavor\nNeither reckless, hasty nor cowardly.\"\n\nSection: Among them are the family of Dhu Yazan, to whom Yazani spears are attributed.

His wealth was looted due to his intense generosity [Manhaban?].\nAmong them is Al-Thamar bin Farmal bin Amr bin Sinan bin Al-Gharth bin Sa'd bin Adi bin Malik bin Zaid bin Sadad bin Zur'ah bin Saba the Younger.\nAmong them is the family of Dhu Baghamah, who is Amr bin Amir bin Amr bin Al-Nu'man bin Qais bin Ubayd bin Al-Sayf the Elder.\nHe said: The family of Dhu Yazan are between Al-Haj and Marjah, and they are Al-Athrun. Lunays Biljaj Muhammad bin Isma'il was a noble master.\nThey have large numbers and huge crowds in Hadramaut and Yemen, and many of them are in Homs and Sham.\nAmong them is the family of Dhu Yahr the Younger, who is Yaghfar bin Zaid bin Shurahbil bin Shamir bin Zur'ah bin Shurahbil bin Awf bin Ya'fur bin Al-Harith bin Sharh Al Yaghfar Dhi Yahr the Elder bin Al-Harith bin Sa'd bin Malik bin Awf bin Adi bin Malik bin Zaid bin Sadad bin Zur'ah bin Saba the Younger.\nAmong them is the genealogist Abu Nasr Muhammad Abdullah bin Sa'id bin Ubaydullah bin Muhammad bin Wahb Al Shurahbil bin Ghuraib bin Wahb bin Al-Zaid Dhi Yahr the Younger.\nAmong them is Hadur bin Adi bin Malik bin Zaid bin Sadad bin Zur'ah bin Saba the Younger.\nAmong them is the Prophet Shu'ayb, peace be upon him, bin Dhi Mahdam bin Al-Muqaddam bin Hadur. Allah - Exalted - sent him to the people of Hadur, but they killed him. When they heard a caller saying:\n\"A people will know who fought Allah openly...\nEven if they plotted, He was stronger and more cunning.\nThus Allah misguides he who has a disease in his heart...\"\nSo Allah sent the Prophet Marhaba from the tribe of Judah bin Jacob to Nebuchadnezzar and ordered him to invade the Arabs who killed their prophet among them, so Allah - Exalted - destroyed them at his hands.\nHadur is a mountain in Yemen containing his grave and his house known as Bayt Shu'ayb today. As for Hadur Yanasib, it is in Shardad Wadi Al-Mahjam.\nHe said: From the descendants of Hadur is Dhu Ridwan, and the Ridwanis today are in Al-Hajadib.

    "text": "As for Al-Adwa', it is everyone whose name begins with (Dhu), such as Dhi Manakh, Dhi Ru'ayn, Dhi Al-Kala', Dhi Maqar, Dhi Yahr, Dhi Sahar, Dhi Murrah, Dhi Tha'laban, Dhi Athkalan, Dhi Khalil, Dhi Tarah, Dhi Fayfan, Dhi Yazan, Dhi Asbah, Dhi Tarakhum, Dhi Yahsub, and Dhi Fayish, among others too long to mention. They are of the status of Emirs.\nAs for Al-Thaminah (the Eight), they are eight from Himyar. When Sayf Dhi Yazan died, the people of Yemen were returned to these eight houses: Al Dhi Yazan, Al Khalil, Al Athkalan, Al Dhi Tha'laban, Al Dhi Ma'ahir, and Al Dhi Jadan [only 6 listed?]. The greatest of them was Al Dhi Yazan due to the birth of Abi Karib As'ad Al-Kamil to them (Bani As'ad Al-Kamil), and Al Dhi Manakh because they are the uncles of the Tubba's. The other six houses used to see superiority over them.\nHe said: Kingship among the people of Yemen was in seven categories: (Himyar, Azd, Hamdan, Bajilah, Kindah, Tayy, and Lakhm). That is mentioned in places of the book, so understand that.\n\n**Lineage of Quda'ah**\nHe is Ibn Malik bin Amr bin Murrah bin Zaid bin Malik bin Himyar. The derivation of Quda'ah is from 'Qad'', which is overcoming, because they overcame. The name of Quda'ah was Amr. It is said he was called Quda'ah Amr, then when the might of his people was shattered (Taqadda'a), i.e., went far, he was named Quda'ah.\nPeople differed regarding the lineage of Quda'ah: A group said Quda'ah bin Ma'ad bin Adnan. He is Bakrah, and was nicknamed by it. It is said Quda'ah is a woman from Jurhum whom Ma'ad bin Adnan married, then Malik bin Amr succeeded upon her, and she gave birth to Quda'ah on the bed of Malik, so he was attributed to Malik. Arabs used to attribute men to their mother's husband, as they attributed Banu Abd Manat bin Kinanah to Ali bin Mas'ud Al-Azdi because he succeeded Abd Manat bin Kinanah upon his wife, and children were born to him from her, so he nursed his children and Abd Manat's children from her, so they were all attributed to him, and were called Banu Ali. Likewise, Sa'd Hudhaym from Quda'ah is Sa'd bin Zaid, Hudhaym nursed him so he was attributed to his nurse. Likewise, Ukl nursed Banu Awf bin Qais bin Wa'il bin Awf bin Abd Manat, so they were attributed to their nurses. As for Ghusayn, Bulan nursed him so it prevailed over his name. Aswadan, Nabhan nursed him so it prevailed over his name. Tha'labah, a woman called Jurhum nursed him so it prevailed over his name.\nIt is said that Mu'anah Al-Jurhumiyyah was under Amr bin Malik bin Murrah bin Zaid bin Malik bin Himyar and bore Quda'ah. Then Ma'ad bin Adnan married her. She was from the people of Mecca. The Himyari married her at the time of Hajj, then Ma'ad bin Adnan married her after him, and she bore him Nizar. Quda'ah was raised with his brother Nizar in the lap of Ma'ad bin Adnan, so he was attributed to him.\nOthers said: Quda'ah is son of Himyar. This is what people are upon today, and is famous among them.\nAl-Aflah bin Ya'qub Al-Quda'i from the descendants of Abd Manat from Mashja'ah bin Al-Taym bin Al-Nahr bin Barrah said: \"We are Banu Al-Sheikh Al-Hayjan Al-Azhari, Quda'ah bin Malik bin Himyar. The lineage is known, not denied; whoever says other than it will not be supported.\"\n\"O caller, call us and rejoice...\nAnd be Quda'i and do not be Nizari.\"\nHe said: The reason for the departure of Quda'ah bin Ma'ad [sic] bin Khuzaymah bin Zaid Al-Quda'i is that he loved Fatimah bint Yadhkur bin Anazah bin Asad bin Rabi'ah bin Nizar. He is the one who said:\n\"When Al-Jauza' was followed by Al-Thurayya...\nI thought thoughts about the family of Fatimah.\"\nHe said: So he proposed to her father, but he refused to marry her to him. Her father used to come between them. One day he and her father were absent gathering Qaraz. Khuzaymah killed him and hid his news. They asked him about him, he said: My last meeting with him was that he came to one of the two Qarizs about whom Abu Dhu'ayb says:\n\"Until the two Qarizs return, both of them...\nAnd Kulayb is resurrected for Wa'il.\"\nHe said: His news was hidden from his people until Khuzaymah bin Nahd said:\n\"A girl, on her mouth was wine...\nMixed with ginger.\nI killed her father for her love...\nWill that facilitate closeness or will I attain [?].\"\nThen Rabi'ah knew of his killing him, so war and fighting erupted between them until Khuzaymah was killed. Quda'ah left their homes; they used to dwell from Mecca and Ta'if, while Rabi'ah dwelt at Marr Asfan. Quda'ah scattered in Sham and denied Ma'ad bin Adnan and attributed themselves to Al-Namir.\nAl-Sharqi bin Al-Qatami said: Quda'ah remained in Ma'ad in Jahiliyyah and early Islam until the days of Ibn al-Zubayr and Abd al-Malik bin Marwan. Seditions and raids occurred between Umair bin Al-Hubab Al-Sulami against Kalb, and raids of Humayd bin Al-Harith bin Harb bin Bajdal Al-Kalbi against Fazarah. So Quda'ah allied with the people of Yemen, and the lineage of Yemen prevailed over Quda'ah.",

    "text": "Muhammad bin Habib said: The lineage of Quda'ah was only corrupted by the war that was between Sham in the days of Humayd bin Hurayth and Umair bin Al-Hubab. That is because Khalid bin Zaid bin Mu'awiyah was opposing Banu Marwan and those who supported them, and fanatical against them. He said to his maternal uncles from Kalb, who are the masters of Quda'ah: \"Obey me\" - and he was obeyed among them - \"and ally with Yemen and attribute yourselves to them, for you will humiliate the rule of Banu Marwan and those who support them from Qais Ghaylan.\" Some obeyed him and others disobeyed. Some used to say: \"We allied with Yemen,\" and some said: \"We are from them.\" The poet said:\n\"Quda'ah claimed it is from Himyar...\nMay God cut off the nose of the liar Quda'ah.\"\nAbd al-Malik bin Habib said: I heard Muhammad bin Salam Al-Basri the Genealogist say: The Arabs are three roots: Nizar, Yemen, and Quda'ah. It was said to him: Is Nizar more or Yemen? He said: Whatever Quda'ah wills; if it joins Ma'ad, Nizar is more, and if it joins Yemen, Yemen is more. These sayings are as you see, and the lineage of Yemen prevailed over Quda'ah. Understand that.\nHe said: Quda'ah are all three clans: Banu Imran, Banu Aslam, Banu Amr. All are sons of Al-Haf bin Quda'ah. Quda'ah had children: Al-Hami, Al-Hari, Wadi'ah, and Ubadah.\nSection: As for Imran bin Al-Haf, from his descendants are the Kings of Daj'am. They are three: Amr the King bin Malik, the King bin Al-Nu'man, and the King Daj'am (who is Amr bin Sa'd bin Salij, whose name is Amr bin Hulwan bin Imran bin Al-Haf bin Quda'ah).\nAmong them is Dawud Al-Labaq bin Amr bin Daj'am bin Shaybah bin Amr bin Awf bin Daj'am.\nAmong them is Al-Harith bin Maydalah bin Hawtharah bin Amr bin Awf bin Daj'am.\nAmong them is Jarm, who are Amr and Awf sons of Raban bin Hulwan bin Imran bin Al-Haf bin Quda'ah. From Jarm are Malkan (moving Lam), Qudamah, Jiddam, and Najiyah, sons of Jarm.\nAmong them are Ma'dhirah bin Adi bin Sumayr bin Matrud bin Qudamah bin Jarm, and A'jab bin Qudamah bin Jarm, and Rasib bin Al-Khazraj bin Jaddah bin Jarm.\nAs for Raban, these are with open Ra and stressed Ba.\nFrom the descendants of Raban are Mu'awiyah, Ra'ih, Awf, Wa'il, Ulaym, Awf, Asad, Abid, Tazid, Jadrah, and Arwan. Among them is Washiq bin Udhrah bin Mu'awiyah bin Raban.\n\n(Section) Among them is Tazid (with two dots above) bin Hulwan bin Imran. To them the Tazidi cloaks are attributed. There is no Tazid in Arabs except Tazid bin Hulwan in Quda'ah and Tazid in Ansar. The rest is with Ya with two dots below. Understand that.\n\n(Section) From the descendants of Wabrah bin Taghlib Al-Ghalba' bin Hulwan bin Imran are Kalb, Al-Asad, Al-Namir, Al-Dhi'b, Al-Sirhan, Al-Sid, Al-Dab', Al-Fahd, Al-Dubb, Al-Tha'lab, Al-Dabb, and Al-Wabar. Among them is Tanukh, whose name is Fahm bin Asad bin Wabrah. They are three. It is said Tanukh is a name for tribes from Quda'ah who agreed on that. The meaning of Tanukh is staying/residing (Tuqim).\nAmong them is Al-Qayn, who is Al-Nu'man bin Jasr bin Shi' Allah bin Al-Asad bin Wabrah. And Al-Gharth bin Taym bin Al-Nahr bin Wabrah.\nAmong them is the Soothsayer Satih, who is Rabi'ah bin Amr bin Al-Dhi'b bin Wabrah.

A Companion, Emigrant. He was married to Duba'ah bint Al-Abbas bin Abd al-Muttalib. He is the Knight of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, on the Day of Badr. His father Amr was an ally of Al-Aswad bin Abd Yaghuth Al-Bakri from Quraysh, who died and Al-Aswad succeeded upon his wife, so he was attributed to him. Abu Al-Miqdad had been captured to Hadramaut, stayed in Kindah for a time, then was released and settled in Mecca, so he was called Al-Kindi. However, Al-Kindi is Al-Miqdad bin Ma'di, one of the Emigrant Companions. So understand that.\nAs for Bali bin Amr bin Al-Haf bin Quda'ah, from his descendants is Al-Mujadhdhar bin Ziyad bin Zamzamah bin Amr bin Amarah (with Fatha on Ayn and Shadda on Mim) bin Malik bin Yashir bin Amr bin Qais bin Taym bin Sa'd bin Arash bin Amir bin Umaylah bin Qasmil bin Maran bin Bali.

All these tribes, their call is: O family of Haydan.\nHe said: Banu Amr bin Al-Haf bin Quda'ah were in Ma'rib, and they are Bahra', Bali, Khawlan, and Haydan. They separated when the Kings of Yemen expelled them to govern the countries. Bahra' and Bali were among those expelled in the campaign of Quda'ah to Sham along with Kalb, Salih, Taym, and Al-Wabar [Al-Bark?]. Juhaynah, Nahd, Udhrah Banu Zaid, and Khazam bin Zabban were among those sent to Hijaz. Then Nahd returned to the land of Najd with a group from Jarm. The rest settled in Hijaz.

    "text": "As for Sa'd bin Khawlan, he is the King in Sirwah. He had four children: Rabi'ah, Sa'd, Al-Harith, and Amr. Qaladih Amr.\nAs for Rabi'ah bin Sa'd, in him are wealth and numbers. He had children: Rashwan, Sa'd, Kamil, Muzawwad, Nu'aym, Dahikah, Hajar, and Aqariab.\nAmong them is the one who came to Al-Mu'tadid Billah, Ahmad bin Abdullah bin Abbad bin Muhammad bin Kathir bin Jarir bin Hajar bin Raghbah bin Sa'd bin Khawlan.\nAmr bin Zaid bin Asmah is Mughriq the Elder. He was named Mughriq because he carried Banu Bajr on riding the sea, and a group of them drowned. The rest went out to Egypt and lived there. Among them are Al-Muslim, Ahmad, and Abdullah, sons of Muhammad bin Abbad.\nFrom the descendants of Abbad also are Muhkam, Muslim, Hajjaj, Al-Wajih, Ahmad, and Al-Haydam. He is a man of Khawlan and owner of Al-Qanakat and Al-Manasib Al-Ulumiyyin and the tribes of their workers.\nAl-Haydam rebelled against the Sultan and opposed. That is because Hammad appointed Al-Haydam. Al-Haydam's sister, a slave girl, was described to him [Hammad]... [text corrupted]... her son Nafisah. He sent to buy her, and she was... [text unclear]. She said: Her matter is to Al-Haydam. Al-Haydam was at Jabal Batkas. He made... and sent someone who broke in on her and took her. The news reached her brother Al-Haydam, so he went down to La'ah and struck the neck of the agent. He wrote to Hammad informing him of his deed, and that he killed some clients without his order, and that he seeks justice from him. He hated making peace with him, so Al-Haydam found no escape from fighting him. He fought him for a time, then Hammad overcame him and sent him to Iraq with a group of his companions. Among them was Al-Dahhak bin Kathir Al-Umari.\nWhen they reached Harun Al-Rashid, he said to Al-Haydam: \"You are the one rebelling against the Commander of the Faithful and killer of his soldiers with sedition?\" Hammad had secretly instructed someone to advise Al-Haydam, saying to him: \"If the Commander of the Faithful asks you about your harem, admit it, for he will pardon you.\" He said: \"Yes.\" Harun permitted his killing, so he ordered it and his neck was struck.\nThen he called Al-Dahhak bin Kathir and mentioned that to him. He said: \"The one who did that is Hammad your servant,\" and mentioned the desire to him and how the affair of Al-Haydam started. Harun regretted killing Al-Haydam, released Al-Dahhak and his companions, greeted them, ordered them carried to Yemen, and was angry with Hammad until he died.\nAmong them is the master of Quda'ah in his time, who undertook the war against Rabi'ah bin Nizar and expelled them from Yemen, Amr bin Malik bin Zaid bin Usamah bin Zaid bin Artah to the end of the lineage.\nAmong them is Malik the Younger and Al-Asba', sons of Hajar bin Sa'd bin Amr, whose lineage we presented.\nAmong them is the grandfather of Al-Akul, Yazid bin Al-Mutawakkil bin Hajar bin Sa'd bin Amr.\nFrom the descendants of Yazid Al-Mutawakkil are the family of Al-Mughirah, the family of Al-Harith, and the family of Ghanam, sons of Yazid bin Amr bin Zaid bin Al-Tawakkil.\nAmong them is Mughriq, one of the archers and poets of Khawlan.\nFrom the descendants of Al-Asba' is Yazid bin Amr bin Abdullah bin Al-Asba'. As for the children of Sahl bin Al-Asba', they joined Jabal Hayum, so his descendants today are in Al-Ahyum.\nFrom the descendants of Al-Layth bin Malik bin Yazid bin Usamah bin Zaid bin Artah are Malik, Al-Ubayd, and Amr bin Al-Layl. His sons Al-Ubayd and Malik are in Banu Hajar bin Zaid. In Banu Al-Ubayd is the leadership of Banu Bahr.\nSa'd in Al-Layth was among the masters and nobles of Banu Malik. He is the one saying:\n\"Your time demands from you what we advanced...\nAnd what you aimed for became broken.\nIbn Hajar wanted a youth of my clan...\nAnd short of what he aimed for is cutting the nape.\"\nFrom the descendants of Awf bin Zaid bin Usamah bin Zaid bin Artah are Mas'ud, Kathir, Jabir, Malik, Rifa'ah, Sa'b, and Awd; all are clans. Wealth and valor were in the descendants of Awf, and in Banu Malik were sovereignty and unity.\nFrom Banu Awf is the Knight of Arabs, Master of Banu Awf, and Tongue of Khawlan, Amr bin Yazid bin Amr bin Mas'ud bin Amr bin Mas'ud bin Awf.\nAs for the children of Malik, Jabir, Rifa'ah, Sa'b, and Awd, they settled in the abode of Anz bin Wa'il, and they are there to this day. Among them is a group who went out with Banu Malik bin Zaid to Zubid and Hays. Likewise Amr, Jarir, Atik, and Jabir are houses; some of them went out to Zubid, Hays, and Tihamah with their sisters in Banu Awf.\nRegarding that, Amr, brother of Banu Awf, says:\n\"A group of us passed surrounding with spears...\nMshahim [?], their homes became in Zubid.\"",

    "text": "As for Sa'd bin Sa'd bin Khawlan, from his descendants are Harith, Ghalib, Samhak, and Qaym. Taym perished.\nFrom the descendants of Samhak bin Sa'd bin Sa'd are the people of Al-Khabith, the people of Mutarrif, Banu Salamah, Al Jarir, Al Akram, Salamah, and Samhak. These are the leaders of Banu Sa'd.\nAmong them are the people of Al-Arj. From the descendants of Ziyad bin Sulayman bin Al-Fahish bin Harith bin Sa'd bin Sa'd bin Khawlan.\nAmong them is Mahmoud bin Ali bin Amr bin Jabir bin Amr bin Musafir bin Amr bin Ziyad bin Sulayman.\nAmong them are the Abdalis, Banu Al-Jiyad bin Ziyad bin Sulayman.\nAmong them is Zubid bin Al-Khiyar, their number about three hundred; their master is Yahya Abu Al-Husayn Al-Zubaydi.\nFrom Banu Abdullah bin Al-Khiyar is Amr bin Yazid bin Abdullah bin Al-Jiyad. He led, but did not remain long in his leadership until he was stabbed in Banu Ghalib. The majority of Banu Al-Khiyar are in Hijaz due to events that occurred between them and Al-Rabi'ah and between Ziyad and Tawa'irat [?]. As for Banu Harb, they headed to Al-Arj. As for Banu Ghalib, they headed to Jabal Yasuma and Wadi Nakhlah.\nAl-Kala'i said: The reason for the relocation of Banu Harith bin Sa'd bin Khawlan is that they fought with their brothers Banu Rabi'ah bin Sa'd bin Khawlan, and killing increased between them in Sa'dah. So they moved to Hijaz, they and their brothers Banu Ghalib bin Sa'd bin Sa'd bin Khawlan in the year one hundred and thirty-one. Banu Ghalib settled in Al-Arj, and Banu Harith marched to the valleys of Marr, where there were Sulayman, Muzaynah, Anrah, Murrah, and Azim. Banu Harith drove them out and inhabited it. They had from the Caliph the money of Iraq brought to them repeatedly from the pilgrims, as well as authority over the Amir of the Two Sanctuaries towards it and Mount Arwan at the top of Arafat. Those who remained of Banu Harith and Banu Ghalib in the land of Khawlan stayed under the shadow and protection of Al-Harith bin Amr.\nFrom the descendants of Ghalib bin Sa'd bin Sa'd are Muqis, Khabir, and Sabil, three clans in Banu Hamrah, and Nasim bin Ghalib. And the Abdiyyun in Wadi Sarum (Sarum bin Sa'd).\nAbout them Amr bin Zaid Al-Ghalibi says:\n\"And I attributed their father to Sa'd...\nTo a lineage from the breach of Amrah piercing.\nMasters of Banu Jabr and Nasim are my brothers...\nAnd living Muqis from the offspring of Ghalib.\nAre not Banu Al-Sadat from the family of Ghalib...\nIf they detain high shoulders from it.\"\nAs for Rashwan bin Khawlan, he is the companion of Ghaylan. He had children: Harith, Lahiq, Mulhaq (with Sa'd), Munabbih, and Khawli.\nFrom the descendants of Khawli is Bint in Barsam. Most of these clans are in Tamim; they went out with Banu Haqq bin Khawlan in anger against Banu Khawlan. That is because Malik bin Amr, their master, when seditions stirred between Banu Hayy and Banu Sa'd, he squeezed them [?]. When the turn of fortune went against Banu Hayy, he said: \"I will not inhabit the land of Khawlan after my uncle Khalid bin Qais.\" The daughter of his uncle Khalid bin Qais was under him (his wife). Banu Mulhaq bin Rashwan went out to Anz bin Wa'il and attributed themselves among them.\nAs for Al-Azma' bin Khawlan, he is the owner of Hars. He had ten children, all with offspring: Marwan, Al-Karb, Al-Ashraf, Hasa, Amr, Abdullah, Tha'la, and Amira Al-Nasik. Those ignorant of the lineage of Banu Shihab in Kindah used to say: Shihab bin Al-Azma', making him the tenth child.\nFrom the descendants of Hasa Al-Azma' are Malik, Yashkur, Nur, Khalid Jawhar, Al-Karb, and Al-Ahwas on the weight of Al-Amluk.\nFrom Maran are Al-Ra'a, attributed as Ra'awi. To Maran are attributed Al-Qass Al-Maraniyyah. From them is the biggest estate of Khawlan. He had children: Hilal, Al-Ghala, Ali, Sa'd, and Jas'a. Harar begot Shurahbil, Jami', and Jabir. Lineage from Shurahbil is in Banu Nasr bin Jama'ah bin Shurahbil bin Hilal.\nAs for Al-Ghala, it is with Ghayn Mu'jamah. From his descendants are Hudhayfah, Habib, Walih, and Urayb.\nAs for Razih bin Khawlan, he had ten children: Mazid, Uwayd, Thaghla, Ibna, Bari, Nawa, Jadal, Nu'aym, Amr Yazid, and Hudayr. The family of Muslim bin Abbad bin Razih is more than a fifth of Khawlan.\nThey said: And Nu'aym is from the descendants of Al-Rabi'ah bin Sa'd, and entered into Razih, so they said Nu'aym bin Tha'lan bin Razih. Some Himyaris in Sa'dah informed me that Rabi'ah errs in the saying of Amr against Nu'aym that he is Ba'li [adopted?] and Nu'aym was undutiful to his father:\n\"We begot Nu'ayf so he came to a Ba'li...\nAnd Nu'aym was undutiful to his father the day he marched.\nHe followed his father the day he came to them...\nAnd became a delegate among them and confused.\"\nAs for Suhar bin Khawlan, there are seven children: Hadir, Yusr, Sabil, Tariq, Amir, and Alqamah. Hadir and Sa'd bin Hadir begot the Fatimids of the people of Al-Assah. Their maternal uncles are Banu Sa'd bin Sa'd bin Hadir and Hasbah from the time of Al-Mubayyad Ibrahim bin Musa Al-Alawi in the days of Al-Ma'mun. They were for a long time not known except as Banu Sa'd bin Sa'd until Ibn Attad Al-Akili said:\n\"If you are from Sa'd bin Sa'd correcting...\nThen I am to that birth confirming.\"\nAl-Abbasi Al-Issi said",

They are the most responsive of Khawlan and farthest in fame.\nFrom the ancient men of Banu Suhar is Alqamah bin Zaid; he was a traveler to kings in Yemen and Sham. And the family of Abi Qazimah who rose with Ibrahim bin Musa Al-Radi bin Ja'far bin Muhammad and ruined Sa'dah with him, and rose with those of Khawlan who rose against Muhammad bin Abbad and killed him. They went out with Yahya bin Al-Husayn bin Al-Qasim bin Ibrahim to Al-Rass.\nThe arrival of Al-Hadi Yahya bin Al-Husayn to Sa'dah was on the sixth of Safar year two hundred and eighty-four. There was a great sedition between Khawlan and Rabi'ah. He reconciled them, their word agreed, so they made him king over the land of Khawlan. They marched with him to Yemen until he possessed it. They were the pillar of his affair and the system of his state. They remained on that during the life of Yahya bin Al-Husayn Al-Hadi, the life of his son Muhammad bin Yahya, and the life of his daughter [son?] Al-Nasir bin Yahya.\nAs'ad bin Abi Ya'fur imprisoned Al-Hamdani. They asked him for him. He informed them that only As'ad imprisoned him for a crime against him. Al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Abi Al-Abbas rode to As'ad bin Abi Ya'fur and apologized to him, and said: \"Al-Nasir only wrote to me to imprison him for him, so ask him.\" They said: \"If he says yes, he writes to me so I release him.\" He left. The group of Al-Assa returned to Al-Nasir and informed him what As'ad said. He distanced them and was harsh to them, and [As'ad?] was harsh to him, and they showed dissent.\nAl-Hasan bin Abi Al-Abbas led a group for him and fought him at Madbaghah Kayfi. Al-Nasir asked Khawlan to leave and informed him that he had conquered [?]. He was satisfied and dismissed those crowds and returned from him until it was proven to him that the release of Al-Hamdani was from Ibn Ziyad, owner of Zubid.\nHe turned away from Al-Nasir and summoned Hassan bin Uthman bin Ahmad bin Ya'fur. Hassan was an enemy of Al-Nasir due to an offense he presented to him. Then Al-Nasir gathered against them [with] Gaza [raid?] from them. As'ad's condition tightened, and the group of men of Rabi'ah and most of Banu Sa'd and factions of Hamdan and many people of Sana'a separated. Their locations were grouped.\nZaid bin Abi Al-Abbas fought forty men from the children of Al-Asham. He attacked them and defeated them, reciting:\n\"The might of Al-Ahras has known...\nThat I am Zaid bin Abi Al-Abbas.\nI protect with my sword my harem and my head.\"\nHe was that day with a broken leg, bandaged with a turban, not riding except carried to [?]. Zaid bin Abi Al-Abbas was the Knight of the Arabs. He attacked with those with him and they defeated the Alawi. Those with him scattered, and he had the merit [length?], called the Attack of Zaid.\nThen Hassan bin Uthman bin Ya'fur marched to Al-Hawar. Between them was the Day of Al-Batin, one of the greatest days of the Arabs. Al-Husayn bin Yahya bin Al-Husayn, brother of Al-Nasir, was killed in it. Al-Nasir's heart split, he stayed ill for days, then died. They marched with Hassan to Sa'dah and he possessed it. Then Rabi'ah rose against him, and Zaid confronted it in the kingship of Arabs after stances that were not for anyone of the knights of the Arabs.\n\n(Section) Some genealogists of Khawlan said that he has children other than the mentioned nine: Abs, Wahim, Jabir, Simran, Hars, Al-Jundub, Al-Ukhdud, Baqir, and Hasan bin Abi Al-Haqq. Al-Karb is from Banu Hayy bin Khawlan. The clans of Al-Karb are Al Al-Jadi' and Al Halwan. What is correct is that Al-Karb is from the descendants of Al-Azma' bin Khawlan.\nAs for Abs bin Khawlan, his children are Amr, Nu'aym, Murrah, Ziyad, and Abd.

From Lawdh bin Sam and Aras bin Umeem bin Yalmah bin Abirwasin bin Amliq bin Abir bin Ashliha bin Lawdh bin Sam, also called Jurjan bin Umeem, according to Al-Kalbi: Tasam bin Abbarin Al-Saliha.

Regarding Ham, his descendants included Kush, Masrat, Thuban, Misr (Egypt), Safar, Kawthar, Al-Aziyah, Buya, Kurd, Bara, Rayh, Ra’awa, Hais, Tajah, and Maran. From Misr came the Copts and Sahalaba and Canaan, the sons of Misr bin Ham, giving Egypt its name. Among them were also Jalut bin Saklujim bin Misr bin Ham, as well as Andalusia and Sous from Sufar bin Mart bin Ham, Sind from Naufal Ham, India and Mazan from Kush.

It is narrated that Adam had forty sons in twenty tribes, with each tribe consisting of a man and a woman. Allah knows best and is Most Wise.\n\nYusuf bin Muhammad Al-Bakri, the scribe of this book, said: I have endeavored to accurately record the genealogies of tribes, the heads of families, branches, and clans, and have carefully reconciled differences to avoid errors, bias, and confusion. Whatever mistakes or oversights remain, we seek Allah’s refuge from them despite my diligence.\n\nThe copying of this book was completed on a Friday, the seventh of Rajab, year 627 AH, and further notes were added in 627 AH.
