    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nPraise be to Him who is unique in eternity, and singular in Lordship and Grandeur. Peace and blessings be upon our Master Muhammad, the Master of Prophets, and upon his pure family and pious companions.\nTo proceed, the daily events of Damascus of the Levant, most of which occurred during the days of the two great ministers: Sulayman Pasha and As'ad Pasha, who are among the notables of the ministers of Banu al-Azm the great. They were collected by the virtuous Shihab al-Din Ahmad bin Budayr al-Budayri, famous as the Barber (Al-Hallaq), from the year 1154 to the year 1176. It contained oddities, wonders, and terrors. Due to the simplicity of its author, he wrote it in colloquial language, then elaborated with additional events and rhymed supplications that bore the listener and weary the reader. So I removed the husk from these events and kept the core, and refined them as much as possible with correctness. To Him, the Exalted, is the return and destination, Amen.\n\nYear 1154\nAl-Budayri, may Allah have mercy on him, said meaning: In the year 1154, the governor of Damascus was Al-Hajj Ali Pasha, from the Turks. This was after eleven years had passed since the accession of our master Sultan Mahmud Khan son of Sultan Mustafa Khan, may Allah support the throne of this state until the end of time.\nIt circulated on the tongues of the common people that great earthquakes would occur in Damascus of the Levant, causing many places to collapse, and that men would turn into women, and that the rivers of Damascus would flow with food. They talked about many events like these superstitions and began circulating them among themselves, but nothing happened afterward in this year.\nThis year was a year of high prices in food and other things, until an ounce (uqiyya) of ghee reached five masari and a half, a rotl of rice sixteen masari, a mudd of barley eight masari, white bread twelve masari, a rotl of cakes (ka'k) fourteen masari, and brown bread a rotl for five masari.\nIn the previous year, the ruler of Damascus, Uthman Pasha the Collector (Al-Muhassil), expelled the Kapikulu regiment (Orta) from the Citadel of Damascus. He exiled some, killed some, and those who remained, he wrapped the turban cloth for them after a group of people testified that he was not a troublemaker (Zarbata) and no corruption occurred from him. He scattered their unity across all lands, and that was a reform. Evil was killed in Damascus of the Levant, and people's conditions improved.\nThe arrival of the Jukhadar from Hajj bringing good news was on the twenty-seventh day of the month of Muharram. The writers (Kattab) entered that year on the eve of Wednesday, the third night of the month of Safar. The writer was Bakir Basha al-Hamami accompanied by a group. The entry of the Hajj [caravan] into Damascus was on Saturday, the second day after the arrival of the writers. It continued to drag and withdraw for five days until the Mahmal entered. The pilgrims mentioned that they circled twice this year between the Two Holy Mosques, and they faced high prices and severe cold. Ibn Mudayyan, the Sheikh of the Arabs, was killed between the Two Holy Mosques after a fight broke out between them and the governor of Damascus, the Amir al-Hajj. Then he stayed for a while after his return from Hajj, and people were in safety and security, then he was dismissed.\nThe Sublime State appointed Sulayman Pasha ibn al-Azm over Damascus. Sulayman Pasha sent his Silahdar (armor-bearer), the husband of the daughter of Al-Wafa'i, as a deputy (Mutasallim) before entering Damascus. He remained for about two months without entering Damascus, then he came and camped at Al-Biqa' and wanted to besiege the Druze Mountain, but they reconciled with him for a large sum of money until they satisfied him. He entered Damascus on Thursday, the twelfth of Jumada al-Thani in this mentioned year, which is the year 1154. Three days after his entry, he crucified three wretches from the Arabs, and after that, he kept everything as it was and did not move a motionless object.\nThe year he entered was a manifestation of two of His Exalted Names: They are Qayyum (Self-Subsisting) and Hafiz (Preserver) for the year 1154. Sheikh Abd al-Rahman al-Bahlul, one of the writers of Damascus, organized it in a verse, saying:\nIn this year, He has manifested among them ... with the date Qayyum Hafiz (Self-Subsisting Preserver)\nIn this year, the fasting of Ramadan started on Friday, then it was proven at its end that the month started on Thursday. The Noble Mahmal left with the Pasha in the middle of Shawwal on Saturday. The next day, the Aleppo Hajj came, and with them were about three hundred Persians. After four days, the Hajj left, and a small group of pilgrims remained for the Defterdar of Sultan Mahmud Khan, so he left the next day, Thursday. The departure of the pilgrims was in Kanun al-Awwal (December), and the cold was extremely severe. Frost and ice remained on the ground for about twenty-five days, with the sun shining but the ice not melting, until it was said that nothing like it had been seen. Trees withered, and fruits were lost, especially lemons, citrons, and bitter oranges, until a rotl of charcoal was sold in Damascus for three masari. The Muzayribiyya reported after their return that charcoal was sold, every three rotls for a piastre (qirsh).",

    "text": "In this year, the Jarda (supply caravan) left on Saturday, the twenty-seventh of Dhu al-Qi'dah, and Ya'qub Pasha, the governor of Aleppo, was made Sardar (commander) over it. He was mentioned to have a pleasing biography and was just with the subjects.\nSheikh Ahmad al-Budayri said: I composed these Mawaliya (folk poetry) in this year, which is the year 1154, regarding those who spread lies and rumors that we mentioned earlier, where I said:\nFrom the abundance of lies of the Rafidites, gray hair crept into us ... They do not know that lying is a condition of shame.\nRegarding the earthquake, they spoke words of doubt ... The accursed ones began to know the Unseen.\nAnother:\nOn the eve of Saturday, the fifteenth of Muharram ... They leaned to the saying of the Rafidites, false and forbidden.\nRegarding the earthquake, sleep became forbidden ... Whoever slept under the roof, O brother, at night,\nSmelling the breeze between his sides became forbidden.\nAnother:\nO people, the lie of the Rafidites spread in the regions ... And made us women sitting in the middle of the house.\nMay the wrath of the One, Unique, Subduer descend upon them ... They terrified the creation about this earthquake, O people,\nThey are the donkeys of the Jews inside Saqar in the Fire.\nAnother:\nWith proof that the Rafidite on the Day of Gathering, O good people ... are donkeys to be ridden for the Khakhan and the Jawqar.\nThey intended a plot in Jillaq (Damascus) that pervaded the regions ... On the eve of Saturday, they said the earthquake would happen.\nDoes anyone know the Unseen except the One, the Subduer?\nAnother:\nOn the eve of Saturday, they said the earthquake would happen ... And the child is confused among people from its wonder.\nI ask You, O Lord, by the one who came as a bringer of glad tidings to mankind ... Wipe out the Rafidites of the people of Sham, O Worshipped One,\nAnd burn their fathers and sink their furnace and the well.\nPeople said a lie we had not heard ... The rivers of Sham, O brother, their water soaks,\nRunning with food instead of water in its course ... Fakhitiyya (dish) and yellow rice and fat meat,\nStand up and look at the Kibbeh and the ghee covered it.\nAnother:\nI heard one saying, O brother, your pipes ... are broken, let me stand with you to help you.\nBecause the fats of these types help you ... And you hide them for days of high prices and drought,\nDo not let the Kibbeh block it in its path from you.\nAnother:\nIn the year four with fifty, O masters ... I heard news I had not heard of as customs.\nThey increased in their extravagance, they did not hear the words ... All is for Allah and actions are by intentions.\nAnother:\nI seek forgiveness from Allah, my Lord, the Sender of provisions ... One, Guardian, you find it all absolute.\nAnd praise the Chosen One, he is the elite of the Creator ... He forgives you and with you Ahmad the Barber.\n\nYear 1155\nThen the year 1155 entered, and its first day was Thursday, which was the first of Muharram. After five days was the first of Adhar (March). In those days, a star appeared and began rising every night from the east from midnight until dawn, and it had a long tail, and it stayed for days then disappeared. Some composed a chronogram (history) containing the date for the entry of this year, which is:\nWe praise Allah who granted us ... A good year and endowed us with generosity.\nThis year has appeared, O people look ... The word of the date is an omen to be seized.\nSo supplicate to Allah for its completion ... with success, for you are the best of nations.\nAnd rejoice, O nation of the Guide who ... Allah singled out with favor and wisdom.\nMy Lord's favor encompassed us as an honor ... The thanks for those blessings cannot be counted.\nAnd likewise, all creation has been encompassed by ... His kindness, Glory be to Him, the Creator of souls.\nEspecially the band of Sham which ... is for the Abdal (substitutes/saints) a committed refuge.\nHow so, when the Masters have settled in it ... Their secret encompassed plain and hill.\nSo thank Allah for a year that has come ... The date showed preservation and blessings.\nThe entry of the Juqadar of Sulayman Pasha the Vizier, son of Al-Azm, in the year 1155 was on Saturday, falling on the twenty-fourth of the month of Muharram of the mentioned year. On Tuesday, the twenty-seventh of Muharram, the writers of the Noble Hajj approached. On the mentioned day, a strong wind blew for two days and two nights, uprooting many trees and demolishing countless places. A huge branch fell from the carob tree in the Hadra onto the head of an adolescent boy, killing him instantly, and two other men, crushing them, and the wind calmed down at its time.",

    "text": "On Monday, the third of Safar of the mentioned year, the Syrian Hajj entered Damascus, and Sulayman Pasha Al-Azm entered the next day. He was accompanied by Ya'qub Pasha, the Sardar of the Jarda, who was separated from Aleppo. The Hajj in that year was in safety, security, prosperity, and cheap prices, except that the Pasha went between the Two Holy Mosques from Quba and exited from Mount Arafat at the Dome of Light, and returned from the path that Ali Pasha came from.\nAl-Budayri said: In that year, the arrival of the decree confirming Sulayman Pasha Azm-Zade was delayed, so the riffraff and the lowly clamored in word and deed and displayed many innovations of pure prohibition, and they remained in those conditions until the decree arrived. Its entry was on the morning of the fourth of Jumada al-Thani of the mentioned year. The judge in Damascus was Abd al-Wahhab Effendi, nicknamed Aba-Zade.\nIn that year, Fathi Effendi ibn al-Qalanisi, the Defterdar, ordered the repair of the road to Salihiyya, so he turned over its tiles, built its platform, and improved his standing with the people.\nOn the first of the blessed Rajab of the year, which is the year 1155, a blessed maidservant came to us. We had bought a new house in the Ta'dil quarter, and we were in straitened circumstances, so we said: Perhaps by her arrival, victory and opening (Fatihah) will occur for us, so we named her Saliha (Righteous), may Allah Almighty make her Faliha (Successful).\nOn the 22nd of Jumada al-Thani, His Excellency Sulayman Pasha Al-Azm held a council (Diwan), and gathered in it the Effendis and Aghas, and issued a noble decree for justice and searching for corruptors in Damascus from the Janissaries. He summoned the heads of the Maydan, who are the Aghas, to attend, but they refused and sent to him asking what he wanted. He sent demanding from them sixteen men from the wretches whom they call in their terminology 'Zarbawat'. They sent to him saying: We cannot capture them, so you deal with them. Immediately, he removed their 'Kudkats' (titles/positions) from them and assigned them to others, and gave their names to the crier, and ordered him to call out in the streets of Damascus that the blood of these sixteen is shed with impunity, and there is no sin on whoever kills them, and others are in safety and security from Sulayman Pasha. All the people rejoiced because they were among the greatest corruptors.\nThe next day, the Dalatiyya killed a Janissary man, so people fled and Damascus closed down. The Pasha asked about that, and it was said to him that some Mosulis and Baghdadis who were Kapikulu and were expelled in the time of Uthman Pasha the Collector when they killed some Janissaries, now intend to cause sedition. So he ordered a crier to call out that after three days no one from the Mosulis, Baghdadis, and Kapikulu should remain, and whoever remains of them will be crucified and his property looted.\nOn the 24th of Jumada of this year, Judge Muhammad Effendi, nicknamed Findiq-Zade, entered and stayed in Salihiyya. The remaining term of the old judge was four [days/months?]. After completing them, the new judge commenced his function in the court.\nOn the evening of Tuesday, the third of Rajab of this year, Sulayman Pasha departed seeking to fight Zahir Umar, the ruler of Tiberias Fortress, accompanied by a great army, mostly Dalatiyya. He took with him bombs, miners (Laghumjiya), and gunners (Topciya) who came from Istanbul upon his request. Then he reached it and besieged it severely. His Excellency Sulayman Pasha sent asking the people of Damascus for ladders. They sent him what he requested. After a while, he sent asking for laborers and gardeners, accompanied by shovels, spades, and hoes, so all he requested was sent to him.\nHe continued besieging the fortress, striking it with cannons and bombs, but it did not affect it. The Druze, the people of Nablus, the deputy of Jerusalem Khalil Agha son of Abu Shanab, the Arabs of Bani Sakhr, and the Arabs of Al-Saqr with Qa'dan bin Zahir al-Salamah assisted him. They tightened the siege on the people of the fortress. However, some people of Tiberias reported that the besieged in the fortress did not suffer distress because their provisions were plentiful, and it was said that the fortress gate opened at a specific time, and some people would go to them and return with what they requested.\nA supply sent to them was seized. That is because the people of Deir Hanna, where Zahir Umar's brother was, sent a letter to his brother with a person, and sent a supply of gunpowder and other things with persons. A man from Sulayman Pasha's army captured the person with the letter. After searching him, the letter was found placed in his sandal. His Excellency the Pasha took the letter, read it, and interrogated him, and he confessed to the reinforcement and supply sent to Zahir Umar's brother. Immediately, Sulayman Pasha ordered his killing, and sent a group to the people who had the supply, so it was taken from them, and they killed most of them, cut off their heads, and Sulayman Pasha sent them to Istanbul. He tightened the siege and Sulayman Pasha sent to Zahir Umar's brother who was in Deir Hanna saying to him: When we finish with your brother, we will come to you, Allah willing. The completion of its conquest will come, Allah Almighty willing.",

    "text": "The crescent moon of Ramadan in this year was on Monday and was confirmed after Isha. Lamps were lit in all the minarets of Damascus, and cannons of confirmation were fired at midnight. People experienced crowding in the Suhur movement, so food shops like bakers and grocers opened at night.\nOn the ninth of the mentioned Ramadan, heavy rains fell on the entire country, praise be to Allah. A ship sank on the coast of Sidon during that period, coming from Egypt with many provisions; may Allah compensate its owners with good. It was said that it sank in the storm of Qasim Koy.\nThe Surra (purse/money sent to Mecca) came from Istanbul on Friday, and the Imperial Treasury came from Egypt on Saturday the thirteenth of Ramadan, having been delayed from its time. Its Sanjak (flag-bearer/commander) was Umar Bey. The Baltajiyya (axemen/guards) came from Istanbul on Monday in the mentioned month. Despite that, His Excellency Sulayman Pasha Al-Azm was besieging Tiberias, and had tightened on its people as will come.\nOn Tuesday the twenty-third of this month, the month of Ramadan, the righteous man Al-Hajj Ahmad Al-Hallaq bin Hashish passed away. He was a righteous man who saw wonders because he traveled a lot. He was good in companionship and affection, and was a barber for the unique of his time and pole of his era Sheikh Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, may his secret be sanctified. He also used to shave for Sheikh Murad Effendi al-Naqshbandi the Cripple, and for the pillar of the Shafi'i school our Sheikh Muhammad al-Ajluni and their likes. He used to shave for free for the poor students of knowledge and others. From his righteousness and piety is that he never placed his hand on a sick person with ophthalmia and read what was easy [from Quran] except that Allah healed him and cured him. Its historian, the barber Sheikh Ahmad al-Budayri, said: The subject of the biography was my master and teacher in the craft of barbering, and from him I received openings and blessings, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nThe next day, Wednesday, Sheikh Mustafa al-Mugharbil passed away. He was a religious man who took the Path from the Master Sheikh Yusuf al-Tabbakh.\nIn those times, high prices intensified in all things, especially foodstuffs, despite the existence of grains and other things. Due to the lack of inspection by the rulers, sellers sold at whatever [price] they wanted. However, sheep were very scarce, so butchers slaughtered buffaloes, camels, and goats. A rotl of Damascene meat was sold for thirty masari, a rotl of sheep tail fat for a piastre and a quarter, eggs two for a masriyyah, ghee a rotl and two ounces for a piastre, garlic a rotl for thirty masari, and a rotl of bread for four masari and five masari and more. It had been three masari and a half. With the arrival of the blessed month of Ramadan, prices rose, even vegetables. Before Ramadan, zucchini was a hundred for a masriyyah, but when Ramadan began, it became five and four for a masriyyah. Eggplant was two rotls for a masriyyah, then became every rotl for two masriyyahs. Meat was non-existent. All this was due to the lack of inspection by the rulers.\nThe day of Eid al-Fitr was Wednesday, and we fasted thirty days completing the number. Eid entered, and His Excellency the Governor of Damascus Sulayman Pasha did not come from the Dawra (tour), rather he is still residing at the siege of Tiberias Fortress.\nOn Saturday the fourth of Shawwal, an official announcement came from His Excellency Sulayman Pasha of the conquest of Tiberias Fortress. Cannons were fired, decorations were made, and drums and horns were played. The next day, Sunday, His Excellency Sulayman Pasha Al-Azm entered Damascus. His deputy (Kikhiya) and the army preceded him, and he left Ali Agha Ibn al-Tarjuman at Tiberias Fortress, with some soldiers and laborers, and ordered him not to come to Damascus until he destroys it after expelling its people from it.",

    "text": "The historian said: It reached me that the reason for its conquest was that when the siege intensified on its people, and provisions decreased among them, and they were unable to bring food due to the soldiers and Bedouins surrounding them, and that after striking with cannons and bombs, His Excellency Sulayman Pasha ordered digging trenches and a mine two hundred and eighty cubits long. When this reached them, the world narrowed upon them and their panic increased. Zahir Umar, the besieged Sheikh of Tiberias, sent to Umar Bey, the Sanjak of the Egyptian Treasury which comes to the Sublime State with ample appearance, to mediate peace between him and His Excellency Sulayman Pasha. This was before his arrival and the arrival of the Treasury to Damascus.\nWhen it arrived, Umar Bey marched and entered upon His Excellency Sulayman Pasha as a ruler in Egypt. Umar Bey was a dignified elderly man, and he said to him: O Excellency the Vizier, I am an elderly man in the position of your father, even if I am among your servants, and I enter upon your status for peace between you and the servant of your bounty and state Zahir Umar, Sheikh of Tiberias. Forgiveness is from the traits of the noble, and you are the noble, none other. His Excellency the Pasha answered him that it will be good, Allah Almighty willing.\nWhen it was the second day of Eid, Eid al-Fitr, the matter intensified on the people of Tiberias, and the siege increased on them. They went out to the top of the walls raising their voices calling His Excellency Ali Agha al-Tarjuman. When he approached them, they said to him: You have safety (Aman), enter the gate. So he took permission from the Pasha and entered the gate. His Excellency Sulayman Pasha had been overtaken by the travel to Hajj. So Ali Agha entered Tiberias Fortress and the Sheikhs met him, and with them Zahir Umar. They fell at his feet and began weeping around him, and prepared for him ten purses [of money], to intervene between them and His Excellency Sulayman Pasha for peace. Then the women, children, and elders came out weeping and wailing, so he felt pity for them, and marched seeking His Excellency the Pasha.\nWhen he reached him, he fell at his feet, and admonished him with clemency and compassion, and mentioned to him the virtues of good morals. So his heart softened and he answered his request. When the besieged knew and verified that His Excellency the Pasha pardoned them and forgave, the women, men, and children came out, with handkerchiefs around their necks and humiliation upon them, raising palms of supplication with submission, and clamoring with prayers for him and the Grand Sultan. They paid His Excellency two hundred and so purses of money after he took the son of Zahir Umar as a hostage and came to him to Damascus. He sent a group to demolish the fortress and annihilate it.\nThe historian said: Thus Ali Agha Shatir Bashi narrated this. It was reported to us in a different way. Allah knows best the reality of the situation.\nOn Friday, the tenth of Shawwal of this year, the noble descendant Sayyid Abdullah bin Ajlan, the Naqib (Head) of the Sadah Ashraf (Nobles/Descendants of the Prophet) in Damascus passed away. He was buried in their cemetery in the Sheep Market due to the narrowness of the Muradiyya Mosque. He was at that time removed from the NIqaba (position of Head), which was upon his nephew Sayyid Ali Effendi.\nOn that day, Sayyid Ali Effendi was removed from the Niqaba, and it was assigned to Sayyid Muhammad Effendi son of Sheikh Abd al-Qadir al-Gilani. On that day also, Hamid Effendi Ibn al-Imadi was removed from the position of Ifta (issuing fatwas) and it was assigned to his cousin Muhammad Effendi Ibn al-Imadi.\nThe historian, may Allah have mercy on him, said: On the eve of Saturday, the eleventh of Shawwal, my mother passed away in the first third of the night. May Allah have mercy on her, forgive her, and cool her resting place. She left the world while I was sleeping between her feet. She was among the devout worshipers, praying voluntary night prayers, and hadlitanies, to the end of what he said.\nIn that month of this year, after Friday prayer, the Noble Mahmal left with the perilous Vizier Sulayman Pasha bin al-Azm. The next day, Saturday, the Aleppo Hajj came, and with it were a thousand and seven hundred Persians. On the twentieth of Shawwal, the Hajj left the city little by little. Before the departure of Vizier Sulayman Pasha, he held a council and brought the notables, and showed the Firman (decree) which contained the killing of the Zarbawat, meaning the corruptors from the Janissaries. He said to those present: This decree whose command is delegated to us, we have cancelled it and pardoned them. This was counted among his good deeds.\nThe first day of the winter season in this year was from Wednesday the twenty-ninth of Shawwal, which is the day of the entry of the Muzayribiyya. The Pasha stayed in Muzayrib for four days and departed on the fifth day. The Arabs of Bani Sakhr carried the Hajj. Everything was cheap from all goods except Ma'muk, and barley was a mudd for half a piastre. Many servants returned. The sky rained heavily on the day the Muzayribiyya arrived after they had despaired, so all creation rejoiced and praised the Creator for His kindness.",

    "text": "On the tenth of Dhu al-Qi'dah, Mustafa Pasha, the governor of Tripoli of Syria, entered Damascus on Monday. The Sublime State appointed him Sardar over the Jarda. The aforementioned was a shedder of blood, unjust and tyrannical. He shed much blood when he was in Tripoli. Most of his killing was by dogs and hooks, leaving the man until he died of hunger and thirst. So most of the people of Tripoli fled from his injustice and scattered in the lands. He sent his aides in pursuit of the fugitives, and whoever they caught was among the perished.\nAfter his arrival in Damascus, a sedition occurred between the Dalatiyya belonging to the Mutasallim and the Levend Kurds. A group from both sides was killed. That sedition was on a Friday, so Friday prayer was cancelled in many mosques.\nOn the first of Dhu al-Hijjah, the end of the mentioned year, Sheikh Muhammad al-Kayyal passed away. He was one of the heads of muezzins in the Umayyad Mosque. He was a righteous man, and used to copy books and other things with an acceptable handwriting. He used to sleep with the pen in his hand, wake up, and write without looking at the writing. This was counted as a karamah (miracle) for him.\nOn that day, news came of the killing of the Mutasallim of Damascus. The Arabs of Zubaid killed him and killed a large group of his soldiers. That was because these Arabs were rebellious against the State. The mentioned Mutasallim went out with a group of soldiers, and they marched until they reached the mentioned Arabs. The Mutasallim and his soldiers surprised them while unaware with killing and other things, and wanted to take their wealth and livestock. So they retaliated against them with a jealous and patient response, killing the mentioned Mutasallim and a group of his soldiers.\nWhen this matter reached the dignitaries of Damascus, they held a council and then ordered a crier to call out: Whoever wants obedience to Allah and the Sultan, from those capable and strong to ride, let him not lag behind. So raid, raid against the Arabs of Zubaid who killed the Mutasallim and his soldiers. The Janissaries, Sipahis, and leaders went out. They appointed Hussein Agha bin al-Qutayfani, the administrator of the endowment of the late Sinan Pasha, as a deputy in Damascus. Then they marched to the Arabs, and returned with the body of the killed Mutasallim, which was in a state of lesson for those who take heed. Then they washed him in the government palace and buried him in Bab al-Saghir.\nHis name was Ibrahim, and he was a Mamluk of Sulayman Pasha bin al-Azm, the ruler of Damascus. Despite his master's justice, he had injustice, aggression, and audacity against the elite and commoners. He used to order the arrest of everyone he saw after Isha, and order him to be shackled immediately with iron, until he took much money from him. If someone committed a sin, and he could not capture him, he would capture whoever he could of his family and relatives, and force him to pay a large sum. If someone forbade him from those conditions, he would get angry and seek to depart. He continued in his injustice and arrogance until Allah took him.\nIt was said the reason for his destruction was that the Sheikh of Al-Jabla, Al-Fuhayli, came to him and said secretly: Rise so I can help you gain many spoils. No one from the grandees of Damascus knew, except his tyrannical people. So he and his people went until he reached Al-Lajat. When he reached that tribe, he drove their wealth and women. The Arabs turned back on him, and one of them took aim at him and hit him and did not miss, leaving him lying dead, and they killed a group of his people. That is for what his hands sent forth.\nOn Saturday, mid-Dhu al-Hijjah, our father, parent, teacher, and educator Sulayman bin al-Hashish the Hakawati (Storyteller) passed away, may Allah have mercy on him. He was unique in his age and singular in his time. He used to narrate the biography of Al-Zahir, Antara, and Sayf, and strange anecdotes in Turkish and Arabic, yet he was illiterate, neither reading nor writing. He was blond, leprous, intensely white, except that he was a vast ocean that could not be waded, may Allah have mercy on him.\nOn Saturday, the fifteenth of Dhu al-Hijjah, the late Abd al-Aziz Effendi al-Safarjalani passed away. He was a jurist who loved scholars, accepted by rulers, feared and dignified. He was given a status that no one from Banu al-Safarjalani attained, loving to do good, and for this, he gained acceptance among the elite and commoners.\nIn the early winter of the end of this year, rains were scarce, people despaired, and prices rose significantly. Then Allah aided His servants with rains like seas, and that was at the beginning of Kanun al-Thani (January). It continued night and day without slackening. The world snowed seven times, and that continued for forty-five days. Many places collapsed so that no place or direction remained in Damascus except that demolition occurred in it. Then after that, the sun rose, and Allah revived the earth after its death.\n\nYear 1156\nThen the year 1156, one thousand one hundred and fifty-six, entered on Monday, the first of Muharram. May Allah make it a year of good, mercy, and blessing. The governor in Damascus of the Levant was Sulayman Pasha al-Azm, who was in the caravan of the Noble Hajj.",

    "text": "This new year has begun, and a rotl of Damascene bread is at four or five masari, a rotl of rice at eight masari, a rotl of dibs (molasses) at eight masari, and an ounce of ghee at six masari and it is not found, although about a month ago every rotl and eight ounces was for a piastre. But the hoarder left no shirts for the poor. An ounce of honey at five masari, a rotl of lamb meat at thirty masari, a rotl of garlic at twelve masari, a rotl of buffalo meat and beef at twenty masari, and an ounce of oil at two masari and a piece. We have never heard of such high prices ever. The wait has prolonged, and people are waiting for relief from the King, the Exalted.\nThe historian said: At the beginning of this new year, the noble descendant Sayyid Ahmad al-Baba, head of the tanners' guild, passed away. He, may Allah have mercy on him, was of beautiful appearance and good prestige, and we had companionship with him.\nOn the twenty-fourth of Muharram, was the entry of the Jukhadar from the Noble Hajj, bringing news of safety and good conduct. Then the writer came with the letters on the twenty-eighth of Muharram, Sunday, of this mentioned year.\nAt the end of Muharram, a massive torrent occurred in Damascus, the like of which had never been seen since ancient times. Following it, large hail fell, continuing for two hours, until it rose on the surface of the earth about a cubit and a half.\nIn the beginning of the month of Safar al-Khayr, news came about the Noble Hajj that it drowned in Al-Hasa near Al-Qatranah. It was said that about half the Hajj was lost, of horses, camels, mules, women, men, wealth, and loads. One merchant lost seventeen loads, each load priceless. They appealed to His Excellency Sulayman Pasha al-Azm, Governor of Damascus and Amir al-Hajj, saying: We gift you our wealth, take it yourself and do not leave it to the Arabs. Immediately he rose, took a group with him, and went for about a stage. He risked himself and his group, then was absent for a day and a night after they searched for him earnestly. Suddenly he was coming with the loads, not a speck diminished. Then he called them and handed them to their owners, and his Hajj was not sullied by anything. They counted this feat for the likes of him, from high aspirations and lofty chivalry.\nUpon their arrival also at Al-Balqa, a great torrent also came, taking a huge amount of the Hajj, and wanted to finish off the rest of the Hajj, were it not that Allah rectified it with His kindness.\nWhen this matter happened, His Excellency Amir al-Hajj Sulayman Pasha wrote a signature (decree) and sent it to Damascus and those around it, to bring him fodder and supplies. The crier called out in the streets of Damascus: O nation of Muhammad, whoever loves Allah and His Messenger, and is able to go out, let him go out, with whatever food, drink, and clothing he can, let him go out to meet the pilgrims. So creation went out like locusts.\nOn Sunday, the fourth of Safar al-Khayr, the Hajj entered, and the next day the Noble Mahmal entered with His Excellency Sulayman Pasha. It was a terrible year. The pilgrims reported that a mudd of fodder became two piastres, and in some places four piastres, and every three dates for a masriyyah. This is something unheard of since ancient times. A heel of rusk was sold for a third of a piastre.\nDamascus was more expensive than others, until a mudd of salt reached thirty masari, dibs an ounce for a masriyyah, milk in Adhar a rotl for seven masari, bread was not found, and the rulers were hoarding, and the people of the city were doing as they did. To Allah is the destination.\nOn Monday, the thirteenth of Safar al-Khayr of this year, the working scholar Sheikh Amin Effendi Ibn al-Kharrat passed away, may Allah have mercy on him.\nOn the first of Rabi' al-Awwal of this year, His Excellency the Governor of Damascus, Sulayman Pasha Ibn al-Azm, began a celebration for the circumcision of his dear son Ahmad Bey. It was in the garden in the Amara district. He gathered in it all players, singers, Jews, and Christians. Notables and grandees of Effendis and Aghas gathered in it countlessly. He granted freedom for the players to play as they wished, of dancing, licentiousness, and other things. They continued in this state for seven days and nights. After that, he ordered decoration, so all the markets of Damascus were decorated for seven days, lighting candles and lamps, a decoration the like of which was not heard. He made a procession in which Aghas, Shurbajiyya, grandees, and Janissaries rode, and in it were strange games of representation of Arab braves and other things. The next day he circumcised his son Ahmad Bey, and ordered from his charity to circumcise whoever wanted from the children of the poor and others. So people started coming with their children, and whenever they circumcised a boy, they gave him a suit and two gold coins. He bestowed upon the elite and commoners, the poor and needy, food, clothing, and other things, such that no one had done some of what he did, nor did we hear of such generosity and favor upon the elite and commoners. May Allah have mercy on him and reward him with the best reward, Amen.",

    "text": "After this great celebration, Fathi Effendi the Defterdar held a great celebration in this month, I mean Rabi' al-Awwal, marrying his daughter to his brother. It was a great celebration whose equal was not done in Damascus, nor did anyone hear that the like was done. It was seven days; each day he dedicated to a group: The first day he dedicated to His Excellency the Governor of Damascus Sulayman Pasha bin al-Azm, the second day to the Mawali (judges) and Amirs, the third day to the Sheikhs and Scholars, the fourth day to Merchants and Tradesmen, the fifth day to Christians and Jews, the sixth day to Peasants, and the seventh day to Singers and Prostitutes, who are the daughters of sin and passion. He was exceedingly generous to them, giving them gold and silver without account. Before the celebration, he held a Tahlila (gathering for remembrance), gathering in it all the Sheikhs of the Tariqas (Sufi paths).\nOn the twenty-sixth of Rabi' al-Awwal in this year, the Naqib of Naqibs in Damascus, over crafts, industries, and paths, Sheikh Abd al-Rahman son of Sheikh Muhammad al-Hallaq al-Qadiri, holder of the circle in the Umayyad Mosque, passed away.\nOn Thursday, the twenty-eighth of Rabi' al-Thani in this mentioned year, the happy young man, descendant of the pure ones, and pride of the Siddiqis, Ahmad Effendi al-Bakri al-Siddiqi passed away. He was of great nobility and was buried in the tomb of Sheikh Arslan, may Allah have mercy on him.\nOn Sunday, the first of Jumada al-Ula of this year, His Excellency Sulayman Pasha Ibn al-Azm began constructing and restoring the Qanawat River, and made all expenses from his own money, may Allah reward him with good. Two hundred laborers worked on it. He ordered cutting some rocks from its path, reinforcing its corners, repairing what was corrupted of it, raising its walls, and controlling it well, and correcting the shares of its beneficiaries in the true manner, so that every right holder takes his right. This construction and control was such that no one preceded him to it since its repair in the days of Timur when it was repaired after him. His construction was completed in a period of fifteen days at the beginning of the forty days of summer (Marba'aniyyat al-Sayf). When it was completed, he ordered the release of the river, so its release for the people of Damascus was a sight of the most joyful sights, and a day like the Day of Crowding. The Sheikh of Literature in Damascus, Sheikh Abd al-Rahman al-Bahlul, dated this construction, praising His Excellency Vizier Sulayman Pasha and indicating the date of completing the building, saying:\nMay the Master reward the Emir of Damascus good ... Sulayman of the time and may he last forever.\nFor what he renewed of the Qanawat sincerely ... with sincerity that grew secretly and openly.\nSo blessed is he for attaining a reward ... over the passage of nights continuously.\nHe has in every honor hands ... with benevolence that rose and so forth.\nHow many faces of righteousness his hands made ... by it date: Sabil al-khayr ajra (The path of good flowed).\nOn Tuesday, the sixteenth of Jumada al-Ula, the Sheikh, the Jurist, the Scholar Sheikh Ali, teacher of Izz al-Din Mosque in Bab al-Sarija, passed away, approaching eighty, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nOn Saturday, the twenty-eighth of Jumada al-Ula of this year, the common people rose and attacked the court, expelled the judge, and looted the bakeries. The reason for that was the abundance of high prices, overcrowding at bakeries, and lack of inspection on the wheat owner, the miller, and the hoarder. His Excellency Governor Sulayman Pasha remedied this matter, sent intensifying [pressure] on the millers and bakers, threatening and frightening them. Immediately bread was found, improved, and became plentiful, after most people used to sleep without bread. So people implored with prayers for His Excellency.\nOn the sixth of Jumada al-Thani of this year, Sheikh Mustafa, son of our Sheikh and teacher, the Shafi'i of his time, and the virtuous of his era Sheikh Muhammad al-Ajluni, whom the Qanawat district was proud of, passed away, may Allah have mercy on him. By the decreed command, his wife died the first day, and he followed her the second day, may Allah Almighty have mercy on them both.",

    "text": "On the seventh of Jumada al-Thani of this year, Sulayman Pasha went out intending to fight Zahir Umar, the ruler of Tiberias Fortress. He took with him about five hundred men from the army, dressed them in Kalpaqs (caps). They resembled the Albanians (Arnaut) and he called them the Aranta. A decree came to him from the Sublime Porte that the governor of Sidon, the governor of Tripoli, Jerusalem, Gaza, Ramla, and Irbid should go out with him. It was said that twenty thousand from the Druze Mountain rode with him. On the tenth day, he sent to the Aghas of the Janissaries to send him three hundred Janissaries, and send the remaining soldiers to protect the villages of Hauran. He also sent to all the villages of Damascus to bring out ten individuals from each village, to protect with the Janissaries as well. Then he marched with those groups, and encamped at Marj al-Qadas (with Fatha on Qaf and Dal) in the land of the Matawila. He sent for Prince Mulhim, who came to him with two hundred horsemen.\nAfter a while, news came to Damascus that a fight occurred between the Druze and the Matawila. More than a thousand of the Matawila were killed, and the Druze burned their lands and looted their properties. Then the Matawila attacked the Druze and killed about five hundred men of the Druze. With them was Prince Haydar, owner of Deir al-Qamar Fortress. The Pasha forbade them, so they apologized to him, and he left them alone.\nThen His Excellency Sulayman Pasha departed seeking Deir Hanna Fortress, and took with him the Sheikh of the Matawila Nassar with about four hundred people. The Druze returned, and he did not accept their assistance. In Deir Hanna Fortress was Abu Sa'd, the brother of Zahir Umar.\nAl-Budayri said: In those days, news came to Damascus that the caravan which marched to Baghdad was taken by the Arabs. It contained wealth that cannot be counted by pen, including a ample gift from His Excellency Sulayman Pasha, Governor of Damascus, to Ahmad Pasha bin Hasan Pasha, Governor of Baghdad. Narrators reported that the Arabs who took the caravan were aides of the Kharijite who emerged from the land of Iraq, called Tahmasp, who overcame the King of Persia and took his land, and the King of India and took his land, and intended the city of Baghdad and besieged it most severely.\nOn the seventh day of Rajab, news came to Damascus that Sulayman Pasha Ibn al-Azm had died, and entered into the news of what was (i.e., became history). Immediately, Fathi Effendi bin al-Falaqinsi, Defterdar of Damascus, rose and sealed his houses, treasuries, and properties. He set a guard over that night and day, and confirmed Ali Agha the Mutasallim in his state, and wrote a petition about that and sent it to the Sublime State.\nOn the eve of Thursday, the eighth of Rajab of this year, at dawn time, they brought Sulayman Pasha in a litter, entered him into the Government Palace, washed him there, and buried him in the mid-morning in their cemetery in Bab al-Saghir, next to our master Bilal al-Habashi, in the grave where his son Ibrahim Bey is, by his will, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him broadly. He was a just, forbearing vizier, owner of good deeds and charities, loving scholars and people of righteousness. He abolished many injustices that were upon the people of Damascus, such as the Shashiyya, Mashyakha, and Ard, which are moneys imposed on crafts, industries, and neighborhoods in Damascus once or twice a year.",

    "text": "The historian Al-Budayri said: Someone I trust informed me about the cause of his death, which is that he entered the bath of Acre and came out feverish. Zahir Umar, the ruler of Tiberias, sent him a letter asking for peace, but he refused and said: It is not possible except with your head. So Zahir Umar sent seeking his help, saying: Take whatever money you wish, leave bloodshed and fighting, and have mercy on women and children. Sulayman Pasha did not accept until he entered the bath and came out feverish. He knew he was inevitably dying, then he willed to be carried to Damascus and buried next to his son. Then he passed away, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nThe Amirs concealed his death. The Alay Bey and the grandees of the state, the Kikhiya of Sulayman Pasha, departed from Acre, with the soldiers and cannons. They approached Tiberias, then fired cannons, and descended upon Tiberias, after placing the Pasha in the litter with the Jukhadariyya around him, and servants fanning him with fans right and left. They ordered the servants to call out among the soldiers as they passed: Allah grant you victory, O Abu Kharma, O Sulayman Pasha. Then he ordered the flags to be unfurled and the soldiers to line up and march. They passed Tiberias, and no one knew what happened.\nWhen they reached the Bridge of Jacob's Daughters (Jisr Banat Ya'qub), it reached them that five thousand of the Matawila were lying in ambush for them. So they departed at the beginning of the night and marched earnestly. The Kind One (Al-Latif) was kind, and they reached Damascus at dawn. The day of their entry, the Janissaries rose and killed a group of Dalatiyya aggressively without cause.\nAs for Fathi Chalabi the Defterdar, he ordered the imprisonment of the Silahdar, Khazindar, Sayyid Muhammad Bey, cousin of Sulayman Pasha, and Muhammad Agha al-Dayri, the Wakeel al-Kharj (Expense Agent) and controller in Damascus. Their imprisonment was in Bab al-Agha, and he put under surveillance those with them of the group, and waited for the answer.\nOn Wednesday, the fourteenth of the month of Sha'ban of this year, news arrived that As'ad Pasha bin al-Azm, the ruler in Hama, had been confirmed for the Wilaya (governorate) of Damascus along with the Emirate of Hajj. So they kept its Mutasallim Ali Agha mentioned before until the arrival of the mentioned Pasha.\nOn that day, three messengers came from the Noble Medina, upon its dweller be the best prayers and perfect peace. They reported that Medina was besieged and that it was three alliances: an alliance with the Castle of Gaza, an alliance with the Tawashi (Eunuch/Guard), and an alliance with the people of Medina, and that they were in great distress. The Sharif of Mecca sent fifteen banners to the Tawashi to help him in that, and that the mentioned messengers were heading to Istanbul to inform His Excellency the Sultan of that situation.\nOn Saturday, the twenty-fifth of blessed Sha'ban falling in the year 1156, was the entry of As'ad Pasha Ibn al-Azm to Damascus as governor. His entry was from Masjid al-Aqsab, which is the neighborhood known among the people of Damascus as Mazz al-Qasab. He entered with a great procession of Janissaries and the grandees, princes, and notables of Damascus.\nOn the eve of Saturday, the Judge of Damascus ruled establishing the crescent of Ramadan. Cannons were fired shortly before Isha, and Tarawih was prayed in the Umayyad Mosque and all other mosques.\nOn the eve of Thursday, the fifth of the mentioned Ramadan, As'ad Pasha traveled with his army on the Dawra (tour), and left Ali Agha mentioned before as Mutasallim over the city. His departure was in moderate weather, and the city was in safety and much good. A rotl of bread was five masari, an ounce of ghee six masari, a rotl of rice nine masari, a rotl of meat eighteen masari, and a ghirara of wheat twenty-five piastres. The high prices were at this level, and there was no drought, locusts, or lack of rain, but from lack of inspection and attention.\nHis Excellency As'ad Pasha traveled and kept the aforementioned Mutasallim, and left everything as it was. Fathi Effendi the Defterdar mediated peace between Zahir Umar, the ruler of Tiberias, and His Excellency As'ad Pasha. So Zahir Umar sent him forty loads loaded with rice, sugar, and cloth. This is besides what Fathi the Defterdar appropriated for himself, for he was the Sultan in Damascus, possessor of effective speech, his word dictated affairs, while the command is delegated to the Possessor of Majesty.\nIn those days, news arrived that the Kharijite named Tahmasp arrived in the land of Iraq, took the city of Kirkuk, and is besieging Mosul and Baghdad, and has sold women and children. We ask Allah Almighty for kindness to the servants.",

    "text": "In those days, the Ifta (position of Mufti) returned to Hamid Effendi Ibn al-Imadi. On the eve of Saturday, the moon eclipsed after midnight, a severe eclipse, and remained until the day broke.\nOn the fourteenth of the month of Ramadan of this year, a man threw himself from the top of the minaret of Al-Daqqaq Mosque to the ground; he perished quickly after his body broke. His name was Sheikh Hasan bin Sheikh Yusuf al-Rifa'i. We asked about the reason for that, and we were told that his wife's brother brought a woman to his house, and she was of the sinners. He forbade him from that, so he scolded and hit him. He went and informed the elders of the neighborhood, but they paid no attention to him because they were immersed in worse than that. So he went to Al-Daqqaq Mosque, prayed Fajr with the Imam, prayed the prayer of death upon himself, climbed the minaret and called out: O Nation of Islam, death is easier than pimping with the state of these days. Then he threw himself to the ground. May Allah forgive him.\nOn the eighteenth of this month, Ramadan, a man called Al-Majra put a pistol to his stomach and killed himself. We asked about the reason for that, and we were told this is a man in debt, so he killed himself due to the severity of his distress and oppression, although they told us they found with him about five sacks of stored wheat, so his soul did not allow him to sell any of it and pay his debt, so he lost his religion and worldly life.\nOn Tuesday, the twenty-fifth of Ramadan in this year, the people of Damascus closed their shops, and the Ashraf rose against the house of Fathi Effendi the Defterdar. The reason for that was that a follower of Fathi Effendi, called Al-Afsa, cursed Sayyid Ali Effendi the Naqib, and drew a weapon on him and on Sayyid Ali Effendi son of Sheikh Murad the Cripple in the Umayyad Mosque. The notables gathered, held a council, and issued a fatwa to kill him and spill his blood with impunity. A search for him ensued, so he hid in the house of Mustafa Agha bin Khudari the Shurbaji in the Maydan. This Al-Afsa shot at Sayyid Ali Effendi al-Muradi while he was entering his house but did not hit him. The city was disturbed, and the grandees, Aghas, Kapici, Baltajiyya, and Amin al-Surra gathered at the Judge's in the court. They made a petition against Fathi Effendi the Defterdar, that he is among the greatest corruptors, he and his followers, and wanted to send it to the Sublime State, but they waited for the arrival of His Excellency As'ad Pasha from the Dawra to seal it. The next day, their zeal became void, and their speech was as said: The speech of the night is erased by the day.\nOn the eve of Friday, the twenty-eighth of Ramadan, a slaughtered beggar was found in the Umayyad Mosque, at Bab al-Kallasa, with scattered flus (coins) on his chest. His adversary did not appear. It was said they thought they were gold, so they slaughtered him for that, and when they found them to be flus, they scattered them on him after killing him.\nOn Thursday, the fourth of Shawwal, As'ad Pasha arrived from the Dawra. On the ninth of Shawwal, Ali Agha Ibn al-Tarjuman passed away. He was a man whose praise among people was beautiful. Two days before, As'ad Pasha held a council and gathered the grandees and notables, and priced wheat and bread, making a ghirara of wheat twenty-five piastres, and a rotl of bread five masari. This matter of pricing does not hold straight, especially in Damascus.\nOn Monday, the fifteenth of Shawwal, As'ad Pasha departed as Amir al-Hajj with the Noble Mahmal, heading to Honorable Mecca. On Saturday the twentieth of Shawwal, the Noble Hajj departed. The season was winter, the sky was clear, and there was high prices and some plague. After the Pasha's travel, a rotl of bread remained at five masari, but a ghirara of wheat became thirty piastres. Then the common people clamored and stoned the judge, but it availed nothing.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: On that day, our teacher, the Sheikh of the reciters of Damascus, Sheikh Ibrahim al-Hafiz, about whom the master of Damascus Sheikh Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi said: Whoever wants to hear the Quran as it was revealed, let him hear it from the mouth of Sheikh Ibrahim al-Nabulsi, benefited us by reading this blessed supplication, and its property against the attack of fears in travel and residence. It is this supplication: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful. In the name of Allah the Creator, the Greatest Bestower, a protection for every fearful one, there is no power for a creature with Allah Almighty. O Allah, I am in Your protection and under Your banner, so have mercy on Your protection and spread Your banner over us and uncover from us Your trial coming from Your earth and descending from Your sky... [words unclear] If they turn away, say: Sufficient for me is Allah; there is no deity except Him. On Him I have relied, and He is the Lord of the Great Throne.",

He was the preacher and Imam in Al-Daqqaq Mosque in the Qubaybat district south of Damascus, which is the Lower Maydan at Bab Allah. The historian said: That district is my birthplace and where my head fell, and our home is in it. After our father's death, we moved from it to the Ta'dil district. The mentioned Sheikh Ahmad was a virtuous man; he revived that district with sciences and religion, and many Muslims benefited from him.\nOn the twenty-third of Shawwal of this year, a Silahshor arrived from the Sultan to collect Sulayman Pasha's money, amounting to twelve thousand purses. He entered Damascus like a flare of fire, and expelled Sulayman Pasha's harem from their homes atrociously. They began searching them one by one, searching their pockets and bosoms. He sealed all the rooms of the house, ordered the arrest of the late Sulayman Pasha's cousin, Sayyid Muhammad, and a group with him, and ordered strict surveillance over them. He asked about Muhammad Agha al-Dayri, Sulayman Pasha's expense agent, and they told him he went with As'ad Pasha to Hajj, so he ordered him to be brought. They brought him, and he ordered him to be put under surveillance.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: Then the Silahshor summoned the judge and notables, brought Sulayman Pasha's harem, brought the executioner and torture instruments, and intensified the demand on the harem to inform him about where the money was hidden. When they saw the severity, they feared torture and confessed to him about some hiding places underground. He sent for the builders who built the Saraya, who were Christians, and the master was a Christian called Ibn Sayyaj. The Kapici ordered torturing them, cutting off their heads and hands. When they realized their torture, they said: We will show you everything that was done. Then they dug for him under the stairs, revealing a cellar. They removed the dirt from it, went down stairs, and a wide place appeared containing a locked chest with locks. They took it out and opened it, and saw it full of dirhams and riyals. Then the Christian took them out to a room, dug in its circles, and behold, there were seven jars full of Sultanic gold coins (Mahbub). When those present saw that state, their eyes deviated. Then they counted and recorded it, finding it to be eight hundred and fifty purses.\nWhen people learned what came out of this money, and it was during days of severe high prices and bad conditions, they spoke with blame and punishment, saying he starved women, men, animals, and children until he collected this money from family owners, and did not observe Allah, the Possessor of Majesty.\nPreviously, a Kapici came to seize Sulayman Pasha's money, and seized two thousand and fifty purses, so he did not see it as anything. Fathi Effendi the Defterdar had bought most of his belongings and grains. He had wheat whose price reached twenty-five purses, reaching twenty-five piastres per ghirara, and the purse is five hundred piastres. Look how many ghiraras for twenty-five purses. There is no power or strength except with Allah.\nTalk will come about Allah's seizure and anger with the mentioned Defterdar, because Allah Almighty delays but does not neglect. And do not think Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do.\nOn the twenty-fourth day, Saturday of the month of Dhu al-Qi'dah, Sheikh Muhammad al-Maktabi and his son passed away in the plague intensifying in these times. He was an Imam in the Qal'i Mosque and a Kuttab teacher in the Kharratin district. He died at the beginning of the day, and his son at its end.\nThe beginning of this plague was early autumn, in late summer, and it continued until winter entered and increased greatly. It was said that with the entry of the new year it would go.\nIn early Dhu al-Hijjah, a star with a tail rose from the west, continuing until shortly after winter, and persisted until the new year entered.\n\nYear 1157\nIts entry was the first of Muharram al-Haram, Saturday, the year one thousand one hundred and fifty-seven, 1157. The star with a tail continued to rise from the west, then began rising from the east with its tail to the west.",

    "text": "In those days, the Sheikh of the Takiyya killed himself. In that year, prostitutes multiplied, displaying themselves day and night. One night, the Judge of Damascus went out after Asr to Salihiyya, and encountered a woman from the prostitutes named Salamun, behaving riotously in the road, drunk and with uncovered face, holding a knife. The Judge's group shouted at her to move out of the way, the Judge is coming. She laughed, shouted, and attacked the Judge with the knife. His aides pushed her away from him. Then the Judge gathered the Governor and the Mutasallim, and mentioned to him what happened with this whore. They told him this is a prostitute named Salamun, and most people are infatuated with her, such that every need or item is attributed to her, saying: this is Salamuni goods, this is a Salamuni dress. The Mufti issued a fatwa to kill her and shed her blood with impunity to quell the sedition. They searched for her and killed her. They sent a crier to call in the city that whoever sees a girl of error and passion (prostitute) should kill her and her blood is shed with impunity. So a number of them traveled and the rest hid. Despite that, the plague was camped in Damascus and its suburbs, with high prices and stagnation of prices.\nOn Wednesday, the nineteenth of Muharram of this year, a noble decree arrived from the Sublime State to the Kapici who came to seize Sulayman Pasha's money, to gather the city's notables and read the Firman to them. Its content was to search and inspect the remnants of the mentioned Pasha, and to torture men and women without opposition until they confess about the money. They answered with hearing and obedience. The first one he brought was the Pasha's cousin Sayyid Muhammad and threatened him. He swore by divorce that he had no knowledge. It was said he beat him, so he confessed to a place and said dig here. They dug in the Pasha's house around the fireplace. They found four jars of gold, containing sixteen thousand gold pieces.\nThen they beat the Tawashi (Eunuch), so he confessed that a nosebag full of riyals was deposited with a man called Hasan al-Tarabulsi. The notables went to him and brought him and the money. They took it out and found inside the nosebag among the money a jewel with no value, and saw the money less than what the Tawashi said. The Kapici ordered the imprisonment of the one from whom the money came, and imprisonment of his children and those related to him. He ordered the presence of the Pasha's women and harem. We mentioned first that he expelled them from the house by force and left them under surveillance. Now he ordered bringing them, so they brought them and he interrogated them, but they denied. So he ordered their imprisonment, and they were imprisoned in Bab al-Barid and it was tightened on them.\nSulayman Pasha had a concubine preferred over all his favorites named Zahra, like the full moon in the horizon of the sky. The Kapici had left her with Sulayman Bey, Sulayman Pasha's agent over his properties, under surveillance. When the decree came to him to punish men and women, he ordered her brought, and asked her about the money. She denied and claimed she saw nothing and knew nothing. He ordered beating her, so she was beaten on her face, hands, and sides until she lost her senses, yet she confessed nothing, swearing she had no knowledge or news and her master Sulayman Pasha did not inform her of anything. He left her under surveillance, because he is a mean tyrant and accursed devil with no compassion for the harem; may Allah punish him with the fire of Hell, on a Day when neither wealth nor children will benefit, except him who comes to Allah with a sound heart.\nThen after that, the Kapici gathered all the Pasha's harem, slaves and free women, all at once, and took all they had of gold, silver, goods, jewelry, clothes, and everything women possess, after torture, humiliation, and severe beating. May Allah fight him with skins having no tanner and punish him with the fire of eternity.\nThen Sulayman Pasha had a wife who was the daughter of Sheikh Yasin al-Qadiri. When she saw what befell her companions of humiliation, the Kapici asked her about her husband the Pasha's money and threatened her with torture. She feared and gave him a form of gold worth ten purses, and gave him Tamassukat (bonds), which are documents against some merchants for about one hundred and fifty purses. All that money was inheritance from her father Sheikh Yasin al-Qadiri, may Allah have mercy on him and sanctify his secret.\nAll this situation while As'ad Pasha al-Azm was in Hajj. When As'ad Pasha came from Hajj, he held a council, and the Kapici attended and produced a noble decree that his command is delegated to do what he wishes of torture, killing, and imprisonment, and no one opposes him. People thought that As'ad Pasha would rise and sit for that [in anger], but the matter turned out otherwise, and he stood and did not move a motionless object. Taking Sulayman's revenge from Fathi Effendi the Defterdar will come soon. Then after a while, a decree of pardon (Afu Nameh) came. They gathered Muhammad Agha Ibn al-Dayri, Sayyid Muhammad cousin of Sulayman Pasha, and Sayyid Sulayman. They sold the wheat, properties, and what remained of goods and armory to As'ad Pasha for four hundred purses.",

    "text": "On Thursday, the fifth of Jumada al-Ula, the mentioned Kapici traveled to Istanbul. People thought that As'ad Pasha, nephew of Sulayman Pasha, would do something to the Kapici and Fathi the Defterdar, but nothing occurred from him. His planning for the destruction of the Defterdar will come soon.\nAt the end of Jumada al-Thani, news came from the Sublime State summoning Fathi Effendi the Defterdar. He went accompanied by the Kapici who came to summon him.\nOn the fifth day of Rajab, the notables of Damascus banded together and made a petition against Fathi Effendi stating that he is one of the corruptors. The matter was not completed with them due to the difference in their word.\nOn the eve of the twenty-third of Rajab, after Isha, the sky split and a great calamity descended from it, and this became famous among the people. The historian said: I did not see it with my own eyes.\nOn the eighth day of Sha'ban, the Judge of Damascus Muhammad Effendi Zade entered. He was a rational man, except that he had no politics or management.\nOn the fourteenth day of the month of Ramadan in this year, Fathi Effendi the Defterdar came from Istanbul and entered Damascus with joy and happiness, and no harm touched him. The reason for that was what he spent in Istanbul of money that sways the hearts of men. He was counted on the Kizlar (Agha) and a group of senior state leaders. It was said that he entered Istanbul secretly and distributed money secretly and openly. The Sultan had summoned him, so they dressed a man in his outfit and brought him into the King. He reprimanded him with words and for what occurred from him, and the complaints sent by the people of Damascus against him. Every time His Excellency King Mahmud Khan said a word to him, he would signal with his head 'yes'. The one who brought him in had ordered him to do so. Immediately he ordered his killing, so he was killed, while he thought it was Fathi Effendi the Defterdar. Then they ordered Fathi to reach Damascus at night.\nAt the end of Dhu al-Hijjah, the flus (copper coins) which were struck in Damascus were invalidated.\n\nYear 1158\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and fifty-eight entered on Tuesday.\nThe matter of the Zarbawat, the wretches, transgressing aggravated. They went to extremes in cursing religion, oppressing people, and other things. The ruler of Damascus, His Excellency As'ad Pasha, did not move a motionless object, and did nothing, until they began calling him Sa'diyya Qadin (Lady Sa'diyya), sleeping with the sleepers, while we see wretches making honor and wealth permissible. However, the city was calm from movements and safe from the oppression of rulers.\nOn the fifteenth of Jumada al-Thani, the virtuous Sheikh, the belief of the people of Damascus absolutely, Sheikh Yusuf al-Tabbakh al-Khalwati passed away. The historian said: Among what Allah bestowed upon me is that I shaved his head and seized the opportunity of his supplication, may Allah have mercy on him and be pleased with him.\nOn Monday, the twenty-first of Jumada al-Thani of this year, the common people rose due to lack of bread and high prices and attacked the Saraya, raising their voices with weeping and supplication, saying: Lack of compassion for the servants who were harmed by high prices is not lawful by Allah, and you are the ruler of Damascus and responsible before Allah for us and these conditions. As'ad Pasha said to them: Go to the court and complain about your condition to the Judge. So they approached towards the court, and screamed in it complaining of their condition, what befell them, and what is happening to them. The Judge's group came out with sticks and expelled them, and that was by the order of his deputy. The common people attacked and stoned them. The Judge ordered his aides to shoot with gunpowder, so they shot them, killing a noble man (Sharif) among them and wounding a group. The common people raided them, and some Janissaries helped them. They defeated the Judge, killed the Bash Jukhadar and some of his aides, looted the court and burned its door. People closed the city. Some Aghas rode and turned the people back. As for the Judge, he fled over the roofs, he and his deputy and group. Some grandees took him and consoled him. The Judge swore not to live this month except in the Citadel. Then they gathered the Judge's money and goods, and what was missing they imposed on the treasury of the regiment (Ojak) and on some grandees and notables. They pleased the Judge, reconciled him, and returned him to the court.\nOn the day of the twenty-eighth of Jumada al-Thani, the ascetic Sheikh, possessor of states and miracles, Sheikh Ahmad al-Nahlawi al-Ahmadi passed away, and was buried in his Zawiya where he resided next to Sitti Khatun Shah sister of the Just King Sultan Nur al-Din, famous as the Court Alley.",

    "text": "Then in these times, the cost of prices increased, rains decreased, and the affairs of fools and evildoers became great, until a rotl of cheese became half a piastre, an egg a masriyyah, an ounce of sesame oil (siraj) half a third, a mudd of barley half a piastre, a mudd of chickpeas half a piastre, a mudd of lentils half a piastre, a ghirara of wheat forty-five piastres after it was twenty-five piastres, an ounce of tahini four masari, dibs every three rotls a piastre, a rotl of honey a piastre and a quarter, and everything's price rose above custom, until a mudd of salt became half a piastre.\nIn those days, Mustafa Agha Ibn al-Qabbani, the Kikhiya of the Janissaries, perished from a disease that doctors were unable to cure. He was among those who hoarded food and wished high prices for Allah's creation, so Allah made punishment and retribution. It reached me about him that when they wanted to bury him, they dug a grave for him and found a huge snake in it, so they dug another and found likewise, until they dug several graves finding the snake. I said: This has preceded in the past for some oppressors. They found in his estate one hundred ghiraras of sesame, while in the whole city not a mudd of sesame was found. They found much wheat. He was asked to sell a ghirara of wheat for forty-five piastres but he refused, and swore not to sell it except for fifty. So he perished and sold nothing, and it was sold in his estate. Allah showed mercy to His servants by his death because He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.\n\nYear 1159\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and fifty-nine entered, and its first day was Sunday. Its judge Mustafa Effendi entered, preceded by his aides carrying guns and weapons, until he reached the court. This did not happen to anyone else. Then he sat in the court not moving a motionless object, may Allah grant him success. The ruler in Damascus and the Wali there was His Excellency the Perilous Vizier As'ad Pasha Ibn al-Azm, may Allah support him and strengthen his word. He was absent in Hajj, and the Mutasallim and Kikhiya was Musa. But high prices were standing on foot and leg (rampant) along with distress, fear, and discord.\nOn the third of Safar, the Hajj entered Damascus on Thursday accompanied by its Great Amir and Magnified Vizier His Excellency Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha al-Azm. He and the pilgrims were in utmost health and safety. Then after that, he sent demanding the Dalatiyya urgently. When the Janissaries saw that, the earth narrowed upon them, and they said like their previous sayings in lack of manners: Lady Sa'diyya wants to betray us, and this matter does not scare us. Then they increased in carrying weapons, looting money, violating honor, cursing religion, and other atrocities.\nWhen they increased in arrogance and lethality, and did not observe the Presence of the Truth, Exalted is His Majesty, Allah Almighty sent from His anger a severe wind upon Damascus the like of which had not been seen in past days. It uprooted trees from their roots and threw down most walls, until people thought the Resurrection had risen.",

    "text": "On Monday, the twenty-second of Safar of this mentioned year, while people were at their work before noon, suddenly there was a great noise and gunfire. It was asked: What is the news? It was said: The Dalatiyya took possession of the Citadel. The city closed down and panic increased in everyone. When the news reached the Janissaries, they rose on foot and leg. They said: The Citadel has been taken from us, O youth. They gathered at Bab al-Jabiya with full weapons waiting for the fight.\nWhen the news reached His Excellency As'ad Pasha, he rejoiced and was happy, and called out: Seek Suq Saruja and be diligent in the pursuit. He ordered them to leave the Qibla side, and that was a trick and deception from him. Then he called out among his soldiers a call that spread in the city that Murad Ahmad bin al-Qaltaqji and Abdullah bin Hamza and their followers [were targets]. They were among the leaders and princes of Suq Saruja. The music/dancers (Jank) were playing in Suq Saruja, as if there was no ruler in Damascus but them, so Allah wanted their destruction.\nThen His Excellency the Pasha ordered cannons to be directed at Suq Saruja. They directed what they had and he ordered striking it with balls, so it was struck. In less than a short while, houses burned, homes were demolished, Al-Qaltaqji's house burned and was annihilated to the last, and soldiers looted everything in it. Then looting spread to the rest of the houses. They looted, killed, mutilated, and innovated [in torture]. The good and bad went, until the Suq Saruja district became a barren plain. As for Ibn al-Qaltaqji, he fled escaping after he and his group exerted the utmost bravery.\nThen His Excellency the Pasha ordered cannons to be turned towards Al-Maydan, so they directed them. The head of the corruptors there was Mustafa Agha bin Khudari Jurbaji, to the point he named himself Sultan of Damascus, and he had a gang of wretches strengthening him. Also there were the sons of Al-Darzi, Ahmad Agha and Khalil Agha, and they had power and authority there. When it reached these corruptors that His Excellency As'ad Pasha directed cannons with soldiers against them, Allah cast terror into their hearts, and they resorted to escape and flight, seeking deserts and wastelands. With their defeat and flight, the hearts of the remaining brave ones of Al-Maydan broke. Some fled and joined their masters, some were buried in caves and graves, and some dived into rivers.\nWhen the cannons reached Al-Maydan, they found no one defending. The first thing soldiers busied themselves with was demolishing the house of Ibn Khudari, after looting all goods and other things in it. They did likewise to the house of Ibn Hamza and other houses, until they looted about five hundred houses. After that, they busied themselves with demolishing the houses they looted.\nHis Excellency As'ad Pasha, may Allah make him happy and strengthen him, sent news to the Sheikhs of the neighborhoods there and their Imams to arrest the remaining wretches present, and if they did not, he would fine them with huge sums of money. So they began tracking the wretches one by one, saying to His Excellency the Pasha: This wretch is so-and-so, and this Agha is so-and-so, and this Shurbaji is so-and-so. His Excellency the Pasha would order beheading them in front of the Saraya gate and leaving their bodies for dogs to eat for a long time, until they became a lesson for those who take heed. Then Damascus calmed down after that, and became like a cup of milk. People became safe and secure, and honors were protected. The Pasha possessed the city with about four hundred Dalatiyya soldiers. The wilderness became safe. That was by his strong determination after the leaders of Al-Maydan and their aides used to say: If ten Pashas came to us, including the Sultan, we would not account for them, and we would shred their tails with pistols. Look now, they have become more humiliated than flies and food for the vilest dogs.\nAs for the sons of Ibn al-Darzi, they fled and took refuge with the Arabs of Ibn Kulayb, they and their followers. As for Ibn Hamza and his followers, they fled towards Tiberias and took refuge with Zahir Umar. The sons of Al-Qaltaqji and their followers fled to the Druze Mountain. Whoever of them fell, they made his skin into patches. The greatest calamity and disappointment was for the house of Hasan Turkman; five men were killed from them: Hamza Bey, Muhammad Agha, Hasan Agha, Khalil Agha, and their groom. They were among the corruptors, oppressors, harmers, violators of harems, cursers of religion, except Hamza Bey, for he was contrary to that; he went by mistake and in vain.\nThe city was decorated, cannons fired morning and evening for two months, and the nauba (music) with fireworks. Allah sufficed the believers in fighting, and the remnant of the people who wronged were cut off. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: I said describing them in Mawaliya:\nWhere is the slippery shoe (Zallaqa) that was like a sword ... Boots they don't take off in winter or summer.\nIf one sees his friend he doesn't say how are you ... That Zallaqa has passed, oh alas, oh alas.",

    "text": "At the end of Rabi' al-Thani, His Excellency As'ad Pasha al-Azm sent a huge army to the city of Baalbek to kill its governor, Emir Hussein. They found no trace of him. The aides entered, looted, robbed, and did what they did. Then they brought eight men from the notables of Baalbek, including its Mufti, to Damascus. Its mentioned Mufti was hanged, and the rest were beheaded.\nIn those days, His Excellency As'ad Pasha sent a number of troops to the Arabs. They returned with heads of Arabs, camels, sheep, loot, and other things. His Excellency As'ad Pasha mentioned terrified the great and small, and his reputation became great even in the deserts and wastelands. They began adding 'Al-Hajj' to his name, saying: Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha.\nIn these days, a Kapici came from the Sublime State with a royal gift from His Excellency the Sultan to His Excellency Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha, which was a magnificent Fur (Kurk), a royal sword, robes of honor, andتشريفات (Tashrifat - investitures/honors). That had not happened before for other ministers and rulers, except to the Grand Vizier, holder of the Seal, if he was in a war campaign and conquest of lands happened at his hand. Glory be to the Giver, the Granter.\nThe State had, since a not distant time, removed the regiments of Kapikulu from Damascus, and wrapped turbans were not seen. His Excellency As'ad Pasha, may Allah preserve him, sent requesting regiments from the State. They sent him the Orta (regiment) of On Dokuz (Nineteen). It entered with a great procession, pleasing some people and distressing others. Some wretches wanted to raise their heads, so they informed His Excellency the Pasha about that. He sent saying to the Agha: Whoever enters it from the children of Damascus not of your race, the blame returns only upon yourself. So the situation was organized, the state of the Kapikulu strengthened in Damascus, they wrapped turbans, and their state returned better than it was.\nIn Jumada al-Ula of this year, locusts arrived in Damascus. They had been camping around it for years. They descended on its orchards, eating until they left nothing. His Excellency the Pasha sent two experts to bring him the water of the Samarmar (starling bird). This year had abundant rains, bounties, fruits, and plants. Despite that, the people of Damascus were in great distress from high prices, and prices rose for all goods.\nHis Excellency As'ad Pasha, may Allah preserve him, held a council and sent for wheat sellers, demanding them to bring wheat and threatening them. They swore to him that they had nothing and none was found. He said to them: I have much wheat in Hama, so request it. They sent requesting all wheat found belonging to His Excellency the Pasha and others. Loads of wheat came to them from Hama without count, and they sold it in Damascus at the current price. Despite that, a rotl of bread was five masari, and this hardship has prolonged.\nOn Sunday after Asr, the fifteenth of Jumada al-Thani of this year, cannons were fired. I asked people about the news. It was said: Sa'd al-Din Pasha, brother of As'ad Pasha, received the rank of Vizierate, and a Tugh (standard) came to him. The notables of Damascus hurried to congratulate his brother As'ad Pasha. The first of them to congratulate the Pasha was Fathi Effendi, Defterdar of Damascus. When the Pasha saw him, he stood up and entered the treasury corridor. He followed him and sat with him. As'ad Pasha took out a copy of a petition and showed it to him. Fathi Effendi took it and read it, and lo, it contained the order to kill him.\nHis Excellency the Pasha said to him: What do you say to this? He said: Hearing and obedience. But I am under your protection, take whatever money you want and release me. The Pasha said to him: Woe to you, traitor, I have not forgotten what you did to my uncle's women. Then he ordered lifting his sash and cutting off his head. A rope was put around his neck, he was dragged outside the Saraya, his head was cut off, and sent to the State. Then the Pasha ordered his corpse to be paraded in all the streets, roads, and alleys of Damascus for three days. This was done to him; he was paraded naked, exposed body, and they left him for the dogs. Then his corpse was buried in the cemetery of Sheikh Arslan. The Pasha ordered surrounding his house and money and arresting his aides. They arrested his Khazindar Uthman and his son, and he ordered their imprisonment. Then they brought his biggest aide, nicknamed Al-Afsa, and his head was cut off immediately. They increased the search for his aides, so some of his aides and servants were killed. Then the Vizier seized his estate and the money of all his followers for the Sublime State. It amounted to a great deal. The rest scattered like the hands of Saba (totally dispersed), as if they never were, and a state ended as if it was a phantom of imagination.",

    "text": "The historian Al-Budayri said: That is for what his hands earned. He was unjust, tyrannical, hateful to the people of Damascus, wanting oppression and injustice for them, not respecting the great or the small, except people of evil, who are from the party of Satan, whom he took as equipment for every aggression.\nI summarize the verification of his matter and the news of the story of seizing him, I, the poor one, refiner of history and editor of these papers, so I say:\nAl-Muradi mentioned at the end of the biography of the mentioned Fathi the Defterdar, in summary: The subject of the biography used to be consulted in affairs even by Viziers and Grand Viziers. His state lasted long and Allah's favor upon him was great. His fame spread, his rank rose, and his mention was disseminated. But he used to undertake overreaching in his words and deeds. His followers were famous for corruption, immorality, drinking wine, and violating sanctities. He was also open with injustices, indifferent to the supplication of the oppressed, not avoiding harm and aggression, and was attributed to drinking wine also and other things.\nTherefore, his peers and others wanted him to fall into perils. When Vizier Sulayman Pasha al-Azm, Governor of Damascus and Amir al-Hajj, died, and the order came from the State to seize his wealth and estate, the subject was attributed to [certain] matters. In the meantime, his nephew Vizier As'ad Pasha al-Azm, who was ruler in Hama, assumed governance of Damascus and Emirate of Hajj. He harbored resentment against the subject for his action attributed to him at the death of his uncle, but showed him only what pleased him.\nThe subject was affiliated with the Yerliya Ojak (corps). The Ojak at that time had established powers and its armies were surging with corruption. They were a league and crowds to whom the greatest hero would submit with humiliation and submissiveness. They annihilated people of honor, violated sanctities, and permitted prohibitions. They continued increasing until their corruption pervaded the lands and servants. Their leaders were a stray group and a rebellious faction, and the subject of the biography, Fathi Effendi, bestowed his favors upon them and granted them his benevolence and gifts. They were his core and delegations, having taken him as a pillar and support. The people of intellect in Damascus were in worry, distress, fear, and caution, each of them confused about his affair and fearing this situation and the consequences of his evil.\nThe Amir al-Hajj at that time, the Governor of Damascus As'ad Pasha mentioned, was looking at this situation, confused by those conditions; because the wretch among them would come to the Saraya prison and take out whomever he wanted of the prisoners without anyone's permission, publicly and forcefully. If the mentioned Vizier passed by them while they were sitting, they would not turn to him nor stand for him from their seats when he passed them. Rather, they would speak about him with what is inappropriate within his hearing, so he bore their detestable acts and had no choice but silence.\nTheir affair continued like that, until he wrote about them to the Sublime State. The order arrived to kill and annihilate them. The Vizier hid it for a while, then after that revealed it, and began killing and annihilating them. Allah gave him victory, and distresses were relieved from Damascus.\nThen after a few months, the mentioned Vizier wrote to the Sublime State regarding the subject of the biography and what he was upon. He sent the papers concerning him with Ali Bey, servant (Kul) of Ahmad Pasha. That was by the arrangement of Khalil Effendi al-Siddiqi and the notables of Damascus. Then it coincided that the Grand Vizier (Sahib al-Dawla) was Hasan Pasha. He used to hate the subject Fathi because when the relative of the mentioned Hasan Pasha came, who was Ahmad Agha, the Agha of the Janissary Ojak, he expelled him, and he finally became a Vizier. So he introduced his conditions to the Sultan, and informed him in accordance with As'ad Pasha's correspondence. As'ad Pasha had guaranteed his estate to the State for a thousand purses, so the news of his killing came.\nBefore that, a petition had been made by the people of Damascus regarding him, but it was of no avail as he was in Istanbul, so the petition was given to him. When he came to Damascus, he began bringing it out and taking revenge on those whose names were written in it. The reason for that was the existence of the Agha of the Abode of Felicity (Dar al-Sa'ada), Bashir Agha. The subject was affiliated with him, and the mentioned Agha had supervision and protection over the subject. The destined matter coincided that Bashir Agha died, and the decree came and its time arrived. So the order to kill him came, and he was killed the worst killing in the manner we presented, and at the date we mentioned.\nAl-Budayri, the author of the original, composed these Mawaliya regarding the incident of the mentioned Fathi the Defterdar, saying:\nOh what Fathi did when he became Defterdar ... His time deceived him and his luck turned around his house.\nThe wheel of his glory danced, O people, when it turned ... He did not consider that this time is treacherous.",

    "text": "Despite what he had of bad deeds, he had good deeds and benefit for people at some times. Among his monuments is the Madrasa in Al-Qaymariyya, and he endowed stipends and soup for students of knowledge. He paved the Salihiyya road, and built the bath in Maydan al-Hasa named after him, and the coffeehouse as well. Among his greatest monuments is his renovation of the two minarets of the Sulaymaniyya Takiyya in Al-Marja, after their fall during the earthquake, so they were restored better than they were, and he has other things. However, his bad deeds were more than his good deeds. We ask Allah to cover us with His kindness and pardon, and save us from the disgrace of the world and the punishment of the Hereafter, for He is Near, Responsive, Amen.\nIn those days, they brought the Sheikh of Jayrud. He informed As'ad Pasha that he killed a person. The Pasha asked him, so he answered and said: He killed my father, so I killed him. He ordered his killing, so he was killed immediately.\nOn Sunday, the thirteenth of Rajab of the mentioned year, Muhammad Agha Ibn al-Dayri passed away from dysentery. He had witnessed the deeds of As'ad Pasha, the deeds of his father Isma'il Pasha, and his uncle Sulayman Pasha. He was the expense agent, but all works revolved around him, and he was the owner of the influential word with them, until it was said he was the author of every movement that occurred in Damascus, and that he committed immoralities like drinking wine and others along with harming the subjects. During the days of sedition, he used to walk in front of the Dalatiyya robbing, looting, and destroying the houses of Janissaries. He brought the stones of their houses and their wood and built a house with them. The building was not completed before he perished with the perishing, and the Pasha seized his money and property, and he went with those who went.\nThe day after his death, the Pasha killed Uthman Agha, Khazindar of Fathi Effendi the Defterdar as we presented, and killed with him Ahmad Agha al-Shurbaji, the second Khazindar of Fathi, and seized their money.\nOn this day, Monday the fourteenth of Rajab, they brought the Samarmar water. The Sheikhs and people of Tariqas went out to meet it with flags, drums, and falcon drums. They entered in a great procession in which many people wept. They hung it on the minaret of the Greatest Sheikh (Ibn Arabi) in Salihiyya, on the minaret of the Marja Takiyya, and on the minarets of the Umayyad Mosque. They kept in the Saraya skins of Samarmar water, and mentioned they intended to hang them in the lands of Hauran.\nThis while high prices were standing on foot and leg, the like of which did not occur in ancient times. A rotl of bread reached seven masari, medium six, and bad poor quality five masari. A rotl of cakes fifteen masari, a rotl of rice ten masari. An ounce of ghee five masari at the time of its import, an ounce of tahini five masari, an ounce of sesame oil five masari, an ounce of Qarisheh (cheese/curd) three masari. Likewise cheese and dibs, a rotl for eighteen masari. A rotl of honey for a piastre and a half. A mudd of salt reached twenty masari. A mudd of chickpeas three quarters of a masriyyah, and likewise lentils.\nStranger than that, despite the abundance of fruit, a rotl of fresh figs for four masari, zucchini three for a masriyyah, eggplant a rotl for eight masari, every pumpkin for four masari, a rotl of meat for half a piastre, a watermelon for half a quarter of a riyal, whether yellow or green, and cucumber a rotl for two masriyyahs.\nThis matter lasted for seven or eight years, but in this year the limit increased, and rulers did not inspect the subjects. This with lack of buying and selling, depression, abundance of debts on servants, and oppression of some by others. The vast earth narrowed upon the servants, and judgment is for Allah.\nOn Sunday, the twenty-first of the month of Rajab in this year one thousand one hundred and fifty-nine, His Excellency As'ad Pasha al-Azm gathered the grandees of Damascus and its notables in the court, and endowed all his properties to his children, then to his children's children according to what he stipulated in the endowment deed. He distributed to his cousins what was theirs. He had seized the money of Muhammad Agha Ibn al-Dayri and calculated it according to his mind, so it appeared to His Excellency As'ad Pasha that twelve purses remained for him with the mentioned Ibn al-Dayri. Then the guilds came and informed His Excellency the Pasha that they had remaining dues with Ibn al-Dayri from the days of your father Isma'il Pasha and your uncle Sulayman Pasha. And in the days of your rule twelve thousand piastres, and they persisted in demanding it. He said: Follow him and take them from him, for I have remaining with him twelve purses of gold, so there is no benefit for you in this request. Each of them left his money with Allah and went.\nOn the eve of Friday, the twenty-fifth of the month of Rajab, As'ad Pasha went out to the Dawra (tour) of this year. On the eve of Tuesday, the twenty-ninth of the month of Rajab of this year, Mustafa Effendi Zade, Judge of Damascus, passed away, and his son became deputy in his place.",

    "text": "On Friday, the twenty-second of the month of Sha'ban of this year, Muhammad Agha bin Farrukh arrived with the position of Defterdar of Damascus, replacing Fathi Effendi al-Falaqinsi, and resided in his house famous by them.\nDuring these days, worry increased for people and the stagnation of conditions intensified with severe high prices. Bread was six masari as we presented, until a head of cabbage the size of a bitter orange became two masriyyahs, and the rest in this manner. The matter belongs to Allah, the King, the Exalted.\nDuring these days of this year, the decree of Tripoli of Syria came to His Excellency Sa'd al-Din Pasha. He was with his brother in the Dawra, so he returned with his brother to Damascus, stayed a little, and marched seeking his position, may Allah grant him success.\nIn this year, the confirmation of Ramadan was on the eve of Monday, Eid on Wednesday, and fasting was complete.\nOn Friday after prayer, the seventh of Shawwal of this year, His Excellency the Governor of Damascus and Amir al-Hajj As'ad Pasha al-Azm left intending the Noble Hajj. The Hajj left on the twentieth. When His Excellency the Pasha traveled, he left the Mutasallim there, who was Musa Kikhiya, in his place in Damascus. News reached him that the Zarbawat, who are the expelled wretches, intended to come to Damascus while its people were unaware, and kill a group of those who caused their expulsion. The mentioned Mutasallim was disturbed, and sent to fetch Abdullah the Turk, Agha of the Dalatiyya who was expelled, strengthened his power, and increased his group. Mahmoud Agha, Agha of the Tafakjiya Dalatiyya, began patrolling and roaming at night outside Damascus, and the Dalatiyya hovered around the city. They disturbed the people and distress increased. This situation continued for the duration of the Pasha's and Hajj's absence.\n\nYear 1160\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and sixty entered. Its first Muharram was Thursday. On Monday, the fifth of Muharram al-Haram of this year, corresponding to the first of Kanun al-Thani (January), waters rose due to a great torrent. Its entry into Damascus was at midnight. A flood occurred the like of which had not been heard since ancient times. The water attacked Damascus from midnight, and drowned all shops in its path, and destroyed much wealth that cannot be counted or reckoned, until Al-Marja became like the sea. With that, the water snatched birds, and had a murmuring, buzzing, and roaring. This increase covered the date stone of the Citadel, passed through markets and houses, and brought out unconfined things. It became under the Citadel and in Al-Manakh at the height of a man's stature.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: I entered the Manakhiliyya coffeehouse after the water receded and found the water on its highest benches higher than a cubit. The old and young turned gray from its terror. Unconfined people drowned in it, besides what was destroyed of animals and wealth. It harmed everything it passed over, and many uncountable places collapsed and were left as ruins. We ask Allah Almighty for kindness in what is destined, Amen.\nOn the fifth of Safar was the arrival of the Noble Hajj. The pilgrims reported that this year was one of the most beautiful and best years. All of them were thankful and praying for His Excellency As'ad Pasha continuously, due to the abundant comfort, good, and favors they received on the road from His Excellency the Pasha for all pilgrims. May Allah reward him with the best reward, Amen.\nBakir Shah, Governor of Jeddah, arrived with As'ad Pasha from Hijaz in this year. He stayed in the house of Fathi Effendi mentioned before for about two months in Damascus, then marched intending Hama, and the reason for his coming was not known.\nThe Sheikh al-Islam also returned with the Syrian caravan, stayed a while in Damascus, and marched seeking Istanbul. He was an elderly, dignified man, who did not move a motionless object in Damascus during his stay. After the arrival of the Hajj, the Treasury of Egypt [arrived] to Damascus, having been delayed from its appointment.\nHis Excellency As'ad Pasha intensified the search after his return from Hajj for the Zarb wretches. They arrested Amin Ibn al-Hadid and Abduh bin Hamza Anbar. He ordered their killing, so they were killed the worst killing.\nThe Dalatiyya increased aggression and injustice, and ruined lands and villages. Complaints about them increased to the Governor of Damascus As'ad Pasha. He wrote to the State against them regarding their affair. A decree came to him to annihilate them. So he ordered a crier to call out that any of the Dalatiyya who stays in Damascus more than three days, from the people of corruption and obstinacy, his blood is shed with impunity. Then after days, the Dalatiyya appeared and the matter was not completed. Judgment is for Allah, Knower of the hidden.",

    "text": "On Wednesday, news came that the Anaza Arabs looted the Rasha Arabs, and that the Kurds who were with the Anaza Arabs took all they had looted and robbed of wealth, camels, sheep, and women. The sheep were numerous, their number counted only by Allah. The incident was terrifying, and many were killed from both sides. The helper of the Arabs was His Excellency As'ad Pasha, as it was said. They brought the sheep to Damascus. The people of Damascus had been facing high meat prices and eating corn and barley for years. A rotl of meat was sold in this year for seven masari and eight to ten, with people knowing it was forbidden loot. Some refrained from eating it, and they were fewer than few, and the rest, who were the general public, did not care. To Allah we belong and to Him we return.\nThe historian Al-Budayri, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Locusts had hatched from the previous year in Damascus and its lands. When spring came, they began to appear little by little until they appeared in a hideous manifestation, and began crawling like ants and motes. They began eating crops and destroying plants, so people fell into great distress. His Excellency As'ad Pasha, may Allah preserve him, alerted the peasants generally to collect them and bring them. He imposed on the fifth lands (Al-Khums) two qintars for every land, and likewise villages and hamlets, each hamlet a known amount to collect. They brought loads of it and he ordered it to be buried. Some was buried in a cave near the Baramika cemetery and covered with earth. Then they began digging pits in the graves of Christians and Jews and putting it in them.\nThen it continued to increase and spread. His Excellency As'ad Pasha, may Allah reward him, ordered repeating the obligation on every village of Damascus, two hundred qintars, and whoever did not bring the requirement would face a penalty. He also ordered, may Allah preserve him, some officials to record against them, and to put it in Mount Salihiyya in wells and caves.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: It reached me that in three days they put in Salihiyya one thousand seven hundred qintars of locusts, besides what was put in caves and wells in other than Salihiyya.\nOn Monday, the last of Rabi' al-Thani of this year, news came to Damascus that the bird called Samarmar had come and passed over the village of Adra and Dumayr, and destroyed much of the locusts. The people of the country rejoiced, especially the people of Damascus. The people of Salihiyya went out, accompanied by Sheikhs, Taghaliba (drummers/Sufis?), women, men, and children, weeping and wailing and supplicating to Allah Almighty to lift this affliction and raise the high prices. Then the people of Damascus decorated in joy for the arrival of the Samarmar with the best decoration.\nIn these days, news spread in Damascus that there is a woman in Damascus called Al-Samawiyya who catches children by trickery, and men too, to extract poison from them. People were afraid and panic increased, and people began advising each other against her. After a few days, a clamor occurred among people. It was asked: What is the news? They said: They caught Al-Samawiyya. Behold, she was an old woman caught by the common people, with children and men behind her like locusts, beating her painfully. They went with her to the Judge. He asked her about her condition and where she came from. She said: By Allah, my master, I am a poor woman, I have children and family, and this saying about me is falsehood and slander. He said: The Judge ordered searching her and her house. They searched her and found with her toys that children play with, and in her pocket large and small skullcaps. Then they went and searched her house, and found nothing in it but old belongings and a piece of mat. Then her neighbors testified that she is a poor woman, residing in this place for a long time, and we did not know any evil state about her. Then they released her, and she went on her way.",

    "text": "Then in those days locusts increased and harmed the servants, and it was as if people had collected nothing of it. All this with the increase of immorality, debauchery, delusion, high prices, and evils. Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jabawi went out with the Taghaliba with flags and drums, and intended visiting Sayyida Zaynab. They sought help there for uncovering the affliction from the servants, and returned at the end of the day. Then they circled around the city of Damascus, passed in front of the Saraya gate and performed a Dawsa (trampling ceremony), and a great state and severe weeping occurred. Lamps of the Men (Saints) of [God] were lit, while they prayed for the destruction of locusts and lifting of affliction.\nAfter two days, the people of Al-Maydan came with drums, flags, state, and screaming, intending the Musalla Mosque, praying for lifting the locusts and their destruction. They said: O You who has the will in everything He willed, by the Beloved Chosen One relieve the lands. But that was of no avail. How can that avail when most women have become unrestrained, and daughters of passion, the sinners, roaming night and day in alleys and markets, accompanied by Dalatiyya and immoral men. No one speaks a word, no enjoining of good nor forbidding of evil. The righteous is in worry and distress, and the immoral and bad is turning in delicious bliss. O Allah relieve, Amen.\nOn Thursday, the eighth of Jumada al-Ula of this year, His Excellency the Pasha ordered the Janissaries in Damascus, the Za'ims, Sipahis, and ten individuals from every village to march to the Druze Mountain. He ordered ovens to be built in Al-Biqa' to bake bread. It reached us that a decree came to him that the Pasha of Sidon and Pasha of Tripoli should be with him to assist him, and ordered the Matawila to help him in fighting them.\nThe time was in the month of Iyyar (May), and crops were remaining in the ground, nothing harvested yet. Creation feared from those conditions, and high prices were present in Damascus, a rotl of bread from seven to eight masari.\nOn the eve of Thursday, the fifteenth of Jumada al-Ula of this year, As'ad Pasha al-Azm killed Sayyid Salih bin Ibrahim Bey al-Suqiyya. We asked about the reason, and it was said his father complained to the Pasha that his son Salih spoke to his father with obscene words and wanted to shoot him. His Excellency the Pasha sent and ordered his son be brought humiliated. At evening he ordered him strangled, so he was strangled and thrown, and the command is for Allah.\nOn Friday after prayer, His Excellency As'ad Pasha went out to Al-Marja and ordered the Damascus army of Janissaries and Za'ims to be displayed to him. Then he departed, and three days after his departure the Damascus Ojaks followed him. When he reached Al-Biqa', he destroyed some Druze villages, burned, looted, and killed. Then he raided there Arabs called Al-Furaykhat. They fought him for days, then escaped with their livestock and families, leaving tents and money, that was after they killed a group of the Pasha's soldiers and wounded [others]. We were informed they were obedient. He sent casting their cattle upon the villages and guilds, and did a deed leading to dispute. Then he camped in Al-Biqa' and ordered harvesting the Druze crops, so they harvested the yield of Al-Biqa'. High prices were increasing, and locusts in the land of Damascus increasing, but Allah bridled them as mercy to His creation.\nOn Thursday, the eighth of Jumada al-Thani, five days before the start of the summer forty days (Marba'aniyyat al-Sayf), there was frightening thunder and lightning, and the sky poured rain like mouths of waterskins. Days before that, there was much thunder without rain. These conditions are a lesson for those who take heed.\nIt reached me about His Excellency As'ad Pasha while he was in the Druze Mountain that a complaint came to him from the family of a Sunni victim against a Druze man, that he was a partner to a Turkmen man in about five hundred heads of sheep, and that the Druze assassinated his Turkmen partner and killed him. His Excellency the Pasha ordered searching for the Druze. He was captured and he ordered his killing, so he was killed. He seized the sheep he had and sent them to Damascus, where they were sold by imposition (Tarh) on the butchers of Damascus, each head for eight piastres. Those who complained, he gave them neither dirham nor dinar. To Allah is the matter.\nIn these days, three Jews from the city of Aleppo arrived in Damascus. They had skill in playing instruments with the best tunes. They began working in the coffeehouses of Damascus, and the elite and commoners listened to them.",

    "text": "In the middle of Jumada al-Thani, it reached me that some of As'ad Pasha's soldiers, said to be Maghrebis, provoked the Druze while the Pasha and his soldiers were camping in their lands. They fired bullets at them, and skirmishes with fighting occurred. His Excellency the Pasha stood on his feet, while he was sitting for lunch, and took a spear in his hand, it was said he put on armor, and sought fighting in front of his army. He took before him the Janissaries of Damascus, led by Muhammad Agha bin Abdullah Agha Kumush Aghli. The Agha shouted at his group and sought the raid alone, and the Pasha and the rest of the army followed him. They dragged the cannons and raided earnestly seeking the mouth of the mountain. Bullets from them and on them were like rain. The first to be defeated were the Dalatiyya soldiers, people of arrogance and tyranny. No one, praise be to Allah, from the Damascus Ojak army was hit except a man from the Baalbek Janissaries.\nThen His Excellency As'ad Pasha scolded the Dalatiyya soldiers after severe anger from him, and said to them: Woe to you as helpers, and to him who took you as supporters. You take fodder and money and flee from war and fighting, while volunteers fight for Allah and His Messenger, and race to war, despite what I have done to them of deeds of killing, looting, and destroying homes. But I will acknowledge this matter for them and remove evil and oppression from them. Then he called the Damascus Ojak and promised them benevolence and honor.\nThen the war remained burning for the rest of that day. Then His Excellency the Pasha took the cannons to the mountain, and swore solemn oaths that he would not return from the mountain until he cast everyone in it to destruction and ruin, and make them tales [of the past]. Then he wrote to Homs, Hama, Ma'arra, and Damascus to strip for him sturdy men. He requested from every village fifteen individuals, and set for its people that each one's wage is half a piastre, and sent imposing on them some individuals, and increased on them the impositions of money. He tightened the matter on people until he constricted their breaths, and exceeded measure.\nFour individuals from the elders of the mountain had been killed along with those killed that day. Despite that, they asked for peace and weighed money for him, but he refused except killing and looting. Days before the incident, His Excellency the Pasha had ordered that the crops belonging to the Druze and others be harvested and ordered seizing it. Whenever they collected something, they looted it. There were many blessings, because the yield of this year was something much, the like of which was not heard, and most of it was trampled under feet.\nA rotl of bread in Damascus was six masari. When the new wheat came, they sold it for five masari. Two days later, they called out the rotl for three masari. They said: O subjects, the Lord of creation has bestowed favor upon you, a rotl of bread for three masari. The next day, bribery (Bartil) and corruption worked for the Mutasallim Musa Kikhiya and other people of injustice. Immediately they heard a crier calling that no one sells a rotl of bread for less than four masari. It was said that was from the Sheikh of Millers, nicknamed Al-Takhan; may Allah treat him with what he deserves, Amen.\nThe previous movement which disturbed the Pasha was caused by Allah, and the recompense is of the type of the deed, because His Excellency the Pasha had taken the hand of the mentioned Takhan, the Sheikh of Millers, and the Pasha had ordered him to sell his wheat at the price of a ghirara for thirty-five piastres. Then after the Pasha's march, which was the day of the movement, the price of wheat had gone down, so the price of a ghirara became twenty-five piastres. No one could sell at this price except secretly. The matter narrowed on the poor and needy. Anyone from the common people who moved, they tied him with a long rope, and dragged him either to torture or to killing and looting of money and honor. The command is for Allah, the High, the Great.",

    "text": "The historian Al-Budayri said: It reached me about As'ad Pasha while he was descending to the Druze Mountain that he was informed that a village of Al-Biqa' belonged to the Druze. He ordered his army to loot and rob it. When they reached them, its people met them with cheer, joy, and tranquility, unaware of what was intended for them. They hosted them, slaughtered for them, and entertained them. They dismounted, ate, and had their fill. Then they rose and drew swords against them. They shouted at them: Do not do it, you are our friends and excellent guests. They did not listen but killed a group of them and wounded [others]. They sought defeat immediately and fled from their faces. They looted their belongings, jewelry, and wealth. Then they sought the women, so they fled from them, and entered some orchards there. They were more than three hundred women and virgin girls. That army attacked them, and each one of them grabbed one, while they were screaming with weeping and wailing. They found no helper until they committed the abominable with them. This was reported to me by one who witnessed the reality of this news. They burned the village after looting all that was in it and left its people in woe and exemplary punishment. Sufficient for us is Allah, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs. That was before the incident, and it was said it was the cause of the sedition.\nWhen His Excellency As'ad Pasha gathered the crowds and filled the deserts and quarters, among those who came to the Pasha was Muhammad Pasha of Sidon. He was an elderly man who had experienced time and its people. As'ad Pasha met him with honor and respect and complained to him about what the Druze sect did of treachery and fighting, and asked him for help in this situation. Muhammad Pasha blamed him for that, and ordered him to desist from fighting them. He said to him: This is a matter that returns on us and on you with destruction, and the State does not approve of it because they, meaning the men of the State, want prosperity for the lands and hate injustice and corruption. They are capable of sending ten viziers in one day, but they cannot populate in ten years a village if it is destroyed from these villages. For my sake also, make peace with them, take your money owed by them from the known tribute, and release their children. As'ad Pasha had imprisoned the children of their princes in the Citadel, and they had been there for more than two years, being young and not reached puberty. Then he insisted on him with that.\nHis Excellency As'ad Pasha answered him to that, but outwardly not inwardly, because the intention of the mentioned Pasha was to destroy them to the last one, and this is among the impossible. His Excellency As'ad Pasha said to him: You then manage this matter with your opinion. He said: Let us stipulate on them what you want of conditions. He swore to him that he would not stipulate a condition on them, nor take money, nor do anything with them.\nThen Muhammad Pasha, Pasha of Sidon, bid farewell after he honored and respected him, while concealing the opposite of what he showed. It reached me that at the time he sent news to the Sublime State asking for the Vizierate in Sidon for his brother Mustafa Bey, so that he could do with the Mountain what he wanted, and heal the heart from them. It was said that the Pasha of Sidon sent asking the people of the Mountain for a sum of money for As'ad Pasha. They swore to him they would not give him even a cord (Iqal), but if he sent our children we would send him forty purses, which is customary upon us. Otherwise let him do what he wants, for by Allah if he moves a motionless object we will demolish the country upon him. For what have we done that he meets us with these matters? Is it not enough that he shed our blood and made permissible our wealth and women, and has destroyed for us more than two hundred purses of wheat and grains.\nThis while As'ad Pasha had dispersed what he gathered, and his eyes tearing from his rage, and matters remained under illusions. The Sipahi and Janissary Ojaks returned to Damascus, and matters and conditions were not organized. Judgment is for Allah, the King, the Exalted.\nIn the month of Rajab of this year, which is the year one thousand one hundred and sixty, a war occurred between Bani Sakhr and Anaza Arabs in the land of Hauran due to seizing sheep of some tribes.\nIn this month also, news arrived in Damascus that the Druze came down from the mountain, looted, robbed, and burned eighteen villages of the land of Al-Biqa', and besieged Baalbek and tightened the siege on it.\nOn Wednesday, the eighth of Rajab, Abdullah Pasha Ibn al-Kibrli arrived from Sidon. His coming was from Istanbul, and it was rumored about him that he wants Hajj. He stayed in the house of Abu Shanab.\nOn Monday of this month, Sheikh Abd al-Rahim bin al-Istanbuliya passed away, may Allah have mercy on him. On that day cannons were fired. I asked about the reason, it was said: Sidon came to Musa Kikhiya, Mutasallim of Damascus on behalf of As'ad Pasha. This man was first a Kikhiya under Isma'il Pasha Ibn al-Azm. A Firman came with the Kapici to prepare saddles to fight the Druze, and to tighten on them and destroy them to the last one.",

    "text": "On Monday, the seventh of Sha'ban of this year, His Excellency As'ad Pasha ordered the Dalatiyya and Atliyya to ride and raid the land of Al-Biqa' and those in it of the Druze, to kill, capture, loot, and do what they wanted. Then it reached me that they raided a group of Druze while they were unaware, killing some of them and their Sheikhs, capturing the rest of them, looting wealth, beasts, sheep, women, and children, and came with their heads to Damascus. The day of their arrival was a day from which skins shivered with awe. We ask Him, the Exalted, to rectify conditions, have mercy on the people of Damascus, and lower prices for them.\nOn Thursday, the tenth of Sha'ban, Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jabawi, administrator of the Umayyad Mosque, held a wedding celebration for his grandson. He ordered markets to be decorated with lamps and candles, and ordered the minarets of the Umayyad Mosque to be lit, so they were lit. This is something we never heard had happened for another.\nOn the eve of Saturday, the Guardian Saint, the belief of the people of Damascus, Sheikh Imran son of Sheikh Ibrahim, Imam of the Disease of Happiness (Da' al-Sa'ada - possibly Dar al-Sa'ada?), passed away. He, may Allah have mercy on him, was of the people of spiritual states. He had six fingers on his right hand, and wrote beautiful script with his left hand imitating any script, and had a beautiful voice in reciting Quran. He was buried in Bab al-Saghir next to our master Bilal, may Allah be pleased with him.\nIn this year, news reached us of the death of Ahmad Pasha bin Hasan Pasha, Governor of Baghdad. It was said the cause of his death was that the State sent him a poisoned fur coat, he wore it, poison crept into his body, and he died, may Allah have mercy on him. He was, may Allah have mercy on him, brave, daring, a manager of affairs; servants obeyed him and lands submitted to him. He repelled every tyrant from Baghdad. Tahmasp the Kharijite intended him with a huge army, besieged Baghdad for months but could not conquer it, so he returned humiliated and small, and sought the land of India and Tatars. He set his son upon him who killed and destroyed him. His son took over his place, did not rebel against the State, and his name was Dabbus.\nWhen Ahmad Pasha, Governor of Baghdad, died, the State sent a governor to Baghdad, Kor Muhammad Pasha, who was a former Grand Vizier. When he settled in Baghdad, the Janissaries asked him for 'Ala'if', meaning salaries. He said to them: Your salaries are with me. They said: No, Ahmad Pasha who was before you used to give it to us from his own money, and when it came to him from the State he would take it. He said to them: I will not do that. They said: It must be so, and they were harsh with him in speech, and they were like a raging sea. He said: If it must be so, send to me from your leaders from every town three men, to receive the money. They did so. When they arrived at his place, he ordered killing them and throwing their bodies. When they saw that, they rushed to the Citadel and fired at it with cannons and gunpowder, until they demolished his Saraya, and killed the Agha of his group. The Pasha exited from a tunnel underground leading outside the city and fled escaping to the land of Persia. Then the people of Baghdad wrote to the Sublime State to send a governor to Baghdad for them whom they named for it, who was with his master Ahmad Pasha the aforementioned, and had complete preparedness. So they sent him to them and they were pleased with him.\nOn the twenty-seventh of Sha'ban, As'ad Pasha arrived from the Dawra. His entry was around Maghrib Adhan. Many Maghrebis came with him.\nIn this year, the confirmation of Ramadan was Wednesday. Cannons were fired that night at the fifth hour, and some Imams prayed Tarawih that night. A ghirara of wheat became twenty piastres. Allah help us with this high price, which is a rotl of bread for five masari, rice for eleven masari, and eggplant for four masari.\nOn the eighth of Ramadan, the Sheikh al-Islam came from Istanbul intending Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah. The notables of Damascus went out to meet him. He stayed twelve days, and passed away to Allah's mercy. His grave became in Damascus, buried in Bab al-Saghir south of our master Bilal, may Allah be pleased with him.\nOn Tuesday, the twenty-first of the month of Ramadan, As'ad Pasha alerted that the Riyal be two piastres less a third. It was first a piastre and a half and four masari. Eid al-Fitr in this year was on Friday.\nOn Saturday, the sixteenth of Shawwal, the Noble Mahmal left accompanied by Amir al-Hajj As'ad Pasha al-Azm, may Allah preserve him. He set up Musa Kikhiya mentioned before as deputy for him in Damascus as Mutasallim. A noble decree came after the Pasha's departure to Hajj to release the Druze children from the Citadel. The Mutasallim released them, and there was great joy in the Mountain. Had As'ad Pasha been in Damascus, he would not have released them, because orders had come to him often to release them but he did not release them.\nIn this year, rain is little and high prices much. The main food of the people of Damascus was corn and barley bread. The poor have no helper or supporter besides Allah.\n\nYear 1161",

    "text": "Then entered the year one thousand one hundred and sixty-one. Its first was Muharram Tuesday. Villages were ruined by the oppression of the Dalatiyya, and their unsatisfactory deeds.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: In Muharram, our Sheikh and lover Sheikh Muhammad al-Masri al-Azhari nicknamed Abu al-Surur passed away. He was buried in Marj al-Dahdah near the river in a paved grave with two markers. He, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, was a virtuous religious scholar. Among his virtues is that no one met him without obtaining joy and happiness, even if he did not speak. This is the greatest proof of the goodness of his inner self.\nOn Saturday, the twenty-sixth of Muharram, the Jukhadar of Hajj came, and announced that this year has no equal in cheapness and prosperity. On the fifth of Safar, the Hajj writer came and reported that the Hajj is delayed due to much snow and rain. On the eve of Tuesday of Safar al-Khayr, the Hajj entered at night. The next day, Sunday, the Amir al-Hajj As'ad Pasha and his brother Sa'd al-Din Pasha, Amir of Tripoli of Syria, entered. The pilgrims received every good in this year, and saw no disturber except a torrent that came to them while in Badr, which destroyed and drowned. In the station of Al-Ula, snow, rain, and hail fell, causing hardship for the Hajj, but with great kindness.\nDuring the absence of the Hajj, a report confirming As'ad Pasha in Damascus arrived.\nOn Thursday, the seventeenth of Safar, Sheikh Ahmad authorized us to read every day after Fajr prayer after sending blessings on the Prophet, peace be upon him: 'Ya Aziz' (O Mighty) eighty-seven times. He informed that its properties are great, and that if a person supplicates after it with what he loves, his supplication is answered.\nOn the twenty-second of Safar al-Khayr, the Treasury of Egypt arrived in Damascus. High prices intensified in Damascus, until a rotl of meat became thirty masari, a rotl of rice twelve masari, and bread a rotl for five, six, and seven masari, everyone selling by his opinion.\nAt the end of Rabi' al-Awwal of this year, the ruler of Damascus As'ad Pasha announced regarding flus (copper coins) every nine for a masriyyah, and silver masari every thirty-six for a piastre.\nOn Sunday, the second of Rabi' al-Thani, Muhammad Agha Ibn al-Zarkhali, the Arabic scribe in Tripoli, was killed. He was with Sa'd al-Din Pasha, Governor of Tripoli, in the Jarda. When he returned and reached Damascus, As'ad Pasha ordered him raised to the Citadel. After days, he ordered his killing, so he was killed, and his sin was not known.\nOn Tuesday, the last of Jumada al-Thani of this year, sedition occurred between the Ashraf and the Kapikulu. The reason for that was that a Sharif man bought a pistol from a Sharif man and wanted to test it. He came to the moat to test it. When he fired it, the Agha of the Kapikulu heard its sound, and he was sleeping, so he woke up terrified, and said: Bring me the one who shoots with this rifle. His aides came and arrested him and a group with him. They took them to their Agha, who ordered each of them to be lashed three hundred times. They were beaten painfully and left like dead. Then they put their sashes in their underwear. What was done to them reached the Naqib of Ashraf; so he sent and brought them to his house. The second day, the Ashraf rose on foot and leg, and attacked the Kapikulu and fought. Three of the Ashraf were killed, many wounded, and the whole city closed.\nOn the third day, a council was held at As'ad Pasha's, ruler of Damascus. The notables gathered in it like the Mufti, Naqib, and scholars. Then the council ended, and they ruled against the Kapikulu to give the blood money of the martyr Ashraf to their heirs. Then the Pasha ordered markets to be opened and livelihood sought.\nOn the day of the incident, two of the Ashraf, the first called Sayyid Hasan, Sheikh of the youth of Bab al-Musalla, and the second Sayyid Muhammad bin al-Dahhan from al-Sinaniyya, had attacked with their sticks and assaulted the Kapikulu, driving them back to the Citadel losers. Two days later, on Saturday after Asr, while Sayyid Muhammad bin al-Dahhan was passing in Al-Qanawat, a person from the Kapikulu group shot him with a pistol, hitting him in his stomach. The Ashraf and people of the city rose and attacked As'ad Pasha informing him of the news. He said to them: If he dies I kill his adversary, otherwise I will manage him. The shot man died after Dhuhr. The Ashraf went to the Pasha, who ordered bringing witnesses to judge the killer. They went for witnesses, but no one agreed to testify against the killer. They said: Who testifies to be killed, when his opponent is about five thousand wretch thugs. In short, they did not prove the claim, and left the blood of the Ashraf to go in vain. The command is for Allah, the High, the Great.",

    "text": "These Kapikulu, a Sultanic order and Noble Decree had come regarding them to abolish them from Damascus, and that whoever employs or returns them is cursed son of cursed. But the ruler at that time became certain that the city would not be right except with them, so he confirmed and kept them. Afterward, the Kapikulu started saying: The killing of a Sharif is worth an Akhshaya of silver. Judgment is for Allah, and zeal is for Allah and His Messenger.\nThe next day, Friday, As'ad Pasha held a council, gathering in it the scholars and notables of Damascus, and said to them: Tonight I am traveling on the Dawra, so take charge of the city and do not let anyone transgress against anyone. They said: O our Effendi, we are people, some scholars, some poor, some teachers, and our craft is reading books. He said to them: This is your admission, so how are you the Notables (A'yan)? They said: God forbid, the Notables of Damascus are only the Kapikulu. He said to them: This is your admission, and you have verified that its Notables and Protectors are the Kapikulu. At that point, he sent for the heads of the Kapikulu and handed the city to them. That was cunning from him. Then he traveled and left people turning in the bed of oppression and distress.\nA man from the Ashraf was among those who, during the days of their sedition, opened his shop after things calmed down. While he was opening his shop, a group of Kapikulu arrested him and raised him to the Citadel, after tying him firmly and loading him with chains, as if he were of the Jews or the people of Aad and Thamud. Then they searched for others to join him, so most Ashraf fled. Look, O Muslims, at this justice, and say: O Hidden of Kindnesses save us from what we fear.\nIn those days, corruption increased, servants were oppressed, and daughters of passion multiplied in the markets day and night. Among what happened under As'ad Pasha's rule in these days is that one of the daughters of passion fell in love with a Turkish boy. He fell ill, so she vowed upon herself if he recovered from his illness to read a Mawlid for him at Sheikh Arslan's. After days he recovered from his illness. So she gathered the sluts of the city, the prostitutes, and they walked in the markets of Damascus carrying candles, lamps, and incense burners, singing, clapping hands, and beating tambourines. People stood in rows watching them, while they were unveiled with loose hair. There was no denier of this evil, and the righteous raised their voices saying: Allahu Akbar.\nAmong what happened in the blessed month of Rajab of this year is that a man married his son and held a wedding feast. At evening, he took the groom with an 'Arada (procession), candles, and drums. The aides of the Mutasallim Musa Kikhiya came out against them. The head of the ruler's aides was Mahmoud Basha al-Baghdadi, and he was invited to the feast. When they reached the middle of the market with the Arada, he was the first to assault them. All people fled; this one his Kavuk flew off, this one left his slippers, and the other his cloak was taken. The next day, the ruler ordered the arrest of the boy's father and raising him to the Citadel, and demanded a large sum of money from him. The command is for Allah, the High, the Great.\nIn these days, a man was slaughtered in his bed in the village of Zabdin. On Saturday, the seventeenth of Rajab, a Sharif man was slaughtered in the neighborhood of Bab al-Salam in his house, and no one was found with him. Days before that, this victim's uncle was shot by a man in Al-Darwishiyya with a pistol in his neck, slaughtering him and he died instantly. The historian said: I saw him with my own eyes thrown in the road, and they proved nothing against the killer.\nOn Tuesday, the ninth of Rajab, a Maghrebi entered one of the orchards wanting corruption. The owner of the orchard spoke to him nicely. The Maghrebi cursed and insulted him severely. The orchard owner was brave, so he stood up to the Maghrebi, took his gear, and tied him up. Then he feared the consequence of this matter, so he untied his bond, gave him his gear, and apologized to him. The Maghrebi did nothing but let his meanness overcome him, took his rifle and shot him with a bullet, killing him instantly. The orchard owner's brother came and hit the Maghrebi with a pistol that came to his hand. The Maghrebi wanted to flee. Men and women shouted. A boy came and hit the Maghrebi with a club throwing him to the ground. They tied him and took him to the ruler. He confessed to the killing before the ruler, and the next day they strangled him.",

    "text": "On Thursday, the twenty-first of Rajab, a Maghrebi hit his mother-in-law and killed her. Three days later, he killed a Christian in Al-Shaghour. This Maghrebi was the doorman of Mustafa Bey bin al-Azm, brother of As'ad Pasha, Pasha of Damascus.\nOn the twenty-ninth of Rajab of this year, the sun eclipsed until Damascus darkened. People saw stars as they see them at night. It remained eclipsed twenty-one degrees. People prayed the eclipse prayer in the Umayyad Mosque. The Imam leading the people was Sheikh Ahmad al-Manini, one of the preachers of the Umayyad Mosque. It reached me that at the time of the eclipse, the lamp of our neighbor, the Saint with miracles Sheikh Izz al-Din Abu Hamra, lit up, and his shrine is in his mosque known by him in Bab al-Sarija.\nIn those days, Arabs raided many camels in the village of Al-Qadam, and they were taken and nothing returned. Also in these days, Druze raided the village of Al-Zabadani and others, taking much livestock, goods, and other things.\nOn the eve of Friday, the fourteenth of Sha'ban of this year, the moon eclipsed a total eclipse, until nothing of it appeared. That was at the seventh hour of the night.\nOn Tuesday, the twenty-fifth of the month of Sha'ban, Sayyid Abu Bakr Mulla Khunkar arrived in Damascus intending Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah. He was the first to arrive from the distant pilgrims.\nOn the eve of Monday, the tenth of the blessed month of Ramadan, His Excellency the Governor of Damascus and its ruler, the Perilous Vizier As'ad Pasha al-Azm arrived from the Dawra. He was, praise be to Allah, in utmost health and safety.\nOn the twenty-first day of the month of Ramadan, a man was killed in Suq Saruja, and they arrested his killer. On Monday, the twenty-third of the month of Ramadan, a man was found hanged in the Palace of the Saraya in the Grooms' quarter where the furnace of Hammam al-Malika is. He remained hanging shortly before Asr, and his killer was not known. The Pasha ordered his burial, and he went in vain.\nOn the twenty-fifth, a slain man was found in the cemetery of Bab al-Saghir near the grave of Yazid, and his killer was not known. In this year, we fasted Ramadan thirty days, and Eid al-Fitr was Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, the sixteenth of Shawwal, the Aleppo Hajj came. The next day, the seventeenth, the procession of the Noble Mahmal left accompanied by its Amir and Amir of Damascus Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha. On the nineteenth, the Syrian caravan followed it.\nOn the eve of Monday before midnight, Ahmad Basha bin al-Qaltaqji and his entourage, Abdullah bin Hamza and his group, Kamal Khalil, Anbar Basha, and Ahmad Basha Daqmaq approached, along with a group of Druze who were fugitives, and with them sixty Druze men from Ibn Talhuq's group. They descended in the Maydan quarter, burned the gate of Al-Qabbani's house, and entered his house with trills and shouting. They looted everything in it of goods and others, saw none of the men, and did not approach the harem. They looted two warehouses of wheat and barley. They looted the house of Al-Hajj Isma'il bin Zu'aytar, who was the Sheikh of Camel Drivers, and did not approach the harem; the owner of the house was in Hajj. They looted the house of Abd al-Fattah Agha Bash Shawish, because he was the greatest oppression upon them, and after their flight he used to harm their families. Then they arrested his son and said: If you do not inform us about your father we kill you, and if you guide us to him you have safety. Out of fear, he brought him out to them hiding in a latrine. They killed him and killed with him a man from the Saraya entourage who was passing by them while they were killing him.\nWhen Musa Kikhiya, Mutasallim of Damascus, learned of their deed, he sent for the Governor, Mufti, and Judge, and ordered them to take the Sanjak with them, and called them Kharijites (rebels), and whoever loved Allah, His Messenger, and the Sultan should go out to fight them. The Mutasallim Musa Kikhiya went out with the Kapikulu, Dalatiyya, and Tafakjiya. When they approached Suq al-Suwayqa, they called out to them and sought them. They were staying in the Maydan coffeehouse. Then when they reached Bab al-Musalla, they attacked them from all sides of the Maydan. They killed a group of them and wounded many. They shot the Mutasallim's horse and the Mufti's horse, and returned disappointed.\nThe next day, Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jabawi, may Allah benefit us by him, went to them. They met him and kissed his hands. He said to them: O my children, what is your desire? They said: The Druze prisoners be released to us, our coming is for their sake. He said to them: Tomorrow I return the answer to you. So they stayed that day without fighting. The next day Sheikh Ibrahim came to them and said: O my children, be patient until the Pasha comes or we send to him until his answer comes.",

    "text": "Al-Budayri said: A man from the Turks came on the morning of that day with a number of Dalatiyya. They were in Sidon, so His Excellency As'ad Pasha sent requesting them to serve under his Mutasallim in Damascus. These were the first to strike with the sword, loot, and rob in the movement of the Zarb in Damascus. Their leader was called Abdullah the Turk.\nOn Wednesday, a great massacre occurred, in which about fifty killed fell, from the group of the Mutasallim and Kapikulu. One of the Druze went out and killed two boys. The people of Damascus spent the night and morning in the most ominous state. Then the Mutasallim sent and brought fifty horsemen from Bani Sakhr, and sent to the villages and peasants, until he had a huge army. In those days, the firing of guns and cannons did not cease night and day. The Pasha's soldiers opened the shops of Bab al-Jabiya, looted, ate, drank, demolished the benches and made them barricades.\nOn Thursday, they went early for fighting, and marched towards Al-Suwayqa, with laborers and builders, and burned houses and palaces. After noon, they tightened on the Zarb, the wretches, besieged them, and fired cannons at them, so they turned their backs. They followed them and cut off four heads from them, including the head of Musa Jurbaji, who was counted among the Zarb. He was among those who fled, and was not killed until he charged at the Mutasallim's army four times, with bullets falling on him like rain, until a bullet hit him. He fell, so they cut off his head and brought it to the Saraya. As for Kor Uthman, he was fighting behind barricades, without a weapon but with stones, until a bullet hit him entering from the right of his head and exiting from the left. He fell, and his companions carried him and returned broken and disappointed.\nThe soldiers attacked Al-Maydan, and left no place in it but entered it. The Mutasallim permitted them to loot and rob from Al-Suwayqa to the end of Al-Maydan. So they looted and killed. No house or shop remained but they looted and demolished it. They robbed wealth, killed men, captured women, and exposed their women. This lasted until Asr time.\nThen a group of Zarb came, with a division of Druze and a group of Maydan people. They repelled them from the rest of Al-Maydan. Then when this group that repelled them knew they had no power against those crowds, they fled escaping at night, with a group of Maydan people.\nWhen day broke, the ruler called for safety (Aman), and that markets be opened and no one loots, and whoever loots or takes something, his soul and money will be taken. Then the Agha of Kapikulu went up to Al-Maydan, and people went out to see what happened in it.\nThe historian Ahmad al-Budayri said: I walked with those who walked, and found it a barren plain. The dead were thrown in it, doors broken, shops ruined, and walls demolished. In summary, its state was a state from which bodies shiver and children turn gray. The Almighty said: \"And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned; but He pardons much.\" (Al-Shura: 30).\nFriday morning came, and the people of Al-Qubaybat and remaining houses of Al-Maydan, Bab al-Musalla, and Al-Suwayqa were moving their belongings and what remained of them to inside the city, Al-Qanawat, and Bab al-Sarija. Tremors, fear, worry, and grief fell in Damascus. The elite and commoners feared, even shop owners began moving what they had and placing it inside houses. The houses looted in that incident were one thousand nine hundred houses. As for shops, they cannot be counted by number or calculation. The Kapikulu began taking people and bringing them to the ruler saying to him: This one was fighting with the Zarb, and this one with the Druze, and this and this. The Mutasallim would kill them without law or proof. Each of them intended to take revenge on his enemies.\nAs for the house of Al-Qabbani, an alert occurred from the Mutasallim that whoever took anything from it from the common people should bring it. So the commoners began bringing everything they took of wheat, goods, and dirhams, even bringing sealed money bags. The historian said: Such are fortunes. Matters tightened on the people of Damascus, and they began staying up night and day. People were in worry, grief, and high prices. Every time panic and shop closing occurred, until most houses that were outside the city moved to inside it and to the Citadel.\nOn Thursday, Sa'd al-Din Pasha, brother of As'ad Pasha al-Azm, entered with an army like a raging sea. He was informed of all that happened, so he got angry at the Mutasallim, and harbored distress for him.",

    "text": "In this incident, the attracted Saint (Majdhub) Sheikh Ibrahim, nicknamed Al-Kiki, passed away. He was a blessed man, and his father was a righteous man from the Qubaybat district. In most of his times, he would beat his hands, lean backwards and forwards, and call out at the top of his voice: 'Walak Kiki Ya Ghawwas', and sometimes he would weep and say: 'Baddi Imra'ah Hatta...' (I want a woman so that...), and people would say to him: What do you have in a woman? He would say: A woman is a bread (Khubza). He had occurrences and miracles. Among his miracles transmitted about him and became famous is that one day he saw a man selling yogurt cans. He shouted at the yogurt seller and said 'Baddi ulbah' (I want a can), and began weeping and beating his hands. People gathered and brought out a can for him. The Sheikh said while weeping: I want only this one, and pointed to one of the yogurt cans. They brought it out for him. He took it in his hand and emptied it on the ground, and lo, a snake came down from it. He left it and went away. He has many other miracles.\nThe cause of his death was that a bullet hit his leg. He began weeping and calling: O my father, O Ghawwas, a wasp stung me. He died days later, may Allah have mercy on him.\nOn Tuesday, the sixth of Dhu al-Hijjah, Musa Kikhiya, Mutasallim of Damascus, sent two banners of Dalatiyya with some of their group. They brought him Isma'il Agha Ibn al-Shawish in chains. He was residing in some villages as Subashi. He raised him to the Citadel. Likewise, they brought him his brother Sulayman Agha Ibn al-Hamli and Ahmad Agha Ibn Asakir, and arrested them. It was mentioned to the Mutasallim that they were helping the Druze and Zarb.\nOn Saturday was the Day of Arafah (Waqfa) for Eid al-Adha in Damascus, that year. It was a year of many terrors and pains. Much smallpox occurred in it until it annihilated and killed many children. Glory be to the Everlasting after annihilation.\n\nYear 1162\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and sixty-two entered, and its first Muharram was Saturday. It is hoped from Allah, Blessed and Exalted, that it be a blessed year upon us and upon all our Muslim brothers. Now people are in distress and extra confinement from the abundance of high prices and hardships. But people rejoiced in good due to the abundant rains that fell at the beginning of this year. The litterateur of Damascus, Sheikh Abd al-Rahman, made a good chronogram and a good omen for this year, and included it within these two verses. He said:\nA new year we hope from our Lord ... in it increase of good and boons.\nPerhaps He enriches us with His vast bounty ... since He encompassed us I dated: 'Am Ghina'' (Year of Wealth).\nOn Monday, the second of Muharram of this year, our Sheikh, the Muhaddith of the Syrian lands, rather the seal of Muhaddithin, of whom Damascus was proud over the rest of the world, Sheikh Isma'il al-Ajluni, the teacher under the Dome of the Eagle in the Umayyad Mosque, passed away. No one remained of the people of Damascus, old or young, but attended his funeral. He was buried in the cemetery of Sheikh Arslan, may Allah be pleased with him. May Allah compensate Islam with good.\nIn those days, Ibrahim Agha, Agha of the Kapikulu, separated from his position for months, passed away. He was religious, humble, adhering to congregational prayer in the Umayyad Mosque, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nOn the twenty-seventh of Muharram, the Jukhadar of Hajj approached, and three days later the writer of Hajj came. On the eve of Thursday, the Noble Hajj entered, the fifth day of Safar al-Khayr. On the eve of Friday, the gentle young man of lofty status and noble origin, descendant of the Sadiyya Masters and the Siddiqi branch, Sheikh Bakri bin Sheikh Mustafa bin Sa'd al-Din, passed away, because his father was from the house of Sa'd al-Din, and his mother from the house of Al-Bakri. May Allah have mercy on him and compensate him with Paradise, Amen.",

    "text": "In the early part of the month of Safar, a house in the 'Uqayba neighborhood collapsed on a group, killing seven of them. A man and his wife survived; his name was Sa'id bin al-Shakush. On the tenth of Rabi' al-Awwal, severe painful cold occurred. Charcoal began to be sold on trays, carried on heads, every rotl for five masari, peddled in markets and neighborhoods. This was days before the entry of Husum (unlucky days/cold period), and continued until Husum entered.\nOn the seventeenth of Rabi' al-Awwal, Jukhadariyya arrived from Istanbul and entered upon the Amir al-Hajj and Governor of Damascus Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha al-Azm. He showed that glad tidings came to him from the High Presence, so he ordered fireworks called 'Shenk'. The Kapikulu and soldiers ran towards the Saraya, so the people of Damascus thought an incident occurred, and the city closed down. They informed the Pasha of that, so he said: Fire cannons and make another Shenk. They did, so people calmed down, and their shops opened.\nIn those days, some Turks from the Kapikulu got drunk and wounded three persons from the locals. Days later they died from their wounds, and no claim was raised for them.\nHigh prices increased and calamity grew. Bread was a rotl for six masari for the poor quality, medium for eight masari, and good for twelve masari. An ounce of ghee for seven masari, an ounce of oil for two masriyyahs, and meat a rotl for thirty-six masari. Prostitutes roamed night and day. People were in great distress.\nIn the month of Rabi' al-Awwal, news reached Damascus that a flood occurred in Tripoli of Syria greater than the one that happened in Damascus mentioned before. That was because the river of Tripoli rose greatly and flooded its people until it drowned more than five hundred humans, besides animals, livestock, and wealth. We seek refuge in Allah from the wrath of the Compeller.\nIn those days, the aides of Zahir Umar, Sheikh of Tiberias, raided camels traveling from Damascus, looted their people and took their wealth. The reason for that was that in his land and territory were Arabs and Turkmens, and As'ad Pasha had ordered them to raid them. So they raided them, looted them, took their wealth and sheep, and killed a group of them. They came with their sheep, so the Pasha distributed them on the villages and butchers of Damascus. What was worth a piastre, he imposed forcibly for five piastres, and so on.\nIn this month, a rotl of bread went from eight masari to twelve masari, Ma'ruk to seventeen masari, a rotl of garlic to twenty-four masari, a ghirara of wheat to fifty-two piastres, a ghirara of corn to forty-eight, eggs two for a masriyyah, a rotl of rice to fifteen masari, and a rotl of charcoal to six masari. Everything exceeded its limit, and judgment is for Allah regarding His servant.\nIn the month of Rabi' al-Thani, As'ad Pasha killed three individuals from the Matawila and killed Al-Bathish from the group of Zarb wretches fleeing during the days of the incident.\nOn Monday, the fourth of Jumada al-Thani of this year, the Judge of Damascus Sayyid Muhammad Effendi Bashmaqji Zade entered.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: It reached me that Hamid Effendi Ibn al-Imadi, Mufti of Damascus, had hoarded wheat like the grandees and notables who do not fear the Merciful, the Compassionate. The measurers came to him and said: We sell wheat, every ghirara for fifty piastres. He said to them: Wait, perhaps the price will increase. If the Mufti of Muslims has no compassion for Allah's creation, do not blame others.\nIn these days, they held a council, and informed As'ad Pasha of the abundance of evils and gathering of prostitute women in alleys and markets, and that they sleep on shops and in bakeries and coffeehouses. He said: Let us make a way for them either by deporting them or placing them in a place they do not exceed, or we consider their matter. He said: I will do nothing of these conditions, nor let them pray against me night and day. Then the council dispersed, and no benefit resulted from their meeting.\nIn those days, high prices increased in the lands of Sham. It reached us that a rotl of bread in Tripoli was ten masari, in Gaza and Ramla twenty-five masari, and in Damascus it was not stable on a price. High prices, calamity, and oppression increased.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: In these days, As'ad Pasha, Governor of Damascus, bought many properties of houses, orchards, mills, and other things. This was before building his house and Qaysariyya.\nOn the eighth of Jumada al-Thani of this year, new barley came down. They sold barley bread a rotl for four masari, and white for six. Then the next day the crier went out that wheat bread be sold for four masari and white for six masari. No result occurred for the poor; every day a new price, and Allah does what He wills.\nOn Thursday, the twelfth of Jumada al-Ula, the virtuous scholar Sheikh Abd al-Wahhab al-Dalati passed away, may Allah have mercy on him.",

    "text": "On Wednesday, the eleventh of Jumada al-Thani, new wheat came down. A ghirara of wheat was sold for forty-five piastres, while before its arrival it was fifty-two. The common people shouted and sought help, and looted some bakeries. Then they began calling in the markets a rotl of bread for three masari and four masari. So all people of Damascus sold at that price. The people of the city rejoiced greatly, so the city was decorated.\nHis Excellency Governor As'ad Pasha was in his father's garden in Masjid al-Aqsab having a picnic with the notables of Damascus. When this news reached him, he became extremely angry, and ordered Al-Hajj Mahmoud Tafakji Bashi to take his immoral aides and go around the city and markets, and warn the bakers not to sell a rotl of bread except for six masari and the black for four, and whoever disobeys will get a beating. Beware, then beware. So they returned to the first method, bread blackened and changed, and Allah is Greatest and Most Jealous.\nOn the sixteenth of Jumada al-Ula, a ghirara of wheat became twenty-six piastres, so a rotl of bread was sold for three masari, and distress began to disappear by the permission of Allah Almighty.\nIn those days, news reached Damascus that Abdullah Agha bin Hamza and Kamal Khalil, who were among the heads of the Zarbawat defeated from Damascus, were captured by Zahir Umar, ruler of Tiberias Fortress. He cut off their heads and sent them to Sidon, and the governor of Sidon sent them to the State, and sent asking for a Noble Decree that As'ad Pasha, ruler of Damascus, should not pass through the land of Tiberias in his travel on the Dawra.\nOn Monday, the first of Rajab the Unique of this year, As'ad Pasha, ruler of Damascus, called out that whoever drank coffee would be hanged and crucified. Then he ordered its removal, so it was removed from all coffeehouses and markets of Damascus. The historian Al-Budayri said: Drinking it in Damascus had become one of the greatest calamities; men, women, and even girls drank it. May Allah reward him with good.\nOn the third of Rajab, the bakers and market people called out that a rotl of bread is four masari and the special five masari, and that mixed with corn or barley two masari. Out of the abundance of joy of the people of Damascus, especially the poor, they began weeping and wailing with joy, as Allah relieved them. Most markets of Damascus were decorated. On that day, a ghirara of good wheat and barley was sold for eight piastres. Allah relieved His servants by His favor and generosity.\nOn Friday, the second of blessed Sha'ban, Khalil Agha and Ahmad Agha, sons of Ibn al-Darzi, entered and met the Mutasallim of Damascus. He received them with the best reception. They had a Boyuruldu (decree) from As'ad Pasha, as they met him through the mediation of Sheikh Ibrahim al-Sa'di al-Jabawi, may Allah benefit us by him and his ancestors. They were fugitives with the Arabs. He gave them safety (Aman), when it appeared they had no guilt in those deeds.",

    "text": "The crescent of Ramadan appeared this year. Two days before Ramadan, the Judge of Damascus Sayyid Muhammad Effendi Bashmaqji Zade went out to Salihiyya with his harem. Then he returned at Asr time from Salihiyya with his harem, drawing a weapon with a pistol in his hand, one foot with a slipper (babuj) and the second barefoot without a slipper. He had wounded a person from his group. He remained in this state until he reached the court. Then it appeared he was drunk...\nThe historian said: I investigated the reason for the Judge descending in this manner, and the matter appeared contrary to what we mentioned of him being drunk. Rather, it was from a sharpness of temper that occurred from him. The reason for that is he had a concubine, and he was infatuated with her, so much that he divorced his wife for her sake. His wife wanted to disturb his life. One day some guests came for his concubine whom he loved. She wanted to put food, chicken, and other things before the guests from what the Judge prepared for lunch in Salihiyya. The Judge's wife prevented her, and she was not generous. When the Judge came, his concubine informed him of that, and that she did not put food or anything before my guests, then she began to weep. The Judge loved her extraordinarily. So he rose against his wife and divorced her, as it was said that was the reason for her divorce. He rose against his servants and drew a weapon on them, ordered the harem to descend, and demanded his mount, but they were slow. Then he found a single slipper so he went down with it to the bridge, then rode and went down to the court in that state. His enemies claimed he was drunk while the matter was otherwise.\nThen this action did not suffice his divorced wife, until she complained against him to the Sublime State. The order came with a decree of his dismissal and exile to the island of Cyprus and seizing all his wealth for his wife. They sold all his belongings, and took all the money he had, amounting to eight purses, and gave them to his divorced wife. This was by order of the State. Then most people regretted him, other than those with agendas, due to what the mentioned Judge was upon of integrity, contentment, humility, and great generosity, such that in the month of Ramadan he would eat a qintar of ghee and of rice likewise, and of meat likewise, so that at least there would be about thirty people at his place in Ramadan besides the poor. Since he did not take bribes nor incline in a lawsuit, the people of Damascus turned against him with his wife, until they heard of his dismissal as is their custom of old.\nOn Sunday, mid-Shawwal, the Treasury of Egypt came to Damascus. On Monday, the sixteenth of Shawwal, the Noble Mahmal left with its Amir Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha bin Isma'il Pasha al-Azm. This was the seventh Hajj for the mentioned His Excellency As'ad Pasha. His father Isma'il Pasha had performed Hajj six times. This Hajj in this year is the seventh for As'ad Pasha.\nThe day after the Mahmal's departure, the Mutasallim hanged two of the wretched thieves. They had many incidents. It was finally proven that they broke into a house at night and stole all expensive items in it. The name of one of them was Sheikh of the Takiyya.\nFour days after the Syrian Hajj left, Sayyid Yunus, partner of As'ad Pasha, left with a huge caravan accompanied by a large group, and they caught up with the Pasha and Hajj at Muzayrib.\nIn this year, As'ad Pasha renewed the upper rooms in his father Isma'il Pasha's Madrasa in Suq al-Khayyatin, made a mosque and Khutba in its southern part, and arranged parts of Quran, soup, oil, and other things. May Allah reward him with good.\nOn the ninth of Dhu al-Qi'dah, the Judge mentioned before traveled to Sidon, intending Cyprus with the intention of exile to it. Some notables went out to bid him farewell.\nOn the fifteenth of Dhu al-Qi'dah, they publicly shamed three persons and circulated them in the whole city, faces blackened, riding donkeys backwards. We asked the reason, and it was said they mint Ramliyyah flus (coins), which is fraud. One was Kurdish and the second Dagestani.\nOn that day, the ruler ordered to expel the daughters of passion, the sluts, from the city to outside the city, and showed he wanted to exile them to other lands. He warned the neighborhood Sheikhs that whoever a suspicious person is found in his neighborhood has only himself to blame. Then a crier called out that women should not lower veils over their faces, except the Pasha's harem and Musa Kikhiya's women. Then the ruler's aides began inspecting and were strict. Some distress was relieved. Then this strictness did not last but a few days, when we saw the mentioned girls walking as their habit in alleys and markets and more. They returned to the city, and the ruler arranged on them ten piastres on each one every month and appointed a Subashi over them; rather, he cut from people and robbed. Allah is the Helper.",

    "text": "On Tuesday, Sa'd al-Din Pasha, brother of As'ad Pasha bin al-Azm, entered Damascus with a great procession, because he is the Sardar of the Jarda and its Amir, and he had marched with it in the past year.\n\nYear 1163\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and sixty-three entered, and its first Muharram was Thursday. The cold is great and high prices remaining, did not cease. Bread remained at five masari, a rotl of rice at twelve masari, a rotl of meat at twenty-four masari, a rotl of charcoal at three masari, a rotl of dibs at eight masari, and an ounce of ghee at five masari. The ice that occurred this year, we have not heard its like. We ask Allah Almighty for kindness.\nIn the middle of Muharram of this year, the working scholar Sheikh Muhammad al-Dayri passed away. He used to teach in the Umayyad Mosque, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him. Two days after him, the ascetic scholar Sheikh Mulla Abbas al-Kurdi, successor of his Sheikh Mulla Ilyas al-Kurdi, passed away in his place in Al-Addas Mosque, may Allah have mercy on him, and was buried at the foot of Mount Qasioun.\nOn the twenty-eighth of Muharram, Sheikh Isa, Imam of the first prayer in the Umayyad Mosque in the niche of the Shafi'i Masters, passed away. He, may Allah have mercy on him, was a righteous man, good in recitation, good voice, always wearing white clothes, and his turban of white wool. His funeral was attended by many, only a few lagged behind. He was buried in the Baramika cemetery south of Al-Marja, may Allah have mercy on him.\nOn that day, the sun eclipsed, and remained eclipsed for about three hours. People prayed the eclipse prayer in the Umayyad Mosque.\nThe entry of the Noble Hajj that year was on Wednesday, the fifth of Safar. The next day, Thursday, the Amir al-Hajj As'ad Pasha entered with the procession of the Noble Mahmal. This is the seventh year of his consecutive pilgrimages. Pilgrims mentioned that this year is the most blessed, best, and cheapest of years going and returning. His Excellency Sa'd al-Din Pasha entered with his brother As'ad Pasha, both in utmost health.\nOn the twenty-fifth of Muharram, the Mutasallim of Damascus Musa Kikhiya hanged five persons of the wretched Druze. In those days, the Judge of Mecca died and was buried in Bab al-Saghir.\nOn Sunday, the twenty-third of Safar, the ascetic Saint Sheikh Muhammad bin Abd al-Hadi al-Umari passed away. They prayed over him in the Umayyad, and he was buried in Marj al-Dahdah. His funeral was crowded with men and women, may Allah have mercy on him.\nOn the twenty-fifth of Safar, the Pasha hanged three men. The people of Douma brought them to Governor As'ad Pasha, informing him they found with them a saddlebag containing goods belonging to the Sultan's Kaftaji. He ordered their crucifixion.\nOn Saturday, the last of Safar, Sa'd al-Din Pasha traveled to the place of his assignment which is in Tripoli. In those days, Sheikh Mustafa al-Kurdi, who was residing in the Madrasa of Sulayman Pasha bin al-Azm, passed away. He was a religious jurist. He was buried at the foot of Qasioun, may Allah have mercy on him. In these days also, Najib Effendi al-Safarjalani passed away. He was among the leaders of Damascus notables. He had a great funeral and was buried in the cemetery of Bab al-Saghir.\nAlso passed away in those days, in early Rabi' al-Awwal of this year, the righteous scholar Sheikh Mustafa bin Sheikh Shu'ayb from the neighborhood of Bab al-Sarija. He had a great funeral with flags, and all Sheikhs of Tariqas went out in his funeral. He was buried in Bab al-Saghir, may Allah have mercy on him.\nIn those days also passed away the ascetic Saint, whom divine attraction overcame, Sayyid Mustafa bin Sheikh Murad. The state and acceptance in Damascus and Istanbul belonged to his nephew Sayyid Ali Effendi. All notables went out in his funeral and he was buried in Bab al-Saghir, may Allah have mercy on him.\nOn the eve of Monday, the perfect Saint of apparent miracles and dazzling states, who cast off restraint and night and day were equal to him, drank from the wine of the Compeller's drink, and was given the degree of acceptance among great and small, Sheikh Muhammad Jabri, passed away. He used to sometimes be absent, sometimes present, and sometimes intoxicated. He had a group and disciples, and was in the rank of Sheikh Ahmad al-Nahlawi, whom he used to visit during his life. When Al-Nahlawi died, a group of the Sheikh's poor (Fuqara) stuck to him, going around with him and sleeping where he slept. His death was in Bab al-Sarija, and he had a great funeral.\nIn the middle of Sa'd al-Dhabih, snow came for two days and two nights without interruption and was not followed by rain. It remained on roofs and in alleys for more than twenty days, until a rotl of charcoal became half a piastre and a third, a rotl of bread from four masari to eight, an ounce of ghee five masari, and a rotl of meat thirty masari. In summary, everything is expensive, and creation is in trouble of mind.",

    "text": "In those days, a Kapikulu killed a Sharif man after Isha. The mother of the killed complained to Vizier As'ad Pasha and stuck to him. He ordered bringing him, so they caught him after he fled. The Vizier ordered strangling him, so he was strangled in the Citadel.\nIn those days, the literary poet and intelligent virtuous man, whom no poet in his time wove on his loom, Sheikh Abd al-Rahman al-Bahlul passed away, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him. He was buried in Bab al-Saghir opposite the houses of Al-Nahhana from the side of Al-Shaghour. This Al-Bahlul, possessor of acceptance, is the author of the poem with which he praised the Master Sheikh Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi containing more than a hundred dates (chronograms); in every hemistich there is a date. When he presented the poem to his praised master, and the Sheikh saw it was unique in its kind with this astonishing wondrous format, he said to him: We have sought Allah's guidance regarding you, O Sheikh Abd al-Rahman, and made you the Sheikh of Literature in Damascus.\nOn Monday, the fifteenth of Rabi' al-Awwal, the roof of the narrow market behind the Umayyad Mosque which contains the coffeehouse fell. Its fall was after the Hanafi prayer. A group was under it; four persons died and a group was crushed.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: On Thursday, the eighteenth of Rabi' al-Awwal, we went out for a picnic to the Sharaf area overlooking Al-Marja with some of our loved ones. The time was at the beginning of blossoming. We sat overlooking Al-Marja and the Salimiyya Takiyya. Behold, women more than men were sitting on the edge of the river, eating, drinking, coffee, and tobacco, just as men do. This is something we never heard its like occurred until we witnessed it. There is no power or strength except with Allah.\nThe historian said: Then we continued in joy and relaxation, until I recited these Mawaliya saying:\nA day passed for us, its like never preceded, O uncle ... In the meadow of Sham you don't see an empty place.\nWhat a Thursday passed, no villains encountered it ... On the eighteenth of Rabi' al-Akhir the cold went.\nO people of literature date it: Distress has gone from you.\nOn that day, an architect fell from the roof of Suq al-Khayyatin and died instantly.\nThe next day, Friday, the nineteenth of Rabi' al-Akhir, Sheikh Muhammad bin Jaqayjaqa passed in Al-Amara carrying cauliflower in his hand, when he fell to the ground lifeless. He was carried to his house dead, may Allah have mercy on him.\nIn those days, As'ad Pasha took the house of Mu'awiyah, may Allah be pleased with him, and took what was around it of Khans, houses, and shops, demolished them, and began building his house, the famous Saraya which is south of the Umayyad Mosque. He strove and exerted effort in its building night and day. He cut for it from a total of timber a thousand timbers, besides what the notables of the city and grandees sent him of timber and other things. He ordered the baths of the city not to sell Qasarmal (cinder) to anyone, but send it to the building of the Saraya. Most teachers (masters) of the city and its carpenters worked on it, as well as painters. Indeed, rarely is a master craftsman or carpenter or painter found but all are working on it. He brought tiles for it from most houses of the city; wherever tiles or marble and other things like columns and basins were found, he sent and uprooted them for a small price.\nNear the Baramika cemetery was a palace called Al-Zahrabiyya. It was said to be built by King Al-Zahir. It is on the back of Baniyas overlooking Al-Marja. It was a great promenade place, most of it demolished. Near it is a tomb with a stone dome, the top of the dome uprooted. It has a depression; it was said there was an ancient treasure in its top so it was taken.\nThe historian said: It reached me about the reason for taking it that written on the door of the dome wall was these Mawaliya:\nManage your time and your companion then manage her ... And avoid people high and low.\nIf they ask you about people's faults cover them ... The mind in the head is its judge and governor.\nEveryone who read it imagined something, until the owner of the share came at night, climbed to the top of the dome, dug it and took what was in it. It remained headless until our time, until they informed His Excellency Vizier As'ad Pasha al-Azm, owner of the building, about this dome and the tomb beside it, and that riffraff and wretches gather there night and day for immorality and corruption and other things. So he ordered demolishing it immediately and transporting its stones to his house.",

    "text": "In those days, it reached His Excellency Vizier As'ad Pasha that in the house of Ibn Kaywan there was an old mill, called the Monks' Mill, which had been demolished and only the traces of its bottom remained, and that it was installed on Baniyas. Immediately His Excellency the Pasha ordered cutting off the Baniyas river and extracting all columns and stones in it and transporting them to the house. Laborers, stonemasons, and gardeners worked, and continued uprooting stones and transporting them to the Pasha's house for twelve days, while the river was cut off from its owners.\nOn Thursday, the twenty-sixth of Rabi' al-Thani of this year, Hasan Effendi al-Safarjalani held a banquet for His Excellency As'ad Pasha, Governor of Damascus, in Salihiyya in the hall of Ibn Qarnaq. It was a great hospitality, said to cost about eleven hundred piastres. His Excellency the Pasha looked at towering cypress trees in his house, and requested their owner Ali Agha bin Qarnaq to cut them for the building of his house. As'ad Pasha, owner of the building, offered him some money, but he refused to take anything of their price, and cut for him three cypresses having no equal in Damascus or elsewhere. He transported from the village of Bosra stones and marble columns, a lot of them. He took from the Madrasa of King Al-Nasir in Salihiyya thick columns brought loaded on carts pulled by oxen. He demolished the Zanuziyya market above the Amara district, which was all vaulted arches, ordered dismantling it and transporting it to his referenced house. He also transported to it columns from Yilbugha Mosque. Whatever he heard of exquisite tiles, columns, or stones from any place, he would bring them by purchase or otherwise.\nThe historian Ahmad al-Budayri, may Allah forgive him, said: In those days, Ibn Khattab al-Dalati was killed in Suq al-Bazuriyya at the time of Isha Adhan. A weapon blow came to his head, taking half his neck with his head, so he fell dead as if he never was. This while the Vizier of Damascus is busy building his house, paying no attention to his subjects and supporters, saying: Bring me marble and alabaster stones and cypress, and excel in building, engraving, and adorning with gold and silver. He brought marble columns on carts and oxen from Bosra, destroyed the market of Masjid al-Aqsab, brought all stones and wood in it. Whenever he heard of a piece or masterpiece of marble or Qishani or others, he sent and brought it whether its owner accepted or refused.\nIf a poor man wanted to build or repair, he found no architect, carpenter, wood, nail, soil, cinder, or stones. This with high prices and descent of distress. His Excellency the Pasha took an ample amount of Qanawat water, so it did not reach the Saraya until paths and waters of most mosques and baths were cut off, and it remained cut off for a while even from most houses.\nIn those days, Ali Effendi al-Muradi held a hospitality for His Excellency As'ad Pasha in the village of Babbila on the road to the Lady's Tomb (Qabr al-Sitt). It was a crowded hospitality for lunch and dinner.\nIn those days also, His Excellency Vizier As'ad Pasha al-Azm ordered the administrator of the Umayyad Mosque, Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jabawi al-Sa'di, to fix the conditions of the mentioned Mosque and inspect its interests. Immediately they started restoring the western minaret, removed idle stones in it, removed old mats and carpets in it, and furnished it with new furnishing by the determination of His Excellency the Pasha.\nOn Monday, the sixth of Jumada al-Ula, Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha went out and had a picnic in the land of Ghouta, accompanied by the grandees and notables of Damascus.\nOn Friday, the tenth day of Jumada al-Ula, while people were at Friday prayer, a man threw himself from the Citadel of Damascus towards the Manakhiliyya coffeehouse. His hands and legs were broken. The reason for his imprisonment was that he was accused of deflowering a girl.",

    "text": "In those days in the Roman month of Adhar (March), a severe storm wind blew the like of which was not heard. The regions of Damascus shook from it, until people thought the Resurrection had risen. It was followed by severe cold and continuous rain until the end of the night.\nIn those days, a man from the Turks came to Damascus, with a copper plate which he places on a stick and spins it on it, throws it up the height of two men, catches it on the stick while spinning, and transfers it from finger to finger while spinning, collecting money from spectators. Then the boys of Damascus began doing like his deed. He was amazed at that and mentioned he toured many countries in the world and no one could do like his deed. Then he traveled and was not seen afterwards.\nStranger than that, a man also from the sons of Turks came before the one we mentioned. He claps with his fingers, hitting one on the other, stomps his foot on the ground firmly, and sings in Turkish and Arabic. People gather around him and give him money. Small boys of Damascus began doing like his deed and better. He mentioned he toured many cities in the world and no one learned this craft except boys of Damascus, and was astonished by their intelligence.\nIn Jumada al-Akhira, a man was killed in the 'Uqayba district. We asked the reason, and it was said he was a man working in a bakery. He went to his bakery at the end of the night, locked his house door, and left his wife sleeping. When he reached his bakery and settled for a while, a warner came to him and informed him he saw men entering his house. He came running immediately, found the latch open, felt the door and found it bolted. He shouted at his wife and she answered him. He said to her: Who is with you? She shouted: Oh my honor! Who would be with me? He said to her: Open the door. She made excuses of inability to open the door. He shouted loudly, and behold the door opened and men came out of it. One of them hit him with a pistol in his chest killing him instantly. When day broke, they informed His Excellency Vizier of Damascus As'ad Pasha. He brought the woman before him and asked her, she denied, so he ordered her imprisonment. She was imprisoned and her husband's blood went in vain.\nIn those days also, a woman who killed her husband was brought to His Excellency Vizier As'ad Pasha. He asked her the reason. She said to him: He married [another] over me. When it was my night, he slept and left me, so I got up and cut off his penis, and said: Neither for me nor for her. So he died from that. His Excellency the Vizier laughed and did nothing to her except ordering her imprisonment.\nOn the twenty-first day of Jumada al-Thani of this year, the Governor of Damascus went to the Dawra, and his Mutasallim was Musa Agha Kikhiya. The second day of the Pasha's departure, his mentioned Mutasallim hanged two, said to be Matawila who were highwaymen. Then he announced that no one after Isha prayer should go out, neither with light nor without light. This is something that never preceded. Then he himself began patrolling at night. He was among the tyrants.\nIn this year, the first of Rajab was proven Saturday, the night of mid-Sha'ban was the eve of Monday, and the first of Ramadan was Tuesday.\nOn the sixteenth of Ramadan, the Surra Emini procession entered; the Treasury of Egypt also entered Damascus. On the twenty-first of it, the Baltajiyya entered.\nOn the eve of the twenty-fourth after Tarawih prayer, a Kurd called Kara Mustafa was killed in Al-Hadra, and his adversary was not known. They accused a Baghdadi man of it. The Kurds armed themselves and descended until they reached Al-Darwishiyya and Bab al-Jabiya hoping to encounter one of the Baghdadis to kill him, but found none. Crowds were in Al-Darwishiyya in rows and thousands. With the Kurds' attack, they scattered and fled, and fear and terror entered people's hearts. To Allah is the destination.\nAfter three days, the Pasha arrived from the Dawra, his entry being with Maghrib Adhan.\nAt the end of Ramadan, the day of Waqfa (eve of Eid), the Kurds killed two Baghdadis to take revenge for the killed Kurd mentioned before. The Baghdadis and Mosulis armed themselves, helped by Tafakjiya and Kapikulu, and sought the Kurds' Khan. The Kurds fired a volley of bullets at them, killing a group and wounding [others]. They returned on the Kurds, looted some of their coffeehouses, and wanted to make a jumhuriyya (riot/rebellion) and raise sedition in the city. His Excellency the Vizier, may Allah preserve him, forbade them from that, and matters remained folded.\nEid al-Fitr was Wednesday, and we fasted Ramadan completely, after we used to fast it incomplete for years. After days, the Treasury of Egypt departed for Istanbul. On the seventeenth of Shawwal, the Amir al-Hajj departed with the Noble Mahmal and the lofty procession, Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha al-Azm. This year is the eighth of his consecutive pilgrimages. The next day the Aleppo Hajj came. On the twenty-first of Shawwal, the Syrian and Aleppo Hajj departed from Damascus. After five days, Hajj from the Persians came, and followed the Hajj to Muzayrib from the direction of Al-Lajat. The Hajj departed from Muzayrib on the twenty-seventh of Shawwal.",

    "text": "After the Pasha's departure, the Mutasallim called out regarding Ramliyyah flus, every twenty-one fals for a masriyyah. He released the Baghdadi accused of killing Kara Mustafa the Kurd; they had raised him to the Citadel. Days after his release, he got drunk, rioted, and beat two donkey drivers killing them. The city was disturbed. The Mutasallim sent in search of him, but he fled and no trace appeared for him, nor did they find news of him. They arrested a Mamluk of his and strangled him.\nThree days before His Excellency As'ad Pasha left for the Noble Hajj, the construction of the Pasha's house, which is for the harem, was completed. It was furnished with the best furnishings, and he moved his harem to it.\nIn those days, a great battle occurred between the Druze and Matawila. With the Matawila were also the sons of Zahir Umar, ruler of Tiberias. Killing occurred on both sides. They counted the Druze dead, and they were about nine hundred killed. It is a big sedition.\nOn Saturday, the fifth of Dhu al-Qi'dah, cannons were fired. We asked about the news, it was said a decree came from the Sultanate confirming As'ad Pasha al-Azm as Governor of Damascus.\nThe historian Al-Budayri said: On the eve of Wednesday, twenty past the month of Dhu al-Qi'dah of this year, Sheikh Isma'il, son of our Sheikh and teacher Sheikh Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, passed away. He died leaving thirty children from his sons and grandsons. He lived seventy-seven years, because his birth was year one thousand eighty-five, and his father the Master's birth was year one thousand fifty, and his death year one thousand one hundred and forty-three, so the Master his father's age would be ninety-three years. His death was in Salihiyya, and he was buried in their house in Al-Anbariyya south of the Umayyad Mosque. His bier was carried to Salihiyya, and he was buried in his father's house next to his son Sheikh Tahir. May Allah Almighty have mercy on them and benefit us with their blessings all.\n\nYear 1164\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and sixty-four entered. The start of Muharram was Tuesday. May Allah make it a year of good and blessing upon us and the Muslims.\nOn the twenty-sixth of Muharram, the Jukhadar of the Noble Hajj came, and announced regarding Hajj all good of abundance of cheapness, water, and other things, praise be to Allah. However, high prices did not leave Damascus. This year entered with a rotl of bread at five and six masari, a rotl of rice ten masari, a rotl of meat twenty-eight masari, a rotl of dibs nine masari, an ounce of ghee six masari, currency is adulterated, flus are unminted, women unrestrained, men wandering, limits lost, notables busy, and men's chivalry tied, to the end of what the historian said.\nIn those days, they brought four heads of Arab highwaymen, brought by Isa Basha al-Habash, one of the fleeing Zarbawat, so he was pardoned for that.\nOn the twenty-ninth of Muharram, the Hajj writer came, and mentioned that this year is the most comfortable and best of years in the days of Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha, Governor of Damascus, may Allah preserve him. Except that a great torrent came to them in Asfan, stalling them for days, then the Pasha ordered them to march earnestly until he left two out of ten, thus some pilgrims told me.\nThe Hajj entered on Wednesday, the second of Safar. The next day, Thursday, the Noble Mahmal entered, and As'ad Pasha and his brother Sa'd al-Din Pasha, Sardar of the Jarda, with the great procession.\nOn the eighth of Safar, the Judge of Damascus Abdullah Effendi Sa'id Zade entered at night, having majesty and awe, and did not speak with gossip.\nIt reached us that Uthman Pasha the Collector, Governor of Jeddah, died and was buried there.\nIn those days of this year, the position of Aleppo came to Sa'd al-Din Pasha, brother of As'ad Pasha. He moved from Tripoli with his family and went from Damascus to Aleppo. They rumored that his predecessor, the ruler of Aleppo, was unjust and tyrannical, destroyed many villages, built many buildings taking most expenses from the people of Aleppo, and built a mosque there that dazzles the eyes.\nAfter Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha arrived from the Noble Hajj, we found his house construction completed. When he entered it, he increased in joy, delight, and happiness. He slaughtered sacrifices and gave gifts, and stayed in it with pleasure of life. The arrival of his confirmation in Damascus reached him, so he increased in thanks to the Lord of Creation.\nHowever, the people of Damascus are in distress from high prices, miserliness of merchants, corruption of the free, weakness of the small, and lack of crowding of the great. Judgment is for Allah, the One, the Subduer. For a rotl of Damascene meat became a piastre, a rotl of ghee a piastre and a half, a rotl of buffalo meat twenty-four masari, fish likewise, a rotl of camel meat eighteen masari, an ounce of rice a masriyyah, honey an ounce for a shahiyya. A rotl of bread six masari, and people are in the worst conditions.",

    "text": "In those days, a house in Bab al-Sarija collapsed on a woman and a small boy. In those days also, a Kurd and his wife were killed in the Suq Saruja district. The reason for that was he was a pilgrim, and when he came he found her changed in her conditions. Then it turned out she misbehaved in his absence. He was possessing strength (?) and beauty, so he slaughtered her and did not care about anyone.\nIn those days also, a man killed his daughter in the Suq Saruja district. She was four years old. Her matter reached His Excellency As'ad Pasha, that this girl's mother was divorced and her maternal aunt, her father's wife, did not love her, so she insinuated some words against her to her father. Her father had a great deal of stupidity and madness, so he beat her painfully with a stick, then tied her to a tree in his house. She remained tied all night until morning. He came to untie her and found her dead. It was a night of severe cold. As'ad Pasha summoned him and ordered him to be beaten severely. He was beaten then put in irons after taking much money from him.\nOn Wednesday, the eighth of Safar al-Khayr of this year, Sheikh Muhammad Abu Qamis al-Kurdi, Sheikh of the Muradiyya Madrasa, passed away. He was named Abu Qamis (Father of a Shirt) because if he wore a shirt he would not take it off until it tore. This is the utmost asceticism. He was fasting and praying night prayers. Notables and grandees went out in his funeral due to their belief in his righteousness. He was buried in the Marj al-Dahdah cemetery. When his room was opened, they found with him twenty new linen thobes, fifteen half-pieces, seven qintars of firewood, ten rotls of rice, a pot of ghee, a pot of honey, and other provisions. They found a pot with quarter riyals and similar masari, and in it gold, goods, needs, and two sacks full of shirts. They found about a hundred books they valued at a great price. Look at the asceticism of such a one; the good has gone with the bad.\nOn Friday, the tenth of Safar, Sheikh Ibrahim, Imam of Al-Qashmasiyya, passed away. He was a righteous jurist, buried in Bab al-Saghir cemetery, may Allah have mercy on him.\nOn Friday, the twenty-second of Rabi' al-Awwal, the skilled scholar Sheikh Ahmad al-Harasti, Secretary of Fatwa in the Imadi house, passed away, may Allah have mercy on him.\nIn those days, a man sold a jar of oil to another man, received its price after weighing it; then carried it to the man's house and said: Keep this jar with you, in an hour I will come to you and empty it for you. He said: No harm, rather I will empty it and whenever you come you find the jar. Then the oil owner went. An hour later the buyer emptied it, and found in it four ounces of oil and the rest clear water. He sought the man but did not find him.\nOn Saturday, the last of Rabi' al-Awwal, a Kapikulu killed a Sharif man in Ma'dhanat al-Shahm. He stabbed him with a dagger in his chest which came out of his back, and left the dagger stuck in him, until a judge viewing him took it out. Then they arrested the killer. The Ashraf rose. The killing was proven against him, so they imprisoned him in the Citadel, and that night they strangled him.\nOn Wednesday, the first of Jumada al-Ula, Sheikh Muhammad bin Sheikh Shu'ayb, famous as Sheikh Jina, residing in Bab al-Sarija district, passed away. He, may Allah have mercy on him, was smiling, gentle, of utmost righteousness. He was buried in Bab al-Saghir, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nOn the eighth of Jumada al-Ula, a wretched man from Salihiyya known as Al-Fustuqi was assassinated. He was, as said, a dark calamity and a great disaster, brave repelling a hundred braves with a stick, a thief whose like was not heard among thieves famous for tricks. Among his tricks and cleverness which no equal was heard of, is that when he put his hand on the top of a wall, as soon as his nail caught it, he was on top of it, and the amazing thing is that his back is to the wall. If put in any place and the door closed on him and locked, he came out of it whatever it was. All this and he did not exceed twenty years of age. Then he aggressed against the people of Salihiyya especially and others, and his matter exhausted them. They set a reward for a person to kill him. So he assassinated him after befriending him, killed him, and he went as if he never was.\nOn Tuesday, news came to Damascus that on the eve of Monday, the governor of Baalbek, Emir Hasan, was killed. He was leaving the mosque, and three persons assassinated him, shot him with three guns and fled escaping. He was carried to his house. The second day he died. It was said his killers were his brothers, since he has seven brothers, and Allah knows best.\nIn those days, the Governor of Damascus As'ad Pasha imposed on Za'ims, notables, and merchants to bring him wheat from the city of Hama, and its wage be from them. Some of them went and brought much wheat. A ghirara was sold for thirty-one piastres. We did not benefit except its existence, as for high prices, it remains in all items as we presented its pricing.",

    "text": "On the eve of Saturday, Musa Kikhiya of As'ad Pasha, Governor of Damascus, passed away and was buried in Bab al-Saghir near the hill of Al-Shaghour. He had a great funeral. He, may Allah have mercy on him, was humble, sought knowledge in his early days, had compassion and kindness, and loved asking and reconciling disputants, until Damascus and its surroundings, even Bedouins, became obedient to him. He left three children: one became Governor of Jerusalem, the second Governor of Gaza, and the third small from his Damascene wife. He remained in the Kikhiya position from the rule of Sulayman Pasha to the seventh year of the rule of his nephew As'ad Pasha.\nOn Monday, the twenty-second of Jumada al-Thani, two Turkmen shepherds were killed in the land of Ghouta in Al-Mahfara. One of them survived, and was asked who did that to them. He informed that some Maghrebis thought they had money. So after they inflicted that upon them, they found with one a quarter riyal, and the second a few flus. So they returned losing this world and the Hereafter.\nIn those days, As'ad Pasha enlarged his new house, the like of which was not made, nor done, nor found in existence. While carpenters were raising scaffolds to raise the ceiling, eight carpenters fell and were crushed. Praise be to Allah, none of them was killed. His Excellency the Pasha ordered them sent to their homes, and gave each one half a gold coin.\nIn that year, As'ad Pasha, Governor of Damascus, bought from Salihiyya, land of Al-Inaba, and elsewhere, lands and orchards. He also bought Suq al-Daqq and shops around it, intending to make them a Qaysariyya having no equal in the Qaysariyyas of Damascus.\nOn Friday, the remnant of the Righteous Salaf, the belief of the people of Damascus absolutely, Sheikh Abd al-Latif bin Abd al-Hadi passed away. His lineage was read when prayer was established for him in the Maqsura of the Umayyad Mosque, and thirty grandfathers were found between him and our master Umar bin Al-Khattab. He had a great funeral and was buried in the cemetery of Marj al-Dahdah, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nOn Monday, the last of Jumada al-Thani, the Yetmiş Iki (Seventy-Two) regiment of Kapikulu entered. Everyone with a wrapped turban went out to meet them, with two hundred Tafakjis and a group of Dalatiyya, all by order of the Pasha. It entered with an Arada, i.e., a procession, not [even like] the Noble Hajj procession. People went out to watch, men, women, old and young. They decorated the Amara neighborhood for them with lamps and torches. They entered with pride, arrogance, and insolence. We ask Allah Almighty for well-being.\nIn those days, the Sublime State sent asking His Excellency As'ad Pasha for camel rennets and ginger roots. Immediately His Excellency the Pasha fetched from the Arab al-Jabla three she-camels that ate nothing but their mother's milk. They were slaughtered and their rennets extracted. His Excellency As'ad Pasha sent them with the ginger roots with three pregnant she-camels accompanied by three eunuchs.\nIn those days, news reached Damascus that Sa'd al-Din Pasha, who is As'ad Pasha's brother, oppressed the people of Aleppo. He raised prices, and demanded two hundred purses of piastres from them, because the Sardariyya of the Hajj Jarda was directed to him. They refused to give him, a great dispute occurred, Friday prayer was cancelled, and a group of them was killed. The next day, a rotl of bread was ten masari, he called it out for four masari. Meat was thirty the rotl, he called it out for twelve masari. The notables of Aleppo sent a petition to the Sublime State about what happened. We did not know what would happen after.\nIn early Sha'ban of this year, news reached Damascus that Ibn al-Harfush, Governor of Baalbek, the famous Mutawali Rafidite, arrested the Mufti and his brother, burned them with fire, demolished their house, and cut their vineyards. This malicious Harfush family, may Allah curse it, had years ago also killed Sheikh Yahya, Mufti of Baalbek, famous for knowledge and generosity.\nIn those days, a man hanged himself in Yilbugha Mosque on a tree in it at night. People woke up and found him hanged, and the reason was not known.\nIn those days, a garden gate fell on a man in Salihiyya called Sayyid Ibrahim al-Halwani from the Suwayqa neighborhood. They carried him to his house, and he died the second day.\nThe first of Ramadan of this year was Saturday, confirmed at the sixth hour of the night.\nOn Monday, the third of Ramadan, the Agha of Kapikulu was killed in the Citadel after Asr. The one who killed him was one of his group by the planning of one of the two dismissed Aghas, because Damascus has three Aghas for Kapikulu: one employed who was killed, and the two dismissed ones turned against him in envy, assassinated him, and his blood went in vain. Muhammad Basha bin Shams was also killed in Wadi al-Qarn and his killer was not known.\nOn the sixth of Ramadan, the Surra Emini entered Damascus. Eid was Monday and fasting complete.",

    "text": "In this year, many Persian pilgrims came. They are, according to what they reported, one thousand six hundred Persians, besides Baghdadis and Arabs. This brought comfort to all people in buying and selling. With the Persians came gold rupees, each for thirteen piastres, large and small pearls, stones, minerals, shawls, and other things.\nThe Mahmal left on Thursday, the eighteenth of Shawwal, and the Hajj left on Friday after repeated calls that no pilgrim should spend the night except outside Bab Allah. The Mutasallim and Baltajiyya left after Asr, and people at night, and the rest on Saturday morning. This is something unprecedented to our knowledge.\nIn Shawwal during these days, severe unbearable heat occurred, until springs and wells dried up. The Bayt Ras canal, a village of Babbila on the road to Qabr al-Sitt, sank, dried up, and was obliterated, as if it never was. Following the drying of springs and lack of water, an increase of water came, until water became like tahini.\nOn Wednesday, the eighth of Dhu al-Qi'dah, a man was publicly shamed, said to be forging fake coins. He rode a donkey backwards, his face blackened with soot, tools of work on his chest, and they circled him through the entire city. Despite this, high prices reached their limit: a rotl of meat for twenty-six masari, rice for ten masari, bread for five masari, to the end of what we presented.\nIn the middle of Dhu al-Qi'dah, the Governor of Aleppo Sa'd al-Din Pasha, brother of As'ad Pasha Ibn al-Azm, arrived in Damascus, Sardar to the Hajj Jarda, and departed with it on Thursday, the first of Dhu al-Hijjah.\n\nYear 1165\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and sixty-five entered on Saturday. People rejoiced at its arrival, as on the eve of the crescent heavy rain fell, and they rejoiced, planted, and tilled. Prices began to drop, except that rulers and faces need to inspect creation with mercy and kindness. Hoarders are many, notables silent, and rulers eating. To Allah we belong and to Him we return. Look at the high prices: This year approached with its bounties and blessings, yet a rotl of bread is four masari, dibs four rotls less a third for a piastre, a rotl of ghee a piastre and a half, a rotl of onions four masari, a rotl of garlic seven masari, a rotl of charcoal four masari, and measure on this. The rich are enjoying and the poor are patient.\nThe historian, may Allah forgive him, said: On Monday, the tenth of Muharram of this year, a decree arrived from the Sublime State that His Excellency Khalil Effendi al-Bakri became Judge in Damascus. They registered the decree, and his son As'ad Effendi al-Bakri sat in his place until his father's arrival as will come.\nOn Sunday, the twenty-second of Muharram, the Jukhadar of the Noble Hajj arrived, announcing about the Hajj all good, and that the Hajj stood at Arafat on Friday. This is the ninth of the consecutive pilgrimages of His Excellency As'ad Pasha. This never happened to another, and praise be to Allah who gave him.\nThe next day, the Treasury of Egypt entered Damascus. The historian said: With it was our relative the Sheikh of the Sa'diyya in the Egyptian lands, Sheikh Yahya Effendi al-Jabawi, brother of Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jabawi al-Shaghuri from his father.\nOn Tuesday, the first of Safar al-Khayr, was the entry of the Syrian Hajj caravan into Damascus. They saw no distress as they reported, except that they encountered in Hediyah large hail, each hailstone weighing sixty dirhams, but no harm resulted from it.\nIn those days, it reached us that the people of Egypt expelled every stranger, and whoever they found afterwards they looted his money and tortured him severely.\nIn early Rabi' al-Awwal, Khalil Effendi al-Bakri entered as Judge of Damascus. Some rejoiced and some grieved, thinking he brought matters of change, alteration, and inspection, but none of that happened.\nOn the eve of Wednesday, the sixteenth of Rabi' al-Awwal, the glorious scholar, Sheikh of the Shafi'is in Damascus, nay Sheikh of Sheikhs of the virtuous among its eminent scholars, our Sheikh and teacher Sheikh Ali Kuzbar passed away. We prayed over him Dhuhr prayer in the Umayyad Mosque, and he was buried in the cemetery of Bab al-Saghir south of Aws bin Aws al-Thaqafi. Before his death he made a will. Among what he willed was fifty piastres to repair the graves around his grave. This was a karamah (miracle) from him, because at the hour of his burial many graves collapsed from the crowding of people surrounding his funeral. May Allah Almighty have mercy on him, and return upon us from his blessings.\nOn the eve of Tuesday, the last of Rabi' al-Awwal, Sayyid Muhammad son of Sayyid Ahmad, servant of Sidi Abu al-Darda', was found slaughtered in his house inside the Citadel. He had a slave and a Mamluk, and no trace was seen of them. It was said they killed him, and Allah knows best, and he went as if he never was.",

The prayer over him was attended by our Governor, ruler of Damascus As'ad Pasha al-Azm, its Judge Khalil Effendi al-Bakri al-Siddiqi, its Mufti Hamid Effendi al-Imadi, its current Naqib Muhammad Effendi al-Ajlani, Ali Effendi al-Muradi, notables of Damascus, and many people. He was buried in the cemetery of Marj al-Dahdah, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nThe second day, the glorious scholar Imam of the two niches belonging to the Shafi'is, Sheikh al-Masri, passed away. He was the one who brought the Samarmar water, and loved fulfilling needs for Allah's servants. He was buried in Al-Dahdah cemetery, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nOn the first of Jumada al-Thani, Hasan Chalabi bin al-Safarjalani passed away. He was among the leaders in Damascus. On this day, three Sheikhs of guilds died in Damascus: Sheikh Abd al-Qadir Sheikh of sweet-makers (Halwaniyya), Sheikh of barbers Usta Muhammad al-Bushi, and Sheikh of Kavuk-makers (Qawaqjiya) Usta Muhammad.\nOn Thursday, the third of Jumada al-Thani, hail fell in Damascus. One was weighed and came to seventy dirhams. This year has abundant rains, bounties, and blessings. A grain of wheat sprouted twenty-two stalks/ears. Someone even reported to me that a grain of wheat sprouted on the roof of his house, and he found it after transplanting it to be twenty-two stalks i.e., ears. Despite that, everything is expensive: a rotl of ghee in days of its abundance ten ounces for a piastre, dibs three rotls for a piastre, onions five rotls for a piastre. Everything according to prices we presented, and judgment is for Allah.\nIn this period, His Excellency Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha bin al-Azm, Governor of Damascus, paved the Maydan road from Bab al-Musalla to Bab Allah, and did not oppress anyone with that nor take anything from anyone.\nIn early Rajab, the Prince son of Zahir Umar, ruler of Tiberias and Acre, arrived. His Excellency As'ad Pasha received him through Musa Kikhiya, bestowed a robe on him, honored him, and comforted him regarding his father, because there were matters between him and his father Zahir Umar, so the Pasha reconciled them.\nIn those days, Khalil Effendi al-Bakri, the aforementioned Judge, built the minaret above the Maristan.\nIn these days, a Kapici came from the Sublime State summoning Sayyid Muhammad Effendi al-Muradi to appear before His Excellency the Grand Sultan, and to be brought honored, and to give him forty purses. He was given the mentioned sum and carried in a Roman litter. The notables and grandees of Damascus presented him with great gifts of mounts, money, and luxurious clothes. The notables went out to bid him farewell with His Excellency the Governor of Damascus Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha al-Azm. His departure from Damascus was on Monday, the ninth of Rajab the Unique of this year.\nIn these days, Ahmad Effendi, Diwan Effendi of the Pasha, passed away. He is the one who built the palace in the Ahmadiyya wall in Suq al-Arwam. He died without child or heir. It was said his estate reached seven hundred purses, mostly gold cash. His Excellency the Pasha took them, and Allah does what He wills.\nIn those days, the waters of the Shaghour district were disrupted. Much money was imposed on its owners. They complained to His Excellency As'ad Pasha, Governor of Damascus, may Allah preserve him. He ordered that nothing be taken from anyone, rather he ordered paying fifteen hundred piastres from his treasury to fix the water and run the stream.\nThe historian Al-Budayri, may Allah Almighty forgive him, said: I went out to visit Sayyida Zaynab with my son Mustafa, reciting Allah's words on our way, until we reached the Lady and entered her shrine. We viewed the building constructed by Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha al-Azm in it this year. He made inside the harem two palaces, an Iwan, eastern chambers, utilities, and other things that immortalized his mention there. We found His Excellency the Pasha's cousin Mustafa Bey, may Allah preserve him, had decorated its walls and ceilings and improved its structure, and began building the bath in this year while we were there. May Allah Almighty reward them both for this charitable work with the best reward, Amen.\nOn the first night of Sha'ban, His Excellency Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha traveled to the Dawra. On the second night of his travel, a woman was killed in the early night between Al-Suwayqa district and Qabr Atika district, and her killer was not verified.\nRamadan was proven Thursday. The Deputy of Politics was Musa Kikhiya, and the Judge of the city was Khalil Effendi al-Bakri. Prices of bread and others as you see: a rotl of bread three, four, and five masari, a ghirara of wheat twelve piastres, a rotl of meat twenty masari, a rotl of rice ten masari in its season days, dibs three and a third rotls for a piastre, an ounce [of oil?] a masriyyah and a piece, a rotl of onions eight masari, firewood a rotl a masriyyah, oak a qintar one hundred ten masari.

Their owner shouted, so some political aides caught him, he gave him some gold and he let him go.\nIn this month also, a man carried his son, and on his head were some dinars. A thief followed him until the carrier of the child entered an alley, snatched the dinars and skullcap and went.\nOn the eve of Saturday, the tenth of Ramadan, after the doorman of the Umayyad sanctuary closed the doors, he slept. The muezzins came and knocked on the mosque door. He got up to open for them and found his clothes missing. He informed them, so they entered, closed, and searched the sanctuary all of them, but found no one. The strange thing is all doors were closed. Then they went towards the tomb, and found eight silver lamps missing and one gold lamp, and no adversary was known for them.\nOn the seventh of Ramadan the Blessed, the Surra Emini procession came from Istanbul.\nOn Thursday in the middle of Ramadan, His Excellency Vizier As'ad Pasha entered Damascus while he was absent in the Dawra.

He was shot in his house in Qabr Atika, and his killer was not known.\nOn Sunday, the seventeenth of Shawwal, As'ad Pasha al-Azm, may Allah preserve him, departed with the procession of the Noble Mahmal. It was the tenth year of his consecutive pilgrimages with the Syrian caravan as Amir and for Damascus of the Levant as Vizier. On that day the Aleppo caravan came, and two days before it the Persian caravan came, which was small compared to the year before. They stayed in Al-Kharab and Al-Suwayqa. On the nineteenth of Shawwal, the Syrian Hajj caravan marched from Damascus in safety intending the Sacred House of Allah.\nAfter days, His Excellency Muhammad Agha the Mutasallim called out regarding meat, a rotl for eighteen masari, nailed a group of butchers, accepted neither bribe nor gift, and was just in his rule, may Allah Almighty grant him success, until the poor began praying for him openly. After a while, he priced all goods and was strict, and began taking the hand of everyone who complained to him. May Allah reward him with good.\nIn that year charcoal was hoarded. The Mutasallim inspected and priced, but that availed nothing. No one reached charcoal except the strong like Kapikulu and Dalati. The Mutasallim found no helper in this regard.\n\nYear 1166\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and sixty-six entered on Tuesday or Wednesday. May Allah make it a year of good, blessing, and mercy upon us and upon all Allah's creation.\nOn its first, i.e., first of Muharram, a judge from the sons of Turks named Salih Mulla entered for Damascus. He stayed in the house of Ali Agha bin al-Tarjuman near Bab al-Qal'a, and judgment from the old court called Al-Kubra ceased.\nIn those days, the tower of the Citadel fell, taking the whole wall from its door, and so on to the end of the tower from the Qibla side. No one was killed except a man from the Citadel.\nIn those days, rain fell like mouths of waterskins for three consecutive days, destroying most raisin drying grounds and ruining threshing floors.\nIn these days in the first ten of Muharram, the Mutasallim of Damascus hanged three persons from thieves on the grape vine tree in Al-Marja in front of the Takiyya gate.\nIn the middle of Muharram, glad tidings came to Damascus: a decree confirming His Excellency Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha as Governor of Damascus.\nOn the eve of Monday, the eve of the twentieth of Muharram, the Mutasallim hanged a thief in Al-Suwayqa and cut off the hand of a pickpocket man.\nAt the end of Muharram, the Jukhadar's writer came, and reported that the Hajj in this year went and returned via the road of Al-Far'i.

The Noble Hajj entered on Tuesday, the fifth of Safar. The Amir al-Hajj As'ad Pasha entered with the Mahmal procession on Wednesday.\nIn the middle of Rabi' al-Awwal, the ruler warned that broken flus and lead ones should not circulate. The next day, the crier called out regarding sound flus, every twelve for a masriyyah after they were every twenty-four for a masriyyah, and that only the Constantini should circulate. People faced great distress, and most of the city closed down. Then the ruler's crier called out every twenty-four for a masriyyah, returning them to their first state.\nBut praise and favor be to Allah, people are in safety and security, cheapness and prosperity in all goods except meat, for a rotl is twenty-eight masari. As for others, a rotl of bread three masari and two and a half, a ghirara of wheat fifteen piastres or less. On this, praise be to Allah, you can measure.\nOn the third of Rabi' al-Thani, the righteous servant Sheikh Mustafa al-Kurdi, from the sons of Turks and Afghans, speaking Turkish, Kurdish, and Afghani, passed away. He was of amazing righteousness, always armed with full weapons, carrying them night and day, not sleeping except carrying them. If he entered the bath, he entered with full gear. He spoke little, not speaking to anyone. Sometimes he would speak and curse in Turkish. On the day of his death, he had a great funeral, and was buried in Marj al-Dahdah, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nIn those days of this year, His Excellency As'ad Pasha began building the Qaysariyya in Al-Bazuriyya, whose equal is rare in the world.

They all died, may Allah forgive them. Strangely, these four, each one's name was Muhammad, which is a strange coincidence. They were buried in one day.\nAt the end of Rabi' al-Thani, an adolescent boy tied a mare's halter to his belt, and sat performing ablution at the river of Al-Qadam village at Qubbat al-Asali. The mare panicked and began running with the boy tied to its halter, dragging and kicking the boy until it reached Bab Allah. They caught the mare and found the boy crushed, cut, and dead. The boy was the son of Ahmad Basha al-Sahhar al-Qubaybati, and the mare was his father's. They informed His Excellency As'ad Pasha, may Allah preserve him, and he ordered his burial, and did not harm anyone.\nIn those days, the Treasury of Egypt came and stayed for days then traveled. In those days, thieves looted the shrines of Companions and Saints. On the first of Rajab, they uprooted the window of Sidi Bilal al-Habashi, took its iron, a brocade cloth that was on his coffin, two pieces of silk, two rugs, and other things. They took the window of Sheikh Abd al-Jabbar son of Sidi Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani, his shrine is west of Bab al-Saghir. The cloth of the coffin of Sidi Ubayy south of Sheikh Arslan's cemetery was taken.\nOn the second of Rajab of this year, His Excellency Vizier Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha, Governor of Damascus, headed out wanting to raid the Arabs of Al-Balqa. He took with him from the village men, the peasants, one thousand one hundred peasants. He brought soldiers from Homs, Hama, Ma'arra, Druze Mountain, Matawila, Nablus, Jerusalem, and Safed, besides the Sardiya Arabs and others. He went out with great wealth. Markets closed those days, women were prevented from going out, and matters became grave.\nThen during this month, news arrived that His Excellency the Pasha marched with the army to above Al-Balqa, entered a place called Al-Wkr, defeated Ibn Adwan and his Arabs, and the army looted them completely. The Pasha went to the Dawra from there.\nIn this year, Ramadan was proven by sighting, so we fasted Monday. On the eve of the tenth of Ramadan, the Pasha came from the Dawra, and the army came with the Kikhiya two days later.\nIn this month, a stranger pilgrim was lost in Khan al-Haramayn in Bab al-Barid. They accused a man from the sons of Turks, a Ghalyanji, arrested him, tortured him, took his money, and released him. In this month, many killed men and women appeared and no one asked about them. Everything is available and high prices play in all goods. Damascus was filled with all types of creation, and most places became full. Eid al-Fitr was Wednesday.",

This sedition was because of a man who became a Kapikulu and they did not accept or approve him. Markets closed, bullets were fired, and they wounded each other. The matter was not resolved except by invalidating the man from the Ojak, and dismissing the Odabashi and Usta.\nEid al-Adha this year was Sunday. News appeared in those days about changing the Sultan and the coming of Ahmad Pasha Ibn al-Qaltaqji. The Kapikulu were confused and disturbed, then it appeared the matter was a lie with no basis.

We ask Allah Almighty for a good end.\nIn the middle of Jumada al-Ula, a confirmation came to Mustafa Pasha brother of Sa'd al-Din Pasha bin al-Azm for Sidon. No healing news came to his brother As'ad Pasha regarding the rule of Damascus, and the wait prolonged for him. High prices in everything, even soil, cinder, stones, iron, wood, and other building materials. With total effort one gets a master or carpenter, the wage of one is a dinar and not found. Lime and adobe are not found, and so on. Breaths are constricted, things exceeded measure, and the Pasha and those around him collect money in purses. He called out for meat and it was not found, called out for soap and it dissipated, called out for oil. He had purposes, matters, and rulings that crush the liver. Help is sought from Allah, the Single, the Eternal.\nOn the nineteenth of Jumada al-Ula, news appeared that a woman killed her husband with a group of wretches, claiming he sleeps with his Mamluk and not with her. After killing him, they buried him in the house corridor. The victim belonged to the Kurds, had a coffeehouse in Suq al-Khayl, and his name was Darwish Agha.

But high prices exist in goods and others as we mentioned, so no return or repetition.\nIn these days, Mustafa Pasha, brother of As'ad Pasha al-Azm, was separated from Sidon and the Wilaya of Adana was directed to him. In those days, the Qanawat river was cut off after the Raisin Festival. In mid-Muharram, the Judge of Damascus Muhammad Effendi came from Istanbul. In these days, they nailed a baker at Bab al-Jabiya.\nOn the twenty-seventh of Muharram, the Hajj Jukhadar Al-Dali Ali Bash entered with a group, and announced the news that His Excellency the Pasha and pilgrims are safe. On Tuesday, the writers of Hama and Aleppo came. On Wednesday, a Christian came with some letters, and reported that the Damascus writer was wounded by Arabs. In those days, the sky brought rain like mouths of waterskins, until people thought the Hajj had drowned. It was at the station of Al-Sanamayn. The entry of Hajj was delayed from its time about a week.\nOn Tuesday, the twelfth of Safar, the Noble Hajj entered. The next day, the Amir al-Hajj and Governor of Damascus Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha al-Azm entered in the procession of Hajj and the Noble Mahmal. This is the fourteenth year as we presented of his consecutive years of Hajj which was not known for another. May Allah perpetuate the days of his existence, Amen.",

    "text": "In this year, His Excellency As'ad Pasha reconciled between the people of the Noble Medina and the Arabs who besieged it, after giving them about one hundred purses of money. All pilgrims thanked him for this deed, may Allah Almighty reward him with all good, Amen. In this year, a decrease also occurred in camels and people. They reported that in the station of Abar al-Ghanam (Sheep Wells), more than one thousand seven hundred souls died in one day from intense heat (Shawb). In another station (Qonaq), seven hundred souls, besides those who died gradually.\nIn these days, measles (Humayra) occurred among children in Damascus, and many of them died.\nOn Monday, the thirteenth of Rabi' al-Awwal, His Excellency the Sultan gifted His Excellency the Amir al-Hajj As'ad Pasha with a Kapici Bashi a caftan and a great sword with a great Firman containing much honoring for the referenced Vizier.\nOn the eve of Friday, our Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jabawi al-Sa'di al-Shaghuri, Sheikh of the prayer rug (Sajjada) of the Sa'diyya Order and administrator of the Umayyad Mosque, passed away. He had traveled to Istanbul and met three Sultans: Sultan Ahmad, Sultan Mahmud, and Sultan Uthman. He received good and favor, after a secret and proof appeared for him. He left many successors in Rum, Egypt, Aleppo, and Damascus. He reached a great status with total humility, sitting in coffeehouses and greeting the big and small. The day of his death was a witnessed day, and he was buried at his grandfather Sheikh Hasan al-Jabawi, may Allah have mercy on him.\nAt the end of Rabi' al-Awwal of this year, which is the year one thousand one hundred and seventy, the Judge of Damascus died and was buried in Bab al-Saghir, and had a great funeral.\nOn the seventh day past of Tishrin al-Thani (November), heavy rains fell, followed by severe cold and dry wind, until waters froze in pools and basins, trees dried, and rocks cracked. It continued for some twenty days. Lemon, citron, bitter orange, and other trees dried up. It continued some twenty days, until you find them in roads like rocks. Many wild animals, dogs, and birds died. It reached me that a person had chickens, and in one day twenty-two chickens died despite protecting them. As for the wilderness, do not ask what ice and cold did in them; much livestock and sheep died. Many children and women of the Arabs died. It reached me that the Norias of Hama stopped, and mills too, and markets closed. In summary, a terrifying cold, disturbing freeze, and terrible ice, perhaps not heard of for years.\nThe historian Al-Budayri, may Allah forgive him, said: On Thursday, mid-Rabi' al-Thani of this year, Damascus was directed to Raghib Pasha, separated from the city of Aleppo. On the eve of Wednesday, the last of Rabi' al-Thani, news came with a messenger (Najjab) to His Excellency Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha, Governor of Damascus, that he was dismissed and appointed to Aleppo. The second day of his dismissal, he sent for his Mutasallim Musa Agha, dressed him in a precious fur, and set him up as Mutasallim of Damascus. He showed that news came from the State to be Kikhiya of Raghib Pasha, to handle matters of Hajj and Dawra, and that glad tidings came that after the end of the Hajj year he is Governor of Jeddah and Pasha with two Tughs. So Musa Kikhiya received the rule of Damascus.\nAs'ad Pasha released everyone in the prisons. There were many in prisons from four, five, and ten years. As'ad Pasha stayed in Damascus frequenting the Government Saraya until Friday, the fifteenth of Jumada al-Ula. A Kapici came to him with the Firman of rule in the city of Aleppo, and glad tidings of two Tughs for Musa Kikhiya, and that Raghib Pasha separated from Aleppo has attained the Grand Vizierate and headed to Istanbul, and that Damascus was directed to Hussein Pasha bin Makki residing in the city of Gaza.\nAl-Hajj As'ad Pasha stayed until Monday, and departed in safety heading to the city of Aleppo, after ordering the reform of the two Ojaks, and to place in every junction a group of Janissaries and a group of Kapikulu, and to place over them in every station (Qulla) an Onbashi. News spread that the coming Governor to Damascus is of bad character, unjust and tyrannical. The Kapikulu feared the Janissaries and all the entourage of As'ad Pasha. They began engaging in gossip. Some fools from the people of Al-Haqla and Al-Maydan rose, but their elders turned them back. Great fear and rumors occurred in the city, until the Kapikulu vacated their houses, and shop owners vacated their shops from all markets.\nThe first ruling of Musa Kikhiya the Mutasallim was ordering that all Manazil (guardhouses?) in the neighborhoods from twenty or thirty years be built by the people of their district. The city was disturbed a disturbing disturbance. On that day, the Pasha hanged a young man from the boys of Al-Suwayqa called Ibn Sumratayn, so tremors decreased and people felt safe.",

    "text": "On Tuesday and the eve of Wednesday after Maghrib, news spread reaching the Saraya that Ahmad al-Qaltaqji, who was among the heads of the Zarbawat who fled and rebelled in the Druze Mountain as we mentioned before, attacked Damascus on the eve of Wednesday. What an ominous night for the people of Damascus from the abundance of fear, terror, sleeplessness, and evacuation of houses and shops that overwhelmed them. Barricades were lined up in all gates. It was a night, from its terror, like the Night of Resurrection. The people of Damascus did not taste sleep in it at all, waiting for the break of dawn. When it appeared to them, they found nothing of what they imagined, and the news was false.\nOn Thursday, the fifth of Jumada al-Thani, with Dhuhr Adhan, was the entry of Hussein Pasha bin Makki to Damascus, separated from the city of Gaza which is his homeland. He entered with a great procession full of Effendis, notables of Damascus, Janissaries all cavalry, and Kapikulu all infantry, in complete gear, adorned weapons, and comprehensive decoration. Commoners and creation stood praying for him, shouting and seeking help from the oppression of Damascus notables and high prices.\nThe next day, Effendis and notables came to the Saraya to greet the Pasha. People and commoners stood in their way. When they passed them to enter the Saraya, the commoners rose with screaming and clamor, shouted at them and said: Go back, no blessing of Allah upon you, you are hypocrites and help rulers in oppressing the poor and needy. They increased in cursing and insulting them, and stoned them with stones. It became a disturbing situation. So the Pasha opened the door of justice and inspection of the subjects, until a rotl of bread became three masari. Then he busied himself with injustice like his predecessors, so prices returned to their first state: like a rotl of bread for five and six masari, until a freeze came, which is painful severe cold, leaving no fruit in the month of Adhar but burning it. On the tenth of Rajab, a freeze occurred the like of which was not heard, destroying what remained if anything remained of fruits.\nOn the seventeenth of Rajab, Wednesday, the glorious scholar, the Faradi (expert in inheritance law) Sheikh Abdullah al-Basrawi al-Shafi'i, the erudite of his time in every art especially the science of inheritance, passed away and was buried in the tomb of Sheikh Arslan, may Allah have mercy on him. In this noble month also, a man was killed in Al-Maydan, and three slaughtered persons were found in the Baramika cemetery. On the twentieth of Rajab, the Maghrebis attacked the Pasha, then shot at the commoners, killing about ten men and burning places. In these days, two slaughtered women were found in the hill of Bab al-Saghir. In this month also, sedition occurred between Maghrebis and Levend Kurds. About fifteen men from both sides were killed, Damascus closed down, then it ended in reconciliation.\nOn the twenty-seventh of Rajab, Hussein Pasha, Governor of Damascus, hanged a man from Al-Maydan accused of Haram (immorality/theft?), who had previously killed his mother by slaughtering.\nThe historian Al-Budayri, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, said: In these days, news came that Al-Hajj As'ad Pasha bin al-Azm, Governor of Aleppo, received a Firman to march to Egypt as Governor. The people of Aleppo rebelled with him, and said we want no other, and wrote to the Sublime State about that. Then after days, the confirmation of Aleppo came for As'ad Pasha bin al-Azm, and for his brother Sa'd al-Din Pasha the position of Marash, and for his brother Mustafa Pasha the position of Mosul. Each one went to his position, and Mustafa Pasha sent his harem and children to Damascus.\nIn early Sha'ban, His Excellency Hussein Pasha, Governor of Damascus, went out to the Dawra, and set up Hussein Agha Alay Bey of Sipahis as Mutasallim in his place. He was just, did not oppress, and did not transgress against anyone. Before the Pasha's departure, he ordered the two Ojaks to reconcile and leave corruption and obstinacy, and handed over to them the lands and servants. He stationed Mustafa Agha al-Za'faranji, elder and chief of Kapikulu Tafakji Bashi, at the Saraya gate, after he guaranteed upon himself the reform of the city.\nRamadan entered on Thursday, and with it entered the greatest high prices in Damascus in all items. A ghirara of wheat reached fifty piastres, a rotl of bread from seven masari to twelve masari, after the highest bread was three masari a rotl. A rotl of rice fourteen masari, dibs likewise, onions also. A mudd of lentils, likewise chickpeas, mung beans, kidney beans, and bulgur thirty masari. A mudd of barley twelve masari, an ounce of garlic two masriyyahs. In summary, everything is expensive with lack of means and lack of movement.",

    "text": "On the eve of Monday, the twelfth of Ramadan, a great sedition occurred between the Janissary Corps and the Kapikulu Corps, the likes of which had not been witnessed for a long time. The Dalatiyya, Kurds, and Mosulis aided the Kapikulu. Each group besieged a neighborhood. Victory belonged to the Janissaries after they fired cannons at them from the Citadel for two days and a night. A group of commoners and a few Janissaries were killed. However, many of the Kapikulu and their followers were killed after they besieged the Bab al-Sarija neighborhood, took possession of it, and destroyed some houses and shops therein. They also besieged the al-Shaghour neighborhood, to the point that they were on the verge of taking it, when the Naqib Hamza Effendi and some Sheikhs came and reconciled between them. Then, after the third day, they differed again.\nOn the twentieth of Ramadan, Hussein Pasha, the Governor of Sham (Damascus), arrived from the Dawra (tour of duty) but did not make a move. Eid al-Fitr was on Wednesday.\nIn the first ten days of Shawwal, Mustafa Agha bin Ali Effendi al-Daftari arrived from Istanbul with the rank of Agha over the Janissaries. He entered in an 'Arada, meaning a procession, never before witnessed in the Damascene state.\nOn the nineteenth of Shawwal, Hussein Pasha bin Makki, the Governor of the Janissaries [sic: likely implies he had their support or was Governor of Damascus], departed as the Amir of the Noble Hajj, after all the Janissaries and Kapikulu marched with him. Before his departure for Hajj, he had gathered the Aghas of both factions, reconciled them, and wrote a binding document against them in the presence of the Qadi, the Mufti, and the city's notables. Its content was that anyone who transgressed would owe one hundred purses to the Sultan's kitchen and his blood would be shed with impunity. The city calmed down and became like a cup of milk, and not the slightest disturbance occurred.\nThe peace remained until Sunday, the thirteenth of Dhu al-Hijjah, when a Kurd named Wali arrived. He was from the group of As'ad Pasha bin al-Azm, the current Governor of Aleppo. This Kurdish man had a history of oppression and aggression against the people of Sham. The Janissaries and the commoners rose against him and said, \"Kill him!\" He fled to the Citadel and sought protection with the Kapikulu, who protected him.\nBefore the Pasha's departure, the people of Sham had risen with one voice saying, \"We do not want a stranger in our town.\" The Pasha issued a Buyuruldi (decree) for them stating that no stranger/irregular soldier (Gharib Yigit) should remain in Sham. Some left after the Pasha's departure, while others remained. When this man arrived, the commoners and notables were harmed by him. They sent him a message to leave voluntarily to save his blood. He refused to leave Sham, emboldened by the fact that he had taken refuge in the Citadel with the Kapikulu. Immediately, the city closed down, the Janissary Aghas gathered, followed by the commoners, and they rose up fully. The Anatolians (Anatabiya), Kurds, and Dalatiyya gathered. The Kapikulu rose, and the people of al-Amara rose with them. They raided al-Darwishiyya and exchanged fire with the Janissaries until night fell. They attacked the Janissary warehouses filled with timber and burned them; they were worth several purses of money. The Janissaries rose against the people of al-Amara, displacing its inhabitants, women, and children to the Umayyad Mosque, then set fire to it and its markets until it became an open plain.\nThe situation intensified for the people of al-Amara due to the oppression and aggression of the Janissaries. The boys of al-Haqla from al-Maydan aided them with Jahili zeal, along with some Druze men. They opened the city gates—something never witnessed before now. The Kapikulu attended and returned, charging against the Mosulis, Baghdadis, and Dalatiyya, besieging them, and killing occurred between the two factions.\nOn the eve of the fourteenth of Dhu al-Hijjah, the moon eclipsed, a terrifying eclipse. On the twenty-second of Dhu al-Hijjah, an earthquake occurred in Damascus, not witnessed for years. It continued for several days and nights. This was after the sun had eclipsed so that stars were seen during the day. Yet this nation would not take heed.",

    "text": "This sedition lasted for days, fluctuating between peace and rumors, until a council (Diwan) was held by the Aghas and notables of Sham. A decision was made to expel the 'Gharib Yigit' (strangers/mercenaries) from Sham, and that Wali, who was the cause of the sedition, must leave. The Aghas expelled them, accompanied by Ali Effendi al-Muradi to appease the people of the town. They continued escorting them outside the town. The Aghas and Effendi al-Muradi returned, but the fear remained as it was. Then, the people of every neighborhood began keeping watch every night.\nThe situation remained like this until news reached Sham that those who had left had looted villages, killed souls, and violated harems. The government sent papers to the people of the countryside and villages to kill or expel them. They banded against them and expelled them, but only after they had killed and looted. Then they saw a Kapici (messenger) on their way, so they stripped him and killed some of his group.\nThe people of Sham remained amidst fear and terrors until Monday, the twenty-seventh of Dhu al-Hijjah, when news reached Sham that Musa Pasha, the Pasha of the Jarda (relief column), upon reaching al-Qatrana, was attacked by Arabs who stripped him and looted the Jarda and everything in it. They even stripped him of his clothes and the ring from his finger, brought him down from his litter, and rode in the litter in his place, taking his drums, standards (Tughs), and cannons. Their leader was called Qa'dan al-Fayez.\nThen the group that was in the Jarda scattered. Some returned to Sham, some were cut off in Hauran, some fled to Gaza, some to Jerusalem, and some to Ma'an with the son of Musa Pasha, because it was close to the place where the Jarda was looted. As for the Pasha, he returned to the village of Da'el and stayed there for a number of days. They sent a litter to carry him, but found he had died. They carried him and brought him to Sham. His entry into the town was at the beginning of the night, and the next day they buried him in the tomb of Sidi Khumar, may Allah be pleased with him.\n\nYear 1171\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and seventy-one entered, and we are in this state. We ask Allah Almighty to change our condition to the best condition.\nIn this month, Muharram al-Haram, the erudite scholar, the seal of the Hadith scholars and remnant of the righteous predecessors, Sheikh Salih al-Jinini, the great Muhaddith under the Dome of the Eagle in the Umayyad Mosque, passed away. He had a great funeral and was buried in Bab al-Saghir. May Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nIn those days, a second Jarda went out, inferior to the first Jarda. On the twenty-seventh of Muharram, the Jukhadar of Hussein Pasha, the Governor of Sham and Amir al-Hajj, entered, accompanied by three camel riders riding pillion, and with them the brother of Ibn Mudayyan, Sheikh of the Arabs of Hijaz. The people of Sham rejoiced and decorated the markets with lamps. The Kapikulu rose, went out, and fired upon the subjects, causing a strong tremor. Sedition remained in the town between the Janissaries, the Kapikulu, and the Ashraf. The Kapikulu killed about thirty men from the Ashraf, fired upon the Umayyad Mosque, and killed Sheikh Umar Kabab, the mosque's muezzin, as he was descending from the Dhuhr call to prayer. Some children were also killed therein. Chaos ensued in the city markets for days. Then the Aghas and Effendis intervened between them for peace, but they refused. They said to them, \"Stop the fighting and wait until Hussein Pasha comes from the Hajj and decides on these rulings.\" So they stopped the fighting.\nThe Kapikulu remained in the Citadel, neither moving nor shifting, until Monday, the seventeenth of Safar al-Khayr. While people were disturbed by the delay of the Hajj's arrival and did not know the reason, news came to Sham that the Hajj had been stripped and looted by the Arabs. The Arabs robbed the women and men of their wealth and belongings. The world clamored, people wept, and Sham turned dark.\nIt reached the people that six letters had come to the Mutasallim (deputy governor) to send reinforcements to the Hajj, but he did not reveal them. The commoners rose and attacked the Mutasallim in the Saraya (palace) and stoned him. The Mawali (judges) and Aghas gathered and called for bringing animals out of the town, and to bring out items, clothes (tailored and sewn), sandals, and slippers, and for men to go out to meet the Hajj. A large crowd went out. Their exit was on Friday, the twenty-first of Safar al-Khayr. This was after they wrote a petition to the State informing them of this situation, and sent to Homs asking Hassan Pasha bin al-Kibrli to come to protect Sham.",

    "text": "On Thursday, the twenty-fifth of Safar al-Khayr, some Janissaries of Sham approached from the direction of the Hajj, accompanied by pilgrims, riding two or three on a beast, in the utmost state of destitution. The crier with them held a white banner, calling out, \"This is the banner of the Janissaries.\" The people clamored with weeping and wailing. Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs. They reported that behind them were a multitude of pilgrims, along with women and girls, including the Queen, barefoot and naked.\nTwo days later, the Chorbadjis (officers) of the Janissaries approached from Muzayrib, accompanied by the Mashtaji and the Qaftaji, all stripped. On that day, the Janissaries and those remaining of the welcomers returned, accompanied by the Aghas and the Mutasallim Hussein Agha Alay Bey. They reported on the conditions and terrors that befell the pilgrims, men and women, from the evil of the infidel Arabs, without doubt; for these deeds done to the pilgrims are not done even by fire-worshippers. They reported that they would strip a man and search under his armpits, his anus, his mouth, and under his testicles. If they found a man with a large belly or a hernia (Qila), they would slice his belly and rip open his hernia. They inserted their hands into the anuses of men and the private parts of women. A woman would place mud on her front and back to cover her nakedness, but they would uncover it. In short, acts were committed by the Arabs that have never been heard of in ancient times, nor from idolaters or cross-worshippers. None escaped the stripping except those who fled ahead of the Hajj.\nThe Pasha ordered those around him to loot his treasury, so they looted it. Some survived, some were killed, and some were stripped repeatedly. Then the pilgrims stayed for fourteen days in hunger and thirst, with no water and no provisions. Some died of hunger, thirst, cold, and heat, after some had drunk the urine of others. The oppression of the Arabs was not enough; the oppression of the people of Ma'an was added to it. May Allah be angry with them, curse them, and prepare for them the torment of the Fires.\nOn the ninth of Rabi' al-Awwal, news came that Hussein Pasha, the Governor of Sham and Amir al-Hajj, was in the city of Gaza and wanted mules, musketeers, and men from Sham. They refused to send him anything of that sort, but rather sent word to him to come to his post because the Kapici with the decree was with them, and to do what he saw as being in the [best] interest.\nDays before that, Ahmad Basha bin al-Qaltaqji, the leader of the Zarbawat (thugs) of Sham, had arrived. He had been a fugitive for fourteen years. He came once during As'ad Pasha's absence for Hajj and did what he did, as we mentioned earlier. He came a second time at the beginning of the rule of the mentioned Hussein Pasha, who honored him and gave to him, and he went out with him to Muzayrib, and from there he disappeared. He returned this third time when the sedition occurred in Sham. They forbade them from those actions, but it was of no avail, as previously mentioned.\nOn Friday, the thirteenth of Rabi' al-Awwal, news reached Damascus that Umar al-Mahamid, the Sheikh of Hauran, found the Mahmal and the Sanjak (flag) with the Arabs. He satisfied them until he redeemed them from them. He found the Mahmalji (Mahmal keeper), the son of the Qabaq Dar, and four or five men in a state of humiliation and brokenness.\nOn Tuesday, the twenty-sixth of Rabi' al-Awwal, the Mahmal arrived and entered Sham, carried on a camel, covered with its green inner cloth. With it were Muhammad Basha al-Saqbawi, some Druze horsemen, and some Bedouins. They mentioned that they redeemed it from the Arabs for one hundred and seventy piastres.\nA Tatar (courier) had arrived in the middle of Rabi' reporting the death of Sultan Uthman, but he did not bring word of whose name the Khutba (sermon) should be given in. So Sham delivered the Khutba without a Sultan's name for two Fridays, until Monday, the first of Rabi' al-Thani, when a Kapici came with the Khutba in the name of Sultan Mustafa Khan. May Allah support him and support the Ottoman dynasty throughout the ages.\nThen the pilgrims began arriving in groups. Then the Baltajiyya (axe-men/guards) came, accompanied by the Qadi of Medina and some women. The women who were present that year were counted, reaching five hundred women; no trace of them appeared, along with the Queen, the Sultan's sister.",

A strong sedition occurred, then the Kapici, the Mawali (judges), and the Aghas reconciled between them, and the fighting ceased.\nOn the twenty-fifth of Rabi' al-Thani, the Qadi of Medina who came with the pilgrims passed away. Pilgrims began dying one after another, until many of those who were with the Jarda died, because what happened to the Hajj and the Jarda this year is something unheard of, making bodies shiver. To Allah we belong and to Him we return.\nDamascus remained without a governor until the end of Rabi' al-Thani, when the news was confirmed, after people's hesitation regarding the matter of Sham's rulers, of the appointment of the Wilaya (governorship) of Sham to His Excellency the Grand Vizier Al-Hajj Abdullah Pasha al-Shataji. His entry into the city of Damascus was in the forenoon of Sunday, the twenty-eighth of Rabi' al-Thani. The notables and dignitaries of Sham went out to meet him. He entered in a procession the likes of which had not been witnessed for others. He entered with a dragging army; he had forty banners of Dalatiyya, fifty banners of Levend, and twenty banners of Arnaut (Albanians).\nThen, the next day, he held a Diwan (council) and robed the Mufti, the Qadi, the Naqib of Ashraf, and Sayyid Ali Effendi al-Muradi. The Pasha sent for a group of Janissaries, but they did not respond. So he sent a crier to announce that the people of honor should move away from among the Janissaries. Nothing was seen but the moving of furniture and the emptying of houses and shops.\nAt the first entry of the Pasha into Sham, the Janissaries gathered, numbering about twenty thousand or more. They displayed courage and lack of fear of him, saying: \"We do not account for him, even if his army is double ours.\"\nOn the eve of Wednesday, a group of Janissaries gathered in the Suwayqa neighborhood. They began shooting and frightening people, until the people of Sham closed the gates. When day broke, they attacked towards Bab al-Jabiya and shot towards the direction of the Saraya gate. Their matter reached His Excellency the Pasha, Governor of Sham, and he became extremely enraged. The Mawali came and he held a Diwan. Then the Pasha sent demanding the rebellious wretches from them, while the people of honor would remain as they were. The hearts of the Janissaries hardened, they strengthened themselves, and thought they were the victors.\nThen the Pasha shouted to his soldiers and rode out himself, seeking the direction of al-Maydan. No one stood before him. He and his army attacked them, and none of them stood firm. He and his army continued striking with the sword until they reached outside Bab Allah. They killed a great multitude of them. Those they did not want to kill, they took and put in chains. The soldiers looted al-Maydan, leaving neither big nor small except killed or captured. They left no house, shop, woman, or child without employing looting, captivity, and violation of honor, including stealing women's jewelry and looting virgin girls, and other things that blind the eyes. They wished for death... [text unclear/corrupt: al-darrar?]. They had never seen such terrible atrocities. The people of Sham suffered a calamity that year not witnessed since the days of Timur (Tamerlane). The outcome of affairs belongs to Allah.\nThe next day, Thursday, the Pasha's group rose to loot, but he forbade them and ordered the collection of the looted items from the soldiers and others, to be placed in some mosques. He ordered a crier to call out: Whoever has looted property, let him come, identify it, and take it. They took some, but most was lost. As for the Pasha's followers, anyone they saw, they killed him, cut off his head, and left him in the markets, alleys, and houses. They recorded the houses that were looted, and they came to about twenty-four thousand houses. As for the shops, they were countless in number or calculation. Most grievously, the Zawiya of the house of Sheikh Sa'd al-Din al-Jabawi in al-Maydan, where they had placed precious goods, was checked afterwards and absolutely nothing was found in it. The soldiers began pursuing the Janissaries to the villages, hamlets, and deserts, killing and capturing even children and women. Oppression increased in the land, the servants feared, and corruption multiplied. They gathered many heads of Ashraf and commoners and sent them to the State.",

    "text": "The Pasha ordered the Imams of the neighborhoods to be brought, and ordered them to write that everything looted and robbed had been returned by the Pasha immediately, and not even a cord was lost from anyone. He made them seal this petition with this condition. This was a ploy from him, and they could not disobey his command.\nThe Pasha's group continued to loot, oppress, transgress, and tyrannize, respecting neither elder nor youth, saying about the people of Sham: \"You are all infidels, Christians, and evildoers.\" He would feed his group nothing but meat, rice, and good bread, until meat became scarce and no bread was found to be eaten. At every bakery were hundreds of hungry people, until most of the town's people became impoverished and began begging from people. Misery increased, and prices rose the rise of a cunning tyrant: a rotl of rice became twenty-four masari, bread the same, dibs (molasses) the same, an ounce of ghee eight masari, an ounce of oil four masari, a ghirara of wheat seventy-three piastres, a ghirara of corn forty-eight, a ghirara of chickpeas sixty piastres, a ghirara of lentils thirty-five, barley fifty, an ounce of sumac four masari, a rotl of onions four masari, and so on by analogy. There is no power or strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Great.\nAfter a number of days, the Pasha cut the expenses of some troops and banners, so they began raiding the villages, looting wealth, honors, and children. Do not ask likewise about the Pasha's soldiers, for they looted orchards, broke trees, and stripped humans. Despite that, the Pasha was not pleased with that; often he treated them with discipline and painful beating, but they did not desist until he started killing some of them. The people of Sham wanted to fight them, but found no one to take their hand, and the notables of Sham did not speak good. The command is for Allah.\nIn these days, the Pasha exiled the Naqib of Ashraf, Hamza Effendi, to Jerusalem. After a while, a Firman came with a Kapici stating that Abdullah Pasha al-Shataji, Governor of Sham, has delegated authority to do what he wants without consultation. Then he moved for the Dawra (tour) travel. He ordered the extraction of the two cannons at the Citadel gate—they had not been taken out for years and years. He made carriages for them and iron rings; their weight with the wood reached thirty-three qintars. He went out with them seeking the Dawra travel. He made 'Shawahi' (light cannons) like small cannons and mounted them on the backs of camels to turn right and left. Then he ordered the commoners to drag the large cannons; two men died and a group was crushed.\nHis group imposed money on the neighborhoods and markets, and collected it in haste. When the Pasha went out to the Dawra, his Mutasallim hanged a man. Some of his aides brought a Sharif man and said: \"This one shot with the Janissaries.\" Immediately he ordered him strangled without consulting anyone. One oppresses and this one tyrannizes. Calamity and high prices increased. At every baker's shop sat one of the ruler's aides due to the intense crowding of creatures and the abundance of women and children. You could hear weeping and wailing from them that cuts hearts and livers. The command is for Allah because it is His will.\nIn those days, news came of the killing of As'ad Pasha bin al-Azm, the former Governor of Sham. Days later, a Kapici came from the State to seal his palace, seize his wealth, seal the houses of all his followers and aides, seize their wealth, and raise them to the Citadel. Distress increased, and matters and terrors occurred in Damascus the likes of which had not happened in past times. Then the followers of Ibn al-Azm As'ad Pasha came, and the Kapici entered the Saraya. He brought out great buried treasures from his palace; lo, they were like hoards deposited therein. They extracted from the ground, walls, ceilings, basins, and even the latrines, dirhams, dinars, precious goods of inestimable value, jewels, and other things known only to Allah Almighty. Judgment is for Allah, the High, the Great.\nOn Thursday, the fourth of Ramadan, the Pasha came from the Dawra and entered Damascus. On the seventeenth of Shawwal, Abdullah Pasha al-Shataji went out for the Noble Hajj with a great procession and a dragging army.\nIn that year, Sheikh Ahmad al-Manini al-Hanafi, the preacher of the Umayyad Mosque, passed away, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nA great torrent came during the summer forty days (Marba'aniyyah), falling on the village of Jubba near Yabroud. Its descent was at the beginning of the night. It took only an hour to sweep away the village of Jubba completely. Then it passed over Yabroud, covering all the vineyards, demolishing, and killing. Then it reached the village of al-Nabk, roaring in its flow like thunder, destroying much therein. We ask Allah Almighty for kindness in what is destined.\n\nYear 1172",

    "text": "Then the year one thousand one hundred and seventy-two entered. Its first Muharram was Tuesday. The Mutasallim in Sham on behalf of Abdullah Pasha was Sulayman Agha, who was reportedly unjust and tyrannical. The arrival of the Hajj Jukhadar was at the end of Muharram al-Haram. The Sardar of the Jarda was Abd al-Rahman Pasha, Pasha of Tripoli.\nOn the fifth of Safar al-Khayr, the Noble Hajj entered Sham. It was a year of comfort for all pilgrims, due to the fact that the Pasha had killed countless Arabs between the Two Holy Sanctuaries, even killing the Sheikh of the Arabs. The confirmation of Sham came to the Pasha before his arrival in Sham.\nThe crescent of Ramadan appeared on the eve of Saturday. Cannons were fired in the last third of the night. Flus (coins) were twenty-four for a masriyyah. Eid al-Fitr was confirmed before noon on Sunday; they prayed Eid before noon, and people broke their fast after having been fasting.\nOn the sixteenth of Shawwal, Al-Hajj Abdullah Pasha al-Shataji headed out as Amir over the Hajj. He was accompanied in the Syrian caravan by Sa'd al-Din Pasha al-Azm as Governor of Jeddah. They took many troops with them, fearing the Arabs due to Abdullah Pasha killing their Sheikh and soldiers.\nOn the twenty-seventh of Muharram, the Jukhadar of the Noble Hajj arrived and brought good news. Abdullah Pasha al-Shataji dismissed the assistant of the Sharif of Mecca and set up his brother Ja'far in his place. The standing of the Hajj (Arafat) was on Friday. On Saturday, the seventh of Safar, the Noble Hajj entered Damascus, in utmost health.\nThen, after the entry of the Hajj, Abdullah Pasha ordered a crier to announce in Sham the lifting of injustice and aggression, and justice from rulers and subjects. He began disguising himself, hiding, and patrolling the streets and alleys of Sham. Comfort was achieved generally by the abolition of evils and the disappearance of people of immorality. The Pasha had cut the expenses of most of his soldiers and ordered their departure from Sham, and that no one should remain in it who has no work or craft. A large crowd departed, and he sent all his camels to Hama. That was from Allah's kindness to Sham and its people, though high prices continued as mentioned.\nThe Qadi of Sham was a righteous man, so he acted as a Muhtasib (market inspector) and began patrolling the market people himself, calibrating scales, rotls, and ounces. Whoever he found with deficient weights, he beat him soundly on his feet, and whoever he found with full weights, he gave him a silver masriyyah.\nRabi' al-Thani entered, corresponding to Tishrin al-Thani (November), and not a drop of water fell from the sky.\nOn the eve of Tuesday, the eighth of Rabi' al-Thani of Tishrin al-Thani of this year, in the last third of the night, while muezzins were in the minarets engaging in the 'Murasala' (pre-dawn calling), a light earthquake occurred, followed by a second, then a third. Damascus shook from them a severe shaking. The people of Damascus thought the Resurrection had risen. The tops of most minarets of Sham collapsed, along with many houses, mosques, and countless places. Even the Dome of Victory (Qubbat al-Nasr) atop Mount Qasioun was shaken and half of it thrown down. As for the villages of Sham, there was much destruction, and the dead found under the rubble were uncountable.\nOn the second night, it shook again at the time the first one shook, then it happened at the time of Fajr prayer and during the day as well. It kept repeating frequently but lighter than the first ones. Fear and calamity increased, and people abandoned their homes, sleeping in alleys, orchards, cemeteries, al-Marja, and the courtyard of the Umayyad Mosque. In this earthquake, the Khan of Qunaytra collapsed on everyone in it; only a few animals and people survived. Likewise, the Khan of Sa'sa'. News arrived in Damascus that some towns and villages collapsed on their inhabitants, so neither they nor their animals survived.\nThen on the eve of Tuesday, at the tenth hour of the night, the fifth of Rabi' al-Awwal [sic: likely means Rabi' al-Thani or subsequent month], the sky split, and screaming, rumbling, buzzing, and great terror were heard from it, such that some people of unveiling (Kashf) saw that the ceilings rose, stars appeared, and then the ceilings returned as they were. News arrived that in some lands two mountains closed upon some villages, so the villages disappeared and no trace of them appeared.\nOn the eve of Friday, the eighteenth of Rabi' al-Awwal [sic], at the time of Isha Adhan, a star/meteor fell from the sky from the west towards the east, illuminating mountains and houses. Then it fell, and a great sound was heard from it, louder than the sound of cannons and thunderbolts.\nIn the first earthquake, a huge rock fell into the Qanawat river blocking the river. Water was cut off from the town for eleven days. Stone cutters remained cutting it for eleven days. People were in two griefs: the grief of the earthquake and the grief of water scarcity.",

    "text": "On the eve of Monday, the sixth of Rabi' al-Thani, at the fifth hour, a massive earthquake occurred, greater than the first by degrees. A terrifying tremor accompanied it, bringing down most of the remaining minarets, throwing down the great dome of the Umayyad Mosque, the entire northern arcade, the Kallasa Madrasa, Bab al-Barid, the towers of the Citadel, and most houses of Damascus. What survived falling was scattered apart. Many people were killed, especially in the villages. Crowds moved to the orchards, mountains, cemeteries, and al-Marja. They pitched tents there and in the open fields, sleeping with their families and children. Despite that, the quaking and trembling did not cease, neither night nor day.\nThen Abdullah Pasha al-Shataji, Governor of Sham, may Allah Almighty grant him success, ordered a crier to call upon the people to fast for three days and to go out on the fourth day to the Musalla Mosque, for it is famous for the answering of prayers therein. People went out from every deep valley to the Musalla. His Excellency the Vizier went out with them, along with all notables, the Mufti, the Qadi, the scholars, the people of the Tariqas, Sufis, women, and children. They adhered to supplication in the Musalla for three days with clamor, weeping, and humility like the Day of Arafat, rather like the standing of Resurrection. The Most Merciful of the merciful had mercy on them and treated them with kindness and alleviation. The earth began to convulse lightly. People remained fearful in the orchards and open fields until snow and rain fell upon them, and frost occurred, until the earthquake lightened and people returned fearful.\nIn the middle of Jumada al-Ula, the Qadi arrived in Damascus; his name was Rida Effendi, and he did not move a motionless object. On the eighth of Jumada al-Thani, news appeared in Damascus that Abdullah Pasha al-Shataji, Governor of Sham, was dismissed. On the thirteenth of Jumada al-Thani... And on Thursday, the twenty-second of Jumada al-Thani, Al-Hajj Abdullah Pasha al-Shataji departed for the post of Diyarbakir, as it was said.\nOn the eve of Monday, the twenty-fifth of Jumada al-Thani, shortly before dawn, a light earthquake occurred in Sham, lighter than the previous earthquakes. Then news spread among people that a massive earthquake would occur. People panicked severely and returned to their previous state of fear, panic, and going out to orchards and cemeteries. We ask Allah Almighty for kindness.\nOn Monday, the first of blessed Rajab of this year, the Governor of Sham Muhammad Pasha al-Shalik bin Bulad Pasha entered Damascus with a great procession in the forenoon. Notables, dignitaries, Effendis, and Aghas went out to meet him. The Janissaries went out with horses, plated gear, and Davidian armor, and the Kapikulu went out with full gear.\nOn Saturday, the seventh of Rajab, Nu'man Pasha, Governor of Sidon, entered. He entered in a great procession. The Governor of Sham Muhammad Pasha al-Shalik went out to meet him, accompanied by Effendis, notables, and Aghas. The Governor of Sham hosted him at his place, and lodged every Agha of his Aghas with an Agha of the Pasha's Aghas. He stayed as a guest of the Governor of Sham Muhammad Pasha for three days and four nights, then departed for the place of his job and post in Sidon.\nIn the middle of the month of Rajab, a great wind came, lasting four days and nights, until it demolished many places. Only a few trees remained. The shaking from earthquakes did not cease night or day, along with the occurrence of high prices even in vegetables. A rotl of bread was five masari, a rotl of eggplant twenty-five masari, a rotl of onions nine masari, a rotl of meat a piastre and a quarter and was not found, a rotl of ghee a piastre and a half and a quarter. The rest as we presented. The historian Al-Budayri said: The poor person did not have even a 'minqir' (small coin), destruction is occurring from earthquakes at every time and moment, and people moved to the land of the peasants. Allah Almighty is the Helper.\nOn Saturday, the twenty-second of Rajab, a Kapici came from the Sublime State named Sabanikh Zade to inspect the Umayyad Mosque and the building of its dome, its northern side, and its minarets demolished in the earthquakes. With him was a chief architect, laborers, and men to commence the restoration of the mentioned mosque.\nOn the tenth of Sha'ban, the Governor of Sham Muhammad Pasha al-Shalik marched to the Dawra. He took with him Ahmad Basha bin al-Qaltaqji, along with Muhammad Agha bin Dali and Ibn Bakmaz, who were fugitives with Ibn al-Qaltaqji. When Muhammad Pasha and those with him reached Nablus, Ahmad Basha bin al-Qaltaqji died. He was buried there. His death was by plague, because the beginnings of the plague occurred lightly from the month of Jumada al-Thani, and continued increasing in Rajab and Sha'ban, as well as the existence of high prices as will come.",

    "text": "Then the blessed month of Ramadan entered on Thursday. Eid was on Friday. It became an Eid for the dead and the living, but more for the dead. Two days before Eid al-Fitr and two days after it, about a thousand funerals of those who died of plague would go out from every gate of the gates of Damascus every day, God forbid. This is something unheard of since the Plague of Amwas. We ask Allah Almighty for kindness in what the decrees brought. A shortage also occurred in fruit, until an ounce of Janarik (plums) was two masriyyahs, a rotl of apricots twenty-four masari, a rotl of mulberries eight masari, a rotl of apples twenty-four masari, a rotl of pears thirty masari, a rotl of garlic thirty masari, a rotl of onions seven masari, and meat and rice and others as we presented. The matter prolonged, oppression increased, joy vanished, hatred and evils increased, and man did not know where to turn from the intensity of weeping and aversion. To Allah belongs the outcome of affairs.\nOn Friday, the fifteenth of Shawwal, Muhammad Pasha al-Shalik marched with the Syrian caravan to the Two Noble Sanctuaries. Two days later, the Hajj marched with its equipment. Days later, Uthman Pasha, Governor of the city of Tripoli, Sardar of the Jarda, came. His stay during his residence was in one of the villages without regret or remorse. He marched traveling in Dhu al-Hijjah with the Kikhiyas of Sidon and Nablus.\nIn the middle of Dhu al-Hijjah, Sheikh Ahmad bin Sawwar, Sheikh of the Mahya, passed away. He was the erudite scholar of his time and age, possessing excessive courage and increasing proficiency in sciences. He had a great funeral and was buried in the cemetery of the grave of Sayyida Atika. After him, his cousin, the noble descendant Sheikh Sulayman, passed away. He used to perform the Mahya in the Umayyad Mosque and in Al-Bazuri Mosque in their neighborhood. In this month also, the erudite scholar, Mufti of the Maliki Masters, Sheikh Yusuf Effendi, passed away. He had a great funeral and was buried in Marj al-Dahdah. May Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\n\nYear 1173\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and seventy-three entered. Its first Muharram was Tuesday. Its entry was during intense heat. On the twenty-seventh of Muharram, the Jukhadar of the Noble Hajj arrived, and after him the Writer entered. He reported that this Hajj was extremely comfortable, and that Uthman Pasha, Sardar of the Jarda, performed charitable acts in his gift-giving (Hadiyah) that no one else had done. That is because when they met the Jarda, they found Uthman Pasha, Sardar of the Jarda, had preceded them and was residing in Hediyah waiting for them for eleven days. This never happened to anyone before him. He aided the pilgrims with honor; he fed the hungry, watered the thirsty, mounted the weary, and clothed the naked. Then when his good deeds reached the Sublime State, may the Master protect it from every affliction and calamity, they assigned him the Emirate of Sham, and assigned his son Muhammad Pasha the city of Tripoli.\nOn Wednesday, the twenty-seventh of Rabi' al-Awwal, a Kapici came with the dismissal of Muhammad Pasha al-Shalik from Sham and assigning it to Uthman Pasha, Sardar of the Jarda. In these days, restoration of the Umayyad Mosque commenced. Architects, carpenters, painters, and stonemasons entered it. They exerted effort in restoring the dome, the eastern side, and what fell of the minarets, and improving it all. It is not opened except at prayer time only. Construction is also busy in the Citadel and its restoration. The restoration of the Citadel was completed in the month of Rajab of the date's year. The restoration of the Umayyad Mosque, the northern side, the dome, restoration of minarets, and its improvement was completed in the month of Ramadan of this year.\nShortly before the month of Rajab, Uthman Pasha marched to the Dawra. He conquered the fortress of Tartura therein. That fortress was in the hand of Zahir Umar, and he killed such. When Uthman Pasha returned from it, Zahir Umar took it by the force of his army without siege.\nIn this year, rain is abundant, plague is excessive, epidemic exceeds the limit, fruit is very scarce, and high prices are rampant as we mentioned before: a single pomegranate for eight masari, an ounce of apples for seven masari, a rotl of charcoal for fifteen masari, an ounce of ghee for seven masari, an ounce of oil for three masari, and the rest of sustenance on this pattern as we mentioned before. As for Kaymak (clotted cream), a rotl became a riyal. The poor have no state left.\nOn the twenty-second of Sha'ban of this year, Uthman Pasha came from the Dawra and his conditions were happy. Monday, the blessed Ramadan was confirmed. On the third night of it, while people were in Tarawih prayer, a disturbing earthquake occurred. People cut the Tarawih prayer, fled, trampled one another, their minds were stunned, and their nargiles and some clothes were lost. The second night it happened also with imperceptible tremors.\n\nYear 1174",

    "text": "Then the year one thousand one hundred and seventy-four entered. Uthman Pasha, Governor of Sham, was in Hajj as its Amir. When the Hajj came, it was reported that this Hajj was among the most blessed of Hajj pilgrimages with prosperity, cheapness, and safety. In that year, a Kapici came ordering the Great Decoration. Uthman Pasha announced that whoever has a game/display, even if of mud and wood, or has knowledge of the arts of physiognomy/magic (Sima) called 'Mala'ib', he has extra honor with me. He spent a portion of money, gave and granted. Parades circulated with types of games, and all industries and crafts operated. They walked in numerous amazing processions; some with weapons, equipment, and luxurious armor, and some with expensive varied clothes. In summary, a decoration occurred the like of which we neither heard nor saw. In that year, Uthman Pasha, Governor of Sham, rode against Sahyun Fortress and conquered it, so the fearful felt safe and tremors decreased. In that year also, news came to Sham of the killing of Abdullah al-Shataji. The State seized his wealth and property, and he went as if he never was.\n\nYear 1175\nThen the year one thousand one hundred and seventy-five entered. The Governor of Sham Uthman Pasha was Amir of the Syrian caravan. It was a comfortable Hajj; no distress befell the pilgrims. The standing at Arafat was on Friday. Of strange coincidence is that Uthman Pasha left with the caravan on Friday, stood at Arafat with the Hajj on Friday, and entered Damascus on Friday. During his term, not the slightest disturbance occurred in Sham. He was just to the subjects, and the people of Sham lived a happy life during his term. His Kikhiya was Sulayman Bey, a Mamluk of Sulayman Pasha bin al-Azm. He had endured horrors at the death of the Azm family, so he attained hopes through his patience. In those days, news arrived in Damascus that Sa'd al-Din Pasha bin al-Azm died in Diyarbakir. The order came to seize his money. The State seized his money and took over his property. Trustworthy sources reported that a great amount of money came out of his estate. There is no power or strength except with Allah, the High, the Great.\n\nEnd of what Al-Budayri mentioned of this history. He abbreviated the events of the last years greatly and added a year by mistake. The correct is what we transcribed. Glory be to Him who is neither heedless nor forgetful.\nEnded what we edited by the pen of Muhammad Sa'id Abu Jamal, may Allah improve his condition and destination. That was shortly before noon on Thursday, the twenty-fourth of Ramadan, year 1317.\nThe book was completed by the hand of the poor servant of noble knowledge Muhammad, son of the late Sheikh Abd al-Qadir al-Majdhub in Maydan al-Hasa in Rajab al-Haram, year 1323.",
