    "text": "Introduction. In the name of Allah, and prayers and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah. To proceed: This is the second work of our project \"Encyclopedia of the Scholar, the Imam, the Reviver of the Era, Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani,\" which we have dedicated to collecting methodological issues from the heritage of the scholar Al-Albani, in addition to his words on the major international events he witnessed. We have named it \"Collection of the Heritage of the Scholar Al-Albani regarding Methodology and Major Events.\" The truth is that we do not present this work only to the people of our time, but we present it to history! The opinions and ideas contained in this book will remain - by the permission of Allah - a beacon by which generations will be enlightened as long as the heavens and earth exist. They will remain a witness to a rare experience of its kind, of a unique Imam whose like time rarely grants... He lived the concerns of his Ummah (nation) and merged with it, and his heart burned with grief over the weakness and feebleness that befell it... His eyes opened upon a lost generation of the sons of his Ummah... floundering between the darkness of doubts and desires... asking: Where is the way?!... and feeling for a glimmer of light to take their hands to where they should be, so that they may return their Ummah to where it should be! So Allah utilized him for them as an advisor and a guide, extracting the essence of decades of studying the Book of Allah the Exalted and the Sunnah of His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and contemplating the way of the Predecessors (Salaf), the People of Hadith, and the biography of the Imams of Islam throughout the ages, to enlighten the sons of his Ummah with a (Methodology) that would return them and their Ummah to a summit that the first generation had once ascended in times past, then those who came after them lost their path",

    "text": "and their way, so they fell a resounding fall... Al-Albani never claimed one day that this methodology which he set for the sons of his Ummah was from the figments of his own mind. Rather, he always declared that what he dedicated his life calling to is that straight line which the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, once drew for his Companions, and that what he dedicated his life warning against are those lines which the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, drew to the side of the first line, reciting the saying of the Exalted: (And this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way)! However, this methodology which the scholar Al-Albani laid out for the sons of his Ummah had not been gathered in its scattered parts and arranged in an independent book that would serve as a primary source for knowing it and viewing it, so that remained a barrier preventing many people from knowing the reality of his methodology. Then, it was from the grace of Allah the Exalted and His favor upon us that He facilitated the means for that, so the day came when we present this methodology in a new attire, after we collected the scattered words of the scholar Al-Albani regarding methodological issues from dozens of written and audio sources, then we arranged it in a coordinated order, so that this effort reaches you, dear reader, in this form that is in your hands.",

I praise Allah the Exalted for the acceptance He has decreed for the first work of this encyclopedia, \"Collection of the Heritage of the Scholar Al-Albani in Creed (Aqidah),\" among the scholars and students of knowledge. I have received dozens of messages on my private mobile and email from various countries blessing this work and encouraging me to complete it fully. So I thank everyone who corresponded with me and encouraged me to complete this project. I also praise Allah the Exalted for the benefit that has been decreed through the first work of the encyclopedia, \"The Collection of Creed,\" such that many brothers of different nationalities have translated scattered parts of it into several languages. I specifically mention among them my brother: Ahmed Abu Turab Al-Britani, for he had high aspirations in translating many parts of the encyclopedia into the English language, which he published on his blessed website (1). I ask Allah to bless him and his efforts. Also, parts of the encyclopedia have been translated into Indonesian, French, Spanish, Turkish, Albanian, Chinese, and others... Among the beneficial efforts for which I praised Allah for facilitating for students of knowledge and lovers of the scholar Al-Albani by documenting the issues transcribed from the tapes by minute and second, is that",

And praise be to Allah, first and last, outwardly and inwardly. Furthermore, many of those interested in the Sheikh's heritage have asked my permission, by contacting me or writing to me, to benefit from my effort in the encyclopedia, quoting from it, translating it, and so on. So I wanted to alert here that this work is fundamentally a charitable work aiming to serve the heritage of Sheikh Al-Albani and make it accessible. So I have no objection to my effort being benefited from in any way, provided that Allah is feared in quoting the words of the scholar Al-Albani or translating them correctly. For this reason, I personally uploaded a charitable copy of the \"Collection of Creed\" to the internet myself. Were it not that the expenses of the project are large and there is no sponsor for it, forcing us to print it as a commercial edition in small quantities to cover the expenses, I would have preferred for the encyclopedia to be printed in charitable editions and distributed for free to students of knowledge, Islamic centers, and entities interested in the Sheikh's heritage.",

I had explained in the introduction to the \"Collection of Creed\" the method I followed in compiling this encyclopedia, and I mentioned the sources I surveyed for that, elaborating on my methodology therein. It suffices me here to draw attention to some important aspects specific to the \"Methodology Collection\": 1 - I was about to write an introductory preface to the term (Methodology/Manhaj) and its implications, as I noticed that the term 'Methodology' is surrounded by much confusion in understanding it, especially among those who constantly mention it and attribute themselves to it!! But I decided to postpone that to the study section. 2 - There is a connection in many topics between the Methodology Collection and the Creed Collection. The Methodology Collection is considered complementary to what was mentioned in the Creed Collection regarding these topics. For example: - We dedicated the Sheikh's words on the sects opposing the creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah in the Methodology Collection, while the discussion on their beliefs had previously occurred in the Creed Collection in scattered places. We cited a number of Sufi beliefs in the chapters of Tawhid (Monotheism) and Shirk (Polytheism), just as we cited a number of beliefs of the Murji'ah and Khawarij in the chapters of Faith and Disbelief, and a number of beliefs of the Jahmiyyah, Mu'tazilah, and Ash'aris in the chapters of Names and Attributes, and a number of beliefs of the Jabriyyah and Qadariyyah in the chapters of Decree and Predestination, clarifying the error of their beliefs and refuting them. So what we mentioned of discussion regarding these sects in the Methodology Collection is considered complementary to what is mentioned in the Creed Collection regarding these sects.",

Then I settled on adding it to the Methodology Collection because it appeared to me that the Sheikh's methodological principles were reflected in his opinions on these major events. The Sheikh's opinions on political action were reflected in his view of the Algerian issue, and his opinions on issues of Jihad were reflected in his view of the Afghan issue and the Second Gulf War, and so on.",

I hope that this work, which I labored to collect, arrange, and produce, will be a key to goodness for everyone who views it from the sons of our religion, whatever his methodology or orientation, and however great the distances between us and him. Nothing drove us to produce this work except mercy and compassion for people whom we reckon have not stood upon what we have stood upon of what we believe to be the truth. Here we are today presenting them with something of that, perhaps Allah will unite us on a common word... And perhaps this work will also be a key to goodness for brothers of ours who transgressed against us and against the sons of our religion, and exceeded the limits of Allah regarding us and them, and appointed themselves - without right - as judges over those who attribute themselves to Islam and the Sunnah... Even though they have undeniable efforts in spreading the correct Creed, defending the creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah, and refuting deviant ideas, along with other scientific and da'wah efforts that no one denies except an ingrate, yet they followed a path that the scholar Al-Albani often warned against. Thus, they deviated with the Da'wah and led their students into a dark tunnel with no end. - They are people for whom the Salafi Da'wah, which is the green garden of Islam that we hope the people of Islam will shade themselves in from the scorching heat of Shirk, innovations, and superstitions... has transformed in the hands of these people into poisoned arrows, each of them trying to strike the liver of his brother, never missing him... - People for whom the ways of speech have narrowed, and the doors of knowledge have closed in their faces, so they resort",

    "text": "of knowledge a crossroads: either he chooses for himself the path of seeking knowledge, research, induction, exploration, inspection, serving the heritage of our Ummah and Imams, supporting the People of Hadith and Athar, and defending the Sunnah and its sanctuaries... Or he engages in hateful partisanship and narrow loyalties, or occupies himself with tracking people's faults and diminishing the people of knowledge and virtue, or loiters in the cafes of Tabdi', or wastes his life on websites of insults and disparagement... Not to mention his broad chest in accepting his students' disagreement with him, nay, encouraging them to do so. How often we disagreed with him - and disagree with him - even though we do not match him in knowledge, status, experience, and practice, yet he accepts that from us with his welcoming chest. How many gatherings he holds to discuss with his students some issues, ending the gathering by saying: This is your opinion and this is my opinion, or this is what appeared to me but perhaps I will reconsider the issue, in a bright image of the breadth and flexibility of the Salafi Call. Where is this compared to the method of those who appointed themselves guardians over us and our Call, and their state with their disciples is: I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the path of right conduct. I ask Allah to reward him with the best reward, to prolong his life, bless his work, knowledge, and call, preserve him from before him and behind him, grant him a good ending, and gather us with him in His Paradises.

Praise be to Allah alone, and peace be upon His servants whom He has chosen. To proceed: I have looked at some parts of the \"Series of Verification of Hadith Manuscripts That Have Not Been Published Before\" undertaken by the blessed young man and loyal brother Dr. Shadi bin Muhammad bin Salim Al-Nu'man - may Allah preserve him and extend his life in obedience, benefit, and blessing. I praised Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He created among our brothers, our Call, and our students someone who carries this high ambition and noble goals. I remembered what Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbali - may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him - described the knowledge of the people of Yemen with, for he said in \"The Virtue of the Knowledge of the Predecessors over the Knowledge of the Successors\" (p. 57-58): \"The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, testified for the people of Yemen regarding faith and jurisprudence. The people of Yemen are the least of people in speech and expansion in sciences, but their knowledge is beneficial knowledge in their hearts, and they express with their tongues the amount needed of it, and this is jurisprudence and beneficial knowledge.\" End quote. Indeed, whoever looks at the works of this young man whom Allah has honored with high ambition, a sharp mind, and persistent patience - and I do not purify him before Allah the Exalted - knows that he has combined two goods: blessing in knowledge, and abundance in production. Yes, how much the former left for the latter, and how great is Allah's blessing upon His servants, and how many are the good metals in this Ummah, that blessed Ummah, which is like rain; it is not known whether its beginning is better or its end.",

    "text": "Does Methodology enter into Creed or Rulings? Intervention: Here are two questions: First Question: Does Methodology (Manhaj) enter into the chapter of Creed (Aqidah) or into the chapter of Rulings (Ahkam)? Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. The Sheikh: We are not concerned in answering this question with terminological matters that have arisen and arise especially in this time. I say as he, peace be upon him, said in the hadith of the Sermon of Need (Khutbat al-Hajah) which I mentioned previously, and in it he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, says: \"And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family,\" and in another narration: \"And the best Hady (guidance/way) is the Hady of Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family.\" So the guidance of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, must be taken as a whole; we do not differentiate between the end and the means; because the means leads to the end which Allah, Mighty and Majestic, legislated. If there are means that the Messenger, peace be upon him, clarified to the Ummah and commanded them to adopt or encouraged them towards, then it is not permissible for us to invent new means opposite to them, even if these means are from permissible matters, but we adopt them as a means to call the Ummah to Islam generally or to Islam in its details which the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, brought. We know that in this time new concepts have emerged which people adopted... to bring people closer to Islam, and they adopted these means as if they were ends they adhere to, claiming that they bring them closer to Allah. They adopt means, for example: from modern games which the lands of Kufr (disbelief) have been afflicted with; because they are the ones primarily intended by the saying of Him, the Blessed and Exalted: {They took their religion as amusement and diversion and the worldly life deluded them} [Al-An'am: 70]. Some Muslims followed the path of these people, to whom playing with these new games that came to us from the lands of Kufr, who have no religion but amusement and play, was made attractive. So some of those who belong to some Islamic parties adopted them",

This was not from the guidance of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. Rather, his guidance was calling the youth, the elders, and all people to worship Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, alone with no partner, and reminding them that there is another life, either lasting bliss or Hellfire and blaze; and that is according to righteous deeds or evil deeds, as the Exalted said: {As for he who gives and fears Allah * And believes in the best [reward] * We will ease him toward ease} [Al-Layl: 5-7] meaning: Paradise, {But as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need * And denies the best [reward] * We will ease him toward difficulty} [Al-Layl: 8-10] which is Hell. This is how the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, used to remind his companions of Paradise and Hell, and make that a means to bring them closer to the worship of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted. Today, some means have been adopted by some people in imitation of those disbelievers whom the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, warned us against imitating in many authentic hadiths known to all those present, Allah willing. Among them is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, as in Sahih Al-Bukhari: \"You will follow the ways of those before you, span by span and cubit by cubit, even if they entered a lizard's hole, you would enter it. They said: O Messenger of Allah? The Jews and the Christians? He said: Who else among people?\" And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said in the authentic hadith in Musnad Ahmad and others: \"I was sent before the Hour with the sword until Allah is worshipped alone with no partner, and my provision was placed under the shadow of my spear, and humiliation and lowliness were placed upon those who oppose my command, and whoever imitates a people is one of them.\" The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, while forbidding imitation of the disbelievers, encouraged Muslims towards something more sublime and higher than that, which is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"The Jews and the Christians do not dye [their hair], so differ from them,\" meaning: their gray hair, they do not dye their hair, so differ from them. Thus the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, was concerned that Muslims should not imitate the disbelievers, nay, that they should not share with the disbelievers in anything where they possess nothing but sharing. But the Messenger, peace be upon him, commanded dyeing hair to differentiate from them, meaning regarding the matter in which they cannot differ from them: gray hair,",

Everyone who reaches a certain age among humans will be afflicted with gray hair. So he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, commanded the Muslim, when gray hair streaks him, to dye it; because the disbelievers among the Jews and Christians do not dye their hair. He, peace be upon him, said: \"So differ from them.\" The hadiths commanding to differ from the polytheists are very, very many, and I have collected a good group of them in my book \"The Veil of the Muslim Woman,\" so whoever wants to expand in this field can refer to it. The point is that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, while forbidding imitation, added to that encouraging opposing the disbeliever. Opposition is broader than imitation; a Muslim might not imitate a disbeliever if, for example, he goes gray, because this is from the creation of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, but he can oppose the disbeliever by dyeing his hair. Therefore, he, peace be upon him, said: \"The Jews and Christians do not dye, so differ from them.\" If the keenness of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, reached this rank in encouraging Muslims to differ from the polytheists, then how is it permissible for some Muslims today to adopt some means that the disbelievers are upon to attract people to mosques, for example? The matter has reached such an extent with some of them that they introduced pictures into mosques, and even introduced some musical instruments in some countries in the name of softening the hearts of Muslims. Worse and more bitter than this in terms of deception upon people is what they adopted of means which they spread and many tapes were recorded with, which is what they call Islamic Nasheeds (songs). The accursed Iblis dragged them to this means at first by intonation and composing some of what they call Islamic Nasheeds with the meters sung by dissolute singers. This is how they started spreading these alleged Islamic Nasheeds. Then Satan dragged them and moved them from this first disobedience to another disobedience more heinous than the first, where they started beating tambourines and drums in what they call Islamic Nasheeds. Then Satan ascended with them until they introduced some other musical instruments which the dissolute people of the past did not know, but are rather instruments invented by the European",

They have fallen into the likes of what the disbelievers fell into before. When some wives of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, mentioned, when they returned from Abyssinia, they mentioned to the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, a church they saw in Abyssinia and mentioned the images and pictures in it. So he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Those constitute a people who, when a righteous man among them died, built a place of worship over his grave and made those pictures in it. Those are the worst of creation in the sight of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted.\" Thus, mosques today have become very close to Christian churches; in terms of their decoration and ornamentation, and in terms of singing in them what they call religious songs. I fear, greatly fear, that a day will come when unveiled women are allowed to enter mosques just as Christians do exactly in churches. We ask Allah, Mighty and Majestic, to suffice us against the evil of newly invented matters. This is what is easy for me to answer regarding that question.

Question: Some of the sitting brothers hear about the Salafi Call by hearsay, and read what is written about it by its opponents, not by its followers and callers. It is hoped from your virtue, as you are among the scholars and callers of Salafiyyah, to explain the position of Salafiyyah among Islamic groups today? Answer: I have answered a question like this more than once, but the answer must be given since the question has been raised. So I say: I say a word of truth which no Muslim can dispute after the truth becomes clear to him: First of that: To what is the Salafi Call attributed? Salafiyyah is an attribution to the Salaf (Predecessors). We must know who the Salaf are when 'the Salaf' is uttered among Muslim scholars, and consequently understand this attribution and what is its weight in its meaning and indication? The Salaf are: The people of the three centuries (generations) to whose goodness the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his family, testified in the authentic Mutawatir hadith extracted in the Two Sahihs and others from a group of Companions, from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, that he said: \"The best of people are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.\" These are the three centuries to whose goodness the Messenger, peace be upon him, testified.

    "text": "The First Matter: That this attribution is not an attribution to a person or persons, as are the attributions of other groups present today on Islamic earth. This is not an attribution to a person nor to tens of persons. Rather, this attribution is an attribution to infallibility; that is because it is impossible for the Righteous Predecessors to agree upon error. The same is not true for the Khalaf (Successors); for the Khalaf, no praise came in the Sharia for them; rather, dispraise came regarding their masses, and that is in the completion of the previous hadith, where he, peace be upon him, said: \"Then there will come after them people who testify but are not asked to testify...\" etc. the hadith. Just as he, peace be upon him, indicated that in another hadith in praise of a group of Muslims and dispraise of their masses by the concept of the hadith, where he, peace be upon him, said: \"A group of my Ummah will remain manifest upon the truth, unharmed by those who oppose them until the command of Allah comes, or until the Hour is established.\" This hadith specified praise at the end of time for a Ta'ifah (group), and the Ta'ifah is the small group, for in the language it applies to a single individual and above. Therefore: If we know this meaning in Salafiyyah and that it belongs to the group of the Righteous Predecessors, and that they are the infallibility if the Muslim adheres to what these Righteous Predecessors were upon, then comes the second matter I indicated just now, which is that every Muslim then knows this attribution and what it aims at of infallibility, so it becomes impossible for him after this knowledge and clarification to - I do not say to disavow, this is a self-evident matter - but I say: it becomes impossible for him except to be a Salafi; because we have understood that attributing oneself to Salafiyyah means: Attributing oneself to infallibility. From where did we take this infallibility? We take it from a hadith used by some of the Khalaf to argue contrary to the truth. They use it to argue for taking the opinion of the majority, what the masses of the Khalaf are upon, when they bring his saying, peace be upon him: \"My Ummah will not agree on error.\" It is not correct to apply this hadith to",

    "text": "the Khalaf today with the radical differences between them. \"My Ummah will not agree on error\" cannot be applied to the reality of Muslims today, and this is a matter known to every student of this bad reality. Added to that are the authentic hadiths that came clarifying what happened to those before us of the Jews and Christians, and what will befall the Muslims after the Messenger, peace be upon him, of division. So he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, said: \"The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians into seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will split or divide into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one. They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: It is the Jama'ah (Group).\" This Jama'ah is: the Jama'ah of the Messenger, peace be upon him. It is the one for which applying the previous hadith: My Ummah will not agree on error; can be decided with certainty that the intended meaning of this hadith is the Companions whom the Messenger, peace be upon him, judged to be the Saved Sect, and whoever followed their path and tended towards them. These Righteous Predecessors are the ones whom our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, warned us in the Noble Quran against opposing, and against following a path other than their path, in His saying, Mighty and Majestic: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115]. I draw the attention of our brothers on many occasions to the wisdom of our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, conjoining His saying in this verse: {and follows other than the way of the believers} to opposing the Messenger. What is the wisdom in that, given that if the verse were without this sentence, if it were as follows: \"And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination,\" it would have been sufficient in warning and reprimanding whoever opposes the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, and judging him with an evil destiny? The verse was not like this, but rather added to it His saying, Mighty and Majestic: {and follows other than the way of the believers}. Is this superfluous? Far be it for the speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, to be superfluous. Therefore: What is the purpose, what is the wisdom of conjoining this sentence: {and follows other than the way of the believers} to {opposes the Messenger}?",

    "text": "The wisdom is in the words of Imam Al-Shafi'i, where he used this verse as evidence for Consensus (Ijma'), meaning: whoever follows other than the path of the Companions who are the infallibility in our previous expression, and they are the Group to which the Messenger, peace be upon him, testified as being the Saved Sect, and whoever followed their path; these are the ones whose path it is not permissible to oppose for anyone who wants to be saved from the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. Therefore He said: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115]. Therefore: Muslims today at the end of time must know two things: First: Who are the Muslims mentioned in this verse? Then what is the wisdom that Allah, Mighty and Majestic, intended by them the Companions who are the Righteous Predecessors and whoever walked their path? The explanation and answer to this question or this wisdom has preceded. The summary of that is that the Companions were close in time to receiving the revelation fresh and tender from the mouth of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, first. Then they witnessed their Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, who lived among them applying the rulings stipulated in the Quran, and the mention of many of which came in his sayings, peace and blessings be upon him. While the Khalaf did not have this virtue, of hearing the Quran and the hadiths of the Messenger, peace be upon him, directly from him, nor did they have the virtue of witnessing the application of the Messenger, peace be upon him, of the texts of the Book and the Sunnah in practical application. And among the wisdom stated in the Sunnah is his saying, peace be upon him: \"News is not like witnessing,\" and from it the poet took his saying: And no seer is like one who heard. So: Those who did not witness the Messenger, peace be upon him, are not like his Companions who witnessed him",

    "text": "and heard speech from him directly and saw from him practical application. Today there is a modern phrase, which some Islamic callers have excelled in, and it is a very beautiful phrase, but more beautiful than it is that we make it a reality. They say in their lectures, sermons, and guidance: We must make Islam a reality walking on the earth. Beautiful speech, but if we do not understand Islam in the light of the understanding of the Righteous Predecessors - as we say - we cannot achieve this healing beautiful speech, to make Islam a realistic fact walking on the earth. Those who were able to do that were the Companions of the Messenger, peace be upon him, for the two reasons mentioned previously: They heard the speech from him directly, so they comprehended it with the best comprehension, then there are matters there that need clarification of action, so they saw the Messenger, peace be upon him, clarify that to them in action. And I give you a very clear example: There are verses in the Noble Quran that a Muslim cannot understand unless he knows the Sunnah that clarifies the Noble Quran, as He, Mighty and Majestic, said: {And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl: 44]. For example, His saying, Exalted is He: {[As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands} [Al-Ma'idah: 38]. Now bring the Sibawayh (master grammarian) of this time in the Arabic language to explain this noble verse to us: {The thief} who is he? Linguistically, he cannot define the thief. And the hand, what is it? The Sibawayh of the end of time cannot give the answer to these two questions: Who is the thief deserving of hand amputation, and what is the hand that should be amputated regarding this thief? In the language, a thief is one who steals an egg, he is a thief. And the hand is this; if cut here or here or in any place, it is a hand. But the answer is in... the previous verse: {And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl: 44]. The answer is in the clarification.

Perhaps I have given the answer to the question with this. Intervention: The second part: To what extent does opposition take a limit?

Righteous action means: what is known to everyone intuitively, so it does not need explanation except perhaps in some aspects and areas. As for beneficial knowledge, this is what is hidden from many people; because knowledge is what is derived from the Book of Allah and from the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, while relying on what our righteous Salaf were upon. Because they received the Sharia, Book and Sunnah, fresh and tender as the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, uttered it, without addition or subtraction in terms of narration, and without misunderstanding of the text from the Quran and Sunnah. That is why our call, which we harp on always and forever, is: that we call for acting upon the Book and the Sunnah, and upon the methodology of the righteous Salaf. Why do we say on the methodology of the righteous Salaf? To repel the deviation in understanding that may have afflicted the Book and the Sunnah.

They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: 'It is what I and my companions are upon.' Therefore, scholars agreed to term this sect, out of the seventy-three sects, the Saved Sect (Al-Firqah Al-Najiyah). So the Saved Sect, firstly: is one only, with no second. Then it is: out of seventy-three sects; seventy-two sects are in the Fire and one is in Paradise.\n\nToday, we live in the midst of ancient and modern sects and numerous parties. Some of the ancient sects, their names have vanished but their traces remain. For example, the Mu'tazili logic and the Mu'tazili school of thought, we hardly hear a mention of it these days, but it developed and sometimes appeared under the names of Islamic sects and Islamic schools of thought that are considered and recognized by the majority of Muslims, and sometimes as modern opinions but connected by a strong link to those ancient Mu'tazili opinions. As for the first instance I referred to just now, which exists under names recognized by Muslims, for example, the Ash'aris and the Maturidis. If we exclude from the Islamic world the sects known for deviating from the Sharia, such as the Shia, for example, the Zaydis, and the Khawarij, and limit our discussion to those who are named or call themselves Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (People of the Sunnah and the Community), then Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah today are three schools regarding beliefs (Aqeedah), and four schools regarding jurisprudence (Fiqh). As for the first three schools, they are: the Maturidis, the Ash'aris, and Ahlul-Hadith. These are three sects related to Creed only within Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah. As for the four schools, they are known to everyone in jurisprudential matters: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali. If we return to the first three schools, the Maturidis",

Nevertheless, they are present and spread within the Ash'ari school and the Maturidi school. The most important thing related to what I say exists of Mu'tazilism in the two mentioned schools: the Maturidi and the Ash'ari, the most important thing that can be mentioned now is a principle among principles and a rule among rules, which is: that an authentic Hadith (if it is Ahad/singular) does not establish creed. This is the opinion of the Mu'tazila, but the Ash'aris and Maturidis adopt this opinion as a rule and principle.\n\nThe second thing: The Mu'tazila were known among Ahlus-Sunnah truly for interpreting (Ta'wil) the verses of Attributes and the hadiths of Attributes. Interpretation (Ta'wil) is the brother of Negation/Suspension (Ta'til). What is meant by Ta'til is: denying the thing, denying the reality. So when there is a verse, or an authentic Prophetic hadith, and it has a clear, explicit indication, they suspend this indication and bring a meaning that does not immediately come to mind for that Quranic text or Prophetic hadith. This means: they did not follow the Book nor the Sunnah. However, we cannot say: they did not follow the Book and Sunnah by denying them [outright], but rather by circumventing them and exiting their explicit indication in the name of Interpretation (Ta'wil). That is why I said Ta'wil is the brother of Ta'til. We strike a common example: If an Arab man says: 'The King came,' what immediately comes to his mind and to the minds of those addressed by his speech is that the King's servant came? He said 'The King came,' so the listeners do not understand from his speech that he means: 'The King's servant came,' nor do they understand from it that 'The King's minister came.' So if an Arab man spoke this Arabic phrase, this Arabic sentence 'The King came,' and one of the listeners said: 'He means: The King's servant,' this person has suspended (negated) the speech of this speaker.",

So the Mu'tazila come, and the Maturidis and Ash'aris follow them in that, so they interpret some Quranic verses and Prophetic hadiths with such an interpretation about which we rightly said: It is the brother of Ta'til (Negation). In the noble verse: {And your Lord comes, and the angels, rank upon rank} [Al-Fajr: 22]. 'Your Lord comes,' and there is no resemblance [to creation], just as we said previously 'The King came.' No, 'The King did not come, who came is the King's servant, the King's minister.' There is a difference between the King's servant and his minister, of course. Even so, if it is interpreted as the King's minister, it is invalid (Batil) and idle (Atil), and if it is interpreted as the King's servant, it is even more idle. Yes. So their saying in interpreting the saying of our Lord, Mighty and Majestic: {And your Lord comes, and the angels, rank upon rank} [Al-Fajr: 22]. 'Your Lord comes' means: 'Your Lord's command,' or 'A creation from your Lord's creation,' or something like that is possible, but not Him, nor His Self. Where did this problem come to them from? Or where did this Ta'til come from?! From drawing an analogy between the Creator and the created, from drawing an analogy between the Absent (Unseen) and the Present (Witnessed). They say: It is not permissible to describe Allah with movement. We do not describe Allah with movement; because He was not described with that. Neither He described Himself with that, nor did His Prophet describe Him with that; but He described Himself that He came, meaning: on the Day of Resurrection. So we say He came, and we do not say that He came means: He moved. They refuse to believe in the explicit Quran. Similarly, for example, regarding this meaning: The known and famous Hadith, rather it is a Mutawatir Hadith to us due to its many authentic paths: 'Our Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven.' The true Ahlus-Sunnah, who are Ahlul-Hadith: believe in the previously mentioned verse on its apparent meaning. 'Your Lord comes': Your Lord came. 'Our Lord descends': Our Lord descends. As for",

"text": "the Mu'tazila, and the Ash'aris followed them in much of what they followed them in: No, our Lord does not descend. Just as they said: He does not come, they also said He does not descend. Then: What is the meaning of 'Our Lord descends'? Meaning: His mercy. This is interpretation (Ta'wil). This Ta'wil is Ta'til (Negation). This Ta'til necessitates denying legal realities related to the Divine Attributes. Our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, when He describes Himself in His Book, or on the tongue of His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, it is only to make His servants know Him, Blessed and Exalted; because He is absent from us [Unseen], and we cannot see Him except on the Day of Resurrection, God willing. So when we come to the verses of Attributes and hadiths of Attributes, and bring for them meanings other than the apparent, clear meanings from the Quranic or Hadith texts, this means: that we have denied these Divine Attributes. 'Your Lord comes' - Your Lord did not come. 'Our Lord descends' - Our Lord does not descend. Glory be to Allah! If there was a text that He does not come and does not descend, we would believe. But the texts are to the contrary. So how do we describe our Lord with what He did not describe Himself with, and declare Him far above what He described Himself with? This is Ta'til. And this is what some of the Sunni Islamic schools fell into, as we said, such as the Maturidis and Ash'aris.\nThat is why we said: We call to following the Book and the Sunnah, and upon the methodology of the righteous Salaf, so that we do not fall into such deviations which the Mu'tazila started, then many of those who belong to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah followed them in it. Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah today, in the convention of the present age, and in Al-Azhar Al-Sharif, and Islamic universities, etc., are Ahlul-Hadith, the Maturidis, and the Ash'aris. Okay, these are three schools in Creed. How can there be three schools in Creed? In matters of the Unseen? They say: Their difference is a mercy. This could have been possible, and this has been said regarding Rulings (Ahkam). Their difference is mercy in rulings, meaning: there is ease. As some ignorant people say: That on the Day of Resurrection, he stands at the beginning of the Sirat (Bridge)... terrors, as if they are the ones holding people to account. The man comes",

"text": "for example, a Hanafi in school, prayed in a certain way [that might be invalid in his school], but it is valid in another school. The second Imam tells him: Come, easy, your prayer is valid according to my school. And so on. This is manifest error.\nSo I said: It can be said: That difference in branches (Furu') contains ease. And they built upon that this superstition we mentioned related to the Sirat. Even so, difference is not a mercy even in branches. So how can we say: Three schools in Creed where it is impossible to imagine two forms in Creed? In some legal rulings, it is possible there are two faces. Meaning: As Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, expresses, he says: Difference is of two types: Difference of Contradiction, and Difference of Variety.\nDifference of Contradiction: So-and-so performed ablution and touched a woman. What is the ruling on his ablution? An opinion: His ablution is broken. And an opinion: His ablution is not broken. This is a difference of contradiction. Both opinions cannot be correct in the reality of the Sharia. Rather, one of them is correct. What is correct? The people of knowledge know it, and the people of knowledge are those who derive knowledge from the Book and the Sunnah. This is difference of contradiction; both opinions cannot be correct.\nDifference of Variety: Imam Al-Shafi'i says: The opening supplication [of prayer]: 'I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth...' to the end. Imam Abu Hanifa says: 'Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.' The Muhaddithun: 'O Allah, distance me from my sins...' to the end. Is there conflict or collision? There is no conflict or collision. If you open with 'I turned,' it is permissible. 'Glory be to You,' permissible. 'O Allah distance,' permissible. And there are many other supplications I mentioned in 'The Description of Prayer.' This is difference of variety.",

Meaning: Our Lord either descends or does not descend, comes or does not come, rose over the Throne or did not rise over the Throne, and the like. Despite this, three schools were found in Creed. How can these three schools in Creed be conceived as truth? And our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, says: {So what is there after the truth except error?} [Yunus: 32].\nTherefore; in order to be safe from falling into such difference, and safe from falling into such deviation from the Book and Sunnah in understanding: It is not [just] belief in the Book and Sunnah. All Islamic sects believe in the Book and Sunnah, but many of them do not believe in the Book and Sunnah [truly]. They believe in it in wording, but do not believe in it in meaning. So what is the benefit of believing in the wording without believing in the meaning? So you realized how they believe in the wording? But they do not believe in the meaning.\nTherefore, to avoid falling into such deviation, we call to following the Book and the Sunnah, and upon the methodology of the righteous Salaf. How can we know what our righteous Salaf were upon, whether related to Creed, or related to Fiqh, or related to behavior?\nThe way by which we know what the Messenger, peace be upon him, was upon: is the same way by which we know what the righteous Salaf were upon. Meaning: briefly, the way of Narration (Riwayah), the way of Hadith, and receiving narrations related whether to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, or to the righteous Salaf, or by way of narrations and Hadith.\nThis path, the masses of Muslims have deviated from today, and centuries before today.

"text": "the righteous Salaf. They did not feel this. But we, by the grace of those people of knowledge who preceded us, became aware of this important point, which is: the necessity of understanding the Book and Sunnah according to the methodology of the righteous Salaf. Among the evidence for that is His saying, Blessed and Exalted: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115].\nHere is a very precise and subtle point in the noble verse: Our Lord mentioned 'the way of the believers' as a conjunction to opposing Allah and the Messenger. He said: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him} [An-Nisa: 115]. He did not suffice with this opposition, but conjoined to it His saying: {and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115].\nI wonder, what is the point of mentioning 'the way of the believers'? If the verse were hypothetically: 'And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination,' would it fulfill the purpose that the verse fulfilled with the completion: {and follows other than the way of the believers}? We say: No. Therefore: Here is a profound point in Allah, Mighty and Majestic, mentioning the sentence 'and follows other than the way of the believers' as a conjunction to the saying of the Lord of the Worlds: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115]. Why did He mention this sentence? It becomes clear to you now why? Meaning: [Connection] is by following the way of the believers who followed him with excellence, peace and blessings be upon him. Otherwise, if we did as the Mu'tazila and Khawarij did, insisted on our own views and imposed our understandings, rather our desires, on the texts of the Book and Sunnah, we would have gone far astray, and we would have been among those who opposed Allah and the Messenger. In the name of what? 'This is how we understand.' This is the reason for the deviant sects falling into opposition to the Sharia in many Creeds, let alone",

"text": "jurisprudential rulings. I usually give a simple example; to clarify the importance of this restriction we benefited from the previous verse, and from the first Hadith: 'What I and my companions are upon.' I give a simple example: A verse in the Holy Quran, one of the clearest verses in explaining the Divine intent, which is His saying, Blessed and Exalted, describing the people of Paradise in Paradise: {Faces, that Day, will be radiant * Looking at their Lord} [Al-Qiyamah: 22-23].\nWhat was the stance of the Mu'tazila and Khawarij regarding this verse, while it is explicit that among the blessings of Allah, Blessed and Exalted, upon the believers in Paradise, indeed it is the greatest blessing Allah bestows upon the people of Paradise: that they see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection. So when they see Him, Blessed and Exalted, they forget all the bliss of Paradise. Yes.\nWhat did the Mu'tazila and Khawarij do regarding this verse? Did they deny it? No, they did not deny it; because if they denied it, they would have exited the religion as a hair is pulled from dough. But they suspended (negated) it, distorted its explicit indication. {Looking at their Lord} [Al-Qiyamah: 23], they said: 'Looking at the *bounty* of their Lord.' Nothing wrong with it, 'looking at the bounty of their Lord.' They estimated a deleted possessive noun (Mudaf Mahdhuf). As we said just now: To clarify how the Arabic language should be understood, let alone the Divine Speech based on the Arabic language? 'The Prince came,' 'The King came.' Is it permissible for us to understand 'The Prince's or King's servant came'? No. My brother, he tells you: 'This is a known matter in Arabic language, estimating a deleted possessive noun.' Here is a research among the people of knowledge, they say: Estimating a deleted possessive noun is permissible when there is evidence necessitating that, otherwise the Arabic language would be disabled. I say: 'Ahmed came.' Yes. Is it understood 'His son came'? 'Ahmed came' - 'His son came'? My brother, where did you get this interpretation (Ta'wil) from? There is no answer",

Yes.\n\nIntervention: And they understand the truth.\n\nThe Sheikh: They understand the truth, but the truth did not agree with their desires. Therefore, they tell you there is a necessity for interpretation. What is its proof? It did not enter his mind. The meaning of this: We do not say they are not believers absolutely, but we say: with all boldness that their faith is deficient and weak; because Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says in the beginning of Surah Al-Baqarah: {Alif, Lam, Mim * This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah} [Al-Baqarah: 1-2]. Who are they? {Who believe in the unseen} [Al-Baqarah: 3]. The first attribute of the pious: those who believe in the unseen. Okay. Among the unseen: {Looking at their Lord} [Al-Qiyamah: 23]. It does not need philosophy. They persisted in using human reason, like: human powers, can you remove the mountain from its place? No. Human power is limited. Likewise sight is limited, hearing is limited. Likewise what? The mind is completely limited. Everything, meaning: Man was created weak. So when they hear the verse: {Looking at their Lord} [Al-Qiyamah: 23], surely if we said: {Looking at their Lord} [Al-Qiyamah: 23] it means: We confined Him in a direction, we put Him above, we put Him in front, etc., from these doubts they derived from what they witness around them as created beings. But the Creator, they forgot that He described Himself with two attributes: one positive, and the other negative.\nPositive: An attribute existing in Him. Negative: Exaltation of Him, Blessed and Exalted. So He said: And He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\n\nIntervention: {There is nothing like unto Him} [Ash-Shura: 11].\n\nThe Sheikh: {There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing} [Ash-Shura: 11].",

Exaltation; that anything that crosses your mind regarding the attributes of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, where the matter confuses you if it were like our attributes, you immediately say 'There is nothing like unto Him.' But is He merely a meaning existing in the mind with no reality and no existence?! Far be it from Him. Meaning: We can now imagine the Anqa (Phoenix). The Anqa is an ancient imaginary Arabic name, a large bird Sinbad the Sailor talks about, in the story of One Thousand and One Nights and the like. That it is a large bird, meaning: the eggs that come out are like a dome. And he tells the story, in it is amusement and it is all imagination upon imagination. The Anqa: A name without a body, a name in the mind, a meaning existing in the mind. But outside the mind, meaning: in reality, it has no truth.\nSo our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, who has all attributes of perfection, and is free from all attributes of deficiency, is He like this, a meaning existing in our souls and has no reality existing outside this universe, outside this mind?! Allah is greater than that. Rather He created the heavens and the earth. So He has all attributes of perfection. He is an Essence existing in reality, and having all attributes of perfection. Since the matter is so, what are His attributes, Mighty and Majestic? There is no room for us in the mind to describe Him from ourselves. Rather, He has spared us the burden of stripping our minds by describing Himself to us in the Book and in the Sunnah.\nAmong these attributes: {Looking at their Lord} [Al-Qiyamah: 23]. That the believers, as one of the jurist poets said, we can say:\nThe believers see Him without how... and without likeness or striking of an example.\nYes. So seeing Allah is established in the Hereafter. The Mu'tazila denied it, the Khawarij denied it due to the lack [in their view] of texts from the Book and Sunnah. No, the texts exist, but they distorted them and negated their meanings. So then: They did not benefit anything from their belief in these texts while denying the realities of",

Here is the heart of the matter as it is said: By returning to what the righteous Salaf were upon. The Quran is interpreted first by the Quran, then by the authentic Sunnah, then by the Salafi traditions. So do we find among the righteous Salaf an interpretation of this verse: {Faces, that Day, will be radiant * Looking at their Lord} [Al-Qiyamah: 22-23] meaning: 'at the bounty of their Lord'?! Never. Every tradition coming from the Salaf agrees with the apparent meaning of the verse first, then with the authentic, explicit Hadiths indicating that the verse is on its apparent meaning which every Arab understands if he is not afflicted by whim, not afflicted by partisanship or detestable factionalism.\nThere is another verse; He said: {For those who have done good is the Best (Reward) and Extra} [Yunus: 26]. The interpretation of this verse came in the authentic Hadith in Muslim: {For those who have done good is the Best} [Yunus: 26] meaning: Paradise. {And Extra} [Yunus: 26] meaning: Seeing Allah in the Hereafter.\n\nIntervention: Did they interpret it?\n\nThe Sheikh: They interpreted it as something else, seeing blessings and the like of what was mentioned previously. This is called Ta'til (Negation).\nIn short, and perhaps I took longer than the questioner wanted with the question, in short I say: May Allah have mercy on Ibn al-Qayyim who said:\nKnowledge is: Allah said, His Messenger said... The Companions said; it is not by deception.\nKnowledge is not your setting up disagreement foolishly... Between the Messenger and the opinion of a jurist.\nNor is it the denial of Attributes and negating them...

Sufficient for you as an example of that: The new sect, which is the Qadiani sect who are called Ahmadis. These are the latest Islamic sects that have an entity, figures, prominence, and a widespread call in Europe and America in the name of Islam. These are Muslims who pray the five prayers, and make pilgrimage to the Sacred House of Allah, but they deny legal realities stated in the Book and Sunnah, which no one preceded them in saying. Not like the Mu'tazila and the Maturidi Ash'aris. For example: They deny that there is a creation called the Jinn, even though there is a surah in the Quran named Surah Al-Jinn. Okay. Do they deny the Quran? Do they deny the Surah? No. But they say to us: You did not understand the meaning of Jinn. Like 'Ins' (Humans) and 'Bashar' (Humans), do these two words indicate one named entity or two? No, one named entity. They then brought a third name. 'Ins,' 'Bashar,' and 'Jinn' are three names applied to one named entity, which is: Humans.\nWhen you bring them a verse in the Quran: {You created me from fire and created him from clay} [Al-A'raf: 12], he says to you: This is not real fire, nor real clay, rather this is a metaphor, a metaphor. And when you bring him the authentic Hadith in Muslim: 'Allah created the Angels from light, and created the Jinn from fire, and created Adam from what has been described to you,' he says to you: This is an Ahad Hadith (singular narration), Ahad Hadith Ahad, a Hadith that is not Mutawatir (consecutive) meaning. An Ahad Hadith does not establish creed. And this deviation, which is: that an Ahad Hadith does not establish creed, unfortunately is not a Qadiani doctrine.

Then I said to him: Suppose there are Cherubim Angels, so what is after that? Is there anything there? Did the universe end? He said: The universe ended. So: There is no place left? There is no place left. So: When we say: The Most Merciful rose above the Throne, why do you accuse us that we put Him in a place? There is no place here, O people, by our admission, by everyone's agreement that the universe is limited and the end of the universe after which nothing exists is the Throne. And our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, is above the Throne, above all creations. As the jurist poet also said:\nAnd the Lord of the Throne is above the Throne but... without description of settlement and contact.\nFor He is Rich (Free of need) of the worlds. But there is no escape rationally and legally from saying: That Allah, Mighty",

"text": "Therefore, I was very impressed by a word from one of the intelligent princes. Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him and reward him with good on behalf of Islam, struggled in the way of defending the doctrine of the Salaf a great struggle. And as you know, the people of innovation always rise against the people of Sunnah, and especially in old times and in the time of Ibn Taymiyyah, all the Sheikhs were against him. So they complained to the Prince in Damascus and asked him to gather us with him in order to establish the proof against him before you. So the Prince invited them. The discussion began on some points of Creed, among them: That Ibn Taymiyyah says: Allah, Mighty and Majestic, has the attribute of Highness (Uluw) above all creations. And they say: No, Allah is in every place, like you hear in this time on the slightest occasion, he tells you: Allah exists in all existence! What is the meaning of Allah exists in all existence? Among existence are sewers, toilets, bars, inns, and taverns, etc. Allah exists in all existence.\nThe summary: The discussion took place between Ibn Taymiyyah and the Sheikhs. Ibn Taymiyyah established the proof against them with speech like this which you heard and more. What did this intelligent, wise Prince say? He is not a scholar, but he heard the debate between Ibn Taymiyyah and the majority of the Sheikhs. So he said about the Sheikhs: 'These people have lost their Lord.' This is correct speech; because it means: neither above nor below, neither right nor left, etc. These are people who lost their Lord, they do not know their Lord whom they worship. But when you prostrate you say: Glory to my Lord the Most High. You do not know this 'my Lord the Most High' is in every place. What is the meaning of Glory to my Lord the Most High? {The Most Merciful rose over the Throne} [Taha: 5] meaning: Rose above/Exalted. Therefore, it is very, very necessary that we stick to this methodology which is acting upon the Book and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of the righteous Salaf. That is why the people of knowledge said:\nAnd all good is in following who preceded ... And all evil is in the innovation of who came later.\n(Al-Huda wan-Nur / 161/ 35: 49: 00)",

What is the reality of this statement in front of the practical reality, and the hoped-for aspirations?\n\nThe Answer: The truth is as stated in the question. However, I said just now, commenting on the hadith of that Bedouin who said: By Allah, I will not add to them nor subtract, and I continued my speech and said that among the obligations is avoiding prohibitions, and that a person must combine performing obligations and avoiding prohibitions. I said during this speech: And to do of that what he can. And if he can add to that some other acts of obedience and worship which are not obligatory, then that is better and more lasting.\nThe point: {Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity} [Al-Baqarah: 286].\nAnd people today, in reality: And I mean by people those who care about their religion, and adhere to the rulings of their Sharia, and farewell to those others who are not in the first category of people adhering to the Sharia rulings. They are confused about what or how to proceed, and how to work for Islam while Islam today is ruled by non-Islamic laws, and by states that do not rule by what Allah revealed. So what is the work?\nWe say: We have a brief word, and this research is long-tailed. We say a very brief word: We read it from one of the Islamic preachers, may Allah have mercy on him: And it is to me as if it were from the revelation of Heaven, and there is no revelation after the Messenger of Allah, but there is inspiration.

And some of them, nearly a century has passed for them, then nothing but cheers and shouts. What is the reason, I wonder? The reason is that we do not start from where the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, started. And some of these groups do not think at all about refining the soul and reforming individuals and laying the foundation upon which the state is built, or by which the Islamic society is realized.\nWe all know that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, was sent among a deeply ignorant Jahiliyyah nation, committing various sins and transgressions. Yet he remained for about more than ten years, rather exactly thirteen years, calling to Monotheism (Tawhid), to the worship of Allah alone having no partner. And he was not struggling (Jihad), nor fighting, nor prohibiting wine, and gambling, and killing the innocent soul without right, etc. Rather, that they worship Allah and avoid Taghut (false deities) for thirteen years like this.\nThen the Messenger, peace be upon him, migrated from Mecca to Medina, and there the rulings began to descend in some detail. And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, began founding the Muslim state after he had found the individuals and raised them, peace and blessings be upon him, under his eye, and perfected their discipline and was confident of his raising of them. So he became certain, feeling that they would ransom him with everything, with themselves and their wealth, and with every dear thing to them. After that, the battle began between him and the Arabs, and between the Jews, and this biography is long, you know it. The point: That the Messenger, peace be upon him, the first thing he started with was establishing the base of Islam which is: The testimony that there is no deity but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\nMany Islamic groups today are keen on establishing Islamic rule, but the saying of that Arab poet applies to them:",

This is not how camels are watered, O Sa'd.\nEveryone who opposes the methodology of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family - and now I say: after I clarified to you the meaning of Sunnah: everyone who opposes the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and you have known the meaning of Sunnah: the methodology which the Messenger, peace be upon him, walked upon - will never succeed as long as life lasts. Will never succeed; because he did not walk the path which the Messenger, peace be upon him, enacted for us. He said in the first Hadith: 'I left among you two matters, you will never go astray as long as you hold fast to them: The Book of Allah and my Sunnah.'\nSo those who want to establish the rule of Allah on earth, if they do not walk the path which the Messenger, peace be upon him, walked, they will never reach their goal at all. Rather, the more time passes for them, the further they get from the goal they set before their eyes. How not, when the general Islamic world today, and among them individuals who belong to many of those groups, do not yet know the meaning of La ilaha illa Allah. They do not know this testimony, this good word. And Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says in the Noble Quran: {So know that there is no deity except Allah} [Muhammad: 19].\nSo if this Divine Command: is to be directed to the Ummah of the Messenger, peace be upon him, in the person of the Messenger. Who is the address to? 'So know' is an address to an individual, but in reality, it is an address to the Ummah of the Messenger, peace be upon him; because Allah, Blessed and Exalted, when He chose His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, as a Messenger to the worlds, a mercy to all of them, undoubtedly he [the Prophet] knows the meaning of Tawhid, the meaning of La ilaha illa Allah. So when He says: 'So know that there is no deity except Allah,' it is from the chapter of, although this might not be fitting, but it's okay, it's from the chapter of speech 'To you [I speak] O neighbor [daughter-in-law], but listen O neighbor.' So this address is not for the Messenger in intent and aim. In wording it is for him, but in intent and aim for whom? For the Ummah of peace and blessings be upon him and his family.\nThe Ummah of the Messenger now reaches millions upon millions. I do not mean them by this speech of mine, but rather I mean",

Has this Ummah known, has it complied with this Divine Command which was directed to the Ummah entirely in the person of their Prophet, peace be upon him? I say with regret: No. Most of them do not know the meaning of this good word. They say it without doubt, and he who came under the strike of the sword said it, but does he know? Allah knows best. Even so, when this man said it, and the Muslim did not trust when he saw him say it out of fear (Taqiyyah), did not trust this word so he struck him and killed him. But the Messenger, peace be upon him, who came with a Sharia that proceeds on the apparent aspects of matters said to him: 'Did you tear open his heart?' So it is not permissible to apply rulings like this on the hidden aspects of matters; because no one knows them except Allah, Mighty and Majestic. But the Muslim who hopes first for salvation from eternity in the Fire due to associating partners with Allah, Mighty and Majestic - and this is not only what these people hope for, but they hope to establish the rule of Allah on earth. These people should truly be: the elite of Muslims, the elite of the Islamic Ummah which was addressed by His saying: {So know that there is no deity except Allah} [Muhammad: 19] in understanding, action, and character. So where are these people while they are far, very far from understanding the word of Tawhid, let alone the details of this Sunnah regarding which we mentioned two Hadiths: 'Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me.' 'I left among you two matters, you will never go astray as long as you hold fast to them: The Book of Allah and my Sunnah, and they will not separate until they return to me at the Basin.'\nTherefore: We who belong to numerous groups, all covered by the circle of Islam, must agree on a common word.

Is there in much of the Muslim Ummah which was addressed by that noble verse anyone who worships other than Allah? Islamic lands are filled with Muslims worshiping other than Allah. But most people do not know. But most people do not know and do not thank the Lord of the Worlds who sent to them this Noble Prophet and left them on the White Path from which no one deviates except he who is destroyed. So a common word: Returning to the Book and the Sunnah in understanding and action. Without that, there is absolutely no life for Muslims. This is what we must work on. We must not rush things, and do, or have applied to us that joke which is narrated about that shepherd who was herding the sheep of the village people. He sat one day in his humble tent, and had hung beneath it the pot filled with a little ghee which he collected from the sheep. So he sat one day at noon resting and began thinking that tomorrow my wealth will increase, and I will marry and our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, will grant us children and they will become my helpers. And if one of them does not listen to my words, by Allah I will do and do and raise this stick and hit him. And nothing went but the stick hitting the jar above his head and the ghee spilled all over the ground. So this one is thinking in fantasy, and he has to do what Allah obligated upon him of His obedience and within the limits of what he can.\nWe are now rushing things, thinking how to establish the Muslim State? How to get rid of this injustice and this humiliation surrounding us from every side, while the small state which that wise man ordered us saying: Establish the state of Islam in your hearts, it will be established for you on your land. This small state, after we establish it in our hearts, then how do we establish this lofty edifice, this great state which needs millions of Muslims with general Islamic culture in Islam as we said just now: in understanding and application.

We want an explanation for this Hadith, and especially this phrase: (Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs). What is intended by it? Of course in many cases: in the case where it agrees with the texts, and in the case where it contradicts the texts, and in the case if disagreement occurs between them, and so on?\n\nThe Answer: There is no doubt that the command in the first Hadith: 'Follow those after me: Abu Bakr and Umar,' there is no doubt that they are the people whose companion is not miserable, and that they are the second role model after our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. The reason for that is very clear to anyone who knows the history of these two great men; as they were the closest people to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, in following, connection to him, and learning from him. So if a person wants to give a fatwa on an issue... by an opinion, whether this opinion stems from himself, or from others among the people of knowledge, and it was contrary to what is established from the two Caliphs mentioned in the Hadith, Abu Bakr and Umar, there is no doubt that their opinion takes precedence over the opinion of others; due to that special status they have with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family.\nAs for his saying, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, in the Hadith of Al-Irbad bin Sariyah: 'So stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Mahdi Caliphs after me, bite onto it with molars' ... to the end of the Hadith, indeed",

"text": "many people misunderstand this Hadith. They think that the meaning of the Hadith: (So stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Caliphs) means: the Sunnah of one of the Caliphs. Here, without doubt, is a deleted possessive noun (Mudaf Mahdhuf). I wonder, is the estimation of this deleted noun 'one of the Caliphs,' or is its estimation 'all of the Caliphs'? There is a very big difference between these two estimations. Because the first estimation: 'and the Sunnah of one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs,' means: that it is sufficient that one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs stated an opinion or exercised Ijtihad, and the Messenger, peace be upon him, orders Muslims to take it, and considers exiting from it misguidance and innovation in religion. Whereas the other opinion or estimation, which is the Sunnah of the collective Rightly Guided Caliphs, the matter is completely different.\nThere is no doubt that the agreement of the Rightly Guided Caliphs on something is almost impossible to be an error in itself, contrary to if one of them was unique in an opinion without the others. Then the big difference appears between the meaning of each of the two estimations. There is no doubt nor suspicion in my mind that the second estimation is the one that agrees with some other legal texts, among them His saying, Exalted is He: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115]. Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says: {and follows other than the way of the believers}. Is it the way of one of the believers? Likewise: 'The Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs,' all four of them and not one of them. Then factual history indicates that it is very far-fetched that the Prophet, peace be upon him and his family, would order Muslims to follow one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, especially if it became clear later that it was an Ijtihad from him, and the evidence or reality indicated that success did not accompany it.\nWe said just now regarding the Hadith: 'Follow those after me,' we said there is no doubt that a Muslim must emulate these two noble Companions and prioritize their opinion over his own. But does he prioritize the opinion of one of them over his own? This is a point of discussion; because opinion may be correct from the predecessor or correct from the successor. So if",

"text": "the correctness is from the predecessor, then the error is from the successor, and vice versa exactly.\nHere, for example: Some examples: It has been established with certainty that Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, used to forbid Mut'ah of Hajj (Tamattu'), bearing in mind that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, performed Tamattu' and ordered Tamattu', and became angry at those who did not respond to his command.\nI say: He did and ordered, looking in this expression at the fact that Tamattu' is of two types: Tamattu' known in Fiqh books as: Qiran, and Tamattu' known in them as Tamattu', but Qiran itself contains Tamattu' (enjoyment) as well. Therefore, it was a way to reconcile some Hadiths, some of which say the Messenger performed Qiran and some say: performed Tamattu'. Since Tamattu' existing in the minds of many people, ancient and modern, is that which occurs between Hajj and Umrah, separating by decomposition (Tahallul) - so he performs Umrah and decomposes, then performs Hajj. This is the Tamattu' known in Fiqh books. So when they hear from the Hadith of Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, in the Two Sahihs: That the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, performed Tamattu', and likewise Imran bin Husain says: 'The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, performed Tamattu' and we performed Tamattu', then a man said with his opinion what he wished.' Let this matter not be confusing, nor let the Hadith of the Messenger's Qiran conflict with the Hadith of his Tamattu', peace be upon him; because every Qiran is Tamattu', and not every Tamattu' is Qiran. What is the aspect of enjoyment (Tamattu') for the Qarin? That is that he enjoys the virtue of Umrah without tightening a saddle for it... a journey. So this is enjoyment. But the complete enjoyment is to separate between Umrah and Hajj.\nThe point: That Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, forbade people from performing Tamattu' after the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, even though the Messenger, peace be upon him, actually performed Tamattu' - and you knew that I mean by Tamattu' the Qiran - and ordered Tamattu' when he ordered his companions after they performed Tawaf of Arrival, and stood on Marwa",

The important thing is one of the Companions said: O Messenger of Allah! Is this Umrah of ours for this year of ours or for eternity? He said: 'Rather for eternity of eternity, Umrah has entered into Hajj until the Day of Resurrection,' and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, interlaced his fingers.

So when he said to them, peace be upon him: 'Decompose, O people, for were it not that I drove the sacrificial animal, I would have decomposed with you,' Jabir said - and he is the narrator of the story of the Prophet's Hajj, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, may Allah be pleased with him and his father - he said: So the people decomposed, and the incense burners smoked, and they approached women.",

"text": "Despite all these things, Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, used to forbid people from performing Tamattu'. Among the wonders that make a Muslim keen on adhering to the Sunnah, and not adhering to the opinions of men; because which man is more knowledgeable (Faqih) than Umar bin Al-Khattab? Despite that, he fell into such opposition, where he said justifying the prohibition of enjoying Umrah until Hajj (Tamattu'), he said: One of them decomposes and goes to Mina while his organ is dripping [seminal] fluid. The exact same thing which some of those who held back from rushing to respond to the Prophet's saying denied when he said to them what he said; Umar returned to that. So glory be to my Lord, He did not make anyone infallible in legislation except the Prophets and Messengers. Therefore, infallibility, as he said peace be upon him, is holding fast to the Sunnah. This is one known about Umar bin Al-Khattab. The reality is that he finds supporters even to this time. Despite contradicting very, very many Hadiths, you find some people saying: Ifrad (Singular Hajj) is better. With the Prophet's command to decompose and his anger at those who refrained from decomposing and similar emphasized sayings. And we mentioned just now his saying: 'Umrah has entered into Hajj until the Day of Resurrection.' Many people still hold onto the saying of the permissibility of Singular Hajj (Hajj Mufrad), and find a basis for themselves. But this basis is flimsy when we return to the likes of his saying, peace be upon him: 'I left among you two matters, you will never go astray as long as you hold fast to them: The Book of Allah and my Sunnah...' to the end of the Hadith.\nAnd another thing whose bitterness Muslims tasted in this time, while before that all Muslims were upon it, which is that Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, made divorce by the word 'three' count as three. If a man said to his wife: 'You are divorced thrice,' she became irrevocably separated from him (Baynuna Kubra) according to what Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, enacted in his time. So she is not lawful for him afterwards until she marries a husband other than him. This ruling proceeded in the four schools of thought until less than half a century of...",

"text": "time ago. When complaints began to multiply before Islamic judges regarding the frequent occurrence of separation which has no solution except after she marries another husband, they looked and found this problem existing. So they found no solution for it except by returning, I do not say to the Sunnah, but rather by returning to the one who was holding fast to the Sunnah. And the difference for us is very substantial, because those who solved the problem of the frequency of divorce among Muslims in this era resorted to opinions, some valid and some not, not on the claim of following the most correct, but following what suits the time. What suits the time today, that divorce by the utterance of three is one, is more correct than saying as they used to say before that it is three. Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, exercised Ijtihad in this issue as he did in the first issue. But I differentiate between his Ijtihad here and his Ijtihad in the first issue. The first issue I find no face (justification) for it. The other issue I find a face for it from the perspective of observing the change of rulings with the change of time. That is among what is clear in the Hadith that says that Umar made divorce by the utterance of three count as three, that he drew attention to why he did that? The answer: To discipline those who overuse divorce and multiply it, and oppose the Sharia in the manner of pronouncing it. The Sharia says in the Noble Quran: {Divorce is twice. Then, either keep [her] in an acceptable manner or release [her] with good treatment.} [Al-Baqarah: 229], {And if he has divorced her [for the third time], then she is not lawful to him afterward until [after] she marries a husband other than him.} [Al-Baqarah: 230]. The meaning of the noble verse: Legal divorce is two times. Each time holding in kindness or releasing with goodness. Divorce is two times means: once, once. Not 'two times' [at once]. No. Divorce is two times, time after time. In each time either holding and taking back, or releasing with goodness. So he who says to his wife: 'You are divorced thrice,' has combined what Allah separated, and tightened what Allah made easy. Our Lord said each time holding in kindness or releasing with goodness.

"text": "did not give himself latitude. He said to her: Go, you are divorced thrice. And some fools say: Whenever a Sheikh returns you, you are forbidden to me. From these exaggerations and nonsense. The Wise Lawgiver is of utmost wisdom. Divorce is two times, in each time holding in kindness or releasing with goodness. So if he divorces her once then reconsiders and takes her back, this is one divorce. If he divorces her a second time and reconsiders also and takes her back and holds her, this is the second. But if the third occurs, she slips from his hand, and might be the share of another. So she is not lawful to him afterwards until she marries a husband other than him. When people opposed the Law of Allah, or began opposing the Law of Allah in the time of Umar, he said: I see people have hastened a matter in which they had respite/patience (Anah), so I see that I should make it three against them. Then it appeared to him [good] so he enforced it as three. This is clear evidence that he did that as Ijtihad. And this Ijtihad is a temporal ruling suitable for the situation wherein those people were hastening the execution of divorce at once, while our Lord made it three. But with great regret, this Umari Sunnah, which observed a temporal interest, became a continuous Sunnah until a near time. While the Hadith of Ibn Abbas in Sahih Muslim is explicit to the contrary: Divorce in the time of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and in the time of Abu Bakr and the caliphate of Umar in the beginning, and a part of the beginning of Umar's caliphate, was considered one divorce. Then it appeared to Umar [to change it] as we mentioned just now. So: We can say: The Sunnah of the Messenger, the Sunnah of Abu Bakr, and the Sunnah of Umar in the beginning of his caliphate are all agreed that the triple divorce in one utterance is one divorce. But Umar exercised Ijtihad and saw fit to invalidate that habit by making it three against them as a punishment for them. It was incumbent upon the scholars who came after him to return to the Sunnah, the Sunnah of the Messenger and Abu Bakr and Umar in the beginning of his caliphate. But for a wisdom Allah wants, this ruling continued until about a quarter of a century ago roughly. So some Islamic judges who did not have the idea of acting upon the Book and Sunnah, but rather wanted to address people's issues and problems, began... They found that Ibn",

They said: We solve the problem by relying on Ibn Taymiyyah's fatwa. While the duty upon them was to return to the Sunnah. So then: Umar bin Al-Khattab, who is one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, held this opinion. So the Messenger does not mean: 'So stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs' meaning: one of them. But rather the collective of them, similar to what we mentioned regarding His saying, Exalted is He: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115], meaning: follows the way of other than all believers. Otherwise the matter would be a problem; if someone opposed a Muslim, it would mean he opposed Allah and His Messenger. Likewise the Hadith: 'Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs - all of them, collectively - bite onto it with molars, and beware of newly invented matters...' to the end of the Hadith. This is my answer regarding these two Hadiths. (Al-Huda wan-Nur / 288/ 32: 00: 00)",

Out of Abdullah's eagerness - may Allah be pleased with him and his father - to preserve the Sunnah, he used to write, unlike the masses of Companions who were illiterate and did not write. So out of his eagerness to preserve the Sunnah, he used to write. So the polytheists blamed him, and no wonder, for they are misguided. They said: You write from Muhammad what he says in the hour of contentment and anger?! As if a doubt occurred to him. So he came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and told him what the polytheists said.

So: If the matter is so, we imagine that this sect either notices its shortcoming from this aspect, or acknowledges that it is not falling short; because it is taking the means that can lead it to realizing this description in it.

Either we say it can, yet we do not do it, so we are not the Victorious Sect. Or we say: It is not possible except to start from here.

The other narration raised to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, which is weak, is that they are in the environs of Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). This is raised but its chain is weak. This and that, meaning: this weak narration and that authentic stopped narration, do not negate that the Victorious Sect could be in some Islamic lands, and not confined to Al-Sham. For example, if we assume that this stopped Hadith has the ruling of being raised, and if we concede that this stopped Hadith is in the ruling of being raised, there is no doubt that the matter will be so. And we indicated just now that the believers exist in all lands of Islam, even if they are few, weak, scattered and dispersed.

Based on that, it is not unlikely that this place is Al-Sham as Mu'adh bin Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, said as in Sahih Al-Bukhari. Then we do not exclude that the most specific part of Al-Sham is Damascus of Al-Sham, where he, peace and blessings be upon him, said in the authentic Hadith: 'The stronghold (Fustat) of the Muslims on the day of the Great Battle (Al-Malhama Al-Kubra) is in Al-Ghouta, next to a city called Damascus, it is the best of the cities of Al-Sham on that day.'

If we retrace our steps to the first era, the generation which the Messenger, peace be upon him, testified for as being the best of people, the Companions. No one with knowledge and insight doubts that they were upon this methodology, meaning: the methodology of the Book and Sunnah. But were all of them knowledgeable of the Book and Sunnah? No. Ibn al-Qayyim and others mention that the scholars among the Companions who were known for giving Fatwas to the thousands of Companions, their number barely reaches two hundred Companions. Barely reaching this number, increasing a little or decreasing. And the rest deduce and rely on these. So history repeats itself. So whoever adopts the methodology of Ahlul-Hadith and Ahlus-Sunnah is from the Victorious Sect. Therefore, when I am asked on the occasion of the Hadith: 'My Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one. They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: It is the Jama'ah (Community),' and in a narration: 'It is that upon which I and my companions are.'\nThe Sheikh: They say: They wonder or ask: Is such and such party or such and such group from the seventy-two sects? I say: It is not permissible to answer; that they are from the sect, from a sect of the seventy-two or not? Why? Because I know by experience that there are individuals among them who adopt the methodology of Ahlul-Hadith and Sunnah. So their Creed is upon the Creed of the Salaf, their prayer and fasting likewise. All that is in the matter is that they became partisans, and this partisanship and they formed blocks, this forming of blocks with the claim that Islam cannot be established except with this block. So these are partisans but despite that they are upon the methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah and they are from Ahlul-Hadith.\n\nIntervention: Yes.\n\nThe Sheikh: Huh? This is the answer to what you asked.",

In whatever school it is, and from whatever sect its narrator was, as long as he is a trustworthy Muslim. Even if he was a Shiite, or Qadari, or Khariji, let alone being Hanafi or Maliki or other than that. Imam Al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, explicitly stated this when he addressed Imam Ahmad saying: 'You are more knowledgeable about Hadith than me. So if a Hadith comes to you authentic, inform me of it so I can go to it, whether it is Hijazi, Kufi, or Egyptian.' So Ahlul-Hadith - may Allah gather us with them - are not fanatical for the saying of a specific person no matter how high and elevated he is, except Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. Contrary to others who do not belong to Hadith and acting upon it, for they are fanatical for the sayings of their Imams - and they forbade them from that - just as Ahlul-Hadith are fanatical for the sayings of their Prophet!! So no wonder after this explanation that Ahlul-Hadith are the Dominant Sect and the Saved Sect, rather the Middle Nation, witnesses over creation.\nI admire in this regard the saying of Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi in the introduction of his book 'Sharaf Ashab Al-Hadith' (The Honor of the People of Hadith) in support of them and refuting those who opposed them: 'If the person of blameworthy opinion busied himself with beneficial sciences, and sought the Sunan of the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds, and followed the traces of the Jurists and Muhaddithin, he would find in that what suffices him from other than it. And he would suffice with the tradition (Athar) over his opinion which he sees. Because Hadith includes knowledge of the principles of Tawhid, and the clarification of what came regarding the aspects of promise and threat, and the Attributes of the Lord of the Worlds - Exalted above the sayings of the atheists - and informing about the description of Paradise and Hell, and what Allah prepared in them for the pious and the wicked, and what Allah created in the earths and heavens and the types of wonders and great signs, and the mention of the Close Angels, and the description of those arranging [in ranks] and exalting.

Their lights are shining, their virtues are prevalent, their signs are dazzling, their schools are manifest, and their arguments are compelling. Every group leans towards a desire it returns to, and deems good an opinion it relies upon, except the People of Hadith. For the Book is their equipment, the Sunnah is their argument, the Messenger is their party, and to him is their attribution. They do not turn to desires, nor pay attention to opinions. What they narrated from the Messenger is accepted from them, and they are the trusted ones regarding him, the just. Preservers of the religion and its treasurers, vessels of knowledge and its carriers. If there is disagreement in a Hadith, to them is the return. So whatever they judge with, it is the accepted heard. Among them is every knowledgeable Jurist, and high noble Imam, and ascetic in a tribe, and one distinguished by virtue, and proficient reciter, and excellent preacher. They are the great majority and their path is the Straight Path. Every innovator pretends to their belief, and does not dare to explicitly state other than their schools. Whoever plots against them Allah breaks him, and whoever opposes them Allah forsakes him. He who abandons them does not harm them, nor succeeds he who separates from them.

Their concern is preserving traditions, crossing deserts and wastelands, riding land and sea in acquiring what the Chosen Messenger legislated. They do not turn away from him to opinion or desire. They accepted his Sharia in word and deed, and guarded his Sunnah by preservation and transmission, until they established thereby its foundation, and they were most worthy of it and its people. How many an atheist seeks to mix with the Sharia what is not of it, and Allah Almighty defends it with the People of Hadith. They are the preservers of its pillars, and the establishers of its command and affair. If defense of it is turned away from, they struggle for it. Those are the party of Allah.

They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: It is the Jama'ah.' This is the answer. But this answer raises a question, so the answer must be detailed. If we understand the Jama'ah intended by this Hadith is the answer to the question posed just now. The interpretation of this answer, which is the Jama'ah, came in another narration, which is his saying, peace be upon him: 'It is that which is upon what I and my companions are upon.' So then look, O lost Muslim in the midst of these groups existing today among Muslims in every country, let alone the entire Islamic world.

Groups you consider upon the Book and Sunnah, and their deeds upon the Book and Sunnah, and their morals likewise.

What is your opinion on what you heard that a Muslim cannot be from the Saved Sect unless he knows the authentic Hadith from the weak first, and consequently takes this knowledge as a means to know what the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, was upon, then know what the Companions were upon. What is your opinion on this?

I might die before this happens. So we want in our reality now there are famous and apparent sects... and I, meaning I believe that everyone wishes to know the principles of these people. I was, meaning I will announce about myself a little, I was, meaning at a banquet and I am a Friday preacher, I was opposing the Shia because I was in reality a Tawhid teacher in Saudi Arabia and I knew much about them. So many of our brothers sent me threats because Khomeini in his opinion is the caller to Islam and establishing an Islamic state. So to convince them I have to tell them go read Mustalah al-Hadith, and the life of the Companions, and the Quran, this is a long path and cannot be walked. So we want from your virtue to clarify for us actually the sects existing now, for example the Alawites, Ismailis, Shia with their types [in a] brief [form]. And I believe that Allah Glorified and Exalted has mentioned that in Surah Al-Hashr because He classified Muslims into three types, Muhajirin and Ansar and those who came after them saying Our Lord forgive us and our brothers {And those who came after them, saying, \"Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful.\"} [Al-Hashr: 10].

Unreasonable and real.\n\nThe Sheikh: So then I tell you unreasonable you say to me this phrase there are many things unreasonable happened.

This is Islam, about which our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, said in the Quran: {And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.} [Al Imran: 85]. This is a reality about which there is no doubt or uncertainty among any of the Muslims; yet, we do not pause at it often. Rather, I wish to draw attention to what we have been and still are always and forever discussing—and this is our duty, we the callers to the Book and the Sunnah, and upon the methodology of the Pious Predecessors (Salaf As-Salih)—that this Islam, other than which Allah, Blessed and Exalted, accepts from no human being, which we ought to know well, is not this Islam that is known today among many Muslims, let alone others. That is because this Islam, revealed to the heart of the Messenger, upon him be blessings and peace, has had things enter into it which are not from it, in terms of creed, jurisprudence, and behavior. Therefore, we always discuss holding fast to this pure, purified Islam which he, upon him be blessings and peace, brought and explained to the noble Companions, and which was then transmitted to us by the Successors from the Predecessors through authentic chains of narration known to the people of Hadith and Sunnah. For this reason, we advise the Muslim youth in every time and in every place, especially in this time in which various tribulations (fitan) of every kind have multiplied, from all causes of difference that bring about the division forbidden by our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, in more than one verse. Our Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, clarified this in many Hadiths, of which you know the good parts—if Allah, Blessed and Exalted, wills. However, I want to remind you of one Hadith, which is his saying, upon him be blessings and peace: «I have left you upon a clear white [plain], its night is like its day, no one deviates from it except he is destroyed», and in another wording: «except a deviator». Therefore, protection when tribulations surround the Muslims is only the return to Allah, to the Book of Allah, and to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, and upon what...",

He said: «It is the Jama'ah (the Group/Community).» Meaning the Jama'ah of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, to whom the meaning of his saying, upon him be blessings and peace, in the well-known authentic Hadith is directed first and foremost: «My nation will not unite upon misguidance.» The first intended by this Hadith is the nation of the Companions of the Messenger, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, for they are the ones who did not unite upon misguidance. As for those who came after them, among them are those who deviated from the straight line which the Messenger, upon him be peace, drew as an illustration and practical application, as is derived regarding the illustration from the Hadith narrated by Al-Hakim in «Al-Mustadrak» from Abdullah bin Mas'ud—may Allah, the Exalted, be pleased with him—that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace: drew a straight line on the ground one day, then he drew short lines around this straight line, then he, upon him be blessings and peace, recited over that straight line: {And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way.} [Al-An'am: 153]. And he, upon him be blessings and peace, said while pointing to the straight line: «This is the path of Allah», and pointing to the short lines around it, he, upon him be peace, said: «These are ways, and at the head of every way among them is a devil calling people to it.» These ways were and still are in continuous increase, especially at the end of time.

But here, who are the ones, or rather who is the one, who knows this white path that the Messenger, upon him be blessings and peace, left for us pure? And he threatened the one who deviates from it as being a destroyed deviator? There is no doubt that the one or those who know this pure white methodology are only the Victorious Group (At-Ta'ifah Al-Mansurah) about which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, spoke in a Mutawatir (consecutively recurrent) Hadith established from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, through definitively proven paths, which is his saying, upon him be blessings and peace: «A group of my nation will not cease to be manifest upon the truth; they will not be harmed by those who oppose them until the Hour is established.» They will not be harmed by those who oppose them. Are they the overwhelming majority of Muslims, or are they the small Victorious Group? The Hadith is explicit regarding that. Therefore, let not the concern of any of you be to be with the majority; because Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, censures the majority in most verses of the Noble Quran with sayings like: {But most of the people do not know} [Al-A'raf: 187], {But most of the people are not grateful} [Al-Baqarah: 243], {And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah} [Al-An'am: 116]. Therefore, the concern of one of us should be to be among His few servants, from the Victorious Group. What is the description of this Victorious Group? Here is the crux of the matter in this word: it is what was mentioned in the Hadiths of 'Strangeness' (Ghuraba). The Hadiths of Strangeness came in three authentic narrations: The first narration: In Sahih Muslim from the narration of Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas—may Allah, the Exalted, be pleased with him—who said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, said: «Verily Islam began as a stranger and will return as a stranger as it began, so give glad tidings (Tuuba) to the strangers.» This is Muslim's Hadith.

So he, upon him be blessings and peace, said: «They are a few righteous people among many people; those who disobey them are more than those who obey them.» Look here, he praises the few, and does not praise the many; rather he censures them. He said: «They are a few righteous people among many people; those who disobey them are more than those who obey them.» So then, from the description of these strangers whom the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, gave glad tidings of 'Tuuba'—and it is a tree in Paradise under which a speeding rider travels for a hundred years without traversing it—these are the strangers whom the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, gave this great glad tiding to, saying: «They are a few righteous people among many people; those who disobey them are more than those who obey them.» This description should be a general description of the strangers. As for the following description, which is in the third Hadith, it is a description of the elite of the strangers, it is a description of the elite of the strangers, meaning it is a description of the scholars of the strangers; and that is that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, once answered that question: 'Who are the strangers?' So he, upon him be blessings and peace, said in the other instance: «They are those who correct what people have corrupted of my Sunnah after me.» So then, the word 'strangers' means: those who hold fast to the Book and the Sunnah and are upon the understanding of the Predecessors (Salaf); meaning they are the Saved Sect. But it is not necessary that every individual who is truly from the Saved Sect be a scholar; this is a very necessary point. Furthermore, it is not necessary that everyone who is from the Saved Sect, and is also a scholar, be a scholar of the Book and the Sunnah [directly from the texts]; he might be a scholar from the scholars who follow a school of thought (Madhhab) from the schools of the guided, followed Imams, but he is unable to distinguish the correct from the incorrect in what people differed over, he is unable to distinguish the Sunnah from the innovation (Bid'ah) when the Sunnah has mixed with innovations, and how abundant this mixing is in this time.",

Therefore, whoever lives and whoever realizes [the truth] among you in this time which is agitated with various tribulations, it is upon him first and foremost to be from the Saved Sect. And for this, it is not necessary that he be a scholar; because it is not an individual obligation (Fard 'Ayn) upon every Muslim to be a scholar; but it is an individual obligation upon every Muslim to know what is required of him regarding his creed, regarding his worship, and regarding his individual behavior that is individually obligatory upon him. So if he is not a scholar, as is the case of the general people, here comes the saying of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, in the Noble Quran: {So ask the people of the message [Ahl al-Dhikr] if you do not know} [An-Nahl: 43]. There is no doubt that before these general people apply this verse, they must know axiomatically who the 'People of the Message' are. The People of the Message are the People of the Quran. And the People of the Quran are not those who [merely] read the Quran and excel in its recitation and reading well, yet they hardly understand anything of it, even a little; these are not the People of the Quran. The People of the Quran whom the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, praised in a specific Hadith, which is his saying: «The People of the Quran are the People of Allah and His special ones.» The People of the Quran are the People of Allah and His special ones; they are those who understand the Quran and interpret it according to what was upon it at the time of its revelation to the heart of the Prophet, upon him be blessings and peace, meaning upon what our Pious Predecessors were upon. These are the People of the Message whom the general Muslims must ask. It is very regrettable that these are the few whom the Messenger, may Allah bless him and his family and grant them peace, pointed to in his first and second answers specifically.

The transmission from the Imams of Hadith has already been presented regarding the interpretation of the Victorious Group: that they are the People of Knowledge of Hadith and the People of Athar (Traditions). By necessity, you know that not everyone from the Saved Sect is from the People of Knowledge in general, let alone from the People of Knowledge specifically. Do you not see that the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, are the ones who represent the Saved Sect, and for that reason, we were commanded to hold fast to what they were upon? Yet, despite that, they were not all scholars; rather, the majority of them were followers of their scholars. So, between the 'Group' (Ta'ifah) and the 'Sect' (Firqah), there is a clear relationship of generality and specificity. However, despite that, I do not see great benefit in debating this issue back and forth, out of concern for the Call (Da'wah) and the unity of the word. «As-Sahihah» (1/ 2/932).",

How do we understand the Salafi Da'wah (Call) as preachers? \nThe Sheikh: Explain the question to me so I can answer. \nIntervention: I meant as preachers; because, as you know, preachers today are many, especially those who claim Salafism, and perhaps problems arise between them regarding the understanding of certain issues. So there must be a general understanding of the Salafi Da'wah as an introduction to the Da'wah. \nThe Sheikh: The answer to this question was a long lecture just yesterday in Jerash, or rather north of Amman with the brother... there is a detailed tape on this, and perhaps there are also multiple tapes. So I will summarize the answer based on that, and I say: Salafi preachers must always and forever focus on defining to all people—whether they are preachers or those being preached to—the reality of the Islamic Salafi Da'wah, which is distinguished in its reality from all other calls that attribute themselves to Islam as a whole. All Islamic calls, old and new, adopt the Book and the Sunnah, except for those who deviated from some groups in the present era and individuals in ancient eras who used to declare that their call was based on the Book only, without the Sunnah. This, undoubtedly, we do not need to prolong speech about; because it is a matter agreed upon that whoever restricts their understanding of Islam to the Quran is not a Muslim; because the Quran itself commands Muslims to obey Allah and His Messenger, and to seek judgment",

"text": "from Allah and His Messenger. So this point, we do not need to delve into, especially since those who belong today to this methodology that opposes the Book and the Sunnah—and they are those called the Quranists—their misguidance is clear. However, all other groups that meet with us in being within the circle of Islam, and adopt the Book and the Sunnah with us, it is obligatory upon Salafi preachers specifically to clarify to these people that the Salafi Da'wah is distinguished from all other calls in that it understands the Book and the Sunnah according to what the Pious Predecessors (Salaf Salih) were upon, from the Companions, the Successors (Tabi'in), and those who followed them. As came in the Mutawatir Hadith from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, who said: «The best of people are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them». So we add to the Book and the Sunnah the methodology of the Pious Predecessors. This addition is not an innovation as many people might imagine, but rather it is textually stipulated in the Book and the Sunnah. As for the Book, it is His saying, the Most High: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115]. And as for the Sunnah, there are two famous Hadiths. One of them is the Hadith of the Saved Sect, which is well-known and there is no need to recite it verbatim, but we cite the witness from it, which is his saying, peace be upon him, when he was asked about the Saved Sect, so he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, answered by saying: «It is that which I and my companions are upon». And the other Hadith is the Hadith of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, which is his saying, peace be upon him, in the Hadith of Irbadh bin Sariyah: «So hold fast to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Mahdi Caliphs after me...» to the end of it. So in this Hadith is the clarification of the 'way of the believers' which was mentioned in the previous verse: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115].",

"text": "Therefore: Preachers must focus on this distinguishing addition of the Call of Truth, which manifests the Saved Sect over the other sects, which is that they must be upon what the Pious Predecessors were upon. But this requires something I did not mention yesterday, and it is mentioned in many recordings: that applying this rule to the methodology of the Pious Predecessors requires Salafi preachers to be concerned with knowing the Salafi Athar (narrations/traditions) just as they are concerned with knowing the Prophetic Hadiths; because knowing these Athar is what achieves for them the practical and correct application of this methodology. And these Athar, just as is the case with Hadiths, contain the authentic and the weak; likewise, the Athar contain the authentic and the weak. Therefore, here one must pay attention to what I will say. Many of the books of scholars, like Fath al-Bari by Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani and those who came after him, when they use some Athar as evidence, they do not scrutinize their chains of narration (Isnads). Here lies a very clear error; because if we want to say that such-and-such Companion or such-and-such female Companion used to say such-and-such or do such-and-such, and we consider that as a clarification of a verse in the Book of Allah or a Hadith in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, then the meaning of that is we must be certain of the authenticity of that Athar or those Athar. This is what the Muslim Salafi preacher should be knowledgeable about first, and base his call and clarification of what he is upon secondly. Then, the Salafi Da'wah is distinguished not just by mere calling, but practically, that it seeks to understand Islam correctly from all its aspects, not from some aspects that some groups concern themselves with to the exclusion of other aspects, calling the former matters 'priorities'. And the matter in this division of Islam or knowledge of Islam might lead them to make it into two parts: a kernel (Lub) and a shell (Qishr). So they concern themselves, in their claim—while the reality is that they",

"text": "do not even concern themselves with this part they called the kernel—they concern themselves with it without concerning themselves with the other part. And I draw attention to a scientific truth: if the Muslim is clear about it, it becomes evident that there is absolutely no room for a scholar researching the Book and the Sunnah to divide Islam into kernel and shell. This, if it were possible, would only be possible for someone who encompassed Islam in knowledge, and this is almost impossible; because Allah Almighty says: {And they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills} [Al-Baqarah: 255]. Therefore, the duty of the Muslim preacher is to convey Islam to people as a whole within the limits of his knowledge, and not to claim the division mentioned earlier: kernel and shells; because Islam is all good and blessing. And if this division were accepted, we would say that the shell is necessary to preserve the kernel, as is the case and matter we see in our daily lives, where we eat many fruits and produce, and for them to be good for us, we must preserve them with their peels/shells. This is by way of example and approximation. But in reality, we do not accept this naming, to say that Islam is kernel and shell. However, we say there are things that must be known first, then must be acted upon second. And there are other things that must be known as knowledge by a group of people who are the People of Knowledge, and this is what is called by scholars 'Fard Kifa'i' (Communal Obligation). Then, from the practical side as well, its performance is obligatory upon a group without being obligatory upon every individual Muslim. Then, from what came in the Sunnah—and with this I conclude the answer to this question—is that what is not obligatory may be an aid to one who may have fallen short in an obligatory duty. I mean by that the well-known Hadith from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, that he said: «The first thing for which the servant is held accountable on the Day of Resurrection is the prayer. If it is complete, he has succeeded and prospered. And if it is deficient, he has failed and lost». And it came in another Hadith: «If it is deficient, Allah Almighty says to His angels: Look, does My servant have any voluntary deeds (Tatawwu'), so complete for him his obligatory duty with it».",

"text": "Therefore: The voluntary act which is not obligatory, a Muslim should not be negligent of it under the claim that it is not obligatory; because this claim would only be accepted if we accepted for the sake of argument that the Muslim, when he performs what is obligatory upon him, performs it in the most perfect manner, and not in the deficient manner which the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, pointed to in the Hadith known among scholars as the Hadith of 'The One Who Prayed Badly' (Al-Musie' Salatahu). Wherein the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, was sitting with his companions in the mosque when a man entered and prayed, then came to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, and said: «Peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allah! So he, peace be upon him, said: And upon you be peace, go back and pray, for you have not prayed. And so on, briefly, three times he repeats the prayer, and each time the Messenger, peace be upon him, says: Go back and pray, for you have not prayed. Finally, when the man realized he did not know how to pray better, he said: By Allah, O Messenger of Allah! I do not know how to do better than this, so teach me. So he, peace be upon him, said to him: When you stand for prayer, perform ablution as Allah commanded you, then call the Adhan, then the Iqamah, then face the Qiblah, then say Takbir...» to the end of the Hadith. So, I wonder, are the general worshippers today certain and reassured within themselves that they pray a complete prayer such that they will not need, on the day deeds are weighed in the Scale of Justice, that they will not find deficiency in their prayers? We, as we witness in the mosques and outside the mosques, most people pray yet do not pray. Therefore, it appears to you very strongly the necessity of caring for the Sunan (plural of Sunnah/voluntary acts); because they are like a reserve for the spiritual life of faith, just as in the material human life here; as these Sunan are a cause to complete the deficiency that may occur in the obligatory duty. This deficiency is of two types: a deficiency in quantity and a deficiency in quality. Meaning: a man might miss three prayers without a legal excuse, so he is not only sinful but has also lost a great reward. This is the first deficiency, the deficiency of quantity. And the other deficiency is in quality, which the Hadith of 'The One Who Prayed Badly' guided you to; for he prays but falls short in its pillars, let alone its form.",

Meaning: whether it was a deficiency in quantity or a deficiency in quality. Therefore: Islam must be understood and learned from all its aspects without differentiation as we said earlier in our expression: what is obligatory or voluntary, and in their expression: kernel or shell. Then after that, people must rise to perform what they can of the first section, which is the individual obligations. I say this because many people today among those who share with us in the Call to the Book and the Sunnah, then separate from us by not caring for the Salafi Athar and the Salafi Methodology—many of these people concern themselves with the call for when the Muslim State is established. And this establishment is an obligatory matter, there is no doubt, about which no two differ. But what is the way to establish the Muslim State and achieve ruling by Islam, Book and Sunnah? Is it through ignorance of Islam, or is it through understanding it completely and then calling to act upon it as the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, began; where he began by teaching people Tawhid (Monotheism), the correct Creed? Then after that, as you know—and this does not need prolongation—the legal rulings began to follow successively through prayer, through fasting. The last thing to be obligated, as you know, was Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah, then the other rulings of prohibitions, forbidden things, legal punishments (Hudud), and the like. Therefore: The Da'wah must be as a whole, and the application is according to ability, and the preparation for establishing the Muslim State is by acting upon what we have learned of our true religion. This is what is available to me to answer this question. (Al-Huda wan-Noor / 620/ 42: 00: 00)",

This is what our Prophet, peace be upon him, declared in the authentic Hadith narrated by Imam Al-Bukhari in his Sahih: «Three are given their reward twice...» and he mentioned among them: «And a man from the Christians who believed in me and submitted (became Muslim), so he has his reward twice». This means that he was a believer before in the Sharia of Jesus, peace be upon him, then when the truth became clear to him that what Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, brought is the truth as well, he believed in him, so his reward is written for him twice. It is not the case for one who was from the Christians as an atheist, neither Christian nor Muslim, then became Muslim; this one has his reward once. But the one who was actually a Christian, despite the deviation in it, and is a believer, he has his reward twice. I say 'despite the deviation in the Christians'; because the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, when he spoke this Hadith and said: «He has his reward twice», he meant the Christians who were in his time, peace and blessings be upon him. And the Christians about whom Allah Almighty said in the clear Quran: {They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"Allah is the third of three.\"} [Al-Ma'idah: 73]. And these are the ones whose slaughtered meat was made permissible for us. Therefore, a Muslim should not doubt and question about these Christians saying: 'They say the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one God.' We say: They were likewise in the era of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and they are the ones meant by the Lord of Mankind in the previous verse: {They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"Allah is the third of",

Therefore: Any man from the People of the Book who submits (becomes Muslim) and believes in Allah and His Messenger has his reward twice: once for his previous faith with all its flaws and faults, and another time for his subsequent faith which is all truth with no falsehood in it. So we ask Allah first for steadfastness for you, then uprightness on the truth. And this obligates you—and the Religion is sincere advice—to be keen on learning the correct Islam. And I say with regret: 'the correct Islam'; because what befell those before them has befallen the Muslims. What befell the Jews and Christians of division in religion has befallen the Muslims. And this is the confirmation of the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: «You will surely follow the ways of those before you, handspan by handspan and cubit by cubit, until even if they entered a lizard's hole, you would enter it. They said: The Jews and Christians, O Messenger of Allah?! He said: Who else?!» Meaning: They are the ones who have the power and the state on that day. So this news has come true in most Muslims today: 'You will surely follow the ways of those before you handspan by handspan' to the end of it. So the Muslims have divided. Therefore, since Allah Almighty has blessed you with the Greatest Guidance, which is the first one—that Allah Almighty saved you from polytheistic idolatrous Christianity to Islam, which first commands people to worship Allah alone with no partner, then commands all Muslims to believe in all the laws that were before Islam. Not like the Jews who believe only in the Torah, and not like the Christians who believe only in the Torah and the Gospel despite the distortion, change, and alteration in them. Muslims are commanded religiously to believe in everything Allah sent down before, and in every Prophet or Messenger sent before. So as long as our Lord Almighty guided you to this Islam which contains the creed of Tawhid first, then bearing witness to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, that he is truly a Messenger and Prophet, then you have nothing left but to continue the path and know what the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, brought regarding matters in which people differed.

Here comes the witness—and it has sensitivity, and I hope you take a lesson from it after Allah guided you to Islam: If all the Christians present today in the land of Islam were invited to one of these three characteristics: Either they become Muslim—they are not forced into Islam; because Allah Almighty says: {There is no compulsion in religion.

He did not repeat the command for obedience a third time, so He did not say 'and obey Allah and obey the Messenger and obey those in authority among you', no. The subtle point is that obedience to the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, considering that it is revelation from the heavens, does not accept error. So whoever obeys the Messenger has certainly obeyed Allah. Therefore He said: {Obey Allah and obey the Messenger}. As for those in authority, their obedience is due to their obedience to the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. If they obey the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, it becomes obligatory upon us to obey them. And if they do not obey the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, it is not obligatory upon us to obey them. And there is a very famous Hadith: «There is no obedience to a creature in disobedience to the Creator». It has an occasion: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, sent a reconnaissance party (Sariyah)—meaning a small army—one day, and appointed a commander over them, and commanded the subordinates to obey this commander. So the commander wanted to test the members of his army: do they obey him or not? So he commanded them to bring firewood which they gathered from the desert. So he commanded them to gather firewood and they gathered it. Then he said to them: Gather around it, so they gathered. Then he said to them: Light the fire, so they lit it. Then he said to them: Throw yourselves into it. So they paused, and looked at one another. They said: By Allah, we did not believe in the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, except to flee from the fire; shall we throw ourselves into the fire? He said: By Allah, we will not do so until we ask the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. So they asked the Messenger, peace be upon him, and told him the story. [He said]: «By the One in whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad! Had you thrown yourselves into it, you would not have come out of it until the Hour is established. There is no obedience to a creature in disobedience to the Creator». The witness, therefore: Obedience to parents is like obedience to those in authority. These are obeyed in obedience",

"text": "to Allah and the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. If they disobey Allah and the Messenger, then there is no obedience to them. For example, the son became Muslim but his father is not pleased with his Islam. We say in the Syrian expression: «May he never be pleased»; because it is sufficient that Allah is pleased with him. As that noble Companion Khubayb bin 'Adi said: 'I do not care when I am killed as a Muslim... on which side my fall was for the sake of Allah'. I do not care if my mother or my father is not pleased with my Islam. There is no obedience to a creature in disobedience to the Creator. But here is a word that must be delivered to complete the previous one. You, even if Allah Almighty blessed you and you separated from them, leaving their misguidance for the guidance of Islam, your obedience to parents still remains obligatory upon you with the previous restriction, meaning: without disobedience [to Allah]. So your service to them must—I do not say remain as it was—rather it must improve from what it was, but in obedience other than [disobedience to] Allah. For example, they said to you: Bring such-and-such item, give us such-and-such Dinars, and you are able, then you must answer them. But if they said to you: Here are five Dinars, buy us wine. You say: Pardon me, «There is no obedience to a creature in disobedience to the Creator». Therefore: You should remain in obedience to them as long as they do not command you to disobey. And it came in Sahih Al-Bukhari—perhaps you have heard of something called Sahih Al-Bukhari? \nIntervention: Yes. \nThe Sheikh: Praise be to Allah. This is the most authentic of books that narrate the biography of the Messenger, peace be upon him, his hadiths, his sayings, his actions, and his guidance. It came in this book that Asma bint Abi Bakr, her mother came to her while she was a polytheist (Mushrik), and she was residing in her polytheism in Mecca. So she came visiting her daughter Asma bint Abi Bakr while she was in Medina. So she asked the Messenger, peace be upon him: Should she maintain ties with her? Meaning: Honor her with something? So he, peace be upon him, commanded her to do that, despite the difference between them: she is a Muslim and her mother is a pagan polytheist.",

What is the difference in your differentiation between those and the People of the Book who live among us in the Arab lands or Muslim lands?

So we want to hear from you, O our Sheikh... \nThe Sheikh: In any case, we are your guests, so we have nothing but to comply with your command. \nIntervention: May Allah reward you with good. \nThe Sheikh: I pointed out earlier that those Christians who were in the era of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were, in the creed of Islam and the explicit text of the Quran, polytheists. They used to say: Allah is the third of three. So the Quran explicitly stated their disbelief: {They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"Allah is the third of three.\"} [Al-Ma'idah: 73]. And I also said with this, our Lord Almighty inspired His Prophet, peace be upon him, to say that among the three who are given their reward twice are the People of the Book if one of them becomes Muslim, he has his reward twice. In the era of the revelation of that verse or others, including the verse the Professor mentioned: {And the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you} [Al-Ma'idah: 5], there was no monotheistic Christian or Messiah-following society or nation or even people. These did not exist. There were individuals who did not represent the Christian nation, nor even a people from the many peoples of the Christians. Rather, all of them were polytheists; they used to say: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one God. Despite that, Allah Almighty said regarding them: {And the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you} [Al-Ma'idah: 5]. This verse does not mean their food absolutely; because among their food are things prohibited with certainty in Islam, for example, the pig, pork is from the food of the Christians. But the noble verse: {And the food of those who were given the Scripture} [Al-Ma'idah: 5] does not mean: what they eat, whether it is lawful in the Sharia of Islam or prohibited. Rather, it means 'slaughtered animals' instead of 'food', so the Muslim interprets",

"text": "'Food' here as 'the slaughtered animal' (Dhabihah). Meaning: And the slaughtered animals of those who were given the Scripture are lawful for you. This is what the Interpreter of the Quran, Abdullah bin Abbas, the cousin of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, and the most famous of the Companions, nay the most knowledgeable of them in Tafsir (exegesis) and encompassing it, said. Therefore: His saying, the Most High: {And the food of those} [Al-Ma'idah: 5] means: And the slaughtered animals of those who were given the Scripture before you are lawful for you. Now, there is a difference that still exists between the People of the Book residing in Islamic lands, and the People of the Book residing in the lands of Kufr (disbelief), Shirk (polytheism), Fisq (immorality), and Dalal (misguidance). Here, as far as we know, they still slaughter animals just as Muslims slaughter them. As for in the West and in America, they slaughter, [or rather] they do not even slaughter, but they kill by killing [stunning/shocking]. These carcasses that come to us under the name of 'slaughtered animals' (Dhabai'h), the ruling in Islam revolves around one of three cases: If we know that they slaughtered properly and did not kill [by shocking/beating] and they are People of the Book, then their slaughtered animals are like the slaughtered animals of the People of the Book in Islamic lands; they are Halal (lawful). And if we know that they do not slaughter, but rather kill by killing, then their carcasses in this case are not Halal, but rather they are Haram (unlawful). And if the matter revolves between this and that, meaning: the eater does not know if this is a killed animal or a slaughtered animal, then a third command comes, which is to be cautious for his religion as he, peace be upon him, said in the authentic Hadith: «The Halal is clear and the Haram is clear, and between them are ambiguous matters which many people do not know. So whoever avoids the suspicious matters has absolved his religion and his honor. Verily, every king has a sanctuary, and verily Allah's sanctuary is His prohibitions. Verily, whoever grazes around the sanctuary is bound to fall into it...» to the end of the Hadith. And the other Hadith: «Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt».",

"text": "And there is a third Hadith I mention for the loftiness of its meaning and its precision, while noting the lack of its authenticity as a narration from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family... (There was a cut here) \nIntervention: So Adam was more similar [to the miraculous creation] as he was from neither a father nor a mother, and resembled Eve who is from Adam. So He [Jesus] is from a female without a male, contrary to the rest of people, and he is a Sign from the Signs of Allah, Blessed and Most High, but he is the slave of Allah and His Messenger. So why did they not say about Adam that he is the son of Allah? Why did they not say about Eve that she is the daughter of Allah? Yet they came and said about Jesus that he is the son of Allah; because he was created from a female without a male. So they have no rational proof for that, let alone having textual proof. Therefore: Here they are confused and contradictory. You discuss with them on these points only with this, to show their misguidance in that, and that they are not upon anything. Just as you clarify to them that Jesus gave glad tidings, and the glad tidings are still in the Torah, even the distorted one. Read regarding that in the modern books what this Ahmed Deedat wrote, and others, and what others mentioned regarding the mention of the glad tidings by the name of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, and that there is still mention of the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, in the distorted Torah and Gospel. For Allah Almighty said: {And [recall, O People of the Scripture], when Allah took the covenant of the prophets, [saying], \"Whatever I give you of the Scripture and wisdom and then there comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you, you [must] believe in him and support him.\" [Allah] said, \"Have you acknowledged and taken upon that My commitment?\" They said, \"We have acknowledged it.\" He said, \"Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.\"} [Al-Imran: 81]. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, says in Sahih Al-Bukhari: Allah never sent a prophet except that He took the covenant and pledge from him, that if Muhammad is sent while he is alive, he must believe in him and support him. Every prophet, Jesus and those before him, peace be upon them, Allah took the covenant from them that if Allah sends Muhammad while they are alive, they would believe in him, support him, and be among his followers. Likewise, Allah took the covenant and pledge from them that they take the covenant and pledge from their people",

And without that, they have no path to Paradise. And Jesus, upon him be peace and blessings, concerning whom it was one of Allah's Signs that Allah raised him to Himself—and this is what the Christians were misguided by—will descend and come down to the earth and rule by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family and companions.

The Jama'ah that the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, intends in this Hadith is the Jama'ah that he intended in a Hadith known to you, so I will mention the last part of it: «And my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one. They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: It is the Jama'ah». This is the Jama'ah. And in another narration clarifying the Jama'ah, he said: «It is what I and my companions are upon». Does this answer suffice you as a clarification? \nIntervention: Yes. \nThe Sheikh: May Allah reward you with good.",

"text": "Therefore: Every group on the face of the earth today—every group on the face of the earth today that does not affiliate itself with the First Jama'ah, then it is firstly in danger. It is firstly in two dangers: That it be from the perishable sects, not the saved one. And secondly: It is not the Jama'ah for which the blood of the one who exits from it and separates from the Jama'ah becomes lawful to shed. In truth, this Hadith, the Hadith of the Sects, should be the methodology of every Muslim, especially in this time when groups and sects have multiplied, and every sect among them claims that it is upon the truth. I see it as incumbent upon me to expand a little regarding that Hadith of the Sects; because it is impossible that the Islamic groups existing today in the Islamic lands are all in the Fire. This is impossible. Just as it is completely impossible: that they are all in Paradise. This is the opposite of this, and this is the opposite of that, and it is all impossible religiously (Shar'an). Why? Because Allah Almighty mentioned in the Noble Quran legal facts that there is no room for any Muslim to deny: Among these facts: {But most of the people do not know} [Al-A'raf: 187]. {But most of the people are not grateful} [Al-Baqarah: 243]. {And few of My servants are grateful} [Saba: 13]. {And most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with Him} [Yusuf: 106].

"text": "the Messenger, peace be upon him—and whose function is: clarifying what is in the Quran—we see in all these texts that the majority is always the blameworthy one, and the minority is the praised one. This is from one angle. And from another angle: We see our Lord Almighty forbidding division in religion, and making that among the characteristics and nature of the polytheists. So the Lord of the Worlds said: {And do not be of those who associate others with Allah * [Or] of those who have divided their religion and become sects, every faction rejoicing in what it has} [Ar-Rum: 31 - 32]. Therefore: Division in the Quran is blameworthy. Rather, the Messenger, peace be upon him, clarified that with the most complete clarification, so he said, peace and blessings be upon him, in the Hadith of the Sects which I pointed to earlier, and now we mention it fully exactly as it came in Sunan At-Tirmidhi and Musnad Ahmad and other books of Sunnah from a group of Companions, among them: Abu Hurairah, Muawiyah, Anas bin Malik, and other Companions. So he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: «The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians split into seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one. They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: It is the Jama'ah». This Jama'ah is the one which it is not permissible to exit from, and the one who exits from it is the one who deserves that severe ruling rightfully, which is: that his blood becomes lawful for his separating from the Jama'ah. What is this Jama'ah? Its interpretation has come implicitly in the Quran, and explicitly in this Hadith of the Messenger, peace be upon him. As for the Quran, He, Almighty as a Speaker, said: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115]. Here you see with me that Allah Almighty mentioned in this verse 'the way of the believers', after mentioning the Messenger, peace be upon him. So He said: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows",

"text": "other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115]. Do you think if the verse were without the phrase 'the way of the believers', if it were a shortened context from this context, for example: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him - We will give him what he has taken...} to the end of the verse. Do you think we would lose anything or not? Meaning: in many cases, an explanatory and clarifying phrase comes. Is this phrase by way of clarification of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned in this verse of the Quran, or does it contain an added benefit beyond what is contained in the word of the Messenger, peace be upon him: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115]? Why did Allah mention: 'and follows other than the way of the believers'? Is it not sufficient for him that he opposed the Messenger? It is sufficient, but why was: 'and follows other than the way of the believers' mentioned? Here is the Quranic eloquence, here is the Quranic inimitability. He mentioned 'the way of the believers'; so that they would be a role model for those who come after them, for the likes of us. So it is not permissible for us to come, for example, to the text in the Quran or in the Hadith of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and interpret it ourselves with an interpretation that contradicts what the first believers before us were upon. And the first believers before us—who are the ones intended in this verse of our Lord mentioned earlier in the Quran—are none other than those testified for with goodness in his authentic saying, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family—rather, mutawatir in authenticity from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family: «The best of people are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them». These who were purified by the tongue of the Messenger, peace be upon him. As for those after them, the Messenger, peace be upon him, says in some authentic narrations: «They bear witness but are not asked to bear witness». An allusion that they bear false witness, and their sign is obesity and indulgence in food and drink, and they have no concern but as He Almighty said: {and eat as the grazing livestock eat}",

"text": "[Muhammad: 12]. So the Muslims mentioned in the verse are the Muslim Companions, the Successors, and those who followed them. Why? Because they were close in era to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. So his Companions received the Quran fresh and tender as it was revealed without anything being changed or altered from it in terms of its concept. As for its wording, there is no alteration or change; because Allah Almighty says: {Indeed, it is We who sent down the Dhikr [Quran] and indeed, We will be its guardian} [Al-Hijr: 9]. Although there are, with deep regret, some Islamic sects who say: that the Quran present now in the hands of the Muslims is a part of the Mushaf of Fatimah, peace be upon her, as they claimed the Mushaf of Fatimah was lost, and this which remains with us is a quarter. They lied. Rather, the Quran is as He sent it down upon the heart of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and it is in the hands of the Muslims today. But with regret, at the time when Muslims pronounce it as it was revealed, they distort, change, and alter its meanings. Therefore, so that we may be upon clear evidence of the correctness of the meaning just as we are upon clear evidence of the correctness of the structure—meaning: the Divine Speech—what is the path to reach the knowledge of the correct meaning? It is returning to what the first Muslims were upon, the generations testified for with goodness, and they are referred to by a single term, which is: The Salaf (Predecessors) and the Salaf Salih (Pious Predecessors). This is what our Lord Almighty pointed to in the verse: {and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115]. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, clarified it in the Hadith of the Sects when he said: «Except one. They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: It is the Jama'ah».

"text": "What I and my companions are upon. He, peace be upon him, did not say: «What I am upon only». Rather, for the wisdom which I mentioned in the verse, he added to it: «and my companions». Why? Because we have no path to know what our Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, was upon except through the path of the Companions. And from here: the misguidance of some ancient sects appears to you, whose remnants still exist, and some modern sects that attack some of the Companions of the Messenger, peace be upon him. Whether those attacked are many or few, the important point: is that those who attack some of the Companions or many of them, they disable the indication of this noble Prophetic text which is: «What I and my companions are upon». Therefore, we find them not caring to know what the Companions were upon. Rather, they impose their understandings and intellects—if we do not say their desires—in interpreting the Quran, let alone the Hadiths of the Messenger, peace be upon him, with their desires and misguidance. I do not want to give you ancient examples except for one example, then I return to give modern examples from our reality today; because this reality is what relates to the groups existing today on the land of Islam. In ancient times, there existed among some sects deviating from the Book and the Sunnah those who interpreted the Quran by their desires, like the Rafidah (Shia rejectionists), for example, who interpret His saying, the Most High—even though the verse is related to what happened among the Children of Israel regarding their disobedience to their Prophet Moses, peace be upon him—our Lord Almighty said in the Quran: {Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow (Baqarah)} [Al-Baqarah: 67]. They said: A cow, meaning: Aisha. This can hardly be believed due to the remoteness of misguidance in this interpretation. The verse relates to the Children of Israel, and they turned it to the Mother of the Believers Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. So they said: Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow, meaning: Aisha. Why? Because they accuse her regarding",

"text": "her honor! And they believe the people of the slander (Ifk) who spread the fabrication of indecency about her, even though Allah Almighty purified her from that. This is an ancient example and it has many, very many models. And as I said earlier: I do not want to increase in these examples. Whoever among you wishes to expand, let him go to the book of Al-Kulayni, whose name is what? Al-Kulayni, a book considered [authoritative] by the Shia. The book «Al-Kafi» by Al-Kulayni; he will find there strange wonders of distorting words from their places. But what I want now is only some examples present now among the Islamic sects, or between some of them at least. You must have heard of a sect called the Qadianiyyah (Ahmadiyya). They attribute themselves to a town or village in Pakistan called Qadian. From here emerged a man from the Sufis, a scholar, but he was a Sufi with a Tariqa (Sufi path). So he claimed first: that he was the Mahdi, then he claimed that he was Jesus who is prophesied to descend at the end of time, then he claimed that revelation comes to him. And he has a book printed in Arabic called: The Reality of Revelation (Haqiqat al-Wahi). And he has strange blasphemies (Kufr) there from this prophet who lied and fabricated against Allah Almighty. He says there, for example, claiming that his name is Ahmad—and his name given by his father was Ghulam Ahmad. The translation of Ghulam Ahmad in their language means: Servant of Ahmad. And the intended 'Ahmad' here is: our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. And this newborn was named seeking blessings as Ghulam Ahmad, meaning: his servant. Then when he ascended in misguidance, he deleted the word Ghulam and his name remained: Ahmad. Then he claimed that Allah Almighty revealed to him that book known as 'The Reality of Revelation'. What does he say in it? Allah said to him: 'O Ahmad, you are to Me in the status of My Tawhid (Monotheism), you are to Me in the status of My Tafrid (Singularity)'. Meaning: [He claims] Tawhid is in the status of the Oneness of Allah Almighty. And he has many, very many of such misguidance. But when he claimed Prophethood, people followed him",

"text": "until today, and nearly seventy years have passed since him. He died having followers today spread in Britain, Germany, France, and they have strange activity in Da'wah—I do not say in the Call to Islam, but in the Call to their Islam; because part of their Islam is that Prophethood has not been cut off, contrary to the known verse: {but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and last of the prophets} [Al-Ahzab: 40]. Contrary to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: «Verily Prophethood and Messengership have been cut off, so there is no Prophet after me and no Messenger after me». And contrary to his saying, peace be upon him, to Ali when he, peace be upon him, went to Tabuk and left him in Medina as a deputy for him. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him: «You are to me in the position of Aaron to Moses, except that there is no Prophet after me». These Qadianis, do not think that they deny anything from the pillars of Faith (Iman), or anything from the pillars of Islam; no, they believe with us in all these pillars. They pray, fast, and perform Hajj, and their names are completely Islamic names. So do you consider them Muslims while they believe that this man is a truthful prophet? Then this man says: that prophets will come after him? Naturally: These are not Muslims; because they denied, as the jurists say: what is known from the religion by necessity. It is known from the religion by necessity among every Muslim that there is no Prophet after the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, due to the verse mentioned earlier, and the Hadiths some of which I also mentioned earlier. The Witness: Do they believe in this verse? The answer: Yes. Do they believe in these Hadiths? The answer: Yes. How is this, while they say contrary to the verse, and contrary to the Hadiths? Here comes the calamity of Ta'wil (allegorical interpretation/distortion). Here comes the calamity of Ta'wil which was the cause for dividing the Muslims into those ancient sects, and of which some effects still remain until today.

"text": "the Quran? The Answer: No. Then: Why did they deviate? Because they applied the pickaxe of Ta'wil to the texts of the Quran and Sunnah, so they went far astray. Likewise, these Qadianis did not exit from the Quran and Sunnah in wording, but they exited from the Quran and Sunnah in interpretation (Ta'wil) and distortion (Tahrif). So they said, for example, in the previous verse: {but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and last (Khatam) of the prophets} [Al-Ahzab: 40]. {But [he is] the Messenger of Allah} [Al-Ahzab: 40] meaning: He is the Messenger of Allah truly and truthfully. But 'Khatam an-Nabiyyin' (Seal of Prophets), the meaning of this description is that he is the ornament of the Prophets, and not the last of them. {But [he is] the Messenger of Allah and last (Khatam) of the prophets} [Al-Ahzab: 40]. They said: This is a simile, and this is a metaphor. Just as the ring (Khatam) on the finger is the ornament of the fingers and the hand, likewise Muhammad is the Seal (Khatam) of the Prophets, meaning: their ornament and not the last of them. Therefore: they believed and they disbelieved. Meaning: they believed in the wording of the Quran and disbelieved in its meaning. Do you think, when our Lord Almighty wants us to believe in the Quran, does He want us to believe in its wording without its meaning, or in its meaning without its wording, or does He want us to believe in both of them, wording and meaning? Undoubtedly the answer is: wording and meaning. There existed among Muslims philosophers who are considered among those who exited the religion of Allah in droves, and just as a hair is pulled from dough. They said: The verses that came commanding the establishment of prayer and giving Zakat, the intent of these verses is not this prayer that Muslims perform until today—and praise be to Allah—prayers at five times with known units (Rak'ahs), with conditions and pillars and so on. No, this is an error in understanding the verse. Rather the intent is: Establish prayer means: Supplication (Dua). And Zakat means: purification of the soul. So they nullified all these laws. And the meaning of this: is that they do not believe in Allah and His Messenger truly. This is what some Islamic philosophers say. But there is misguidance lower in degree than this misguidance, but it is misguidance nonetheless.

Meaning: he is not the last of them; because after the Messenger came Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadiani, and many prophets will come after him. And they interpreted the verse, they gave it Ta'wil, they disabled its indication like the Jews who distort words from their places. So they fell into Kufr (disbelief) while they rely on the Quran. And they rely on the Quran—so they claimed—interpreting the verse contrary to its correct interpretation. What did they do with the Hadith! You heard earlier his saying, peace be upon him, to Ali: «You are to me in the position of Aaron to Moses, except that there is no Prophet after me».

And the duty of the Muslim is to believe in the matters of the Unseen without expanding on them. Let us assume we were in the era of the Companions, were there seventy-three sects? No. Go down to the Successors, no. To their followers, no. Therefore: What would be the position of the Muslim on that day? Would he ask such a question, saying: Is this number for multitude or for threat? What do you think his position would be? \nIntervention: I think that since he sees that this matter is verified in the era of the Companions... the evidences that appear are contrary to that, that this matter happens at the [time of] strangeness of Islam? \nThe Sheikh: It is this, but this is not the answer to the question, may Allah bless you. On that day if he asks, would he ask: Is this for multitude, meaning: it does not imply limitation? Or is the origin in numbers limitation, and it does not imply multitude in the sense: that it is possible to be more than that, but it is not possible to be less than that unless it is proven practically and actually—and this is what I mean—no",

So, my purpose with this question, as I said at the beginning, has no benefit underneath it; it does not relate to a practical matter that we must know clearly to deal with; because this is a matter of the Unseen. But if a questioner were to ask, for example—I say for example to clarify the difference between that question and the following question: These sects, when the Messenger, peace be upon him, said: 'All of them are in the Fire except one,' does that include every sect regardless of whether its deviation is slight or major, and is its ruling the Fire in the sense of eternity, or is it subject to possibilities? This question is different from that question.

"text": "The Sheikh: This is it. Interjection: Yes. The Sheikh: So now I say: There are two things here: When does a sect become a deviant sect? It does not happen merely by deviating in a minor detail, as the answer was given previously just now. Rather, a sect becomes a deviant sect when a group gathers based on a methodology it establishes for itself, adopts, becomes partisan to, and is fanatical about. Then, this becomes a sect. As for an individual from among the Muslims making a mistake and falling into an innovation, whether it is a belief or a jurisprudential ruling, this is not considered a sect. Therefore, when we want to classify the sects and say: 'They have exceeded the number mentioned in the Hadith,' this requires, as they say today: a survey and study of these sects, and knowledge of their methodologies. If they truly have methodologies that distinguish one from the other, and every one of them contradicts the Book and the Sunnah and what the Righteous Predecessors (Salaf) were upon, then we can say: This is a deviant sect, and this is a deviant sect, and this is a deviant sect. So if we enumerate these sects and define their methodologies and judge them as being contrary to the methodology that the Messenger, peace be upon him, and his noble Companions were upon, then we will say: Every sect from these is among the deviant sects. If they exceed seventy-three sects, then we say what the people of knowledge said: The number has no concept (restriction), but the number has no concept in terms of the maximum, not in terms of the minimum, is that clear? Interjection: Yes. The Sheikh: Ah, but I tell you quite frankly: It is not possible for a human to count the sects existing today and to conduct a study on every sect, and judge by the scale of the Just Law that this is a deviant sect and this is a deviant sect, then say: Their number exceeded seventy-three sects. This is not possible. Rather, it is an impulse that may be accompanied by some desire, or may be accompanied by some...",

Meaning, there must be advice; the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, advised his Companions. So if you would honor us with advice to guide us in the time we live in, of tribulations (fitan), trials, slips, and the like, and may Allah bless you. The Sheikh: In any case, if you recall a Hadith, remind us of it, and may Allah reward you with good. Otherwise, what I mentioned just now from the Verse and the Hadith of Abu Bakr is sufficient, Allah willing, as an answer to what you asked, with another addition, which is what we always and forever dwell upon: That the Muslim continues in seeking beneficial knowledge coupled with righteous deeds, and that he remembers the wisdom that was reported in some Hadiths—even if they are weak Hadiths in terms of their chain of narration, yet in terms of their meaning, they contain profound wisdom—among them is: 'Blessed is he whose own fault occupies him from the faults of people.' Because I see, truly, that many of our brothers, students of knowledge, concern themselves with others more than they concern themselves with their own selves. Therefore, I mention this wisdom, and I do not say this Hadith: 'Blessed is he whose own fault occupies him from the faults of people.' And I do not mean, naturally, that his preoccupation with his own fault and his holding himself to account should also occupy him from directing his advice to his brothers, no. But I do not want the Muslim student of knowledge to reverse the matter, becoming occupied with guiding people and instructing them, then forgetting himself { ... Upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided ... } [Al-Ma'idah: 105]. With that, I return the ball to you; perhaps there is a Hadith in your mind about this, so remind us of it, and may Allah reward you with good.",

The Sheikh: ... commandments are many, and praise be to Allah. A Hadith I remembered in the context of the speech, and perhaps we spoke with you about it on the phone once, and it is a strange Hadith that we do not hear repeated in the gatherings of our Salafi brothers, meaning despite its greatness in methodology, and praise be to Allah. A Hadith in 'Mushkil al-Athar' by al-Tahawi and in 'Al-Mu'jam Al-Awsat' by al-Tabarani from Mu'adh, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said: 'Indeed, there will be tribulations (fitan).' He said: We said, 'And what is the exit from them, O Messenger of Allah?' So he repeated the same phrase, 'Indeed, there will be tribulations.' He said: We said, 'And what is the exit from them, O Messenger of Allah?' So he repeated it a third time. Then Mu'adh repeated the same question. Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, was reclining, so he sat up and said: 'You return to your first command (affair).' 'You return to your first command.' And this confirms the rule that our teacher always repeats, which is Purification and Education (At-Tasoiyah wat-Tarbiyah). It is impossible for the Ummah to exit the tribulations except by returning to its first command, and it is impossible in these days to return to its first command without passing through Purification and Education. The Sheikh: There is no doubt nor uncertainty, and praise be to Allah for this advice. And of that is the saying of one of the Salaf, Abdullah ibn Masoud, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: 'Follow and do not innovate, for you have been sufficed; stick to the first command.' This is derived from the Hadith of the Messenger, peace be upon him: 'Stick to the first command.' Interjection: Our Sheikh, I also remembered something related to this, Allah the Majestic and Exalted says: {And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And We have instructed those who were given the Scripture before you and yourselves to fear Allah.} [An-Nisa: 131]. May Allah reward you with good, O Sheikh. The Sheikh: Yes, 'Fear Allah' (Taqwa) is the foundation for success. But this also should be linked to beneficial knowledge, because much of what is claimed to be piety of Allah is not from it in any way. So knowledge...",

Some of them say: The call to Tawheed (Monotheism) is the original foundation of this religion, and to it refers the creed of the Salaf, or the creed of the Salaf returns to it. And some of them say to you: Education, Purification, and the unity of the Ummah is what the Ummah needs now in this time. And some say: Lifting the youth from the abyss to elevation is the goal of the Ummah and the goal of Islam. So we hope for a middle word in this field, and encouragement and direction to the correct, sound methodology. The Sheikh: In my belief, the previous speech can be considered an answer to this question, but some clarification is necessary: In the question, it is stated that some Muslims today are concerned, or see the concern with the call to Tawheed, and people with Purification and Education, and people with gathering the word (unity), and the like. So I say: Starting with the call to Tawheed is the Sunnah of the Prophets and Messengers from before. For the verses are abundant that Allah Almighty did not send a Prophet except that he called his people to the worship of Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, alone with no partner. And the story of Noah, peace be upon him, in the Surah that was named after him is not far from you. However, starting with Tawheed does not mean turning away from the Call (Da'wah). Islam as a whole is indivisible. Therefore, the caller must be—and I said in the recent past and in a blessed gathering like this gathering of yours or larger: The call to Allah Almighty, the callers should be upon a plentiful share of knowledge.

So how can he be able to be a caller, when he is the one who should be given a plentiful share of knowledge? So the Call must be firstly from the scholars, then it must be complete and comprehensive of this Islam about which Allah said in the Quran: {Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam} [Al Imran: 19]. So if some people are concerned with the call to Tawheed, and this is their duty, that does not mean that they do not call to every aspect of the aspects of Islam. But this means that the caller must be upon knowledge of all... or at least of most of the chapters of Sharia. And those arising today who belong to what are called 'Callers' (Du'at), then differ in the path that should be taken in the Call, and as you heard in the question—although this question is not very clear; because there is not much difference between one plan and another—but what must be is that all the calls that we hear the voice of in all Islamic lands must be upon a common word, which is: That we call to Allah based on the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and upon the methodology of the Righteous Predecessors, while urging people to be keen on action more than... on speech.

So we do not call to forming blocs, nor to partisanship, nor to gathering [in a partisan way]. Rather, we call all Muslims to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and upon the methodology of the Righteous Predecessors... upon the methodology of the Righteous Predecessors. This is our call to all Muslims in all lands of the world. And the difference between our call and the call of others—whether his call was originally Salafi then he became partisan and formed a bloc, or the other blocs or other groups—is that the Salafi Call gathers all Muslims and accommodates all of them, unlike any other group or party; for their party does not accommodate all the other parties and blocs.

The Sheikh: The Hadith came as an answer to this question in the books of Hadith such as Sunan At-Tirmidhi and others, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, that he said: 'The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians split into seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them are in the Fire except one.' They said: 'Who is it, O Messenger of Allah?' He said - in a narration -: 'The Jama'ah (The Group/Community).' Meaning: The group of the Messenger, peace be upon him, i.e., the Companions. And the evidence for this is the other narration: 'He said: It is that which is upon what I and my Companions are upon.' So the Saved Sect is the one that adheres to the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and the Sunnah of his Companions, especially the Sunnah of the Righteous Caliphs, which he, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded in the Hadith of Irbad ibn Sariyah, where this noble Companion, who is from the People of the Suffah, said: 'The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, admonished us with an admonition that caused hearts to tremble and eyes to shed tears. So we said: Advise us, O Messenger of Allah. He said: I advise you to fear Allah, and to listen and obey even if an Abyssinian slave is appointed over you. And indeed, whoever among you lives long will see much difference. So upon you is my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Righteous Guided Caliphs after me; bite onto it with your molars.

"text": "- peace and blessings be upon him and his family. Why did he mention his Companions in the previous Hadith with his Sunnah, and in the subsequent Hadith the Righteous Caliphs from among his Companions? That is because they received the Sharia clarified from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, by his word and his deed. For we did not hear his words nor did we see his deeds, rather we learned that through the path of his Companions. And his Companions are the ones who applied the Law of Allah, which they understood from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, with a correct application. Therefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim to suffice with returning to the Book and the Sunnah only, but rather he adds to that what the Messenger, peace be upon him, added in the Hadith of the Sects and in the Hadith of the Righteous Caliphs. And that is what the Lord of the Worlds pointed to in the Holy Quran when He, the Mighty and Majestic, said: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115] He said: {and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115]. Allah the Mighty and Majestic did not say: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him - We will give him what he has taken}, rather He conjoined to the opposition of the Messenger, saying: {and follows other than the way of the believers}. Did our Lord mention this in vain? Far be it from Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He. For there is not a word in the Quran except for profound wisdom, let alone a sentence like this sentence: {and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115]. The wisdom in that is what I mentioned just now. Therefore, Imam Shafi'i argued that it is not permissible to contradict the way of the believers, and this contradiction only happens by some people being stubborn and interpreting some texts from the Book and the Sunnah without seeking help in understanding those texts from what our Righteous Predecessors were upon. Therefore, we know with certainty that the reason for the division of Muslims into seventy-three sects, one of which is the Saved Sect, is that; because it adhered to the Book and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of the Righteous Predecessors. As for the one who adhered to the Book and the Sunnah according to his own interpretation, and turned away from what the Righteous Predecessors were upon, he has contradicted the Verse: {and follows other than the way of the...",

We do not need now to remind you of some of the old Islamic sects such as the Mu'tazila, the Kharijites, the Murji'ah, and others, for the opposition of these to the Book and the Sunnah is known. And that is only because a part of them do not return to the Sunnah, so they reject authentic Hadiths, and a part of them interpret the Hadiths with other than what our Righteous Predecessors understood. We will not go far to strike for you some examples from the beliefs of these apparent old sects, but we strike for you an example with the deviation of some Muslims today, a very dangerous deviation that is Disbelief (Kufr) itself and Apostasy (Riddah) itself. Namely, a sect known as the Qadianis, and they call themselves Ahmadis. Those who know their history and their activity in calling to their Islam would be amazed at how they empty themselves with this activity in calling to their religion while they claim their religion is Islam. There is no doubt nor uncertainty that they testify that there is no deity but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and they pray, fast, perform Hajj, and pay Zakat, meaning: they perform the five Islamic pillars. But despite that, they are not Muslims. Why? Because they came to some Quranic verses and interpreted them according to their whims and did not interpret them according to the way of the Muslims. So they followed other than the path of the believers, so the saying of the Lord of the Worlds applied to them: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115]. These believe that Allah the Mighty and Majestic did not seal Prophethood with Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, but rather prophets will come after him. And indeed, they claimed that Allah sent a prophet to them from India from a village called Qadian, and the name of that alleged prophet is Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadiani. So they believe that this is a prophet after our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. So did they disbelieve in the Quran?

They did not disbelieve in this wording, but they used a trick against it and nullified its indication. They did not disbelieve in his saying, peace and blessings be upon him and his family: 'There is no prophet after me,' but they also interpreted it with other than what the Muslims received. Regarding the previous Verse, His saying Almighty: {but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the prophets} [Al-Ahzab: 40], they said: The meaning of Seal of the prophets is: i.e., the Ornament of the prophets, like the ring (khatam) on the finger; it does not mean that no prophet comes after him. And when they addressed the authentic Hadiths: 'There is no prophet after me,' they said: The meaning of no prophet after me is: no prophet with me, and there was no prophet with him, but 'after him' means: after his death, a prophet comes, and one has indeed come. Thus: From such a modern example, it becomes clear to you that it is not sufficient for the Muslim to understand the Quran and the Hadith of the Messenger, peace be upon him, separately from the understanding of our Righteous Predecessors of the Quran and the Sunnah. From here, the profound wisdom appears in mentioning the Verse 'the way of the believers', and the Messenger mentioning the Companions and the Righteous Caliphs, so that the Muslim does not deviate in understanding some texts from the Book and the Sunnah and go far astray. And the safeguard in that is following the Salaf as he, peace and blessings be upon him, said in the Hadith of the Sects: 'What I and my Companions are upon.' He did not say: 'What I am upon' only, because the Companions are the ones who transmitted to us what the Messenger, peace be upon him, was upon and clarified it with a clarification that left no one after that to come and philosophize and interpret some texts according to their whims. These Qadianis, part of their deviation from Islam is that they denied a creation [while] Allah Almighty sent down a Surah in the name of the Jinn. So they denied the existence of this creation despite the Quran explicitly stating that in more than one verse, and the Surah mentioned just now is sufficient. Did they deny the Surah? Did they deny His saying Almighty: {Say, \"It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an.'\"} [Al-Jinn: 1]? Did they deny the word 'Jinn' mentioned in this Surah and in other verses?

They denied the Jinn (Jannah) and said: The Jinn here: are the humans, and 'Al-Nas' (mankind): is a clarification of the word Jinn, and they are the humans. This is the suspension (Ta'til) which our scholars from the Salaf used to direct disapproval against the old sects who used to interpret the verses like the interpretation of this modern sect. Therefore, they were named 'Al-Mu'attilah' (The Suspenders/Negators); because they suspend (nullify the meaning of) the legal texts. So: The safeguard from a Muslim being—especially at the end of time—a sect from the seventy-two sects, and the argument to be... is what was previously explained regarding the Book and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of the Righteous Predecessors. Therefore, Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, may Allah have mercy on him, says: 'Knowledge is: Allah said, His Messenger said, The Companions said... He did not say only: Knowledge is: Allah said, His Messenger said, but he said in the third: The Companions said. From where did he take this? From the previous evidences: Knowledge is: Allah said, His Messenger said... The Companions said; it is not by camouflage. Knowledge is not your setting up disagreement foolishly... Between the Messenger and the opinion of a jurist. No, nor the denial of Attributes and negating them... cautious of suspension (Ta'til) and anthropomorphism (Tashbih).' So if you remember these texts from the Book and the Sunnah, you will be keen with us, with all keenness, not to be independent in understanding the Book and the Sunnah, and not to isolate ourselves in that and contradict what the Righteous Predecessors were upon. Therefore, it became famous from the scholars that they used to say: 'And all good is in following those who preceded... And all evil is in the innovation of those who succeeded.'

We hope from you that you clarify to us what is the correct methodology in the Salafi Call, especially in this time when tribulations (fitan) have increased and knowledge has decreased, and what is the difference between organization...? We hope for clarification and may Allah reward you with good. The Sheikh: As for the Call (Da'wah), it is not upheld except by people of knowledge who stand for justice. As for what has spread in this time that many people who have not been given except a share of knowledge that is hardly worth mentioning name themselves 'Callers to Allah' (Du'at), this is, in my belief—and perhaps you will be surprised, but I bear the responsibility of what I say—from the innovations of the present era. From the innovations of the present era is that it is now rumored among people that there are thousands of Callers, yet they are not upon knowledge, neither of the Book nor of the Sunnah nor of the traditions of the Salaf, nor even of the established traditional schools of thought (Madhhabs) today. Rather, they know some simple rulings and perhaps some verses and some Hadiths that the least knowledgeable of people can deliver, then they set themselves up as Callers. So if they are asked about a certain issue, they become confused and cannot answer, or they may answer with extreme ignorance, and this is from the bane of the present era. And the matter does not stop at these emerging youth, but we may find great men who were not given that plentiful share of knowledge, yet they became famous as Callers. To what? To Islam, while they fight Islam by fighting the Sunnah, without which a Muslim cannot understand the Book of Allah except through the path of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. So how can one be a Caller to Islam who is ignorant of the Sunnah as a science, and then who fights it in some of its aspects, at least in belief? This one is not fit to...",

Likewise, there exist today some Callers who were not given a plentiful share and much knowledge of the Sunnah, in the light of which the Holy Quran can be interpreted correctly. So what does a person say about the likes of these? Nay, what do we say about the modern upstarts where one of them hardly graduates from secondary school, let alone taking a higher degree than... even a PhD degree, and even in Sharia, yet they have not yet learned many of the rulings of Sharia. What do we say about these when they have set themselves up to call to Islam, they claimed, while the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said as in Sahih Al-Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadith of Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Al-Aas, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said: 'Indeed, Allah does not take away knowledge by snatching it from the chests of the scholars, but He takes away knowledge by taking away the scholars (by their death), until when no scholar remains, people take ignorant heads; so they are asked and they give fatwas without knowledge, so they go astray and lead others astray.' I know some Muftis in some Arab Islamic lands, not non-Arab lands, who were asked about foreign maids who are brought to some Islamic lands as servants: Is it permissible for these disbelieving servant women for the lady of the Muslim house to uncover herself in front of her, or must she veil herself in front of her just as she veils herself from foreign men, as is the explicit text of the Quran due to His saying, Blessed and Exalted is He: {and not display their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers} [An-Nur: 31] until He said Almighty in the end of the Verse:...",

As for other than that, such as living bare-headed, revealing her chest... revealing her upper arm; because she takes her freedom in the privacy of her home, but she has a disbeliever... a disbelieving maid. Do you know what he answered? He answered that it is permissible by analogy (Qiyas) to the female slaves (Al-Ima') i.e., the bondwomen who used to be taken by a legal means, so she would be her mistress. And we know from the Sunnah that the slave of a woman, who is male, it is permissible for her and permissible for him to see from her what is permissible for her Mahram to see from her. For it came in Sunan Abi Dawud that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, entered one day upon Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and with him was a slave of hers and she was... So when she saw the Messenger, peace be upon him, and her slave with him, she tried to cover herself and wrap herself with her cover, so he, peace and blessings be upon him, said to her: 'There is no harm on you; it is only your father and your slave' (1). So by greater reason and propriety, if it was a woman. So he analogized this disbelieving maid who is not an owned slave to the owned slave. Does not the saying of him, peace be upon him, mentioned just now apply to such a case: 'People take ignorant heads; so they are asked and they give fatwas without knowledge, so they go astray and lead others astray'? This one has a high position, so what do we say about the modern generation who set themselves up for the Call, they claimed, to Islam, while they do not know from Islam except a little thing?

The important thing: Calling to Allah must be, first of all, upon knowledge: {And who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteousness and says, \"Indeed, I am of the Muslims.\"} [Fussilat: 33]. If he is not a worker [of good] and knowledgeable, he will not be a worker of righteousness. And one who lacks a thing, as it was said of old, cannot give it. So he who should be a Caller must be a scholar. Then this is not enough; he must be knowledgeable of the Book and the Sunnah, not of some late jurisprudential opinions, falling into the likes of that analogy you heard just now, analogizing the free disbelieving maid to the disbelieving slave, and what a difference there is between them. This is firstly: That he be a scholar. Secondly: That he be knowledgeable of the Book and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of the Righteous Predecessors. And finally: That he be acting upon his knowledge. For the call to Allah Almighty, even if it is one hundred percent correct, if it is not coupled with the action of this Caller, it will not have the desired effect on the masses of people; because people care about following the example of people of knowledge and virtue in their actions more than their words. This is what relates to the path of calling to Allah. As for what is called today 'Organization' (Tanzeem), organization has two forms: There is no doubt that any work intended to be benefited from must have organization, such as lessons that may be given, for example, in some schools or in some universities; this is organization. Because if that is not done, the matter of education becomes chaos. There is no objection to this organization in the way existing today in the modern era, just as something like that existed in the past where study circles existed in all mosques that were in the lands. And I personally caught up with the largest mosque in Syria, which is known as the Umayyad Mosque, the Mosque of Banu Umayya; I caught up in it multiple circles morning and evening. This one teaches Tafsir, and that one teaches Hanafi Fiqh, and that one Shafi'i Fiqh, even though there was only one lesson a week in Prophetic Hadith, and so on. As for today, the mosques have become empty wastelands... (Rihlat al-Noor 37 A/00: 00: 45)",

So what is your opinion on that? The Sheikh: My opinion is the previous opinion: That there is no benefit in that unless they return to the correct methodology which we always dwell upon and call to. For he who lacks a thing cannot give it, as we said. So the Awakening will remain walking... very slowly until Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, destines for it someone who takes its hand and guides it to the path that the entire Ummah must tread in fulfillment of His saying, Blessed and Exalted is He: {If you support Allah, He will support you} [Muhammad: 7]. And there is no doubt that the Muslims' support of Allah is only for His religion and acting upon His rulings. And that is not possible except by two things that we have long called all Muslims to apply, which is what I call: Purification and Education (At-Tasoiyah wat-Tarbiyah). So if there is no purified knowledge taken from the Book and the Sunnah, it will not benefit except a little. Then this knowledge, if it benefits, it only benefits if it is coupled with action. Otherwise, the knowledge will be a calamity upon its owner, as is known from the evidences of the Sharia, such as His saying Almighty: {O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do? * Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do} [As-Saff: 2-3]. So the rising of some people from those who belong to knowledge while they are not upon correct knowledge, this does not benefit anything. And we struck an example in the meeting that was held yesterday of that scholar who was chosen for a high position, just as he gave a fatwa that foreign maids are in the status of captives (Sabaya) for whom it is permissible to see women in their clothing in their homes, even though free disbelieving women...",

Perhaps we will limit ourselves to reminding of one Hadith among them, which is the Hadith of Irbad bin Sariyah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, gave us a sermon by which our hearts were filled with fear and eyes flowed with tears. We said: O Messenger of Allah, advise us. He said: «I advise you to fear Allah, and to listen and obey, even if an Abyssinian slave is appointed over you. For whoever among you lives [after me] will see great difference. So, adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs after me. Bite onto it with your molar teeth. And beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a Bid'ah (innovation), and every Bid'ah is misguidance». In this Hadith, as you heard, there is a command for something in addition to the Book and the Sunnah, and that is following the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs after the Noble Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. This is only because the Rightly Guided Caliphs received knowledge, the Book, and the Sunnah directly from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, without any intermediary, and they understood this Sunnah and the Holy Quran as the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, taught them. Therefore, every seeker of knowledge should not forget this noble Prophetic command to follow the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and attached to them are those who were people of knowledge from the other Companions. Since the matter is such, our call and our knowledge must be derived from the Book, the Sunnah, and the practice of the righteous Salaf (predecessors). For this reason, Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyya, may Allah have mercy on him, says: Knowledge is: 'Allah said', 'His Messenger said' ... 'The Companions said', it is not camouflage/distortion. Knowledge is not that you set up a disagreement foolishly ... between the Messenger and the opinion of a jurist. No, nor is it the denial of Attributes and negating them ... out of caution against Ta'teel (negation) and Tashbih (anthropomorphism). This is what relates to beneficial knowledge, which must be the goal of every student of knowledge, and his goal should not be seeking traditional knowledge based on sectarian fanaticism; this one is a Hanafi,",

Therefore, we follow their path upon which they set out and walked, which is nothing but similar to the righteous Salaf as we mentioned earlier. However, we are not fanatically biased towards one of them over the other. This is beneficial knowledge, meaning: that which is derived from the Book, the Sunnah, and the practice of the righteous Salaf. As for action, the Muslim must be sincere in it to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, seeking neither reward nor gratitude behind it... seeking neither payment nor vanity nor a position nor anything similar. rather, he performs the righteous deed for Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, just as He, the Mighty and Majestic, said in the Holy Quran: {Say, \"I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God. So whoever would hope for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone.\"} [Al-Kahf: 110]. The scholars of Tafsir (exegesis) and Fiqh said regarding this last sentence of the noble verse: {let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone}; they said: The deed is not righteous unless it is in accordance with the Sunnah, and it is not accepted by Allah, even if it is in accordance with the Sunnah, unless it is purely for the Face of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted. The verses and Hadiths regarding this meaning are many, very many. Suffice us, before these questions, is this brief word. It summarizes that every Muslim must perfect the pursuit of knowledge in the light of the Book, the Sunnah, and the practice of the righteous Salaf, and that he should not seek from his righteous deeds anything except the Face of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted. This is what Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has facilitated regarding this request. (Silsilat al-Huda wa an-Nur (188) / 00:00:03)",

I attribute the reason for this to: the haste of many Muslim youth to claim knowledge. So, he dares to issue Fatwas, and to declare things prohibited (Haram) and lawful (Halal) before he knows—some of them, as we have heard often, do not know how to read a verse from the Quran properly even if the Noble Mushaf is in front of him, let alone that he often makes grammatical errors in reading the Hadith of the Messenger, upon him be peace and blessings. The well-known proverb in some countries applies to him: \"He became a raisin before becoming a sour grape.\" You know 'Hisrim' (sour/unripe grape)? Is this word used by you? The grape, when it begins, becomes a green berry, and this is 'Hisrim', and the 'Hisrim' is very sour. So, before he became a 'Hisrim', he made himself like a raisin, meaning: like the grape that ripened and became a raisin. Therefore, the obstinacy of many of these people and their haste in claiming knowledge and writing, while they have barely walked halfway down the path of knowledge, is what has made those who ascribe themselves to the Salafi Call, unfortunately, into sects and parties. Therefore, the remedy—there is no remedy for it except that these Muslims fear their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, and that they know that not everyone who begins seeking knowledge can put himself forward for Fatwa in prohibiting and permitting, and in authenticating and weakening Hadith, except after a long life spent practicing",

In this regard, it is necessary for these preachers or Salafis to abide by the third constraint that I previously mentioned during the talk about beneficial knowledge and righteous action. We have said that beneficial knowledge must be upon the methodology of the righteous Salaf. So when many of the Islamic preachers today deviate from abiding by this third constraint which Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, pointed to in his previous poetry, when he said:\n'Knowledge is: Allah said, His Messenger said ... The Companions said, it is not camouflage.'\nNot turning to what our righteous predecessors were upon returns people, after they had agreed, to the division that distances them from each other just as it distanced many Muslims before, making them sects and parties, each party rejoicing in what it has. This is my opinion on this reality. So, if they are sincere, as we hope, they must hold fast to the correct scientific principles, and he who has not reached the rank of correct knowledge should not dare [to speak]; he should hide from that and entrust knowledge to its scholar.

The reason for that is: they feared falling into error and thus leading others into error. So, one of them would wish not to bear this responsibility and that someone else would bear it. As for now, the phenomenon is completely the opposite, with deep regret. This goes back to a clear reason that I mention always and forever: it is that the openness we feel now towards the Book and the Sunnah and the Salafi Call is a recent matter. Not a long time has passed since this openness, which they call \"The Awakening\" (As-Sahwah), not a long time has passed for these people to harvest the fruit of this awakening or this openness within themselves. Meaning: that they be educated/cultivated on the basis of the Book and the Sunnah, and then consequently overflow with this correct education based on the Book and the Sunnah onto others around them, the nearest then the nearest. The reason is that the effect of this Call has not appeared; because it is new to this era in which we live. Therefore, we find the phenomenon opposite to what we mentioned earlier from what Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Layla narrated about those Companions who used to be pious about being asked, and wished that others would be asked. They only answered the question because of their knowledge that it is not permissible for them to conceal knowledge, but in the depths of their hearts, they wished that others would handle it. As for now, you find in many Salafi societies, let alone others, someone is asked who is thought to be more knowledgeable than those present, and suddenly you find so-and-so starts talking while he is not the one asked, and another starts talking while not asked.

We grew up on Salafi knowledge, each according to his effort and striving for this knowledge, but as for upbringing/cultivation, we have not acquired it yet as a Salafi Islamic society. Therefore, these groups, blocs, and parties—in every party, we find such division; its cause is nothing but the lack of correct Islamic upbringing. For about twenty years I have been saying: The remedy for this Ummah, for its glory to return to it and for its state to be realized for it, there is no way to that except by starting with what I summarize in two words: Tasfiyah (Purification) and Tarbiyah (Education/Cultivation). Unlike many groups that strive to establish the Muslim State, according to their claim, by laying their hands on power/rule, whether that is by a peaceful path as they say through elections, or that is by a bloody path like military coups and bloody revolutions and the like. We say: This is not the path to establish the State of Islam on the land of Islam. Rather, the path is the path of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, who called in Mecca, as you know, for thirteen years, then completed the call in Medina. There he began, after he had purified for himself from those who followed him and believed in him men whom the blame of a blamer would not overtake in [the cause of] Allah, he began laying the foundations of the Muslim State. And history, as they say, repeats itself. So there is absolutely no way—and I am certain of what I say, and the realistic experience for nearly a century indicates that there is absolutely no room for realizing a correct Islamic renaissance, and behind it establishing the Muslim State, except by achieving these two goals: Which is Tasfiyah (Purification), which is a metonym for correct knowledge.

"text":"Reconciling the two Hadiths: \"The likeness of my Ummah...\" and \"The best of people...\"\n\nIntervention: How do we reconcile between these two Hadiths: The first Hadith: The saying of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him: «My Ummah is like the rain, it is not known whether its beginning is better or its end», and his saying: «The best of people is my generation»?\n\nThe Sheikh: The first Hadith does not contradict the other Hadith: «The best of people is my generation» to the end of it. For this Hadith favors the first generation over the second, and the second over the third. However, the second Hadith, which is his saying, peace be upon him: «My Ummah is like the rain, it is not known whether the good is in its beginning or in its end», contains nothing but that goodness may be in the end of the Ummah like the rain; it may not be known if the good is in its beginning or its end. As for regarding the Salaf (predecessors), goodness was known in them, rather it was known regarding them that it is the best goodness found on the face of the earth according to the order mentioned in \"The best of people.\" As for the other Hadith: «My Ummah is like the rain, it is not known whether the good is in its beginning or in its end», it is only a glad tiding from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, that there may be goodness in the end of the Ummah, and it does not negate that there is goodness in the beginning of the Ummah, for the Mutawatir (consecutively recurrent) Hadith which I pointed to earlier has proven that. He only wants to inject spirit [of hope] into the Ummah, and to cut off despair of mercy from them, so he says: That goodness may be in the end of this Ummah just as it was in its beginning. And the Hadiths that explicitly state something like his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: «A group of my Ummah will not cease to be dominant upon the truth; those who oppose them will not harm them until the command of Allah comes» or in a narration: \"until the Hour is established\", this is proof that goodness is continuous in the Ummah and is not cut off, but it is not like the goodness that was in the beginning of the Ummah",

Therefore, these movements, if we do not say revolutions, did not benefit the Islamic world in anything; rather, they harmed it with great, severe harm, setting the Call back, Masha'Allah, by many years. Therefore, we advise always and forever that Muslims must be concerned before anything else with rectifying themselves according to the limit of His saying, Blessed and Exalted: {O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided} [Al-Ma'idah: 105].

Intuitively, no one who has been given anything of understanding and jurisprudence in the language, let alone the Book and Sunnah, would have it cross his mind that the address in His saying {And prepare} is directed to the disbelievers. No one understands this. But I know this and I say what is like the sun in the clear day intuitively as a prelude to the other understanding as well, which may not cross anyone's mind, even if it is slightly more hidden than the first. So I say: His saying, the Exalted: {And prepare}, just as it is not an address to the disbelievers, it is not an address to the hypocrites who display Islam and conceal disbelief in Allah and His Messenger. This is the second matter. And the third: which is more hidden than the previous two matters: It is not intended by this command the corrupt (Fussaq) among the Muslims. {And prepare} - it is not intended by this command the corrupt of the Muslims and their sinners. Rather, what is intended by this command are the true believers. And I do not doubt that such believers have an existence in every time and in every place, even if in varying proportions of many and few. That is indicated by his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: «A group of my Ummah will not cease to be dominant upon the truth; those who oppose them will not harm them until the Hour is established». So, the first thing that comes to mind is that intended by this command directed in the previous verse {And prepare} are the believers. And I do not say: \"So pay attention, they are these believers\"—meaning: I will say finally—rather, the intended are these believers [only] if they are united/agglomerated and not divided. At the very least, they should not be divided in their bodies and in their lands.

Yes. So I say: These people may be enthusiastic with the utmost enthusiasm, but their hearts have not yet been filled with this faith which pushes firstly to being one hand as I mentioned earlier, then after that, it might be possible—and I say while meaning what I say—it might be possible that they realize this Quranic command {And prepare against them whatever you are able of power}.

This is the duty of the people of knowledge. If one is capable of understanding the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, then this is his duty, and it is not permissible for him to study Islam through any other path due to the multitude of verses that have come commanding us to return to the Book and the Sunnah, and some of them have been mentioned previously. As for the one who is not able, Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. We mentioned previously the verse: {So ask the people of the message if you do not know} [An-Nahl: 43], and the people of the message are the people of the Qur'an in understanding, action, and application. So whoever is able to understand but then does not act, there is no doubt he is sinful. Otherwise, what is the purpose of sending down the Book upon the heart of the Messenger, peace be upon him, and Allah's command to him in the Qur'an to explain to the people what was sent down to them? Is it not to act upon it?! There is no doubt and no uncertainty. And there is no doubt and no uncertainty either that the way to act upon the Book and the Sunnah is knowledge, for knowledge usually precedes action. For example, if any person wants to perform an act of worship—you want to pray, and you know that you must perform ablution (Wudu)—if you do not learn Wudu, you will not pray, and if you pray [without learning], you will not perfect the prayer. So it is a very self-evident matter that knowledge of obedience and worship precedes the worship.

The second type of knowledge is Communal Knowledge (Fard Kifaya), which is that there be among the Muslims people who gain understanding of the Book of Allah in all rulings of the Sharia, so that if a questioner asks about a rare issue, for example, there will be an answer available because he has gained understanding of the Book of Allah and the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. From here, the danger of turning away from studying the Book and the Sunnah becomes clear, because issues arise in every time and every place, and a person cannot give an answer if he is restricted to one of the schools of thought (Madhabs) and is not learned in the Book of Allah and the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. I do not know, so as not to go too far, perhaps I have hovered in the answer around your question. Your question was: Are they sinful? Undoubtedly, those who are able to study the Book and the Sunnah and then turn away from it or them are sinful. As for the incapable, Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity.\nInterjection: The one who does not apply [it]?\nThe Sheikh: Pardon, what I understand from you is: are you asking now about application or about knowledge?\nInterjection: Knowledge, then application comes [next].",

    "text": "The Sheikh: So: Now we have left the scientific aspect. Now you are asking: a person among people who cannot apply [the religion]. The answer is easy, but often the question is unrealistic. It is said: He cannot pray, for example. If we accept this for the sake of argument, we say: Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity; he does not pray. But is it true that he cannot pray?! It is not true, but in his imagination, he [thinks he] cannot pray. I know many sick people who are consistent with prayers during their health, but when they are confined to their beds, they stop praying. What is wrong with you, so-and-so? \"By Allah, I cannot perform ablution, my clothes are dirty... etc.\" Well, pray within the limits of your ability; Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. Therefore: the statement of this human that he cannot pray is incorrect. So now, if you really want to pinpoint this aspect, you must give an example. What is the legal ruling that you imagine the one charged with it cannot perform? Whatever this ruling is, if the claim is true—meaning, you say: \"He cannot\"—then we say: The obligation falls from him, because he cannot. But I fear what I fear is that an example is circulating in your mind similar to the example I gave just now, that Zayd among people does not pray claiming he cannot pray. No, I say HE cannot pray due to his ignorance. Here it goes back to... the necessity of knowledge. Otherwise, he is able to pray, as came in the authentic Hadith in Sahih Al-Bukhari from the Hadith of Imran bin Husain who said: I had hemorrhoids, so I came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and he said: «Pray standing; if you are not able, then sitting; if you are not able, then on your side.» So: He was able to pray, but [only] after he knew the method of prayer for the one who cannot pray standing. So, can we now understand from you an example regarding your question?\nInterjection: For example, an employee in a company, [and there are dealings with banks and usury...].",

    "text": "The Sheikh: Did you see how the example clarifies issues? This example is like my previous example. You now say \"forced.\" Is he forced to work in this company? You will say intuitively: No. Is he forced to work in all companies? He will say this, and you said before: No, he is not forced. Therefore: The question is built upon one who is not forced. We have a proverb in the Levant (Sham): \"He who does not want to see a horrific sight of death should not sleep among the graves,\" for if he sleeps among the graves, he will see a horrific sight of death. So if he enters a company that does not adhere to the rulings of the Sharia, he will expose himself to things in which he disobeys the Sharia. But is he forced? He is not forced to work.\nInterjection: ...\nThe Sheikh: This is a second discussion, but are you convinced by my statement that Zayd among people is not forced to work in such-and-such company? I will strike an example for you related to it, and I was asked quite recently, related to prayer: People, during the days of the week, he allows them—may he be thanked—to pray Dhuhr, for example, where they work, but he does not allow them to go to the mosque. You, no offense, might think this is an example that he cannot pray Friday prayer. But I look at the issue fundamentally: Is it obligatory upon him to work in this company that does not allow him to respond to the command of Allah when he hears the saying of the Mu'adhin on Friday: \"Come to prayer, Come to success\"? Is he unable to work except in this company, and consequently cannot pray the Friday prayer? The answer: No. What is built upon corruption is corrupt. His work in this company—especially if he knew beforehand that the employees there are not free in their worship, then it became clear to him after a month or two, taking a salary for a month or two, etc., that he is forced to obey this disbeliever and not obey the Lord of the Worlds in what He commanded him regarding prayer—this, O brother, it is not correct to say that he is not",

Correct, he is not able. But this one goes and engages in all the causes that stand between him and obedience to Allah, among them being that he enters a job that prevents him from performing obedience. So he says then \"he cannot.\" No, he can, but he preferred the worldly life over the Hereafter. That is why I was cautious about that question, because it is raised often, that \"one is not able.\" I imagine in many cases that the questioner is able, but the questioner, because he is not knowledgeable in Islam and the Law, imagines truly with all purity of soul that he is not able. But the one knowledgeable in the Book and the Sunnah clarifies the subject to him, and lo and behold, he is able. Therefore, I answered you in advance: if the question is in its place, \"Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity.\" But when we are in a realm where there is a way out from the claimed inability, then he must take the way out, and not throw himself into what he knows will cause him to fall short in performing what Allah Almighty has obligated upon him.

It is obligatory, in addition to this—which is the study of this knowledge—that every student be keen to act upon what he knows, so that his knowledge does not become a proof against him on one hand, and so that Allah, Blessed and Exalted, may benefit the people with his knowledge. Then, a third matter should be noted in that, which is: if we want to invite people to what Allah has bestowed upon us of guidance and light, we must be gentle with them, not be harsh with them, and not appear before them as being distinguished above them by this knowledge. We must consider the people, all the people whom we see far from the guidance of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, we must consider them as sick people. There is no doubt that spiritual sickness is more severe and harmful to its owner than physical bodily sickness. And if it is assumed for the physical doctor to be gentle with the patient—to the point that many say some patients are cured merely by hearing a kind word from their doctor—then it is more appropriate, and even more so, that the student of knowledge who undertakes guiding people and directing them to follow the Sunnah, and to follow what our righteous predecessors were upon, be gentle in inviting them, kind in dealing with them.

So his greeting was not clear that it was the greeting of Muslims, nor was it clear that it was a supplication for death—which is \"As-Sam\"—upon the Master of Messengers, and he did not pronounce it eloquently and explicitly. Naturally, he does not dare to address the Messenger, peace be upon him—while the state belonged to him on that day—by saying: \"As-Sam 'alayk\" (Death be upon you), meaning: death. But also, because of the humiliation, malice, and disbelief in the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, that was in his heart, he did not proceed to cast upon him, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, \"As-Salam\" (Peace), which is a name from the names of Allah Almighty, as came in the authentic Hadith. Rather, he mumbled it and wasted it, saying: \"As-Sam 'alaykum.\" It is a self-evident matter that this was not hidden from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, so he returned the greeting to him with brevity, the utmost brevity, by saying: \"Wa 'alaykum\" (And upon you). As for Sayyidah Aisha, being behind the curtain, she had barely heard this twisting of the greeting by that Jew when she said: \"And upon you be death, the curse, and wrath, O brothers of apes and pigs.\" When the Jew left, the Messenger, peace be upon him, said: \"What is this, O Aisha?\" She said: \"O Messenger of Allah, did you not hear what he said?\" He said to her: \"Did you not hear what I said, O Aisha?\"—and here is the witness—«Gentleness is not in anything except that it adorns it, and violence is not in anything except that it disgraces it.» If the Messenger, peace be upon him, says this to the one who addressed the Jews with that harsh tone, and she is Sayyidah Aisha, and she had a right to that because she understood from the Jew that he was praying for death upon the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family; then what should be our stance with our brothers who share with us at least in the two testimonies of faith?

    "text": "For this reason, it was from the commandment of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, to Muadh ibn Jabal and Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari, may Allah be pleased with them both, that when the Prophet, peace be upon him, sent them as callers to Yemen, he said to them: «Go and comply with each other, and make things easy and do not make them difficult.» So all of this makes us pay attention to be tolerant and easy-going with people in our call. And as I say on this occasion, and I often say: our call, praise be to Allah, is the call of truth, and people are heedless of the truth, and the word of truth is naturally heavy upon people. It is enough of a burden on people that we invite them to this truth which is heavy upon them; the weight of the word of truth is sufficient for them. That is what should deter us and prevent us from increasing the burden upon them by using a harsh style in our invitation of them to the truth. Because if the harshness of the style is added to the severity of the truth and its weight upon people—if the harshness of the truth and its weight upon them, which is truth, is joined with calling people—we should not add to this weight another weight which is not truth. In that case, this second weight acts as a barrier preventing people from accepting the truth which is heavy by its nature, as He, the Exalted, said: {Indeed, We will cast upon you a heavy word} [Al-Muzzammil: 5]. For this reason, it was from his words, peace be upon him, regarding Muadh in the story of his prolonging the recitation in the Isha prayer—that prolongation which drove one of the Ansar to cut his prayer behind him, pray alone, and go off to his house, leaving the congregation. When the news reached Muadh, he was severe in attacking this Ansari, to the point that he was saying about him: \"He is a hypocrite.\" Muadh, may Allah be pleased with him, used this word proceeding from a general principle, the general principle that Ibn Masoud speaks about in his long Hadith in \"Sahih Muslim\": «No one would stay behind from the congregational prayer except a hypocrite.» Likewise, there is another Hadith: «The one who is in the mosque and hears the Adhan and then leaves is a hypocrite.» Muadh used this",

So the Messenger, peace be upon him, sent for Muadh, as is known, and the Messenger, peace be upon him, said to him: «Are you a trial-maker (Fattan), O Muadh? Are you a trial-maker, O Muadh? Are you a trial-maker, O Muadh? It is sufficient for you to read \"By the Sun and its brightness\" (Ash-Shams) and \"By the night when it covers\" (Al-Layl) and similar Surahs. If one of you leads people, let him lighten [the prayer]» to the end of the Hadith. So the witness is that cruelty and harshness harm the call. Unfortunately, we notice in many of our brothers that the newer one is to the call, the harsher he is in it; because he imagines that harshness is beneficial in the call. The reality is that it harms. Sufficient for you in this regard is His saying, Almighty and Majestic: {And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have disbanded from about you} [Al Imran: 159]. I also see fit to mention that today we are afflicted with the opposite of what we were afflicted with in the previous past centuries. In the previous centuries, we were afflicted with the stagnation of scholars, let alone the students of knowledge, let alone the common people; we were afflicted with stagnation on sectarian imitation (Taqleed). This stagnation continued over the Muslims for long centuries. Now, there is a group, a blessed awakening to return to the Book and the Sunnah, and there is no doubt it has yielded its produce and ripe fruits. But we now complain of the opposite of that matter which we used to complain about before. We used to complain of stagnation, so now we complain of [unbridled] setting loose. Now everyone who hears the word \"Book and Sunnah,\" while he understands nothing of the Book and Sunnah except some phrases and some words he hears from some preachers—which might be words of truth, or might contain some error—he thinks that he has thereby become a scholar who is permitted to say: \"I see such-and-such,\" and \"My opinion is such-and-such,\" and \"I see this saying as wrong.\" He interferes in every big and small matter, while he does not do well in reading a [single] Hadith... and this has its dangers.

    "text": "followed [schools] and stagnation upon them, and between every Muslim becoming a claimant of knowledge, a claimant of Ijtihad (independent reasoning), then there is no doubt that remaining upon what the fathers and grandfathers were upon of following the Madhab and not relying on the opinions of the ignorant ones who have not studied knowledge, that is better. This is from the chapter of: \"Have mercy, some evil is lighter than others.\" It is true that some wise men or writers from the Iraqis said a very beautiful word, but it has a beautiful correction. He said: \"For me to strive (make Ijtihad) and err is dearer to me than to imitate and be correct.\" He said: \"I only said 'dearer to me' and not 'better', because for me to strive and err is dearer to me than to imitate and be correct—pardon, dearer to me than to strive and be correct—he said: I did not say 'better' because error is not better than correctness.\" Therefore, we must advise our brothers who share with us in the Call and adopting the Book and the Sunnah not to be deceived by themselves and not to be deceived by some information they took from others, which was not through their personal study. For this opens a door upon us regarding others that we have no capability to repel, because others argue against us saying that you allow those who do not know—they say where we are in the Levant (Sham): \"The Alif from the stick (Bastiyya)\" (meaning they can't distinguish the letter Alif from a long stick), and in some countries here they say: \"He doesn't know the five from the obliteration (tamsa).\" This is undoubtedly a fault taken against the Salafi Call. But undoubtedly, the Salafi Call does not acknowledge building personal opinions that stem from people who are not students of knowledge, even if they were students of knowledge but have not yet matured in knowledge. Therefore, we propose to these people that they not rely on their opinions and that they seek help from the people of knowledge; because the Noble Qur'an, as you know, made Muslims into two parts: a scholar, and a non-scholar. And this was the case in all previous eras, especially in the first century, the most luminous century, which is the century of the Messenger, peace be upon him, and his era.",

    "text": "For people were of two types: a scholar, and a non-scholar. This is what Allah Almighty meant by His saying: {So ask the people of the message if you do not know} [An-Nahl: 43]. Ibn al-Qayyim and others say: The scholars among the Companions who used to give fatwas to the people barely reached the number of two hundred persons, two hundred scholars. The thousands upon thousands and thousands upon thousands were not—as is the case with the millions, rather than thousands, due to the multitude of Muslims, masha'Allah, today on the face of the earth—it was not that these thousands upon thousands of Companions, each one would give an opinion, give a view. Rather, they used to apply His saying, the Exalted: {So ask the people of the message if you do not know}. Based on this verse, we must spread this truth among our Salafi youth and make them live by it, such that it is before their eyes always and forever: Are you a scholar? You strive, you understand the Book and the Sunnah? You are not a scholar. Then it is not your duty to say: \"I see such-and-such,\" and \"I strove and saw such-and-such,\" whether that is in authenticating a Hadith while he is not from the people of Hadith, or in deriving a ruling while he is not from the jurists (Fuqaha). So he must, then, realize this verse {So ask the people of the message if you do not know}. Because those who dare to give fatwas while they are not people of knowledge and fatwa, their likeness is as the likeness of that man whom the Messenger, peace be upon him, prayed against that Allah Almighty destroy him because he gave a fatwa due to which he caused the death of an innocent Muslim soul. You know this Hadith which Abu Dawood narrated in his «Sunan» (1): «That the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, sent a military expedition. When they fought the disbelievers and evening came and then morning rose upon them, one of them stood up having had a wet dream, and on his body were many wounds.

When his news reached the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, he prayed against him, saying: They killed him, may Allah kill them. Why did they not ask when they were ignorant? For indeed, the cure for ignorance (Al-'Ayy) is asking.» This Hadith must always and forever be present before the eyes of students of knowledge so that they do not dare to give fatwas and be afflicted, for example, by what afflicted that man whom the Messenger, peace be upon him, prayed against that Allah Blessed and Exalted fight him. Daring to give fatwas, it appears from the preceding speech, returns its evil consequences upon the Mufti first, and upon the one given the fatwa second. Thus, if this meaning settles in the students of knowledge who have not reached the knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah and tracking the sayings of the Imams and weighing and preferring between them—but rather merely say \"I see such-and-such\" and \"I understood such-and-such\"—[if they realize this], these people, to relieve themselves of the two calamities I pointed to first: that they fall into error themselves, and that they cause others to fall into error. That is by asking the people of knowledge, and it is not upon them afterwards whether the one who gave the fatwa was wrong or right. Because if he was right, then excellent; and if he was wrong, then his sin is only upon the one who gave him the fatwa. So instead of bearing the burden himself because he gave a fatwa without knowledge and implicated the one he gave the fatwa to without knowledge, let him place the sin on another if he gave him a fatwa without knowledge. This does not mean that our youth should not investigate in their questioning of the people of knowledge to distinguish between a scholar and a scholar, between a claimant of knowledge and a true scholar, and between a scholar of a Madhab and those ignorant of the Book and the Sunnah. This is another issue. The important thing is that he asks one whose knowledge he trusts, and whose religion he trusts. At that time, he will not fall into the problem that the one who gave the fatwa fell into, that he must wash; and due to his ignorance of the Sunnah, he did not give him the fatwa of the permissibility of Tayammum because water harmed him, and indeed it harmed him and was the cause of his death. So this is a word, and perhaps I have prolonged it. I hope from Allah Almighty that He grants us success to act upon beneficial knowledge, and that He makes us know our own selves, and that He does not make us among those deceived by them; for vanity is a destruction beyond which there is no destruction.

He who knows it knows it, and he who is ignorant of it is ignorant of it. It appears to some of them, and is hidden from others. Therefore, the duty of the true Muslim is to hasten to obey Allah, and not to hesitate in that until the wisdom becomes clear to him, for that contradicts faith which is absolute submission to the Wise Lawgiver. Therefore, He, Almighty and Majestic, said in the Noble Qur'an: {But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission}. Upon this, our righteous predecessors lived, so Allah honored them, and opened for them the lands and the hearts of the servants. The latter part of this nation will not be rectified except by that which rectified its first part. Indeed, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, had the winning shaft (precedence) in it, and he was a righteous example for others, as indicated by his magnificent stance in the story of the Treaty of Hudaibiya, in what Sahl bin Hunaif, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated, saying: \"O people!

Al-Hafiz said (13/ 288): «It is as if he said: Accuse the opinion if it opposes the Sunnah, as happened to us where the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, commanded us to decompose [from Ihram], but we loved to continue upon Ihram and we wanted fighting to complete our rituals and conquer our enemy, and what appeared to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, of what happened in the outcome was hidden from us.» The most magnificent example I came across in the biography of his companions, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, indicating their preference for obeying him, even if that was contrary to their desire and personal interest, is the saying of Zahir bin Rafi who said: «The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, forbade us from a matter that was beneficial for us, but obedience to Allah and His Messenger is more beneficial for us. He forbade us from sharecropping (Muhaqala) with the land, renting it for a third or a quarter or named food.»",

It guides to the right course, so we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.'\"}.

Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: «They marveled at the obedience of his companions to him.» Narrated by Ahmad (1/ 270) and others with an authentic chain.

For we find in many gatherings where a wide scientific circle is held, as was the case when we entered this blessed place, God willing, where it was assumed that people sit at the edges of this spacious place. There is no harm in sitting in such a seating in other than a scientific session. As for the scientific session, its etiquette is joining together, gathering, and clumping so that the Muslims gathering to seek knowledge are not distant with their bodies from one another; because the apparent is the title of the hidden, as came in many hadiths from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. Among these hadiths related to the etiquette of sitting in seeking knowledge is that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, entered his mosque one day and saw people scattered in separate circles, so he said to them: «Why do I see you in separate groups ('Izzin)?» meaning: separated. And this Hadith is in the Sahih of Imam Muslim.

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, was concerned with gathering people and warned them against separating in their bodies and figures even if they were in the open or the desert. Imam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad from the Hadith of Abu Tha'labah Al-Khushani, may Allah Almighty be pleased with him, who said: «When we used to travel with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, we would disperse in the mountain passes and valleys. So he said to us one day: Indeed, this dispersion of yours is from the work of Satan.» They were not in a scientific session, but rather on a trip in the wilderness; they used to disperse, each taking a side under shading trees or a moist valley or the like. So he, peace and blessings be upon him, disapproved of that dispersion and said: «Indeed, this dispersion of yours is from the work of Satan.» Abu Tha'labah, may Allah Almighty be pleased with him, said: So after that, when we camped in a valley, we gathered together, such that if we sat on a carpet, it would hold us. They responded to Allah and the Messenger when he called them, so they would not separate in their dwellings while they were travelers; they used to gather. What is the secret in the Prophet's care, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, in gathering people, and not allowing them to separate in their bodies even in the desert? What is the secret? I previously indicated that, but an indication in many cases does not substitute for an explicit phrase. Rather, an explicit phrase sometimes needs explanation, commentary, and clarification, so I must provide some of this. I said previously: Because the apparent is the title of the hidden, meaning: if Muslims separate in their outward appearances, that is a cause and a motive for them to separate in their hearts.

But few are the people who know firstly what the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, used to say to the people when he commanded them to straighten the rows. He, peace and blessings be upon him, used to say: «You must straighten your rows, or Allah will surely alter between your faces (hearts).» And this Hadith, with deep regret, is from the practical Sunnah of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, from one angle, and the verbal Sunnah from another angle. That is because he used to straighten the rows and urge them to care about straightening, and warn them against misalignment, and inform them that this misalignment is a cause for separation between their hearts: «You must straighten your rows, or Allah will surely alter between your faces.» We see today that most Imams of mosques—I do not exclude from them the Imams of the Sacred Mosque and the Prophetic Mosque, let alone other mosques—all of them have failed to care about straightening the rows, and warning people against misalignment in straightening them. You barely hear from the best of them [anything but] one who says: \"Straighten up right and left,\" and the matter ends. As for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and his companions the Righteous Caliphs after him, they used to care a very, very great deal. So one of them would not say the opening Takbir (Takbirat al-Ihram) until he was reassured that the people responded to the command to straighten the rows, on one hand. And [on the other hand], the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and likewise his companions after him, were not content with just the word: \"Straighten... Straighten,\" nor saying only to this one \"move forward\" and to that one \"move back.\" Rather, he, peace be upon him, and his noble companions used to present before that incentives and encouragements so that people would respond to the call of the Messenger, peace be upon him, in straightening the row. In addition to the previous Hadith: «You must straighten your rows,» he, peace be upon him, used to say: «Straighten your rows;",

And his command, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, for a thing implies that this thing is obligatory to apply and implement; because Allah Almighty said regarding His Prophet, peace be upon him: {He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah} [An-Nisa: 80]. And He said: {So let those beware who dissent from the Prophet's order, lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment} [An-Nur: 63]. For this, attention should be paid that people straighten up in prayer and be close in the scientific gathering outside of prayer in response to the command of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. And in some of these commands is the justification for that; because rectifying the outward appearances is a legal cause for rectifying the inward states. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, mentioned this meaning also in some authentic Hadiths which you must have heard often, but I believe that few scholars remind you of the wisdom that was mentioned or indicated in the Hadith that you always heard, which is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him and his family: «Indeed, the Halal is clear, and the Haram is clear, and between them are ambiguous matters which many people do not know. So whoever guards against doubtful matters has sought to clear his religion and his honor. Beware, for every king has a sanctuary. Beware, for the sanctuary of Allah is His prohibitions. Beware, for whoever grazes around the sanctuary is bound to fall into it. Beware—and here is the witness—indeed there is a morsel of flesh in the body; if it is sound, the whole body is sound, and if it is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt. Beware, it is the heart.» Therefore: the soundness of the heart implies the soundness of the body. These are from the secrets of the Sharia which the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, drew attention to in this Hadith; because he indicates in this Hadith and in other Hadiths that",

So it is as if there is a permanent, continuous movement resembling what we used to and still hear, that they are trying to reach the discovery of what they call perpetual motion. Perpetual motion was created by Allah Blessed and Exalted in this human whom He formed and perfected his form. That movement is: if you rectify your heart, the rectitude of your body necessarily follows; and if you rectify your body, the rectitude of your heart necessarily follows. Therefore: Let no one say—as we hear often from some youth who were not raised with an Islamic upbringing, and violated many legal pillars like prayer, for example—if it is said to them: O brother, why do you not pray? He says to you: The consideration is what is in the heart. As if he says or imagines that it is possible for the heart to be righteous, correct, and sound, while the body does not respond to the legal rulings. This is a matter that is utterly false. So we must notice this truth, which is the connection of the apparent with the hidden, and that the rectitude of one of them implies nothing but the rectitude of the other, and that the corruption of one of them implies nothing but the corruption of the other. Thus: From here we understand why the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, used to command people to gather and join together in the assembly of knowledge, because this outward physical joining affects the joining of hearts and the mutual love that must be realized in the heart of every Muslim, as came in many Hadiths urging love for the sake of Allah and visiting each other for the sake of Allah, which is known to you. The intention is that I wanted to point to this Sunnah which students of knowledge should follow, not to enlarge the scientific circle, but to make it smaller as much as they can, so that some of them are close to others, and all of them are also close to this person who undertakes teaching them and guiding them to what benefits them in their worldly life and their Hereafter.",

    "text": "After this word, I want to remind, as the Exalted said: {And remind, for indeed, the reminder benefits the believers} [Adh-Dhariyat: 55]. Every Muslim knows that Islam is built upon two foundations to which there is no third: namely, the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. This is a truth about which no two differ, and about which no two goats would butt heads, as they used to say in ancient times. And so, if this is a truth known to every Muslim, then why did Muslims differ in the past and recently, while all of them say: \"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\"? And the faith of a Muslim is not complete except with these two testimonies: with the good word \"La ilaha illa Allah\" (There is no god but Allah), and by testifying to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, of Prophethood and Message. But is it sufficient, for a Muslim to be saved in this world before the Hereafter, to say this good word and the second testimony with his tongue while he does not yet understand what is the meaning of \"La ilaha illa Allah\" and what are its implications? And he also does not know the implications of his saying: \"And I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\" We must stop at this point, and I repeat the alert: All Muslims say \"La ilaha illa Allah Muhammad Rasul Allah.\" If it is assumed that anyone refuses, he is not on the path of Islam. Since the matter is so, what is the reason for what occurred in the past and still occurs recently of the difference that Allah Almighty informed about with a general statement, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, detailed in some of his Hadiths with detail? The Exalted said: {And if your Lord had willed, He could have made mankind one community; but they will not cease to differ * Except whom your Lord has given mercy} [Hud: 118 - 119].

The meaning of this is that the Muslim should not be satisfied with saying: \"La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammad Rasul Allah\"; because this Ummah which will say this good word will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one sect.

Perhaps we all know—some of us know with certainty, but perhaps all of us present know the following verse—the Exalted said addressing His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family: {And We revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl: 44]. {The Reminder} meaning: the Noble Qur'an, where the Exalted said: {Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder and indeed, We will be its guardian} [Al-Hijr: 9]. The first verse, our Lord Almighty says in it: And We revealed to you, O Muhammad, this Reminder, the Qur'an, so that you only recite it to the people? He must recite it, and had he, peace be upon him, not recited it, we would not have known it nor would it have reached us. But is his duty, peace and blessings be upon him, limited to reciting the Qur'an only to the people, and for them to learn it from him as it happened, or is there another duty our Lord Almighty commanded him to perform? The answer: Yes, where He said: {And We revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them}. So in this verse, there is what can be pointed to with two words, or two terms. First: In this verse is a clarified matter (Mubayyan), which is the Qur'an. And in this verse is a clarifier (Mubayyin), which is the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. So the clarified Qur'an is the Speech of Allah, and the speech of the clarifying Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, is his Hadith and his Sunnah. Therefore: There is no way to be knowledgeable of what the Saved Sect was upon except by resorting to the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. This is also a fact that none of the Muslims disagree on at all, meaning that the Qur'an, the Messenger, peace be upon him, undertook its explanation. And among the clearest",

We do not find in the Noble Qur'an five prayers... we do not find in the Noble Qur'an the details of the Rak'ahs: Fajr is two Rak'ahs, Dhuhr, Asr and Isha are four, and Maghrib is distinguished from all these prayers by being three Rak'ahs. From where did we know these details? From the Clarifier, who is he, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. His clarification, then, is in his Sunnah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. His Sunnah, as the scholars of Hadith mention, is divided into three parts: his saying, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, his action, and his approval. His saying, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, is known: everything that ran on his tongue, peace be upon him, regarding that clarification: {And We revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl: 44]. So this is his saying, as came in the Hadith of Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-Aas, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he was in a gathering where there was a mix of polytheists. This Ibn Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, was the keenest of all Companions on writing, to write what he heard from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, out of his keenness to preserve it. So the polytheists in that gathering raised an objection to him. They said to him: \"You write from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, what he speaks in the state of contentment and anger?\" As if they were saying: It is reasonable to write what he speaks in the state of contentment, but to also write what he says in this anger? They disapproved of his intense keenness on writing. It was as if a doubt entered his soul, so he hastened to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and mentioned to him what the polytheists said to him. He, peace be upon him, did nothing but raise his finger to his mouth and said to him: «Write, for by the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad! Nothing comes out of it except truth.» This is from the Sunnah, his saying, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. The second part is his action; so everything he, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, did contains guidance and light, based on details for which there is no room to mention now. The third part comes: what he, peace be upon him, saw as an action from someone else and then remained silent about it",

Here comes, after this explanation of the Sunnah, an explanation of something that was mentioned in the Hadith of the Saved Sect... Now the situation is natural and praise be to Allah, the atmosphere is good. He, peace be upon him, said—and I hope you remember with me his saying when he was asked about the Saved Sect, he said: «What I and my companions are upon.» He did not limit it to his saying: «What I am upon» meaning: what he is upon of the verbal, practical, and approval-based Sunnah. He added to that: «and my companions.» Therefore: We cannot turn a blind eye to what the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, were upon. Why? If you reflect on the third part of his Sunnah, peace be upon him, which is that he sees someone else doing an action and performing a deed then he approves it, this thing becomes part of the Sunnah. Who was doing this action? It is someone other than him, peace be upon him; it is his companions. Therefore: A Muslim cannot live a correct Islamic life except by knowing the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, and knowing what his companions were upon. And from here you know with me the importance of what came in the Hadith of Al-Irbad bin Sariyah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said in it: «The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, gave us an admonition by which the hearts were filled with fear and eyes shed tears. We said: O Messenger of Allah! Advise us? He said: I advise you to fear Allah and to hear and obey, even if an Abyssinian slave is appointed over you; for whoever among you lives will see much difference.» Now connect this saying with the previous verse: {But they will not cease to differ * Except whom your Lord has given mercy} [Hud: 118 - 119].",

This last point is what most Muslims today are heedless of. All of them say: \"Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family,\" and all of them call to following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, even if they differ in applying this Sunnah; because they differ in the abundance of acquaintance with it in knowledge or the lack of acquaintance with it. But as He said: {But most of the people do not know} [Al-A'raf: 187], most of them do not pay attention to what came in the Hadith of the Saved Sect, and in the Hadith of Al-Irbad bin Sariyah of the command also for something else in addition to the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, which is the Sunnah of the Companions, and especially the Righteous Caliphs among them. Is there in the Noble Qur'an—which enumerated everything related to the fundamentals of religion and its rules—is there in the Noble Qur'an even one phrase indicating this meaning which I gathered and collected for you from numerous and numerous Hadiths? The answer: Yes; the Exalted said: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the believers' way, We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115].",

Allah was capable of that, so why then? What is the wisdom of His coupling, Mighty and Majestic, His saying: {and follows other than the believers' way} to: {opposes the Messenger}? I think you knew the secret from the Hadiths we presented to you. {and follows other than the believers' way} The secret is that those first believers are the ones who transmitted to us what they heard from the Messenger, peace be upon him, from his mouth fresh and tender, and they found it applied in his era, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, a practical application. So they are able to understand what Allah sent down to His Prophet of His Book and what His Prophet, peace be upon him, uttered in his wording. They are able to understand that better than everyone who comes after them. How could it not be so, when the matter is as he, peace be upon him, said: «The witness sees what the absent does not see» (1). Take for example, the Exalted said: {And the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands} [Al-Ma'idah: 38]. The hand (Yad) in the language is used to mean the palm, and used to mean the forearm with the palm, and used to mean the forearm with the upper arm. Now! How are we to understand the hand in this verse: {amputate their hands}? Just as there is in the verse of Tayammum: {so take clean sand and wipe over your faces and hands} [An-Nisa: 43].",

If we do not return to the Clarifier referred to in the first verse: {And We revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl: 44], we would differ and become confused; that is because the Noble Qur'an was revealed in a clear Arabic tongue, and the hand has these numerous meanings. However, when we return to the Companions and find them transmitting the Sharia of Allah applied by the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, and they understood this Sharia correctly, then it is no wonder that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, praised them, saying: «The best of people are my generation», and he said: «Honor my companions». And he said: «Do good to my companions, for by the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad! If one of you were to spend the like of Mount Uhud in gold, it would not reach a mudd (a measure) of one of them nor half of it». That is because they strove in the cause of Allah, migrated in the cause of Allah, left their homelands in the cause of Allah, accompanied the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, and knew the Sharia of Allah, as we said, closely and from near. Therefore: they are as he, peace be upon him, said in some hadiths: «They are the people whose companion is not wretched». Therefore: everyone who wants to be from the Saved Sect must not be content only with knowing the Qur'an and the Sunnah alone.

So, the Muslim must become acquainted with what his companions, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were upon, otherwise, he will go far astray while thinking he is doing good work. The new thing now that I want to expand upon a little is: what is the path to knowing what the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, was upon in terms of speech, action, and approval, and what his companions, peace be upon him, inherited from him of guidance or guidance and light? What is the path? If a questioner asked us what is the path to knowing the speech of Allah Almighty, the answer, and praise be to Allah, is easy and facilitated: it is the Noble Qur'an. We have no book that Allah Almighty undertook to preserve except this Noble Qur'an, as He said in the previously mentioned verse: {Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian} [Al-Hijr: 9]. So Allah Almighty undertook the preservation of this Divine Speech, which is the Qur'an. He did not undertake the preservation of the Torah, nor the Gospel, nor the Scrolls of Abraham and Moses; that is because His wisdom dictated that these previous laws be a preparation for the Islamic Sharia, after which there is no Sharia. So it was of profound wisdom that our Lord Almighty undertook the preservation of this Noble Qur'an. Thus: the answer to the question 'what is the path to knowing the speech of Allah?' is the Noble Qur'an. But the very, very important question is: What is the way to knowing the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and what his noble companions were upon? Here is the very, very important research; it is what is known among all Muslim scholars as the Science of",

The Science of Hadith comprises two sciences: one known as the Science of Hadith Terminology (Mustalah al-Hadith) and the other is the Science of Disparagement and Praise (Jarh wa Ta'dil). The Science of Hadith Terminology consists of scientific rules that scholars of Hadith collected over time, recorded, classified, simplified, and explained to the people; so that they could distinguish the authentic (Sahih) from the weak (Da'if) hadith. So what is this? It is the second science, the Science of Disparagement and Praise. The Science of Disparagement and Praise revolves around knowing the biographies of the thousands upon thousands of narrators of Hadith and Sunnah. Perhaps you all know something known among the scholars of Hadith as the Isnad (Chain of Transmission). The Isnad is a chain of men taking from one another; it starts with the Companion reporting from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, the Follower (Tabi'i) from the Companion, the Follower of the Follower from the Follower, and so on; until these hadiths were recorded with these chains of transmission in the known books of Sunnah, the number of which, by the will of Allah, exceeds thousands upon thousands. But the most famous of them are the Six Books, which are circulated today in the hands of the scholars of Sunnah. This Isnad is composed of men; these men are numbered, as we said, in thousands upon thousands. Each man among them has a biography in the books of Disparagement and Praise, stating when this narrator existed, when he was born, when he lived, who his teachers were, who his students who took from him were... and so on. Added to that is whether he is trustworthy (Thiqah), just ('Adl), immoral (Fasiq), a memorizer (Hafiz), or having poor memory. All these descriptions and others are also mentioned in this science, the Science of Disparagement and Praise. And all of you, I assume, know that the hadiths found in the bellies of books and circulated on the tongues of people contain what is authentic and what is not authentic.",

For whoever combines these two sciences is able to distinguish the authentic from the weak. So where are we today regarding this science which enables us to know the authentic from the weak? This knowledge is what connects us to the Saved Sect, otherwise, we will be far, far away, much or little, depending on the knowledge or ignorance of this Science of Hadith and Science of Disparagement and Praise. If you know this truth, then the disagreement that occurred in the past between the Islamic sects, and which continues to this day, one of its greatest causes is the turning away—I do not say of the general Muslims, but I say the turning away of the elite Muslims—from studying this science and spreading it, and from presenting its fruits to all Muslims so that they may be as the Lord of the Worlds said in the Noble Qur'an: {Say, \"This is my way; I invite to Allah with insight, I and those who follow me. And exalted is Allah; and I am not of those who associate others with Him.\"} [Yusuf: 108]. Thus: one of the causes of the continuous disagreement is the distancing from studying this science, in short, the Science of Hadith. There is another reason; this was in the past, before scholars whom Allah Almighty subjected to serve Islam by serving the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him, became available to collect the Sunnah. As for today, this reason has disappeared, and the reason of neglecting the study of this science remains. As for the reason that has disappeared, you must know it; because it entails that you know the reason for the disagreement of Muslim scholars from old times until today in some jurisprudential issues. You all know, Allah willing, that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, had different situations when he spoke.

Sometimes there would be some Companions in the mosque, so he would speak and they would memorize from him, whereas the other Companions would not know what he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, spoke of in that gathering around which there were only a few individuals. Similarly, he used to travel, and those travelers who were with him took from him knowledge that those residing in Medina or Mecca or... etc., missed. And so the scenarios multiply, and each of you can be creative in listing them and recalling them in his mind. Examples of this include that he used to live in his house with his family, his wives, and his grandsons, so speech would occur between him, peace be upon him, and his family which is hadith that his Companions did not know at all; those outside the house had no knowledge of it, rather his family and wives are the ones who knew what happened in the house. Therefore: We cannot imagine a single individual from the Companions encompassing knowledge of all the hadiths of the Messenger, peace be upon him. This is an impossible matter; because an individual cannot be the shadow of the Messenger, peace be upon him, wherever he went, wherever he attended, wherever he sat, wherever he traveled, being with him; this is an impossible matter. The intent of all this speech, which is very self-evident, is that the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family—and we have known that it is his speech, action, and approval—was scattered among his Companions. So, was there a person in that time who could contact every individual of the Messenger, peace be upon him, and collect from them what they heard and what they witnessed from him, peace be upon him? Imagining this saves you from saying this is an impossible matter, especially if you remember the Islamic Conquests which necessitated that the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, disperse in the lands.

And as you know, Masha'Allah, the Islamic Conquests reached east to China and west to Spain, which was known then as Al-Andalus. Was it possible then for a person to catch up with these Companions who dispersed in the lands for the sake of Jihad? This is also an impossible matter. However, a nucleus began as a first attempt to collect what some of these individuals possessed by some of the Successors (Tabi'un). They were keen to contact some of the Companions. The one who established the sunnah of collecting from various Companions as much as was easy for him for these Successors was Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him. Abu Hurairah is the Memorizer (Hafiz) who can deserve this title among the Companions of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, even though he did not accept Islam until about two and a half years before his death, peace be upon him. Yet, he narrated the most hadith among the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. Why? He tells us about himself, saying: I used to be content filling my belly with small bites, then after that, I would sit with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, and take hadith from him. This is one reason. And he adds to that that his companions, peace be upon him, were busy with deals in the markets, busy with trade; but they are the ones whom the Lord of the Worlds praised by His saying: {Men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of Allah and performance of prayer} [An-Nur: 37]. But Abu Hurairah was unique among them in that he was ascetic and satisfied with small bites, then [spent] the rest of the time with the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, as if he knew that his acceptance of Islam was late, so he wanted to compensate his Islam for what he missed of the long companionship enjoyed by the likes of Abu Bakr, Umar, and the first forerunners of the Companions. Therefore, he turned away from the whole world and turned to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. The second thing that made him the Memorizer of the Companions is that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, said one day: «Who will spread his garment and then memorize everything he hears from me?» Abu Hurairah was the first to do so, so he spread his garment,",

The third reason, which is the point of evidence, is that he was not content with hearing from the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, only. He used to go to the Companions, Abu Bakr, Umar, and others... and others, and pick up from them what they had memorized from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. Therefore: he is the one who established for the Successors and those after them the collection of hadiths from different narrators. That is why the student of Abu Hurairah's hadith notices that his hadiths are divided into two parts; in some of them, he says \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family,\" and in most of them he says: \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, said.\" This is due to his precision and honesty regarding what he heard from him, peace be upon him, he says: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah saying,\" and regarding what he heard from others, he does not say: \"I heard from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family,\" but rather says \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, said.\" The reason is that his Islam was late and what he heard from the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, was little, so he wanted to make up for what he missed by contacting his old companions, so he collected from them. Thus, due to these three reasons, he was the Companion of the Messenger, peace be upon him, with the most hadith. That is why now those occupied with the Science of Hadith and books of Hadith find Abu Hurairah's hadiths in every book of the Sunnah having the highest precedence in number and quantity. Take for example a very clear example, the Musnad of Imam Ahmad, six volumes. The second volume of it, half of it belongs to Abu Hurairah. Out of six volumes containing the hadiths of all the Companions—this which Imam Ahmad was able to collect by the method I pointed to, contacting people and collecting hadiths—Abu Hurairah's Musnad in Imam Ahmad's Musnad took half of the second volume, meaning: one out of twelve. So Allah Almighty blessed Abu Hurairah with these reasons, and among them [the method] by which a Muslim is enabled",

But the Successors began collecting from this Companion and that Companion. If one had limited himself to the hadiths of a single Companion, the quantity would have been small, but he added to it the hadiths of the second and third Companion according to what was easy for him. Then came the turn of the Followers of the Successors (Atba' al-Tabi'in), so the circle of collection expanded. Then came the turn of the Followers of the Successors, among whom were the Six Imams, the authors of the Six Books: Imam Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah. These, due to their travel to the lands which the first Companions had opened and then the Successors followed them and so on—due to this movement, abundant Sunnah became available to each of them, Masha'Allah. The one with the most of it was Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him; because he traveled for the sake of collecting Hadith to most of the lands of the world at that time. Imam Shafi'i testified to his memorization, knowing that Imam Shafi'i is one of Imam Ahmad's teachers in Hadith, Tafsir, and Fiqh. Imam Shafi'i is one of Imam Ahmad's teachers, but Imam Ahmad distinguished himself over the scholars of his time by devoting himself completely like Abu Hurairah, so he did not work for the world and its adornment. He roamed the lands and contacted the narrators of Hadith, so he collected thousands upon thousands of the Sunnah. His teacher Imam Shafi'i testified to that for him, saying to him: \"O Ahmad: You are more knowledgeable about Hadith than me.\" The Sheikh says to his student: \"You are more knowledgeable about Hadith than me, so if an authentic hadith comes to you, inform me of it or let me know of it, whether it is Hijazi, Levantine (Shami), Egyptian, or... or... etc.\" He indicates that Imam Ahmad roamed and traveled to these lands and collected of the Sunnah what his Imam Shafi'i was not able to collect.

    "text": "The Four [Imams]: Abu Hanifa, Malik, Shafi'i, and Ahmad, is this which I tell you: that the Sunnah was dispersed by the dispersion of its bearers from the Companions, then the Successors. After that came the role of these four Imams. For the first of them, as you know, was Abu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy on him, and he died in the year 150 AH, so he is considered among the junior Successors. However, may Allah have mercy on him, he specialized in Fiqh (Jurisprudence) and did not leave Kufa except as a pilgrim or performing Umrah, so his hadith was little. After him came Imam Malik, where Imam Malik was born in the year Abu Hanifa died, and he resided in the Abode of Migration, Medina Al-Munawwarah. And Medina Al-Munawwarah, as is its reality today, considering it is frequented and intended by performers of Umrah and pilgrims, scholars there are numerous. Therefore, Malik's hadith—and he also did not travel or go out to collect Hadith—was more than Abu Hanifa's. Then came the turn of the third Imam, who is Imam Shafi'i. He resided, may Allah have mercy on him, in Baghdad, and Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphs as you know, so it was also a haven and refuge for various scholars. So he acquired of knowledge and Sunnah, Masha'Allah. Then he traveled from Baghdad to Egypt, and from here he acquired new material of knowledge, especially the Science of Hadith. So he surpassed the first two Imams, Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Shafi'i [sic - meant Malik], because he resided a large part of his life in Baghdad in addition to performing Hajj and Umrah, then he spent the end of his life in Egypt, so gathered for him of Hadith what did not gather for the first two Imams. The fourth Jurist Imam came, who is Ahmad bin Hanbal. He did not only surpass the three Imams, but he surpassed masses of Hadith scholars due to the abundance of encompassing the Sunnah. So he was the most memorizing of them for the Sunnah and more knowledgeable than many of the scholars of Hadith about Hadith. For this reason, a scholar like Abu Hanifa would be asked about an issue, so he would look into what he had of the Book of Allah and the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, and issue a fatwa based on what he had. If he did not find [a text], he exercised Ijtihad (independent reasoning),",

    "text": "and Ijtihad is necessary; because the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, said: «If a judge judges and exercises Ijtihad and is correct, he has two rewards; and if he errs, he has one reward». But as you understand from this hadith, Ijtihad is prone to correctness and error. One of the other Imams might be asked the same question, and he would answer with an answer from the material of Hadith he possesses which the Imam who issued a fatwa by his own Ijtihad did not obtain. So if you know this historical fact related to the method of collecting Hadith, the confusion will disappear from your minds regarding the cause of the Imams' disagreement. And regarding disagreement, we mentioned earlier His Almighty's saying: {But they will not cease to differ * Except whom your Lord has given mercy} [Hud: 118-119]. And they are undoubtedly shown mercy, so why did they differ? They are excused because they were not able to collect the Sunnah back then. As for today, we are not excused. The reason is that today we can gather the efforts of the Imams who passed and spent their lives in all eras. We gather them by buying their wealth, which is priceless, for a few counted coins. It is the book Musnad Ahmad, six volumes, his scientific life he included in it. You can dedicate only a year of your life at most, and obtain the knowledge of Imam Ahmad which he acquired over years and with great, abundant effort, which is roaming the lands and traveling to them. But the ailment of people today is asceticism (lack of interest) in the Science of Hadith, and turning away from studying Hadith, and contentment that any hadith we find in any book is—as that Bedouin said—(Khosh Hadith - Nice Hadith). But you know that the hadiths of the Messenger, peace be upon him, contain the authentic and the weak. The Messenger, peace be upon him, had been informed by Allah Almighty in advance that people would lie about him. And they lied about him even during his era, peace be upon him; during his lifetime, there was found one who lied about him. So he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, said: «Whoever lies about me intentionally, let him take his seat in",

    "text": "the Fire». How was this? A man loved a woman, so he went to her family to propose to her. In order for them to respond to him and not reject him, he said to them: I am the messenger of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, to you, ordering you to marry your young woman to me. The people and the guardian of the young woman found such a command strange; because they know that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, is as the Lord of the Worlds described him: {And indeed, you are of a great moral character} [Al-Qalam: 4]. Is it reasonable that the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, sends them an order to marry so-and-so while they do not know him? It is not reasonable, but there might be revelation or something. Therefore: Let us send to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. When they came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah! Did you send so-and-so? He said: No. Catch the man; if you find him, burn him in the fire. But I do not see that you will catch him. And indeed, when they chased him, they found that a viper snake had bitten him and his death was in it. This is the reason for his saying, peace be upon him: «Whoever lies about me intentionally, let him take his seat in the Fire». And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: «Indeed, lies will be told about me; so whoever lies about me...» to the end. And other hadiths came so that the Muslim is not deceived to say: I do not intend to lie about him, and thus takes lightly narrating Hadith and attributing Hadith to the Messenger, peace be upon him, without verifying its authenticity. So he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: «Whoever narrates a hadith while he sees [thinks] it is a lie, then he is one of the liars». Whoever narrates a hadith thinking it is a lie against the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, then he is one of the liars. So, in order for you to know whether this hadith is lied about the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, or not? What is the path? A path of two paths, there is no third, like legal rulings. To know that this is Halal and this is Haram, what is the path?",

So either you are a scholar, so seek a ruling from yourself, or you are not a scholar, so seek a ruling from your scholar. Ask the people of the message if you do not know. Every science has men, whether this science is religious or worldly. Any human now who wants to build a house does not act from his own head, but brings an engineer, an architect, a builder... And so if he wants to treat himself or treat a patient, he does not treat [him himself] but goes to the doctor and the specialist doctor, etc. Religious knowledge, in its two parts, Hadith and Fiqh, is more deserving that Muslims care about this rule which the Lord of the Worlds laid down in the previous verse: {So ask the people of the message if you do not know} [An-Nahl: 43]. So what is the path to knowing Halal and Haram? We said either you are a scholar, so ask your knowledge, or you are not a scholar, so ask the jurists. What is the path to knowing the authentic hadith from the weak? If you are a scholar, ask your knowledge. If you are not a scholar: {So ask the people of the message if you do not know} [An-Nahl: 43]. People today have not given the Science of Hadith, even in this last aspect, what it deserves of attention. Fiqh, most of them care about their religion to know the Haram and Halal, and therefore people from this angle are still fine. But it is very, very rare to find someone who cares about knowing [the status of] the hadith he hears or the hadith he reads, to ask the people of knowledge if this hadith is authentic or not. Merely hearing or reading, he stops at what he heard or read. Let him remember the threat",

    "text": "warning against narrating hadiths except after verifying their authenticity. Therefore: Here too, there must be a summary after that summary. I say: For a Muslim to be upon the Sunnah and upon what the Companions were upon, there is no way to that except by knowing the Science of Hadith. For the Science of Hadith is what informs you of what he, peace be upon him, used to say, do, and approve. And the Science of Hadith is what guides you to what his companions, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were upon regarding guidance, knowledge, morals, behavior, and the like. So I advise all Muslims in general to care about the Science of Hadith and verification in what they read and what they hear. And I advise their elite to care about studying the Science of Hadith so they can spread authentic hadiths among the people; because these authentic hadiths only are what lead them to know firstly the Saved Sect and to be part of it secondly, otherwise they are in great danger. And this amount is sufficient, especially since I see that slumber has begun to tickle some eyes. In my experience, if we open the door for questions, there might be some movement, wakefulness, and blessing, Allah willing. So whoever has an observation, whoever has a question related to what was previously presented and explained of the scientific approach that Muslims, their elite and general public, must follow, let him prefer and present the question related to what has passed. And if there is no question related to what has passed, we accept any other question related to understanding the religion. (Al-Huda wan-Noor /445/ 46: 19: 00) (Al-Huda wan-Noor /445/ 48: 47: 00)",

The Sheikh: This is an awakening, this is the start of the awakening, but we want to hear a third thing, which is: Allah said, the Messenger said, the Righteous Predecessors (As-Salaf As-Salih) said. Without the third and last statement, a scholar cannot truly be a believer in what came in the Book and the Sunnah. He can never be upon guidance from his Lord in his interpretation of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, unless he resorts to receiving that from the Companions of the Messenger, and follows the path of the first believers. {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him} [An-Nisa: 115]. Allah did not say immediately: {We will turn him to what he has turned} [An-Nisa: 115], but rather He conjoined with opposing the Messenger, saying: {and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115]. Did Allah say: {and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115] in vain? Far be it from Allah Almighty. So why this sentence? Was it not enough for Allah to say: And whoever opposes the Messenger, We will turn him to what he has turned? Even after guidance has become clear to him? It would have been enough if we wanted to rely only on the Book and the Sunnah. But Allah Almighty, for a clear and apparent wisdom, said: {and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115]. And—peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family—when he admonishes his companions, he draws their attention and emphasizes to their hearing repeatedly and reiteratively to take his Sunnah and the Sunnah of his companions. And he, peace be upon him, said when describing the Saved Sect that it is the one that is upon what the Messenger was upon only? Rather, he conjoined and said: «What I and my companions are upon",

Also in the hadith of Irbad bin Sariyah, and it is well-known and I have no need to cite it in its entirety, but the evidence from it is: «So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Righteous Guided Caliphs after me». The secret in this: is that they are the trustworthy transmitters who transmitted to us the application of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, of the texts of the Book and the wordings of his hadiths. Take for example some Qur'anic verses, and among the most important of them is what relates to some legal limits (Hudud). He Almighty said: {[As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands} [Al-Ma'idah: 38]. The thief (As-Sariq) linguistically: No one who is an Arab can be ignorant of what 'thief' means. And that any human who stole something, no matter how slight and very small this thing is; he is a thief. Likewise, the hand: {amputate their hands} [Al-Ma'idah: 38]. The hand is also known. But the thief, as is known, has several forms: he steals a needle, he steals an egg, he steals a chicken, he steals to infinity. All these thefts of all types, the thief is called: a thief. So is the hand of every thief cut? The answer: No. From where do we get this from the Qur'an? The Qur'an spoke generally saying: And the thief. Yes, from the clarification of the Messenger, peace be upon him, where he said: «No cutting except in a quarter of a dinar and upwards». No cutting except in a quarter of a dinar and upwards. So whoever steals what is less than a quarter of a dinar, it is not permissible to cut his hand; it would be oppression and injustice against him if his hand were cut. This is clear. But what needs more clarification than this is that when Allah said: {Amputate their hands} [Al-Ma'idah: 38], we find the hand used sometimes referring to: the arm up to the elbows, and we find sometimes the hand used referring to: the palms only.

    "text": "When Allah Almighty said in this verse {Amputate their hands} [Al-Ma'idah: 38], what is the hand intended here? Linguistically: whether the thief's hand is cut from the wrist, or from the elbow, or from the shoulder, all of that is a hand. Whoever applies the text of this Qur'an in any of these three ways: the palm, the arm, or the hand entirely from the shoulder, linguistically: has applied the Qur'anic text: a hand, amputate their hands. But is this Sharia (Law)? The answer: No. From the application of the Messenger to this Qur'anic text, meaning: when he cut the thief's hand, he did not cut it from the shoulder, nor from the elbow, but from the wrist. From where did we know this? From the Companions, from those trustworthy transmitters. They are the ones who transmitted to us this Islam with all its details which we pointed to even with a brief word. Therefore, Imam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, may Allah have mercy on him, says in his scientific poetry:\nKnowledge is: Allah said, His Messenger said ... The Companions said; it is not by camouflage.\nKnowledge is not your setting up disagreement foolishly ... Between the Messenger and the opinion of a jurist.\nNay, nor denying the Attributes and negating them ... wary of stripping (Ta'til) and likening (Tashbih).\nSo what is knowledge? Allah said, the Messenger of Allah said, the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said. This is what I wanted to emphasize to your hearing, repeating it always with the Book and the Sunnah: The Companions. Up to now, few people pay attention to this addition which our Lord pointed to in the previous verse: {and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115]. For the way of the believers in our example—the examples are many and very many—in our example, the way of the believers is: cutting the hand of the thief from the wrist, and not from the elbow, nor from the shoulder. Whoever does contrary to this has opposed the Messenger and followed other than the way of the believers.

We see these scholars whom the questioner refers to, firstly: Did they say: Allah said, the Messenger of Allah said? Leave aside the third addition which is essential, did they say: Allah said, the Messenger of Allah said? The answer: No; because the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, who undertook the clarification of the Qur'an, said the opposite of what those mentioned in the question say: that they are scholars. What did Allah say? He Almighty said: {And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression} [Al-Ma'idah: 2]. So who doubts—I do not say: who among the people of knowledge doubts? Rather, I do not say: who among the students of knowledge doubts? Rather, is there a Muslim with a mind who doubts that he who works as an employee in the bank helps the bank consume people's money unjustly, and consume what Allah has forbidden? I do not think anyone doubts this fact, otherwise, he would not have the ability to understand the meaning of: {but do not cooperate in sin and aggression} [Al-Ma'idah: 2]. Cooperating in sin is different from committing sin directly. This is a scientific fact known, I do not say by people of knowledge, but by beginner students of knowledge. Here is now for you the clarification of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, related to such a verse: {but do not cooperate in sin and aggression} [Al-Ma'idah: 2]. Consuming usury (Riba) is undoubtedly among the major sins according to any Muslim whatsoever. And that drinking wine or being addicted to it is among the prohibitions; even if he does not drink wine, it is likewise. Do you think if there was no cooperation in evil, would you have been able to find a usurer consuming people's money by way of Riba? No. Would you find a wine drinker if there were no cooperators in evil? The answer: No. And the evidence from the Sunnah explaining the Qur'an: «Allah cursed ten regarding wine».

Then he conjoined with that the rest of the ten. He said: «its server, the one who asks for it to be served, its presser, the one who asks for it to be pressed, its seller, its drinker, its carrier, and the one to whom it is carried». All these did not drink wine, but they are the cause for the existence of the wine drinker. If, for example, the grape seller did not exist, it would not be pressed into wine, and wine would not exist in the world. Therefore: {but do not cooperate in sin and aggression} [Al-Ma'idah: 2]. Legally cursed is the one who does not drink wine as long as he aids the wine drinker, meaning he prepares the causes for him to be able to drink wine. This is a hadith agreed upon by Muslim scholars as authentic, and it has come from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, through numerous authentic routes. The second hadith, which is at the core of the subject: «Allah cursed the consumer of Riba (usury), its payer, its scribe, and its two witnesses». So can a scholar be imagined saying: There is no harm for a Muslim to be an employee in a usurious bank, writing Riba, while the Messenger of Allah says: «Allah cursed the consumer of Riba, its payer, its scribe, and its two witnesses»? This is not a scholar. He might be a scholar in the sense of: {O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do? * Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do} [As-Saff: 2-3]. I do not imagine a man truly believing in Allah, and truly knowledgeable of the Book and Sunnah, who yet says and issues that unjust fatwa: that it is permissible for a Muslim to be an employee in a bank. Now we have posed the following question repeatedly and the answer was one by consensus. I do not say now these employees, but I say: these foolish ones who are not workers in the bank, but they deposited their money in the bank. If they all agreed to",

Those who feed [it]. They might say we deposit and place our money in the bank to protect it, and we do not consume Riba (usury), thinking that they are doing good work. Nay, and nay again. By the evidence that if they withdrew these funds, the banks would go bankrupt. Therefore, those who deposit their money in banks are the cause of the existence of the consumers of Riba. Thus, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, spoke the truth when he said: «Allah cursed the consumer of Riba and its payer». So if the one outside the bank is cursed legally because he is the cause of the existence of this bank, then we move to the image directly related to the question: These people dealing with banks still deposit their money in banks. If we assume that these employees in the bank repented and turned to Allah Almighty—I do not say when they heard the fatwa of the Sheikh contrary to the fatwa of that scholar, but I say: when they heard the hadith of the Messenger, peace be upon him. First: The hadith related to them: «Allah cursed the consumer of Riba, its payer, its scribe, and its two witnesses». Then the hadith: «Ten are cursed regarding wine». They heard these two hadiths and turned [to Allah] and repented and withdrew. What happens to the bank? It will undoubtedly become disabled.

This is in reality a long, very long discussion. But it suffices me now that I reminded the questioner directly and those present that the one who issues a fatwa: that it is permissible for a Muslim to be an employee in the bank, and the bank deals in Riba, that this is ignorance or ignoring the Qur'anic verse: {but do not cooperate in sin and aggression} [Al-Ma'idah: 2].

I wanted to conclude the answer with this, then a hadith came to my mind which I wished not to prolong the speech by mentioning it as well, were it not that I know that most Muslims are also heedless. They are heedless of the connection of this hadith to the previous verse: {but do not cooperate in sin and aggression} [Al-Ma'idah: 2]. This is from one side. Then they violate it in themselves or their relatives, in their family. I mean by that his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: «Allah cursed the Namisat (pluckers of eyebrows) and the Mutanammisat (those who ask to have their eyebrows plucked)». The Mutanammisat: let's say it in the image expression: the plucked ones, meaning the woman plucks, for example, her eyebrows. But she cannot pluck her eyebrows [herself], there is a plucker, there is a plucker. This one who plucks her eyebrow for her, what is she doing? Were it not for her, there would be no plucked woman. So you see that this example is complementary or from the completion of the very many examples that explain: {but do not cooperate in sin and aggression} [Al-Ma'idah: 2] .. «Allah cursed the Namisat» meaning: the beauticians,",

    "text": "Let us say the word about these Namisat and Mutanammisat, meaning: the customer. «And the Washimat (tattooers), the Mustawshimat (those asking to be tattooed)». The tattooer is known. You find not only women but men also. You find this animal which is the image of a human drawing on his veins and on his skin which Allah created perfectly, making him a well-proportioned human; depicted in the image of a lion, carrying a sword with what, tattooing. So who depicted this? The tattooer (Washim). So he is a Mustawshim: meaning asking for the tattoo from another. Were it not for the tattooer, there would be no tattooed person. So look at how the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, wants to make the Islamic society a society cooperating in righteousness, refraining from evil: «Allah cursed the Namisat, the Mutanammisat, the Washimat, the Mustawshimat, and the Falijat, the Mutafallijat (those who file teeth for beauty)». This we haven't seen, and we hope not to see it, but we are seeing what is worse than it. It seems that in the past, Satan beautified for some women to change the beautiful, handsome creation of Allah. For as you know, Allah Almighty created in the mouth of every human teeth like set pearls. But Allah's creation does not please her, so she goes to the Falijah. The Falijah, meaning: beautician, barber, takes a fine file and widens between the tooth and the tooth; so it pleases her that the tooth appears from her teeth far from the sides of the two surrounding teeth; so it pleases her that a canine appears for her like the canine of a dog, for example. This is better to her than her teeth being as Allah Almighty created them. This is Al-Falj (filing/spacing), and those are the Falijat and Mutafallijat. Why did he denounce these two types [the actor and the receiver] involved in the evil and the one causing the evil? Because they cooperated in evil specifically in these traits mentioned here. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said at the end of the hadith: «Those who change Allah's creation for beauty». In truth, brothers, if the Islamic society walked by this verse only: {but do not cooperate in sin and aggression} [Al-Ma'idah: 2], we would be as our first fathers were, living in glory and majesty, feared by enemies from a month's distance.",

So I say: For a Muslim to be truly upon the Book and the Sunnah, and not be among those deviant sects which the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, referred to in the authentic hadith which the authors of the Sunan, Imam Ahmad, and others narrated with various chains of transmission and similar wordings, which is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: «The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians split into seventy-two sects, and my nation will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one. They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: It is what I and my companions are upon». His saying, peace and blessings be upon him, in this authentic hadith: «What I and my companions are upon», contains very clear evidence that it is not sufficient for a Muslim to merely attribute himself to the Book and the Sunnah only. Rather, he must add to that following what the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were upon; because they are the ones who received the clarification of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, of the Qur'an—a sufficient clarification via the three methods known to the people of knowledge, by which I mean his speech, peace be upon him, his action, and his approval. These three methods are what clarify the Speech of Allah Almighty, regarding which Allah Blessed and Exalted ordered His Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, to clarify the Qur'an, as in His Almighty's saying: {[We sent them] with clear proofs and written ordinances. And We revealed to you the message [Reminder] that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl: 44]. So his clarification, peace be upon him, is upon these three attributes: speech, action, and approval. And there is no way for the likes of us, especially in this time, to know what he, peace be upon him, said, did, or approved—and all of that, as I mentioned earlier, is a clarification of the Qur'an—there is no way for us to know that except through the path of the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. For they are the ones who initially transmitted his speech, action, and approval. For this reason, a Muslim is not from the Saved Sect if he restricts himself to his understanding of the Qur'an and the Hadith of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, only; rather, he must add to that the understanding of the Companions of his speech, peace be upon him, his action, and his approval.

However, what I want to remind [you] of in this blessed hour, Allah willing, is the clarification of the difference between the Saved Sect and the other deviant sects, even those among them that are still within the circle of Islam but have strayed from some of Islam, much or little. Our Lord is the One who knows it, knows him, and judges by it: {The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children * But only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart} [Ash-Shu'ara: 89]. The difference between the Saved Sect and all those sects is that the Saved Sect refuses to understand Islam, the Qur'an, and the Sunnah through the opinion of so-and-so (Fulan wa 'Allan), no matter how great his status is among Muslims, except through the path of the Messenger, peace be upon him, first, then through the path of his companions, peace and blessings be upon him, thirdly [sic - meant secondly/thirdly in sequence]. Because the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, when asked about the Saved Sect, did not say: \"What I am upon\" [only], but rather he conjoined to that his saying: «and my companions». This means: that the Muslim scholar truly, just as he is keen to know what the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, was upon of guidance and light in speech, action, and approval, he is also keen to know what his companions, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were upon regarding good following of their Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. This Saved Sect, this is its merit over the other sects, and this is very apparent in this time, as I will clarify shortly, Allah Blessed and Exalted willing. But before that, I want to remind our listening brothers of a verse in the Noble Qur'an. This verse is considered the text from which the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, launched, or from which he quoted his previous saying: «What I and my companions are upon». I mean the saying of Allah Blessed and Exalted: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115], He said: {and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisa: 115]. So the saying of our Lord Blessed and Exalted in this verse: {and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115] is what he, peace be upon him, clarified in the previous hadith when he said: «and my companions».",

Therefore, a Muslim is not from the Saved Sect unless he adopts this Salafi methodology in following the Book and the Sunnah and what the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, were upon. This is the clear distinguishing factor in every era and every land between the People of Sunnah (Ahl al-Sunnah) truly, and those deviant sects that attribute themselves to the Book and the Sunnah but refuse to attribute themselves to the Righteous Predecessors (As-Salaf As-Salih). Even those who are from the People of Sunnah truly, like the followers of the four Madhhabs—regardless of the deviant sects that declare some of the Righteous Predecessors from the Companions as misguided, like the Rawafid (Rejectionists) and the Khawarij and their likes; we do not mean them now. Rather, we mean the People of Sunnah who meet with us in honoring and glorifying the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family; we do not differentiate between them nor hate anyone of them. Rather, we revere them for their companionship to their Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, while maintaining the levels of preference among them, by precedence in companionship, or by knowledge, or by precedence in Jihad and precedence to Islam, and so on. But the People of Sunnah all meet on being pleased with the Companions of, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, all of them together. What I want to say is: Many of the People of Sunnah who meet with us in being pleased with the Companions have forgotten that it is very necessary that we understand the Book and the Sunnah according to what these Companions were upon; because they were closer in era to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, than those who came after them. For this reason, a Muslim is not upon guidance and light, nay, he is not holding fast to the guidance of the Messenger which he commanded to hold fast to in his sermons always and forever, unless he knows what the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were upon. This knowledge opens for the one who knows it a door of knowledge that cannot be entered or accessed by one who is far from submitting to this restriction and condition, which is following what the Righteous Predecessors were upon.

This general text cannot be applied correctly unless we know what the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were upon regarding acts of worship; because knowing that a certain matter is an innovation in Islam cannot be known unless we know what our Righteous Predecessors were upon. For the sayer's statement: \"This is an innovation,\" only means that it did not exist in the era of the Messenger, peace be upon him, nor in the era of the Companions, and consequently did not exist in the era of the rest of the generations witnessed for with goodness. Thus: knowing what the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were upon is what enables us to stand by his saying, peace be upon him: «Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire». Therefore, the methodology of one who attributes himself to the Salaf differs from the methodology of one who attributes himself only to the Qur'an and the Sunnah, and interprets it or them as his sheikh or his madhhab interprets, without returning in that to what the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, his companions, and those who followed them in goodness were upon. Therefore: We should not be deceived today by calls that all meet on the saying: that we are upon the Book and the Sunnah; because the origin of the sects referred to in the Hadith of the Sects cannot say anything except that they are upon the Book and the Sunnah. If some of them were to say: \"We do not argue with the Sunnah,\" they would have apostatized from Islam; because they denied many of the verses of the Qur'an, such as His Almighty's saying: {And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from} [Al-Hashr: 7]. Therefore, we do not imagine that a sect among the Islamic sects denies the Sunnah, and this is the reality. The Khawarij say: We take the Sunnah. The Shia say: We take the Sunnah. But the Sunnah they take is not according to the way the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were upon, and their followers from the Successors and their followers.

    "text": "always and forever upon the saying: that holding fast to the Book and the Sunnah is not a correct holding fast unless it is accompanied by following what the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were upon. Here, I must strike an example that clarifies to us the importance of returning, in understanding the Book and the Sunnah, to what the Righteous Predecessors were upon, from what they transmitted from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, in speech, action, and approval. We take, for example, His Blessed and Exalted's saying: {[As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands} [Al-Ma'idah: 38]. Here are two general, comprehensive texts. First: the noun \"thief\" (Al-Sariq), and the other: \"the hand\" (Al-Yad). His saying: {The thief} [Al-Ma'idah: 38] includes every thief, even one who steals an egg, a chicken's egg, or a chicken, or the like of what has no value. This, linguistically, is called a thief. However, the verbal clarification of, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, is what prevents us from interpreting this word in this verse upon its absoluteness and comprehensiveness. It prevents us from saying: Every thief, no matter the value of the stolen item, his hand is cut. We say: No, this is not permissible, this contradicts the Qur'an; because Allah says: {[We sent them] with clear proofs and written ordinances. And We revealed to you the message [Reminder] that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl: 44]. And he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, clarified the thief mentioned in this verse by his saying: «No cutting except in a quarter of a dinar and upwards». Thus: when we read this verse: {The thief} [Al-Ma'idah: 38], we should understand this word in the light of his saying, peace be upon him. {Amputate their hands} [Al-Ma'idah: 38], here \"the hands\" (Al-Aydi), as you know, is the plural of hand (Yad). The hand is used referring to the palm, as came in the hadith of Tayammum: «That you strike the face of the earth with your palms». And it is used referring to the arm as it is in the hadith of the verse of Ablution in the verse of Ablution. And it is used referring to the whole hand from the shoulder to the fingers. So I wonder, whoever took the generality of the verse: {Amputate their hands} [Al-Ma'idah: 38] and applied the Qur'anic text upon this absolute sense, would he be a follower of the Noble Qur'an? The Answer: It is clear from the previous comment regarding the thief, no; because he opposed the clarification of, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family. But the clarification here was from him, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, a practical, action-based clarification, where the hand of",

The verses mentioned in the Qur'an as absolute or general are many, very many. It pleases me to suggest to some students of knowledge to collect these absolute or general verses in the Noble Qur'an and clarify what entered them of restriction or specification by what came in the Sunnah, and in the authentic Sunnah; to show the people that there is no room for understanding the Qur'an without the Sunnah of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and without the clarification of his companions, peace and blessings be upon him, of what the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, was upon. I said earlier: The absolute or general verses are many, very many. Take for example the verses that order Zakah, order Prayer, and order Hajj. They cannot be understood except in the light of the Book and the Sunnah. From here, the exit of the sect called today the \"Quranists\" (Al-Qur'aniyyun) from the circle of Islam and Muslims becomes clear to us, when they said: We are in no need of understanding the Qur'an through the Sunnah. That is due to what I pointed to earlier of the clarification that whoever does not take the Sunnah does not take the Qur'an; because the Qur'an ordered Muslims in more than one verse to seek judgment from Allah and His Messenger, as is known in the well-known verse: {And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day} [An-Nisa: 59]. The research in this is long, very long. I only intended in it to alert to the necessity of every Muslim who is jealous for being of the Saved Sect to pay attention, that he should not be content for himself or for others to say: I am a follower of the Book and the Sunnah, nothing more. He must couple with these two fundamental sources that we know what the Companions of the Messenger, peace be upon him, were upon regarding guidance and light. Thereby, we realize the attribute of the Saved Sect, which is that we be upon what the Messenger of Allah and his companions were upon. This, as I said earlier, is a wide door. But I must bring a new constraint due to the negligence of many Islamic callers regarding it, which is caring for knowing what is authentic of the Sunnah and what is not authentic",

Therefore, a group of Muslim scholars must care with special care for what is known among scholars as the Science of Hadith, Hadith Terminology, and the Science of Disparagement and Praise (Jarh wa Ta'dil), so they can purify the Sunnah from what entered it over the ages and eras of weak and fabricated hadiths which entered the bellies of many books of Tafsir, Hadith, and Fiqh, let alone books of admonitions, heart-softeners (Raqa'iq), and stories. Therefore: A group of Muslim scholars must care with special care for the Science of Sunnah so they can thereby interpret the Qur'an correctly. After this, I say: You know, O brothers, that correct knowledge is a means to act upon it. So a student of knowledge should not adorn himself with knowledge only without coupling this knowledge with action. Therefore, we always pray that Allah Almighty inspires us with beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds: {And say, \"Work, for Allah will see your work and [so will] His Messenger and the believers. And you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you of what you used to do.\"} [At-Tawbah: 105]. This is what was easy for me regarding the word requested by the virtuous Sheikh, Sheikh Abdullah. And we ask Allah Almighty to inspire us with our guidance and grant us all success to what He loves and is pleased with. Intervention: May Allah thank you, virtuous Sheikh. The Sheikh: You are welcome. (Al-Huda wan-Noor /805/ 13: 01: 00)",

Intervention: What is the reply to the one who says: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers} [An-Nisa: 115], he said: The way of the believers is the Book and the Sunnah... The Sheikh: This is what I pointed to earlier... The matter returns to the fact that there is no difference between the reality of the verse and if it were: {And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him, We will give him what he has taken}. This is certainly—Divine Speech is far exalted above having attributed to it [redundancy]—there is not a word in the Qur'an, let alone a sentence like this: {and follows other than the way of the believers}, except that it was placed for a purpose and a very great goal. And this is among the interpretations that do not end, and let us call it by the correct name, among the negation (Ta'til) with which the negators of Attributes are described. Then what do they say if some Companions did an action? And look now how the misguidance of these people spreads from numerous and very, very many sides. What do they say if there comes from some Companions a saying, action, or fatwa that does not contradict the Book and the Sunnah? Do they take it, or do they say: We are men and they are men?! What do you think of them? Intervention: They do not say \"we are men and they are men,\" but they say out of politeness: That the understanding we understood is the required understanding, and the understanding you compel us with is your understanding which you only compel yourself with...

Do they adopt this action or this fatwa, or do they say: We are men and they are men? Intervention: No, they say: Our reality or the state of sin that is in our hands, and the saying we see in our hands is not as the early Predecessors of the nation imagined... The Sheikh: Allah is Great! Intervention: Yes. The Sheikh: Meaning: They prioritize their understanding over the understanding of those [Predecessors]. Intervention: Yes. The Sheikh: And what is the meaning of: «What I and my companions are upon»? Also but... Intervention: Sheikh Safar visited us and said: The society that was in the time of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, were believing Companions with much faith, like a sea; if one of them erred, even if he didn't intend to, this does not affect the sea. Whereas those below them might speak or act while having little water—likening faith to water—if a drop of impurity dropped in it, it would pollute it and make it impure and unfit for purification or cooking... The Sheikh: Beautiful poetic speech, but it is an evasion of the answer. I repeat the question to you: I am not asking about the difference between the error of the first ones and the later ones so that this answer comes with this beautiful poetic speech. Rather, I ask: If some Companions—some—did an action or issued a fatwa, and there is nothing in the Book and the Sunnah contradicting them, do we prioritize our understanding over their understanding, or do we concede our understanding for their understanding; because they are purer in hearts, more abundant in knowledge, and... and to the end of what is there of very well-known attributes.",

    "text": "Intervention: Yes. The Sheikh: Now I give an example from the practical side such that it cannot be said about them or narrated about them: that they show politeness verbally. I ask now: What do they do practically? There is a hadith in Sahih Muslim: «The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, forbade drinking while standing» and in a wording: «The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family, rebuked drinking while standing». It was said to the narrator of the hadith, Anas bin Malik, the servant of the Messenger, peace be upon him, as is known: \"What about eating?\" He said: \"It is worse (Sharr).\" We now, who prioritize the understanding of the Companion over our understanding, especially since we do not find in the Sunnah, let alone the Qur'an, what opposes this answer from this noble Companion Anas bin Malik, we practically do not differentiate between drinking standing and eating standing. Just as we do not drink standing but sitting, likewise we do not eat standing but sitting. What do they do? Intervention: I think in these rulings they are followers, tracking the path of the Predecessors. The Sheikh: I do not think so; because they argue at that time. And I hope that your narration here is a correct narration and not out of assuming good thoughts. I hope this narration about them is a narration matching their reality; because we then, from here... from this partial point, establish the proof against them. Why did you now follow the Predecessors in this partial point? You are indebted and tasked to follow the Predecessors in what is much more important than this partial point, especially regarding Creed (Aqeedah) and more specifically regarding Takfir (Excommunication). Is this clear, Allah willing... Intervention: There remains... a point only, a word to support the speech of our Sheikh... the issue of the understanding of the Predecessors, our Sheikh... a word of two lines by Imam Shatibi... The Sheikh: May Allah bless you. Intervention: Very wonderful. Our Sheikh says in the book *Al-Muwafaqat*, Part Three, page (77), he says: \"It is obligatory upon every looker into the Sharia evidence to observe what the first ones understood from it, and what they were upon in acting by it, for it is more worthy of correctness and more upright in knowledge and action...\" The Sheikh: Yes, by Allah... I believed in Allah and what His Messenger brought and what our Righteous Predecessors followed... Intervention: Allah is Great. Intervention: ...in the book .... transmits a phrase and attributes it to Abu Hanifa, Hammad bin Sulayman, and Rabi'ah al-Ra'yi, saying: \"They used to say: Our opinion for those after us is better for them than their opinion for themselves.\" The Sheikh: This... So what about the opinion of the Predecessors among the Companions compared to those after them, by greater reason. (Al-Huda wan-Noor /830/ 02: 48: 00)",

How is the reconciliation between it and the saying of his Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family: (May Allah make radiant a man who heard my speech [article] and comprehended it, then conveyed it as he heard it; perhaps a conveyer is more comprehending than a hearer)? How is the explanation of this hadith? The Sheikh: \"Rubba\" (Perhaps/Maybe) is for minimization (Taqlil), O brother. \"Rubba\" is for minimization. Meaning: There may come after the Companions one who understands some issues more than these few who heard the speech of the Messenger. But it does not mean that he brings something new which none of the Companions had arrived at. Did you understand the answer? The Questioner: Yes. The Sheikh: Good.
