    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. [This work is] known as 'The Unique Pearl of the Age regarding the Virtues of the Contemporaries.' I have dedicated it to the library of the Great Master, the Scholar, the Just, the Mujahid, the Supported, the Victorious, the Triumphant, Taj al-Din, Glory of Islam, Support of the People, Sword of the State, Lion of the Nation, Helper of the Mujahideen, Conqueror of Rebels, Doing Justice to the Oppressed against the Oppressors, Pride of the Chiefs, Backer of the Public, Choice of the Honored Imamate, Groom of the Exalted Caliphate, the Noble of Iraq, of Pure Roots, Support of the Muslims, Brother of Kings and Sultans, Sword of the Commander of the Faithful, Abu al-Futuh Ali bin... and may his club flourish with praise and thanksgiving. I apologize for any oversight that occurs or breach that cannot be patched. He who requires pardon accepts purity, for no one is free from fault, nor is a pen lifted from a writer.\n\nAbu Ubaidah said: The poets of the Jahiliyyah are three: Imru' al-Qays, Al-Nabigha, and Zuhayr. We will mention them and those after them with the utmost brevity and appropriate summarization, for a memorandum does not bear elaboration or boredom. I have mentioned only the rare and beautiful anecdotes and poets known only to a few notables. I began by mentioning the nicknamed poets, some of whom were nicknamed for a verse they said, others for a physical mark, a visible color, a famous deed, their city, or their kunya (surname).\n\n**Poets' Nicknames**\n\n**Chapter: Those Nicknamed for Poetry They Spoke**\n\nAmong the poets nicknamed for a verse is **Mudrij al-Rih** (The Wind-Dragger). He said:\n'Did you recognize a trace of Sumayya at Al-Liwa... The wind dragged over it after you, so it became leveled.'\nIt is narrated that when he composed half of this verse, he got stuck and remained unable to compose the second half for a year. He had buried a cache in the very dwellings where he used to stay. He remembered it and told his servant girl to go and dig up the cache from that wilderness, giving her its signs. The girl went, but the winds had shifted over those lands and erased their traces. She returned finding nothing. He asked her about the situation, and she said: 'The wind dragged over it after you, so it became leveled.' He completed his verse with this and was named Mudrij al-Rih.\n\n**Al-Muraqqish**: His name was Amr bin Sufyan (Al-Muraqqish the Younger). He was named Al-Muraqqish because his face was speckled. Or because he said: 'As a pen writes (raqasha) on the back of leather.'\n\n**Al-Mumazzaq** (The Torn): For his saying:\n'If I am to be eaten, then you be my eater... Otherwise, overtake me while I am not torn apart.'\nIt is said Uthman wrote this verse to Ali while he was besieged.\n\n**Al-Mukhariq** (The Shredder): Attributed himself to Al-Mumazzaq, saying:\n'I am the shredder of the honor of the mean, just as... Al-Mumazzaq was [shredder] of the honor of the mean, my father.'\n\n**Al-Muthaqqib** (The Piercer): His name is A'idh bin al-Ahmar. Named for his saying:\n'They showed beauties and hid others... And they pierced the face-veils for the eyes.'\nOr for his saying:\n'No litters—my longing is not for them—nor the piercing stars (Al-Thaqibat) of Lu'ayy bin Ghalib.'\n\n**Al-Nabigha al-Dhubyani**: His name is Ziyad bin Muawiyah. Named Al-Nabigha (The one who bursts forth) for his saying:\n'And she settled among Banu Qayn bin Jasr... And affairs have burst forth (nabaghat), not from them.'\nOthers said: He was named Al-Nabigha because he burst forth in poetry late in life. There are four Nabighas: Of Banu Dhubyan, Banu Ja'da (Qays bin Abdullah), Banu al-Harith (Yazid bin Aban), and Banu Shayban (Abdullah bin al-Mukhariq). They were named so because they started poetry when they were old.\n\n**Al-Khalaj**: His name is Najiya bin Malik. Named for his saying:\n'As if the pulling (takhaluj) of the ropes in it... were downpours pouring with the morning clouds.'\n\n**Shuqrah**: His name is Muawiyah bin al-Harith. Named for his saying:\n'I may carry the spear with solid knots... having on it from the blood of the people something like anemones (Al-Shuqrat).'\nAl-Shuqrat refers to the red anemones (Shaqa'iq). They were named so because Al-Nu'man built a sitting place called Al-Dahik and planted anemones there, so they were called Shaqa'iq al-Nu'man.\n\n**Al-Mufaddal**: His name is Amir bin Ma'shar. Named for his saying in his poem:\n'We made their women cry, and they made... women cry whose saliva does not flow easily (from grief).'\n\n**Al-Muqrid** (The Lender/Clipper): His name is Zahdam bin Ma'd. Named for saying:\n'And I am the lender against the sides... of the betrayers, for every neighbor.\nThe lending (clipping) of a fire-striker's flint... in all of it, fire is kindled.'",

    "text": "Among the modern poets:\n**Al-Mura'ath** (The Earring Wearer): This is Bashar bin Burd. His nickname was Al-Mura'ath, a client of Uqayl, and he was blind. He was called Al-Mura'ath for saying:\n'Who is for a gazelle with an earring (mura'ath)... enchanting in glance and look?\nHe said to me: You will not attain me... I said: Or will fate overcome?'\nIt is also said he was named Al-Mura'ath because he was born with a split earlobe, so they said he was born 'mura'athan', meaning he didn't need piercing.\n\n**Shahawat** (Desires): His name was Musa.

They call the night 'Akhdar' and water 'Akhdar'. That is why the agricultural land of Iraq was called Al-Sawad (The Black) due to the abundance and greenness of trees.\n\n**Al-Hutay'ah** (The Runt): His name is Jarwal bin Malik.
