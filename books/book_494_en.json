    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah who created creation from nothing, established it, and ordained within it the measures of His wisdom, then executed them. He exalts whom He wills by His wisdom and abases whom He wills by His justice. He is the One deserving to be worshipped and unified, sanctified and glorified. Exalted is He in His Essence and the perfection of His Attributes, and He is Unique. And I send prayers upon our Master and Prophet Muhammad, who straightened the foundations of the Sharia, clarified its paths, and paved them. May Allah's prayers be upon him and upon all the Prophets and Messengers, always supported, and upon his family and companions. As for what follows: The one in need of his Lord, Abd al-Rahman bin Hamad bin Zaid al-Mughayri al-Lami, Ta'i by lineage, Hanbali by school, and Najdi by homeland, says: Some brothers asked me to collect a summary on lineage that includes the origins of the Arabs. I was not of the people of that field, but I was compelled to do so by people's lack of desire for this art, which was the habit of the Arabs before us. Allah Almighty said: (O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you). Some commentators said: 'Peoples' (Shu'ub) refers to non-Arabs, and 'Tribes' (Qaba'il) refers to Arabs. It came in the Hadith: \"Allah Almighty says on the Day of Resurrection: All lineage is severed except My lineage, which is Piety.\" And it came in the Hadith: \"Learn from your lineages what enables you to know your kin, and join your ties of kinship with it.\" And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"If you conquer Egypt, treat the Copts well, for they have dhimma (protection) and kinship.\" Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Learn lineage, and do not be like the Nabataeans of the Sawad (rural Iraq); if one of them is asked about his origin, he says: 'From such and such village.'\" Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, was a genealogist, as was Sa'id bin al-Musayyib. Some wits said: \"If you see a man hating the science of lineage, know that his lineage is mixed with non-Arabs.\" I selected this copy from books of lineage and history, such as Qala'id al-Juman by Al-Suyuti, Saba'ik al-Dhahab by Al-Suwaydi, Wasaya al-Muluk (Wills of the Kings), Al-Iqd al-Farid, and the History of Ibn al-Athir. I named it: \"The Selected Book in Mentioning the Lineage of Arab Tribes.\" I also took from trustworthy men from the Bedouins and city dwellers present today. For as is observed among the Arabs, one of them might be in a tribe but attributes himself to another. The reason was the mixing of some with others through alliance and intermarriage, and the protection of some by others; thus they mixed. Yet, they preserved their merits and lineages; no one is called by other than his father, nor attributes himself except to his tribe in any state or place. There were among them those who attributed themselves to Qahtan, and the Adnanite to Adnan. The beginning of mankind is Adam, peace be upon him, the Father of Mankind. Ibn al-Jawzi and others said: Adam lived a thousand years after descending to earth, and it is said he lived longer. It is mentioned that Eve bore him forty sets of twins, in each womb a male and a female, and they all perished except the lineage of Seth. Ibn Jarir said in his history: Eve bore him forty children, and it is said one hundred and twenty. Between the death of Adam, peace be upon him, and the birth of Noah, peace be upon him, were ten generations, and it is said more. Noah is the son of Lamech bin Methuselah bin Enoch (Idris) bin Jared bin Mahalalel bin Cainan bin Enos bin Seth bin Adam. It is said in Al-Iqd al-Farid: Noah the Prophet, peace be upon him, is the Second Father of Mankind, upon him be blessings and peace, because those before him from the children of Adam did not have surviving lineage after the drowning in the Flood. The survivors are from the lineage of Noah. Allah Almighty said: (And We made his descendants those remaining). Noah had several children: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The children of Shem: The Arabs, Persians, and Romans. The children of Ham: The Sudan (Blacks), Berbers, and Copts. The children of Japheth: The Turks, Slavs, and Gog and Magog. Ibn al-Athir mentioned in his history the descendants of Noah, peace be upon him. Wahb bin Munabbih said: Shem bin Noah is the father of the Arabs, Persians, and Romans. Ham bin Noah is the father of the Sudan. Japheth bin Noah is the father of the Turks and Gog and Magog. It is said the Copts are from the children of Qut bin Ham. He said the wife of Shem bin Noah was Salib, daughter of Batawil bin Mahul bin Enoch bin Cain bin Adam. He said: As for Japheth, he had children: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. From the children of Gomer are the kings of Persia in one saying. From the children of Tiras are the Turks and Khazars. From the children of Meshech are the Spanish (Ashban). From the children of Magog are Gog and Magog. From the children of Javan are the Slavs and Burjan (Bulgars).",

    "text": "He said: Japheth begot the Romans, who are the Banu al-Nazar bin Yunan bin Japheth. As for Ham bin Noah, among his children are Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. From the children of Cush is Nimrod bin Cush; it is also said Nimrod is from the children of Shem. The rest of Ham's children are the Nubians, Abyssinians, and Zanj. It is said that Mizraim's children are the Copts, the people of Fayoum, and the Berbers. They are two groups: a group of Arabs and a group of this lineage. As for Phut, he traveled to India and Sindh and settled there; their people are his descendants. As for Canaan, from his descendants are Sindh and India, and some of them joined Al-Sham (the Levant); the Children of Israel fought them and expelled them from Al-Sham. As for Shem bin Noah, he had children: Elam, Arphaxad, Aram, and Ashur. From the children of Elam: Persians and Jurjan (Gog and Magog?) and Imliq (Amalek), who is the father of the Amalekites, from whom are the tyrants of Al-Sham called the Canaanites, and from them are the Pharaohs of Egypt. As for Aram bin Shem bin Noah, from his children are Thamud, the people of Salih. Their dwellings were in Yemen with their brothers Banu 'Ad bin Aram. They moved from Yemen after Banu Ya'rub bin Qahtan overcame them, so they settled in Al-Hijr; they are the people of Salih, counted among the Bedouin Arabs. As for their brothers Banu 'Ad bin Aram bin Shem bin Noah, discussion of them will come, God willing, when mentioning the classes of Arabs. As for Nabit, he is from the children of Nabat bin Mash bin Aram bin Shem bin Noah. The Persians are from the children of Tiras bin Masur bin Shem bin Noah. As for Arphaxad bin Shem, Salah (Shalikh) was born to him, and to Salah was born Eber ('Abir), who is the \"Father of the Hebrews\". To Eber was born Peleg (Falikh), meaning the divider, because the earth was divided in his time. To Peleg bin Eber was born Reu (Arghwa), to Reu was born Serug (Sarugh), to Serug was born Nahor (Fakhur), and to Nahor was born Terah (Tarikh), whose name in Arabic is Azar. To Azar was born Abraham (Ibrahim), peace be upon him. To Abraham was born Isaac (Ishaq), and to Isaac was born Jacob (Ya'qub), who is \"Israel\"; from him are all the Prophets of the Children of Israel and their kings. To Abraham was born Ishmael (Isma'il), who is the Sacrificed One (Al-Dhabih) in some opinions. From Ishmael come the Adnanite Arabs, and discussion of them will come when mentioning the classes of Arabs. To Eber bin Salah bin Arphaxad bin Shem bin Noah was born Qahtan bin Hud bin Eber. They used as evidence the saying of the Qahtani poet: 'Our father is the Prophet of Allah, Hud bin Eber... So we are the children of Hud, the Purified Prophet.' Some say, quoting Al-Masudi and Al-Tabari: He is Qahtan bin Hud bin Abdullah bin Rabah bin Al-Khulud bin 'Ad. In the Book of Al-Bad' by Ibn Habib: Hud bin Abdullah bin Rabah bin Harb bin 'Ad. They used as evidence for this the Almighty's saying: (And to 'Ad [We sent] their brother Hud) to the end of the verse. Some commentators said: He is their brother in lineage. They also used as evidence the saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him: \"All the Prophets are non-Arabs ('Ajam) except four: Hud, Salih, Shu'ayb, and your Prophet, O Abu Dharr.\" The correct view is that Qahtan is the son of the Prophet Hud, peace be upon him. Section: On Mentioning the Classes of Arabs. They are three classes. Their lands and homelands are the Arabian Peninsula, located in the southwest of Asia. It is surrounded by the Red Sea and the Wilderness of Tih (Sinai) connected to the Suez Canal from its west, the Persian Gulf from its east, the Sea of Oman which is part of the Indian Ocean from its south, and the deserts extending between the Levant and the Euphrates from its north. It is eight sections: Section One: Hijaz: Located southeast of Mount Sinai on the coast of the Red Sea. It is called Hijaz because it is a barrier (Hajiz) between Tihama and Najd. Section Two: Yemen: Located south of Hijaz, and to its north is the land of Asir. Section Three: Hadhramaut: East of Yemen. Section Four: The Province of Mahra: East of Hadhramaut. Section Five: Oman: Connected to the Persian Gulf from the north and south, and the Indian Ocean from the east. Section Six: Al-Ahsa: The islands of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf, extending on its coast to the Euphrates River. Section Seven: Najd: Its lands are elevated. It is in the center of the Peninsula between Hijaz, Al-Ahsa, the deserts of Al-Sham, and the province of Al-Yamamah. It connects to Al-Sham in the north, Iraq in the east, Hijaz in the west, and Al-Yamamah in the south. Its land is the best in the land of the Arabs. Section Eight: The Province of Al-Ahqaf: A low land in the country of the Arabs on the western side of the land of Oman. Al-Yamamah is counted in this section. Section: The First Category of Arab Classes, the Extinct Arabs (Al-Arab Al-Aribah / Al-Ba'idah).",

    "text": "First: Called Al-Ba'idah (The Perished). They are the pure first Arabs. Detailed news of them has been lost to us due to the passage of time. They were many peoples and tribes, descendants of Aram bin Shem bin Noah. They are nine tribes: 'Ad, Thamud, Amim, Abil, Tasm, Jadis, Imliq (Amalek), Jurhum the First, and Wabar. The seat of their kings was Sana'a, and they ruled Al-Sham and Hijaz. Tasm and Jadis ruled Al-Yamamah among them. Al-Yamamah was called Jaww in their time. Al-Yamamah was named after the woman who could see a distance of three days journey, called Zarqa' Al-Yamamah. When Hassan bin Tubba' killed them, he killed the woman. The story of this invasion is famous in history books. This nation is the oldest of nations after the people of Noah, the greatest in power, and the most intense in strength and impact on the earth. The Second Category of Arab Classes are the Arabized Arabs (Al-Arab Al-Ariba), and some call them Al-Muta'arriba. They are from the children of Qahtan bin Hud bin Eber. Their dwellings were in Hijaz. They were contemporaries of their brothers, the people of the First Class, allied with them and supporting them. They remained gathered in the desert, far from the kingship that their brothers the First Ariba had, until their virtues branched out in the earth, and their clans and tribes multiplied. They crowded their contemporaries, the sons of the First Class, seized the opportunity of the decay of their state, and wrestled it from them. Qahtan bin Hud bin Eber was the first to settle in Yemen and overcame 'Ad and the Amalekites there. This class of Arabs (the First) perished, and the last two classes remained: the Qahtanite and the Adnanite. The existing Arabs are from these two origins. Section: On Mentioning Qahtan. The book 'Wills of the Kings' mentions that Qahtan bin Hud, peace be upon him, bin Eber bin Salah bin Arphaxad bin Shem bin Noah, peace be upon him - and the scholars have agreed that he (Hud) is a messenger prophet sent by Allah Almighty after Noah, peace be upon him, as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and trustworthy with His revelation and message. He is the one about whom the Qahtani poet says: 'Our father is the Prophet of Allah, Hud bin Eber... So we are the children of Hud, the Purified Prophet.' They mentioned that Hud, peace be upon him, advised his sons, saying to them: \"I advise you to fear Allah and obey Him, and to acknowledge His Oneness. I warn you against the world, for it is deceptive, not lasting for you, nor will you remain upon it. So fear Allah to Whom you will be gathered. And let not Satan deceive you, for he is a clear enemy to you.\" Then he turned to his people, advising them with what he advised his sons and admonishing them with what Allah Blessed and Exalted related about him: (And to 'Ad [We sent] their brother Hud) to the end of the verse. Their response to him was (O Hud, you have not brought us clear evidence) to the end of the verse. Then Qahtan, after his father, settled in Yemen and ruled it. It is said: He was the first to wear a crown and the first to be greeted with \"Abayta al-La'n\" (May you refuse the curse). They mentioned that Qahtan advised his sons - and he had children: Ya'rub, Jurhum, Oman, Hadhramaut, and Al-Harith as mentioned by Al-Bayhaqi. It is said he had ten children. He said to them: \"You are not ignorant of what befell 'Ad to the exclusion of others when they were insolent towards their Lord, took gods to worship besides Allah, and disobeyed the command of their Prophet Hud, who is your father who taught you guidance and made known to you the straight path. Whatever blessing you have is from Allah. I advise you to be good to kin. Beware of envy, for it is a caller to severance. Your brother Ya'rub is my successor among you, so listen to him and obey. Preserve my testament, act upon it, and be steadfast upon it.\" Then Ya'rub bin Qahtan preserved his father's testament and remained steadfast upon it. He is the greatest king of the Arabs over Yemen, and the first whose people greeted him with the royal greeting. Ibn Sa'id said: He is the one who possessed the lands of Yemen and overcame the people of 'Ad there. He overcame the Amalekites in Hijaz. 'Ad bin Qahtan [ruled] over Al-Hijr, Hadhramaut bin Qahtan over the land of Hadhramaut, and Oman bin Qahtan over the land of Oman. Ibn Hazm said: From the children of Al-Harith bin Qahtan are Al-Aswur; they are the group of Hanzala bin Safwan bin Al-Rass. Al-Rass is between Najran and Yemen, and Hadhramaut to Al-Yamamah, mentioned in Al-Ibar. They mentioned that Ya'rub was the first to speak the broad Arabic language, and spoke its most eloquent, rhetorical, and concise form. Arabic is attributed to him, derived from his name. He is the one whom Hassan bin Thabit Al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him, mentioned in poetry elsewhere.",

    "text": "Then Ya'rub bin Qahtan gathered his sons and advised them, saying: \"O my sons, memorize from me ten qualities that will be a remembrance and a treasure for you. O my sons, learn knowledge and adorn yourselves with it. Leave envy aside and do not turn to it, for it is a caller to severance among you. Avoid evil and its people, for evil brings evil people to you. Be fair to people from yourselves so they may be fair to you. Beware of pride, for it distances people's hearts from you. Adhere to humility, for it draws you near to people and makes you beloved to them. Forgive the wrongdoer, for forgiving the wrongdoer cuts off enmity and increases suzerainty (Siyah). Suzerainty with virtue is abundant virtue. The prestige entering upon yourselves, its beauty is your beauty. If the condition of one of you worsens, it is better for him to improve the condition of his neighbor. People only miss the one who is followed. Support the clients (Mawali), for they are your clients in war and peace, and their right upon you is like the right of one of you upon the rest. If someone consults you, advise him with what you would advise yourselves, for it is a trust placed upon your necks, and trust is as you know. Hold fast to manufacturing men (doing favors), for it is more useful that you lead others through them, and more likely to increase you in honor and pride to the end of time.\" It is mentioned that Yashjub bin Ya'rub took the Kingship after his father, and held fast to this testament unlike the rest of his brothers and clan, so he led everyone by his steadfastness on the testament and his preservation of it. Some genealogists said: I asked about the brothers of the Banu Ya'rub. It was said: The First Amalekites from the children of Aram bin Shem bin Noah, and the other group who are the inhabitants of Mecca and its surroundings from the children of Ya'rub, and their brothers Tasm and Jadis, and the tribe of Jurhum and 'Ad the Younger. Yashjub bin Ya'rub had mastery over it through loyalty from his brothers and all his clan. Then Yashjub bin Ya'rub bin Qahtan advised his sons, saying to them: \"O my sons, I did not lead my brothers and clan except by preserving the testament of my father Ya'rub bin Qahtan, by acting upon it, and by steadfastness upon it. And my father Ya'rub bin Qahtan did not lead his brothers and clan except by preserving the testament of his father. And Qahtan did not lead his brothers and clan except by preserving the testament of his father Hud, peace be upon him, preserving it, and acting upon it. So remain upon what you found me upon, for it is what honored me.\" Then he spoke poetry in which he mentioned his son Abd Shams. Abd Shams, his son, is Saba; because he was the first to take captives (Saba) and capture prisoners. He built the city of Saba and the Dam of Ma'rib. The author of Al-Tijan said: He raided the regions; it is said he toured between the East and West, striking the rebellious land until he conquered it. He built the city of Ain Shams (Heliopolis) in Egypt and appointed his son Balyun over it. Saba had several children, the most famous being Himyar and Kahlan, from whom are the two great nations. Among his sons is Masruh, mentioned in Al-Iqd Al-Farid; this Masruh will be discussed later, God willing. Ibn Hazm counted among his children Zaydan and his son Najran, after whom the land of Najran was named. Al-Suhayli added: And among his children are Wael and Malik. They mentioned that Saba held fast to the testament of his father Yashjub, preserved it, and acted upon it, so he led his brothers and clan. He was the king of all and their pillar. It is said he raided Babylon with horses and conquered it, taking its tribute. He struck with horses and men in the land, and no land was mentioned to him but he intended it and conquered it. He toured the easts and wests of the earth, and thus was named Saba. Ibn Jarir mentioned him in his exegesis: Abu Kurayb Abu Usamah told us; Al-Hasan Abu Al-Hakam told us; Abu Sabrah Al-Nakha'i told us, from Urwah bin Masik Al-Qutayni, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: \"O Messenger of Allah, tell us about Saba, is it a land or a woman?\" He (peace be upon him) said: \"It is neither a land nor a woman, but a man from the Arabs. Ten children were born to him; six went to Yemen (Tayamanu) and four went to Sham (Tasha'amu). As for those who went to Sham, they are Lakhm, Judham, Amilah, and Ghassan. As for those who went to Yemen, they include Kinda, Al-Ash'ariyun, Al-Azd, Madhhij, and Anmar.\" Genealogists, including Muhammad bin Ishaq, said: His name originally was Abd Shams bin Yashjub bin Ya'rub bin Qahtan. He was the first to give glad tidings of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in his early time. Section",

    "text": "Al-Hamdani mentioned in some of his books that Saba gathered the people of his kingdom and the notables of his household and clan. He seated his son Himyar on his right and his son Kahlan on his left. Then he said: \"O people, give me your covenants and pacts that if my right hand transgresses against my left hand, you will prevent it, or my left hand against my right hand, you will prevent it.\" So they gave him covenants and pacts on that. Then he said to them: \"I did not mean by my right and left except Himyar and Kahlan. I am not safe from them differing after me in affairs. I did not take covenants and pacts from you except that you may intervene after me between whoever of these two intends evil and dissension for his companion, or if one of them seeks more than what is apportioned to him. Himyar is older than Kahlan, and his right is to be my right hand. Kahlan is younger than Himyar, and his right is to be my left hand. The share of Himyar in my kingdom is like the share of my right hand from my body, and the share of Kahlan in my kingdom is like the share of my left hand from my body. O people, whoever is fit for the Right of the Kingdom, call him to the Right, and look at who is fit for the Left of the Kingdom and call him to the Left.\" He said: So they handed to the Right the sword, the pen, and the whip, and judged for the Right with that. They said these are three things the Right works with, and the Left does not work with them without the Right in visions. He said: Then they judged that the owner of the sword is only fit for steadfastness and standing in his position. They judged that the owner of the pen can only be a superior, pleasing administrator. They judged that the owner of the whip can only be a politician (manager). Then they judged that standing, steadfastness, unraveling and binding, administration, training, and politics belong only to the Great King stationary in the House of Kingdom and enduring enemies wherever they are. They judged that the Head repels harm, conquers wars upon meeting, and bears responsibilities. They judged that the bow reaches the opponent and adversary from a distance. Then they judged that leading the reins of horses, enduring enemies wherever they are, repelling harm and conquering upon meeting, and opposing and confronting enemies is only fit for the Owner of the State defending it, shooting from its domain, filling its gaps, undertaking its wars, and repairing and blocking the frontiers, and he is Kahlan. So Himyar assumed the Stationary Kingship in the House of Kingdom and it was handed to him, and he was named Yamin (Right) due to sitting on his father's right. Kahlan assumed the Outskirts and Frontiers, their works, wars, opposing enemies, and confronting them wherever they were. Kahlan has upon Himyar the right of aid with money and succor, and Himyar has upon Kahlan the right of obedience and sufficiency in what he assumed. Himyar and Kahlan remained upon that, as did their children after them and their children's children. Then Himyar gathered his sons. Abu Muhammad bin Hazm said he had children: \"Al-Hamisa', Malik, Zayd, Wael, Masruh, Ma'dikarib, Aws, and Murrah.\" He lived, as Al-Suhayli said, three hundred years. He was the first to be crowned with gold. He said to his sons in his testament: \"O my sons, no two people gathered, supporting and aiding each other against five scattered people, but they overcame them and possessed their captivity. No five people gathered, supporting and aiding each other against ten scattered people, but they overcame them and possessed their captivity. Any group that overcomes forty men is likely to overcome two hundred, and overcomers of two hundred are worthy to overcome a thousand. No man is obeyed by one who repays him but he is obeyed by ten. No man is obeyed by ten whom he repays but he is obeyed by a hundred. No man is obeyed by a hundred whom he repays but he is obeyed by a thousand. No man is obeyed by a thousand men but he has certainly prevailed. Whoever prevails possesses, and whoever possesses has been given the utmost of his hope in his world. O my sons: obey the most rightly guided among you, and do not disobey Al-Hamisa', for he is my successor over you and my trustee among you. He is your sword; what is the spearhead without the spear? Nay, what is the spear without the spearhead? You are by Al-Hamisa' and for him, and Al-Hamisa' is by you and for you.\" Then Al-Hamisa' bin Himyar took the Kingship after his father, preserved his testament, stood firm on it, acted upon it, and treated them as his father Himyar treated them, walking among them with his biography. Likewise, Al-Ayman bin Al-Hamisa' took the Kingship after his father Al-Hamisa' and led his brothers and clan. Then when Al-Ayman took the Kingship after his father, he walked among the people with the biography of his father and grandfather, preserving all that reached him of the testaments of their fathers and ancestors which they acted upon, advised with, and preserved for the politics of the Kingdom and maintenance of the State. Then his son Zuhayr took the Kingship after Al-Ayman. When Zuhayr took the Kingship after his father, he was one of the best kings in conduct. Then he advised his son 'Arib bin Zuhayr - and he had no other - saying to him:",

    "text": "\"O my son, the testament of your grandfather Saba bin Yashjub has reached you, and what the two separated upon on the day of testament and division—namely your grandfathers Himyar and Kahlan. So do not conduct any matter except what the two conducted from their time to this end. Advise with that whoever is fit for this matter among your children. I advise you to be steadfast on what you found me upon of justice among the subjects, overlooking the wrongdoer, distancing from harming the clan, and endearing yourself to them, for a man is nothing without his people even if he is mighty and high.\" Then 'Arib took charge after his father, stood firm on his testament, acted upon it, and treated them according to it. Then he advised his sons, who were four: Sabah, Najadah, Abraha, and Qatan. He said to them: \"O my sons, I found honor, suzerainty, might, succor, obedience, and kingship revolve around six things. O my sons, I found suzerainty is not attained except by generosity, and there is no suzerainty for one who has no generosity. I found might in numbers wherever they are, and there is no might for one who has no numbers, and no numbers for one who has no clan. I found succor in favors, and there is no succor for one who has no favors. I found obedience in justice, and there is no obedience for one who has no justice. I found kingship in manufacturing men (winning loyalty), and there is no kingship for one who does not manufacture men. O my sons: Preserve my advice and do not disobey your brother Qatan, for he is my successor over you and the guardian of the Kingdom after me.\" He said: Then Qatan took the Kingship after his father and walked among the people with his biography and the biography of his ancestors. He entrusted the Kingship in his lifetime to his son Al-Ghawth, saying to him: \"O my son, I did not entrust you with the Kingship out of desire to leave it, but I wanted to observe your conduct among the people and your politics in the Kingdom, and to know how their obedience is to you, so that I do not leave the world while I have a lump in my throat regarding your affair and the affair of the people. O my son, I advise you regarding your brothers to do for them what I did for you, to offer them your advice, and to lower your wing to them. I ask you to do with your clan what I asked you to do for your brothers, for comfort is only in the fingers, and the forearm is with the upper arm.\" Then Al-Ghawth bin Qatan held the Kingship during his father's life and after his death for a long time. He was one of the best people in conduct and the most steadfast on the traditions of his fathers and grandfathers. Then his son Wael bin Al-Ghawth took the Kingship after him. The testament of Al-Ghawth to his son Wael was this: \"O my son, the Kingdom is a house Allah Almighty built for your ancestors, so they inhabited it with justice and beneficence. Likewise, I inherited it from those before me, and likewise I bequeath it to you after me with its habitation; so inhabit it with what your ancestors inhabited it with. Know that a house is a house as long as its walls are built and its corners raised, and no breach occurs in any of its structure, for a breach is followed by another. I advise you well regarding the subjects.\" Then Wael bin Al-Ghawth bin Qatan took the Kingship after his father and managed the Kingdom with a policy praised by the people of his time. Likewise, his son Abd Shams bin Wael took the Kingship after his father and walked among the people with the biography of his ancestors and grandfathers. This Abd Shams is the grandfather of Bilqis bint Al-Hadhhad bin Sharhabil bin Amr bin Muawiyah bin Shaddad bin Qatat bin Amr bin Abd Shams. None of these but ruled what Abd Shams and his father before him ruled, and their stories are too long to explain. Amr bin Muawiyah is known as Ibn 'Allaf bin Shaddad bin Al-Maqtat. Then the Kingship transferred from these to Himyar the Younger, who is Zur'ah bin Ka'b bin Sahl bin Amr bin Qays bin Muawiyah bin Yashjub bin Abd Shams bin Wael bin Qatan bin 'Arib bin Zuhayr bin Ayman bin Al-Hamisa' bin Himyar the Elder. It is mentioned that Zur'ah's conduct among the people was good when he took the Kingship, as was his son Shaddad bin Zur'ah. Zur'ah advised his son Shaddad saying: \"O my son: If a king could dispense with people's opinions due to his own piercing opinion, superior intellect, perfect knowledge, brilliant manners, and acumen, and based on the past experiences of his ancestors which he preserved and narrated, encompassing the traditions of the ancients among his fathers and the kings of his people and the traditions of the past, I would be the person most able to dispense with sharing opinions, sharing with the Aqyal (princes), and the advice of advisors. However, a king must have a helper to aid him in opinion, commanding, and forbidding. He must have a counselor to carry some of what burdens him of that. And a son must have a testament from a father, whether the testament is little or much.\"",

    "text": "They mentioned that Shaddad bin Zur'ah - and in one copy Sadad with the un-dotted Seen, derived from rectitude (Sadad) - held the Kingship for a long time. No one from Himyar or Kahlan disobeyed him in his kingdom, which encompassed most of the earth and those in it. He walked among the people with the biography of his fathers, treated them according to the traditions of his grandfathers, preserved the testaments of the ancients among his ancestors, acted upon them, and stood firm on them until he died and the Kingship transferred to his uncle Al-Harith. Malik bin Himyar had conquered the people of Oman. His son Quda'a ruled after him, then his son Ilhaf, then his son Malik bin Ilhaf. Then war broke out between Malik and Al-Saksak bin Wael bin Himyar. Malik prevailed over Oman. After Al-Saksak, his son Ya'fur ruled, then his son Al-Nu'man succeeded him. Ya'fur is known as Al-'Arif. Maran bin Awf bin Himyar, known as Dhu Riyash, usurped authority from him; he was the ruler of Bahrain, then settled in Najran and busied himself with warring against Malik bin Ilhaf. When Al-Nu'man grew old, he imprisoned Dhu Riyash, usurped his command, and lived a long life. His son Asham ruled after him. At that point, the affairs of Himyar became disordered, and the Kingship became divided among factions (Tawa'if). Banu Kahlan used to rotate the Kingship with Banu Himyar. From the tribes of Qahtan, the Banu Zaydan bin Ya'rub bin Abyan bin Zuhayr ruled - mentioned previously - and this Abyan is the one to whom the Arabs in Yemen are attributed. Also ruling from them was Abd Shams bin Wael bin Al-Ghawth bin Hayran bin Qatan, mentioned previously, then his son Shaddad ruled after him, mentioned previously.",

    "text": "It was said he is Shaddad bin Qatan al-Matat bin Amr bin Dhi Haram bin Al-Hawar. After him his brother Luqman. Then his brothers Dhu Shadad, Yatudh, and Marathil. Some say Dhu Wael and some say Dhu Madathir; he is Al-Harith, grandfather of the Tubba' Kings. The Kingship settled in his sons after him. He was named Al-Raish (The Featherer/Enricher) because he divided the land of Yemen, its plains, mountains, and valleys among his clans and helped them cultivate it. He brought out livelihoods for them, so the people and clans prospered, and some became independent of others and of much of what they needed from what he possessed; therefore, they named him Al-Raish. His name is Al-Harith. He was the first king to invent armor for his companions and clothe them in it. Ibn Sa'id mentioned from the historians of the East, and quoted it, that Al-Harith Al-Raish was succeeded by his son Al-Sa'b, who is Dhu al-Qarnayn bin Al-Harith bin Qays bin Sayfi bin Saba the Younger bin Ka'b bin Sahl bin Amr bin Qays bin Muawiyah bin Bakr bin Jashm bin Abd Shams bin Wael bin Al-Ghawth bin Qatan bin 'Arib bin Zuhayr bin Ayman bin Al-Hamisa' bin Himyar bin Saba bin Yashjub bin Ya'rub bin Qahtan bin Hud, peace be upon him. The name of Dhu al-Qarnayn was Al-Sa'b. He took the Kingship after his father Al-Raish. He is the one whom Allah established in the earth, and he reached its easts and wests. Allah mentioned him in His Book. He marched between the two mountains (Al-Sadafayn) and built the Dam against Gog and Magog, contrary to what some scholars, historians, and linguists claim that he is Alexander the Roman. For Alexander the Greek, builder of Alexandria, did not build a dam, though he was titled Dhu al-Qarnayn; this is a grave error. By this, they confused the weak-minded and contradicted the Great Quran, [claiming] that no dam exists. It is said: The Macedonian Greek or Alexander the Roman did not build a dam; rather, the one who erected the dams is Dhu al-Qarnayn, and his name is Al-Sa'b bin Al-Raish. Mustafa Al-Ghalayini mentioned in his book saying: Tilling Alexander the Macedonian as Dhu al-Qarnayn has spread on the tongues of many people, linguists, commentators, and historians, and it is a grave error. For \"Dhu\" is a purely Arabic word; Dhu al-Qarnayn is one of the titles of the kings of Yemen. Among them were Dhu Jadan, Dhu Kila', Dhu Nuwas, Dhu Nashatir, Dhu Ru'ayn, and other titles. Dhu al-Qarnayn is the one whom Allah established in the earth, whose kingdom was great, and who built the Dam against Gog and Magog; he is Al-Sa'b bin Al-Raish. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, was asked about Dhu al-Qarnayn whom Allah mentioned in His Noble Book, and he said: \"He is from Himyar.\" This strengthens that he is Al-Sa'b and that he is other than Alexander the Macedonian, builder of Alexandria. This is Greek and that is Arab, and both ruled a great kingdom. Understand this, for it is the truth from which there is no deviation. Abu Al-Fida verified it in his history, so refer to it when mentioning the Second Class of Persian Kings. The Arabs mentioned him in their poetry, boasted of him, and counted him among the kings of their people, calling him Al-Sa'b. It is understood from most poets that the name of Dhu al-Qarnayn is Al-Sa'b among the Arabs. Mention of Dhu al-Qarnayn also occurred in much Arab poetry: in the poetry of Imru' al-Qais, Tarafa, Daws, Madhhij, and others. In the book \"Nashr al-Mahasin al-Yamaniyah\" there is much that would take too long to quote. These poems are an indication that Dhu al-Qarnayn is this one and not the Macedonian. Then his son Abraha bin Al-Sa'b Dhu al-Qarnayn, mentioned previously, ruled after him. It is mentioned that he stood firm on the testament of his father Dhu al-Qarnayn Al-Sa'b, acted upon it, and preserved it. He was the first to set up flags and build milestones and signs on the roads and watering places; therefore, he was named Dhu al-Manar (Owner of Lighthouses/Signs). They mentioned that he struck into the rebellious lands from their east to west to conquer them and take their tribute. In some books, Khurasan is the brother of Fars, and their brother is Kerman and the Elder Kuraz (?), and their father is Japheth bin Noah, peace be upon him. As for the First Romans, they are from the children of Aram bin Shem bin Noah. Their brothers are the Slavs, Khazars, Lat (?), Kabul, China, Sindh, and India. All of these were conquered by Abraha after his father Dhu al-Qarnayn Al-Sa'b. Then Abraha Dhu al-Manar advised his son Amr Dhu al-Adh'ar, saying to him: \"O my son, the Kingdom is a crop, and the King is the custodian of that crop. If the custodian excels in his care for it by watering it when needed, removing alien plants from it, and tending to it with protection from harmful beasts and birds, its harvest thrives, the custodian is praised, and the land is honored. If the custodian is otherwise, does not inspect the crop, and does not tend to it with protection and preservation, thirst weakens it, birds eat it, and beasts trample it; so neither the crop grows, nor the land is inhabited, nor the custodian is praised.\" He said: Then Amr Dhu al-Adh'ar took the Kingship after his father and went out inspecting works in the east and west of the lands. No people heard of him but they turned on their heels fearful and terrified (Madh'urin); therefore, he was named Dhu al-Adh'ar (Owner of Terrors).",

    "text": "He is the father of the first Tubba'. Al-Masudi said: He ruled for twenty-five years and raided the lands of the Maghreb. Kayqalus son of Canaan, King of Persia, marched to him. He dueled him, the armies of Kayqalus were defeated, and Dhu al-Adh'ar captured him. Then Amr Dhu al-Adh'ar advised his two sons Tubba' and Rufaydah, saying to them: \"Others are ignorant of the Kingdom, its politics, care, and welfare, and what the King needs of diplomacy, favoritism, and opposition. The Kingdom is but a millstone turning on a pivot; if another pivot is made for it, the millstone stops, does not turn, its causes are disrupted, and the hope of its people is cut off. This is so you know that the Kingdom is not suitable for two unless one is the leader and the other the follower. You have known that the crown does not fit two heads, nor do they gather in a crown ever, just as two swords do not fit in one sheath.\" He ordered his son Rufaydah to obey his brother Tubba', and this is the first of the Tubba' Kings to rule. Then Tubba' took the Kingship after his father and entrusted the Ministry to his brother Rufaydah. To Tubba' belonged what belongs to the King, and to Rufaydah what belongs to the Minister. They remained so for a long time upon their father's testament. King Tubba' walked among the people with the biography of his father Dhu al-Adh'ar, spread justice and beneficence in the land, was granted awe, and was given obedience such as no one before him was given. He said: The cities of their kings were Sana'a, and the kings from Kahlan were in Ma'rib, three stages away. In Ma'rib was the Dam built by Bilqis, a queen among their kings. It is a dam between two mountains built with rock and bitumen. She preserved the water of springs and rains with it, leaving it there according to what they needed for their irrigation. It is what is called Al-'Arim. It is said: The one who built it is Himyar, the father of the Yemeni tribes. It is said: The one who built it is Luqman bin Sinad the Elder. And it is said Saba bin Yashjub bin Ya'rub built it, which is more appropriate. He diverted seventy valleys to it and died before its completion, so the kings of Himyar completed it after him. These Tubba's, the number of their kings in successive eras and long epochs cannot be counted. They surpassed the kings of Yemen to further than them in Iraq, India, and the Maghreb. Then his son Hassan took the Kingship after Tubba'; he is Malik Karib, the second of the Tubba's. It is mentioned that he advised his son Afriqis, saying to him: \"O my son, the Kingdom is a craft, and the King is a craftsman. If the craftsman performs his duty towards his craft, people deem it good for him, and his matter in it becomes firmly established, gaining wealth and prestige for it, and it becomes a provision and treasure for him. If he disdains it and does not perform his duty towards it, the craft goes from his hand, its benefits are cut off from him, and he earns blame for himself and deprivation. Every soul has what it earned and bears what it acquired.\" It is said: This Hassan is the killer of his brother. He is known as Aqran. He died in the land of the Maghreb after ruling fifty years, having possessed the regions. Then his son Afriqis took the Kingship after him. When the Kingdom stabilized for him, he raided the lands of the Maghreb with the Arab tribes. He built a city there and named it after himself, Afriqiyah (Africa). He drove the Berbers to it from the land of Canaan and killed the King Jirjir (Gregory). It is said he is the one who named the Berbers by this name; because when he conquered the lands of the West and heard their gibberish, he said: \"What is this? How much is their babbling (Barbarah)!\" So they were named Berbers. The word Barbar in the language of the Arabs means the mixing of unintelligible sounds. When he returned from the raid of the Maghreb, he left there from the tribes of Himyar: Sanhaja and Kutama, and they are there to this day. Al-Tabari, Al-Jurjani, Al-Masudi, Ibn Al-Kalbi, and all genealogists said this. This is the third of the Tubba's. Then Afriqis advised his brother As'ad Abu Karib Al-Kamil, saying: \"You have known what our father advised us from what his father entrusted to him of the testaments of fathers and grandfathers, and the politics of this Kingdom which we were given to the exclusion of others. So you must hold fast to what you found me upon of spreading justice, manufacturing men (winning loyalty), outwitting the enemy, forgiving when able, blocking frontiers, and repairing breaches.\"",

    "text": "They mentioned that As'ad Al-Kamil Malik Karib is the fourth of the Tubba's. He took the Kingship after his brother and walked among the people with the biography of the ancients among his fathers and grandfathers. He possessed lands no other possessed, and was given justice and equipment no other king was given. It is mentioned that As'ad fell ill once and was on the verge of death from it, and that was after his return from his journey in which he entered the Sea of Darkness. He had a son called Hassan the Younger; he named him after his father. They mentioned that he did not rule and died before his father; he is the one whom his father As'ad Al-Kamil mentioned in his poetry. They mentioned that Hassan died before his father, so no one was more entitled to the Kingship after As'ad Al-Kamil than his grandfather (or ancestor) Al-Mu'ammar (The Long-Lived), known as Qarmal; he is Tubba' bin Zayd bin Rufaydah, the fifth of the Tubba's. He said to him advising him: \"There is nothing but has a foundation and basis. The foundation of the Kingdom and the basis is Men. The basis of Men is beneficence towards them. Whoever does good to Men, they obey him and listen to him. And whoever Men listen to and obey, the lands and those in them submit to him. And whoever the lands and those in them submit to is their owner after Allah. Its owner, the Kingdom does not last for him in it except with justice and beneficence, for there is no obedience for one who has no justice, and no kingdom for one who has no beneficence.\" Then he preserved his testament and acted upon it, so his conduct was good, and he possessed what the ancients among his fathers and grandfathers possessed. Then he advised his son Yasir, the sixth of the Tubba's, saying: \"O my son, the Kingdom is a lamp, and the King is the lighter of that lamp. If he protects it from a wind that extinguishes it, or a wick that does not absorb oil, or a stoker who betrays him, that lamp lasts for him and its light and brightness remain safe. If he distances himself from it and does not perform his duty towards it properly, the wind extinguishes it. If it is safe from the wind, it is not safe from the burning of the wick. And one is not safe, when the wick burns in the lamp holder, from the stoker going astray. So neither is the light shining, nor the stoker correct; neither is the wick safe, nor the lighter praised.\" This Yasir is called Yasir al-Ni'am (Yasir of the Blessings). He took the Kingship after his father Tubba' bin Zayd bin Rufaydah bin Amr Dhu al-Adh'ar. He preserved the testament of his father Tubba', stood firm on it, and acted upon it in the politics of the Kingdom between him and the people, and did not transgress the biography of his ancestors. He is the one who trod the land of Iraq, Persia, and the Romans and conquered their cities, and struck the city of Safad and the Valley of Jayhun (Oxus). His reign was one hundred and sixty years. Some narrators mentioned that he ruled the land of the Romans and appointed Mahan over them; Mahan perished, and his two sons Qayus and Yasir ruled after him. Then Yasir took the Kingship after his father Tubba', stood firm on his testament, preserved it, and acted upon it in the politics of the Kingdom between him and the people, and did not transgress the biography of his ancestors and the traditions of his ancients. He advised his son Shamir saying to him: \"O my son, manage the Kingdom, for management is its stability; beneficence is its policy; justice is its sustenance; men are its glory; wealth is its succor; and the clan is its equipment. There is no kingdom for one who has no management; no stability for one who has no beneficence; no beneficence for one who has no justice; no justice for one who has no sustenance; no sustenance for one who has no men; and no men for one who has no justice.\" It is mentioned that Shamir Dhu al-Janah took the Kingship after his father. He was one of the greatest kings in authority. He is the one called Tubba' the Great. He is the one who traveled in the Sea of Darkness after As'ad and reached the interruption of the earth, seeking in it what Dhu al-Qarnayn sought. As'ad is the one who built the city of Samarkand and it is attributed to him. He wrote on the Gate of Merv the inscription that is known. He has monuments he is famous for to this day. Likewise, he wrote on the Gate of China when he conquered and possessed it, and wrote on the Gate of the Land of the Maghreb beyond which is only sand whose waves crash like the waves of the seas and flow as floods flow in their valleys. He found no passage in it. Some of his companions crossed and did not return. So he ordered a statue of copper to be set up on the edge of the valley and wrote on its chest in the Himyaritic Musnad script: \"There is no passage behind it; let no one burden himself, go, and perish.\" End quote. Hisham Al-Kalbi said: Di'bil bin Ali Al-Khuza'i mentioned that, saying in his poetry: 'And they nailed Samarkand with their spears... And they planted with their hands a treasure. And they wrote the book at the Gate of Merv... And at the Gate of China they were the writers.'",

He performed Hajj, circumambulated the House for a week, sacrificed camels, clothed the Kaaba, and made a door and a lock for it. It is mentioned that this Tubba' is the one who arranged the kings and the sons of kings from his people in the tribes of the West and Non-Arabs, and their cities and metropolises. For every tribe of the Arabs, there was a king from Himyar and Kahlan who was listened to and obeyed. Then he gathered the kings, the sons of kings, the princes (Aqyal), and the sons of princes, and said to them: \"O people, time has exhausted most of it, and only the least of it remains. The abundant, if it decreases, is closer to deficiency than to increase. You are treading the path of fathers and grandfathers and will come to what they came to. Every day passes from a man's life.

This interval, whoever is mighty in it will be mighty by the appearance of a Prophet through whom Allah will strengthen His religion, singling him out with the Clear Book after a despair of Messengers, a mercy to the believers, and a proof against the disbelievers. Let that be with you and your sons, century after century, and generation after generation; to expect his appearance, believe in him, and strive to support him over all living things, until people return to the command of Allah Almighty.\" They mentioned that the kings and sons of kings from Himyar and Kahlan did not cease expecting the appearance of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, advising obedience to him, belief in him, Jihad with him, and standing in his support from that era until the appearance of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. So when he was sent, they were among the keenest people to support and obey him. Among them were those who heard and believed, and those who saw him, supported him, and strove in the path of Allah in his defense until certainty (death) came to him. The Clear Book spoke of that in His saying, Exalted is His matter: (And those who settled in the Home and [accepted] faith before them love those who migrated to them) to the end of the verse. And the Almighty's saying: (O you who have believed, whoever of you reverts from his religion - Allah will bring forth a people He will love and who will love Him) to the end of the verse. It is said: They are Hamdan and Tujib. They mentioned that when the Kingship transferred to Yusuf Dhu Nuwas, envy appeared towards him from some of his people, and biting words reached him that they uttered regarding his affair. He turned to them and said: \"O people, no leader bore a grudge and succeeded, nor did one seek a matter and rush into it and succeed. Enough with the one who says 'Yusuf Dhu Nuwas possessed this matter while he is not of its heirs nor of the sons of those who held it before him.' The matter is not as claimed and asserted. But the Kingdom has a foundation; whoever possesses it possesses the Kingdom.\" It is said this Dhu Nuwas is the one who dug the Trench. He followed Judaism. Yemen followed Judaism since the era of Tubba'. Christianity appeared in Najran and some of Yemen when Faymiyun came to them; his cause and news are too long to explain. They mentioned that Dhu Ru'ayn, named Buraym bin Zayd - and it is said he is from Kahlan - took the Kingship, improved conduct, and ruled a great kingdom. It is said: He turned to his household and children - having lived long until his sight weakened and hearing dulled - and said to them: \"O my sons, I have preserved the testaments of the ancients among my ancestors, and ruled the kingdom of my fathers and grandfathers. Age and gray hair have benefited me with manners and increase in knowledge of what rectifies a man's world and livelihood and revives exploits and virtues, more than what fathers and grandfathers bequeathed to me.\" They mentioned that his sons and cousins preserved this testament and acted upon it, and their conduct was praised. They mentioned that when Dhu al-Anfar took the Kingship and managed it, he turned to his clan and said: \"Two, even if their affair is small, are better than one, even if his affair is great. Unite and you will be mighty; do not divide or you will be humiliated.\" They mentioned that Hawal bin Harb bin Dhu Nafar took the Kingship and managed it according to the traditions of the ancients among his fathers and grandfathers; his name was Amer. They mentioned that he turned to his sons and brothers, saying to them: \"Not every advisor reaches all he wants in his advice. Eloquence is a guide to hitting the positions of wisdom. O my sons: Obey the strongest among you and you will be mighty; do not disobey his command or you will be humiliated. Unite and you will be feared; do not divide, and cooperate. Be fair to people and be just in what is presented to you of their affairs, you will be praised. Improve your manners with them, you will lead. Honor is with praise wherever it is; might is with fairness wherever it appears; and obedience is with suzerainty.\" They mentioned that Manakh preserved the testament, acted upon it, conducted people according to their habits, and the matter lasted for him. Then he called his brothers and people from Banu Abd Shams and said to them: \"A man does not lead except by his generosity, nor does he attain the utmost might except by his people. He is not granted people's love except by beneficence to them. He does not attain kingship except by spending money on the elite and commoners. And the Kingdom does not last for him except by his justice and beneficence.\"",

    "text": "They mentioned that Al-Hadhhad bin Sharhabil took the Kingship after his father. One day he went out hunting and saw a gazelle chased by a wolf, which had forced it into a tight spot with no escape. Al-Hadhhad charged at the wolf, drove it away from the gazelle, and singled it out to pursue it to see where its situation would end. He followed the trace of the gazelle and was cut off from his companions. While he was thus, a great city appeared to him containing everything: camels, goods, and types of fruits. He stood before it amazed. Suddenly, a man from the people of the town that appeared to him approached, greeted him, and welcomed him. Then he said to Al-Hadhhad: \"O King, I see you amazed at what appeared to you.\" Al-Hadhhad said to him: \"It is as you said. What is this city and who inhabits it?\" He said: \"This is Ma'rib, named after the name of your people. It is the city of Al-Aram, a clan of the Jinn.\" He said: While he was speaking with him, a woman passed by them. Seers had never seen a face more beautiful, a creation more perfect, a morning more radiant, nor a scent more pleasant than hers. Al-Hadhhad was captivated by her. The King of the Jinn knew that he loved her and was infatuated with her. He said to him: \"O Ibn Sharhabil, if you desire her, I will marry her to you.\" Al-Hadhhad thanked him and said: \"Who will guarantee that for me?\" The Jinni said: \"I guarantee what I offered of marrying her to you and reconciling between you in the easiest and most complete way. Have you recognized her?\" Al-Hadhhad said: \"I have not seen her before this day of mine.\" The Jinni said: \"She is the gazelle you saved from the wolf. We will reward you for your beautiful deed by gifting her to you. Prepare to enter upon her, for I marry you to her with the testimony of Allah Almighty and the testimony of His angels. If you wish that, come to us with the elite of your people, their kings, and your household to witness her engagement and wedding feast. Your appointment is the coming month of Rajab.\" He said: Al-Hadhhad bin Sharhabil departed, and the city disappeared from him. He found his companions striving in search of him. They said to him: \"Where were you? We have been searching for you since you left us, and we left nothing of these wildernesses but turned it over seeking you.\" He said to them: \"I did not go far from you.\" He proceeded walking with them reciting poetry: 'Wonders of time do not cease their marvels... And man, as long as he lives, is not free of wonder. I did not think the earth was inhabited... By other than non-Arabs in the horizons and Arabs. I used to be told of the harsh Jinn and... I returned their news only to lies. Until I saw lofty palaces built... For the Jinn, with doors and veils struck. Crops and water surround them... With laden trees of palms and grapes. From Jumada, and after it comes Rajab... And I will travel to the appointment in Rajab. Until I meet the best of Jinn from Aram... That is Ibn Sa'b the youth known as Yalab.' Then Al-Hadhhad bin Sharhabil went out for the appointment of his in-laws from the Jinn with the elite of his people and servants, until he met them. He and those with him found a palace they built for them in a desert of the land, surrounded by palms, grapes, crops, and fruits, with flowing water running in it. The people marveled at that greatly and saw a great kingdom. They stayed with him in the palace on carpets the likes of which they had never seen. Tables were brought near them with layers of food and colors they had never eaten anything better in taste or purer in scent. They drank a drink they had never drunk anything more digestible, delicious, wholesome, or lighter. They stayed with him three days. His wife, named Al-Harura daughter of Yalab bin Al-Sa'b Al-Aram, King of the Jinn, was wedded to Al-Hadhhad. Al-Hadhhad permitted his people and elite to return to their places. Then the King stayed with the Haruris for a time, and she bore him Bilqis. The palace the Jinn built for him became the house of his kingdom. Her father King Al-Hadhhad died, and her mother did not remain long after him. Bilqis remained with her maternal uncles from the Jinn. Her father's cousin, Shamir bin Ghash, sat in the Kingship; people listened to him and obeyed. Then he sent to Bilqis proposing to her. She accepted on the condition that he would not oppose her in anything she wanted or anything she disliked. He guaranteed that for her and married her.",

    "text": "They mentioned that when he saw her competence, care for the Kingdom, preservation, and good management of it, he would not command or forbid anyone other than her according to the custom established for her. Then he died, and no one knew of his death except in the days of Solomon son of David, peace be upon him. Her story with the Prophet of Allah is famous. Then the Kingship transferred from the clan of Bilqis to Zur'ah bin Ka'b, who is Himyar the Younger; his father is Abd Shams, and Abd Shams is Saba the Younger. They mentioned that when Zayd Dhu al-Kala' took the Kingship, he turned to his sons, brothers, and cousins and said to them: \"O assembly of brothers, sons, and cousins, if the Kingdom were to last for anyone, it would have lasted for your ancestors who ruled the lands, improved conduct among its people, took for the weak from the strong, secured the roads, humiliated the tyrants, enjoined good, forbade evil, and developed the earth: its east and west. You have their news, and I am not more knowledgeable than you to narrate to you of their news, exploits, and glories what would suffice you for what comes after.\" Then they mentioned that he became King, one whom Himyar and Kahlan agreed upon obeying, following, and accepting from in command, prohibition, war, and peace. They mentioned that he advised his sons, saying to them: \"O my sons, Himyar and Kahlan did not unite in obedience to me, following me, and accepting from me because I am from the noblest house among them, nor more entitled to the Kingdom among them than others. But they weighed the famous men and saw me as the most weighty in opinion when commanding and forbidding, so they entrusted me with their affair and preferred me with the Kingdom over others.\" These are the testaments of the preceding kings in summary. As for the Tubba's, they had no record, and most of their news is lost. Abu Sa'id mentioned and quoted from the books of eastern historians that the first of the Tubba' Kings was: Al-Harith, who is Al-Raish, then his son Al-Sa'b Dhu al-Qarnayn, then his son Abraha Dhu al-Manar, then Amr Dhu al-Adh'ar. In Al-Tijan: Himyar deposed him and made Sharhabil king, then Al-Hadhhad, then his daughter Bilqis, then Malik bin Amr, then Shamir Mar'ash - named Mar'ash for his trembling, and he is the one who destroyed the land of Samarkand. Then Sayfi bin Shamir ruled after him, then his brother Afriqis. Then the Kingship transferred to Banu Kahlan, and they were in Ma'rib, while the kings of Himyar were in Sana'a. Then the Kingship went to the tribe of Amr bin Amir. Then Himyar gathered after the ruin of the Dam under Abu Karib As'ad bin Sayfi; he went out against the Kings of the Factions (Muluk al-Tawa'if) and overcame them. Then his son Hassan, who killed Tasm and Jadis whose homes were in Jaww al-Yamamah. Then his brother Amr killed him, then his brother Abd al-Kilal succeeded him. Then Tubba' bin Hassan ruled after him, then Wali'ah bin Murshid, then Al-Sabah bin Wali'ah, then Abraha bin Al-Sabah, who had a biography and stories. After him Dhu Qayfan, after him Al-Hanifah Dhu Shanatir, after him Dhu Nuwas. Then the Abyssinians killed him and seized Yemen. Then Sayf bin Dhu Yazan liberated it from them; his kunya is Abu Murrah bin Aslam bin Zayd bin Al-Ghawth bin Sa'd bin Awf bin Adi bin Malik bin Zayd bin Shaddad bin Himyar bin Saba bin Ka'b bin Zayd bin Sahl bin Imran bin Qays bin Muawiyah bin Jashm bin Abd Shams bin Wael bin Al-Ghawth bin Qatan bin 'Arib bin Zuhayr bin Ayman bin Al-Hamisa' bin Himyar bin Saba bin Yashjub bin Ya'rub bin Qahtan bin Hud, peace be upon him. Then when Sayf liberated it from the Abyssinians with the help of Chosroes (Kisra), the Kingdom stabilized for him. The Arabs came to him congratulating him on the Kingship. It happened that when Abd al-Muttalib bin Hashim and Umayyah bin Abi Manaf came to him, Abd al-Muttalib asked permission for himself and those with him to reach him. He permitted them to enter. They entered upon Sayf bin Dhu Yazan. It was said to him: \"If you are of those who speak before kings, I have permitted you.\" Abd al-Muttalib stood before him while surrounding him were kings and sons of kings, and on his right and left were princes (Aqyal) and sons of princes. Abd al-Muttalib said: \"Allah has placed you, O King, in a high, difficult, impregnable, lofty, towering station. He has grown you in a plantation whose root is good, whose base is mighty, whose origin is firm, and whose branch is tall in the noblest mine and best homeland. You are the House of Glory and the Head of the Arabs, whom you led, their pillar upon which is the support, their stronghold to which servants take refuge, and their spring by which lands become fertile. Your predecessor was the best predecessor, and you are for us the best successor. The mention of one whom you are the predecessor of will not fade, nor will one whom you are the successor of perish.",

What brought us to you is what delighted us of lifting the distress that burdened us: So we are the delegation of congratulation (or condolence/calamity - text says 'Razziya' which means calamity, but context implies 'Tahni'a' / congratulation for victory over Abyssinians, or perhaps referring to the calamity of Abyssinian rule lifted). He said: Which of them are you, O speaker? He said: I am Abd al-Muttalib bin Hashim. He said: Are you our sister's son? He said: Yes. He said: Come near me, O Abd al-Muttalib. Then he turned to him and the people and said: Welcome, a greeting, an easy kneeling place, and a spacious king who gives abundant gifts. The King has heard your speech, known your kinship, and accepted your means. You have the night and day; honor is yours as long as you stay, and generosity when you depart. Then they departed to the guest house and stayed a month; they could not reach him nor did he permit them to leave. Then he paid attention to them, sent for Abd al-Muttalib, brought him near, cleared his assembly, and then said: \"O Abd al-Muttalib, I am confiding a secret to you regarding a matter. Had it been other than you, I would not have revealed it to him. But I found you to be a mine (of trust), so I will inform you of it. Let it be kept folded with you until Allah permits it. I found in the Hidden Book and the Stored Knowledge, which we chose for ourselves to the exclusion of others, grave news and great import. In it is the honor of life and the virtue of loyalty for people in general, for your clan entirely, and for you specifically.\" Abd al-Muttalib said to him: \"What is it, O King? One like you keeps secrets and does good. What is it, may the people of hair (Bedouins) and clay (city dwellers) be your ransom, group after group?\" The King said:",

If the King sees fit to inform me clearly, he would have clarified for me some clarification.\" He said: \"This is the time in which he is born. His name is Muhammad. Between his shoulders is a mole (Shamah). His father and mother die, and his grandfather and uncle sponsor him. Allah sends him openly and makes for him helpers from us (Ansar). Through them, He honors His allies and humiliates His enemies. Through them, He strikes people generally and makes permissible for them the best parts of the earth. He worships the Most Merciful, defeats Satan, breaks the idols, and extinguishes the fires. His speech is decisive, his judgment is just. He enjoins good and does it, and forbids evil and nullifies it.\" He said: Abd al-Muttalib fell prostrate. He said to him: \"Raise your head. Have you sensed anything of his affair?\" He said: \"Yes, O King. I had a son I admired, so I married him to a noble woman of the nobles of my people, named Amina bint Wahb bin Abd Manaf. She came with a boy I named Muhammad. His father and mother died, so I sponsored him, and perhaps tomorrow his uncle. Between his shoulders is a mole, and in him is everything you mentioned of signs.\" He said: \"By the Lord of the House and the Veils, and the Signs on the Monuments, you, O Abd al-Muttalib, are his grandfather without a lie. What I told you is what I told. So preserve your son and beware for him from the Jews, for they are his enemies, but Allah will not give them a way against him. Keep what I mentioned folded from this group with you, for I am not safe from envy entering them, regarding you having the leadership, so they plot evils against you and set traps for you. They and their sons are doers of that. Were it not that death sweeps me away before his mission, I would have marched with my cavalry and infantry until I come to him in Yathrib, the abode of his kingdom. For I find in the Speaking Book and Preceding Knowledge that Yathrib is the place of his command, in it are the people of his support, and the place of his grave. Were it not that I protect him from calamities and guard him against blights, I would have announced my youthfulness (new era?) of his affair. But I am dispensing this to you without falling short with those with you.\" Then he ordered for every man one hundred camels, ten slaves, ten bondmaids, ten pounds of silver, and a tripe full of ambergris. He ordered for Abd al-Muttalib multiples of what he gave the people. Then he said: \"Bring me his news and what becomes of his affair at the turn of the year.\" Sayf bin Dhu Yazan died before the year turned. Abd al-Muttalib used to say: \"O people, let none of you envy me for the King's abundant gift, for it is towards depletion. But envy me for what remains for me and my descendants after me of his honor and pride.\" If it was said to him: \"What is that?\" He would say: \"You will know later.\" Himyar consisted of clans and thighs. In Al-Iqd Al-Farid: Himyar bin Saba had children: Malik, Al-Hamisa', Zayd, Aws, Arin, Wael, Darmi, Amr Karib, Masruh, and Murrah, the clan of Ma'dikarib bin Nu'man. From the clans of Himyar are Banu Ma'dan bin Jashm bin Abd Shams bin Wael bin Al-Ghawth bin Qatan bin Ya'rub. Milhan is a clan: Milhan bin Amr bin Qays bin Muawiyah bin Jashm bin Shams bin Wael, the clan of Amir Al-Sha'bi the Jurist. He said: Milhan and Shi'an were counted in Hamdan; whoever of them is in Yemen is Himyarite. Among the clans of Himyar: Banu Shar'ab, who is Shar'ab bin Qays bin Jashm bin Abd Shams; to him Shar'abi spears are attributed. Among the clans of Himyar are Al-Duruz, also called Al-Azr, and called Ramdad. From them are Banu Fuhayd, Abd Al-Maklal, and Dhu Al-Kala', who is Yazid bin Al-Nu'man. From them is Dhu Ru'ayn bin Amr. Dhu Asbah is a clan from Asbah bin Malik bin Zayd bin Al-Ghawth. From them is Abraha bin Al-Sabah, King of Tihama; his son Shams was killed with Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, on the day of Siffin. From them is Rushd bin 'Arib bin Abraha bin Al-Sabah, who was the master of a tribe in Sham in the time of Muawiyah. From them is Zayd bin Mu'arrid the poet. From Banu Asbah is Imam Malik, Imam of the Abode of Migration (Medina), Al-Asbahi, may Allah have mercy on him. From the clans of Himyar: Dhu Yazan; from them is Al-Nu'man bin Qays bin Sayf bin Dhu Yazan. It came in the Hadith from the Prophet, peace be upon him: That he bought jewelry for twenty odd young camels and gave it to Dhu Yazan. To Dhu Yazan Yazani spears are attributed. From the clans of Himyar: Dhu Jadan, who is Al-Alas bin Al-Harith bin Zayd bin Al-Ghawth. From his descendants is Alqamah bin Sharhabil. Dhu Qayfan is a clan of Himyar, from Banu Adi bin Malik bin Zayd bin Sahl bin Amr bin Muawiyah. From them is Shu'ayb bin Dhu Hadam, peace be upon him, whom his people killed, so Allah empowered Nebuchadnezzar over them and he killed them, leaving no one. It is said this verse was revealed about them: (And when they perceived Our might, behold, they fled from it) to His saying: (extinguished/silent). He said when the swords of Nebuchadnezzar began on them, they were called by a terrible voice from the sky: \"O Vengeance for the Prophets!\" The grave of the Prophet Shu'ayb was in a mountain called Tin; there is no mountain in Yemen containing salt other than it. In it is the Prophet of Al-Rass from Qahtan of the Arabs. From the clans of Himyar: Al-Aqra'",

It is mentioned in the book 'Wills of the Kings' that Amr bin Haritha bin Ma' al-Sama' dispatched the clans of Quda'a to Al-Sham by the command of King Al-Qatat bin Amr the Himyarite. He appointed Zayd bin Aslam bin Amr bin Ilhaf bin Malik bin Ilhaf bin Quda'a bin Malik bin Himyar over them, tied the banner for him, and ordered them to listen and obey.

    "text": "Amr bin Haritha bin Ma' al-Sama' wrote him a letter to Al-Sham saying in its opening poetry... They mentioned that when Zayd went out from the clans of Quda'a to Al-Sham and marched to Hijaz, talk, enthusiasm, and envy occurred between him and his clan, so they separated. Some returned to Yemen and their offspring are there; they are Khawlan bin Amr bin Ilhaf bin Malik bin Zayd, and Adwan bin Zayd. As for those of Quda'a who proceeded to Al-Sham, they are Amilah bin Malik bin Rabi'ah bin Quda'a and their brothers. In Al-Sham, the most numerous, powerful, and mighty of them were Banu Aklab bin Wabrah. Among them is Janab, containing the 'Ama'ir (clans); among them Adi, Uways, Aym Allah, Sa'd Allah, Wahb Allah, and Zayd Allah. These are the sons of Rufaydah bin Nuwayr bin Kalb. Among them is Tanukh, Al-Qalays, and Kinana the Greater. These are the protectors of Al-Sham and its Bedouins, who have protection rights (khafarat) over the villages and cities of Al-Sham. Quda'a consists of clans and thighs. Among their clans is Banu Udhrah. From Banu Udhrah is Banu Rifa'a. From the clans of Udhrah is Banu Kathir. Banu Ahramah is a clan of Udhrah. From Udhrah is Banu Kahil; from them is Humayrah bin Al-Nu'man bin Hud. Banu Zuhrah is a clan of Udhrah; he is Zuhrah bin Zayd bin Sa'd bin Kahil. Banu Kahil is a clan of Udhrah; they are the clan of Urwah, companion of Afra bint Mu'asir bin Malik. Banu Hind is a clan of Udhrah; from them is Wahb the Jurist. From Udhrah and Kinana Udhrah are those from whom Rizah, brother of Qusay bin Kilab, comes. He is Rizah bin Rabi'ah, brother of Qusay bin Kilab through his mother. Rizah is the one who expelled Khuza'a from Mecca and made his brother Qusay bin Kilab king over Mecca. The dwellings of Quda'a were Al-Sirr known in Najd. He is the one saying in his march poetry: 'We marched the march from Ashmadhayn... And from Kilab we gathered a tribe.' His saying Al-Sirr is the Sirr known in Najd, and Ashmadhayn is known as Al-Washiyayn near Sajir. When Rizah returned from the raid of Khuza'a and appointing his maternal brother Qusay bin Kilab over Mecca, there was some grudge between Rizah and Hutakah bin Aslam bin Ilhaf bin Quda'a, and between Nahd bin Zayd bin Aslam bin Ilhaf bin Quda'a.

He was called Al-Kahlana. He lived two hundred and fifty years, and it is said four hundred and fifty years. He fought two hundred battles in it, and was a brave, victorious, auspicious man. The reason for his raid on Ghatafan bin Baghild bin Rayth bin Ghatafan was when they left Tihama entirely. Sada, a tribe of Madhhij, confronted them, fought them, defeated Sada, and took their wealth. When Ghatafan saw their wealth had increased, they said: Let us take a sanctuary (Haram) like Mecca, where no game is killed nor its refuge seeker harmed. So they built a sanctuary, and Banu Murrah bin Awf assumed its guardianship. When their action and consensus reached Zuhayr bin Janab, he said: By Allah, it shall not be. Then Zuhayr bin Janab raided Ghatafan with his people Quda'a and the rest of the Arabs. He fought Ghatafan, defeated them, disabled that sanctuary, and captured their women and wealth. His story is famous; we abbreviated it.",

    "text": "Al-Sadif is a clan; they are Banu Aslam bin Zayd bin Malik bin Zayd bin Hadhramaut, who conquered Egypt with Amr bin al-As, may Allah be pleased with him. Al-Quda'i said they settled in Egypt. From them is Jash'am Al-Khalil, the Companion, may Allah be pleased with him, one of those who pledged allegiance under the Tree; the Prophet, peace be upon him, clothed him. In Al-Isti'ab: Banu Bakal is a clan from Hadhramaut, and it is said from Himyar; from them is Manuf Al-Bakka', companion of the Prophet, peace be upon him. Al-Jawhari said: Most of them went and entered Kinda. Al-Jurjani the Genealogist said: There were kings among them approaching the Tubba's in high fame and renown. The first of them to rule was Amr bin Al-Ashnab bin Rabi'ah bin Iram bin Hadhramaut. Then his son Namir Al-Azj ruled one hundred years and fought the Amalekites. Then Kurayb bin Al-Azj ruled one hundred and thirty years. Then Marfad and Marwan, sons of Kurayb, ruled one hundred and forty years. Then Alqamah Dhu Qayfan ruled thirty years. Then his son Dhu 'Ayl bin Dhu 'Ayl ruled twenty years; he lived in Sana'a and raided the land of China, killed its king, and took his sword. When Sinan desired to raid China, Dhu 'Ayl moved to Sana'a. His grip intensified; he was the first of the Yemeni kings to raid the Romans (Rum) and the first to introduce silk and brocade to Yemen. Then his son Bad'at ruled in Hadhramaut forty years. Then his son Bad'il ruled, built fortresses, and left monuments. Then after him, Hammad bin Bad'il ruled in Hadhramaut, built his fortress Al-Mu'aqrab, and raided Persia in the time of Sabur Dhu al-Aktaf (Shapur II); rule lasted for him eighty years. He said he was the first of their kings to adopt screening (Hijab). Then Yashrah bin Dhu Dubb bin Dhu Hammad bin 'Ad ruled one hundred years; he was the first to arrange salaries and build bridges. Then Mun'im bin King Dithar bin Jadhima ruled, then Yashrah bin Jadhima bin Mun'im, then Namir bin Yashrah, then his son Sajin. In his days, the Abyssinians overcame Yemen. From Hadhramaut is Wael bin Hujr to whom the Prophet, peace be upon him, wrote. From his lineage is Ibn Khaldun, author of the History, whose name is Abd al-Rahman bin Muhammad bin Al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Jabir bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abd al-Rahman bin Khaldun Al-Hadhrami; his lineage connects to Wael bin Hujr. Hadhramaut has dispersed in all regions. In their land, Hadhramaut, are many tribes, as well as in Hijaz and elsewhere. This ends what we summarized of their lineage. Section: On Jurhum bin Qahtan. Jurhum were in Hijaz; they were clans and tribes, and among them were kings. They were inhabitants of Honored Mecca, and they were in Yemen. When Ya'rub bin Qahtan ruled, he appointed his brother Jurhum over Hijaz and made him king. Then his son Abd Yalil bin Yalil ruled after him, then Al-Madan, then his son Badilah bin Al-Madan, then his son Abd al-Masih, then his son Madan, then his son Abd al-Masih, then his son Al-Harith bin Madan, then his son Amr, then his brother Layth bin Al-Harith. They continued as kings until Ishmael, peace be upon him, settled in Mecca. They settled with him, he married from them, learned Arabic, and Al-Khalil (Abraham) came to him. They built the House (Kaaba), and its guardianship was in his hand and some of his sons. Then Jurhum seized the House. Then the Arab tribes were dispersed by the Flood of Al-'Arim. Khuza'a settled upon them and expelled Jurhum from Mecca. They have poems regarding that reason for their expulsion from Mecca, including the testament of Qusay bin Haritha bin Amr bin Amir to his sons: 'A land where the fearful have safety... And birds and beasts in it are safe. In it are the rites and signs which... The Honored Prophet Al-Khalil described. And the House is the House of Allah and the Sanctuary which... Without it is that well of Zamzam. And blood will be shed from them and from... The tribes of Jurhum, O my sons, the furthest blood.' It is said this testament was the reason Khuza'a expelled Jurhum from Mecca, may Allah guard it. Khuza'a preserved the testament, seized the House by it, and expelled Jurhum from Mecca to Yemen. It is said their remnants are there to this day. They have poems and news regarding that which we have no need for. Section: On the Lineage of Kahlan.",

Himyar had the right of obedience and sufficiency in assigned tasks upon Kahlan. Kahlan had the right of money and succor upon Himyar. The Stationary Kings in the House of Kingdom were from Himyar. The Kings in the Outskirts and Frontiers were from Kahlan. The seat of Himyar kings was Sana'a, and the seat of Kahlan kings was Ma'rib, which Saba, father of Himyar and Kahlan, dammed. Then when Kahlan took charge of the Outskirts and Frontiers and their works, and his matter stabilized on that, he said to his brother Himyar: \"I have resolved to send armies to the Outskirts and Frontiers, so order the interests for that.\" Himyar ordered money, horses, camels, food, and water skins, and obligated the people of his kingdom to comply with what Kahlan indicated. Then Kahlan dispatched Jurhum to the land of Hijaz, appointed over them a man called Hayy bin Bayy bin Jurhum bin Al-Ghawth bin Shaddad bin As'ad bin Jurhum bin Qahtan, ordered them to listen to him and obey, and distributed horses, equipment, and weapons among them. He gave them guides. He wrote with Hayy bin Bayy to the inhabitants of Hijaz from the Amalekites regarding hearing, obedience, and remitting tribute to him. They mentioned that Hayy bin Bayy went out to Hijaz among his people Jurhum and their followers, resided there as governor over it, and overcame the Amalekites. He said: When he settled among them from Najd, he and his followers possessed it, took its tribute from its people, and executed it to Kahlan. Then Kahlan called Amr bin Jahdar, a man from Thamud - it is said he is the grandfather of the Prophet Salih, peace be upon him - and dispatched him to the Valley mentioned by Allah Blessed and Exalted: (And Thamud, who hewed out the rocks in the valley). He ordered his people Thamud to march with him, hear, and obey. He wrote a letter for him to the inhabitants of the Valley, who were a people called Banu Zuhrah bin Imliq. He said: So Amr bin Jahdar marched to the Valley among his people and clan, Thamud, with camels, horses, and equipment, and drove the inhabitants of the Valley out of it until they listened to him and obeyed. Then Kahlan turned to his son Zayd after the death of his brother Himyar, saying to him: \"O my son, the Uncle has passed, and the Father is at the end of life.\" They mentioned that Zayd bin Kahlan preserved his father's testament, stood firm on it, and Al-Hamisa' entrusted him with what his father Kahlan was entrusted with for his brother Himyar. Then Zayd sent to his father's governors in the Outskirts and Frontiers renewing the covenant with them for him; they listened to him, obeyed, and paid him the tribute they used to pay his father. Then Zayd dispatched his son Amr - who is the father of Judham and Lakhm - to Midian and its surroundings. He tied the banner for him, gave him horses, equipment, and men, and ordered them to listen to him, obey, and pay tributes to him. Then Amr bin Zayd bin Kahlan marched to Midian as governor over it until he settled in it, possessed it, its people obeyed him, and he took its tribute. It is said Shu'ayb the Prophet, peace be upon him, is from his lineage. Then Zayd bin Kahlan, when Al-Hamisa' bin Himyar died, turned to his son Malik advising him in poetry. Then Malik bin Zayd bin Kahlan preserved his father's testament and took charge of what his father took charge of regarding Frontiers, Outskirts, and managing armies, in obedience to King Ayman bin Al-Hamisa' bin Himyar. Malik wrote to his father's governors, and they responded with hearing, obedience, and remitting tribute to him. Then Malik bin Zayd dispatched his son Rabi'ah, grandfather of Hamdan; he gave him horses, equipment, and men, tied banners for him over those with him, and wrote a letter for him to the inhabitants of Al-Ajwaf: the people of its plains and mountains from the remnants of 'Ad the Younger whose graves and ruins are known in the mountains and plains; his letter was poetry. Then he dispatched his son Udad bin Zayd bin Kahlan - who is the father of Tayy and Madhhij - to Al-Aghrad and Al-Asrar, from Najran, Tashlab, Bisha, Al-Khawa, and their surroundings of inhabited lands. He gave him horses, equipment, and flags. He wrote to their inhabitants, who were remnants of Aram bin Shem bin Noah; their ruins are clear and their graves known as Al-Iramiyat, being in the shape of hills and domes. Then Udad bin Zayd bin Kahlan marched until he settled among them as governor over them. They listened to him, obeyed, and paid him tribute. Mention of those related to Udad will come in the middle of this book, God willing.",

    "text": "Then Malik died, and his son Nabt took the Kingship in obedience to King Ayman bin Al-Hamisa' bin Himyar. He said: Then Nabt advised his son Thawr, father of Kinda, and Al-Ghawth, father of Al-Azd. They mentioned that Al-Ghawth bin Nabt preserved his father's testament, acted upon it, stood firm on it, and assumed his father's works of Outskirts and Frontiers in obedience to Zuhayr bin Ayman. He wrote to the governors, and they listened to him, obeyed, and paid tributes to him. Then Al-Ghawth dispatched his son Al-Azd to the tribes of Ma'rib and its surroundings, ordering them to listen and obey him. They mentioned that Ma'rib listened to Al-Azd and obeyed him after his father Al-Ghawth. He took charge of what his father Zuhayr bin Ayman took charge of regarding Outskirts and Frontiers. Tribute was raised to him and collected for the governor of the House of Kingship. For every King of the Outskirts and Frontiers, there was a worker from its workers who assumed his work, the most rashid (guided/capable) then the most rashid of his children, brothers, and cousins, raising tribute, listening, obeying, and collecting fees like the affair of those before him in obedience to whoever assumed the Outskirts from Kahlan. Then Ma'rib bin Al-Azd took charge of the Outskirts and Frontiers after his father Al-Azd. 'Arib bin Zuhayr had died, and his son Qatan took the Kingship after him. Then Ma'rib bin Al-Azd swore allegiance to Qatan bin 'Arib when he died, in verses he said. Then Ma'rib bin Al-Azd dispatched his brother Nasr bin Al-Azd to Al-Shihr with horses and equipment. They mentioned that Nasr bin Al-Azd marched to Al-Shihr until he settled it, and they paid him the tax (Kharaj). From his offspring is Al-Julanda bin Karkar bin Al-Sa'bar bin Mas'ud, King of Oman, who used to take every ship by force. The Kingdom remained established in the family of Julanda; what was collected for Al-Julanda was collected for them in their house of kingdom. They mentioned that Ma'rib bin Al-Azd advised his son Tha'labah bin Ma'rib bin Al-Azd in verses of poetry. Then Tha'labah bin Ma'rib bin Al-Azd preserved his father's testament, stood firm on it, obeyed King Qatan bin 'Arib, and assumed the works his father Ma'rib assumed. He wrote to his governors in the Frontiers and Outskirts, and they listened to him, obeyed, and paid tributes to him. Then Tha'labah bin Ma'rib dispatched Ahmas bin Awf bin Anmar bin Arash bin Al-Ghawth bin Nabt bin Malik bin Zayd bin Kahlan to Al-Tur, which is the land called Al-Sarah between Bawa, Ta'if, and Jarash. Then Ahmas and those of Himyar and Kahlan who followed him settled in Al-Sarah and possessed it. He said in 'Wills of the Kings': He asked Abu Ali Al-Hajari about who went out from Anmar bin Arash. He said Aqil bin Anmar, and their remnants are Shahran, Kuf, Nahis, Al-Aws, and Ma'd bin Bajila bin Anmar bin Arash. These tribes are known as: Bajila and Khath'am. Quhafah is a clan of Shahran. Then Tha'labah bin Ma'rib preserved his father's testament and stood firm on it. Then Tha'labah advised his son Imru' al-Qais. Then Imru' al-Qais bin Tha'labah bin Ma'rib bin Al-Azd preserved his father's testament, stood firm on it, and took charge of the Outskirts and Frontiers after his father, in obedience to King Al-Ghawth bin Qatan bin 'Arib. Then he entrusted his son Haritha Dhu al-Ahsab. It is said Al-Ghitrif bin Imru' al-Qais entrusted him with the Frontiers and Outskirts which he used to assume in obedience to the kings of Himyar. Then Haritha took charge of the Outskirts and Frontiers during his father's life and after his death in obedience to King Amr bin Jashm bin Abd Shams, and in obedience to King Al-Qatat bin Amr. Haritha lived over three hundred odd years. Then he advised his son Amir bin Haritha. They mentioned that Amir bin Haritha stood firm on his father's testament, and his sons and the sons of his people acted upon it. He assumed what his father Haritha assumed of Outskirts and Frontiers. They mentioned that Amir is the one Arabs call Ma' al-Sama' (Water of the Sky). This Ma' al-Sama' is the one who dispatched Zayd and the clans of Quda'a to Al-Sham and tied the banner for him. The news of Zayd preceded in the beginning of this book in his lineage in Quda'a. They mentioned that Ma' al-Sama' Amir bin Haritha Dhu al-Ahsab lived three hundred and sixty odd years. He took charge of the Outskirts and Frontiers for some kings of Himyar: Al-Qatat, then Abraha bin Shaddad, then Afriqis bin Abraha. They mentioned that he advised his son Al-Muzayqiya son of Ma' al-Sama', who is Amr bin Amir. Then Amr bin Amir preserved his father's testament, stood firm on it, and took charge of the Kingship after him for the kings of Himyar regarding the Outskirts and Frontiers. He wrote to his father's governors in every land; they listened to him, obeyed, and paid him the tributes they used to pay his father. They mentioned that Amr bin Amir was the wealthiest of the people of his time, having the most money, numbers, and estates. He owned two-thirds of the Garden of Ma'rib. He lived a long life, was blessed with a group of children, and lived until he saw seven generations (fathers) from his offspring, his sons' offspring, and his sons' sons. They mentioned he assumed the Outskirts and Frontiers for the kings of Himyar: Amr bin Abraha, Sharhabil bin Amr, and Al-Hadhhad bin Sharhabil, in-law of the Jinn, father of Bilqis.",

    "text": "They mentioned that at that time, a soothsayer informed Amr bin Amir of the ruin of Ma'rib and warned him of it, saying to him: \"Be cautious in saving yourself from its harm, for you are in the time of the loss of these two gardens.\" Then Amr bin Amir used a trick on his people. He held a feast gathering his household and clan. He advanced to his son Tha'labah - it is said to Wada'ah, his youngest son - and said to him: \"O my son, you know what we are on the verge of regarding the ruin of this Dam and the loss of these two gardens. I have resolved to sell what I own in them, and no one will buy it from me except by a trick I devise. I will exchange words with you in the presence of the notables of the clan from Himyar and Kahlan. Whenever I speak a harsh word to you, reply with similar or harsher. If you see me intending to raise my hand to strike you, raise your hand so people see you intended to strike me, so that I may swear to sell my property in the land of Ma'rib of the two gardens and others, and my exit from it, and people will see I intend good by that.\" When people gathered at his place for the feast from Himyar and Kahlan, finished eating, washed their hands, and drink was brought near, Amr bin Amir turned to his son Wada'ah and spoke to him with harsh words. Wada'ah replied with words like his and fiercer. Amr raised his hand against his son Wada'ah to slap him. He returned his hand against him and said: \"By Allah, if you slap me, I will slap you.\" At that, Amr bin Amir swore an oath with no expiation to sell all his property in the land of Ma'rib of the two gardens and others, and to leave it. He called out: \"Is there a buyer?\" When people saw he was serious about selling, they approached him and said: \"Do you permit us to bargain with you for your properties?\" He said to them: \"I have permitted you, so bargain.\" They said: \"We have taken half of what you have for one hundred loads of everything.\" He said: \"It is yours for what you asked.\" They paid him one hundred loads of everything. The second half was safe for him, and he found no buyer for it, so he left it. He went out from Ma'rib with all his children, family, and clan entirely. He proceeded with numbers known only to Allah of horses, camels, and other types of wealth and grazing livestock. His people and all those with him did not reach a water source but drained it, nor intended a land but made it barren. They sent scouts into the lands seeking water for them. One of their scouts was a man from Banu Amr bin Al-Ghawth; he went out for them guiding to their brothers Hamdan. He saw a narrow land whose pastures and waters would not suffice their livestock. Among their scouts was also 'A'idh bin Abdullah bin Nasr Al-Azdi; he went out scouting and saw a land that could carry them, but its waters and pastures would not suffice their livestock given its large population. So they stayed in Azal and Baridah and their surroundings; their horses, camels, and livestock grazed. Climbing the mountains suited them, and they descended from them into Tihama and overcame Ghafiq there. They stayed in Tihama for some time, then marched to Hijaz. They dispersed from Hijaz into groups; every thigh marched to a land. Some settled in Al-Sarah, some stayed in Mecca and its surroundings, some marched to Mudar then to Iraq and Al-Sham, and some marched to Oman. He said: As for those of Azd who settled in Oman: Yahmad, Al-Haddab, and Malik. As for those who settled in Iraq: Jadhima bin Al-Waddah and the children of Abdullah bin Al-Azd. As for those who settled in Al-Sham: Jafna. As for those who settled in Medina: Aws and Khazraj. As for those who settled in Mecca and its surroundings: Khuza'a. As for those who settled in Al-Sarah: Bajila bin Anmar bin Arash bin Khath'am bin Anmar bin Arash. From Azd are Al-Hijr, Lahb, Narah, 'A'idh, Bariq, Al-Sawam, Haritha, Sinjar, Ali, Oman, Daws, Al-Namir, Hawalah, Al-Buqum, Barqa, Shahran, Amr, and Alma'. All these are from the tribes of Azd and the rest of Kahlan. Then when Amr bin Amir went out with the entirety of his people, Azd, from the land of Ma'rib, Kinda became occupied with the works Amr bin Amir used to handle of Outskirts and Frontiers. Likewise, Madhhij and Hamdan became occupied with the lands and works in their hands. Lakhm and Judham sat, and their lands became occupied with the hardships of Outskirts and Frontiers in them. The children of Nasr bin Al-Azd ended up in the land of Fars and Jua bin Shajar, which is the clan of Al-Julanda bin Karkar. Quda'a spread in Al-Sham, the shoulders of Hijaz, and Najd. Udhrah settled in Hijaz from it, and Juhaynah settled in Radwa. The children of Amr bin Amir advanced on the lands; they did not enter a land but overcame the people of that land. Khuza'a overcame Jurhum in Mecca. Aws and Khazraj overcame the Jews in Medina. Al-Mundhir overcame the people of Iraq there. The family of Jafna overcame the people of Al-Sham there. As for the children of Amr bin Amir bin Haritha, when death approached him, he gathered his sons, his sons' sons, and the sons of his people, addressed them, and advised them. He had eight hundred children; four hundred of them were noble lords, and four hundred were kings.",

    "text": "In the book 'Wills of the Kings', he said to them in his testament when they attended: \"The caller has made you hear, the proof is binding upon you, and the command has reached you... No one is in greater calamity or affliction in his affair than one who wastes certainty and is deceived by hope. Permanence is only after annihilation. We have inherited from those before us, and those after us will inherit from us. Departure has come from a fleeting place and shifting shade. An obscene time and grave matter have cast a shadow upon us. So rectify what you are advancing to, and be content with the Everlasting as a successor to the perishing. Be moderate in seeking livelihood. Endure calamities, for by reckoning (reward with God) you attract blessings. Seek the continuance of honor by gratitude before transfer and the shifting of blessings. Days are turns (states), and you are in them prey to calamities and perils. So desist and leave aside the paths in this deceptive world cut off from its people. In every sandy hill is a height, and with every morsel are choking fits. You do not attain a blessing except by parting with another. You are the successors after the predecessors; ages and days annihilate you, and you are the deaths upon yourselves. In your livelihoods are the causes of your deaths. Nothing prevents you from it, and nothing avails you in it; in every cause among you is a fallen one. These night and day do not raise anything but they put it down; they are worthy of scattering what you gathered. O people: Seek good and its people, and beware of evil and its people. Know that better than good is its doer, and worse than evil is its doer.\" When Amr bin Amir died, the Arabs continued to preserve the testament he bequeathed in a poem we did not mention, act upon it, conduct their affairs according to it, and advise with it in Jahiliyyah and Islam. They have poems regarding it which Arabs recite in their assemblies and gatherings, and in meeting enemies, honoring the guest, protecting the refuge seeker, and repelling the aggressor. It is mentioned in 'Wills of the Kings' that Qusay bin Amir, who is the father of Khuza'a, advised his sons saying to them: \"O my sons: The scout does not lie to his family, and the knowledgeable one does not approve of his ignorance. O my sons, wisdom is a planting in the hearts, like grain in the earth; whatever you plant in noble soil, its vegetation grows and its harvest thrives. Whatever you plant in lying salty soil, its vegetation is bad and its harvest does not thrive. This is so you know that the good only accepts the good, and the good only grows with its like. O my sons: Strive in five things by which you will be mighty and stable: Strive in removing the enemy, supporting the friend, honoring the guest, manufacturing the clan (winning loyalty), protecting the refuge seeker, and attaining what is hoped. I command you with that, and forbid you from what opposes it.\" They mentioned that the news of Khuza'a expelling Jurhum from Mecca, may Allah guard it, was in preservation of the testament of their father Qusay. They acted upon it until they seized the House to the exclusion of Jurhum, and exiled Jurhum from Mecca to Al-Asdar. It is said remnants of Jurhum exist to this day. They mentioned that Amr bin Amir Al-Khuza'i advised his sons: Ka'b, Adi, and Mus'ad, saying poetry. They mentioned that Al-Harith bin Tha'labah bin Amr bin Amir, who is the father of Aws and Khazraj, turned to his sons saying poetry. It is mentioned in 'Wills of the Kings' that Aws and Khazraj memorized all that their father Tha'labah advised them, stood firm on it, as did their children after them. Their seeking of might and the command by which they would lead others of the Arabs did not cease until the appearance of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. So from them came what came of support and Jihad before him, and standing in the face of all Arabs. Then he mentioned that Jafna bin Tha'labah bin Amr bin Amir turned to his sons saying to them: \"O my sons, compete in noble deeds and avoid what diverts you from them. I imagine you kings excluding other people. A king is not a king until he is fair, just, giving of wealth, brave, wise, knowledgeable, intelligent, forbearing, neither tyrannical nor oppressive. I have seen you, O my sons, possessing these qualities I enumerated for you. Then by Allah, I know you by them excluding other people. I was given glad tidings of your kingship before you were born. O would that he who witnessed me of my paternal and maternal uncles on that day were existing to this day of mine.\" Jafna is the first of Ghassan to rule Al-Sham. To him represent the kings of Banu Ghassan whom Hassan bin Thabit mentioned saying: 'To Allah belongs a group I drank with... One day in Jillaq (Damascus) in the first time.'",

    "text": "To the end of the poem in which he mentioned Maria their grandmother, wife of Tha'labah bin Amr. She is the daughter of Shamir bin Ghash, King of Himyar, and she is the mother of Al-Harith the Elder. They mentioned that his son Amr bin Al-Harith the Elder advised his son saying poetry. It is mentioned that Amr preserved the testament of his father Al-Harith, stood firm on it, and possessed what his father possessed of the land of Al-Sham and Arab tribes. They mentioned that he prescribed for himself every night a virgin girl he must have from the captives his horses raided from the rebels. That remained his habit until the sister of Amr bin Al-Sa'iq Al-Adwani fell into captivity with him. He said: Amr bin Al-Harith did not notice, having ordered her to be brought, until a youth knocked on the door of the assembly he was in. Amr opened the door and looked out, and lo, a horseman saying poetry: 'O daring King, do you not see... Morning and night, how they gather? Know and be certain that your kingdom is fleeting... And know that as you judge, you shall be judged.' He said: So Amr bin Al-Harith called out and said to him: \"Allah has secured you regarding who was with me of yours, or of all people regarding who fell to them of captives.\" Then he ordered that no captive woman remain but be carried and returned to her family, and released to her whatever was among the prisoners from her family. Then Amr bin Al-Harith advised his son Al-Harith, whom the Arabs call Al-Harith the Lame (Al-A'raj). It is said Amr had a soothsayer informing him of events, warning and cautioning him. Then Al-Harith the Lame preserved his father's testament, stood firm on it, and after him his son Amr bin Al-Harith possessed what he possessed of lands and Arab tribes. Then Al-Harith the Lame advised his son Abu Mundhir Amr bin Hind the Burner (Al-Muharriq) in verses of poetry. Then Amr bin Hind, son of Auf the Shaybani (mother?), preserved his father's testament, stood firm on it, and possessed what his father possessed of Arab lands and others. He was named Al-Muharriq (The Burner) because his maternal uncle, who was being wet-nursed among Banu Tamim, was killed by a man from Al-Barajim. Al-Barajim is a clan of Tamim. He went out to them, killed a great slaughter among them, then took one hundred men alive and burned them in fire; therefore he was named Al-Muharriq. Al-Farazdaq Al-Tamimi mentioned him in his poetry, and Al-Tirimmah Al-Ta'i in his poetry. It is mentioned that Amr advised his son Al-Ayham in verses we did not mention. Then Al-Ayham preserved his father's testament, stood firm on it, acted upon it, and possessed what his father possessed. Then Al-Ayham advised his son Jabala, saying: \"O my son, you are the owner of Al-Sham after me, and the master of my affair to the exclusion of my children. You are in the time of possessing this matter which we were given to the exclusion of others. If you see that, look to yourself for what adorns it, and to your people for what protects them.\" Jabala remained a king obeyed among his people Ghassan; the tribute of Al-Sham came to him. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was sent while Jabala was King of Al-Sham. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, died while Jabala was King of Al-Sham. Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, sat and remained in the Caliphate as long as he did, while Jabala was King of Al-Sham. When it was the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, Jabala converted to Islam and came to Medina with five hundred horsemen from the kings of his people, wearers of crowns. He marched as a pilgrim until he entered Honored Mecca. He was circumambulating the House one day of the Hajj days, wearing an Izar and Rida'. A man from Fazara stepped on his Izar. Jabala slapped him a slap that crushed the Fazari's nose. He came with blood flowing on his chest until he stood at the door of Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, give me justice against this tyrant; for he slapped me and left me in this state.\" Umar said: \"Why did you slap the man?\" Jabala said to him: \"He stepped on my Izar.\" Umar said to him: \"As for you, you have confessed. Either you ransom yourself from him, or you give him the slap (retaliation).\" Jabala said: \"I will do nothing of what you said.\" He intended to stir up sedition between him and Umar. They entered upon him and spoke to him, so some of what was in him calmed. People asked him not to make it a sedition, so he agreed to that. When it was some days later, he went out and proceeded to Al-Sham. Then he departed to the land of the Romans with those of Ghassan who followed him. He entered upon Heraclius, King of the Romans, while angry, and converted to Christianity along with his followers. Then he regretted leaving Islam and entering Christianity: 'The nobles became Christian for the sake of a slap... And there was no harm in it had I been patient with it. Obstinacy and pride cost me for it... And substituted the sound eye for the one-eyed. Oh, would that my mother had not borne me, and would that I... Had returned to the saying Umar said. Oh, would that I were herding camels in a wasteland... Or were a prisoner in Rabi'ah or Mudar.' Banu Ghassan are clans. They were named Ghassan after a water at Al-Mashal called Ghassan; whoever drank from it of Azd is Ghassani, and whoever did not drink from it is not Ghassani.",

Section: On Anmar brother of Al-Azd. He is Anmar bin Arash bin Amr bin Al-Ghawth bin Nabt bin Malik bin Zayd bin Kahlan. Some genealogists used to attribute clans from this Anmar to Anmar bin Nizar, but Ibn Nizar had no offspring. Al-Kalbi mentioned that Anmar bin Nizar had no offspring except what is said in Bajila. It says in Al-Ibar: Bajila denies this and says that Arash bin Amr married Salamah daughter of Anmar bin Nizar, so she bore him Anmar bin Arash and she bore him Khath'am, named after a camel. The mother of Khath'am bin Anmar bin Arash is Hind daughter of Malik bin Al-Amir bin Al-Shahid bin Akk. Anmar bin Arash also married the daughter of Sa'b bin Sa'd Al-Ashirah, so she bore him Abqar, Al-Ghawth, Suhaybah, and Khuzaymah; their mother is Bajila, they were known by her. It says in Al-Ibar: The lands of Bajila along with their brothers Khath'am were in the Sarawat in Yemen, and in Hijaz up to Qabalah. Then they dispersed in the days of Islamic conquest, and only a few remained in their homelands. From Bajila is Jarir bin Abdullah Al-Bajali; he was beautiful. He is the one about whom it is said: 'Were it not for Jarir, Bajila would have perished; what an excellent youth and what a wretched tribe.' From the clans of Bajila is Al-Samhah; they are Banu Al-Samhah bin Sa'd bin Abdullah bin Tha'labah bin Muawiyah bin Zayd bin Bajila bin Anmar bin Arash.

    "text": "Udad had children: Tayy, Madhhij, A'r (Ash'ar?), and Murrah. They mentioned in 'Wills of the Kings' that Zayd bin Kahlan dispatched Udad to Al-A'rad and Al-Asrar of Najran, Tathlith, Sadum, Al-Hanu, and surrounding inhabited lands. He sent elephants and equipment with him, and wrote to their inhabitants, who were remnants of 'Ad bin Iram bin Shem bin Noah peace be upon him. Their ruins are clear, and their graves are known as Al-Iramiyat because they are in the shape of hills. The testament of Zayd to Udad has preceded in this book. It is mentioned that Tayy bin Udad took the Kingship after his father Udad and preserved his father's testament. They mentioned that Tayy lived a long life, exceeding four hundred odd years. They mentioned he advised his sons in verses of poetry. He said the dwellings of Tayy were anciently in Al-Jurf of the land of Yemen. They left following the departure of Azd from it and settled in Samira, it is said in the neighborhood of Banu Asad bin Khuzayma. Then they overcame them for Aja and Salma, two mountains in the land of Tayy known as the Two Mountains of Tayy, so they continued there and dispersed in the Islamic conquests. Abu Sa'id said: From them are many nations filling the plain and mountain of Hijaz, Najd, Iraq, and Sham. They are the owners of leadership among the Arabs to this day in Iraq and Sham. They are many clans. Tayy had children: Al-Ghawth, Qatrah, and Al-Harith. To Qatrah was born Sa'd; Sa'd married Jadila daughter of Subay' bin Himyar the Younger, so they were known by her. They are called Jadila after their mother's name. Tayy was two tribes: Jadila and Al-Ghawth. From the clans of Al-Ghawth is Banu Jarm; his name is Tha'labah bin Amr bin Al-Ghawth. From the clans of Jarm is Banu Jayyan clan; from them is Imam Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Malik the Grammarian, Al-Ta'i Al-Jayyani, author of famous works (Alfiyya). From Banu Jarm is Shamjan clan. From its clans is Jadhima mentioned by Al-Hamdani. From them is Banu Al-Udhrah clan of Jadhima; their dwellings are the land of Gaza. Banu Al-Ajilah of Jadhima of Jarm Tayy; their dwellings are with their people. Al-Abadilah clan of Jadhima of Jarm Tayy; their dwellings are with their people in the land of Gaza. From them are Abadilah of Al-Hijan. From them is An'am who is in the land of Jarash of Hijaz; they are a clan of Tayy. Al-Ahamidah is a clan of Jarm Tayy; their dwellings are in the land of Gaza. From Al-Ahamidah are the people of Al-Faqrah between Medina and Yanbu; they are counted in Banu Salim bin Harb. From the clans of Jarm is Banu Hani clan of Jadhima of Jarm Tayy. From them is Iyas bin Qabisah. Chosroes appointed him over Al-Hira after Al-Nu'man. He is the leader of the Arabs and Persians against Banu Shayban on the Day of Dhi Qar. Some scholars of Al-Ahsa mentioned to us that Banu Iyas people of Oman are from this Banu Iyas Al-Ta'i, reporting from their scholars. We have presented their mention in Iyas of Azd. From the clans of Tayy is Banu Amr bin Al-Ghawth bin Tayy. From them is Bulan clan; his name is Husayn. From Bulan are the three who established the Arabic script.

He came as a delegation to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and converted to Islam along with a delegation from Tayy. The Prophet, peace be upon him, named him Zayd al-Khayr (Zayd of Goodness) and said to him: \"No one was described to me in Jahiliyyah and I saw him in Islam but he was less than described to me, except you; I saw you above what was described to me.\" The Prophet, peace be upon him, granted him Aja and Salma and lands with them. Zayd, may Allah be pleased with him, died, it is said, upon his return from the Prophet, peace be upon him. Zayd was a poet, orator, doer of good, brave, and generous. There was mutual satire between him and Ka'b bin Zuhayr. Zayd was tall and massive; he would ride a huge horse and his feet would drag as if riding a donkey. Zayd had a son named Urwah who was generous. From Banu Nabhan are Al-Humayd, the Emirs in the Caliphate of Banu Abbas in the Frontiers. From them are Muhammad bin Humayd, Qahtabah bin Humayd, Abu Nasr, Abu Sa'id Al-Nafari, and Abu Shuja'. These and their successors were among the most generous and brave people in their time. They were Emirs of the Frontiers; their death was by striking and stabbing on the withers of horses. Poets have praised them extensively. From the clans of Tayy is Banu Tha'l bin Amr bin Al-Ghawth of Tayy. They are known for proficiency in archery. Al-Jawhari said they are the ones meant by Imru' al-Qais in his saying: 'Many an archer from Banu Tha'l'.",

    "text": "Born to Tha'l was Jarwal. To Jarwal was born Rabi'ah. To Rabi'ah was born Ahzam and Amr. To Amr was born Aman, a clan of Tha'l. To Ahzam was born Adi, named Hazumah. From Banu Adi is Hatim Al-Ta'i. He is Hatim bin Abdullah bin Adi bin Sa'd bin Hashraj bin Imru' al-Qais bin Adi. His kunya is Abu Adi and Abu Saffanah. His son Adi reached Islam and converted. He said: \"O Messenger of Allah, my father used to join ties of kinship and do good.\" He said: \"Your father desired a thing and achieved it.\" His daughter Saffanah was brought among the captives of Ali to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. She said: \"O Muhammad, the parent has perished and the provider is absent. If you see fit to release me and not let the Arab tribes rejoice at my misfortune, for my father used to free the captive, protect the honor, relieve the distressed, feed food, spread peace, and never turned away a seeker of need. I am the daughter of Hatim.\" The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"These are truly the qualities of believers. Had your father been Muslim, we would have prayed for mercy on him. Release her, for her father loved noble character, and Allah loves noble character.\" When the Prophet, peace be upon him, bestowed favor upon her, she prayed for him saying: \"May a hand thank you that became poor after wealth, and may a hand not rule over you that became rich after poverty. May Allah hit with your favor its proper places, and not make you have a need for a miser, nor strip a blessing from a generous person except making you a cause for its return to him!\" Ibn Al-A'rabi said: Hatim was one of the poets of Jahiliyyah. He was generous; his generosity resembled his poetry, and his saying matched his deed. Wherever he settled, his place was known. He was victorious; if he fought he overcame, if he took booty he plundered, if he raced he won, and if he captured he released. When the month of Rajab began, he would slaughter ten camels every day and feed the people, and they gathered around him. The first sign of his generosity was when his father left him with his camels while he was a boy. A group of poets passed by him: Abid bin Al-Abras, Bishr bin Hazim, and Al-Nabigha, intending Al-Nu'man. They said to him: \"Is there any hospitality (Qira)?\" They did not know him. He said: \"You ask about hospitality while you have seen the camels and sheep? Dismount.\" So they dismounted. He slaughtered a camel for each one of them. He asked them their names, and they informed him. He distributed the camels and sheep among them. His father came and said: \"What have you done?\" He said: \"I have collared you with the glory of time like the collar of a pigeon.\" His father said: \"I will never blame you.\" He said: \"Then I do not care.\" From his stories: He went out in the Sacred Month. When he was in the land of Anazzah, a prisoner of theirs called out to him: \"O Hatim, captivity and lice have eaten me.\" He said: \"Woe to you, I am not in the land of my people, and I have nothing to ransom you with.\" So he bought him from the Anazzis and stayed in his place in shackles until the ransom was brought. From his stories, Mawiyah, wife of Hatim, narrated saying: A drought befell people taking away hoof and claw (livestock). We spent a night in extreme hunger. We started distracting Adi and Saffanah until they slept from hunger. Suddenly a woman said: \"O Abu Saffanah, I came to you from hungry children.\" He said: \"Bring your two children, by Allah I will satisfy them.\" I said: \"With what, O Hatim? By Allah, your children only slept by distraction.\" He went to his horse and slaughtered it. Then he kindled a fire. People came by its light, took to roasting and eating. He covered himself with his cloak and slept; by Allah, he did not taste it. His stories are famous. Here is a strange story: Muhriz mawla of Abu Huraira narrated saying: A group from Abd al-Qays passed by Hatim's grave and camped near it. A man called Abu Al-Yakhbari stood up to it and kicked his grave with his foot. One of them said: \"Woe to you, do you not hear? Do you provoke a man who has died?\" He said: \"Tayy claims that no one stayed with him but he hosted him.\" Then night covered them at the grave and they slept. Abu Al-Yakhbari woke up terrified saying: \"O my mount!\" They said to him: \"What is wrong with you?\" He said: \"Hatim came to me in sleep and hamstrung my she-camel with a sword while I was looking at him, and he recited poetry to me I memorized, which is this: Abu Al-Yakhbari and you are a man... Wronging the clan, reviling it. You came with your companions seeking hospitality... At a pit whose owl has screeched. Do you seek blame for me at the overnight stay... While around you are Tayy and its livestock? For we surely satisfy our guests... And the mounts come so we select them.\" He said: When they got up, the man's she-camel was hamstrung (hocked) and dying, so they slaughtered it and spent the night eating. They said: \"Hatim hosted us alive and dead.\" He said: When they woke up, they let Abu Al-Bukhturi ride behind (someone) and marched. Suddenly a man riding a camel and leading another was saying: \"Which of you is Abu Al-Yakhbari?\" He said: \"I am.\" He said: \"Take this camel. I am Adi bin Hatim. Hatim came to me in sleep and claimed he hosted you with your she-camel, and ordered me to compensate you for it.\" To this incident Ibn Darah Al-Ghatafani referred praising Adi bin Hatim saying: 'Your father Abu Saffanah, goodness did not cease... With Shaybah until he died desiring good.'",

    "text": "'Proverbs are struck by him in poetry while dead... And he was, when alive, a companion to it. His grave hosted the guests when they descended by him... And no grave before him ever hosted a rider.' The news of Hatim is famous. Adi, may Allah be pleased with him, converted to Islam and had fame in Islam. It came in the Hadith: When he came to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, as a delegate, he seated him on his mattress, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, sat on the ground.

He said: \"What is your business?\" They said: \"Locusts fell in your courtyard, so we came to take them.\" He mounted his horse, took his spear, and said: \"By Allah, no one of you touches them but I kill him. You have seen them in my protection.\" He kept guarding them until the sun grew hot and they flew and moved from his protection. He said: \"Do with them as you wish.\" It is said his name is Haritha bin Murr bin Hanbal Al-Ta'i. He was from Tayy Amir bin Haritha. He was the first to establish hospitality. It is mentioned that Qays was one of the generous Arabs. It was said to him: \"O Qays, have you seen anyone more generous than you?\" He said: \"Yes. We stayed with a Bedouin of Tayy. We stayed with a woman whose husband (came and) she said: 'A guest has come to you.' He brought a camel and slaughtered it and said: 'Help yourselves to it.' We stayed with him while the sky was raining. When the morrow came, he brought another and slaughtered it and said: 'Help yourselves to it.' We said: 'By Allah, we ate only a little of what you slaughtered for us last night.' We stayed with him for days while the sky rained, and he did this. When we wanted to depart, we left one hundred dinars and said to the woman: 'Apologize for us to him,' and we left. When the day rose high, the man shouted behind us: 'O mean riders, you gave us the price of your hospitality!' Then he caught up with us and said: 'You shall take your money or I will stab you with this spear.' So we took it and departed.\" From the clans of Tha'l: Buhtur bin Atud bin Salaman bin Tha'l bin Al-Ghawth bin Tayy bin Ali. From them is Al-Buhturi the famous poet.

He is the one saying, when Tayy rose to fight the Tatars and defeated them, and Tayy returned, poetry: 'Ask the high spears about our high ambitions... And call the swords to witness, did hope fail in us? Ask the Arabs and Turks what we did... In the land of the grave of Ubayd Allah with our hands. We marched and our resolves did not weaken... From what we desire, nor did our endeavors fail. On the day of the battle of Zawra' Iraq, we... Repaid the enemies with what they repaid us (judged them as they judged us). With lean horses we did not tether them branded... Except to raid with them those who spent the night raiding us. And youths, if we speak, they lend their ears... To our saying, or if we call them, they answer us. A people, if they quarrel, they are Pharoahs... One day, and if they judge, they are balances (of justice). They donned reason as a cloak, but if... The fire of war heated up, you would think them madmen in it. The starlings, when their rising one rose... Imagined they had become falcons. They emptied the mosques of our sheikhs and transgressed... Until we charged, so we emptied the Dewans (bureaus). Then we turned back, and our sharp swords remained... Rising in wonder, and the spears shaking for us.",

    "text": "And for the blood on our clothes is a clot... Its scent suffices us from the fragrance of musk. We are a people whose morals refused, out of honor... That we begin harm against those who do not harm us. White are our deeds, green are our pastures... Black are our battles, red are our swords. Helplessness does not appear in us before attaining desire... Even if we saw deaths in our desires.' From the clans of Jadila is Banu Lam. They are clans and thighs. He is Lam bin Amr bin Tarif bin Amr bin Malik bin Amr bin Thumamah bin Malik bin Jad'a' bin Dhuhl bin Duman bin Jundub bin Kharijah bin Jadila bin Sa'd bin Tayy. Al-Hamdani said: The dwellings of Banu Lam are in the Two Mountains to Medina; they stay most of their times in the city of Yathrib. Then they multiplied and dispersed. Their clans separated from Haritha bin Lam, and his son Aws. They are the ones mentioned by Abu Tammam. Haritha bin Lam was one of the most physically complete people. From the clans of Lam is Banu Masruq clan, Banu Kindi clan, Banu Aws clan, and Atud clan. As for Aws, Ibn Al-Athir mentioned that he is Aws bin Khalid bin Haritha bin Lam. He was proverbial in virtue and generosity. His mother's name was Su'da bint Husayn Al-Ta'iyah; she was a lady, and Aws was a preeminent master. They mentioned that he and Hatim Al-Ta'i came as a delegation to Amr bin Hind, King of Al-Hira. He called Aws and said: \"Are you better or Hatim?\" He said: \"May you refuse the curse; if Hatim possessed me, myself and my children, it would not be strange.\" Then he called Hatim and said to him: \"Are you better or Aws?\" He said to him: \"May you refuse the curse; no one of his children is better than me. I was only mentioned because of Aws.\" Al-Nu'man bin Al-Mundhir had called for a robe, and he had a delegation of Arabs from every tribe. He said: \"Attend tomorrow; I will dress the best and most noble of you in this robe.\" They all attended except Aws. It was said to him: \"Why did you stay behind?\" He said: \"If another is intended, the most beautiful thing is that I am not present. And if I am intended, I will be sought.\" When Al-Nu'man sat, he did not see Aws. He said: \"Go to Aws and say to him: Attend safe from what you feared.\" So he attended, and he dressed him in the robe. His people envied him, so they said to Al-Hutay'ah: \"Satirize Aws and you shall have three hundred she-camels.\" He said: \"How can I satirize a man when in my house there are no provisions or goods except from him?\" Then he began to say: 'How can there be satire when a good deed... From the family of Lam continues to come to me in the unseen?' Then Bishr bin Abi Hazim from Banu Asad bin Khuzayma said to them: \"I will satirize him.\" So they gave him the camels. Ibn Al-Athir said: So he satirized him and mentioned his mother Su'da. When that reached Aws, he raided him and swept away the camels. Bishr fled to Banu Asad. He would not seek protection from anyone but they said: \"We grant you protection except from Aws.\" He took refuge with his clan Banu Asad, and they hated to surrender him to Aws. So Aws gathered his people Jadila and marched with them to them, catching them at the back of Al-Dahna. They fought a fierce battle, and Asad was defeated. Bishr fled and began not coming to a tribe seeking their protection except they refused. Then he stayed with Jundub bin Husayn Al-Kilabi. Aws sent to him demanding Bishr, so he sent him to Aws. When he was brought before Aws, his mother Su'da advised him to treat him well, return the camels to him, and pardon him. Aws said to him: \"O Bishr, what do you see me doing with you?\" Bishr recited verses of poetry praising Aws. So Aws returned his camels to him and gave him from his wealth one hundred she-camels. Bishr said: \"No doubt, I will praise no one but you until I die.\" The virtue of Aws among the Arabs is famous. It is recounted that Al-Harith bin Awf Al-Murri, master of Dhubyan, said one day to his brother Kharijah: \"Should I propose to anyone and he rejects me?\" He said: \"Yes, Aws bin Haritha bin Lam, master of Tayy.\" Al-Harith said to his servant: \"Journey with us to him.\" So Al-Harith, his brother Kharijah, and his servant journeyed. He said: We went out aiming for the land of Tayy, the road raising us at times, until we came to the dwellings of Tayy. We found Aws outside the neighborhood. He welcomed us and said: \"What brings you, O Haritha?\" He said: \"I came to you as a suitor.\" He said: \"You are not there (not suitable/accepted).\" And he turned away angry and did not speak to us, so we turned back returning.",

    "text": "Aws entered upon his wife angry. His wife was from Banu Abs. She said: \"Who is the man who came to you but did not stay, and you did not welcome him?\" He said: \"That is Al-Harith bin Awf Al-Murri, master of Dhubyan.\" She said: \"Why did you not ask him to dismount?\" He said: \"He considered me foolish, proposing (marriage) from me.\" She said: \"Why did you not marry him to one of your daughters, this master of the Arabs?\" She kept arguing with him until she said to him: \"Rectify what came from you, catch up with him and bring him back. Say to him: You met me while I was angry about a grave matter before your arrival. So return, and you shall have what you liked.\" Aws caught up with him, and Al-Harith returned happy. He entered upon his wife. He said: \"Call so-and-so, the eldest of his daughters.\" She came to him. He said: \"O daughter, this is Al-Harith bin Awf, a master of masters, who has come to us proposing. I wanted to marry you to him, so what do you say?\" She said: \"Do not do it,\" and excused herself with words, saying: \"There is some sharpness in my character. I am not his cousin so he might have mercy on me, nor a neighbor of yours so he might be shy of you.\" He said to her: \"May Allah bless you. Call so-and-so, your middle sister.\" He called her and said to her what he said to her elder sister. She replied to him like her elder sister said, and said: \"I am clumsy and my hand is not skilled. I am not safe from him seeing what he dislikes and divorcing me.\" He said: \"Rise, may Allah bless you. Call your youngest sister Buhaysah.\" He said to her like what he said to them. She said: \"It is up to you.\" He said: \"I offered it to your two sisters.\" She said: \"I am, by Allah, the beautiful in face, the skilled in hand, the gentle in character, the noble in father. If he divorces me, may Allah not replace it with good for him.\" He said: \"May Allah bless you.\" Then he returned to Al-Harith and married her to him. He gave her a dowry from his wealth of one hundred she-camels. He said to him: \"Do not spend the night single tonight.\" He ordered a tent to be set up for him, and she was brought in to him. Then Aws congratulated him and left. He said to her: \"Have you finished your affair (prepared)?\" She said: \"No, by Allah.\" He extended his hand to her. She said: \"Slowly! Among my father and brothers? This cannot be.\" Then he ordered departure, so they traveled. She said: \"Go forward and turn us away from the road.\" He turned from the road and made the camels kneel. Then he said to her: \"Have you finished your affair?\" She said: \"No, by Allah. As is done with the captured slave girl and the taken captive? No, by Allah, until camels are slaughtered, sheep are butchered, Arabs are invited, and what is done for the likes of me is done.\" So they traveled until they came to their land. He slaughtered camels and butchered sheep and entered upon her. He said: \"Have you finished your affair?\" She said: \"No, by Allah.\" He said: \"We have slaughtered camels and butchered sheep, and come near it.\" She said: \"No, by Allah. You have mentioned of honor what I do not see in you. Go out to these people: Abs and Dhubyan, and reconcile between them.\" He went out until he came to the people and walked between them with peace until they reconciled. He bore the blood money (Diyahs), which was three thousand camels over three years. He returned with the most beautiful mention. Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma said poetry about that. Then she bore him sons and daughters after that. This Aws was the head of Jadila; they were in Aja and Salma, the Two Mountains of Tayy. Then war broke out between Jadila and Al-Ghawth, which is the Day of Al-Yahamim, also known as the Raids of Huq. The reason was that Al-Harith bin Jabala Al-Ghassani had reconciled between Tayy. When he died, they returned to their war. Jadila and Al-Ghawth met at a place called Gharathat. The leader of Jadila, Asba' bin Amr bin Lam - who is the uncle of Aws bin Khalid bin Haritha bin Lam, and some genealogists drop Khalid and say Aws bin Haritha bin Lam - was killed. Mus'ab, a man from Sanbis, cut off the ear of Asba' bin Amr bin Lam and stitched his sandal with it, saying: 'We stitch our sandals with ears from you... And drink unwillingly from you in skulls.' The two clans exchanged many poems about that. What Al-Ghawth did became grave to Aws. He had not witnessed the previous wars, neither he nor any of the chiefs of Tayy like Hatim and Zayd al-Khayl. So Aws resolved to meet in war himself. He began gathering Jadila. News of Aws gathering reached Al-Ghawth, so fire was lit on the peak of Aja; that was the first day. The tribes of Ghawth approached with their chiefs over them, including Zayd al-Khayl and Hatim. Jadila approached gathered under Aws. Aws swore not to turn back from Tayy until he settled with them in their two mountains: Aja and Salma. They met in raids and fought a fierce battle. He said: The war turned against Banu Kayman bin Jundub bin Kharijah bin Jadila.",

    "text": "Adi bin Hatim said: \"I was standing on the Day of Al-Yahamim while the people were fighting, and Zayd al-Khayl was saying to his sons: 'Spare your people, for today is a day of annihilation. If these are paternal uncles, then those are maternal uncles.' I said: 'Did you hate killing your maternal uncles?' He said: His eyes turned red with anger, and he reached towards me, so I struck my horse and moved away from him. He remained waiting for his two sons. They came out like two falcons. Qays bin Azib charged at Bujayr bin Haritha bin Lam and struck him on his head a blow that made his horse stumble and he fled. So Jadila was defeated.\" Al-Ghalayini mentioned that victory was for Jadila over Al-Ghawth. Antara was in alliance with Jadila, and Al-Tha'alibah complained of him to Ghatafan. From Al-Mughira are clans of Banu Lam Al-Mughira. From them is Al-Mutirah bin Shaddad bin Aws bin Haritha bin Lam bin Amr bin Tarif bin Malik bin Amr bin Thumamah bin Malik bin Jad'a' bin Dhuhl bin Duman bin Jundub bin Kharijah bin Jadila bin Sa'd bin Qatrah bin Tayy. Al-Mughira was the most famous tribe of Tayy bin Lam, and the most numerous in clans. From them were famous kings; their last king was Ajl bin Hunaytam, discussion of whom will come. Then they moved from Najd to Iraq and Al-Sham. From them in Al-Jazira is Al-Ubayd, a clan of Al-Mughira. The chief of Al-Ubayd is Husayn Al-Ali; Al-Daylam joins them.

We have transmitted from Khalid bin Du'ayj and Abdullah bin Zamil, people of Marat, that Al-Rifa'i bin Ashwan traces his lineage to this. Al-Mughira established themselves in Najd after Banu Hilal as we will mention when mentioning Banu Hilal. The last king of Al-Mughira was Ajl bin Hunaytam. His residence was the town of Al-Sha'ra in Najd; the ruins of Ajl's palace remain to now. It was mentioned in the time of Mas'ud bin Abd Al-Aziz, may Allah have mercy on him, in the year 1200, that a man from the people of Samir passed by Imam Mas'ud. Imam Mas'ud said to the man: \"What is your age?\" He said: \"One hundred and twenty-four years.\" He said to him: \"From which tribes are you?\" He said: \"From the strongest tribe in Najd.\" He said to him: \"From Al-Mughira?\" He said: \"Yes, and the elder of the tribe was called Ajl.\" It is narrated that Banu Amir bin Sa'sa'ah imprisoned Ajl's brother, and they were at Al-Wafra. So he marched to them, killed them with a great slaughter, and freed his brother. It is said that Al-Bayhis was named by this name because of the abundance of horses and army in this raid that crushed (bahhasat) with their hooves and pads. It is said they were besieged in one of the raids, and the valley became narrow for them despite its wideness. From the clans of Al-Mughira among the settled people in Najd are Al-Suwalim, who are remnants of Ajl. From them are Al-Humud, inhabitants of the town of Dharma.

The first to move from Al-Uyaynah were Abdullah and his brother Sulayman, sons of Musa bin Ahmad bin Husayn bin Imran Al-Shukhayl. They settled in Al-Ahsa in the year one thousand and eighty Hijri. To Abdullah was born Husayn. To Husayn was born three children: Salih, Salim, and Sulayman. To Sulayman was born: Abd Al-Latif and Muhammad, then they perished.",

O my sons: No betrayer ever succeeded, no traitor led a day of time, the generous never lived but praised, nor died poor. I know nothing more humiliating than miserliness, nor weaker than the solitary individual.\" It is mentioned that Muawiyah the Elder, grandfather of the Crowned Kings of Kinda, advised his sons, saying: \"O my sons, excel in befriending those who befriend you, and opposing those who oppose you. Be snakes in front of your enemy and behind him, and lions on his right and left. Raid him at night when it covers, and plunder him in the day when it reveals. For his leaving you is not out of pity for you, but waiting for an opportunity against you. As for the one who befriends you, tend to his night, preserve his day, be for him a shining morning and a preventing pillar. The least of his right you must fulfill is to prefer him with good over yourselves, and shield him from evil with yourselves.\" They have many poems on that, left for brevity.

    "text": "They are Banu Ishmael son of Abraham, peace be upon them. They were named by this name because when Abraham, peace be upon him, settled in Honored Mecca, he stayed with the Second Jurhum, who are from Banu Qahtan. Al-Suyuti mentioned it in his book and said: The age of Ishmael, peace be upon him, when his father settled him in Mecca as narrated, was fourteen years. That was two thousand seven hundred and ninety-three years before the Hijra. Ishmael married a woman from Jurhum and learned Arabic from them. She bore him twelve children. Ibn Ishaq and other genealogists said: To Yashjub bin Ya'rub was born Yatrah, to Yatrah Nahor, to Nahor Muqawwim, to Muqawwim Udad, and to Udad Adnan. This is weak. There has been much difference among genealogists regarding the duration and number. The truth is that the duration is much longer than what the latter mentioned. In summary, the guardianship of the House was with Banu Ishmael, and its keys in their hands, until Jurhum overcame them in that and seized the House after Nabit. Regarding that, Amir Al-Harith Al-Jurhumi says poetry: 'We were the guardians of the House after Nabit... Circumambulating that House, and the matter is apparent. We ruled so we became mighty, so how great was our rule... For there is no tribe other than us there boasting. Did you not marry from the best person I knew... So his sons are from us and we are the in-laws.' Until he said: 'As if there was not between Al-Hajun to Al-Safa... Any companion, and no one conversed by night in Mecca.' This poem is long, said by Mudad Al-Jurhumi after Khuza'a overcame Jurhum and took the keys of the House from them. They remained in their hands until they passed to Ghayshan. He got drunk one day, so Qusay bought the keys of the House from him for a skin of wine. Thus the proverb ran: \"A worse deal than the transaction of Abu Ghayshan.\" The news of this story is famous. Since that is established, Adnan is the branching point of the lineage of the Arabized Arabs, from whom its tribes, clans, bellies, thighs, and virtues branched. It was mentioned in Al-Ibar and others: All existing descendants of Ishmael are from the lineage of Adnan. To Adnan was born Ma'ad. To Ma'ad was born Nizar, as came in Al-Ibar. The homelands of Banu Adnan are exclusive to Najd, and they are all nomadic travelers, except Quraysh in Mecca. Al-Suhayli said: No one from Qahtan shares the land of Najd with Banu Adnan except Tayy from Kahlan. He said: Then Banu Adnan dispersed in Tihama of Hijaz, then in Iraq and the Jazira Euphrates region, then they dispersed after Islam to the regions. The famous children of Nizar bin Ma'ad bin Adnan are four: Mudar, Rabi'ah, Iyad, and Anmar. From Banu Mudar, most Adnanite tribes branched out. They are Banu Ilyas bin Mudar and Banu Qays Aylan bin Mudar, whose name is Al-Nas. Khandaf is the name of Ilyas's wife; his sons were known by her. Ilyas had children: Mudrikah on the column of lineage, Tabikha, and Qam'ah. Mudrikah begot Khuzayma and Hudhayl. Khuzayma bin Mudrikah begot Kinana, father of the famous tribes, and Asad, father of Banu Asad. Kinana begot Al-Nadr; Al-Nadr begot Malik; Malik begot Fihr. He is Fihr bin Malik bin Al-Nadr bin Kinana. In him the lineage of Quraysh gathers entirely. Quraysh is a title for him; likened to a beast in the sea called Quraysh (Shark), or for other reasons. The gatherer of Quraysh is Fihr; whoever is below Fihr is Quraysh, and whoever is above him is Arab like Kinana, Asad, and others from the tribes of Mudar. From Fihr the tribes of Quraysh branched out. The famous among them are seventeen clans: Banu Hashim, Banu Al-Muttalib, Banu Nawfal, Banu Abd Shams - these are four. Banu Abd Manaf bin Qusay bin Kilab. Banu Abd Al-Dar, Banu Asad bin Abd Al-Uzza - these three are brothers of Abd Manaf bin Qusay bin Kilab. Banu Zuhrah bin Kilab brother of Qusay bin Kilab. Banu Tamim and Banu Makhzum bin Yaqazah - they are brothers of Kilab bin Murrah bin Ka'b. Banu Adi, Banu Sahm, Banu Jumah - brothers of Murrah bin Ka'b bin Lu'ayy. Banu Amir brother of Ka'b - they are sons of Lu'ayy bin Ghalib bin Fihr. Banu Al-Harith and Banu Muharib brothers of Ghalib bin Fihr bin Malik bin Al-Nadr. Banu Tamim bin Ghalib - from them is Abdullah bin Khatal whose blood was shed with impunity on the Day of Conquest. From Banu Muharib bin Fihr bin Malik are Al-Dahhak bin Qays Al-Fihri, Habib bin Salamah, and Dirar bin Al-Khattab, the horseman and poet of Quraysh. He converted on the Day of Conquest. He is the one saying: 'O Prophet of Guidance, to you sought refuge... The tribe of Quraysh, and you are the best refuge. When the vastness of the earth narrowed upon them... And the Lord of Heaven became their enemy. Indeed Sa'd wants a back-breaking calamity... Upon the people of Al-Hajun and Al-Batha'. A Khazraji, if he could out of rage... He would throw at us eagles and barking dogs.'",

    "text": "The Abbasid Caliphs are from the descendants of Abdullah, the Ink of the Nation, may Allah be pleased with him. The first of them to assume the Caliphate was Abu Al-Abbas Al-Saffah. His name is Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Ubayd Allah bin Al-Abbas. The Second Clan of Banu Hashim: The Talibids. They are Banu Abi Talib. Ibn Ishaq said: His name is Abd Manaf.

From the Talibids are the Ja'farids (Al-Ja'afirah), who are Banu Ja'far bin Abi Talib. Ja'far had: Muhammad and Abdullah. Abdullah bin Ja'far was the most generous of people, such that the people of Medina used to incur debts based on (expectation of) his arrival during the season. It says in Al-Ibar: From the descendants of this Abdullah is Abdullah bin Muawiyah bin Abdullah bin Ja'far; he rose in Fars and was pledged allegiance for the Caliphate at the end of the Umayyad state. From the Talibids: The Alawids (Al-Alawiyun). They are the children of the Commander of the Faithful Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him. Judge Al-Tabari said: He had thirteen male children: Al-Hasan, Al-Husayn, Amr, Talha, Yahya, Al-Sajjad, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Musa, Zakariya, and Yusuf. Offspring came from six: Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, Al-Sajjad, Yahya, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Musa, and Zakariya. Al-Quda'i in 'Banu Al-Abbas' said, citing Al-Tabari: Lineage continued in five: Al-Hasan, Al-Husayn, Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, Amr, and Al-Abbas. Most Alawid lineage returns to Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn and their descendants, and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. Then the famous of the Alawids: The Hassanids (Al-Hasaniyun).

They are Banu Idris bin Abdullah bin Hasan Al-Muthanna bin Al-Hasan. They had a kingdom in the Far Maghreb. Idris was the first to rule, then his son Idris ruled after him; he is the one who built the city of Fez in the Far Maghreb. Then they had a kingdom after that in Andalusia. From them are the Idrisids people of Yemen. From them are the Sulaymanids (Al-Sulaymaniyun); they were Emirs of Mecca, deputies of the Abbasid Caliphs. They are Banu Sulayman bin Dawud bin Al-Hasan Al-Muthanna bin Al-Hasan. It says in Al-Ibar: The Abbasids did not cease to be over Mecca until the time of Al-Musta'in, then it went to Banu Sulayman this one. He said: Their elder was Muhammad bin Sulayman. From them are the Hawashim (Al-Hawashim). They are Banu Abi Hashim bin Muhammad bin Al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Musa bin Abdullah bin Abi Al-Karam bin Musa Al-Jawn bin Abdullah bin Al-Hasan Al-Muthanna bin Al-Hasan Al-Sibt.

The first to rule among them was Muhammad bin Ja'far bin Abi Hashim mentioned, and it remained in them. From them are Banu Qatada, called Banu Dawud Qatada. They are Banu Qatada bin Idris bin Mata'in bin Abd Al-Karim bin Musa bin Musa bin Abdullah bin Abi Al-Karam bin Musa Al-Jawn bin Abdullah bin Al-Hasan Al-Muthanna. He possessed Mecca from the hands of the Hawashim after possessing Yanbu, Al-Safra, Yemen, and the land of Najd. He died in the year 610. The Emirate of Mecca remained in his descendants, then went to Banu Ajlan bin Rumaythah bin Abi Numay bin Abi Sa'id bin Ali bin Qatada. It settled finally in the sons of his son Al-Hasan, and the family of his brother's son Rumaythah bin Muhammad bin Ajlan until the year 818, and the matter is upon that. From Banu Qatada are the Emirs of Yanbu from Banu Al-Hasan bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them both.

It remained in their hands until the Sulaymanids, Emirs of Mecca, overcame when the Hawashim expelled them from it. Then it returned in the year 793.

From the clans of the Alawids from Banu Husayn the Grandson are Al-Ja'afirah. They are Banu Ja'far Al-Sadiq bin Muhammad Al-Baqir bin Ali Zayn Al-Abidin bin Al-Hasan the Grandson [sic, should be Al-Husayn]. This Ja'far is one of the Twelve Imams according to those who hold that the Imams are twelve, starting with Ali bin Abi Talib may Allah be pleased with him, then his son Al-Hasan may Allah be pleased with him, then his brother Al-Husayn may Allah be pleased with him, then his son Ali Al-Sajjad, then his son Al-Baqir, then Ja'far Al-Sadiq, then his son Musa Al-Kazim, then his son Ali Al-Rida, then his son Al-Muttaqi [Muhammad Al-Jawad], then his son Ali Al-Taqi [Ali Al-Hadi], then his son Al-Zaki Al-Hasan [Al-Askari], then his son Muhammad Al-Hujjah, called Al-Qa'im, who is the twelfth; they believe in his life and await his emergence. He had children: Musa Al-Kazim and Muhammad Al-Dibajah. From the descendants of Al-Kazim is his son Ali Al-Rida, whom Al-Ma'mun made Crown Prince of the Caliphate, and he died in Al-Ma'mun's life.

From them are Al-Tahir, Emirs of the Prophet's City (Medina). They are from the descendants of Zayd the Jurist, from descendants of Al-Hasan bin Ja'far Hujjat Allah, from descendants of Ja'far bin Abdullah bin Al-Hasan the Grandson. In the year 799, it was in the hand of Thabit bin Hamadah bin Qasim bin Muhanna bin Al-Hasan bin Dawud bin Abdullah bin Tahir bin Yahya mentioned previously. Then it transferred after him to his cousins until it came to Aziz bin Hayazi'. These Banu Al-Husayn are Emirs of Medina; their followers are all Rafidah (Shia), but they do not declare that openly out of fear. The remnants of Banu Al-Husayn are dispersed with their cousins Banu Al-Hasan. From them are Al-Barraqi, Shia, and their dwelling is the village of Al-Tuwaythir of the villages of Al-Ahsa. As for Banu Ja'far inhabitants of Khaybar, they are from the descendants of Ja'far bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him. Khaybar possessed palms, crops, and rivers.

From them is Banu Isa bin Baghild, and Dhubyan bin Baghild, between whom the Great War occurred because of the horse of Qays bin Zuhayr, owner of the horse known as Dahis, which raced with Al-Ghabra', and the war was because of it. From them is Antara Al-Absi known for bravery. It says in Al-Ibar: None of them remain in Najd now. He said: In the tribes of Raghbah in the Maghreb are those attributed to Abs; I do not know if it is this Abs or another Abs from Raghbah Dhubyan? He said: Dhubyan bin Baghild bin Rayth bin Ghatafan. Abu Ubayd said: He had children: Sa'd, Fazara, and Haribah. He said: They are a clan from Banu Tha'labah bin Sa'd. Amir is in Banu Yashkur, and Salman in Banu Abs.",

    "text": "It is said: Al-Shararat are from the remnants of Abs. It is said from its remnants are Al-Haddabun known in Banu Abdullah. It says in Al-Ibar: He had children: Murrah, Tha'labah, and Fazara. These are Banu Dhubyan. From Banu Dhubyan is Fazara. He had children: Mazin and Adi. Their poet says about them: 'Fazara is the House of Glory and Glory is in them... Fazara of Qays, the lineage of Qays is its defense. It has the unyielding might and the lineage which... Its men built for Qays in ancient times.' It says in Al-Ibar: The dwellings of Fazara were in Najd and Wadi Al-Qura. None of them remain in Najd now. Tayy settled in their dwellings. He said: In the land of Barqa to Tripoli are tribes of them. Informants from the people of Barqa informed me of several of their tribes. They are: Subh, Dhu Nafar, and many of them are Awlad Muhammad, Al-Jama'ah, Al-Hassasnah, Al-Sha'ub, Al-Aqibat, Al-Awasi, Al-Alawi, Al-Ghashashimah, Al-Qabus, Al-Lawahig, Al-Masawirah, Al-Ma'aymir, Al-Mawahid, Al-Mawaris, and Al-Namasah. It says in Al-Ibar: In Ifriqiya and the Maghreb are many tribes of them mixed with its people. From them is a group in Al-Ma'qil in the Far Maghreb. From them is a faction in the land of La'a and Waklah; they are two villages inside the desert. A faction of them came from Barqa and what follows it to the Egyptian lands. They settled at the outskirts of Al-Bahnasa towards Al-Jazira. Al-Hamdani said: By them the ruins of Fazara in the land of Qalyubiyya are known. From Banu Fazara: Banu Mazin; their dwellings are Qalyubiyya of the Egyptian lands. This is the last of what Allah facilitated.

    "text": "This is a clarification of the knowledge of the children of Ibrahim bin Mani' bin Ibrahim bin Hamdan bin Muhammad bin Mani' bin Shabarmah Al-Wuhaybi Al-Tamimi. He had children: Two, Muhammad, and Ibrahim named after his father because his father died while he was in his mother's womb. As for Muhammad bin Ibrahim, he had three children: Abdullah, Abd Al-Karim, and Abd Al-Aziz nicknamed Quray'. As for Abdullah, he died in the town of Ushayqir on the fifteenth of Dhu al-Hijjah year one thousand two hundred and forty-eight. He had two sons: Sheikh Muhammad inhabitant of the town of Unayzah, and Hamad inhabitant of the town of Shaqra. Hamad died in Shaqra and has no offspring. Sheikh Muhammad died in Unayzah on the night of Sunday the nineteenth of Jumada al-Akhira year one thousand two hundred and ninety-one. He had several children, among them Sheikh Abd Al-Rahman who died in Al-Ahsa in Rabi' al-Awwal year one thousand two hundred and eighty-seven and his line ended. Among them is Sheikh Abd Al-Aziz; his birth was the night of Monday 29 of Safar year one thousand two hundred and sixty-three. He assumed the judiciary in Unayzah and died there on the twenty-seventh of Jumada al-Ula year one thousand three hundred and seven. When he died, one of his students eulogized him saying: 'Sweet sleep is far from the eye, distant... So constantly tears pour from it. Like the state of a sick or healthy man among people... Who took poison soaking into the heart. If it is said the sea of knowledge and generosity has settled... Enclosed by a grave and empty deserts. The ally of piety Abd Al-Aziz bin Mani'... Imam of guidance hastening to noble deeds. A knowledgeable Imam, precise and verifier... Brother of trust in transmission and speech, brilliant. If the intelligent scholar hears his speech... A knowledge appearing from him, vast, confuses him.' And from it: 'Judgments with clear truth all of them... Before him, the lowly and the high are equal.' And from it: 'Scholars acknowledged his knowledge and piety... So all are obedient and listening to what he judges. If judgment baffles every judge and scholar... And a reality confronts them in their affair. I found for it a decisive chapter with the Sheikh... A light from clear truth shines for it.' To the end of the useful poem. He had several male children who died, and none remained except Muhammad. Muhammad has three male children: Abd Al-Aziz, Abd Al-Rahman, and Ahmad. From them is Abdullah bin Sheikh Muhammad, who is now in Unayzah, then died after that in the year one thousand three hundred and sixty. He assumed the judiciary of Unayzah for about ten years after the death of Judge Salih bin Uthman Al-Qadi, who held the judiciary of Unayzah for nearly twenty-seven years. This judge, Allah gave him knowledge, forbearance, and generosity; he is one of the intelligent, achieving students of Sheikh Abd Al-Aziz bin Muhammad Al-Mani'. Sheikh Muhammad had several children other than those we mentioned, and they died having no offspring. These are the children of Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Mani'. As for his brother Abd Al-Karim bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Mani', he had a son named Abdullah, and Abdullah died. He had two sons: Salih and Abd Al-Aziz. As for Salih, he died in Al-Ahsa and left no offspring. As for Abd Al-Aziz, he is now in Ushayqir \"at the time of writing this lineage\", but he died. As for his second brother Abd Al-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Mani' nicknamed Quray', he is a resident of the town of Shaqra. His children are three: Abdullah, Ibrahim, and Sa'd. As for Abdullah, he had two sons: Abd Al-Muhsin and Abd Al-Aziz. Abd Al-Muhsin died in Al-Ahsa and has no offspring. Abd Al-Aziz died in Shaqra and left only a daughter. As for Ibrahim bin Abd Al-Aziz, he married Aisha bint Abd Al-Rahman bin Mani' in Al-Ahsa and died in Al-Ahsa leaving only females. As for Sa'd bin Abd Al-Aziz, he had a son named Fahd in Al-Ahsa, and I do not know today any of his descendants other than him. These are the children of Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Mani' bin Ibrahim bin Hamdan bin Muhammad bin Mani'. As for the brother of the mentioned Muhammad, he is Ibrahim bin Ibrahim named after his father. His children are five: Hamad, Muhammad nicknamed Al-Awd (The Elder), Abd Al-Aziz, Sulayman, and Abd Al-Karim. As for Hamad bin Ibrahim, he had three children: Ibrahim and Muhammad, both residents of Unayzah, and Abdullah nicknamed Arayj, who is in Ushayqir. As for Muhammad nicknamed Al-Awd, he had a son named Sulayman; Sulayman died, and he had a son named Ibrahim. They are now \"at the time of recording this lineage\" in the town of Al-Jahra in the works of Kuwait.",

    "text": "As for Abd Al-Aziz and Sulayman, they have no offspring. As for Abd Al-Karim bin Ibrahim, he lived in Shaqra and died. He has a son in Shaqra named Muhammad nicknamed Akhina (Our Brother). These are the children of Ibrahim named after his father: Ibrahim bin Mani' bin Ibrahim bin Hamdan bin Muhammad bin Mani' bin Shabarmah Al-Wuhaybi Al-Tamimi. End of what the investigative scholar Sheikh Ibrahim bin Salih bin Isa, famous in the Najdi lands for knowledge of lineage, mentioned, so he became the reference in it when there is doubt. We have inserted here some words for further clarification and explanation due to the distance in time between the previous and subsequent writing. May Allah bless Muhammad and his family and grant them peace. Third Benefit: Know that Al-Wahbah are united by Muhammad bin Alawi bin Wahib. He had two sons: Zakhir and Muhammad. Muhammad was named after his father because his father died while he was a fetus, so he was named after his father. Zakhir bin Muhammad bin Alawi is the grandfather of Al-Bassam bin Munif, Al-Bassam bin Asakir, Al-Bassam bin Uqbah, Al-Musharraf, Al-Rayayisah, and Al-Rajih. As for Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Alawi, he is the grandfather of Al-Khurfan and Al-Shabarmah. And Al-Mani', among whom is Muhammad bin Mani' the famous scholar. I say: He has a mention in Majmu' Al-Manqur, and he was in the time of Sheikh Sulayman bin Ali. He gave a fatwa in a famous ruling agreed upon by Sulayman Ali, grandfather of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abd Al-Wahhab. End. From Al-Muhammad is Shabanah, grandfather of Al-Ibn Nasir. Among those attached to Al-Ibn Nasir are Al-Aydan; from them are Al-Abi Hasan, Al-Shiha, Al-Luhayb, Al-Qasari, and Al-Musnad. And Allah knows best. This is what I copied from the handwriting of one who copied it from the handwriting of the historian Sheikh Ibrahim bin Salih bin Isa. End. By the pen of Muhammad bin Abd Al-Aziz bin Mani', may Allah bless Muhammad and his family and grant them peace. The one in need of Allah Almighty, Muhammad bin Abd Al-Aziz bin Mani', says: This is the last of what we found of this useful book. It appears from his work that he did not complete it, but what we mentioned is extremely useful. We saw fit to append to it, like a conclusion, three benefits authored by the scholar historian Sheikh Ibrahim bin Salih bin Isa, who died in Unayzah in the year one thousand three hundred and forty-three. One of them is in mentioning the thighs of Al-Wahbah and their dispersion in the lands, among whom are Al-Ma'adid, the clan of Sheikh Ali Al Thani, printer of the book. The second is in mentioning a thigh of Al-Wahbah, clarifying the children of Ibrahim Ibn Al-Mani'. The third is regarding who unites Al-Wahbah, who is Muhammad bin Alawi bin Wahib. Praise be to Allah first and last, and blessings and peace upon His Chosen Prophet and his family until the Day of Judgment.",
