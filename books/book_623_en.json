    "text": "Introduction\nIn the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe days of our Master, the Supported King, the Knowledgeable, the Just, the Guided, the Patron of Blessings, Abu al-Abbas Khwarazm Shah - may Allah Almighty perpetuate his authority and guard his glory and status - are the times of honor and virtue. His times are the chronicles of generosity and glory. His hours are the seasons of literature and knowledge. His breaths are blessings. His sayings are yes (approval). His actions are biographies. His traces are blazes (highlights). His words are pearls. His lofty traits vie with the stars in height. His generosities rival the atmosphere in vastness. His beauties compete with the sun in brightness. His virtues race with the rain in abundance. So may Allah perpetuate the beauty of time by his survival, and the perfection of glory and elevation by his splendor, and rain justice and benevolence throughout the length of his period, and divert evil from his soul.\nWhen the High Command - may it remain effective and high, and a decreed destiny - came out to his servant created for his service, named Abd al-Malik for the servitude of his presence, regarding \"Scattering the Verse and Untying the Knots\" from the selected poetry contained in the book titled 'Mu'nis al-Udaba' (The Companion of the Literati), the servant took it as a Qibla to pray towards, and a foundation to build upon. He turned to prose, which is nobler, and in the path of kings and great men, more golden. Its companions are better, and their gatherings are higher. The ranks of scribes (writers) have always been and will always be elevated above the ranks of poets. For scribes, being the tongues of kings, only correspond regarding collecting tax, or fortifying a frontier, or building a land, or reforming corruption, or inciting to jihad, or arguing against a faction, or consoling in a calamity, or similar great matters and significant affairs, in which they need to be possessors of much etiquette and diverse knowledge. The service of kings has marked them with its honor, and settled them in the dwellings of its leadership. Their dangers are high according to the height of the danger of what they delve into and go towards.\nPoets, however, their purposes which they aim for and their goals which they run towards are describing dwellings and ruins, mentioning homelands and yearning for desires, and flirting with women, then asking and begging, and praising and satirizing. Because of the low status of poetry, Prophets - peace be upon them - are protected from it, and Kings are elevated above them. Allah Almighty said to the most noble of His creation and His trustee over His revelation: \"And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it befitting for him.\"\nWhen Imru' al-Qais began reciting poetry and his poetry reached his father, King Hujr, he disdained it from him, rebuked him, admonished him, and scolded him lest he return to its like. When he saw that he would not desist, he ordered his killing. The servant ordered with that protected him, spared him, and hid him, then informed Hujr of his deed and guaranteed Imru' al-Qais's repentance from his poetry.\nIt was said to Yahya ibn Khalid al-Barmaki: \"Why do you not recite poetry?\" He said: \"Its devil is more malicious than for me to give him power over my mind, and there is no good in something whose best is its most lying.\"\nAbu Muslim, the owner of the state, used to say: \"Beware of poetry, for it satirizes its companion at the slightest slip, and seeks for lying the highest reward.\"\nAbd al-Samad ibn al-Mu'adhdhal expressed clearly the reality of the situation regarding the degradation of the poet's rank due to his busying himself with the opposite of right guidance, where he said to Abu Tammam when he intended Basra and overlooked it:\n\"You are between two things you present to people... And both of them are with a humiliated face.\nYou do not cease seeking a union... From a beloved or seeking a gift.\nWhat water remains for your free face... Between the humiliation of passion and the humiliation of asking?\"\nWhen the verses reached Abu Tammam, he said: \"He spoke the truth, by Allah, and did well.\" He turned his rein away from Basra and swore never to enter it.\nRegarding weariness with the craft of poetry, Abu Sa'id al-Makhzumi says:\n\"The dog and the poet are in a state... Oh, would that I were not a poet.\nDo you not see him extending his palm... Asking for food from the comer and the goer?\"\nAnd the most poetic of the people of Isfahan, Abu Sa'id al-Rustami, said:\n\"I left poetry to the poets because I... Saw poetry as worthless goods.\"\nI have made this book titled \"Scattering the Verse and Untying the Knots\" into letters and chapters, most of them adorned with the High Name - may Allah establish it as long as days and nights last. I hoped not to fall short of the saying of Al-Sahib Abu al-Qasim Isma'il ibn Abbad:\n\"Indeed, untying poetry is the rank of a scribe... But among them is one who unties and then ties.\"\n\nChapter\nThe Virtues of Scribes\nAnd their Praiseworthy Qualities and Descriptions of their Traces\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Abu Dulaf al-Ijli\"\n\"A people, if they fear the enmity of an envier... They shed blood with the tips of pens.\nAnd indeed, a strike from a scribe with his ink... Is sharper and more penetrating than the edge of a sword.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"A people, if they take pens for a purpose... Then draw with them the water of death.\nThey attain with them from their enemies, even if many... What is not attained by the edge of Mashrafi swords.\"",

    "text": "Being hostile to scribes is not among the actions of those with intellect. Disputing with them is regret, making peace with them is safety, and befriending them is a benefit and a cold spoil (easy gain). What do you think of a people who possess the reins of wishes and deaths with the beauty of their speech, and preach on the pulpits of virtue with the tongues of their pens, and shed the blood of enemies with the tips of their pens? Of old, their writings sufficed instead of battalions, and the traces of their hands stood in for sharp swords. Great gifts and talents flowed on their fingertips. In the blackness of their ink is the whiteness of blessings and the redness of blood. In it, at times, is the spirit of life, and at others, the poison of vipers. Sometimes the sweetness of honey, and sometimes the bitterness of colocynth. One day the reward of bliss, and one day the punishment of Hell. That is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills, and Allah is the Possessor of Great Bounty.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Sahib\"\n\"By Allah, tell me, is the paper you write on... From a suit it is, or did you dress it in suits?\nBy Allah, did this word of yours flow from honey... Or did you pour honey on your words?\"\nAnd the saying of Abu al-Fath al-Busti:\n\"If he draws his pens one day to work them... He makes you forget every brave warrior shaking his spear.\nAnd if he decides upon the parchment of his fingertips... The scribes of mankind admit slavery to him.\"\nI do not know, my master, is your handwriting spread brocade, or is your word gathered honey? So by Allah, tell me, is your paper from a suit it is, or did you dress it in suits? And did your words flow from honey, or did you pour honey on them? By Allah, you, when you took the pen, nullified every hero who shakes spears and draws swords. And when you ran it on the parchment of your fingertips, the scribes of mankind admitted slavery to you. How excellent you are when your pearls scatter and your magic multiplies. You alerted to your word every alertness, and your speech was precise and exalted above similars, and resembled the presence of the King Khwarazm Shah. For it is, by Allah, the plan of beauties and the garden of blessings. May that presence not cease to be green and fresh, cited as a proverb in beauty, and to which the attributes of security and prosperity end.\n\n\"Another on the Saying of Abu al-Fath\"\n\"May I be the ransom of the one who gifted me his book... So he gifted me the world along with religion in a scroll.\nA book whose meanings within its lines are... Pearls in a drawer, stars in a constellation.\"\nAnd his saying also:\n\"Your book, my master, cleared my worries... And by it my envy and joy settled.\nA book in whose secrets is joy... Its whisperer is saved from sorrows.\nHow many a wondrous meaning whose word was inserted... There, paired any pairing!\nLike wine in glass, rather like a spirit... That flowed in a body of moderate temperament.\"\nMay I be the ransom of the one who gifted me his precious book, and presented me with his intimate address. So it was as if he gifted me the world and religion in a scroll, and pearls of beauty in a drawer, and stars of happiness in my constellation. No wonder that it freed me from the slavery of my worries, and cleared from me the clouds of my griefs. So joy settled by it, and disturbance departed with it. What do you think of a noble book, containing general virtue and massive gain? Its exterior is a rained-upon garden and scattered pearls. Its secret is joy and abundant companion. It saves its owner from sorrows and reconciles between him and time. How many a subtle meaning in it, in a noble word! How similar they are in pairing to nothing but pure wine in pure glass, or to the body of ivory in the doctrine of brocade, or to the subtle spirit in a body of moderate temperament, or to the mirror in which the beautiful face and the pretty countenance are seen, and to good creation adorned by good character and sweet nature, and to the gathering of the bright appearance to the illuminating, splendid, pleasing substance. All this, my master, is belittled beside your book, unique in your beautiful manners. But I say it is as if from the presence of the Great King Khwarazm Shah, the Patron of Blessings - may Allah strengthen his victory - arriving, and from the chest of his kingdom issuing. It is shining with the light of his assembly, and fragrant from the breeze of his glory. No wonder that the hand gathers from it white crystal, the Black Stone, red sulfur, green life, and the kingdom of the Banu al-Asfar (Romans/Byzantines). I ask Allah to protect you from the eye of your perfection, and make your days your mounts to your hopes.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz regarding Al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah\"\n\"A pen, I do not know what I see, or a celestial body... Running with what Qasim wills and traveling.\nKneeling, prostrating, kissing a papyrus... As a grateful one kissed the carpet.\nAnd great of meaning, precise, subtle... And of many actions while it is small.\nHow many gifts and how many deaths and how much life... And death do those lines contain!\nEngraved in the darkness as daylight, so I do not know... Is it writing in them or depiction?\"",

    "text": "Is it a cutting sword, or a shining lightning, or a rotating celestial body, or a moving pen? It runs with what our Master the King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah perpetuate his kingdom - wills, starting and returning. It serves his will kneeling and prostrating, and kisses his papyrus as the thankful one kisses his carpet. It opens for him the doors of fruitful, pleasing gardens, as his command opens the fortresses of closed lands. It is the precise of appearance, the great of meaning, the small of shape, the large of action, the near of voice, the far of fame. How many deaths and gifts does what he wrote contain, and how many blessings and punishments issue from what he imports and exports! Oh what a magician of the soul by the soul! He plants rubies and pearls in the land of the parchment, and embroiders the cloak of the sun with darkness. Glory be to Him who taught by the pen, taught man what he knew not. He, the Mentioned, is asked to look after religion and the world by prolonging the survival of our Master and perpetuating his days, and subjugating time by the scratching of his pens and the clashing of his sword. As long as the papyrus laughs with the weeping of the pen, and the night of desire whitens from the day of judgment.\n\nChapter\nOn the Pen\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"Deaf, hearing, stationary, moving... It attains the massive things of highness while it is lean.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"And a mute, eloquent one, thin from illness... It is healthy throughout time and sick.\nGreat, dangerous, people know that it is... Little, despised, may be humiliated and honored.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"I remained weeping over them while by my side... Was one adorned with the ornament of lovers.\nSlender of body as if the hand of Time... Fed it from them with a cup filled to the brim.\nSharpened in its tongue for gifts... And deaths, a spit of saliva spilled.\"\nAnd the saying of Al-Mutanabbi:\n\"Thin of the journey, running on the crown of its head... And it goes barefoot, so its running strengthens when it is cut.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"And a mute one speaking decisive words... While its body is silent, hollow.\nIn Mecca it speaks in secret... And in Sham its speech is known.\"\nAnd other descriptions of the pen and its characteristics from the book 'Mu'nis al-Udaba' and others, which the book speaks by citing all of it. The beginning of the letter is in the way of a riddle and its end in his high mention. May Allah establish it as long as days and nights last.\nWhat is deaf, mute, eloquent, weak, strong, despised, mighty, thin of body, great of action, slender of person, fat of danger, insignificant of appearance, famous of substance, light of burden, heavy of impact, small of size, great of crime? It gathers the descriptions of lovers in slenderness, yellowness, and spilled tears. It imitates the actions of Time in benefit and harm, and combining honey and colocynth, and mixing gain with debt, and kingship with destruction. It runs with misfortunes and fortunes between standing and sitting. It decrees joy and misery when the papyrus laughs with weeping. It judges cases, deaths, and gifts, riding five mounts. In one of its teeth is the spit of the viper injecting it, and in the other the saliva of the bee ejecting it. In one of its sides is the falling affliction and the effective poison, and in the other the beneficial medicine and the comprehensive cure. If it tires and dulls and fails and ails, its head is cut off so it returns healthy and speaks eloquently. As if it were the candle, its glory in its humiliation, and its life in its killing. Among its characteristics is that it speaks in secret in the East, so what it secreted of logic is known in the West. Among its subtleties is that it reveals the conscience and obtains what is in the chests, and divides people between graves and palaces.\nI will not prolong upon you, my master, by mentioning its wonders and benefits and describing its returns and habits. It is the pen by which Allah taught first, and swore by last, and made it the scribe of His revelation and the tongue of His command and prohibition. Sciences are from its traces, literatures are from its fruits, and swords and spears are from its servants. There is none of us but bearing its blessings and vengeances.\nHow excellent it is as a brother who rose to the sky of virtue, and the orbit of glory, and the spring of generosity from the hand of our Master the Great King Khwarazm Shah, the Patron of Blessings - may Allah perpetuate his authority and establish his pillars. So it began serving his high thought, and standing as he wills at his command, and extracting the pearls of his nature from the sea of his knowledge, and setting them as a crown on the parting of his time. There is beauty in its entirety, perfection in its totality, eloquence in its comprehensiveness, and skill in its best exhibitions. There is the free speech from which the water of honor drips, and upon which the ray of generosity shines. How many a signature of his possesses the slavery of beauty and beneficence, and falls in the place of water for the thirsty. May Allah protect our Master from the eye of perfection and the calamities of time. And may the traces of his high hand never cease to be a Qibla to which prayers of magnification are directed, and upon which the circumambulation of reverence and presentation is stopped. Amen, O Allah, Amen.\n\nChapter\nNoble Deeds and Generosity\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Abdullah ibn Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, may Allah Almighty be pleased with him\"\n\"And I am not competing for money by nature... But I compete for high ranks.\nI love that people be below me... Throughout time in the nobility of deeds.\nNo, by Allah, I never loved money... For anything at all except for giving.\nI benefit and people benefit from me... And what remains comes to demise.\"\nWhoever competed for wealth so its resources expand, its supplies continue, its numbers abound, and increases with the speaking (livestock) acquiring its kinds, and the silent (gold/silver) choking its bags, then I compete for high ranks and noble deeds. I see bearing debts as one of the greatest gains. I do not care except for comforting the free and snatching them from the claws of treacherous Time. I love that people be below me in good deeds and praiseworthy qualities. And by Allah, the highest of oaths and the loftiest in the conditions of faith, I do not love money except to spend it and be generous with it to its people. I believe that what I give remains and lasts forever, and what I keep perishes and runs out.\nHow can I not be so when I am among the servants of a King who is Glory created as a soul, and Generosity represented as a person? He has an ambition in generosity that removes Spica (star) from spinning in height, and drags its tail on the Galaxy in elevation. Even if the seas were his ink, the clouds his hand, and the mountains his gold, they would fall short of what he gifts. His highness taught me the beauties of praiseworthy character, and his presence accustomed me to generosity with what is available. I do not gather the scattered money except to disperse it, nor do I go with withholding except in its path. I do not fear poverty while I am the neighbor of the sea, nor do I fear going astray while I travel in the light of the full moon. He is none other than he who, if described, is known, and if mentioned, is thanked. That is none other than the Just, Auspicious King, and the Successor of Al-Ma'mun, Abu al-Abbas Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah strengthen his victory in the protected kingdom and prolong his survival to facilitate the rugged paths and bring joy to the sad.\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Verses of Aban ibn Abd al-Hamid al-Ladhiqi to Al-Fadl ibn Yahya al-Barmaki who gave him for them what enriched him\"\nAnd they are:\n\"I am of the Prince's need and a treasure... Of the Prince's treasures possessing profits.\nA scribe, a calculator, a man of letters, intelligent... An advisor exceeding the advisors.\nAn eloquent poet, lighter than the feather... Of what is under the wing.\nI have in grammar acumen and criticism... I have in it a necklace with a sash.\nIf the Prince - may Allah reform him - shoots me... As spears, I hit the edge of spears.\nI am not huge, O my Prince, nor stupid... Nor short and round (Dahdah).\nA lank beard and a beautiful face... And burning like the flame of a lamp.\nAnd fresh talk in every art... And having insight into witty trifles.\nHow much and how much I have hidden with me a hadith... That is with kings like apples.\nThe most auspicious of people in bird omens on a day of hunting... In my morning and at the time of my evening.\nThe most sighted of people in wars and horses... And in beautiful, pretty maidens.\nAll this I have gathered, and praise be to Allah... For that I am of witty temperament.\nI am not the ascetic tucking up his clothes... Nor the ugly, impudent jester.\nIf the Prince calls me, he finds from me... A brisk one like the shouting bell.\"\nAnd it is long and current.",

    "text": "I love that people remain below me… throughout life in noble deeds. By God, I never loved wealth… for anything except generosity. I give and others benefit from me… while whatever remains will perish. Whoever competes in wealth does so to widen its sources, lengthen its streams, multiply its kinds—collecting the speaking and choking the mute within his pouches. But I compete in greatness and noble virtues, and I see that bearing burdens is among the greatest gains. I care only for aiding free-hearted people and rescuing them from the claws of treacherous fate. I love that people remain beneath me in good deeds and pleasant qualities. And by God, the highest levels of faith and its loftiest conditions: I do not love wealth except to give it, and to show generosity to its deserving people. I believe that what I give remains and endures; while what I withhold will perish and fade. And how could it be otherwise, when I serve a king who personifies glory, embodies generosity, whose ambition in giving reaches beyond the highest star and drags its hem across the Milky Way in loftiness? If the seas were his ink, the clouds his hand, and the mountains his gold, they would still fall short of what he bestows.\n\nHis lofty rank has taught me praiseworthy character, and his presence has trained me in generosity with whatever is at hand. I gather wealth only to distribute it, and I walk with restraint only along the path that leads to giving. I do not fear poverty while I am a neighbor of the sea, nor fear misguidance while traveling in the light of the full moon.

A writer, accountant, eloquent poet… clever, honest, surpassing the honest. A poet whose verse splits meaning like a blade… lighter than a feather beneath a wing.\n\nIn grammar I have insight and critique… in it I possess a necklace with a clasp. If the emir casts me, God will cast him… a spear that strikes like the edge of spears. I am not large, my lord, nor stout… nor a tumbling hulk. A soft beard, a handsome face… shining like the flame of a lamp. Novel in conversation in every art… perceptive of subtle witticisms.\n\nHow many stories I have kept hidden… stories dear to kings like apples. The luckiest of men when hunting… morning and evening alike. Most perceptive in war, horses… and beautiful maidens with charming looks. All this have I gathered, and praise be to God… for I am of refined temperament. I am neither a cloistered ascetic… nor a shameless fool. If the emir calls me, he finds in me… a warrior like a ringing bell.\n\nAnd it is long, widely circulated.",

    "text": "Were it not that describing oneself to Kings and Masters and mentioning what virtue one has when seeking a means is among the known customs and habits, Yusuf the Truthful son of Israel (Jacob) son of the Sacrificed (Isaac) son of the Friend (Abraham) - upon them be the best prayer and peace - would not have praised himself when he said to the Aziz: \"Appoint me over the storehouses of the land, indeed I am a knowing guardian.\" This is an introduction to apologize to the Prince - may Allah prolong his survival - for praising myself to his presence when presenting it for his service.\nFor I am a need among his needs, and the virtuous are the needs of the Sultan; and a treasure among his treasures, and the capable are the treasures of the time. I have gathered, praise be to Allah, the tools of royal service, and acquired the instruments of sultanic works. My hand in writing is like lightning, my pen is celestial in running, my handwriting is like a garden after rain, my eloquence brings its harvest near and its range far, and my speech in correspondence comforts its hearer and pleases its manufacturer. I have in calculation a line by which I apply the joint of correctness, and take with it the edges of literature. I solve in grammar the subtleties of problems and remove the obstruction of shapes. My genius in poetry is unlike any genius, and my nature is unlike any nature. The virgins of my thoughts are brides I clothed with rhymes and adorned with meanings, so they travel the path of proverbs and run the course of imagination.\nI have of compassion and advice what is the fruit of correct belief, and of loyalty and support what fulfills the rights of allegiance. I have a sound creation, an accepted image, honeyed traits, and light characteristics which are heavy in the balance of virtue. I am not the thin, slender, despised one, nor the huge, grand, famous one. I am not tall exceeding the tall, nor short outside the limit of moderation. I am not the cold ascetic, nor the rebellious assassin, nor the abstinent ascetic, nor the exposed licentious.\nI mix prudence with kindness, and dignity with burning (brightness). I adorn beauty with eloquence, and lightness with preponderance. I combine the seriousness of scholars and wise men with the jest of jesters and wits. I am not devoid of the etiquettes of the Diwan and the battlefield, and the beauties of scribes and knights. Opinion is not lacking with me; I see by its beginnings the ends of matters, and uncover the covers of curtains from their ambiguities.\nSo I am at times the pillar of princes and the equipment of chiefs, and at times the basil of boon companions and the melon of wits. At times the bitterness of cups is swallowed by me, and the joy of souls is derived from my company. At times I give Jihad the fullest shares of diligence, and imprint the judgment of endurance in the truth of the struggle. At times I extend the hand of jest, so I do not speak a letter in seriousness, nor hide from silliness with silliness. My insight in turning the mill of war, igniting the ember of stabbing and striking, and grinding enemies like grinding grain is not less than my insight in exiting in company from the shell, rising the stars of the drinking companion, making the tongues of lutes speak, asking rain from the clouds of intimacy, and breaking the seal of amusement. Nor is my knowledge of fine horses, sharp blades, and strong bows less than my knowledge of the branches of statures, the apples of cheeks, and the pomegranates of breasts. Nor is what I have of the news of Arabs and non-Arabs, and types of sciences and wisdoms, and etiquettes of the sword and pen, less than what I have of pleasant superstitions and humors of jokes, which are better than basil, wine, and apples. I do not resemble anything in lecturing with them and burning in good expression of them except the flame of the lamp and the shouting bell. Then I have in hunting, regarding the luck of birds, fulfilling the wish, and obtaining victory, what makes its trace good with Kings and its fruit sweet to them.\nIt is incumbent upon the Prince to accept the one who gathered the dispersed parts of these beauties with a good acceptance, and collar him with a necklace of favors, and to select him for himself, and take him for his seriousness and jest. If he wishes, he populates the gatherings of his intimacy with him. If he wishes, he mends with him the rents of his kingdom. If he wants, he specializes him for his sitting and company. If he wants, he entrusts him with a side of the sides of his kingdom. If he loves, he delegates to him the refinement of his works and the investing of his wealth. If he loves, he draws from him the sword of the tax and brings out the lion of the battalion, so he finds with him in all these states and affairs what verifies the best thoughts.\nI have introduced myself to the Prince with my effort, and described to him what I have. If his witnessed generosity, good character, and high ambitions incite him to accept me and realize my hope, I will be the protégé who keeps the trust and the servant who thanks the favors. If he folds me in the folds of negligence and wraps me in the wraps of harshness, then in the wide earth there is a place to roam for one whose shadow has narrowed, and upon Allah then upon the King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah strengthen his victory - is reliance. I will spread my hope to his presence which is the Kaaba of hopes, the place of saddle-dropping, the Qibla of virtuous men, the refuge of persecuted kings, and the escape of tested masters. I will strike with an arrow in quoting from its light and scooping from its sea, and demonstrate my good condition by what appears on the one it helped.

It would shake green until the fruit comes out.\nYou see him; 'No', 'Meet me', 'Return', 'Will', and 'Promise'... He did not say this, nor is there a need for him in it.\nBut he says 'Yes', 'Rejoice', 'Here', 'Take',... 'This'; mankind acknowledged his virtue for him.\nIf the scribes of Allah's creation, all of them... Yes, and their accountants, came to you and hastened.\nTo calculate or write a tenth of what... Your hands gifted one day of the days, they would not be able.\"\nMay Allah preserve our Master the King Khwarazm Shah for generosity and bounty. He is the one who, if he touched a dry stick, the water would return to the column, until it shakes and blossoms, and greens and fruits. He is the one on whose tongue do not run words of rejection and expressions of promising, like 'No', 'Will', 'Promise', 'Tomorrow', or 'After tomorrow'. But his saying to his asker and the seeker of his gift is: 'Yes', 'Rejoice', 'Here', 'Wealth has come to you', and 'Take this and that'. If the scribes of the earth and the accountants of creation gathered to write his gifts and calculate his presents, they would not be able to record a tenth of what his hands gift. So may his height last for him, and may whoever is hostile to him be his ransom.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Farazdaq\"\n\"Regarding Yazid ibn al-Muhallab when he was removed from Khurasan\"\n\"Abu Khalid, Khurasan was lost after you... And those with needs said: Where is Yazid?\nThe throne of the kingdom has no joy after you... Nor does a generous one have generosity after your generosity.\nSo the East was not rained upon after you with a rain... Nor did a stick turn green in the two Marws after you.\"\nI - may Allah prolong the life of the Prince - mourn for Khurasan, for events have happened in it, and confusion has covered it after him. Its affairs were disrupted, its frontiers were lost by his distance, and its landmarks became disguised since they became without his trace. Its pulpits almost wept for the loss of his name. The sons of needs and the owners of requests said: Oh my sorrow for Yazid and his granting to those coming to his door, and his good response to those intending his side. Oh my regret for that general honor, great character, noble nature, and massive gift. The throne of the kingdom has no joy with his absence, nor does generosity have a soul in Khurasan after him. Since his shading shadow departed from it and his abundant favor left it, neither a rain nor a drop rained on it, nor did a stick turn green in the two Marws, nor did a festival return to them. Even if the calamity was great by his removal, he was not removed from the authority of his virtue. And even if he was dismissed from Khurasan, he was not dismissed from doing good. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Ishaq al-Sabi regarding Al-Muhallabi the Vizier\"\n\"He has a hand that excelled in generosity with its gift... And logic whose pearls scatter on the paper.\nSo a seal is hidden in the belly of its palm... And in its fingertips Sahban is concealed.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"He has clouds of generosity in his fingertips... Their rains are white silver and gold.\"\nAnd the saying of Ali ibn Jabala regarding Abu Dulaf:\n\"Abu Dulaf, indeed tolerance did not cease... Shackled, complaining to Allah of its shackles.\nSo my Lord gave it glad tidings of the birth of Qasim... And sent Gabriel to it, so he untied it.\"\nMay Allah preserve our Master the King Khwarazm Shah. Allah's eye is on his high hand when it writes, and may a lasting protection never cease to be upon it when it gifts. It is the one from whose fingertips flow seas that eject pearls and coral, and from its palm arise clouds that rain silver and gold nuggets. It is as if Sahban is in it dragging the tail of his eloquence, and Hatim establishing the trace of his tolerance. No wonder that generosity is his ally, his friend, and his intimate. He did not cease to be a prisoner of a jail whose gate was locked, and a companion of shackles whose remedy was weak. So Allah gave him glad tidings of the birth of the Auspicious King, Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun. And He sent Gabriel, so he untied his shackles, cured his burning thirst, removed his illness, and made his tongue speak with praise to Him who broke a captivity and made ease after hardship, and with thanks to Him who brought him out by the blessing of his birth and the happiness of his resource from the humiliation of slavery to the glory of freedom, and from the burning of Hell to the Paradise of Bliss. May the world not lack beauty by him for whom Generosity is among his freedmen, thankful ones, and saints. May Allah perpetuate his days for him for noble deeds and literatures, as long as the coolness of youth is deemed good and the coldness of drink is found pleasant.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"Whenever askers come to him, lamps of... Cheerfulness and joy light up on him.\nHe has favors for those of kindness as if they are... The locations of rain water in the desolate land.\"\nAnd the saying of Marwan ibn Abi Hafsa:\n\"O you for whom Allah fashioned his palm from generosity...

So the dew of your palms lasted and the downpour stopped.\"\nWe have, praise be to Allah, a King who, when askers come to him and hopers intend him, the water of good news flows in his moon-like human face, and he gives them glad tidings of safety from time. His favors fall upon them like the locations of rain in the desolate land. How could he not be so when Allah created him from the clay of generosity, and made his palm the palm of the aided? He prefers nothing but generosity with what is available. It is as if he and generosity are from one wood. If what he gives were the sand of 'Alij, the sand would run out. If he vied with the downpour, the downpour would cease. May Allah water his morals with their likes from the flood of the rain clouds, and may they never cease to ease roughness and remove sadness.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Tammam\"\n\"He is the sea from whichever sides you come to him...

Except in the Tashahhud, but his saying is 'Yes'.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"I asked Dew and Generosity: Are you free?... They both said: We belong to Ubayd.\nI said: And who is your master? So they towered... Over me and said: Khalid ibn Yazid.\"\nOur Master the King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah perpetuate his kingdom and strengthen his victory - is a sea whose deep is kindness and whose coast is known generosity. His favors have accustomed him to spreading the palm, so if he wanted to clench it, his fingertips would not answer him. Whenever he is asked, his chest expands, his side shakes, his ease translates for him, the page of cheerfulness is read in his face, the crescent of joy shines from him, and the lightning of happiness flashes in him, until it is as if he is given what he gives. His sayings are 'Yes', and his actions are 'Yes'. People are the slaves of his bounty and benevolence. Were it not for the Tashahhud, he would not run 'No' on his tongue. I asked Dew and Generosity, I said to them: Tell me about yourselves, are you free? They said: We are nothing but slaves truly, and owned by bondage. I said: And who is your master? Pride took them with arrogance, and they dragged the tails of height and boasting, and said: He whose mention mouths find pleasant, and for whom no likes are seen, Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun Khwarazm Shah. When the mention of the High Name knocked on my hearing, I turned my face towards the presence of high ranks, and spread the earth with my hand a spreading, and engraved the dust with my mouth an engraving. I said: Many a slavery is better than freedom, and many a bondage is better than emancipation. May you never cease to be of the possessions of that King as long as the stars of the sky rotate in the orbit.\n\nChapter\nKindness of Asking\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"O you whose right hand never ceased since it was created... To be the second drink and the first drink for the seeker of gift.\nIf you are doing a favor to a man... For the virtue of affection, then I am that man.\nSo bestow upon me a favor from you that revives me... For I am thankful for the kindness, bearing (it).\"\nYou, O Prince - may Allah prolong your survival - are a sea that is generous to those who hope for it without excuses, and waters those who come to it second drinks after first drinks. If you are doing a favor to a distressed man, who has dedicated the parts of his soul to your affection, and spread the sides of his chest for your love, then I am that man described by loyalty to you, known for supporting you. You are higher of eye (more discerning) regarding what you see of bestowing a fruit from the fruits of your virtue that revives me from the speed of poverty, and saves me from the fangs of time. Knowing that I am thankful for the favor, keeping the trust, God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Bedouin to Ma'n ibn Zaida\"\n\"May Allah reform you; what my hand shows is little... And the dependents have destroyed my money as they increased.\nChicks of a nest in a cast-away desert... Were in goodness as long as harm did not visit them.\nTime leaned upon them with its chest...

    "text": "I complain to the Prince - may Allah reform him - of the bad state, the lack of money, and the abundance of dependents. Among them are downy chicks, old while they are young. They were in the shade of grace and under the wing of wealth, but days attacked them by reclaiming what they lent and robbing what they benefited. They threw their weight upon them and brought down their calamities upon them. When their nest rejected them and their living narrowed upon them, and they endured horrors that cause greyness and calamities that leave parents white-haired, they guided me to the Prince - may Allah support him with wide hopes - and sent me to him from distant lands, and waited for my return to them with leafy wood, abundant luck from fortunes, laden mounts, and heavy bags. If he sees - may Allah elevate his opinion - to realize their thoughts and delight their eyes, and bring them out from tightness to ease and from disturbance to tranquility, he will do so, God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"O Mighty One (Aziz), harm has touched us... All, and our family are scattered.\nWe have among men a very old man... And we have goods of little value.\nTheir seekers became few so they became stagnant... And our trade with them is trifles.\nSo count our reward and give us full measure... And be charitable, for we are dead.\"\nO Mighty One - may Allah strengthen your victory and elevate your command - harm has touched us and our family, and bitter time has bent over us. Imbalance and dispersion have encompassed us, and sons and daughters have separated from us. We have a very old man from whose body and strength time has taken as it took from his state and grace. Allah afflicted him with non-existence upon old age. So we became of those with lowered degrees and owners of goods of little value. The matter is in stagnation, which is the brother of corruption, and its bad effect on a small trade of ours and a meager sustenance. We suffer from it mote in the eyes, choking in the throats, and lumps in the chests. So count the abundant reward and the beautiful thanks by a noble look from you that revives us while we are dead, and resurrects us while we are dust. And be charitable to us, indeed Allah is with the doers of good. And His prayers be upon the Chosen Prophet Muhammad and all his family.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Abdullah al-Khali' to Ibn Tulun\"\n\"I am praising, I am thanking, I am publishing... I am hungry, I am on foot, I am naked.\nThey are six and I am the guarantor for half of them... So be the guarantor for half of them with a standard.\nFeed and mount and clothe, then you have loyalty... Upon choosing the beauties of the good ones.\nAnd shame is in praising other than you, so suffice me... By generosity from you, my exposure to shame.\nAnd Fire to me is like begging, so do you see... Not to task me with entering the Fire?\"\nI - may Allah prolong the survival of our Master - am praising him, thanking him, publishing his virtue. But I am hungry, and hunger is a great affliction and painful punishment. And on foot, and being on foot is mutilation. And naked, and nakedness is humiliation. These are six qualities; I have guaranteed half of them, and guaranteed our Master's generosity the other half, to run according to his manner in bestowing favor by feeding, and kindness by leading mounts, and magnifying the patch with the robe of honor. And he has from me loyalty with praise whose description is good and whose scent is pleasant, and thanks like the thanks of the garden for the rain and the night-traveler for the moon, and spreading like the spreading of reddish musk and grey ambergris. Let him know that I see my praising other than him and my exposure to his gift as a shame that no apology washes away, nor night and day efface. Just as I protect myself from Fire in asking and spilling the water of the face before men. If he sees - may Allah elevate his opinion - to protect me from shame and not expose me to entering the Fire, he will do so running on his habit in enslaving the free. God willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet to Ali ibn Isa\"\n\"O you whom the causes of Wilayah adorned... And who singled out noble deeds with care.\nMy clothes are silk-cotton (Mulham) on a day of snow... And suffice me, I do not prolong in complaint.\"\nThe one whom Wilayah adorned - may Allah prolong our Master's survival - indeed he has adorned it with his good traits, and cared for noble deeds until I returned from his servants. May Allah prolong his survival to invest thanks from the planting of his blessings. Our Master - may Allah perpetuate his support - sees me in summer clothes with which the hands of wear have played what they played, and upon which the changes of time have eaten and drunk. Winter has extended its canopy, and cold has untied its belt, and the heads of mountains have returned white, and dressed from snow a new sheet. I do not add to this amount of complaint, even if I endured from winter the most severe injury. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"I came to you, O Aqil, without brotherhood... Nor a cause being other than hope.\nIf you bestow favor, it is not strange from you...

    "text": "Whoever seeks a means to our Master - may Allah prolong his survival - by a sanctity and a covenant, and a precedence of service, I seek a means to him by hope, spacious of sides. It suffices as a means with the virtuous generous ones, of whom he is famous for their sovereignty and the central jewel of their necklace. Then I mention to him my need for a haste of his aid, and a vanguard of his provision. If he bestows it upon me, it is not strange, and he obliges praise and thanks. If it be the other, I attribute it to the rule of Destinies running contrary to estimation, and I do not bind him with the sin of unjust Time and stumbling Luck.

In lineage, and the most giving of them of inherited wealth.\nFrom you is the giving, so give me... And upon me is your praise in the scenes.\"\nOur Master - may Allah prolong his survival - is the most generous of people in lineage, and the most noble of them in ancestry, and the most eager of them to enslave the free with favors, and the most generous of them in spending inherited and newly acquired money. Until he is, in confirming thoughts, dispersing the stored, and spending the preserved, Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun. So from him is the giving and from me the praise. To him belong the gifts, and to me the praise. Upon him is the righteousness, and upon me the thanks. I will convey of that in the crowded scenes and special gatherings what noble deeds will rejoice at and seasons will shake for. God willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Ahmad ibn Abi Bakr al-Katib to Abu al-Fadl Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Bal'ami\"\n\"O Abu al-Fadl, you have the clear Fadl (virtue)... And with what you are nicknamed, you are worthy.\nNo blessing is devoid of Zakat... That necessitated the thanks of the Lord of the Worlds.\nSo the Zakat of money is from its types... And the Zakat of Jah (status) is aiding the seeker of help.\"\nNo wonder our Master - may Allah prolong his survival - was nicknamed Al-Fadl, for he is its father, its son, and its brother. The nickname agreed with the one nicknamed, and its word matched its meaning. Allah looks after Al-Fadl and Isfadal (bestowing favor) by prolonging his period, perpetuating his joy, and guarding his soul. Our Master - may Allah perpetuate his support - has known that blessings which necessitate thanking Allah for them are hardly devoid of Zakats by which gifts are preserved and increases are milked. So the Zakat of money from its types is known, and to its deserving ones in the rule of Sharia is directed. And the Zakat of Jah is spending aid to its seeker, and fulfilling the need for its owner. Here I am asking rain from the clouds of his Jah, and seeking victory over Time by his good opinion. I ask him to occupy an hour of his days with me, to return to me what has dried up of the water of my face, which is above my blood, and renew for me what has worn out of my Jah, which is above my money. He - may Allah perpetuate his empowerment - does good beautifully, and collars his allies with favors. God Almighty willing.\n\nChapter\nDemanding and Seeking Increase\n\n\"A Note on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"Suffice as a reminder of my affair my face... And suffice you that I see you and you see me.\nAnd indeed, if I draw near, I observe my right... And if I am far, do not forget my place.\"\nThe reminder benefits the believers, and is tolerated from the sincere. I limit myself from reminding him of my affair to what my face confronts him with, and suffice myself from demanding my need by what he sees of my person and imagines of my condition. I know that if I attend him, he obliges (gives) to me, and if I am absent from him, he does not forget me. If I write to him, he answers me about my letter and to my request. Allah keeps him and protects him, and protects me from seeing evil and hearing it regarding him.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"I go for a greeting and come for its like... And suffice you with the greeting from me as a demand.\"\nI - may Allah prolong the Sheikh's survival - go to his presence for greeting and come. I do not reveal what is in my chest of need as long as the spirit accompanies me. Rather, I leave that to his piercing acumen and his constant care. I trust his answering the caller of generosity in my affair. There is no doubt in his eagerness for what leads to attracting my thanks. Suffice with the greeting as a demand, and with the visit as an exaction. Many a signal is more eloquent than an expression, and an allusion more effective than a declaration, and a tongue of condition more articulate than a tongue of speech. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"I remind, not that I knew you forgetting... My affair, nor that I think you heedless.\nBut I saw the sword, after its drawing... Needing shaking, even if it is sharp.\"\nI do not remind the Sheikh - may Allah prolong his survival - as one forgetting my interests, nor heedless of my successes. He is more remembering of the needs of his allies than to be alerted to them, and more intensely embracing of them than to be called to them. A sword may be shaken while it is sharp, and a horse urged while it is swift. I am, regarding the Sheikh - may Allah support him - on an appointment, and his fulfillment for me is in wait. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Speaker\"\n\"And I smelled the breeze of success for my need...

May the springs of tolerance never cease to explode from his fingertips, and the spring of virtue laugh about his favors. I ask him by the right of Muhammad the Messenger of Allah, his elect, his choice from his creation, and his family, who are the clan of Faith and the tree of Good Pleasure, to lighten the burden of need from me, mend what Time has whittled of me, fix what poverty broke of my wing, and combine my lamp and my success. For the like of him is above negligence, and the like of me is too small for demanding. I ask Allah to prolong his survival for a kindness that ends at its farthest, and a favor that leads by its forelock.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet, written to Al-Ma'mun\"\n\"My need to you has become distant, so order for me... O my Prince, hastily a dye.\"\nThe period - may Allah prolong the Prince's survival - has become long regarding my need with him, until the crow of its youth flew, and the day rose beside its night, and the morning of its greyness whitened, and whiteness covered the blackness of its hair. It became of those of high ages and companionship to the past days. If the Prince - may Allah elevate his command - orders for it a dye that returns the hue of its youth and delights the eyes of its loved ones with it, he would have sold stagnant goods and repaired a corrupt state. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Untying the Answer of Al-Ma'mun about it\"\n\"We have ordered for it a dangerous dye... That leaves the head like the blackness of the crow.\"\nWe have ordered for it - may Allah support you - a dye, black of skin, coal-black of jilbab, intense of robe, crow-like in color. As if it is from the darkness of horses, or from the dress of the Abbasids, or from the clothing of bereaved mothers, or from the braids of virgins, or from the pupils of houris, or from the saliva of darkness. So let it use the dye even if it is from false witnesses, and let it return youth even if it is from the goods of deception.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"If the gift is after procrastination... Then may it not be, even if it is abundant.\nSo may rain be for the gift, then rain... If it is easy, even if it is little.\nAnd poets have sharp tongues... Over defects, fulfilling, indicative.\nIt is of the intelligence of the noble if they fear them... And treat them with beautiful treatment.\nIf they place their brandings upon them... Even if they strive, they have no trick.\"\nYou have known - may Allah support you - that procrastination muddies the favor even if it is high, and makes the gift hateful even if it is splendid. Just as hastening makes it big even if it is small, and makes it much even if it is little. Poets resent those who drag them on the thorns of procrastination and deprive them of the fruit of the promise. They have tongues that drain seas, split rocks, make the absent hear, tear the veil, indicate defects, and uncover hidden things. If they brand with them, they make an outcry as they wish. If they satirize, they excel and have done evil. If their speech becomes denounced and their arrows penetrate, there is no trick to repel them unless the fruit returns to the calyxes and the children to the wombs. The prudent is he who treats them with the best treatment, does not take the path of disputation with them, looks after his honor by bestowing upon them, and protects against evil by presenting good to them. You - may Allah support you - take heed from what you hear and understand, and act by what you know.

So either you preserve the past covenant and fulfill the previous promise, and be of those who are fair and fulfill. Or else you will be rubbed and inserted into 'Fi'. And what is after it is known, and the meaning is understood. It is not hidden from people what I alluded to, and your way is to cover it. God Almighty willing.",

Either the gift or the comfort of despair.\"\nIt is incumbent upon me - may Allah support the Prince - not to say other than the truth, and my fingertips run not with other than honesty. Regarding either matter, its consequence is sweet, and the weight of its fruit is light. I have a subtle point of its width and a short one of its length, which is that striking fives for sixes is not of the action of noble people. So either the fruit of success or the spirit of despair. I say what Allah the Manan said: 'So retention with honor or release with kindness.'\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet regarding Yahya ibn Khalid al-Barmaki\"\n\"I saw Yahya - may Allah perpetuate his state - ... Doing of kindness what no one has done.\nHe forgets what was of his favor always... To the seekers, and does not forget what is promised.\"\nOur Master - may Allah prolong his survival - is the unique of mankind and the single of the noble. His days are a fertile spring, and his generosity is strange and wondrous. He folds what preceded of benevolence in the folds of negligence and forgetfulness, and remembers what precedes of his promise until he engraves it in the gem of his chest, and directs all his thought to fulfilling it. As if he has looked into the biographies of our Master the King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah perpetuate his kingdom - and encompassed the greatness of his blessings and the subtleties of his generosity, so he adopted his character and ran in his paths. By my life, whoever contemplated his news and observed his traces knew that Generosity is Ma'muni not Barmaki, and Bounty is Khwarazm Shahi not Hatimi. He knew that were it not for the wonders of Allah's creation and the marvels of Allah's kindness, those noble deeds would not have grown in flesh, nor those virtues mixed with blood, nor those beauties gathered in a person, nor those prides organized in a soul. So Glory be to Allah when you enter the evening and when you enter the morning, and Glory be to the Creator of Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"Necessities in matters call... To using what is not befitting of etiquette.\nAnd the confusion of a man in his fluctuation... Calls to his persistence in the request.\"\nOur Master - may Allah prolong his survival - knows that necessity permits the prohibited, breaks chivalry, rejects youthfulness, and calls a man to what is not good for him nor befitting his lineage and etiquette. Just as he knows that excessive confusion prevents the obligatory choice, and carries the shy to impudence until he does not care about ugliness. May Allah protect our Master from all that runs contrary to his preference and comes between him and his choice. Violent necessity and severe confusion have combined upon me - may Allah perpetuate our Master's support - which licensed for me the persistence which is not of my characteristics, and incited me to urgency which was not of my ways. Our Master - may Allah perpetuate his days - is higher of eye in what he sees of treating my condition with the medicine of his generosity, and holding my last breath with a drop of his rain.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"May Allah prolong safety and survival for you... And increase you in the world in height and ascent.\nI sent my messenger and he is the bearer of my note... So your opinion regarding what I said yesterday is successful.\"\nThe Sheikh - may Allah prolong his survival and perpetuate his ascent in high ranks - meets with my note the one who is my messenger in obtaining my request. So his opinion in returning my thought confirmed, and dismissing it with success granted, God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on the Saying of the Poet to Abdullah ibn Tahir\"\n\"What shall I say if I am asked and it is said to me... What did you obtain from the Generous, the Preferring?\nIf I said he gave me, I lied, and if I say... The Prince was stingy with his money, it would not be beautiful.\nSo choose for yourself what I say, for I... Must inform them even if I am not asked.\"\nI - may Allah prolong the Prince - am of rising intention, departing resolve, traveling concern and belief. Nothing remains but the march, and from Allah is facilitation. I do not know what to say when I return to my homelands and authority, and witness my friends and brothers, and they ask me about my condition in his presence and my share of the fruits of his service. If I said I obtained the fertile gardens of his blessing, and the cloud of his connection rained on me, the tongue of my condition would belie the tongue of my speech, and my bags and loads would not praise him. And if I said that the Prince - may Allah perpetuate his support - was stingy and did not verify the thought, I would be describing the full moon as not shining, the musk as not diffusing scent, and the sea as sinking and not overflowing. So I stand where his choice stops me, of thanks or complaint, and his preference approves for me, of praise or seeking increase. If he sees - may Allah elevate his opinion - to unleash my tongue with the more beautiful of the two sayings regarding him, and entrust me only to the better of the two thoughts of him, he will do so, God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Untying the Answer to it by Abdullah ibn Tahir\"\n\"You hastened us, so the hastiness of our kindness came to you... Little; had you given us respite, it would not have been little.\nSo take the little and be as if you did not say... And we will be as if we did not do.\"",

    "text": "You addressed us - may Allah support you - with the address of one who equipped, loaded, and emerged, marching without slackening and heading without turning back. We preferred that you stay and not depart, so that we reach of fulfilling your right what comes with leisure, not with speed and haste. Since you have renewed your resolve for travel, and stripped your concern for the homeland, may Allah make the best accompanying you in your stay and departure, your travel and presence, and all your actions and directions. We have ordered for you a little haste of kindness; what makes it much is the excuse in the shortcoming with the hastiness. So take it and suppose that you did not ask, so we know that we did not give. The matter is sufficient with us, neither for us nor against us. And (?) between us is standing, no blame binds either of us. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Mansur al-Faqih\"\n\"Indeed, the Imam of Hijaz judges... Upon you in the promise with guarantee.\nAnd I have promises with you following in succession... Known of time and place.\nSo fulfill the promise or declare... The breach, and be safe from time.\nAnd do not torture with 'will' (saufa) a heart... Ulcerated by procrastination and delay.\"\nThe Sheikh - may Allah prolong his survival - is Hijazi in Fiqh, Shafi'i in religion. Among his doctrine is that whoever promised a promise has guaranteed a guarantee and covenanted a covenant. And in the religion of chivalry and rights of youthfulness is that whoever gave the document from his tongue, its conditions are binding on him in reality. I have in the custody of his generosity promises known of times and eras, known of locations and places. If he fulfills the covenant and completes the contract, he has mended my fracture, untied my captivity, and engrossed my thanks. If he sees otherwise, then declaration is comforting, and there is no harm in the cold of despair. How worthy he is not to increase the torture of a heart exhausted by the promise, stripped on the thorns of procrastination, wounded by the fangs of time. Allah aids him in good deeds, grants him success for benevolences, and provides him abundant share of the enduring righteous deeds.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Rumi\"\n\"May I be your ransom; I did not ask... You for that robe for a shroud.\nI asked you for it to wear it... While my soul is still in my body.\nProcrastination has become long with it... And I feared the accidents of time.\nSo do not make it a yarn... Its weaver rejoiced to Aden.\nLo, bestow it, for indeed... Mastery is the hastening of favors.\nLo, and make it complying with... The beauties of your handsome face.\nPure like your honor, indeed it... Was not mixed with filth.\nThick like your opinion... Indeed it and firmness are in a horn (coupled).\nThin like your acumen which... became finer than intellects.\nAnd let not its value impress you... Suffice with praise as a price.\nAnd suffice you, if you were stingy with it... With the loss of praise as a loss.\"\nMay Allah make me your ransom, O my master, and prolong your survival. Until when is this severe procrastination with the new robe? Why did the promise in it become like threats? Did you not know that I asked you for it to wear in my life, not to be shrouded in it at my death? Deferment has become long with it, violent, until I feared the hindrances of accidents, and was not safe from the calamities of time. It should not be that its weaver rejoiced to Yemen and threw his staff in Sana'a or Aden. The guarantor is only your virtue in sufficing the trouble of requesting it, and running on the rule of your sovereignty in bestowing it upon me, and answering my prayer by your generosity to execute it complying with your beauties, imitating your characteristics. And make it pure like your honor which was not mixed with what stains it, nor marred by what dirties it. Choose it thick like your opinion which no defect permeates, thin like your acumen which no slip encounters. Let not its value seem great to you, for praise is higher and more expensive to Allah, and more worthy of extraction. If you were stingy with it - and far be it from you - suffice you the missing of thanks as a defect, and enough.\n\nChapter\nProcrastination and Breaking the Promise\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Rumi\"\n\"If your procrastination had a spirit and a body... In its length, we would not doubt that it is Awj (bin Unuq).\nJust as your gift, with what is in it of shortness... If it passed by people, they would say: Ya'juj (Gog) passed.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"We tested you, praise be to Allah... Indeed testing avails.\nAnd behold, all your promises... And the wind are equal.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"You prolonged waiting for tomorrow after tomorrow... And I did not see from you a hand over a hand.\nSo name a tomorrow whose time I wait for... For every tomorrow has after it a thousand tomorrows.\"",

    "text": "Procrastination has become long - may Allah prolong your survival, my master - as if I bend from it upon Awj, or see by it the shadow of the spear, and witness the life of the vulture, or suffer the night of abandonment, or witness the Day of Resurrection. I do not compare your gift to Ya'juj in its shortness, littleness, and smallness. It is shorter than the fingertip of an ant, less than a single atom, and smaller than a tuft of hair under the lower lip. I have tested you - if tests were useful, and revealed to me the consequences from you - regarding promises that have resemblance to the wind, and they are a cause of the deceiving lightning, and between them and the waterless cloud is a relation. Until when - may Allah reform you - do you drag me on the thorns of procrastination, deprive me of the fruit of the promise, and distract me with tomorrow and after tomorrow, while I do not see a hand for you over a hand? Has the time not come for you to specify the relied-upon day, and leave me from the frequent mention of tomorrow, for it is far of term, connected to eternity?\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"I asked you for a need, so you answered regarding it... With the best that can be of an answer.\nWhen I aimed for it, it aimed for the Pleiades... So my need became above the clouds.\"\nAnd the saying of Abu Nuwas:\n\"You promised me your promise until when... You made me covet the treasure of Qarun.\nYou came at night with washing water... Washing what you said with soap.\"\nAnd the saying of Abu al-Ayna':\n\"I do not wonder, nay your deeds are more wondrous... At the length of my frequenting you while you lie.\nAnd you say to me a saying I think you are truthful... So I come out of greed to you and go.\nIf I and you gathered in a session... They would say: Musaylimah and this is Ash'ab.\"\nI asked you - may Allah reform you - for a need, light in burden upon you, heavy in favor for you. You combined for me in it the best answer and the most complete acceptance. When I aimed for it, it was with the Pleiades in height, and with Capella in direction. I began imagining it once at the end of the earth, and at times above the clouds. Long have you made me covet the treasures of Qarun with your honeyed promises, then followed them with your washed excuses. I do not know which of our two states is more wondrous, just as I do not know which is more lying: My greed for you which renews my reliance on you and repeats my frequenting you, or your tongue which professes lying as a doctrine and finds breach soft as a mount. If a crowded forum gathered me and you, or a private gathering joined us, some of their people would turn to others criticizing you and cursing you, saying: This is Musaylimah, meaning you, and this is Ash'ab, meaning me, and attributing me to false greed. Musaylimah was the biggest liar the green (sky) shaded, and Ash'ab the greediest the dusty (earth) carried. News of that in lying has traveled in the lands and arrived at the waters, and news of this in greed has flown in the horizons and ridden the mouths. May Allah accept our repentance from lying and calumny, and from pure breach, and from greed that leads to stain (nature), by His grace and kindness and vast mercy.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Tammam\"\n\"And a veiled one I sought, so I found him... A star distant from the riders of seekers.\nWhen I lacked his gift, I deprived him... Of my thanks, so we went away deprived together.\"\nIf your veiling - may Allah support you - has become long, your seclusion intense, and your doorman grim. How many a veiled one whose side I sought and whose door I intended, I found him a star distant from the seekers, and a snake that does not listen to charmers. When he deprived me of wealth, I deprived him of praise. When he prevented me the gift, I prevented him the praise. So we ended up together in deprivation; as for him, of generosity, and as for me, of blessing. He of thanks, and I of abundance. He has done good to me as he wished, since he did evil. Did he not free my shoulder from the slavery of the favor, and not oblige me to keep the trust? Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Di'bil\"\n\"You promised the sandal then turned away from it... As if you desire insult and slander.\nIf you do not gift me a sandal, then be it... If you dotted a letter after the Nun.\"\nYou promised me - may Allah support you - the sandal and did not help, but turned away from mentioning it and shunned. So you became a target for the arrows of blame and became slandered. If you gift it now, otherwise you will wear the robe of the cheated, and be it if you dotted the letter after the Nun (Na'l -> Baghl/Mule?). The prudent is he who protects honor with the lowest offer, and does not expose it to tribulation. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"I accompanied you for two years in the state of my estrangement... Hoping for your dew, and madness has arts.\nSo I did not obtain from you a gift other than that I... Learned how the humiliation of poverty is.\"",

    "text": "Oh my sorrow, if sorrow avails. Oh my grief, if grief is useful: For two years I exhausted in your company and spent in your service. I had from the distress of estrangement a companion and intimate, and from hope, wide of regions, a motive and ally. Deception is hidden, and madness has arts... So I did not enjoy a gift from you nor settle with a benefit, nor attain what enriches me like the feather of a bird. Rather, I learned how the humiliation of poverty is, and how the injustice of Time assaults. Complaint is to Allah not of Him. In Him, Exalted, is compensation for every goer and replacement for every missed thing. So praise be to Him for His favors, and His prayers be upon the Prophet Muhammad and his family.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Professor Abu Bakr al-Khawarizmi\"\n\"Lo, who will convey to the Professor that I... Am the sharp sword, shyness sheathed it.\nI helped, and the salt lands with you are a pasture... And we thirst, and the mirage with you is water.\nTime knocks on us, and every day... We have a calamity whose margins are weeping.\nYou had promised us a look, but it was slow... And slow horses may reach (eventually).\nIf fulfillment is difficult with you one day... Then demanding is present with us.\nAnd a people other than me are satisfied with hope... And I have no satisfaction with their judgment.\nFor the brother of hope is on certainty... Of tribulation, and in the suggestion is doubt.\nThe worst of hopers is a brother of procrastination... Hope populates his sides.\nIf it is morning, his appointment is evening... And if it is evening, his appointment is forenoon.\nThis admonition is a mediator, but... It has two collars: praise or satire.\nBetween success and hindrance is a border... And a bridge called generosity.\nSo do not complain of destiny, for one who abuses... Himself does not complain; you are destiny.\nBe gentle with the Prince, for everything... By which benefits are attained is alchemy.\nMay Allah prolong the ages of high ranks... And that is that survival prolongs for you.\nAnd may a palm not cease to extend to you... Its merchandise is praise or supplication.\nIf Time is pleased with the like of my soul... As a ransom for you, then it is the ransom for you.\"\nMy heart - may Allah prolong the survival of our Master the Professor - is full of blame for him; blame abounds for it and the book narrows from it. But my tongue, even if it is a massive sword and a sharp blade, shyness has sheathed it due to the majesty of our Master and his nobility, and the reverence of what I imagine of the elevation of his rank and place. Oh my wonder, all wonder, at our drought in his neighborhood, and our thirst near his house! Salt lands with him are a fresh pasture, and drink with him is fresh water. Time attacks us with the sharpness of its nail and the meanness of its nail, raids us with its accidents and changes, and exposes us to misfortunes followed by misfortunes, and calamities in which we have speeches, whose margins are weeping that breaks the necklaces of tears, and complaining that speaks of the fire between the ribs. He - may Allah support him - had promised us of his good look at us what the thought of it was beautiful, and we waited for it long. It was slow, and horses may reach despite their slowness, and fold the stages with the shortness of their step. If fulfillment is difficult with him, demanding is present with us. If negligence lasts from him, demanding lasts from us. Other than me is he who is satisfied with hope and inclines in it to satisfaction, because the brother of hope is on certainty of tribulation and in doubt of relief and gift. The worst of the hoped-for is he whose procrastination increases and intensifies, and the life of hope in his presence lengthens and extends. If he enters morning, he makes the appointment evening, and if he goes in the evening, he makes it morning. It is known that admonition is a mediator having two ends: praise or satire that travel in the lands and reveal offense and benevolence. Between success and release, and suspension and hindrance, is a bridge whose water is medicine and whose wind is breeze, and its name is generosity. So let not our Master - may Allah perpetuate his support - complain of destiny, thus complaining of himself and deceiving his sense, because he is the Sultan, and he is destiny and time. What I ask is that he be gentle like the Prince - may Allah prolong his survival - so he shakes the side of his generosity and asks rain for me from the cloud of his blessings. For every water that calmed thirst is water, and everything by which benefits are attained is alchemy. I ask Allah to prolong the ages of high ranks by the length of his life and the height of his destiny and command. May his conditions not cease to be happy and envied, hopes attached to him, and palms spread with praise for him and prayer for him. And may his survival and meeting not cease to be a beauty for this world. If Time is pleased with my soul as a ransom for him, it is his ransom and loyalty.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet to Abu Dulaf al-Qasim ibn Isa\"\n\"Abu Dulaf, no seeker of need remained... Among people other than me, and the place is barren.\nDoes it please you that I returned from you disappointed... While no creature is seen disappointed from your dew?\nAnd that I turned praise into blame... And a speaker stood with it among the worlds?\nHow, while you are the favoring benefactor who... For every stranger is a share of his dew?\nIf I attain what I hoped from you, then I... Am worthy, otherwise departure is near.\"\nThe good look of the Prince - may Allah prolong his survival - has encompassed all his petitioners, hopers, and visitors. I do not know anyone but that he reached a share of his gifts and struck with an arrow in his bounty, except me. For I see myself outside this general (inclusion), despite what I have of loyalty to him and service to him of the specific. I wish I knew, does it please the Prince - may Allah support him - that I prolong the rein of absence, then leave his presence with disappointment, while no one has been seen disappointed in his days or failed from his favors? Does he accept that my praise turns into disparagement, my eulogy into slander, and my thanks into complaint, undertaken by speakers extending the reins of address and prolonging the span of verbosity? No, by Allah! How, when he is the favoring benefactor, saddled in benevolence and bridled, who has for every one of his hopers the fullest share of his spacious protection and fertile place? If he observes my condition with the eye of care, and remedies the illness of my hopes with the medicine of favor, then I am worthy from him of a favor that weights my back and engrosses my thanks. Otherwise, I am of those who travel and do not rest, nor give rest, nor does the wind attach to them. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Suffice me and suffice you of procrastination and repetition... I wasted my life on promised delay.\nA distant procrastination and an attainment I do not reach... And a contract of promise with an action not knotted.\nSo execute your resolve regarding us if you want for us... Good, for my resolve is executing, not returned.\nToday is the last day of my returning... And today I cut my hopes with my emphasis.\nDo not think me like one whose ways narrowed... My Lord is Kind and my provision is not blocked.\"\nBy Allah, I have become weary of delay and repetition, and did not obtain from the abundance of appointments except the near procrastination and the distant attainment. So if you execute your resolve in giving, otherwise I executed my resolve on departure. This, my master, is the first day of viewing and the last day of returning. Do not think me of those upon whom the ways narrowed and mounts lacked. Allah Almighty is Kind, His making with me is encompassing, His provision for me is returned (to me), and His door before me is not blocked. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"A people whose promises are embellished... Embellished by speech and lies.\nThe hoper of their gift always needs... Three things without testing:\nTreasures of Qarun to be his... And the life of Noah and the patience of Job.\"\nI complain to Allah then to you, O my master - may Allah perpetuate your glory - of a people whose promises are embellished with sayings of lies, decorated with ornaments of falsehoods. If the hoper seeks them to seek aid, he does not do without three things in waiting for their bounty: The treasures of Qarun, the like of whom was not created in wealth. And the life of Noah, than whom there is none longer in ages. And the patience of Job, who is cited as a proverb in endurance. Allah is the Helper against the burning of waiting and the hardships of compulsion.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"I will claim that I was pleased while I was not pleased... And claim that I was treated kindly while I was shunned.\nAnd claim that I returned in the best state... And I am not seeking a home out of necessity.\nBecause you have ability, so you do not care... Whether I was angry at your deeds or pleased.\nI will go from you holding fast to despair... And be content with what provides me sustenance.\nEither the turn of days until... They bring what I hope for, or I die.\nThus is Time, its state is buckets (turns)... It benefits riches and sometimes causes loss.\nHow many a rich man after poverty... And a winner returned having no place to spend the night.\nIf hope dies due to bad condition... Then indeed Allah is Living, does not die.\"",

If I attain what I hope from you, I am deserving; otherwise, departure is near. The noble attention of the emir—may God prolong his life—has encompassed all of his petitioners, those who hope in him, and his visitors. I know of none who has not received a portion of his gifts and drawn a share from his bounty—except me. I see myself excluded from this general generosity, despite my special loyalty and service. Oh, if only I knew—does the emir, may God strengthen him, find it easy to prolong the reign of absence, then send me away from his presence in disappointment? No one has ever been disappointed in his days, nor failed in receiving his kindness.\n\nWould he be pleased if my praise became blame, my admiration turned reproach, and my gratitude a complaint recited by speakers who extend their sermons and lengthen their phrases? By God, no. He is the generous benefactor, blazing in kindness, bridled in grace. Every one of his hopeful petitioners receives a great share from his wide protection and fertile station. If he looks upon my condition with care and remedies the illness of my hopes with his favor, then I am worthy of a gift that bends my back and consumes my thanks. Otherwise, I am among those who journey without rest, who neither find comfort nor give it, and whom the wind does not cling to—God willing.\n\n\"Another Letter Explaining the Saying of Another\":\n\n\"Enough for you and me of delay and repetition… I have wasted my life on postponed promises. A distant delay and a gift I cannot reach… a knot of pledges tied to deeds unfulfilled. So carry out your resolve for us, if you wish us well… for my resolve is firm, unresisted. Today is the last day of my petitions… and today I cut off my hopes with certainty. Do not think me one whose paths have tightened… my Lord is gentle, and my provision is not blocked.\"\n\nBy God, I am weary of postponement and repetition. From the many promises I have gained nothing but near delays and distant gifts. If you enact your resolve in granting, well—otherwise I enact my resolve in departing. This, my lord, is the first day of confrontation and the last day of review. Do not think me one cornered with no paths or lacking mounts. God is gentle, His care surrounds me, His provision is not withheld, and His door before me is never shut. Peace.\n\n\"Another Letter Explaining the Saying of Another\":\n\n\"A people whose promises are adorned… adorning speech and lies. Whoever hopes for their gifts always needs… three things without experiment: the treasures of Qārūn, if he possessed them; the lifespan of Noah; and the patience of Job.\"\n\nI complain to God, then to you, my lord—may God preserve your honor—of a people whose promises are adorned with the embellishments of falsehood and painted with the colors of deception. When a seeker comes to them for aid, he cannot wait for their bounty without three things: the treasures of Qārūn, unmatched in wealth; the lifespan of Noah, unmatched in length; and the patience of Job, unmatched in endurance. And God is the one sought for help against the burn of waiting and the anguish of need.\n\n\"Another Letter Explaining the Saying of Another\":\n\n\"You claim I am pleased while I am not… claim I am loyal though I was wronged. Claim I return in good condition… while necessity keeps me awake. For you have commanded, and so you care not… whether I am angered by your deeds or pleased. I will depart from you, clinging to despair… content with what gives me sustenance. Either the fortune of days will bring what I hope… or I will die. Such is the way of time, its cycles alternating… granting wealth and at times stripping it away. Many a man was rich after poverty… and many a wealthy one became homeless. If hope dies from hardship… God is alive and never dies.\"",

    "text": "I - may Allah support my master - preserve the veil of beauty so I do not tear it, and protect the water of the face so I do not spill it. I show satisfaction while I am angry, and thank while my heart is full of complaint. I claim that my master interceded for me with Time, and extended to me the hand of kindness, while he shunned me a shunning that left my state dry. I claim that I returned with red camels carrying white blessings, while necessity made lawful for me what Allah forbade, and I do not own among the people the dinner of the night nor the lunch of the day. My master - may Allah support him - is lofty with the nose of power, riding the mount of pride, going in the path of glory, not caring whether I was angry or pleased, failed or succeeded. Since the wine of wealth intoxicated him, so he transgressed and oppressed and was undutiful and did not observe the right, I will depart from him, riding the back of despair from him. I will hold fast to stillness and silence, and contentment with sustenance. Either a successful hope or a comforting death. Likewise is Time, its states are buckets (turns), and its filling is hopes and terms. Sometimes it benefits, sometimes it causes loss. At times it gives, at times it loots. How many a man the udders of wealth flowed for, and the clouds of wish rained upon, after he was a hostage of weakness and poverty, and a victim of humiliation and misery. How many an owner of wealth like dunes of sand has ended up in the most apparent straits, and revealed the ugliest poverty. If hope dies due to his bad condition, indeed Allah is Living, does not die. If what I hoped for is missed, Allah's making is not missed. Allah is sufficient for me alone, and He is the best Disposer of affairs.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Tammam regarding Abbas ibn Lahi'ah\"\n\"Fire, shame, hateful things, and destruction... Shackles, crucifixion, pliable spear, and wood.\nAre sweeter and more delicious than a gift you bestow... And you will not bestow it, O dog, O dog!\nYou made me complain, so when I complained of you... You got angry; may that discontent and anger last.\nO most of people in promise whose stuffing is breach... And most of people in speech all of which is lying.\nYou remained plundering the world and its decoration... And your honor remained an honor of evil being plundered.\"\nEvil and harm. Nakedness and mange. Shame and defect. Disgrace and Fire. Affliction and hardship, imprisonment and misery. Bad luck and calamity, and incurable disease. The strike of injustice upon the burning of separation, and the slap of humiliation upon the distress of estrangement, are more desirable and sweeter than a gift your hands bestow. And suffice you what I said, and enough. O dog of defects and ugliness, and O pig of disgraces and scandals. You made me complain, made me cry, harmed me, and humiliated me. When I complained, you were disturbed and ignited, and became sharp and heated. May your burning in the fire of anger and rage last, and your twisting on the bed of wrath and fury. O most of people in breach - and breach of promise is the character of the scoundrel - and most of them in speech in whose shoulders falsehood walks, and in whose doctrines lying hesitates. It suffices the liar that he says it as an insult while his heart is an adversary. You remained plundering the world and robbing, and attaining from it what you seek, while your honor is a target for plundering, and an example for cursing. May Allah not remove other than you, nor curse other than you. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Mas'ar to Abdullah ibn Tahir\"\n\"What do you say - may my soul be your ransom - regarding a man... Who rode determination in the bridle of patience?\nHe rises from the world over its rugged terrain... And settles from it in the place of travel.\nFinding pleasure at the door, his stay was long... So the leaf of the palace door wept for him.\"\nWhat is the saying of our Master the Prince - may Allah prolong his survival - regarding a man who rode to him the mount of determination bridled with firmness, saddled with decisive patience? He endured the horrors of travels, and penetrated the difficulties of rugged and rough paths, until he arrived at a watering place of your courtyard, and threw his staff at your door. He stuck to it finding pleasure, and went early and late to it repeatedly until his stay was long. His disease became incurable, and his cure became mighty and scarce. The virtuous people of the age pitied him, and the leaf of the palace almost wept for him. Is there with the Prince - may Allah support him - a look for him that holds his last breath which defect permeated, and steadies his foot which slipping possessed? For his opinion in that has its virtue which he is worthy of. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Untying the Answer to him by Abdullah ibn Tahir\"\n\"I did not forget your share, so seek help with patience... And open with my busyness from you the door of excuse.\nDo not despair if matters become difficult... For ease is expected during hardship.\"\nYou - may Allah strengthen you - know that Sultanic occupations may hinder brotherly rights. We do not forget the right of your service, nor what was paved and confirmed of your bond. So increase in patience, do not narrow in chest, and open for us the door of excuse until the door of thanks opens for you. Do not despair of two eases with the hardship. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Buhturi\"\n\"A cloud whose generosity missed me while it was pouring... And a sea whose flood passed me while it was bestowing.\nAnd a full moon that lit the earth east and west... While the place of my foot from it is black, dark.",

    "text": "Do I complain of his dew after it encompassed mankind... And who dispraises the rain except a dispraised one?\nFath ibn Khaqan did not prevent his gift... But it is Destinies that give and deprive.\"\nOur Master the Prince - may Allah prolong his survival - is a cloud all of which is rain, and its habit is aid. But it did not revive my land with a rain, nor wet my uvula with a drop. He - may Allah strengthen his victory - is a brimming sea, its flood is blessings. But I am thirsty in his neighborhood, deprived of his good traces. Just as he is a full moon that filled eyes with delight and filled the lands with brightness, yet the place of my look is empty of his light. By my life, it is unchangeable. Oh my wonder at thirst in the neighborhood of the swelling sea, and at darkness in facing the shining full moon. How \"?\" the generality of creation thanked him, and how do I dispraise one whom the tongue of Time praised? Who dispraises rain except a dispraised one, and who blames the sun except a blamed one? The Prince did not single me out for deprivation, for he has encompassed people with kindness. But Destinies give and deprive, and undo and establish. There is no despair of Allah's mercy, and no harm with Allah's grace. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"The thirsty seekers came so they returned... Quenched, and the watering place was pleasant for them with you.\nI came to your sea, swelling, overflowing... So I returned my bucket as a dry skin rattling.\nI see you raining on a side over a side... While the sky of my house from your tolerance is a barren land.\"\nI see the seekers - may Allah support our Master the Prince - intending his spacious courtyard and arriving at his sweet watering place. The watering place accommodates them with him, and the drinking place is pleasant for them. They return from him having quenched and watered, and narrated of his noble deeds what they saw. I arrived at his intended courtyard and his frequented sea. When I extended my glance to the fresh water and threw my bucket among the buckets, he returned the bucket dry, rattling, and dropped me into what I did not expect. I see him raining on sides, aiding relatives and strangers. My land is devoid of his rain, and my hand is empty of his white and yellow (silver and gold). Conditions may corrupt then improve, and the generous may be stingy then generous. With today is tomorrow, and with Saturday is Sunday. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Abu Hasan, what excuse do I and you have... In your sleeping regarding my affair and my thanks for the length of my life?\nDo you accept that I be satisfied, while you are my means... With other than satisfaction from the people of my time and from my time?\nI made you a sea for me and your palm a deep... And the neighbor of the sea thirsts on the coast of the sea!\"\nI wish I knew what your excuse is, O my master, in your sleeping regarding my affair and your abstinence in attracting my thanks. Why did you accept other than satisfaction in aiding me against my time, while you are my means from mankind and my intercessor to wealth? Among the wonders is that you are a full sea, and I am thirsty on your coast. Allah is the Helper.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"The forelocks of noble deeds are in your grasp... And these people are the sons of your blessing.\nThose branches of highness belong... If they belong, to your root.\nSo why was I left without a pasture... While this creation grazes in your blessing?\"\nOur Master - may Allah prolong his survival - has reached the furthest of high ranks and possessed the forelocks of noble deeds. Beauties are from the traces of his days, and people are the sons of his bounty. Branches of glory branch out from his lofty tree, and the tongue of Time preaches his consistent virtues. May Allah perpetuate for him the most abundant portion, just as He poured out by him the best blessings. To proceed: Why do I not take a share of his fertile courtyard, while people graze in the gardens of his blessing, and have what they wish of the fruits of his state? My rights require that I be with him in the group of those successful in their aims, winners of their demands; not that the world turns away from me while it is led by his command, and time disguises itself to me while it is in his hand. This is a flash of complaint, running the course of a reminder. It benefits the believers and is tolerated from the sincere. Behind it is what turns it into thanks and returns aversion into kindness. God willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"If there is in you (plural/fem) neither shade nor fruit... Then may Allah distance you of trees.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"If you have no world with you to benefit us... Nor are you possessor of religion so we hope for you for religion.\nAnd you were a friend not hoped for a gift... We made a friend in your likeness from clay.\"\nAnd the saying of Mansur al-Faqih:\n\"If you were stingy with my kindness... And I did not attain a support from you.\nAnd you are a slave like me... So why do I worship a slave?\"\nIf the tree did not clothe me with its shade nor give me its fruit, may Allah empower a cutter over its root and destine a woodcutter for its branch. If you are not hoped for benefit, nor benefitted from in matters of religion and the world, then you are nothing but a spirit in impossibility, nay a statue of clay. If I did not attain from you status and support, then you are a slave like me and I do not worship the slave. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"",

When the onlooker contemplates it.\nI would have depicted it for you so you see it... And know that I am a thankful man.\nBut it is dwelling in the conscience... Moved by the circulating speech.\"\nMy thanks to the High Assembly of our Master the King, the Lord, the Supported, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah prolong his survival, perpetuate his highness, and grant victory to his banner - for his blessings which drowned me and enslaved me, and filled my hand and my heart, is the thanks of the garden for the rain and the night-traveler for the moon. Rather, the thanks of the thirsty arriving for the cold fresh water. Rather, the thanks of the captive for his liberator and the slave for his emancipator. If thanks had a person the sight perceives and the look obtains, I would have depicted it and perfected its depiction, just as I established it and perfected its establishment, so that our Master - may Allah strengthen his victory - sees it with his high eye as he heard it with his conscious ear. So he knows that I am thankful for his favors connected like the connection of fortunes, remembering his kindnesses organized like the organization of necklaces. Even if thanks dwelt in the depth of my soul and the core of my heart, what circulates of my speech as proverbs and travels in the horizons as imagination has moved it. Upon Allah I seek help to rise to the obligatory of thanking the blessing and exerting capacity in service. He is the best Helper and strongest Supporter.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"Do not deny the blessing to the possessor of blessings... He does not thank Allah who does not thank people.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"I thanked you, for thanks to Allah is obedience... And whoever thanks for the favor, Allah increases him.\nFor every time there is one who is followed... And this is a time you are undoubtedly its unique one.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"The Prince equaled our days with his generosity... So all of them for all of us are festivals.\nAs for our reality, we are his slaves... But in his kindness, we are children.\"\nThanks - may Allah support our Master the King, the Lord Khwarazm Shah - is obedience to Allah, a bond for the blessing, and a key for increase. I will surely thank the Benefactor, the Patron of Blessings - may Allah perpetuate his authority - the extent of my words, and I will surely praise him to the capacity of my pen. Whoever does not thank creation does not thank his Creator, and whoever does not praise his Provider. For every time there is one who is followed in noble deeds by his character, and guided in high ranks by his ways. Our Master - may Allah perpetuate his support - is the unique of his time, and the peerless among his peers. He has equaled between our days with his blessings and the traces of his generosity and kindness. All of them are a witnessed Friday and numbered festivals. We are in reality his slaves truly, and his property by bondage. But in his kindness to us, his compassion upon us, and his looking after us, we are the dearest children of the most generous father. May he never cease to be of glory between inherited and newly acquired. Among the wonders is that the father is fresh of youth, good of reception, and at a far extent from middle age, while among his children are those whom greyness has bridled with its bridle and led with its rein. Among them are those who passed youth by stages and arrived at the watering places of old age. Among them are those of high ages and companionship to the past days. So may Allah prolong the survival of our Master, victorious, lucky, and by the eye of His care noticed and protected, until he reaches the utmost age and the highest command, and possesses what the sun rose upon and the blowing of the wind ended at. Amen.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"I will surely thank you for a favor you intended... Indeed, intention for favor is a favor.\nAnd I do not blame you if destiny did not execute it... For the thing is diverted by the inevitable destiny.\"",

I thank him for what he intended of my well-known affair, and what he resolved of reaching me with kindness and favor. I do not blame him if destiny did not aid him in reaching what he sought, and judgment did not help him in executing what he wanted. Most judgments and destinies run contrary to preference and estimation. Things are by inevitable destiny estimated and facilitated, or hindered and delayed. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"I pledged my hand to inability to thank his kindness... And there is no increase above my thanks to the thankful.\nIf it were something possible, I would have done it... But what is not possible is severe.\"\nI - may Allah support our Master - am a hostage of inability to thank him and falling short of spreading his kindness. Although my thanks has no increase for an increaser, nor beyond it a limit for an exaggerator. The incapable, if he admits, is a winner. If thanking him were something possible, I would have done it, and broadcast it in gatherings and spread it. But what is not possible is excused, and the excuse in that is conceivable. God willing.\n\n\"Verse\"\n\"I speak of some of what you bestowed upon me... And you gave me request before requests.\nIf I were able, everyone above the dust... Would have stood on my behalf thanking you.\"\nI - may Allah support him - thank some of what his kindness and virtue encompassed me with, since there is no hope in reaching the obligatory of thanking all of it, and publishing what he entitled me to of the gift before asking and requesting. If I were able, everyone above the dust would have thanked him on my behalf for his favors which are more than the number of dust (particles). But I ask Allah, Exalted is His Name, to undertake his reward on my behalf, and help his deed and intention in good, and to keep him for the beautiful to populate its paths, and the good to bear its results, by His mercy and the breadth of His grace.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"And when your kindness was above my thanks...

Referred you in reward to the Capable.\"\nOur Master the King, the Lord, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah prolong his survival - has prolonged the rein of favoring in my affair, poured upon me the cloud of preference, and extended to me the hand of bounty, until I took over the furthest desire. When his kindness was above my thanks, and the amount of his fragrance greater than my ability, and his place in kingship and authority greater than for the like of me to thank him, I turned from thanks and praise to knocking on the door of heaven with supplication. I desired of Allah, Great is His Majesty and Holy are His Names - the desire of the incapable of the Capable, the weak of the Strong, and the poor of the Rich - that He undertakes rewarding him on my behalf with the best of what He rewarded a benefactor for a thankful one, and a doer of good for a publisher. It secured me from falling short and negligence, and hanging onto the tails of excuses, that I referred him to the Capable of reward, the Able to recompense. He is the One asked, Exalted, to spread the hand with highness, couple the grandfather (luck) with happiness, and make his two days his tomorrow.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Mahmud al-Warraq\"\n\"If a glorious one dispensed with thanks... Due to pride of soul or highness of place.\nAllah would not have ordered servants to thank Him... So He said: Thank Me, O two heavy ones (Jinn and Mankind).\"\nThanks - may Allah support you - is loved, desired, and sought. If a glorious one were above it due to the highness of his status, or a king due to the elevation of his authority, Allah would not have ordered His servants to thank Him and talk of His blessing and kindness.\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Convey to our brother - may Allah take charge of his company - that I... Even if I do not meet him, I meet him.\nAnd that my heart is connected to seeing him... Even if his dwelling is far from my dwelling.\nNo blessing arrived at me nor a hadith...

And the rain is counted and his gifts are not counted.\nAllah knows that I do not mention him... And how does he mention who does not forget him?\nMay Allah show me what my heart attempts...

How can I not spread the sides of my chest for his love, and not hold onto his loyalty with my hand and fingernail?

I do not see around me a beautiful abundant grant, and a massive great favor, except that I attained it from the year of his bounty and the next, and the drizzle of his kindness and its downpour. He is in his generosity nothing but the overflowing sea and the abundant rain. However, the sea, its water gets cut off, while his giving is not cut off. And the rain is counted, while his favors are not counted. Allah knows that I see him in the mirror of thought. I do not mention because I do not forget.

He overtook me in the tremors of dilemmas until he rescued me from the fangs of calamities. He dressed me in a shield of ample tails, prudent of width and length, and a weapon whose appearance pleases and whose substance frightens, whose singing is good and whose trace is ugly. He girded me with a sword whose like is rare and scarce. So I called out to the vicissitudes of Time: Who is the one who emerges? I will surely thank him like the breaths of gardens at dawns after rains. And I will surely desire to Allah Almighty that He prolongs his survival and improves his reward on my behalf.\n\n\"Another on Untying his Saying also\"\n\"To the family of Sulayman ibn Wahb are favors... Upon me, and kindness to me that preceded.\nThey taught the days how to treat me kindly... And they washed the blood from my father's robe.\"\nThe family of Sulayman have successive favors upon me like the succession of rain on the desolate land, and consecutive blessings like the succession of wealth to the poor. Preceding and following favors, and coming and awaited hands. They are the ones who shortened the road to obtaining my wish, and comforted me while I was like a stranger in my homeland. They taught the days how to treat me kindly, and how to heal me and please me. They are the ones who cleared my watering places of turbidity, and washed the blood from my father's robe, until I attained through them the sleep-inducing revenge, and shook hands with victory and bliss. May Allah reward them on my behalf with the best of what He rewarded an initiator of kindness and a reviver of a human.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Tammam\"\n\"You sufficed me the sufficiency of water in choking... And you were the originator of the downpour of the abundant cloud.\nYou renewed for me a hope whose wonders were...

For I fear from it for my neck.\"\nThe trace of the virtue of our Master the King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah prolong his survival - with me is like the trace of water with choking. The location of his bounty with me is like the location of guidance with the confused. Long has he created for me with his known generosity and described kindness a cloud of dewy shade, pleasant downpour and drizzle. My garden laughs from its weeping, and my land turns green from its blackness. Until he renewed for me of my hope what wore out, and verified for me of my thought what failed. I say: If his character were in a solid stone, it would overflow with extending water. Or in thorns, they would wear the robe of roses. He is nothing but a person entirely glory and generosity. There is no beauty in the world except it exists in his character. How many a majestic blessing and heavy favor of his, I lighten with thanks but it becomes heavy, and I overcome with spreading but it overcomes and kills. By Allah, lift its weight, for I feared from it for my back that it splits and cuts, and for my neck that it breaks and dislocates. Allah is the Helper on thanks that runs the course of the breeze for his blessings, and indicates my place among his slaves and servants.

They will not do evil, praise be to Allah, in the future.\"\nThe anger of our Master - may Allah perpetuate his support - is the anger of the soul against the body, and the cutting of the liver by the hand of grief. There has shaded me from that what showed me the light of the world as darkness, and depicted the light of the sun in my eye as gloom. How many a night whose pavilion is extended and the door of its morning is closed, I revived with supplication while it kills me with weeping. When its chest passed and its half ended, I said, having worn the robe of the humble and fulfilled the conditions of the submissive, forgetting the pledge of sleep while I am in prostration: O Knower of the unseen, O Coverer of defects, O Forgiver of sins, O Turner of hearts. Bless Muhammad, the best of those with whose mention supplications are opened, and by blessings upon whom requests succeed. Inspire Your Caliph in Your earth and Your trustee over Your creation, satisfaction with two poor servants of his, submissive to confession of their sins. The vicissitudes of days have duelled to prey on them, and their fangs hastened to seize them. They are on a brink and exposure to destruction. Even if each of them sinned and deserved punishment, he has repented, apologized, and turned back. Apology necessitates forgiveness, and repentance demolishes the sin. If he did evil in what passed of his time, he will not return to evil in what remains of his life.

And your servant, and service has a sanctity. Your vizier, and the vizierate has a covenant.

In the pardon of our Master - may Allah perpetuate his support - for his servant is a shelter for the virtue which is from him. I have come with what I deserve of error and evil, so let him come with what he merits of hoped-for pardon. Let him consider me sinning as he said; then why did he not forgive? And why did he not do good and beautiful, and pardon and favor, so that he has the mentioned virtue and the thanked pardon? If I am not worthy of the beautiful with the evil of what I came with and the ugliness of what I committed, he is worthy of it with his brilliant generosity and widespread glory. It is incumbent upon him to forgive my slip, raise me from my stumble, combine in pardoning me thanks and reward, and not leave me to seek means by excuse. For perhaps I will not perform it at the time of need and in the position of argument. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"",

    "text": "\"Suppose I did evil as you claimed... Then where is the affection of brotherhood?\nAnd if I did evil as I did evil... Then where is your virtue and chivalry?\"\nSuppose, O my master - may Allah prolong your survival - I slipped; and the scholar whom I do not rival may slip. And I stumbled; and the generous horse whom I do not race may stumble. And I did evil; and the doer of good whom I do not equal may do evil. Where is the affection of brotherhood whose covenant is not rejected, and the sanctity of friendship whose bond is not diminished? If you repaid me for the evil, where is your virtue upon which the sphere of glory revolves, and where is your chivalry to which the hand of highness points? Here I have fled from you to you, and sought help by your pardon against you. So make me taste the sweetness of your satisfaction and favor, just as you made me taste the bitterness of your anger and revenge. Know, without being taught, that my sin, even if great, your pardon is greater than it. I do not have, praise be to Allah, a sin that your forgiveness is too narrow for. The noble is he who, if he is able, forgives; if he possesses, is gentle; if he captures, frees; and if he binds, releases. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz\"\n\"O my master, I have stumbled, take my hand... And do not leave me nor say 'Perish'.\nAnd pardon, if I return, then pardon a second time... For the doctor treats the one who relapsed.\"\nI complain to my master - may Allah perpetuate his glory - of the stumble of my foot and the abundance of my regret. I ask him to take my hand and not say to me 'Perish', but revive me and dress me in the robe of his pardon for me. If I return to the sin, let him return to the pardon. If I return to turbidity, let him return to clarity. Allah may pardon the repetition of evil which the soul commands, and the doctor treats the one who relapses after his recovery. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Nuwas\"\n\"Months have passed for me since I was imprisoned, three... As if I had sinned what is not forgiven.\nIf I did not sin, then why is my imprisonment... And if I was a possessor of sin, then your pardon is greater.\"\nI have been immersed - may Allah prolong our Master's survival - for three months in the bottom of a prison whose effect on the soul is bad, and which blocks the light of the sun from me. As if my sin is the grave sin with which beautiful forgiveness is ugly. Our Master - may Allah perpetuate his support - obliges pardon at the slip, just as he commits to giving at the request. If I am innocent, then the truth accommodates me and justice includes me. If I am a sinner, then the pardon of our Master - may Allah perpetuate his power - is greater than my sin, and his noble sympathy overtakes me. God Almighty willing.\n\nChapter\nAcceptance of Excuse\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"Accept the excuses of one who comes to you apologizing... Whether he was truthful with you in what he said or lied.\nFor he who pleases you outwardly has obeyed you... And he who disobeys you hiddenly has respected you.\"\nConfession removes the commission (of sin). Apology necessitates forgiveness, whether the excuse was a lie or truth, false or true. He who hid has feared you, and he who apologized to you did not sin against you. The noble is he who makes trust in his friend prevail over doubt in his verification.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz\"\n\"It was said to me: So-and-so did evil to you... And the staying of a youth upon injustice is a shame.\nI said: He came to us and created an excuse... The blood money of the sin with us is apology.\"\nSome of those who eat food with me and suckle wine with me said to me in these days: My pledge with so-and-so is doing evil to you, committing crimes against you. I see him now accompanying you and not separating from you, intermingling with you and not leaving you. Requital is obligatory in nature and permissible in Sharia. It is a shame for a youth to overlook the mote (in the eye) and stay upon injustice and harm. I said: Did you not know that he came to me apologizing to me, shedding tears of seeking favor before me, and acting with gentle speech and elegant excuse in what, if Time came with its like, it would pardon its vicissitudes and secure the feared from its danger? Apology, even if little, is the blood money of the sin, even if great.\n\nChapter\nComplaint\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Abu al-Fath Kushajim\"\n\"I used to fight the doubt of Time... In days when his eyes were sleeping.\nWhen he woke up, I made peace with him... And whoever fears his assault makes peace with him.\nI used to covet his moon... So I became content with the hilt (or remaining part).\"\nI used to fight the doubt of Time, assault it with sword and spear, and extract justice from it with the utmost possibility, in days when his eye was sleeping, his fire was extinguished, and his wind was stagnant. When he woke up and growled at me and became lion-like, and gathered to oppose me and crowded, and prepared to reveal enmity to me and sought help, I inclined to peace seeking safety. I became content from the moon with the hilt, and satisfied from the spoil with safety in return. Allah is the Granter of success to the right.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Hiffan\"\n\"O this woman, how much will the blame and criticism be... Do not blame a man whose clothes are shreds.\nIf I enter evening alone, then the sea is alone... And the full moon is alone and the sword is alone.",

    "text": "If the vicissitude of a time faulted his appearance... Then between his two rags is a crushing lion.\"\nYou knew what passed between me and a blaming woman who saw me alone, not keeping company with anyone, wearing rags that had thinned, and recited \"When the sky splits open\". So she blamed me for isolation from loved ones and wearing worn-out clothes. I said to her: As for isolation, I have a model in it in the swelling sea, the shining full moon, and the sharp sword. As for rags, a man is not known by his cloak, just as a sword is not known by its sheath. Even if the vicissitude of Time robbed me of wealth so I wore rags, between them is a crushing lion from me, and he will have a victorious luck. With today is tomorrow, and with hardship is ease. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Di'bil\"\n\"I went and I do not know where I go... And which matters in determination I ride.\nIf my two palms touched an organized necklace... Of pearls, it became perforated shells.\nIf my palm grasped a palm of a dirham... A scorpion would return to my leg while in the palm.\"\nI have no expression suitable to describe what I am in of confusion in my ways, difficulty in my demands, and the craft that showed me the door of good blocked and the face of hope blackened. If I touched a pearl, it would become a brick. If I took a gold nugget, it would become a dung pellet. If I took a dirham that benefits, it would turn into a scorpion that stings. There is no complaint of Allah but to Him, and my reliance is only on Him.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Time was unjust to us in its disposal... And which time did not run against the free?\nI have from Time what if its ease... Were thrown on the rotating sphere, it would not rotate.\"\nI complain to you of a time sharp of nail, mean of victory, unjust of march, loose of the reins of change. It has encompassed the free with its famous injustice, and assaulted them with its drawn sword. It humiliated them and removed them, and shifted their conditions from grace and bliss. It singled me out from the bitterness of its fruit and the badness of its effect with what, if thrown on the spheres, they would not rotate, or on the stars, they would not move, or on the mountains, they would sway, or on the seas, they would sink. Allah is the Helper against the harshness of Time.\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"I see the time of griefs stopped upon me... So why do I not see the time of joys?\nMy days increase Time in length... So oh my sorrow for a short time.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"I wish I knew, will I spend a night... As the overnight of one happy of gift, pleased with Time?\nAnd do I have from the days a day bringing glad tidings... Of bestowing a favor or rewarding a possessor of favors?\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"He for whom the world was a wealth... We are of the spectators of the world.\nWe glance at it from near with regret... As if we are a word without meaning.\"\nWhy, my master - may Allah prolong your survival - do I see the time of worries eating my flesh and griefs drinking my blood, and not see the time of joys for which my side shakes, and happiness with which my wit rises? Why do I see days longer than the nights of lovers when they are shot with the arrows of separation? Oh my sorrow for a time whose darknesses are lights and whose long times are short. I wish I knew, will I spend a night as one sleeps whose luck is happy, whose fire stick ignited, whose command rose, and whose time pleased him? Do I have a day in which I am able to bestow a blessing, or repel a vengeance, or reward a possessor of a favor, or treat a brother of ordeal? As for now, in this world described with freshness, I am among the spectators. I glance at it right and left, and see nothing but worry and regret. I see nothing but one of eclipsed mind, suffering, as if I am a word without meaning. What makes you know? Perhaps relief is near, and Allah allots me a share of good.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Buhturi\"\n\"Whoever praises or dispraises his time... This one, I am not praising Time.\nPoverty like the poverty of Prophets, estrangement... And ardent love; the affliction is not one.\"\nAnd the saying of Al-Khalil, also narrated for Al-Hamdawi:\n\"I did not increase in my literature a letter I rejoice with... Except I increased a letter under which is bad luck.\nIndeed the one advanced in skill in his craft... Wherever he turns from it, he is deprived.\"",

    "text": "I, my master - may Allah support you - am praising Allah in all states, but not praising treacherous Time. For it was not content for me with single ordeals until it made them pairs, and poured upon me waves from the whip of torment. It afflicted me with poverty like the poverty of Prophets, estrangement exposing me to hardships, and ardent love exposing me to tribulation. The matter is that I do not increase a letter of literature except I increase a letter (of bad luck). Nor do I memorize a line except I wear poverty. Nor do I master a known (fact) except I know bad luck. Likewise, the one advanced in skill in his craft, pointed to for the virtue of his brilliance, wherever he turns he is deprived, and however he excels he is dispraised. The prudent is he who affirms what pleases him in Allah's grace and blessing, and refers what grieves him to Allah's power and wisdom. I hope to be that with Allah's help and will.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Professor Abu Bakr al-Khawarizmi\"\n\"I have a thin shirt... Which illusions tear.\nAnd a Jubbah (cloak) not equal to... Its misspelling (Jannah/Paradise or Hayyah/Snake?), and farewell.\"\nThe generosity of my master - may Allah perpetuate his glory - does not approve for me in this frowning, calamitous winter, and the cold baring to me the fang of severe cold (Zamharir), that I go and come in worn-out clothes like thin air and shimmering mirage. The shirt, nothing remains of it but the name, and illusion tears it. The Jubbah, wear has become its ally and intimate; it does not equal its misspelling. The turban, if the breeze of air blows on it, almost gets organized in the thread of dust particles. If you clothe me in a robe that is beautiful in the eyes, I will clothe you in a robe that is beautiful in ears and hearts. God willing.\n\nChapter\nOn Expecting Relief\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"Do not panic even if you become insolvent one day... For you have been solvent in the long time.\nDo not despair, for despair is disbelief... Perhaps Allah enriches from a little.\nDo not think of your Lord an evil thought... For Allah is more worthy of the beautiful.\nI saw hardship followed by ease... And the saying of Allah is the truest of all sayings.\"\nIt reached me, my master - may Allah support you - that you panic from the choking of Time, and do not wear the garment of patience over hardship. As if the cycles did not turn upon you, night and day did not discipline you, and news and traces did not pass by your eye and ear. As if you do not return from patience to the best equipment, nor look into the book of relief after distress. Do you not know that if you were insolvent for a month, you were solvent for an epoch? If you practiced hardship for days, you wore blessing for years. Just as the period of joy did not last, the period of harm does not last. Just as the turn of the gift did not tarry, the turn of the ordeal does not tarry. Do not despair of the mercy of Allah, for despair is disbelief, and with hardship is ease. It is as if Allah has removed your harm and tribulation, enriched you and satisfied you, and given you your wish. So do not be among those thinking of Allah an evil thought, for He, Exalted, is more worthy of the beautiful. Do not be among the despondent, for He, Mentioned is His Greatness, relieves shortly. His saying, Majestic is His Glory, is the truest saying. Wait, my master, for the exit from tightness to breadth, and from disturbance to tranquility. Rejoice in a satisfied life and sufficient blessing. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Perhaps a relief Allah will bring; indeed... He has every day a command in His creation.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"Perhaps the Mender of the broken bone, by His bounty... Will prepare for the broken bone, so it mends.\nPerhaps Allah... Do not despair of Allah, indeed He... Makes easy with Him what is great and big.\"\nIf you are, O my master - may Allah keep you - between a lying-in-wait ordeal and an intending calamity, suffering from them mote in your eye, choking in your throat, and harm in your heart; rather enduring what if it passed by iron would melt, or by a newborn would turn grey. Perhaps Allah brings a relief that mends your break, enriches your poverty, and fixes your affair. Do not despair of Allah, for every difficulty, if He eases it, becomes easy. His command, if He wills a thing, is only that He says to it, 'Be,' and it is.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of some Alawites\"\n\"Behind the strait of fear is the breadth of safety... And the beginning of what is rejoiced at is the end of sadness.\nSo do not despair, for Allah made Joseph possess... His storehouses after release from prison.\"\nYou know, my master - may I be your ransom - that behind the tightness of fear is the breadth of safety, and that the beginning of joy is the end of sadness. So do not despair of a relief that clears the flood of your distress and raises the star of your joy. For Allah brought Joseph out from the humiliation of slavery to the glory of freedom, and from the distress of exhausting imprisonment to the spirit of pleasing kingship. Many a matter was hard then became easy, and difficult then softened.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Move your wishes if you are distressed...

And that possessors of literature among people were wasted.\nAnd that Kings, no one enjoys favor with them... Among people except one who sings and is slapped.\nTheir tambourines are populated with their instruments... While their mosque is empty of people, barren.\nOh would that I had become a singer among them... And was not miserable with what I was gathering.\"\nSuffice it as sadness that chivalry has been wasted, youthfulness nullified, and possessors of literature lost due to lack of seekers. Most Kings are oblivious, playful, boasting of singers and those who are slapped. Their gatherings of intimacy are populated and flooded with amusements, and their mosques are abandoned. Oh would that I were a singer for them so I attain the wish, and realize wealth by singing, and was not miserable by gathering sciences, mastering the known, and wearing the robe of the deprived.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Professor Abu Bakr al-Khawarizmi\"\n\"Living turned away and the system was cut... And meanness lived when the mean lived.\nTime left me behind upon people... If they imitated dogs, they would be noble.\nTime almost insults me explicitly... If Time had speech.\nWere it not that I dispute the decree of my Lord... I would have said: I ransom my death, and farewell.\"\nThe joy of living has turned away, the system of freedom cut off, the trace of humanity erased, the sphere of chivalry stopped, the days of the noble ended, and meanness lived by the life of the mean. Time left me behind upon people who, if they imitated dogs, would be the noblest of the noble. If Time spoke, it would pelt me with arrows of insult just as it intended me with its blameworthy actions. Were it not that I dispute the decree of Allah, before which there is no veil or defense, nor caution or prevention, I would have insulted this low world, wished for death, shortened speech, and said: I ransom my death, and farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying his Saying also\"\n\"The fire of highness died down after ignition... And Good shouted: Come to demise.\nWe lacked generosity except in wishes... And except in pages and dictations.\nOh would that notebooks were people... So creation would become rich from the nobility of deeds.\nIf I were made a commander of an army... I would not fight except by begging.\nBecause people are defeated by it... While they stood firm for the tips of spears.\"\nDid you not see highness, how its firebrand died down and its horse stumbled? And Good, how it signaled demise and its saddles were tied for departure? And Generosity, how it became helpless, mighty, and scarce? Except in notebooks and books of news and exploits. Oh would that books were people, so their faces would be for beauty, their tongues for eloquence, and their hands for tolerance. If I were a commander of an army filling the earth, charging its length and width, and it occurred to me to rise against an enemy who showed the page of open hostility and rode the back of opposition, so he gathered and mustered, joined and spread, collected his sides and wrapped his wraps; I would not fight him except by begging, from which the heroes of men are defeated, while long they stood firm for sharp swords and long spears.\n\n\"A Note on Untying the Saying of Ibn Lankak\"\n\"A time in which generosity became mighty (scarce) until... Generosity became in the highest towers.\nThe free passed away, became extinct, perished... And Time left me behind upon louts.\nThey said: You have stuck to the house strictly... I said: Due to the loss of benefit in going out.\"\nYou blamed me, my master - may I be your ransom - for sticking to the house, and said that the living, if he does not go out of it, is like the dead. As if you do not know that going out, if it is useless, isolation is the best sitter. Especially in this time when the generosity of the wealthy has become scarce until it became in the highest towers of the sky. The free passed away, so no fire-blower nor lighthouse-raiser remained of them. I remained among louts whose hidden nature baffled every treatment. They protect their pennies and degrade their souls. Do you blame me for hating them and continuing to diminish and reject them? I have no doubt that if you knew them, you would excuse me as you blamed me. God willing.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Rumi\"\n\"I saw Time raising every scoundrel... And lowering every possessor of noble traits.\nLike the sea, pearls sink in it...

And pearls settle in its furthest bottom?\nWe, even if the hands of Time tampered with us... And harm touched us from the persistence of its misery.\nIn the sky are stars that have no number... And none is eclipsed except the sun and the moon.\"\nYou reproached us - may Allah support you - with the vicissitudes of Time and confusion between its fangs and claws. Has Time opposed anyone but those of danger and the notables of the free? Its habit has always been raising the mean and lowering the noble, fighting the virtuous and making peace with the vile. Until it was compared to the sea in which fresh pearls sink and dirty carrion floats above. Even if Time singled us out with its massive accidents and excused others from its great calamities, in the sky are stars that cannot be counted by calculation, and none of them is eclipsed except the luminaries (sun and moon). This is a sufficient summary. Farewell.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of...\"\n\"This is the time which we were warned of... In what Ka'b and Ibn Mas'ud narrate.\nIf this lasts and no change happens to it... No dead will be wept for, nor a newborn rejoiced with.\"\nThis time has many wonders, not few calamities. Waker of fitnas (strife), not putting ordeals to sleep. It speaks only with complaint and is silent only upon tribulation. It is the time which long warned us of its evil and cautioned us against its harm. How many a non-rejected hadith came to us in it from Ka'b al-Ahbar and Ibn Mas'ud. By Allah, if what we see of the appearance of corruption and the prevalence of injustice in the lands lasts, the situation will surely turn to congratulating on death and condoling on births. Allah is the Helper against this time.\n\nChapter\nSeeking Increase of Brothers\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"I became a stranger asking whoever appeared to me... Of people: Is there a truthful friend?\nThey said: Two dear ones that are not found... A truthful friend and the eggs of the Anuq (bird).\"\nI am a man who has long been estranged, gone east and west, until as if I am a mote or painful kohl in the eye of the earth, and the successor of Khidr in traversing land and sea. My lost property sought in my travels, and the most important wish of my wishes, is a truthful friend I rely upon, lean on, and seek support from. I never asked about him an intelligent or clever person, and a wise man of letters, except he said: That is rarer than the pied eagle, and than the eggs of the Anuq. Yes, and than the red-footed crow and red sulfur.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Indeed, my friend is the one who strives for my benefit... And my beloved is not the one who wants my misery.\nIf I see misery with my loved ones... I see my prosperity with my enemies.\nCure nor removal of illness is hoped for...

So say: Where does he run who chokes on water?\"\nMy friend is the one who is truthful to me, whose intention is pure for me, and who wants good for me. Not the one whom my offense pleases and my misery delights. If I see misery from my loved ones, I hope for satisfaction from my enemies. If the disease is from the direction of the medicine, the causes of cure are delayed. To his brother a human flees, and with water the choking one seeks help. If he chokes on water, in what does he seek aid? And if a man is attacked from his brother, in whom does he seek help?\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Uff and Tuff to one whose affection...

It is only that he recovers from the illness of poverty, takes off the robe of distress, the resources of his money expand, and the branches of his condition branch out, until he drags the tail of pride over his brother, and does not observe the pact of friendship in him. He places himself in the rank of Saturn, and thinks his brother below him in station. That is the one by which the chest narrows and for which patience does not expand. So no friend became solvent after hardship, nor attained above nourishment the weight of an atom.

The house of the Caliph and the Vizier.\nIf I ate a little piece of bread... And drank from the water of the pool.\nThen I am the Caliph, not the one... By whom the top of the throne is raised.\nIndeed, the little if it is pure... And suffices, substitutes for the much.\"\nYou blamed me, O my master and lord - may Allah perpetuate your glory - for satisfaction with subsistence and sitting back from the service of kings and nobles. As if you do not know that I took contentment as a craft, and made it secretly a merchandise. I saw isolation as a formidable glory, and sticking to the house as a high rank. By Allah, my little house, despite the smallness of its yard, the shortness of its building, the narrowness of my living, and the scarcity of my furniture, is dearer to me and more preferred by me than the house of the Caliph, which is the sister of Paradise from which houses are shy and palaces fall short. And (dearer) than the house of the Vizier which contains what souls desire and eyes delight in. If I settle in my house, wear my rags, eat a little piece of bread from Halal, and drink an unleavened drink from fresh water, then I am the Prince, not the one by whom the throne is lifted. I am the Caliph, not the one to whom creation submits. It is of my doctrine that what is pure and sufficient of the little stands in for the abundant much. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abdullah ibn Tahir\"\n\"How is the life of a man who has every day... A flag spread before a town?\nAnd if the wind moves the sound of a drum... From afar, his heart is terrified.\nO one rich from armies and the mission... Congratulations to you on the comfortable resting place.\nWhoever has a piece of bread, living from people... Rich with it, then that is the Prince.\"\nI see the subjects envying the shepherds (rulers) and governors if they see their beauties, and envying masters and leaders if they wish for their places. They do not know what is in the exterior of their conditions of internal horrors, and what is in those lofty ranks of hidden perils. They overlook what is in the whiteness of blessings of the redness of blood, and in the ease of life of the crime of the army. What is the life of one who exposes himself to tribulation and rubs against hardship in conquering the lands of enemies? He has every day spread flags and drawn swords. If the drum speaks, his heart palpitates, and if the clamor rises, his mind flies. O you who are dispensed from leading armies generally and specifically, and from mobilizing troops as a solid structure. O you whom Allah sufficed the clashing of swords and the confronting of deaths. Congratulations to you on the favored shade and the comfortable resting place. Know that whoever has subsistence and chastity, and his drink is pure and his flock safe, then he is the Prince even if flags do not flutter over him and mandates do not continue for him. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad to Sulayman ibn Habib ibn al-Muhallab\"\n\"Convey to Sulayman that I am in spaciousness from him... And in richness, except that I am not a possessor of money.\nPoverty is in the soul not in money, we know it... Likewise the matter of richness is in the soul not the money.\nIf Sulayman was stingy with his gift... Then Allah is the most generous asked one for a asker.\"\nAnd the saying of Mansur al-Faqih:\n\"Everyone in this world... Of people is few.\nAnd the least of people is the one whom... The little from it does not satisfy.\"",

    "text": "I, O my master - may Allah support you - despite my distress and the bad effect of my poverty, am in spaciousness and richness from Sulayman. I praise Allah the Manan. For richness is the richness of hearts not the richness of wealth. Likewise, poverty is in souls not in conditions. If Sulayman was stingy with his gift and ran on his habit in depriving his asker, then Allah is the best hoped for and the most generous asked one. He is the Generous who is not stingy, and the Forbearing who does not hasten. You have known that whoever settles for the world has worn the robe of the humiliated, and the most humiliated of people is he who is not satisfied with the little. Often I say: Whoever is not content with the little is a captive of the wealthy. Farewell.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Muhammad ibn Bashir\"\n\"For me to push through days of nakedness with worn clothes... And suffice from much provision with the hung (scant).\"\n\"Is better and more honorable for me than to see favors... Everlasting from mean people on my neck.\"\nIt is of my doctrine that pushing through days with worn clothes and rough food is better than wearing the necklaces of favors of the mean. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Contentment of the soul follows it with comfort... And the greed of a man brings him near to humiliation.\nGreed is not an increaser in sustenance... Nor is slackness a decreaser of it.\"\nIn contentment is the rest of the soul and the protection of the face. Man's greed is a bringer of humiliation. His greed and striving do not increase a man's sustenance, just as his slackness and negligence do not decrease it.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"If I am satisfied from Time that... I attain subsistence and a right living.\nThen the rich and the poor... And the stingy and the generous.\nAre equal to me, so why do I humble myself to one who does not give... And give the leadership?\"\nIf I walked the paths of guidance and correctness, and was satisfied from Time with subsistence and payment, then equal to me are the rich and the poor, the great and the small, the generous who is the companion of generosity and its friend, and the stingy who is the colleague of stinginess and its guest. So why do I humble myself to one who acts mightily over me, and give the leadership to one who does not do good to me? Whoever I dispense with, I am his equal, and whoever I need, I am his captive. Peace be upon the other.\n\nChapter\nOn Sustenance\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"O rider of the night and horrors and destruction... Do not tire yourself, for sustenance is not by movement.\nDo you not see the sea and the fisherman standing... In his night while the stars of the night are entangled?\nHe has gathered his limbs while the wave beats him... And his eye is between the eyes of the chest of the net.\nUntil when he became happy with his desire... And the whale had blocked the skewer of the one who hooked it.\nIt came to you with him pure without turbidity... So you became owning it more than the one who owned it.\nA making from Allah, He gives this by the trick of that... This one hunts and this one eats the fish.\"\nO my master - may Allah support you - you cease not to survey the edges of stages, ride the horrors of watering places, endure distances farther than your hopes, and tread unknown lands that overlook destruction with you. As if you do not know that sustenance is divided and the greedy is deprived, and that sustenance is not by movement and fatigue, and bearing hardship and toil. So gently, O my master, and kindly. Reduce your toil and decrease your seriousness and effort. Do not be like the fisherman of the whale who suffers for the happiness of another with it. Do you not see him how he advances on the sea and risks his life while the night has lowered its curtains and dragged its tails over him? The wave takes him and leaves him, and terror narrows on him and widens. His eye is on the net and his concern is catching the fish. Until when he catches it with the sweat of the brow and swallows the two bitters (calamities), it comes to you pure without turbidity, and gives it to you pardoned without danger. That is only from the making of Allah who gifts properties to His servants, and provides for this one by the striving of that one. So this one hunts wretched, meeting (hardship), and this one eats wholesomely, pleasantly. Blessed be the Wise Creator and Glory be to the Generous Provider.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Man strives and sustenance strives seeking him... So perhaps they differed in striving and seeking.\nUntil when the Merciful estimated their meeting... For agreement, sustenance came to him from near.\"\nTo you, O my master and lord, is a hadith. You see a man seeking sustenance while it seeks him hastily. Perhaps they differed, so this one went east and that one went west, and the face of deprivation appeared there. Perhaps they agreed, so sustenance called out answering, and success happened nearby. If Allah wills a matter, its causes agree, and if He does not decree a thing, its seeking becomes impossible.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"If sustenances run upon creatures... With justice, my sustenance will overtake me running.\nAnd if sustenances run upon them... With generosity, I hope He will be generous to us also.\"",

And if they run upon them by injustice - and far be it from Allah - I hope He will be generous to me also, and not break His habit with me.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"If you know that your Lord is a Creator... And you worshipped a creature, then you are not a believer.\nOr if you were in doubt regarding the sustenance which... The God guaranteed, then you are not certain.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"Do not humble yourself to a creature out of greed...

Seek sustenance from Allah, for His sustenance is between the Kaf and the Nun, meaning His saying \"Kun\" (Be) so it is.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"If there was in a deaf rock anchored... In the sea, gathered, smooth of sides.\nA sustenance for a servant created by Allah, it would split... Until it delivers to him all that is in it.\nOr if its path was under the layers of the seven (heavens)... Allah would facilitate the nearness of its ascents.\nUntil the one for whom in the Tablet is a share attains it... Either it comes to him or he comes to it.\"\nO son of Adam, do not worry about your tomorrow's sustenance, and act as if it is in your hand. If your sustenance were in a deaf rock, gathered, and joined to the bottom of the sea, it would split from it until it reaches you and is obtained by you. If it were in the seventh heaven, Allah would facilitate its descent to you, until you attain what was written for you in the Tablet, and exchange distress for spirit (relief). Either it comes to you or you come to it, and quickly or slowly you possess it.\n\nChapter\nEstrangement\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"As if I am entrusted with designating the lands... To know of them the place of length and width.\nIf I have a return one day, then it is worthy... Otherwise, some evil is lighter than some.\"\nI wrote, my master - may Allah perpetuate your glory - from some dwellings of transfer and places of estrangement. The lands have thrown me around, and homelands have rejected me, until as if I am entrusted with measuring the earth and knowing the longitude and latitude. Or as if I am the successor of Khidr in traversing land and sea. If my travels result in the deal of the winner and I return to the homeland with the spoil of the victorious, then praise be to Allah for the life of hopes and the goodness of conditions. If it be the other, then some evil is lighter than some, and there is no despair in estrangement of ease and lowering (of wing). Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"And if the dwellings change from their state... Then leave the dwellings and hasten the transfer.\nStaying is not a mandatory duty upon you... In a town that leaves the mighty humiliated.\"\nAnd the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n\"And the most beloved of the land's horizons to the youth... Is a land in which he attains the noble demand.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"A man in his town is lost... And the lion in his thicket is hungry.\nSo rise, you will see the world and meet wishes... And death, no repeller repels it.\"\nIf your country and homeland reject you, and your desire and wish become impossible, then in the earth there is a place to move, and upon Allah is reliance. I advise you, my master, to depart from a town that clothes the mighty in the robe of the humiliated. The most beloved horizons to the noble is a land by which they reach the desire. Of old it was said that a man in his town is lost, just as the lion in his thicket is hungry. So upon you is estrangement to see the world and attain wishes. Beware of fear of death, for it is not repelled in the homeland and urban area, nor in estrangement and travel. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Burqu'i\"\n\"In disturbance and in estrangement... Is the attainment of wishes and reaching the desire.\nIf the fire, its fire stick narrows with it... Its spaciousness is in separating from the fire stick.\nIf a sharp sword settles in its sheath...

And in which the knots of amulets were untied from me.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"Nearness of the House in poverty is better...

What has he done to himself?\nHe separated from his loved ones, so they did not benefit... From life after him, nor did he benefit.\"\nI wrote - may Allah prolong my master's survival - and when I remembered the homeland, tears choked me, and sighs overcame me. Yearning for a land whose soil raised me, whose air nourished me, whose breeze brought me up, and in which amulets were untied from me. And regretting a town in which was the greening of my mustache and the prime of my youth, and in which is the gathering of my peers, brothers, and loved ones. Residence in it with insolvency was dearer to me than settling in other than it with wealth. But the decree of Allah has no defense before it nor prevention, nor abstention from it nor caution. So O my mercy for the stranger afflicted with the distress of estrangement and the burning of separation, residing in the land far from his homeland, distant from his dwelling. O my sorrow for what he did to himself and cut of his intimacy, when he separated from his most special loved ones and sincerest brothers. Neither do they benefit from life after him and rest from pain at his distance, nor does he enjoy his life after them and distinguish between it and his death. It is not difficult for Allah to return his estrangement and facilitate his return to his loved ones.\n\nChapter\nGreyness (Old Age)\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Al-Sahib\"\n\"What is the matter with her, she has exposed me... At my greyness to harm?\nShe says 'Away' after... She used to say 'Welcome' (Habba-dha).\nI was the kohl of her eye... So I became in it like the mote.\"\nAnd the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n\"The songstresses fault my greyness... And who is for me to enjoy the faulted?\nMy passion for youth, even if it passed... Is praiseworthy, below my passion for greyness.\"\nMy letter, my master - may Allah prolong your survival - and the morning of greyness has shone for me after you, and I was robbed of what I wore of the fresh robe of youth. My slave girl denied me and hated me, turned away from me and abandoned me, exposed me to harm and shunned me. She began saying to me 'Away', 'Uff', and 'Tuff', after she used to say 'Welcome', 'Hello', 'Family', and 'Ease'. I was in her eye like kohl and slumber, so I became in it like insomnia and mote. Greyness is a sin with songstresses not forgiven, and a defect not covered. Would that this defect lasted for me and covered part of me and all of me, and did not separate between me and my term (death). My passion for the departing youth is below my passion for the descending greyness. Farewell.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Rumi\"\n\"I became an old man having mark and pomp... The whites (women) call me 'Uncle' sometimes and 'Father'.\nThat is a call of reverence and honoring... I wished I were compensated for it with a nickname.\"\nI have worn the cloak of greyness, and the pomp of old age has ascended me. If the songstresses call me 'Uncle', I am filled with grief. If they call me 'Father', I think they heaped abuse on me. That is from them a call of reverence, even if it is to me a call of impairment. My wish is if I were compensated for it with a nickname requiring nearness from them.\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"I was stripped of youth, and I was fresh... Just as the branch is stripped of leaves.\nI wept over youth with all my tears... So weeping nor wailing benefited.\nOh would that youth returns one day... So I inform it what greyness did.\"",

    "text": "You knew me, my master - may Allah perpetuate your glory - young of age, moist of branch. You see me now having been stripped of the pleasing youth as the branch is stripped of leaves. How much I grieved over it the fill of my chest, and wept for it the fill of my eye. So the staying grief did not benefit, nor did the flowing tear cure. How often I say: Oh would that youth returns one day to me, and stops by me even for an hour. So I renew a covenant with it, guide coolness to my liver, and complain to it of greyness and its bad effects and bitter fruits. However, attaining the days of our Master the Just King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah perpetuate his state - is a new youth and a happy life. In passing life in his presence, viewing fortunes by his countenance, and enjoying the wearing of his blessing which races blessings, reveals worries, and raises ambitions, is a compensation for youth and its freshness, and the time of boyhood and its bloom. May Allah make him, of all that is prayed and will be prayed for kings and glorious ones, taking the most complete shares and the fullest numbers. Amen, O Allah, Amen.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz\"\n\"O my blamer, Time has sufficed you my refutation... I took from the glances of the buxom soft girl.\nAnd it sent greyness into my head and its parting... With its white falcons upon my black crows.\"\nAnd the saying of Yahya ibn Ziyad al-Harithi:\n\"When I saw greyness, its whiteness settled... In the parting of my head, I said to greyness: Welcome.\nIf I thought that if I withheld my greeting... It would turn away from me, I would have desired it to turn away.\nBut when it settled hated, the soul tolerated... It one day; it was more removing for the hate.\"\nAnd the saying of Muslim ibn al-Walid:\n\"Greyness is hated, and hated is its leaving me... Wonder at a thing loved despite hatred.\nYouth passes and a successor may come for it... But greyness goes lost with a lost one.\"\nI see you, my master - may Allah support you - blaming me for the impulses of youths and the instigations of Satan. Time has sufficed you my refutation and blame, since my yesterday in licentiousness is not like my today. I have forgotten the winks of glances from sick eyes since greyness bridled me with its praiseworthy bridle, and sent its white falcons upon my black crows. When it laughed to me revealing the fangs of snakes, and I wept over the sweetness of life, I said: Welcome to you as a comer whose stay I will honor, and hello to you as a visitor whose entertainment I will improve. Had I thought that if I withheld my greeting from its appearance I would find safety from its assault, I would not have greeted one who robs me of my intimacy, nor honored one who announces my death to my soul. But when the intended hateful thing and the pain of the observing matter settle, if a man's soul tolerates what it meets of evil and endures of bitter life, that is more repelling to its harm and more removing for its shame. It is known that greyness is hated in visiting and embracing, hated in going and separating. So despite hatred of it, it is loved, and despite its bad effect, it is not cursed. That is because youth passes and greyness succeeds it, while greyness is followed only by near death. May Allah help us in preparation for the Day of Return.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Let not greyness frighten you, O daughter of Abdullah... For greyness is ornament and dignity.\nGardens are only beautiful when... Flowers laugh in their midst.\"\nAnd the saying of Di'bil:\n\"Welcome and hello to greyness, for it is... The mark of the chaste and the awe of the pious.\nMy greyness was like a string of shining pearls... In the crown of a glorious, crowned king.\"\nAnd the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n\"And the whiteness of the falcon is truer in beauty... If you contemplate, than the blackness of the crow.\"\nMy letter, my master - may Allah perpetuate your glory - and greyness has descended upon my hair and extended its embroidery on my face. Flowers laughed in the garden, tar whitened, and dignity loomed. So welcome and hello to greyness, and welcome to the beloved enemy. For it is the mark of the chaste pious, and the awe of the noble scrupulous. In it you witness experience and the title of trial and wisdom. As if it is the ornament of a king or a string of pearls in the crown of a king. The camphor of greyness is more splendid than the musk of youth, and the whiteness of the falcon is more beautiful than the blackness of the crow. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Rumi\"\n\"O man who blackens his hair... So that he is counted thereby among youths, desist.\nEven if you blackened every white... Pigeon, you would not be counted among crows.\"\nDyeing - may Allah support you - is of false witnesses and goods of deception. I see you in severe trouble and arduous effort from overcoming Time by blackening hair. So gently, may Allah have mercy on you. Know that old men are not counted among youths. Even if you blackened white pigeons, you would not be counted among crows. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of some long-lived Arabs\"\n\"The benders of Time bent me until...

He has descended from Highness to the highest station behind which there is no aim for eyes, and above which there is no field for thoughts. He entrusted Time with his high ambition and his guarding eye. He heals all that it wounded and revives all that it slaughtered. Until his beauties made forgotten the evils of all time, and his virtues encompassed every human. If you settle in his presence, you settle in the spacious quarter and the fertile courtyard, which is the suckling of clouds and remover of worries, the mine of generosity, the spring of blessings, the refuge of creation, and the divider of sustenance. If you see there, you see bliss and a great kingdom, an illuminating moon, and a raining cloud. If he hears free speech in the service of his high qualities and praise of his endeavors, the shake of Glory and the relief of pure Generosity take him. As if Ishaq al-Mawsili is singing to him, and the strings are responding, and the cups are alternating. Were it not for the grace of Allah and the wonders of His making and the marvels of His power, those virtues would not have grown in flesh, nor those noble deeds mixed with blood. So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators. May Allah keep our Master for the world and religion. By Allah, he was not fair who described his flooding generosity and compared it to the raining cloud, because it gives while it is frowning of face, weeping of eye, while our Master - may Allah guard his kingdom - gives while he is apparent of cheer, laughing of tooth. May noble deeds never cease to issue from his characteristics, and successes be watched from his lightnings.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Al-Buhturi\"\n\"You drew near in humility and rose in glory...

In his generosity and nobility and good characteristics, he is like the rain quenching the thirsty and reviving the livelihood. If he surpassed those in the horizons while he is of them, and excelled all of them while he is part of them, then musk is some of the gazelle's blood, and emerald is some of the stones of mountains.

What is in them of beauties and what creation has by them of blessings cannot be counted. As for the full moon of the sky, it is the one Allah illuminated and raised. As for the full moon of the earth, it is Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun Khwarazm Shah. He is the King who fills eyes with beauty and hearts with perfection. In his hand are the keys of provisions and terms.

    "text": "\"Tigris gives drink, and Abu Ghanim... Feeds whoever Tigris gives drink to among people.\nPeople are a body, and the Imam of Guidance... Is a head, and you are the eye in the head.\"\nTo Allah belong honored servants; Ma'mun feeds them and Jayhun gives them drink. What a difference between giving drink and feeding, and between livestock (An'am) and favoring (In'am). People are a body whose head is the Commander of the Faithful and the Imam of Muslims. Our Master the King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah strengthen his victory - is the eye of the head, the point of people, and the spring of dew and might. May Allah keep him as long as souls draw from breaths.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Mutanabbi\"\n\"Allah has honored a land you are its inhabitant... And honored people since He made you a human.\"\nAnd the saying of Abu al-Fath Kushajim:\n\"Mankind stared at your perfection, so seek refuge... From their evil eyes with a single fault.\"\nAllah has honored the earth and made it one of the best regions and most auspicious spots since our Master the King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah perpetuate his kingdom - inhabited it. He is a scholar in the garb of a world, and a king in the form of an angel. Just as He honored people by creating him a human. He is beauty in its entirety, and perfection in its totality. There is no fault in him other than that 'no fault in him' turns the eye (evil eye) away from his high qualities. Would that he had a single fault to protect his glory and extended beauties with. Even if he does not protect them with a fault, the Knower of the Unseen will protect him from the accidents of time and its calamities, and guard him from its misfortunes and thunderbolts. And He will place upon his soul, his blessing, his kingdom, and his dear ones a lasting protection by His mercy.\n\nChapter\nSatire\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Al-Hutay'ah\"\n\"Leave noble deeds, do not travel to seek them... And sit, for you are, by my life, the fed, the clothed.\"\nAnd the saying of Al-A'sha, and they are among the most satirical poetry of the Arabs:\n\"You spend the night in winter full of your bellies... While your female neighbors are hungry, spending the night empty-bellied.\"\nLeave noble deeds to their masters, and abandon them to their owners. Do not move your foot towards them, nor tighten your saddle to them. Move away from noble deeds, which are to you among debts, rather among prohibitions. And sit at the place of rebuke of weary dogs, and in the row of sandals. You are only for comforting the body, sweetening the food, improving the dress, and refining horses. You are the one who guards his money while honor is lost, and fills his belly while the neighbor is hungry. Suffice that as meanness and blameworthy character.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Muslim ibn al-Walid\"\n\"Their appearances were ugly, so when I tested them... Their appearances became beautiful due to the ugliness of the substance.\"\nAnd his saying, which we present from the eyes of the poetry of the moderns counted in satire:\n\"As for satire, your honor is too small for it... And praise regarding you, as you knew, is great.\nSo go, for you are released by your honor; indeed it is... An honor you were mighty by, while you are humiliated.\"\nI have been afflicted with people, fed ones, mean ones. You find their appearances ugly as long as you do not know their substances. When you test them, you find their ugly appearances beautiful due to the ugliness of their blameworthy substances. There is none of them but his honor is too small for satire and defamation, just as saying praise and eulogy is too great for him. He is in the custody of his vileness and baseness, and the contempt of his meanness and vice. He is released by his honor, malicious in his vehicle, mean in his lineage. Indeed, he was mighty by it while he is more humiliated than a nail clipping in garbage, and less than straw in mud brick.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Umara al-Suri, and it is the most eloquent said in its meaning\"\n\"A heavy one Allah created, the heaviest of what is seen... In every heart is a hidden hatred of him.\nHe walked, so the whale called its Lord from his heaviness... And said: My God, the earth increased an eighth.\"\nNo welcome to the heaviest of the two weights (Jinn and Mankind), and the most hated of the people of the two horizons. One who has in the heart of everyone on earth an abundant, full share of hatred. When he walked, the whale felt pain from his heaviness and complained of him to its Lord, and said: O You who encompassed creation with justice and grace, You created an eighth earth by which You increased me in heaviness. Allah will relieve the whale from the heaviness of his stillness and movement, and the rest of creation from the abundance of his bad luck and lack of his blessing, by His grace and mercy.\n\nChapter\nThe Gift\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Ahmad ibn Yusuf the Scribe to Al-Ma'mun\"\n\"Upon the servant is a right, so he must be its doer... Even if the Master is great and his favors are majestic.\nDid you not see us gifting to Allah His property... Even if He is Rich from it, He is its accepter.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"If I were to gift according to the measure of your virtue... Then I would have gifted you the world and what is in it.\"",

    "text": "Upon the servant - may Allah prolong the survival of our Master the King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - is a right he must fulfill, and serve with what he gifts, even if the Master is great and his high qualities are majestic. Therefore, we gift to Allah His property which is from His gifts, so He accepts it from His servants despite His richness. If I were to gift to his treasury - may Allah populate it with the length of his life - according to the height of his destiny and the loftiness of his status and command, I would have gifted the world in the exhibition of its greenness and freshness, and Paradise in the robes of its splendor and bloom. But I stopped at my capacity in service with a little that the sincerity of my thanks makes much, and a small amount that the clarity of my excuse makes big. If he sees - may Allah elevate his opinion - to show favor to his servant by permission to present that to him, honoring him and increasing in kindness to him, he will do so, God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Matran\"\n\"Affections, if devoid... Of mutual gifting, are muddied.\nLike a stew devoid of... Meat, called Muzawwarah (Falsified/Vegetarian).\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"There is no friend, even if his friendship is complete... One day, more successful in needs than a dish (gift).\nIf he covers himself with the napkin setting out... He does not fear the repulsion of a doorman or a lock.\nDo not lie, for people since they were created... For desire they honor people or fear.\nIndeed deeds are above the star in their demand... And speech is found thrown on the roads.\"\nBrotherhood is by mutual gifting, and alliance by mutual kindness. Affection without a gift is muddied, just as broth without meat is Muzawwarah. Nothing is more reforming for two friends and more gathering for the reunion of love between two brothers than a dish of kindness and gentleness, containing masterpieces and novelties. If its carrier covers it with a napkin, he does not fear the difficulty of the heavy barrier. It is known that most people give out of desire or fear, and the fewest of them is he who gives out of mercy and reckoning (reward from Allah). Deeds have always been difficult to desire, rare to attain and establish, found on every road and with every enemy and friend. What a difference between sound dirhams and speech that goes in the winds.\n\n\"A Note on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"My gift is a ring to a man of letters... Reminding him of the covenant of his servant's affection.\nIf a pupil were engraved with its look... I would have made the eye the stone of his ring.\"\nWith this note of mine - may Allah prolong my master - is a ring gifted by a servant. He showed kindness with it to his gathering, to remind him when he wears it. He wishes he could mount in it the gem of his chest and engrave it with the pupil of his eye, so he would not be devoid of seeing him in the state of his presence and absence. My master is higher of eye in what he sees of accepting it and signing to me with the mention of its arrival. God willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"We have sent to you - may Allah support us - ... A kindness, so be accepting of it.\nDo not compare it to the dew of your flooding palm... And your abundant, copious kindness.\nAnd forgive the smallness of the gift from me... Indeed the effort of the poor is not little.\"\nI sent to you, O my master and lord - may Allah prolong your survival - something that slips from thought and is less than mention. So I love that you accept it despite its smallness, and do not compare it to what you give despite its abundance. And know that it is the effort of the poor, not the choice of the independent, and the masterpiece of the frugal courteous one, not the gift of the accumulating wealthy one. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu al-Atahiya\"\n\"A sandal I sent for you to wear... A foot with which you strive to glory.\nIf it were proper that I share with it... A cheek, I would have made my cheek its strap.\"\nI sent to my master - may Allah perpetuate his support - a sandal with which he strives to every noble station, general glory, and great honor. Even if I cut it from my skin and strapped it with my cheek, I would not reach what is in the intention of servitude. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Mansur al-Faqih\"\n\"I gifted something that would be little were it not for... The story of omen and blessing.\nA chair (Kursi) I took as a good omen in it when... I saw its reverse pleases you.\"\nAnd the saying of Abu Bakr al-Khawarizmi:\n\"I ransom you; I did not send the cup (Kub) except... For an omen in it, a beginning, a return.\nIf you reverse Kub, it is Kawn (Being/Universe)... So be a universe that lasts without corruption.\"\nThe masters of men have spoken regarding Omen, because it is the tongue of time, and in it is the joy of man. With this note of mine, O my master - may Allah perpetuate your glory - is a chair (Kursi) I intended for omen and blessing, when I saw its reverse pleases you: 'Kub' (Cup), its reverse is 'Buk' (?). 'Kursi', its reverse is 'Yusrk' (Pleases you). So be a universe without corruption, and a sale without stagnation. And remain for accepting the little and giving the much, as long as eternity is known and nights and days connect.\n\nChapter\nCongratulations\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Ibrahim ibn al-Abbas\"\n\"We do not congratulate you on Tus... But we congratulate Tus on you.\nFor Tus has become today... By you, a bride.\"",

So the traces of his competence improve in it, and the ray of his happiness extends over it. I ask Allah to couple good and choice with what He entrusted him, and grant him success to attain His pleasure in what He gave him, and make him know of the happiness of his work what leads to the realization of his hope.

And its night-traveler saw the direction in the darkness.\"\nI praise Allah Almighty for the blessing that encompassed the people of the earth, and singled out those of pure virtue. Since the Vizierate was arranged from our Master the Vizier - may Allah prolong his survival - with its equal and sufficient one. The bow was handled by its shaper, and affairs ran their best courses. So the world is congratulated by what extended over it of his deed, and the earth shines with the light of his justice and virtue. May Allah choose good in what he took charge of and assumed, surround him with protection and support him, and couple success with him and not isolate him.

With happiness, they did not set nor rise.\nThe curtains did not hide the like of them... Among whom we saw and whom was heard of.\nMay joy last for him with her and for her... And may they be congratulated throughout life together.\"\nWelcome to the gathering of the sun and the moon, the meeting of hearing and sight, the connection of the free man with the free woman, and the conjunction of Jupiter with Venus. The seers have not seen the gathering of their likes in a curtain, nor have the narrators narrated the meeting of their forms in a chamber. May Allah perpetuate their joy with each other, congratulate them throughout life in ease and lowering (of wing), and make the connection between them connected with the most growing numbers, the purest children, the most perfect talents, and the most praiseworthy consequences. Amen.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Rumi congratulating on a Newborn\"\n\"A full moon and a sun gave birth to a star... I swore by Allah they have produced a noble one.\nBlessed is Allah and Glory be to Him... What a meteor from them is most piercing!\nThree whose lights shine... No east was exchanged for a west.\"\nGlad tidings! For the result of honor and glory has appeared, and the moon and the sun gave birth to a star of happiness. So Glory be to Allah! What piercing meteor was generated from them in the sphere of happiness, and what shining light sparkled by them in the horizon of nobility? They are three whose lights shine, and whose news are good. May no wests be exchanged for their easts. May Allah perpetuate the gifts for them, bless the parents and the child, make known in him the happiness of the birth and the blessing of the resource, and show from his sons righteous children and serving grandsons. Amen.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Tammam in Congratulating on the Arrival from Hajj\"\n\"As for that you performed Hajj, it is accepted and righteous... The share is abundant from you, the sin is forgiven.\nYou performed of the Hajj of Islam its obligation... Then returned, and the effort from you is thanked.\"\nThanks, thanks, O my master - may Allah prolong your survival. You have intended the most noble destinations, witnessed the most honorable scenes, visited the Ancient Glorified House, and served the Corner, the Hatim, and Zamzam. You arrived at the watering places of Paradise, and camped at the dwellings of Mercy. You performed the loan and fulfilled the obligation. You returned to your family happy, abundant. May Allah make your Hajj righteous (Mabrur), your effort thanked, your scales heavy, your trade profitable, and blessings coming and going to you.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu al-Fath to his son Abu al-Fadl Ibn al-Amid congratulating him on Nayrouz\"\n\"Be happy with a Nayrouz that came to you announcing... Happiness, increase, and permanence.\nSo drink, for the spring has uncovered its veil... Revealing a cheerful, smiling view.\"\nMay Allah make our Master the Supported King Khwarazm Shah happy with this new season and praiseworthy Nayrouz. Which visited him announcing the most complete happiness, the best habit, and the most perfect increase. And inviting to drink upon the face of the fertile spring, for it has uncovered its veil revealing the beautiful wondrous view. Our Master - may Allah prolong his survival and perpetuate his kingdom - is higher of eye in what he sees of accepting the invitation, fulfilling the right of intimacy in it, striking the fire of joy in cups, and asking rain from the cloud of amusement with wine. May he never cease to be hitting with the arrow of hope, abundant in the wing of joy, observing life green of wood, wearing time continuous of fortunes, drawing lots for the virgin pleasures as he draws lots for the virgin lands, and picking the fruits of livelihood and the Hereafter. And may Allah perpetuate his authority as long as times repeat and Nayrouz and Mehregan alternate.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn Abi al-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi congratulating Sayf al-Dawla on Eid\"",

Due to what ran of Allah's decree with happiness whose lights shone, and misfortune whose traces were bad. So it encompassed all people with desolation and intimacy, and made them weep and laugh between funerals and weddings. It obliged each of them to raise hands to Allah asking for patience upon the great calamity and the massive loss in the past Prince - may Allah be pleased with him and please him, and make Paradise his abode. And obligated them to bear thanks for the general gift and the noble blessing in our Master the Prince, the Master - may Allah perpetuate his support - the inheritor of the throne of his authority, established in his high place. Praise be to Allah who, when He took back the most noble loan, delivered the best wishes. When He tested with the greatest horrors, He favored with the most noble hopes.

And the vicissitude of Time said: Where are the men?\nThis is Abu al-Qasim in his coffin... Arise, look how mountains vanish.\nO supporter of the kingdom with his opinions... After you, for the kingdom, are long nights.\"\nAnd his saying:\n\"Did you not see the death of highness and praiseworthy deeds... And how we buried creation in one grave?\nTime has days that abuse intentionally... And do good, if they do good, unintentionally.\"\nAnd the saying of Mansur al-Faqih:\n\"I say when their saying crushed me... Ibn Aqil passed to his Lord.\nBecause he resembled people most in his death... Indeed he lived a time without a resemble.\"\nI wrote - may Allah prolong your survival, O my master - while the matter has become grave, the calamity great, the announcer came, efforts were mourned, people became equal, perfection died, terms ruled, and Time said: Where are the men? So-and-so rode the coffin after the throne, and mounted necks after horses. Look how impregnable mountains collapse and high mountains vanish. Oh my sorrow if sorrow availed, and oh my regret if regret was useful, upon the supporter of the kingdom with his opinions that hide their plots and show their benefits, and plans whose beginnings succeed and whose consequences delight. How eclipsed is the mind of Glory since it swallowed his loss, and how long are the nights of the kingdom after him! Highness and praiseworthy deeds died with his death, and virtues and institutes ended. Glory wore for him the clothes of a bereaved griever. Creation was buried in one grave. Time has days that do good inadvertently and do evil intentionally, and give in jest and take back in earnest. How often I said when so-and-so moved to the neighborhood of his Lord and turned to His honor and pardon: Because he resembled people most in his death, indeed he was without a resemble throughout his life. May Allah have mercy on his falling place, cool his lying place, honor his return, and make the abode of the righteous his place. And may He grant you success for what fortifies reward and does not nullify it, and provides recompense and does not drop it. And may He prolong your period after him, and make thanks in blessing your material, and patience upon tribulation your equipment.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Tammam, and it is the blaze (best) of his elegies\"\n\"Lo, indeed in death's gaining of a soul... The eye of noble deeds remains weeping for it.\nIt is the soul; if noble deeds weep for its loss... It is pulled from between the vitals of noble deeds.\"\nAnd the saying of Abu al-Atahiya:\n\"Be patient for every calamity and endure...

How can I not be so when I see between the sharp claws of death and its strong fangs a noble form being preyed upon, and a generous soul being snatched? The eye of highness weeps, the heart of glory panics, and the soul of virtue is terrified. No wonder that Generosity weeps for it the fill of its eye, and grieves for it the fill of its heart. From its vitals it was pulled, and from its liver it was cut. What is the trick when the inevitable decree has settled, and the obligatory condolence has become due? Accidents are more than the plants of the earth and the drops of the sky. Who is he who has not been afflicted with the great loss? You are not, my master, unique in this path. Among what eases the severity of calamities and lightens the weight of misfortunes is remembering the calamity in the Master of Worlds and Seal of Prophets, Muhammad, blessings of Allah and His peace be upon him and upon his family and companions all. In him is solace, and for us in him is a model. May Allah pour upon you endurance matching the gathering of your opinion and intellect, and patience preserving for you the stores of your forbearance. And may He fulfill for so-and-so the portions of His forgiveness, and dwell him in His spacious gardens. Your opinion, master - may Allah prolong your survival - in writing to me with what you were guided to of the resolve of patience and determination of endurance, so I follow you in them and quote their lights from you, is thanked.

That among the honors of a youth is his sending forward the harem (women/daughters)?\nO gloater over Banu Wahb when they were bereaved... Do not rejoice at a decrease that increased them in honor.\"\nDo not grieve, my master, may you be protected from grief and pain. And may you not lack a survival accompanying blessings. Know that burying daughters is among the honors, covering private parts is among the good deeds, and sending forward the harem is among the blessings. Let it reach the gloater over Banu So-and-so what I say, and acceptance is not upon me: Do not rejoice at a decrease that increased them in honor and benefited them in blessings. They have been alerted with an admonition, provided with a reward, covered a private part, and sufficed a burden. Farewell.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Muslim ibn al-Walid, and it is the most elegiac verse of the moderns\"\n\"They wanted to hide his grave from his enemy... So the goodness of the grave's soil indicated the grave.\"\nThe gardens whose sides were thin and whose embroiderer was elegant envied a land in which so-and-so was buried. When fear hid his grave from the enemy in the earth, the breeze of pure generosity indicated it. The scent of fresh glory wafted from it, and its soil substituted in goodness for the breaths of the beloved.\n\nChapter\nVisiting\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"If you wish to be hated, visit continuously... And if you wish to increase in love, visit intermittently.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"Stick to lessening the visit, for it... If it increases, it is a path to abandonment.\nFor I saw the rain tired of when constant... And asked for with hands when it withheld.\"\nVisiting is an increase in friendship, its scarcity is safety from boredom, and its excess is a cause of severance. Everything excessive is the enemy of nature. How excellent is what the Owner of the Sharia, peace be upon him, said: \"Visit intermittently, you will increase in love.\" Rain, if it does not increase, is Ghayth (relief/rain). If it lasts and continues, it is Ghaith (vomit? likely intended: bothersome). No wonder it is tired of if it lasts, even if it revives plants and livestock. And it is asked for with hands and supplication if the knot of the sky is not untied by it.\n\n\"A Note on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"I saw you loving me... And at the time I am absent, yearning.\nSo I abandoned not for boredom... Occurring, nor did I create a blame.\nExcept for the saying of our Prophet... Visit over the days intermittently.\nSo I abandoned when I abandoned so that... I increase by intermittence in nearness.\nSo excuse Abu Hasan and do not... Make my sitting away from you a sin.\nAllah knows that I am... To you, of the two weights (Jinn and Mankind), the most sincere in heart.\"\nI see you, O my master and lord - may Allah prolong your survival - loving me, yearning for me, reading the page of affection from my heart. So I sit back from you at some times without boredom or blame calling for disturbance. But to take the Sunnah of intermittence in visiting loved ones. I abandon you, O my master, out of desire for your connection, and distance myself from you out of eagerness for your nearness. I am patient from continuing with you out of stinginess from me for your sincerity. I hope you accept my excuse in apologizing, and turn my affair to the beautiful. Do not count as a sin my intermittence in visiting and my mediating between the two ends of severance and perseverance. By Allah, neither the dusty (earth) carries nor the green (sky) shades one more sincere than me in heart in loyalty to you, and purer in conscience in comforting you. May Allah prolong your period and guard your affection.",

Farewell.\n\nChapter\nVisiting the Sick\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Ahmad ibn Yusuf\"\n\"They said Abu al-Fadl is ill, so I said to them... May my soul be his ransom from every caution.\nWould that his illness were with me, and that he has... The reward of the sick while I am unrewarded.\"\nAnd the saying of Abu Tammam:\n\"No life unless illness avoids your body... So distress clears by you from your brothers.\nMay you rise (La'a), Abu Ja'far, and be safe, for indeed saved... By you are chivalry and by you nobility rose high.\nWe were ignorant so we thought you fell ill, but no... By Allah, nothing fell ill but Wit and Literature.\"\nIt knocked on my hearing - may Allah prolong my master's survival - the news of his complaint, may Allah couple it with his recovery. So a fright overtook me, and anguish possessed me. I ransomed him from the cautioned with the two dear ones: family and child. Rather, with the two pillars: heart and liver. Rather, with my entire self and my whole soul. I wished I bore the illness and its pains on his behalf, and he attained its reward and recompense. I swear I have no life unless recovery shakes hands and rising and independence approach. So clouds clear from his brothers, and wellness circulates with the beloved to his friends. I ask Allah Almighty with sincere intention and pure belief to lift his side from it, erase his sin by it, save him as chivalry and virtues were saved by him, and perpetuate his highness as the piercing lineage rose high by him.\n\n\"Another on Untying his Saying also\"\n\"Abu al-Qasim the Praised (Al-Mahmud) if praise is mentioned... You were protected from calamities whatever goes and comes.\nIf edges of a fever have reached you... No wonder that the rosy lion is fevered.\nOurs, not yours, is the complaint, and it is not harmful... If the blade of the sword is healthy, what the sheath encountered.\"\nMay Allah keep you and protect you, heal you and suffice you and grant you wellness. If you complained, my master, of an illness, and became a target for fever, no wonder that the rosy lion is fevered, and the moon eclipses the full moon. Ours, not yours, is what you endure of pains. And in the sheath, not in the sword, is the blade. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Rumi\"\n\"For you did not fall ill, rather High Ranks... And you did not sicken, rather Hearts.\"\nAnd the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz:\n\"O Time, the Vizier falls ill... And I do not approach his door.\nThis is of the misery which... I ceased not to be of its companions.\nO Lord, keep death away from him... And wash him from his pains.\nWho is like him? None is like him... In the worlds, nor with him.\"\nOur Master - may Allah prolong his survival - did not fall ill, but the soul of Highness and the hearts of allies. How often I said when the news reached me of what happened to him of illness, and what pain he has of pain: O Time, does our Master - may Allah support him - fall ill so you hinder me from visiting him, until I do not approach his courtyard? This is nothing but misery which accompanies him forever. Then I said: O Lord, wash him from his pains with the water of healing, and enrich him with safety from medicine and doctors. For who is like him while Glory and Generosity are within his clothes, and with all people is his likeness?\n\nChapter\nSatire\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\n\"The blessing of Allah is not faulted, but... It may be deemed ugly upon some people.\nRichness does not befit the face of Abu Ya'la... Nor the light of the splendor of Islam.\nDirty of robe, turban, and palfrey... And face, nape, and boy.\"",

    "text": "The blessing of Allah, its risings are not faulted, but its locations may be deemed ugly with people who are the order of defects and ugliness, and the gathering of disgraces and scandals. It is to me like the noble free woman married by a mean slave, and like the luxurious necklace worn by a ugly monkey. By Allah, richness does not befit the face of Abu Ya'la, nor does the light of Islam shine upon it. Do you not see him, chronically ill of chivalry, dirty of clothes, disheveled of mount and boy? He is more similar to the poor than to the rich. May Allah not distance other than him, and suffice us his meeting.\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"If you are a possessor of money and are not preferring (generous)... Then you have no virtue over the dog and the monkey.\nTo a saying: My fathers built glory and highness... You spoke truth, but you have shat on glory.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"You boasted of your origin, a noble origin... Strike with it your obscure self.\nAnd what does the origin from Hashim benefit... If the soul is from Bahila?\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"O most generous of people in fathers and boasting... And meanest of people when tested and tried.\nMen lower their eyes if his fathers are mentioned... To him, and lower their eyes if his deed is mentioned.\"\nIf you are supported by money like the number of men and above hopes, and did not walk with it the paths of benevolence and favoring, and were turning away from the beautiful and closing eyes to the good, then what virtue do you have over the vile dog and the base monkey? If you boasted of your noble fathers who built glory and highness over the days, we said: You spoke truth. But they built and you demolished, they were generous and you were not, they were righteous and you were not. Rather, you shat on glory. You are a shame among blazes, and a pebble among pearls. What does the noble origin benefit the silly branch, and the Hashimite lineage and the Bahilite soul? What good is the most generous of people boasting, and the meanest of them when tested? If his fathers, who are the most glorious ancestors and best nobles, are mentioned, men lower their eyes to them out of magnification, greatness, reverence, and respect. If he is mentioned, he lowers his eyes out of shame from his bad news, and looks down out of embarrassment from his malicious trace. May Allah protect us from the positions of ugliness and gatherings of cursing, and cover us with His beautiful cover, and shade us with His shading shadow.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Your father is a free father and your mother is a free woman... And two free ones may birth a non-noble.\nSo let not people wonder at you and at them... For dross from silver is not wonderful.\"\nYour father is free and your mother is free. There is nothing in them but a blaze (nobility). But you are between them a shame. Two noble ones may birth a non-noble. Dross from silver is not wonderful, nor are thorns in the palm tree strange, nor smoke from fire odd.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of the Professor Abu Bakr al-Khawarizmi regarding Raja' and Al-Abbas, sons of Al-Walid al-Isbahani\"\n\"And when I saw the two sons of Walid... And between them a difference in deeds.\nI gifted the ugliness of this one to the beauty of that one... And advanced the consequences and nights.\nIt is the hand; the right of it did good... So we permitted for it the sin of the left.\"\nWhen I saw the two brothers, So-and-so and So-and-so, and between them a far distance in qualities and severe difference in deeds. So-and-so has in every noble deed the blaze of white horses and the primary feather of the wing. And So-and-so protects his penny and degrades his soul. I gifted the ugliness of this one famous for disgraces to the beauty of that one mentioned for high qualities. I ran on my habit in advancing consequences and nights. They are in representation nothing but the two hands; the right of them did good, all good. So we permitted the sin of the left by the permission of Allah the Manan.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu al-Fath al-Busti\"\n\"I said when you became a chest (leader) and the groups... Of people became delegates to you.\nMay Allah not tend to the one who tended to you and raised... Above the hands of the sons of highness your hands.\nFor indeed, he is humiliated who granted you glory... And indeed, he slipped who slipped towards you.\"\nI saw you as a chest issuing your opinion, and people crowding at your courtyard. I did not possess except the supplication issuing from a constricted chest and a snowy heart. I said: May Allah not tend to the one who tended to you, until your hands rose above those of highness. For indeed, he is humiliated who extended the tent of glory over you, and slipped, by Allah, who slipped towards you.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Mansur ibn Badhan\"\n\"Abu Dulaf, poverty to me is not in its essence... Except a man hoping for your dew and expecting it.\nAs if you are a drum, wonderful of voice, hollow... Empty of goods, desolate are its entrances.\nAnd more amazing than what is in you is the handing over of command... To you in mockery, and that you are accepting it.\"\nAbu Dulaf, the poor is none but the one hoping for your dew. And the disappointed in his right and truth is none but the one seeking shade in your shelter. You are nothing but the drum; its voice frightens while it is empty of returns, and its fame pleases while it is zero of benefits. Of wonder is people handing over command to you in mockery, and your accepting it metaphorically and as a nickname.",

And erased the traces of wit and literature.\nAnd came with scribes, if my hand extended... In them, I would have returned them to the Kuttab (School).\nAnd I see Ibn Jumhur has become boasting... Imitating the great scribes.\nBut he tears a thousand scrolls when... He is asked for an answer to a letter.\"\nAnd the saying of Abu al-Fath Kushajim:\n\"Did you claim that in writing you are overtaking... My striving, and said: Our weapons are pens?\nFar from it! That is a mixed craft... In it is clear light and darkness.\nThis iron is the weapon of the heroes of war... And with it the cupper spills our blood.\"\nPerish and relapse for Time, for it has come to us with wonder, erased the traces of literature, and came with scribes who rightly should be returned to the Kuttab. Among them is So-and-so, fraudulently inserting himself among the great scribes and their likes, imitating their leaders and virtuous ones. He is the stupid one who tears scrolls and exhausts bundles when ordered to answer a letter, then does not come up with correctness in it. The matter is that he claims to rival me, and alleges that he is overtaking my striving in matching me. He says: Our craft is one, which is speech, and our weapon is one, which is pens. He does not know that the craft of writing varies in degrees, differs in classes. In it is sunny morning and pitch-black darkness. And this iron is the weapon of heroes whom refrainment does not afflict, and with it the cupper extracts our blood. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn Zurayq al-Kufi regarding Al-Suli's Poetry\"\n\"My house is without Khaysh (coarse linen for cooling), but I... If I wished, the Khaysh would be two layers.\nA house, if its heat pains me... I recited two verses of Al-Suli.\"\nThe authority of heat has strengthened, and the carpet of embers has been spread for it. The mid-day heats borrowed their fire from the heart of the abandoned, until they exceeded the heated oven. When I became weary with it of life, and the trick in ice and Khaysh failed me, I intended Al-Suli's poetry and recited two verses from it, and repeated it twice. So I find the mask of heat has been uncovered, and its harm has been restricted. I see the scorpions of cold creeping to me, and its storms blowing on me. So wonder at poetry that returns summer as autumn, nay dense winter. Oh what a beneficial medicine for severe heat, if only it didn't bring us the prepared severe cold (Zamharir).\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu al-Fath Kushajim, and it is the most eloquent said in satirizing the singer and wittiest\"\n\"And a singer, cold of tone... Impaired of hands.\nHis nearness cuts pleasures more... Than the shout of separation.\nNo one saw him in... The house of a people twice.\"\nWe have been afflicted with one who sings, so he distresses. And plays, so he does not delight. Rather, he necessitates hitting him after cursing him. His nearness imitates the shout of separation between lovers. He is not free of defect and stumbling, and is not seen twice in a house.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"The heavens weep when he calls... And the earth seeks help from his prostration.\nIf he desires one day the meat of sandgrouse... He strikes them down in the air with his breath.\"\nAnd the saying of the other:\n\"He spent the evening talking to me, so I said to my companion... Is he talking or breaking wind from his mouth?\nOh woe to basil, his weeping is by him... And woe to the cup that gives him drink.\"\nWe seek refuge in Allah from the breaths of So-and-so, for they take away breaths and fly the souls of sitters. If he calls, the sky weeps from his greasy, dirty call. If he prostrates, the earth seeks help from his prostration breathing of excrement. If he desires the meat of birds while they are in the air, almost hitting the clouds of the sky, it is only that he sends up to them that deadly breath, and sets upon them those malicious breaths, until he strikes them down around him in twos and ones, and hunts them - may Allah make him ugly - a hunter. Among his characteristics is that it is not known if he broke wind or breathed, and passed gas or spoke. So oh woe to the drink that becomes from his drinking, and oh woe to the basil that greets him. Oh what a man, the entrance of his eating is more malicious than the exit of his waste.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other regarding the Length of the Beard\"\n\"And a beard four by four... Long, wide, square.\nHe weaves from it every day a shirt... And stuffs from its edges a pack-saddle.\"\nAnd the saying of Al-Najim:\n\"And a beard carried by a fool...

    "text": "If the beard grows long, the mind becomes sparse (Kawsaj). If it increases, virtue decreases. I see for So-and-so a beard among the wonders of the earth, extreme in length and width. Every corner of it is a cubit by a cubit, and every wing is a sail with a sail. If it were of goods, it would be of sacks. Or of sins, it would be of major sins. If shaved, shirts would be woven from it. If plucked, pack-saddles would be stuffed with it. If he dove with it in the sea, he would catch its whales. If he traversed the desert with it, its ghouls would be frightened.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other regarding the Size of the Nose\"\n\"I was in a banquet of a people who sent... A messenger towards Musa the Crusher (Al-Hutamah).\nSo his nose came to us before forenoon... And Musa came long after darkness.\"\nA wonder, not hidden from you. Which is that I was in a banquet attended by noble guests and witty youths. They suggested So-and-so to marvel at his huge nose and massive heaviness. When the messenger was sent to him - and the story is long - his nose came to us uprooting, while the day had matured and risen. He came while the night had cast its cloak upon us and dressed us in its fur. So seeing exceeded hearing, and we witnessed one of the lessons. We spent the night drinking and being merry and delighted, and marveling at that obscene nose.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Bakr al-Badisha'i regarding a Parasite (Tufayli)\"\n\"O ant of ghee in parasitism, no... Trick blocks its approaches.\nHe smells the scent of roasting from a march of two months... So in an hour he arrives at it.\nIf we protect ourselves from you with the wall... And with doors and the lock, you do not care about them.\nAnd if we swat you like a fly from the... Dish so you do not taste what is in it.\nYou fall into it risking, so it is either... Eating or death in its sides.\nWe plant the vineyard for wine, so you see... Counting its days and numbering them.\nYear by year, so when it is clarified or... The clay is removed from its jars.\nYou came gently so you are its drinker... Before its clarifyer and its cupbearer.\"\nO more parasitic than an ant on ghee, and than the fly on dates. I see you smelling the scents of cooking and roasting from a march of two months, so you arrive at them in less than two hours. Walls and doors do not repel you from them, nor do locks and veils benefit us with you. If we chased you like dogs and swatted you like flies, you fell into the dishes and were not deterred from them by sticks. You risked yourself, so either frantic eating or malicious death. The vineyard is planted in its time and supported by its sticks. You cease not to count its days and number its years, until it ripens and is trellised so it holds fast, and bears the mothers of nectar in stores of crystal and carnelian. When it is picked and stacked, and presses are taken for it and it is pressed, and deposited in the bellies of jars, and given respite for a time, you calculated its period and fulfilled its count. So when the clay is taken from its jars, you work the trick in it, and drink its purity before he who clarifies it and serves it. So may the pure wine not be wholesome for you, which you repel (others) from with the palm. You crowd the most generous class, and drink it like sand in summer.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Bakr al-Khawarizmi regarding Veiling (Hijab)\"\n\"Abu Nasr, gently with veiling... For you are not that great man.\nAnd do not be stingy with that face from us... For it is not that beautiful face.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"I will leave this door as long as its permission is... As I see, until it softens a little.\nIf I do not find a trick for permission with you... I found a way to leave coming.\"\nGently, Abu Nasr, with this long veiling. For you are not that great man, nor is your face that beautiful, nor your gift that abundant, nor your shade that shading. I have abandoned your door, and left you and your veil, until what was difficult of your permission becomes easy, and what was hard of it becomes simple. If I do not find a way to enter upon you, I found it to leave coming to you. Peace be upon other than you.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"By my life, if you veiled the slaves... With your door, the rhyme is not veiled.\nI will throw it from behind the wall... Hideous, bringing you calamity.\nIt deafens the hearer and blinds the seer... And safety is asked for without it.\"\nIf you veiled the slaves from you, and the severe rejection from you faced me, they did not veil from you the circulating rhymes and the dazzling rare meanings. I throw them from behind your wall, and attack your house with them. I send them as burning thunderbolts, disturbing calamities, scorpions and snakes. They deafen ears, blind eyes, strike skins, and tear veils. Without them, Allah is asked for safety and lasting protection. No trade profited for one who made his honor a target for my speech and set himself as a goal for my arrows.\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Ibn Tabataba al-Alawi\"",

And to wash if he dies of hunger.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"They set up the sentry on a hill... And said: Do not sleep, to the sentry.\nIf you see a person from afar... Then clap with fingers on fingers.\nYou see them, out of fear of guests, mute... Establishing prayer without Adhan.\"\nYou asked me - may Allah keep you - about So-and-so. You have fallen upon the expert and encompassed the clarity of his state. Know that he is the image of miserliness, the person of stinginess, the statue of meanness, and the mold of blameworthy character. Whenever I entered upon him, complaining of the tightness of my hand to him, and seeking what is in his hands, he knotted for me four thousands, and decreased seven from them without dispute (referring to a hand gesture indicating nothing/zero). I have an anecdote with a water-carrier, one of the wittiest of his likes and most naturally gifted of his forms. I saw him running with the waterskin to his house. I said: Why do you carry water to one who is stingy with bread to his family let alone his visitors? He said: To sprinkle on the face of whom he fears for from emptiness (hunger), and to wash with it whoever dies of hunger. No wonder, he is of a people known for miserliness and described with meanness. They take their caution against guests, and see in them the edge of swords. They set up the sentry on the hill overlooking the regions and districts, and advise him to be awake and sharpen the eye, until if he sees a person, he claps with hands. Another anecdote is that you hear nothing from them but whispering, and you see them, out of fear of guests, mute. They, in most times and moments, establish prayer without Adhan. It is fitting for those whose qualities are these that their union not be sought. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn Bassam\"\n\"Abu Ja'far built a house and erected it... And the like of him is a builder of good houses.\nBeautiful is its exterior and hunger is its interior... And in its sides are misery and harm.\nWhat does the decoration of his house benefit a man... While there is no good nor water in its hollow?\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"If you desire his drinking companionship... Then lift your right hand from his food.\nFor death is lighter to him... Than a guest chewing and swallowing.\nEqual are the breaking of his loaf... Or the breaking of a bone of his bones.\"\nAnd the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\n\"Isa skimps on himself... And he is neither remaining nor immortal.\nIf he could, for his skimping... He would breathe from one nostril.\"\nOf the quaint news, O my master - may I be your ransom - is that So-and-so built a house that buildings lower their heads in shame from, and palaces admit falling short of. Its exterior is beauty complete, and its interior is hunger existing. What benefits the noble house and the beautiful buildings in it, while there is nothing in it to feed, nor found in its regions what to nibble? Mentioning the man, if you desire his friendship, lift your right hand from his table. Because red death is lighter to him than the guest moving his jaws before him. Equal to him are the breaking of his neck and the breaking of his loaf. If he could, for his cold estimation and increasing skimping, he would breathe from one nostril. This is a little of his many uglinesses, and some of the flood of his scandals. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\n\"Lo, O hated of Allah and son of his hated one... I see hatred of old in your father and in you.\nYour father is the Imam of people in hatred, all of them... And you are the Crown Prince after your father.\"\nAnd the saying of another:\n\"O you from whom Allah turned away... The world out of his hatred.\nAnd O you whose part testifies...

Chapter on Proverbs \"A Poem by Abu al-Fath al-Busti and the Untying of Every Verse according to the Proverb Written Under It\" A man's increase in his world is a decrease... And his profit other than pure good is a loss. Increase in the world is decrease. And every finding of a luck that has no stability... For its meaning in verification is a loss. Whoever found what has no stability has lost it. O builder of the ruined house diligently... By Allah, is there for the ruin of life a construction? O builder of his house and property, are you able to build what was ruined of your life? O greedy for wealth collecting it... Have you forgotten that the joy of wealth is sorrows? The path of wealth is sorrow and its joy is sorrow. Do good to people, you will enslave their hearts... For long has kindness enslaved the human. Kindness enslaves the human. And be upon Time a helper to a hopeful one... Who hopes for your dew, for the free man is a helper. Help the brothers, for the free man is a helper against Time. And strengthen your hands with the rope of religion, holding fast... For it is the pillar if pillars betray you. Hold fast to the rope of religion, for it is the firm rope. Whoever fears Allah is praised in his consequences... And He suffices him the evil of those who were mighty and those who were lowly. Whoever fears Allah wears wellness and praises the consequence. Whoever seeks help from other than Allah in a request... Then his helper is inability and disappointment. Whoever seeks help from other than Allah, his helper disappoints him. Whoever is generous with money, people incline entirely... To him, and money is a temptation for humans. Whoever is generous with money, people incline to him. Whoever makes peace with people is safe from their calamities... And lives cool of eye, joyful. Whoever makes peace with people is safe. Whoever has the authority of reason over him tomorrow... Greed has no authority over his soul. Whoever the authority of reason possesses, the authority of greed does not rule over him. Whoever associates with people encounters fatigue from them... Because their nature is transgression and aggression. Whoever associates with people is not safe from their calamities. And whoever searches for brothers hates them... For most brothers of this age are traitors. The brothers of this time are traitors. Whoever sows evil reaps in its consequences... Regret, and for reaping the crop is a time. Whoever sows evil reaps regret. Whoever relies on the wicked sleeps while in... His shirt from them is a viper and a snake. Whoever relies on the wicked wears his shirt over vipers. Be moist of cheerfulness, for the free man, his ambition is... A page upon which cheerfulness is a title. Cheerfulness is the title of the free man's kindness. And accompany gentleness in all matters, then... No companion regrets nor does a human blame him. Whoever accompanies gentleness, his companions praise him. And let not a luck dragged by clumsiness deceive you... For clumsiness is destruction and a man's gentleness is construction. Gentleness builds and clumsiness destroys. Do good if there is possibility and ability... For possibility will not last upon doing good. Seize doing good as long as there is possibility. Protect the freedom of your face and do not tear its veils... For every free man is a protector of the free face. The free man is the one who protects the freedom of his face. If you meet an enemy, meet him always... With the face by cheerfulness and radiance covered. Extinguish the fire of enmity with the water of cheerfulness. Leave laziness in good deeds seeking them... For no lazy person becomes happy with good deeds. Most often, laziness and happiness do not gather. The shade of a man is stripped of piety and intellect... Even if leaves and branches shaded him. If a man is stripped of the shade of piety and intellect, he is exposed to the sun even if shaded. And people are helpers of the one whose state befriended him... And they are against him if it became hostile to him, helpers. People are helpers of the owner of the state, and they are against him if it turns. And do not entrust the secret to a slanderer, humiliating it... For no wolf tended sheep in the desert. Do not entrust the secret to a slanderer, just as you do not entrust the wolf with sheep.",

    "text": "Not every water is like Sada' for its drinker... Yes, nor is every plant a Sa'dan. Not every roof is a sky. Nor every water Sada'. Nor every branch Khayzuran. Nor every plant Sa'dan. And for managements are knights; if they gallop... In them, they excel just as war has knights. For the management of affairs are knights, just as for fighting are knights of wars. Do not scratch with procrastination the face of a favor... For kindness is scratched by procrastination and delay. Do not scratch with the nail of procrastination the face of the favor. Suffice from living what has blocked a need... And in it for the free man is contentment and sufficiency. Suffice from living a sufficiency that blocked a need. The content person is pleased with his living... And the owner of heat (greed), even if rich, is angry. The content is pleased even if poor. And the greedy is angry even if rich. Suffice the youth his mind as a friend he associates with... If brothers and friends avoid him. Suffice the youth his mind as a friend if friends avoid him. They are two suckling brothers: wisdom and piety... And inhabitants of a homeland: money and tyranny. Wisdom and piety are suckling brothers. And money and tyranny are racehorses. If a homeland rejects a noble man, he has... Behind it in the vast earth homelands. If his homeland rejects a noble man, then the earth is his homelands and people are his brothers. O oppressor, rejoicing in glory, helped... If you are in a slumber, then Time is awake. If you are in a slumber from your glory, Time is awake. Whoever finds injustice palatable, if its eater were fair... While he finds the taste delicious, is suffering (Khatban). The eater does not find injustice palatable, just as the taster does not find Colocynth sweet. O scholar of pleasing biography... Rejoice, for you are quenched without water. O scholar, you are quenched without water. And O brother of ignorance, you have become in depths... So you are amidst them undoubtedly thirsty. O ignorant one, you are thirsty in the depth. Do not think joy lasts forever... Whoever a time pleases, times displease him. Do not think joy lasts, for whoever a time pleases, times displease him. O strutting in the lush youth, intoxicated... From its cup, did a drunkard attain guidance? The drunkenness of youth is like the drunkenness of wine. Do not be deceived by a lush, moist youth... For how many youths advanced before greyness. Do not be deceived by youth, for the old Sheikh may carry the funeral of the small child. Suppose greyness shows the excuse of its owner... What is the excuse of a grey-haired one whom a devil seduces? What is the excuse of the Sheikh if he does not triumph with his authority over his devil? All sins, Allah forgives them... If sincerity and faith accompany the man. Sins are forgiven with true sincerity. And every break, religion mends it... And what breaks the channel of religion has no mending. Every break is mended by religion, and there is no mending for the break of religion. \"Likewise a Poem by Abu Abdullah the Blind Al-Abiwardi\" My fasting, if I break fast with illicit gain, is error... And my knowledge, if it does not benefit, is a type of ignorance. I do not count fasting if I break fast with Haram. And if knowledge does not benefit, it is a type of ignorance. And my purifying (Zakat) money I collected from usury... Is calculation, and some generosity is taken from miserliness. Like the thief of pomegranates from her neighbor's vine... Visiting the sick with them and coveting virtue. And a prostitute giving the poor her earnings... She has nothing but toil upon the kiss (or acceptance?). Whoever purifies money collected from usury is like the thief of pomegranates doing good to the sick with them. And the prostitute giving the poor the wage of adultery. And whoever traveled carried by the fangs of a wolf... It is better for him than his traveling barefoot. Riding the fangs of the wolf is better than walking. The crow comforts the wolf in all his hunting... And what the crows hunted in the palm fronds. The wolf shares with the crow in his little catch, and what the crow hunts in the tops of palms. To a disobedient mother who does not see the cradle of her child... Is dearer than the wet-nurse kind to the child. The harsh mother is kinder to the boy than the kind wet-nurse. If the sheep turn returning from the emptiness... Their crooked goat becomes leading the herd. If the sheep turn back, the lame goat advances. If the owls neighbor the falcons, their... Buttocks (or bowels) are cut from the intensity of fear. If the owls neighbor the falcons, their buttocks are cut. And the hawk is not frightened if it dives from above... By the shouting of the crane screaming from below. The hawk is not frightened by the shouting of the crane. If there is enmity between the two she-camels... Then woe to the bug from the urgent killing. Woe to the bug from the enmity of the two she-camels.",

    "text": "Two camels, this one does not stand out of stupidity... And this is difficult, not kneeling for the saddle. One of the two camels does not stand from its stupidity, and the other does not kneel for its difficulty. Lo, indeed the sheep is only hung by its leg... So what is the matter with people I do not bear their burdens? Every sheep is hung by its leg. Leave me and my caution of matters I tested... For the stung one may fear the sparkle of the rope. Whoever the speckled snake bit fears the piebald rope. Whoever walks in the trace of the lion, his kebab increases... And the harm of drought is not upon the neighbor of the Prince. Whoever follows the lion to the den eats his Tabahajah (meat dish) the fat wild ass. And an old woman whose little broth spilled said... Lo, welcome to dry bread without work. The old woman's broth spilled, so she was content with dry bread. And how many a washer of his palms attained his lunch... From people, who did not wet his palms with washing. Indeed, he eats his lunch who provides him, not who washes his hand. And how many a donkey went seeking a horn... And returned without an ear, and that was of stupidity. The donkey went out seeking two horns, and returned without two ears. And from a magpie that desired the walk of a partridge... So it forgot its walk and did not walk like the partridge. The magpie wanted to imitate the walk of the partridge, so it forgot its walk and did not take the walk of another. And many a wolf passed by the people hungry... So they said: Shortness of breath overcame him from excessive eating. Many a hungry wolf is accused of fullness. And a wolf whom preachers called to repentance... Said: The sheep escape, stop the blame. The wolf was asked to repent, so he said: Leave me, let not the sheep escape me. And every dust that rose from the walking of a flock... That is better for the wolf's eye than kohl. The dust of sheep is better for the wolf's eye than kohl. If the dog could desire a resting place... Other than the basket full of bread and snacks. If the dog could, he would not rest except in the full basket. And you are but a mouse whose hole narrowed... So it tied to itself the bundles from a thick broom. The mouse's hole did not fit it, so it accompanied a broom. You see vinegar as sharp when water is scarce... And in the opposite is the weakness of the thing and strength in the shape. Vinegar where there is no water is sour. Do you see the mote in the eye of another... And neglect the stump obstructing your eyes? Do you see the mote in your brother's eye and not see the pebble in your eye? Leave searching and digging for every hidden thing... If you attained herbs, be distracted from the place of growth of herbs. Eat the herbs and do not ask about the vegetable garden. And hasten to catch the thief before his hastening... To catch you, and be sure of the dirty thief. Catch the thief before he catches you. And couple the donkey with your palfrey if it weakens... From the enemy, it takes from its manners nobility. Tie the donkey with the palfrey, if it does not take from its running, it takes from its character.\n\nChapter on Descriptions and Similes\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz describing the Crescent\"\nWelcome to a Fitr (breaking fast) whose crescent has shone... Now, so go early to the wine and come early. And look at it like a boat of silver... Burdened by a load of ambergris. \"And the saying of the other describing it\" O Reem (gazelle), rise now, woe to you, and look... At the face of the crescent when it appeared in the East. Like a female friend (Khalilah) who looked at a male friend (Khalil) of hers... So she veiled herself in shame with a blue sleeve. \"And the saying of Kushajim describing it also\" Welcome and hello to the crescent... It appeared to the eye of the seer. Like a grain of barley of silver... Mounted on a dagger. \"And the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz\" And the crescent of Shawwal, its light shines... And the Daughters of Na'sh (Ursa Major) stood opposite it. Like the fingertip of a sincere one when he saw... The face of the Vizier, he prayed for the length of his survival. Welcome to a Fitr whose East has raised its crescent, and the East was adorned with it. As if it is the face of a beautiful, morning-like female friend, who was ashamed of her friend so she veiled herself, and with the blue sleeve she covered her face. Or as if it is a boat of silver full of ambergris. Or a grain of barley of silver mounted on a dagger. Or the finger of a sincere one in loyalty to our Master the Prince, the Master, the Just King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah strengthen his victory - when he saw in his face the two moons, and in his person the two weights (Jinn and Mankind). He prayed to Allah for the length of his survival, the continuity of his blessings, and the suppression of his enemies. So greetings now to the wine, and the morning faces, from morning to morning. And drink to the Ma'muni state which is the state of auspiciousness. And thanks to the Khwarazm Shahi days which are the days of beauties. May Allah perpetuate them as long as the crescent shines and the appearance of the new moon repeats. \"Another on the Saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz regarding the Morning and the Pleiades\" O my two friends, give me drink... Coffee possessing intoxication.",

    "text": "The night has turned away from us... And the morning folded it a folding. And as if the morning when... It loomed from under the Pleiades. Is a King who approached in the... Crown, ransomed and greeted. The morning drink, O my two friends, the morning drink! May blessings never cease to come to you and go. Do you not see the night turned back and retreated, and the curtain of darkness was torn? The morning folded the darkness just as the King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah perpetuate his kingdom - folds his enemies. And spread the robe of light just as our Master - may Allah strengthen his victory - spreads his brilliance and light. What does the morning resemble, with the Pleiades above it, except our Master the King - may Allah perpetuate his state and highness - with the crown of highness upon him. He is ransomed and greeted. So give me drink to the mention of his high qualities, and delight me with poetry in which Al-Tha'alibi came. Suffice me with that as superior singing and pleasing, yearning hearing. Farewell.\n\n\"A Note on Untying the Saying of the Other describing the Oud and the Songstress\"\nAnd making an Oud speak with a lightened stick (plectrum)... It would have been, were it not for that, non-speaking. Moved by a palm whose fingertips seem... Tubes of pearls collared with carnelian. \"And the saying of the other\" And as if it is in her lap a child of hers... She embraced it between upper chest and breast. At times she tickles his belly, and if he erred... She rubbed for him an ear of the ears. I have, my master - may I be your ransom - a songstress who brings down fortunes. When she makes the Oud speak with a light Oud, good of dancing. Moved by a palm whose fingertips are in proportion to verification. Tubes of pearls capped with carnelian. The Oud in her lap resembles nothing but a child she beds her breast. She tickles his belly, and if he errs, she rubs his ear. Her hearing refused to be pleasant except with your presence. Just as our joy swore not to be complete except with your joy. If you see to allocate for us a share in your nearness which is the nourishment of the soul and the substance of intimacy, you will have done so, God willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other describing the Narcissus\"\nAs if she applied kohl to an eye with his eye... And as if his leaves are papers. \"And the saying of the other describing the Citron\" A body of silver whose shirt is gold... Compounded in a wondrous composition. In it for the one who smells it and sees it... Is the color of a lover and the scent of a beloved. \"And the saying of the other regarding the Bitter Orange\" It glances at us among the branches as if it is... Breasts of virgins touched by perfume (Khaluq). \"And the saying of Ibn al-Rumi regarding the Violet\" And lazurite ones fulfilling with their blueness... Amidst the gardens upon red rubies. As if they are above layers slapped with them... The beginnings of fire in the tips of sulfur. I am, my master and lord - may Allah prolong your survival - in a gathering like a sample of Paradise. Around me is narcissus whose leaf is like paper and whose eye is like the eye. And citron wearing the shirt of gold over the body of silver, combining the color of the yearning lover with the scent of the beloved adored. And bitter orange as if it is balls of gilded leather, or breasts of veiled, saffron-perfumed virgins. And violet exceeding red rubies and imitating the beginnings of fire in sulfur. The sun of jars has risen, and the stars of drinking companions have appeared, and the tongues of lutes have spoken. If you favor by attending, you will share with us in joy, God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Rumi describing a Chicken and Qata'if (Pancakes)\"\nAnd a scalded one, yellow, dinar-like in price... And color, Hazu (luck?) brought it to you. We remained peeling its skin from its meat... As if gold is peeled from silver. And Qata'if came after that, subtleties... The uvula is pleased with them and the throat is pleased. Faces laughed from the sugar (Tabarazad) over them... Tears of eyes are squeezed from the fats. What is your say, my master - may Allah make me your ransom - regarding a chicken dripping with ghee, dinar-like in color and price? If you extend the hand to its fresh sides, you peel gold from silver. Followed by subtle Qata'if, freshly made, thin of crust, thick of stuffing. Laughing from the crushed sugar, weeping from the pounded almond oil. Paying the taste of wellness and concluding with the good outcome. Will you be active for it and please me by helping with it? God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on the Saying of Al-Buhturi describing the Cloud\"\nPossessing rumbling with the yearning of thunder... Dragging the tail, truthful of promise. Shedding tears without passion... Having a breeze like the breeze of the rose. And a ring like the roar of the lion... And a flash of lightning like the swords of India. The wind of the East brought it from Najd... So it scattered like the scattering of a necklace. And the earth went with a luxurious life... As if its streams in the low land. Were playing with Backgammon from its bubbles.",

    "text": "My master and lord - may Allah prolong your survival - do you not see this cloud, how its tails dragged, and its approach announced fertility? Its thunderers rumbled and its promises came true. Its tears overflowed without passion. Its breeze is like the breeze of the organized rose, its ring like the roar of lions, and its lightning like the flashing of swords between rows. When the wind of the East brought it, and it imitated in its goodness the ornament of youth, its necklace was untied and its contract scattered. It imitated the palm of our Master the King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah perpetuate his kingdom - in its overflowing with gifts and its generosity with connections and presents. So the earth went with the most auspicious ascendant and happiest, and the most pleasant life and most comfortable. As if the streams play Backgammon with its bubbles, and the cloud weeps longing for its loved ones. Since we have been watered from the pouring downpour, give us drink from the water of grapes, and gather for us the reunion of amusement and mirth.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ahmad ibn Sulayman ibn Wahb regarding the Cypress\"\nSurrounded by Cypress like songstresses dressed... In green silk on a moderate stature. As if they, while the wind struts among them... Intend embracing, then shyness prevents them. \"And the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz regarding the Narcissus\" As if the eyes of the fresh narcissus around us... Are vessels of pearls whose stuffing is carnelian. If the drops wet them, I thought their tears... The weeping of eyes whose kohl is perfume (Khaluq). We, our master - may Allah prolong your survival - are in a garden surrounded by cypress lined up like the statures of loved ones in green clothes. As if they, while the wind struts in them, swaying and bending them, intend embracing and holding, and want joining and healing. Shyness prevents them, and fear repels them. Around us are eyes of narcissus imitating vessels of pearls whose stuffing is carnelian. If the drops wet them, their tears imitate the weeping of eyes whose kohl is perfume. The beauty of the place and the goodness of the time have called for seeking support against sorrows with the daughters of jars. They are not pure except with meeting you. So do not muddy by your delay, and burden your foot to us, and bestow your generosity upon us. God willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Bakr al-Khawarizmi regarding Perfume\"\nAnd perfume that does not betray every perfume... Greets us with the breaths of the beloved. The tail remains covering it but... The buttons of pockets tell on it. Whenever a nose smells it, a heart yearns... As if the nose is the spy of hearts. My master - may Allah prolong his survival - narrates in the Sunnah which is all good and blessing, that gifts are shared. Gifted to me is perfume, superior, wondrous, which imitates the breaths of the beloved. Rather, as if it is kneaded from the morals of our Master the Supported King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah strengthen his victory - or as if it is the good praise on his days, shining with his beneficence and favoring. So I shared with my master - may Allah perpetuate his support - in his good trace and good news. I sent of it what, if it prays to the fire of the incense burner, breathes the scent of Paradise. And if the tails cover it, the pockets tell on it, spirits find rest in it, and hearts yearn. He - may Allah perpetuate his glory - pleases me by accepting it, and signs to me its receipt. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Sanawbari\"\nGild your cups, O boy... For it is a silvered day. And the atmosphere reveals in whiteness... And in the ornaments of pearls it displays. Do you think this snow and this... Roses on the branches being shaken? The rose of spring is colored... And the rose in Kanun (winter) is white. This, my master - may Allah perpetuate your glory - is a silvered day, and gilding cups in it is obligatory. Do you not see the atmosphere revealing and displaying in whiteness, and pearls in ornaments? So do not think it snow, for it is shaken on the branches. The rose is white in Kanun as it is colored in Nisan. Since the necklace of the sky has untied, let the necklace of drinking companions be organized. You, my master, are the central jewel of the necklace, and the first of the knot. So favor and hasten, and do not delay. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Sahib\"\nThe atmosphere approached in robes of light... And gifted scattered pearls. As if the sky became an in-law to the earth... And the scattering became of camphor. This, my master - may Allah prolong your survival - is a day whose air approached in robes of light and came to us with scattered pearls. Until as if the sky became an in-law to the earth, and scattered for it pure camphor. So scatter upon us joy with your countenance, and assist us with your help, on what we resolved of mounting the vehicles of joy, and striking the fire of mirth with the cup. God willing.\n\nChapter\nNayrouz and Mehregan\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Professor Abu Bakr al-Khawarizmi from a Poem\"\nO King who fulfilled with his ambition... Over the worries of the kings of the earth and ambitions. Be happy with the rising of this Nayrouz and note it... For it will not stay for a creature and has not stayed. A day of Time, an old man in his youth... And renewed, and what comes of the ancient. Kisra used to, if it came to him, make it judge... Over his mind, and he is the worst of who judged in it. An old man visited by an old man, so he shook hands with him... With the cup and the bowl and the strings and the tunes. A new day and a kingdom fresh... And sobriety between them is a type of madness.",

    "text": "May Allah make our Master the Supported King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah, whose ambition fulfilled the high ambitions of all nations, happy with this new season and praiseworthy Nayrouz. Which is, despite its youth, an old Sheikh of ancient attribution, and despite his old age, a youth of recent birth. Kisra used to revere it if it came to him, and honor it if it arrived. He placed it in the place of the dearest comer, and made it judge over his mind while it is the worst judge. Oh what an old Sheikh, who used to visit a generous Sheikh. So he shook hands with him with wine, took off for him the clothes of dignity, and treated him kindly with tunes and strings. Our Master - may Allah perpetuate his kingdom - is the inheritor of Kings; Allah inherited him their ages, lands, and homes. So what is upon him if he preserved the Kisraic customs as he preserves the Hanifite Sharia? To seek help with jest for seriousness, and with falsehood for truth, and rest sometimes from the bitterness of policies to the sweetness of intimacies. May Allah combine for him the benefits of religion and the world, as He combined for him the characteristics of glory and highness. May the seasons and years, months and days, never cease to be congratulated by what they wore of beauty by his place, and what was pure for them of transmitted virtue by his justice and benevolence.\n\n\"Another on Untying his Saying also\"\nNayrouz has come to you as a guest, so he attacked... A young day while he is a Sheikh in age. Time aged him but he did not accept decrepitude... If the army of cold sees him, it is defeated. The defeat of miserliness if your mouth smiles... His eye is the cup and his ears are the melodies (Ni'am - could also mean blessings/livestock but tunes fit context). He is without these two blind and deaf... So descend to his rulings for he has judged. That the night comes while in the mind is a gap... And know that wine was not named one day. Its antidote except that this mind is poison. Nayrouz approached our Master the King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah prolong his survival - increasing the blackness (number) of his guests and servants, quoting from the light of his presence and days. It is a day young of age, fresh of branch. Although it is a Sheikh that long accompanied the past days, and saw the past centuries. Long did age fold it, and time aged it, but decrepitude did not remain. Whenever the army of cold saw it, it turned away retreating and was defeated, just as miserliness is defeated, and deprivation and drought flee if the mouth of our Master the King - may Allah perpetuate his authority - smiles. Time smiled by his smiling, and the faces of noble deeds beamed for his favoring. If Nayrouz were a human, wine would be his eye and listening his ear. He is without these two blind, not seeing the sun, and deaf, not hearing the thunder. Among his rulings at which youthfulness descends and chivalry does not reject, is that the night does not lower its curtains except drunkenness has dragged its tails, and the reddish wine has walked in the bones and ascended to the heads, and the mind is gapped with every gap. In reality, wine was not named the antidote of worries except that the mind is counted among poisons. Whenever the poison is less, it is better, and whenever it is missing, it is more restful. May Allah protect our Master the King from every evil and subjugate every enemy to him, and make him know of the blessings of the bright day what exceeds the number of Eid, Nayrouz, and Mehrejan. May every day of his days never cease to be a present Eid and a fresh Nayrouz, as long as days and months last and years and ages recur.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\nCome early to Nayrouz with wine... And the basil of joy. Among drinking companions who made play... Lines in the chests. And a singer who improves the tunes... On the bass string and the high string (Zir). He almost reveals when... He sang, the secret of the conscience. O Nayrouz, may you never cease... Delicious to the Prince. In the safety of Allah on earth... From the illuminating Time.\"",

    "text": "The right of Nayrouz, O my master and lord - may Allah perpetuate your glory - is its blessing with wine, basil, and relief. With drinking companions who wrote amusement in the lines of their chests, and sought victory over Time by attracting their joy. And a singer who chases away the whispers of worry by making the Zir (high string) and Bam (bass string) speak. He almost reveals the consciences, tears the veils of secrets, guides joy to the core of hearts, and relieves them of all distresses, if he sings the mention of the Auspicious King, Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun. May Allah keep him a blaze in the face of his time, and a crown on the parting of his age, and look after noble deeds and high ranks by prolonging his life and elevating his status and command. So come, my master, let us fulfill the right of Nayrouz, and dry the thirst of souls by circulating cups, and hear from the doctors of worries songs that gather wishes. God willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\nBe happy with the day of Mehregan, for it is... A day that has virtue over days. The Kings of Persia used to elevate its rank... So establish their customs by drinking wine. And meet it with amusement and know its right... And be merry with boon companions and servants. May you never cease in honor and lasting glory... As long as doves warble in the thicket. May Allah make you happy, my master and chief, and us, the assembly of servants of our Master the King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah strengthen his victory - with this Mehregan which is in days like he is in mankind. And may He inspire us to thank the blessing in his survival, the extension of his shades, and his running the course of rain when it encompasses and covers, and the horn of the sun when it rises and shines. You have known, my master - may I be your ransom - that this day is among the beauties of famous ages and the blazes of mentioned times. Honored in the Persian origin, deemed witty in the Arab kingdom. Its custom must be established and its rule accepted. Establishing its custom is by emptying oneself for intimacy, running in the field of amusement, rising the sun of wine and the star of the drinking companion, feeding ears delicious listening, reaching every extent of fulfilling desires, and stirring dormant joys. If you visit me for this affair, otherwise I visit you to fulfill the right of Mehregan. The choice is yours, and reliance in gathering the reunion is upon you. May you never cease in fixed glory and constant joy as long as doves warble on trees and gardens breathe at dawns.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\nI chose on the day of Mehregan a gift... And employed truthful thinking in the omen. So I gifted a new dinar and a dirham... An arrow, an apple, a walnut, and sugar. I said: Your affair, all of it, straightened like the arrow... And may your face never cease shining like the apple. And striving succeeded from you like the dirham by which... The desired is attained, easy, facilitated. And like the fullness of the walnut, may your houses never cease... To be filled with good things, gold, and jewels. And may you never cease sweet in hearts like sugar... And may you never cease like the dinar in beauty and appearance. I have walked with you, O my master and lord - may Allah prolong your survival - in this new Mehregan and happy Eid, the path of praiseworthy omen. I gifted you a dinar which is the precious object surpassing objects, by which its owner is safe from poverty. I intended by it that Allah gives you what He gave it of love in every heart, and success and prosperity in every matter. And with it a dirham, I took as an omen that Allah strengthens you with His strength in the regions, and makes you reach your reach of desires. And an arrow, I intended that your affair imitates its straightness, and resembles its penetration and sharpness. And an apple, I wanted you to resemble it in good appearance and good substance. And a walnut, I loved that your house be filled with good like its fullness, and stuffed with blessings like its stuffing. And sugar, I sought blessing for you with what is in its taste of sweetness which I hope days accompany you with, and years are organized by its extension for you, so its harvest is sweet to you and its pasture fertile with you.

    "text": "If our Master the Supported King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah prolong his survival - is the person of Glory and Generosity, and Bounty ran from him the course of blood, then let the hand of the phlebotomist be gentle with the hand that is the Qibla of seekers, and in which are the provisions of the poor, and by which is the crescent of the promise. Do not spill blood that is Bounty and existing Generosity. If the situation necessitated that, we have seen illness mixing tears with its blood, just as we saw wellness laughing the fill of its mouth. That blood in the high hand was extreme generosity, so from fear of separating from it, it transformed into flowing blood. Our Master - may Allah guard his life - resumed a new health and a satisfied, praiseworthy life, and wore the robe of sufficient safety lined with wellness. Praise be to Allah as long as a tongue speaks with praise and a fingertip moves. And His prayers be upon Muhammad, the best born who called to the best Worshipped.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Speaker\"\nMay you never cease in health from time... Sickness does not graze in a body of yours. And may the benefit of medicine circulate in you as... The water of spring circulates in the branch. Allah provided the protection of our Master the Supported King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah in his safety from disease, and made him know the blessing of what he took of medicine. He made its benefits flow in his auspicious body just as spring water flows in the wood (branch). He sufficed him the turbidity of watering places and the objection of calamities. He made the udders of wellness flow for him, and bestowed upon him the robes of ample blessings.\n\nChapter\nSpring\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Abu Nuwas\"\nDo you not see the sun has settled in Aries... And the scale of time stood and balanced? And birds sang after their muteness... And wine fulfilled its power around them completely. And the earth clothed itself from its decorations... Embroidered plants you think are robes. So drink to the newness of time, for... The face of time has become advancing (welcoming). Do you not see, my master - may Allah perpetuate your glory - spring has approached, the sun has settled in Aries, and the scale of time has balanced? No scorching heat nor grim cold. Birds spoke after they were dumb, and their lutes sang while they were mute. Wine fulfilled its power around them. The earth took its decoration and ornament, clothed itself in its pleasing robes, and wore its exciting jewelry. So drink to the new time, enjoy the happy life, and be delighted with the moderate season and its cheerful, advancing face. By my life, spring in the days of King Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun resembles the time of Paradise promised to the pious. Whoever Allah made happy to reach it and shade in its shadows, his life is youth, drink, and loved ones. His time is spring, his life is fertile, and his intimacy is wondrous. May Allah perpetuate them as long as trees leaf and the moon rises.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\nStop at a quarter for spring and be in it... A guest, your boon companions will be the lights (flowers). From green in red in yellow... In white, their dyer is the Compeller (Al-Jabbar). Come, my master - may Allah prolong your survival - let us stop at a quarter for spring gathering gardens wrapped together. We establish in it guests as we wish. Our boon companions are lights, and our sitters are flowers. Between red to yellow, and white in green. Their dyer is Allah, than whom there is no better dye nor subtler craft. Their singers are birds, to whose singing trees sway, twist, and bend. We are more worthy of mirth and fulfilling the wish than the blood of grapes. This is a short from a long. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Sanawbari\"\nIf summer is basil and fruit... Then the earth is a fireplace and the atmosphere is an oven. And if in autumn the palm tree is harvested... Then the earth is naked and the atmosphere is cold. And if in winter the rain is continuous... Then the earth is besieged and the atmosphere is captive. Time is nothing but the illuminating Spring... If Spring comes, Light and Flowers (Nur and Nawr) come to you. So the earth is a ruby and the atmosphere is a pearl... And the plant is turquoise and the water is crystal. Blessed is Allah! How sweet is Spring... So do not be deceived, for he who compares it to summer is deceived. Whoever smells the scent of the picked flowers of Spring says... Musk is not musk nor camphor is camphor.",

    "text": "Spring, my master and lord - may Allah prolong your survival - is the youth of time, the newness of the world, and the spirit of spirits. It is the season that has the merit with its splendid appearance, fragrant substance, joyful beauties, and fragrant characteristics. Eyes have a pasture in its lights, and souls have enjoyment in its breeze. Each of the seasons has beauties and virtues, and evils and defects, except Spring, for it is all good and pleasant, having no share in defects. If Summer is the time of basils and fruits, and the season of harvest maturity, then the earth is from the fuel of heat a carpet of embers, and the air is like the heated oven and the heart of the abandoned lover. If Autumn is the time of picking grapes and harvesting dates, the winds in it are harsh and sticks dry, and the scorpions of cold do not desist nor lighten. If the Winter season is liked for the continuity of moisture, in its cold is hardship and in its air is roughness. Many a day has a grim frown, baring a fang of severe cold. The moderate season, the advancing time, the looked-at loved time is nothing but the beloved adored Spring. If it comes, intimacy and joy come, and Light and Flowers approach. Beauty approaches smiling and almost speaking. If you see it, you see a handsome face, massive favor, breeze wind, raining cloud, and fragrant scent. Gardens like brides in their jewelry and cloaks, and peacocks in their embroidery and decorations. Trees whose arranged flowers pleased and fresh leaves thinned. So the earth is emerald, ruby, and crumbled musk. The orchards are brocade, roses, necklaces, and knots. The atmosphere is scattered pearls and a spread robe of light. Water is swords and crystal. So Glory be to Allah! How good is Spring and how sweet! How beautiful are its robes and ornaments! By Allah, no one compares it to summer except a deceived one who does not know, or a knower who is not fair. Whoever witnessed Spring and the beauty of its traces, and smelled the scent of its lights and flowers, did not deem pearls and jewels beautiful, nor found musk and ambergris pleasant. The best of Spring's exploits and noblest of its prides is that it resembles the beauties of our Master the Supported King, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah perpetuate his kingdom - even if it did not attain their measure nor reach their virtue. It found no escape from acknowledging them. So it is said: As if its rains are from his generosity and bounty, and its lights from his morals and character, and its flowers the traces of his pen and the blazes of his words, and its breeze the thanks of his servants for his blessings. May times not lack their beauty, and may he never cease to be a full moon in his perfection and a crescent in his growth.\n\nChapter\nWine Poems (Khamriyyat)\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Al-Sahib\"\nSimilars have been gathered, so all of them... Their ghosts are similar spirits.\nIf you want a summarized interpretation of them... Then Wine (Rah), Lamp (Misbah), and Apple (Tuffah).\nThe cupbearer did not know, when they were gathered for me... From which of this he fills the cups.\nThis - may Allah prolong your survival, my master - is a night from which Time turned away (in neglect), its fortunes rose, and its blamers were absent. It is among the good deeds of the world. It has organized me and brothers of mine in the string of the Pleiades. It gathered for us similars, as if they are similar sisters; their bodies are spirits of subtlety, having no end in beauty and wit. If you want a summary of their points and a detailing of their totality, they are the Wine for which spirits find rest, the fragrant Apple, and the third is the Lamp. When they resembled each other to the cupbearer who gives us drink for joy, he did not know from which of them he fills the cup. There is none to alert him to it but you. If you favored by attending, you did well.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn al-Rumi\"\nI saw him with the cup between a mouth... Of his and between five fingertips.\nAs if it and as if its drinker are... A moon kissing the cheek of the sun.\nDrinking - my master and lord, may Allah perpetuate your glory - upon morning faces and beautiful forms is among the blazes of life and opportunities of Time. One of beautiful form, restricted to it, visited me and drank with me wine as if squeezed from his cheek. I did not compare him, with the cup between his mouth and his five fingertips, to anything but the moon kissing the cheek of the sun. I loved that you share with me the joy of seeing him, quoting from the light of witnessing him, and enjoying the spirit by his company. So fly to us the flight of an arrow, and rise upon us like the rising of a star. God willing.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz\"\nShe gave me drink in a night resembling her hair... One resembling her cheeks without a watcher.\nSo she ceased not in two nights of hair and darkness... And two suns of wine and a beloved's face.\n\"And the saying of Al-Nazzam\"\nI ceased not taking the spirit of the jug in kindness... And permitting blood without a wounded one.\nUntil I bent having two spirits in my body... And the jug was thrown, a body without a spirit.",

    "text": "Of my news, my master - may I be your ransom - is that Time aided me with meeting a captivating human, and a comforting gathering brought me and her together. She gave me drink in a night resembling her crow-black hair, one resembling her cheek, with the absence of the watcher. She ceased not in two nights of coal-black hair and attacking darkness, and in two suns of nectar and the elegant face of the beloved. I spent the night taking the spirit of the full skin (wineskin) and draining blood without one wounded by sword or spear. Until I bent, intoxicated, having two spirits in one body and a unique person. The skin was a body with no spirit in its parts and no movement in its blood. This, my master, is my news, so inform me of your news and tell me what delayed you. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Nuwas\"\nGive us drink, for our day is the day of Ram... And Ram has a virtue over days.\nOf a drink more delicious than the look of the beloved... In the face of a lover with a smile.\nNot thick from which nature recoils... The recoil of hearing from hideous speech.\nIn spring meadows upon which the weather came early... With the pouring of clouds.\nYou see the drinkers like crescents in it... Sipping Khusrawi wine.\nYou, my master - may Allah prolong your survival - know that the day of Ram has a virtue over days, and its right is not fulfilled except by wine. So come let us drink what is better than the tunes of the Oud, better than the scent of roses, and more delicious than the look of the beloved to his lover while smiling and speaking all he desires. There is no thickness in it from which the soul flees and nature recoils, just as hearing recoils from the hideous word and the blind speech. We are in meadows surrounded by flowers, woven by the hands of rains. With us are boon companions like moons, drinking suns in cups and persevering in the joy of souls. How worthy you are, my master, of help, for we are two bodies with one spirit. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other in Requesting Wine\"\nMay I be your ransom; some people are with me... And among them is one who loves you like my love.\nAnd in the drink is tightness, and it is a thing... If you send it, you obtain my praise.\nSo send what you can without joking... For water is not tight (scarce) with me.\nA necklace of brothers has been organized, my master and lord, sharing with me in your loyalty and support, and pulling with me the robe of your love and affection. But the reunion of loved ones almost separated due to the lack of drink. So we relied on your customary grace and arrived at your frequented sea. If you quench our thirst with what benefits it, and favor our group with what gathers it, you obtain new thanks and ready praise. The suggestion to your generosity is that you order the sending of the water of the generous (wine), pure, unmixed with anything of the plain water, for it is present with me and not impossible for me. Farewell.\n\nChapter\nSeeking a Visit\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Abu al-Fath al-Busti\"\nWith me - may I be your ransom - are masters of the free... And their hearts are hot with longing for you.\nOur drink is the drink of the reason (illness/second drink) and... Our garden is the pleasure of hadith and our transmission is poems.\nSo favor us with haste, for... The lives of the times of joy are short.\nWith me, my master - may Allah prolong your survival - are free men who possessed free speech. None of them but is a good deed among the good deeds of days. Affection and intimacy gathered their reunion, and as if their souls in longing for you are one soul. We are in gardens of beautiful conversations, as if they are samples of Paradises. Our drink is sciences flowing in hearts like the flow of water in wood. Our transmission is poems leading their hearer to prostration. The most brilliant is in praise of the Sun of the Kingdom, the Blaze of the Age, the Banner of Virtue, the Central Jewel of the Necklace of Time, and he to whom foreheads bow and with whose mention mouths are pleasant, our Master the King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah prolong his survival and not deprive the world of his light. So favor us by hastening to us, and come to the presence, seizing the time of joy. For the lives of its times are short, and the enjoyment of the world is a borrowed night.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\nOur fingertips have not gathered for months... Upon a dish, for matters hindered from it.\nSo come, not ordered, the evening of our day... For you are an ornament if you attend, and a light.\"\nYou forgot, my master - may I be your ransom - the covenant of our salting with food and suckling with wine. Since the accidents of time hindered our hands from gathering on the dish and table, and sharing in carrying the first juice of jars. So answer the evening of the day, not ordered, and renew for me what the covenant has been long of intimacy and joy. To rectify what was missed of sitting together and its fruit, and wake up intimacy from its slumber. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Tahir\"\nDo you not see the day, its sides have softened... And its caller has called you to pleasures?\nIt was generous with rain until I thought it has... An intimate who distanced himself, so it ceases not to weep for him.",

Until we fulfill for it what we used to fulfill.\nDo you not see, my master - may Allah support you - how its tunics softened, its blamer was absent, and its northern winds called to pleasures? The knot of the sky dissolved in it with pouring rain, until I thought it weeping for a beloved whom separation struck, so it yearns for him and misses him. What do you see regarding fulfilling what the day demands of its right, and meeting it of amusement with its truth? The opinion is that you ride to me, even if on the wings of winds, until we fulfill for it the conditions of intimacy and relief. God Almighty willing.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other\"\nWe have fish we grill, spanning a span... And with our boy is a spiced side.\nAnd two chickens that grazed for a time... The marrow of wheat in the houses of Kaskar.\nAnd a pot, if a prudent one contemplated it... He would be certain it is musk and ambergris.\nAnd pure aged wine (Shamol)... The remainder of what Kisra and Caesar acquired.\nAnd a listener like the color of morning singing... And another like the color of night signaling.\nAnd traces pass so we pick them... From news and embellished poetry.\nSo be for this letter of ours an answer... Otherwise, your whole right is that you are insulted.\nWe have, my master - may Allah support you - fish of a span (size), its motto is silver, its cover is gold. We grill it before us, so it makes us salivate and distracts us. Yes, and with the boy is a spiced side having the most arrows in opening appetite. And two chickens like sugar, fed with marrow. And a pot whose scent flew and whose serving was good. The course of conversation is to the pure wine which is like wellness in the body. From the remainder of what the Romans did not break and the Caesars chose. We have two listeners as if they came from Paradise. One in the color of morning plays and delights, sings and pleases and amazes. The other in the dye of night signals, moving souls, making heads dance, and inciting cups. Among our cups are conversations that please and news that gladden, poems as if all pearls, and traditions all free. If you are, my master, the place of the answer to this letter, (good); otherwise you are exposed to blame and punished the most severe punishment. Far be it from you that. Farewell.\n\nChapter\nLength of the Night\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\nO night, do you have a morning... Or does your star have a departure?\nThe morning lost its way... And the night lost the way from the morning.\nAnd the saying of Sayduk al-Wasiti:\nSo now my night since they were absent, may I ransom them... Is the night of the blind, so my morning is not awaited.\nAnd the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\nMany a night like eternity in length... Ended, so there is no increase in it.\nPossessing stars as if they are the stars... Of greyness, not setting, no, rather increasing.\nAnd the saying of the other:\nAs if the Pleiades is a palm spanning the darkness... To know if the night is long or has become wide.\nI wondered at a night between east and west... Measured by a span, how is its expiration hoped for?\nI complain to you, my master - may Allah perpetuate your glory - of a night in the length of eternity and weight of abandonment. I compare it only to the night of the captive, nay the night of the blind. I compare its stars, which seem shackled not moving and bound not rotating, only to the stars of greyness, not setting, no, rather increasing and not deviating. How often I say: Is there success for the wakeful, and is there a morning for the night? Far from it! This is a night whose wing was clipped and whose morning got lost. As if the Pleiades is a palm spanning the night and its tails, to know its width and length. How is the expiration of a night hoped for, full of braids, extending ropes between easts and wests, measured by a small span or gauged by a short fathom? Aid your brother whom worries conversed with and griefs embraced. Ask Allah for him urgent relief and complete making, by His mercy and breadth of His grace.\n\nChapter\nEmaciation\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Abu al-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi\"\nPassion wore out my body with grief on the day of distance... And abandonment separated between the eyelid and slumber.\nA spirit repeated in the likeness of a toothpick, if... The wind blew the robe off him, he would not be seen.\nEnough of emaciation for my body is that I am a man... Were it not for my addressing you, you would not see me.\nAnd his saying also:\nAnd if a pen were thrown in the split of his head... From illness, it would not change the handwriting of a scribe.\nAnd the saying of Ibn al-Amid:\nIf what remained of my body were a mote... In the eye, it would not prevent sleeping.\nAnd the saying of the other:\nSo I said: If I loved, my handwriting would become... Tiny like its owner, emaciated.\nAnd the saying of Al-Tanukhi:\nYou, not whom I love, O heart, are my adversary... You dressed my body in the robe of illness.",

    "text": "I do not see myself living except because I... Death was blinded to my possibility due to my illness.\nMy letter - may Allah prolong your survival, my master - and desire has extended, since the day of distance, the hand of wear to my body. Abandonment separated between the eyelid and sleep like its separation between the side and the bed. Nothing remained of me but spirits repeated in a body like the toothpick, nay like the phantom. Nay, like the crescent of secrets. If the wind blew the robe off him, he would not appear to sights. Enough of emaciation, slimness, and withering for my body is that were it not for my addressing you, your eyes would not see me. If I were a hair in a scribe's pen, I would not change his script. Or a mote in a sleeper's eye, I would not wake his eyelid. So do not blame me, my master, for the fineness of my handwriting, for it resembles my body. By my life, I went because of my heart, not because of my love. It is what clothed me in the robe of illness and exposed me to the melting of the body. I do not see myself living with this affliction except because I was hidden from Abu Yahya (Angel of Death). Had he seen me, he would not have spared me. But emaciation saved me. Farewell.\n\nChapter\nFeminine Ghazal (Love Poetry)\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Harun al-Rashid\"\nThe three sociable ones possessed my rein... And settled in my heart in every place.\nWhy does all creation obey me... While I obey them and they are in disobedience to me?\nThat is only because the Sultan of Passion... And by it they became strong, is mightier than my Sultan.\nAid, aid! From three slaves (female). They took my heart completely, and possessed my affair, small and big. They settled in me the place of the organ in the body and the membrane in the liver. People obey me while I obey them and they disobey me. Lands and servants are in my possession and ownership, and they own me. That is only because my Sultan is below the Sultan of Passion, and the humiliation of Love overcomes the glory of the Master. Allah is the Helper and to Him is the complaint.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Nuwas\"\nO moon I saw at a funeral... Mourning with grief among peers.\nWeeping, so shedding pearls from narcissus... And slapping the rose with jujube.\nMy eye grazed in the garden of intimacy and the co-wife of the sun. It saw the moon of the earth and the statue of pure beauty in a funeral turned by her into a wedding, and the beauties of the world in her clothes. She mourns among her peers, weeping so scattering pearls from narcissus, and slapping the rose with the comforting jujube. Oh what an elegant sight worthy of wonder!\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Ibn Thawabah\"\nShe came to me rebuking me for weeping... So welcome to her and her rebuke.\nShe says, and in her saying is modesty... Do you weep with an eye with which you see me?\nI said: If it admired other than you... I ordered the tears to discipline it.\nThe enchanting human came to me. As if she is the full moon ringed with Pleiades, and a necklace of Gemini hung on her. She began standing and sitting in my rebuke, going high and low in my scolding. She blames me for the weeping eye and tears flowing like blood. She says: Do you weep with an eye with which you see my face, which is the delight of eyes, the innovation of regions, and the shamer of moons? It is like a hundred thousand dinars. I said to her: If it occupied itself with other than you, and admired other than you, I ordered the tears to discipline it and rub it, and did not permit it to leave it. So she left pleased and did not return complaining.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Nuwas\"\nAnd possessor of a rosy cheek... White (Quhiyyah) of the body (stripped).\nThe eye contemplates in her... Beauties that do not run out.\nSome reach a limit... And some are generated.\nWhenever I returned to her... The return was more praiseworthy for me.\nGlory be to Him who afflicted me with a slave girl tempting with the rose of her cheek and the chamomile of her mouth. Enchanting with the narcissus of her eye and the pomegranate of her chest. Pleasing eyes with black hair just as souls are pleased with the whiteness of the body. I cease not to contemplate in her beauties that do not run out, repeating and returning. Some reach the furthest ends and some are generated at times. Whenever I returned to look at her, the return was more praiseworthy, and my eye was happier with her. Even if my heart was more miserable with her, and my love for her more firm and lasting. May Allah grant me her affection and bend her side to me.\n\nChapter\nMasculine Ghazal\n\n\"A Letter on Untying the Saying of Al-Sahib\"\nA boy like the gazelle and the sun... I saw in him a crescent in a tunic.\nAs if the whiteness of his blaze is guidance... As if the blackness of his forelock is error.\nAs if Allah sent him as a Prophet... And made his beauty the strongest proof.\nWhenever you increased union, I increased in insanity... As if the ropes of your union are ropes (traps) for me.\"",

My eye was not satiated with his beauty, nor was my mind quenched by him. I compared his moon-like blaze to guidance and fresh faith, and his natural forelock to error and pure disbelief. I thought Allah sent him as a Prophet, and guided him to a straight path, and made his beauty his strongest miracles and clearest proofs. Among what I was afflicted with from him is that whenever he increased me in nearness, I increased in love. And if he increased me in union, I increased in insanity. As if the ropes of his union are ropes for my hunting, and as if his helping me is an increase in my shackles. May I not lack his love and satisfaction with what he is pleased with.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Al-Sanawbari\"\nWhere does the full moon get, O boy...

Where does it have the eye which is the delight of eyes, drawing the sword of King Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun? You are nothing but a sun of day and the day is gone, and a moon of darkness and the darkness is absent. Your union is nothing but life, and your abandonment nothing but snakes (deaths).

I would have gifted it to the announcer of his return.\nI ransomed the one whose person was absent from my eye, while I see him in the mirror of my heart and whisper to him with my mind, as if he is present with me. Were it not for the picnicking of my eye in the garden of his beauty and its enjoyment of him at his union, I would have made it a gift to the one who announces to me his approach and clears my distress with the breeze of his return. I ask Allah to fold for him the carpet of the earth until its far becomes near and its difficult softens, by His will and power.\n\nChapter\nThe Line of Cheek-hair (Idhar), its Praise and Dispraise\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Al-Buqri the Scribe\"\nYou burned with blackness the silver of his cheek... Indeed you burned the core (blackness) of hearts.\n\"And the saying of the other\"\nI was hoping that when he grows a beard... It would lighten my sorrows and bring me patience.\nWhen he grew a beard and his cheek-hair blackened... The tribulation increased by one to ten.\n\"And the saying of the other\"\nThey said: He grew a beard so the hair growth... Erased the beauties of his face.\nNow it became good, and that was... Only the day upon the faces.\nWere it not for blackness in the moon... By Allah, the moon would not be beautiful.\nYou asked me - may Allah support you - about the human who possessed my rein when the heart was empty, and acquired my affection while youth was dyeing. Take the news and know that when I burned with hair the silver of his cheek, the core of my heart burned from his love. I was hoping that solace would agree and repulsion would occur when the light of his cheek turned into darkness and the emerald of his line into jet. When spring played with his cheek and added violet to his rose, my love for him increased and my passion for him doubled. Hair is not the beauties of his face, rather the full moon increased in beauty by its blackness, and the garden became pleasant when the flower encompassed it. Farewell.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of the Other, Al-Bassami\"\nO you whose beard announced his death to the brothers... You turned back while people are between approach and retreat.\nYou were of those for whom observers smile... Glances and sights lowered before you.\nDays when your face was polished of cheek-hairs... And for spring on your cheeks were lights.\nHis death approached and his cheek-hair blackened... Just as the house blackens after the dead.\"",

    "text": "O you who died while alive, and lived while being nothing. Hair has announced your death to your brothers, and copied (abrogated) the verse of your beauty with your friends. So you turned back while people are between approach and retreat, and were clothed in two robes of disgrace and ruin. You were of those for whom the observer smiles and to whom thoughts attach. Eyes choked before you since hair transformed your beauty, and hearts turned away from you when Time changed your state. I do not forget but the intimacy of your days, while Paradise is picked from your nearness, the water of beauty ripples in your face, and the lights of spring are dependent on your cheek. So now when your death approached, your wish failed, the shade of life vanished from you, and you became a pledge of passing, and your cheek-hair blackened just as the houses of the dead blacken. Farewell.\n\nChapter Ending the Book with the Mention of Allah Almighty\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of the Poet\"\nPraise be to Allah, the Kind to us... He covered the ugly and showed the beautiful.\nFavors from Him do not end... Except He renews double them of favors.\nIf I busied myself thanking those, I would not... Have become by pleasures pawned.\nWe praise Allah who is Kind to us, and His making surrounds us. He covers the ugly and shows the beautiful, forgives the great and gifts the abundant. Favors from Him do not end except multiples come, nor do their tens wear out except thousands are renewed. Because of His blessings upon us and gifts to us is our happiness in attaining the days of our Master the Supported King Khwarazm Shah - may Allah perpetuate them. They are the chronicles of justice and virtue, and the times of decisive speech and abundant generosity. And our obtaining from his high presence the settled place of highness and the Paradise of the world. And our seeing in him the Earthly Moon and the Pleasing King. And our serving of him, the point of the world and the blaze of the sons of Adam. If we busied ourselves thanking Allah for what He extended over us of the shade of his state, and what we grazed in of the gardens of his blessing, our foreheads would not have left prostration, nor would we have known the cup and the Oud, nor would we have become pawned by seeking pleasures as long as the spirit of life accompanied us. It is incumbent upon us not to unleash tongues at the ends of prayers except for the perpetuation of his kingdom, nor raise hands in the mosques of congregations except for seeking the descent of his victory. Allah hears and answers, indeed He is Near, Responsive.\n\n\"Section on Untying the Saying of Ibn Abi Uyaynah\"\nBy your life, the youth does not know how to protect against... The calamities of this Time, nor how to beware.\nHe sees the thing he protects against and fears... And what he does not see of what Allah protects is more.\nThe calamities of Time are more than the plants of the earth, and no human knows how to protect himself from them and take his caution against them. He may see what he fears and guards against, but what he does not see of what Allah protects him from is more general and more, and more worthy of thanks. Did He not yesterday look at His servants and protect them from evil in the Guardian of His lands, the Just King Khwarazm Shah? He guarded his body and healed him, erased the trace of illness from him and cured him, and exempted him from suffering pain, and kept him for kingship and generosity. Oh what a blessing that raced blessings, removed worries, and raised ambitions. He is the Asked to preserve for the world its beauty by his survival, and divert the vicissitudes of Time from him to his enemies.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Abu Nuwas\"\nGlory be to Him who created creation... From weak, despised (water).\nHe drives them from a resting place... To a firm resting place.\nUntil the movements of His creature... Appeared from stillness.\nGlory be to Him who created the noble soul from despised water, and watered it to the firm resting place. Glory be to Him who created Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun as a mercy for His creation and a proof in His earth. He gathered in him of virtues what He separated in others. He divided beauty between his creation (form) and character, honor between his nature and origin, and generosity between his word and deed. Indeed, He who gave him what cannot be counted nor forgotten of virtues and beauties is Able to make him possess what cannot be limited nor counted of kingdoms and treasures. O Allah, do that, and place upon his moon-like form, his Umari biography, his Alawi ambition, and the pearly traces of his pen, a lasting protection. And grant him a satisfied life in a glory that ceases not to be lofty, and a destiny that ceases not to be agreeing. By Your mercy, O Most Merciful of the merciful.\n\n\"Another on Untying the Saying of Wuhayb al-Himyari\"\nAnd I hope for Allah until as if I... See with beautiful thought what Allah is doing.\"",

Until as if I see with beautiful thought what I have with Him of abundant favor. And that He makes our Master the Supported King Khwarazm Shah run upon the best of what happy ascendants promised and praiseworthy glad tidings indicated of high authority, elevated status, effective command, long life, mighty banner, and attaining the goal until he possesses what the sun rose upon and the blowing of the wind ended at. O Allah, look to the Possessor with that so that You have poured out Good and its motives, and cut off Evil and its consequences, and made mankind sleep in the shade of the Just, and encompassed them with benevolence and virtue. Indeed You are the Most Generous Asked and the Best Hoped. The book \"Scattering the Verse and Untying the Knots\" is completed.\n\n\"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\"\nYour help, O Allah, on thanking Your blessing in a King like an Angel, a Sea in a Palace, a Full Moon in a Seat, a Rain issuing from a Lion, a Scholar in the robe of a World, and a Sultan between beauty and benevolence.\nWere it not for the wonders of Allah's making, those virtues would not have grown in flesh nor nerve.\nThis is a description that dispenses with naming and does not need nicknaming, as it is specific to our Master the Prince, the Master, the Supported King, the Patron of Blessings, Abu al-Abbas Ma'mun ibn Ma'mun Khwarazm Shah, client of the Commander of the Faithful - may Allah perpetuate his authority and guard his glory and place. It is pure for him excluding mankind, and gathering with him the beauties of the world. O Allah, just as You favored him over Your servants with virtues that cannot be counted and favors that cannot be forgotten, favor him with long life, continuous kingship, delivery of deed, comfortable living, calmness of heart, highness of hand, happiness of luck, sufficiency of the important, and removal of the distressing.

Regarding Metonymies (Kinayat) for what is reprehensible to mention, ugly to publish, or shy to name, or taken as bad omen, or elevated and protected from. With acceptable words that convey the meaning, articulate the intent, beautify the ugly, soften the dense, and clothe it in elegant exhibition. In addressing Kings, corresponding with the modest, discussing with people of virtue, and conversing with those of chivalry and wit. So the desire is obtained and success looms, with turning away from what the hearing recoils from and nature is not intimate with, to what stands in its place and substitutes for it, of speech the ear permits and the heart does not block. That is only from eloquence in souls, characteristics of rhetoric, results of skill, and subtleties of craft. I see myself not preceded in authoring its like, arranging its resemblance, and setting its jewels. From the Book of Allah, the news of the Prophet, peace be upon him, the speech of the predecessors, the necklaces of poets, the texts of the eloquent, and the anecdotes of the witty. In types of prose and verse, and arts of seriousness and jest. I had authored it in Nishapur in the year four hundred. The High Tongue - may Allah perpetuate his highness - mentioned it, and the Obeyed Command - may Allah perpetuate his elevation - issued to send a copy of it to the Populated Treasury - may Allah perpetuate its honor. I created it another creation, cast it a second time after the first, verified its categorization and arrangement, and excelled in its refinement and gilding. I titled it \"The Book of Metonymy and Allusion\" (Kitab al-Kinaya wa al-Ta'rid), and honored it with the High Name - may Allah establish it as long as days and nights last. I brought it out in seven chapters, each chapter containing several sections titled with their subjects.\n\"The First Chapter\" on Metonymy regarding Women and Harem, and what occurs with them and connects to their mention of all their affairs and conditions. Its sections are five.\n\"The Second Chapter\" on mentioning Boys and those who speak of them, and Metonymy regarding their descriptions and conditions. Its sections are five.\n\"The Third Chapter\" on Metonymy regarding some waste of food and the place prepared for it. Its sections are four.\n\"The Fourth Chapter\" on Metonymy regarding uglinesses and disabilities. Its sections are twelve.\n\"The Fifth Chapter\" on Metonymies regarding illness, greyness, old age, and death. Its sections are eight.\n\"The Sixth Chapter\" regarding what time and condition necessitate of Metonymy regarding food and drink and what connects to them, in two sections.\n\"The Seventh Chapter\" on various arts of Metonymy and Allusion, different in arrangement. Its sections are seven.\nHere I am opening its context and fulfilling its rights and conditions with the help of Allah Almighty and the state of our Master the King, the Master, the Patron of Blessings, Khwarazm Shah - may Allah establish it and perpetuate it.\n\n\"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\"\n\"Chapter One..

    "text": "The Arabs use metonymy for a woman with Ewe (Na'jah), Sheep (Shah), Young She-Camel (Qalus), Sarha Tree, Tillage (Harth), Bed (Firash), Threshold ('Atabah), Flask (Qarura), Basket (Qawsara), Sandal (Na'l), Shackle (Ghull), Fetter (Qayd), Shade (Zullah), and Neighbor (Jarah). Reports have come and poems have spoken with all of them.\n\"As for\" metonymy with Ewe, the Quran clarified it in the story of David, peace be upon him: \"Indeed this, my brother, has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe,\" meaning a woman.\n\"As for\" metonymy with Sheep, it is as Antara al-Absi said: \"O sheep, not hunted for one to whom she is lawful... Forbidden to her guardian, she was not forbidden.\" He used metonymy for a woman and said: What a prey you are for one for whom it is lawful to hunt you. As for me, the sanctity of neighborhood has forbidden you to me.\n\"As for\" metonymy with Young She-Camel, it is as a man from a raid he was in wrote to Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, advising him regarding his women: \"Lo, convey to Abu Hafs a message... May my trusted brother ransom you, my wrapper. Our young she-camels, may Allah guide you, we have been... Occupied from you (them) in the time of siege.\"\n\"As for\" metonymy with Sarha, which is a tree, it is as Humayd bin Thawr said: \"Allah refused except that the Sarha of Malik... Over all the branches of the 'Idah (thorny trees) pleases.\" He used metonymy for Malik's wife with Malik's Sarha, the best metonymy, and expressed her perfection in beauty over all women with the best expression. One who said (the following) followed his path in this metonymy: \"I have no sin against them that I knew... Except that I said: O Sarha, peace. Yes, then peace, then peace, then peace... Three greetings, even if you do not speak.\" Such metonymy occurs regarding one whom they do not dare to name or blame themselves for declaring her name, as the poet said: \"And I use metonymy for Qadhur with other than her... And I express clearly sometimes with her, so I declare.\"\n\"As for Tillage\", from it is the saying of the poet, casting it in the way of riddles: \"If locusts ate the tillages of a people... Then the eating of locusts saddened me with worry.\" He means by his tillage a woman. In the Quran: \"Your women are a tillage for you.\"\n\"As for Bed\", Allah Almighty said in describing Paradise: \"And beds (surur/women) raised.\" Meaning women. Do you not see Him saying after it: \"Indeed, We have produced them into a creation. And made them virgins.\"? It is narrated about some of them that he said to a man who wanted to marry: \"Thicken your bed,\" meaning choose the plump of women.\n\"As for\" the Threshold, it is in the story of Abraham, peace be upon him. He visited his son Ishmael, peace be upon him, so his presence coincided with his absence from the house. His wife came to him and informed him of his state, and did not offer him hospitality. He said to her: \"Say to my son that your father sends you peace and orders you to change your threshold.\" When Ishmael, peace be upon him, returned and the woman told him the story and delivered the message, he divorced her immediately in compliance with his father's command, because his saying \"Change your threshold\" is a metonymy for divorcing her and replacing her.\n\"As for\" metonymy with Flask, it is from the saying of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, to the driver of the camels on which were his wives: \"Gently with the flasks.\"\n\"As for metonymy\" with Basket (Qawsara), from it is the saying of the Rajiz poet: \"Successful is he who has a basket... He eats from it every day once.\"\n\"As for the Sandal\", from it is the saying of Umar, may Allah Almighty be pleased with him: \"The woman is a sandal the man wears if he wishes, not if she wishes.\"\n\"As for the Shackle\", from it is the saying of some wise men of the Arabs mentioning women: \"Among them is the loving, the fertile, the sitting. And among them is a shackle Allah places on the neck of whom He wills and unties from whom He wills.\"\n\"As for the Fetter\", from it is the saying of Abu al-Hasan al-Jawhari al-Jurjani from a poem regarding Al-Sahib, mentioning his preparation to march to his presence and using metonymy for divorcing his wife: \"My steed is before me and my tail tucked up... And my heart from longing comes and goes. I was hobbled by my family, fettered... And here I am from that hobble released.\" Mentioning divorce, I approve and find very witty what Ibn al-Amid wrote in metonymy for the oath of some kings by divorce, which is his saying in a section of a letter: \"He swore an oath in which he named his free women (wives).\"\n\"As for the Shade (Zullah)\", it is with some Kufans a wife, and with some metonymic. Likewise Al-Halilah (Wife). He recites: \"And I am in need of the death of my shade... But the chattel of evil remains, long-lived.\"\n\"As for the Neighbor\", Al-A'sha says in it: \"O our neighbor, leave, for you are divorced.\"\n\"Of the beneficence\" of Al-Mutanabbi, the famous, is his saying to Sayf al-Dawla when he attacked Banu Kilab and captured their women then returned them to them: \"If the Prince captured dogs (Kilab - pun on tribe name)... The fog prevented him from their suns.\"",

    "text": "He used metonymy for women with Suns, and for protection before them with Fog. The Arabs also use metonymy for women with Fawns (Ju'dhur), Gazelles (Ziba'), Oryx (Maha), and Cows (Baqar).\n\"Al-Nu'man\" bin al-Mundhir used this metonymy and his blood was in it. That is because he had wronged Zaid bin Adi when he killed his father Adi bin Zaid. Zaid was the translator of King Parviz. He used to wait for calamities for Al-Nu'man and seek disasters for him. When he knew the King's inclination to women, he described Al-Nu'man's daughters to him and advised him to propose to them, knowing his refusal to marry non-Arabs due to the pride in his soul. He sent a messenger to him for the proposal. Al-Nu'man said: \"Does not the King have sufficiency with the cows of Iraq from these black Bedouin women?\" Zaid translated this phrase into Persian, uglified the meaning, and worsened the presence. He said: \"He insults the King with the nickname Cows.\" Parviz ordered Al-Nu'man brought and thrown to the elephants, so they trampled him with their feet and finished him off.\nAmong what has no end to its beauty is the metonymy of the Prophet, peace be upon him, for the beautiful woman in the bad origin: \"Beware of the greenness of the dung (Khadra' al-Diman).\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymies for the Harem\"\n\"When\" Abu al-Hasan Khumarawayh bin Tulun, Governor of Egypt, transferred his daughter named Qatr al-Nada to Al-Mu'tadid, he wrote to him reminding him of the sanctity of her predecessor with his predecessor, describing what befalls her of the pomp of the Caliphate, the awe of the Sultan, and the loneliness of estrangement, asking him to comfort her, make her happy, and draw her near. The Vizier Ubayd Allah bin Sulayman wanted to answer the letter in his handwriting. He asked Ja'far bin Muhammad bin Thawabah to rely on him in the answer. He did so. Ja'far bin Muhammad wrote a letter in which he said in a section: \"As for the Trust (Wadi'ah) - may Allah strengthen you - she is in the status of what transferred from your left hand to your right hand, out of our stinginess with her, guarding of her, and observance of your affection in her.\" When he showed it to the Vizier Ubayd Allah, he was very pleased with it and said to him: \"Your metonymy for her with 'The Trust' is half of eloquence.\" He signed for him an increase in his stipends and fiefs.\n\"When it was\" the days of Izz al-Dawla bin Mu'izz al-Dawla, and he transferred his daughter to Umdat al-Dawla Abu Tha'lab al-Hamdani, Abu Ishaq al-Sabi wrote on his behalf to Abu Tha'lab a letter which the people of the craft approved and memorized this section from, for its inclusion of several subtle metonymies. Its copy: \"And Abu al-Najm Badr al-Harami has headed - and he is the trustee over what he observes, the loyal in what he guards - towards you, O my master and lord - may Allah perpetuate your glory - with the Trust. She has only transferred from a homeland to a dwelling, from a planting place to a wedding place, and from a shelter of nurture and kindness to a dwelling of dignity and favors. She is a piece of me obtained by you, and a fruit from the harvest of my heart separated to you. He has not separated from me who connected his rope to your rope, chose for him your brilliant virtue, settled him in the spacious home of your beautiful characteristics, and dwelled him in the vast protection of your noble nature and oddities. There is no loss upon what your trust contains and your maintenance encompasses.\"\nThe author of the book said: Ibn al-Amid, Al-Sahib, Al-Sabi, and Abd al-Aziz bin Yusuf - who are the eloquent of the age and unique ones of the time - often use metonymy for the daughter with 'The Noble One' (Karima), for the young girl with 'The Basil' (Rayhana), for the mother with 'The Free' (Hurra) and 'The Pious' (Barra), for the sister with 'The Full Sister' (Shaqiqa), for the wife with 'The Great of the House' (Kabirat al-Bayt), for the harem with 'Who is behind the curtain', and for the wedding with 'Uniting the gathering' and 'Connecting the rope'. If I wrote the sections containing these metonymies, the breath of the chapter would extend. In what I presented of these points is sufficiency.\n\"And told me\" Abu al-Nasr Muhammad bin Abd al-Jabbar al-Utbi. He said: When the mother of Emir Al-Radi Abu al-Qasim Nuh ibn Mansur died, my uncle Abu al-Nasr al-Utbi needed to correspond with the Presence for condolence for her. He did not approve of the word 'Mother' and 'Parent' in mentioning her. So he wrote a letter in a section of which he said: \"The effectiveness of Allah's decree regarding the one whose survival made the Inhabited House the ascent of accepted supplications and the descent of hoped-for blessings has knocked on ears.\" The scribes of the Presence approved it and memorized it.\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for the Private Part of the Woman\"\nAbu al-Qasim al-Rasuri recited to me for some Arabs:\n\"And if the noble wastes the request of his nose... Or his wife for a hateful thing, he does not get angry.\"\n\"The Arabs\" say that the fetus, when its days are complete in the womb and wants to exit from it, seeks with its nose the place from which it exits. Professor Abu Bakr al-Tabari said to me: Look how this poet was subtle in his deletion for the metonymy for the mother's vagina with his saying \"request of his nose\".\n\"The meaning\" of the verse is that a man, when he does not protect the vagina of his mother or his wife, does not get angry at anything done to him after that.\nAl-Sahib said in his treatise titled 'Alerting to the faults of Al-Mutanabbi's poetry': Poets used to describe wrappers (Ma'azir) and use them as metonymy for what is behind them, purifying their words from what is hideous to mention, until this naturally gifted poet stepped to declaration which no one else was guided to. He said: \"I, despite my fondness for what is in her veil... Am chaste from what is in her trousers.\"",

    "text": "Much fornication is better than this chastity.\n\"Among what\" is approved for Al-Hajjaj is his saying to the mother of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath: \"You intended the money of Allah and placed it under your tail,\" because he hated to say \"under your butt\" as the commoners say, fearing he might have risked, as Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr was faulted when he said to the wife of Abdullah bin Hazim: \"Bring out the money that is under your butt.\" She said: \"I did not think anyone took charge of anything of Muslims' affairs and would speak with this.\" Some of those present said: \"Do you not see the hidden divorce (Khul') she alluded to?\"\n\"Abu Mansur al-Azhari said\" regarding the Prophet's prohibition, peace be upon him, of approaching women in their \"Mahash\" (places of collection/backsides), that it is a metonymy for their anuses, and its origin is from \"Hash\" (garden/privy).\n\"Al-Jahiz said\" regarding the saying of Allah, Great and Glorious is His Name: \"And those who guard their private parts (Furuj).\" And His saying: \"And Maryam, the daughter of Imran, who guarded her private part (Farj),\" that it is a metonymy for the Awrah (private part). When it became frequent in speech, some commentators said it needs a metonymy. So he said regarding His saying Almighty: \"And they said to their skins: Why did you testify against us?\" that it is a metonymy for private parts. As if he did not know that the skin speaking is the most wondrous wonder. Had it been so, He would have said when mentioning private parts: \"And those who guard their skins,\" and would have said: \"And Maryam, the daughter of Imran, who guarded her skin.\"\n\"The Jurists narrated\" that Rifa'a divorced his wife, and she married a man called Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Zubayr - with Fatha on Zay and Kasra on Ba - then she complained of him to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and said: \"What is with him is like the fringe of a garment.\" The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"Do you want to return to Rifa'a? No, until you taste his little honey ('Usaylah) and he tastes your little honey.\" Look at the subtlety of this speech, its abundant luster, and its beautiful metonymy for the private part and intercourse with 'Usaylah, which is the diminutive of 'Asal (Honey). It is masculine and feminine. Those who denied its femininity went to say it is the diminutive of 'Asalah (a portion of honey). It is said 'Asalah and 'Asal, just as Tamrah (a date) and Tamr (dates) are said.\n\"Of the rare\" metonymy and its good ones is the saying of Abu Hakima Rashid bin Ishaq the Scribe in his art for which he was famous, from a poem: \"Then, there is no good with you to be hoped... O penis of little benefit. Long did you knock down the knights of war... And conquered the impregnable fortress. And stormed the Matamir (dungeons/silos) of passion... So you knew the narrow of them and the wide.\" My pledge with Professor Al-Tabari is reciting these verses and wondering at their quality in their meaning, saying: Indeed, he who uses metonymy for vaginas and anuses with \"Matamir of passion\" is of the devils of humans for whom speech was subjugated until they led it with the softest rein.\n\"Related\" to this section is the saying of Al-Buhturi regarding a man who married a songstress: \"He married her after her burning... The hearts of drinking companions and disturbing them. So how did you expand and not contract... To sit her with her lovers? If you enable (access to) her love... Then you enable (access to) her leg.\"\n\n\"Section connected to it on Metonymy for the Man's Private Part\"\nThe Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"Whoever asserts his lineage with the assertion of Jahiliyyah (tribalism), tell him to bite his father's member (Henn), and do not use metonymy.\"\nAnd he, peace be upon him, said: \"Whoever Allah protects from the evil of what is between his jaws and his legs enters Paradise.\"\nThe poet said in the likeness of these two metonymies: \"And two members of the human have no bone in them... They are the cause of his reform and his corruption. If they are sound, soundness is with them... And if they corrupt, he does not succeed on the day of his return.\"\nAbd al-Aziz bin Muhammad al-Susi used metonymy for it with \"Bulbulah\" (spout/nightingale). He said from a poem: \"And when she stood on my Bulbulah... And I did not find a trick, I was confused (Tabalbalt).\"\nMetonymy is used for the skin of 'Umayrah and 'Umayrah, as well as the Rod (Qadib) and the Scroll (Tumar).\nAbu Nu'ama said: \"I visited your brother, O Banu Salih... And he ceased not spreading a scroll (Tumar). Until when it roughened in his palm... He entered it into the mouse trap.\"\n\"Di'bil said\": \"O you who turns a scroll and spreads it... What is in your heart of the love of scrolls? In it is a resemblance of something you were tasked with... Length for length and roundness for roundness.\"\nAmong Ibn al-Rumi's metonymies in this chapter is his saying satirizing a person: \"No day and night passed on him... Except part of his boy was in part of him.\"\n\"Abu al-Fath al-Busti recited to me for himself\": \"And a possessor of coquetry, when I observed her form...

    "text": "He was witty in combining the two Nuns, and clever in using metonymy for his ware with \"Imam of Amusement\" and for its curvature and lack of erection with \"reading Surat Al-Nun.\" He only compared it to the known Surat Al-Nun (shaped like a hook/arch). \"Jinan al-Madaniyya\" used to use metonymy for the man's ware with \"Key of Pleasure.\" In the book \"Mulah al-Nawadir,\" a man solicited a virgin woman for her virginity. She said: \"This is the Seal of Allah.\" He said, pointing to his ware: \"And this is the Key of Allah.\"\n\"Of the good\" metonymies in this chapter: \"So-and-so is chaste of wrapper (Izar)\" and \"So-and-so is pure of tail (Dhayl)\" if he is chaste of private parts. \"I said\" in the book \"Al-Mubhij\": \"Whoever's wrapper is chaste, his burdens (sins) are light.\" Metonymy with the wrapper is used for what is behind it, as an Arab woman said: \"Those descending in every battlefield... And the good in the knots of wrappers.\" How excellent are Ziyadah bin Zaid's metonymies for chastity of the private part and nobility of marriage in his saying: \"When we reached the mothers, you found... Your cousins were noble of bedfellows.\"\n\n\"Section\" on Metonymy for what occurs between men and women of following desire, seeking pleasure, and seeking offspring.\nThere is nothing better, more beautiful, nor subtler than Allah's metonymy for that in His saying: \"And one of you has entrusted (conveyed) to the other.\" And His saying, Exalted is His mention: \"When he covered her.\" And His saying: \"They are clothing for you and you are clothing for them.\" And His saying: \"So now bashiruhunna (have relations with them) and seek what Allah has prescribed for you.\" And His saying: \"So come to your tillage however you wish.\" And His saying: \"So whatever you enjoyed of it from them.\" And His saying in metonymy for seeking that, narrating about Joseph, peace be upon him: \"She solicited me for myself.\" So Glory be to Allah! How His speech gathers beauties and subtleties, and how manifest is the trace of inimitability upon its brevity and expansion in its meaning and wording.\n\"Among\" what came of good metonymy for marriage (Nikah) in Pre-Islamic poetry is the saying of Al-A'sha: \"And every day you undertake a raid... To its farthest you tie the resolve of your determinations. Inheriting wealth and in the tribe highness... For what was lost in it of the Quru' (menstruation/purity periods) of your women.\" The Quru' here are the purity periods, because the praised one, since he raided much and did not cover (visit) the women due to absence from them in his raids, wasted their purity periods. \"Critics\" of poetry claimed that this metonymy is subtle, indicating the poet's skill in his craft. \"In my view,\" the wasting of the purity periods of kings' women is not something they are addressed with. Likewise the saying of Al-Akhtal regarding Banu Marwan: \"A people who, when they fight, tie their wrappers... Away from women, even if they spent the night in purities.\" For despite its beauty, it is of the superfluous speech which, had he been gifted the virtue of silence regarding it, he would have possessed virtue. What business does a poet have mentioning the harems of kings, let alone what happens to them with them?\nAs for the saying of Al-Rabi' bin Ziyad: \"Is it after the killing of Malik bin Zuhayr... Women hope for the consequences of purities?\" It is also a metonymy for intercourse after purity. He says: Do they hope to bear his like in his honor and generosity? The Arabs claim that a woman is most likely to conceive after the man has intercourse with her shortly after her purity from her menstruation, so pregnancy is the consequence of purity.\nIt is narrated that Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, heard one night while patrolling a woman singing these two verses: \"This night has lengthened and its side blackened... And it kept me awake that I have no friend to play with. By Allah, were it not for nothing but Him... The sides of this bed would have shaken.\" He asked about her and was told she is a woman whose husband is absent, gone out in some expeditions. He ordered him returned to her. \"Shaking of the bed\" is a metonymy for chaste copulation.\n\"Similar\" to it is the saying of Abu Uthman al-Khalidi from ??: \"And when the night restrained every watcher and blamer... The mattresses creaked beneath a people the creaking of litters.\"\nAmong the metonymies for intercourse is \"Al-Halj\" (Ginning/Rolling). Abu Nuwas used it in his saying: \"Then I sat on her back... As if I were a bird on a tower. And there was play from us for an hour... And the ginner pushed into ginning.\"\nFor Judge Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Abd al-Aziz al-Jurjani from a poem of jest and banter: \"You spend the night ginning the length of the night shrinking... And by choice calling out: Overtake the drowning. And Amr stood so I secured him the palm of a hand... When he bent or sipped the broth from them. If he made it die like the spear and it widened... Like the shield, a waterskin agreed then with a cover.\"\nOf Al-Buhturi's witticisms in this metonymy is his saying: \"He did not step out the door of the vestibule leaving... Except her anklet was with the earring.\" It is stolen from the saying of another: \"Be gentle a little, you have hurt me... And stuck my earring to my anklets.\"\nProfessor Abu Bakr al-Tabari took this metonymy and added to it where he said: \"And the matter is in your thinking the beautiful thought of her... And long did her legs hurt my shoulder. And look at her heel, you will see scars on it... From the length of what her earrings scratched the two heels.\"",

    "text": "He also said: \"Like one stealing glances at a bride... While with other than him the anklets shake.\"\n\"Al-Suli recounted\" about Al-Muktafi in a conversation of his, he said: \"I stayed up last night, so I remembered some medicines of sleeplessness, so I became intimate and slept.\" He said: We said to him: \"By Allah, we have never heard a better metonymy than this.\" He said: \"By Allah, I never heard it before this time of mine, but the expression drove it.\" \"Medicine of sleeplessness\" is a metonymy for intercourse and for drunkenness.\n\"It reached me\" about Ibn Umar the Judge that he would not sit for disputants until he attained from food and drink and visited his family, as a precaution for his religion and chastity with the lawful from what his soul might yearn for of the unlawful if a glance escaped him towards one of the beautiful women who might seek judgment from him.\n\"I read\" by Abu Ishaq al-Sabi a section in this exact meaning from a Sultanic appointment letter to some judges. I wondered at the beauty of his expression and the subtlety of his metonymy, which is: \"And he ordered him to sit for disputants having attained from food and drink a portion by which he stops at the beginning of sufficiency and does not reach with it to the last end. And to expose himself to all causes of need and all accidents of humanity, lest a visitor visit him or a circumambulator circle him, so they divert him from his guidance and come between him and his correctness.\"\nThis is a copy of a note by Al-Sahib in banter containing good metonymies from this chapter: \"The news of my master - may Allah perpetuate his glory - even if he hid it from me and kept it to himself without me, is preserved with me. I have known that in his drinking and intimacy, and the singing of the knocking guest and his wedding. And there was what was of what I do not mention, and happened so happened of what I do not publish. I say that my master mounted the grey (horse), so how did he find its back? And rode the flyer, so how did he witness its war? And was he safe on the roughness of the road? And how did he act, in wideness or tightness? And did he perform Hajj alone? And he said in summary with dislike: Let him be kind to define the news to me. Denial does not benefit him, and nothing avails him but confession. I hope that Sheikh Abu Murrah helps us as he helped him once, so we pray to the Qibla he prayed to, and enable ourselves from the degree he preached upon. This, while he has the virtue of precedence to that field of many knights.\"\n\"Fitting\" for this section is a section mentioned by Al-Azhari in the book \"Tahdhib al-Lugha.\" He said: If a man comes to a woman in other than her place (of intercourse), it is said \"Hammad Tahmidan\" (soured/acidified), shifted from place to place. The \"Khullah\" is what was sweet, and the \"Hamd\" is its fruit. It is said \"Ahmada al-Qawm Ihmadan\" if they poured forth into what comforts them of speech and humor. \"It is narrated\" from Sa'id bin Yasar that he said to Ibn Umar: \"What do you say about Tahmid (souring/acidification)?\" He said: \"And what is Tahmid?\" He said: \"That a man comes to a woman in her anus.\" He said: \"Does a Muslim do that?\"\n\"Other than Al-Azhari said\" regarding metonymy for the slave girl desired for that, their saying: \"She is Malikite,\" because of what is narrated from Malik bin Anas regarding the permissibility of that.\n\"Among\" what is deemed witty by Abu Ishaq al-Sabi is his saying: \"She spent the night, and every protected thing... To me from her sanctuary was permissible. In a night nothing faulted it... By Allah, except the morning.\"\n\n\"Section on Deflowering Virginity\"\nOf the quaint metonymy for taking virginity is what I read in the news of Bashar bin Burd when Yazid bin Mansur said in the house of Al-Mahdi: \"O Sheikh, what is your craft?\" He said: \"Piercing pearls.\" I see Al-Sahib took from his saying to Abu al-Ala al-Asadi when he consummated his marriage, from verses: \"Two days of our month have passed... So tell us, has the pearl been pierced?\" And to him he also says: \"My heart is on embers, O Abu al-Ala... So have you opened the locked place? And have you broken the seal from the bag... And have you applied kohl to the cross-eyed observer?\"\nFor Ibn al-Amid in this meaning to Abu al-Hasan bin Hindu: \"Good morning, Abu Hasan... And increase in joy with your wife. You have tamed your filly in seclusion... So have you borrowed her recalcitrance? And you knocked on a locked (door), so has... The God facilitated an opening for it?\"\nAbu al-Fadl al-Mikali recited to me for himself in banter he had among his family: \"Abu Ja'far, have you broken the shell... And have you, when you shot, hit the target? And have you traversed a night without shyness... For the horror of the night journey, darkness in darkness?\"\nI think the predecessor in describing deflowering is Hammad Ajrad where he said and did well: \"We have opened the fortress after refusal... With a permitter, opener of castles, I won. Suffice with separation of a reunion... Its separation came to us with a meeting. So if my split and the split of my beloved... Are only healed after a crack.\"\nNot cold is the saying of Al-Ya'qubi: \"And my concern since I was in the untying of waistbands... And piercing the sphere ceased not to amaze me.\" And the saying of Abu Abdullah bin al-Hajjaj: \"All my property is charity... I will surely break the pistachio. I must stab with the... Spear the core of the shield.",

    "text": "And I extend the needle into... The hollow of the pupil's blackness. It must be that the two buttons fall... In the middle of the ring.\"\nOf the famous that occurs in this section is what is narrated that Ibn al-Qariyah said to Al-Hajjaj when he consummated with some of his virgin wives: \"With prosperity (Yemen/Right hand), blessing, intensity of movement, and victory in the battle.\"\nOf the witticisms of metonymy for the virgin is the saying of some: \"They said: You loved a young one. So I answered them... The most desirable of mounts is what has not been ridden. How much difference between a pierced pearl... That was worn, and a pearl not pierced.\" This was contradicted by one who said: \"Indeed the mount, riding it is not pleasant... Until it is humbled by the rein and ridden. And the pearl is not beneficial to its owners... Until it is treated with strings and pierced.\"\nOf the good metonymy for her is their saying: \"So-and-so is with the seal of her Lord.\"\n\"It is narrated\" that an old Arab man married a virgin but was unable to deflower her. When morning came, she was asked about her condition. She recited a verse than which nothing is more indicative of the inability to take virginity: \"The mounts spend the night confused about the guidance... If the mounts do not find one to set them straight.\"\nOf the obscure in this chapter is the saying of the poet to Abu al-Mudabbir: \"Your father wanted your mother when she was wed... But Bint Sa'd was not found for your mother.\" He means virginity was not found for her. Bint Sa'd is 'Udhrah (Virginity/Excuse) bint Ka'b.\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Menstruation\"\nSome commentators said regarding the saying of Allah Almighty: \"So she laughed (Dhahikat)\" that it is a metonymy for menstruation. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said in what he dispraised of women: \"They are deficient in intellect and religion.\" Then he said: \"One of them leaves prayer for half her life,\" using metonymy for menstruation.\n\"Sahl bin al-Marzuban told me\" said: I used to attend sometimes in Baghdad the gathering of 'Anan the songstress. The virtuous used to frequent her often for superior listening. She used to begin with the Quran seeking blessing by opening with it, and she would excel greatly, then she would take to her affair. While I was with her one day, behold she began with poetry. The voices of those present rose demanding the return of her habit in beginning with the Quran, while she was silent. When they repeated it times, the owner of the curtain said to them: \"It is not permissible for her to read the Quran.\" Most of them did not catch this metonymy until he alerted them that he used metonymy for her menstruation.\n\"It is told\" that Buran bint al-Hasan bin Sahl, when she was wed to Al-Ma'mun, menstruated out of the awe of the Caliphate at other than the time of menstruation. When Al-Ma'mun was alone with her and extended his hand to her waistband, she recited: \"The command of Allah comes, so do not hasten it.\" He understood her state and wondered at her metonymy and increased in admiration for her. \"How similar\" his understanding of her metonymy is to the state of Abu Firas al-Hamdani where he said: \"The messenger used metonymy for the answer as a novelty... And if he used metonymy, indeed we knew what he meant.\"\nI was reading in the poetry of Ibn al-Hajjaj \"And the Prince is Muftasid (being bled)\" in a verse where there is no room for the meaning of the Prince's bleeding. I did not understand it until some masters mentioned to me that it is a metonymy for menstruation in the tongue of the jesters of Baghdad. So the meaning of the verse became clear to me. Were it not for its excessive obscenity, I would have cited it. Then I was recited what verifies its meaning by some contemporaries: \"I walked on my blood and rode a terror... At a risk the march was serious with it. To one between whose two garments are wishes... And in her buttons is the illuminating moon. So when I sought union from her... She was veiled and it was said: The Prince has been bled. So oh you, then oh you, what a bleeder... By whom a great Hajj was hindered for me.\"\n\n\"Section on Pregnancy\"\nMujahid regarding the saying of Allah Almighty: \"So she passed with it,\" said it is a metonymy for pregnancy. This metonymy often runs in Persian.\nHow excellent is what Al-Farazdaq used as metonymy for a pregnant slave girl of his who died, in his saying: \"And a scabbard of a weapon I was afflicted with, so I did not wail... Over it, nor did I send the weeping women over it. And in its hollow was a sharp sword possessor of resentment... If deaths had delayed it for nights.\"\n\"I heard\" Abu al-Fadl Abdullah bin Ahmad al-Mikali in discussion say: The Arabs say in inquiring about the pregnant woman and using metonymy for her giving birth: \"Did your she-camel give milk (Ahlabat) or did she bring noisy crowd (Ajlabat)?\" Meaning: Did she come with a female so she gives milk, or with a male so he brings noise (Jalab) for sale?\n\"I read\" in the book \"Jirab al-Dawla\" that a whore said to a lesbian: \"How good is the banana!\" using metonymy for the penis. She said: \"Yes, but it bloats the belly,\" using metonymy for pregnancy.\n\n\"Section on Anecdotes and Witticisms in Metonymies of this Chapter\"\nHere are famous disputed verses attributed to a group of slave girls and boys. Among them is a songstress whom a friend of hers saw, and due to what she had, he found the width rough and was hurt by the hair, so he turned away from her and abandoned her. Then she fixed her affair and wrote to him saying: \"May I be your ransom! I smoothed the road in which... Your steed complained of barefootedness due to its roughness. So it became after sadness a field of pleasure... In which the bay horse of desire roams for his pleasure.",

    "text": "If you are resolved to visit us... Then hasten and hurry, for the crescent is a son of its night (new).\"\nFrom the metonymy of the jesters of Baghdad for that state is \"In the mouth of the bottle is fiber (Lif).\" Ibn al-Hajjaj said: \"I yearn when I see the p---y at night... Beside me, plucked and clean. And I do not loathe it if it comes one day... And in its mouth and top of the head is fiber. If the lamb is scalded, I eat from it... And I do not loathe it while wool is on it.\"\n\"It is told\" that Al-Walid bin Yazid wanted a woman from Quraysh for what is done with slave girls. She said: \"Rising, O Commander of the Faithful, rising... I am not as you are accustomed to from slave girls.\"\n\"It is told\" that one of the Chosroes went out hunting and was separated from his companions. Behold, an old Sheikh working in a land of his. He said to him: \"O Sheikh, why did you not set out early (Adlajta - marry young?) so there would be those to suffice you?\" He said: \"I set out early but lost the way.\" He said to him: \"Zah (Bravo/Alas).\" When his companions caught up with the King, he gave the Sheikh four thousand dirhams. \"He meant\": Why did you not marry when you were young so there would be today those to suffice you from your children? His saying \"I lost the way\" bears two meanings: one is that he did not marry a young fertile woman, and the other is that he did not follow what Allah wrote for him.\n\"Al-Mazini recounted\" said: Witty women sat with Bashar bin Burd. He spoke and they spoke. Then they said to him: \"We wish you were our father.\" He said: \"On condition that I am on the religion of Kisra (Chosroes - meaning marrying daughters).\"\n\"I heard\" Abu Nasr Sahl bin al-Marzuban say in discussion: Some of the women whom Umar bin Abdullah bin Abi Rabi'a used to flirt with were asked about her state with him. She said: \"May Allah curse that sinner. He gathered me and him at place such-and-such for a seclusion of such-and-such. So I settled from him in a valley without cultivation,\" using metonymy for his impotence in intercourse.\n\"When Abu al-Samt\", who knew poetry better, said to Ali bin al-Jahm: \"By your life, Jahm bin Badr is not a poet... And this Ali after him claims poetry. But my father was a neighbor to his mother... So when he claimed poetry, he made me imagine a matter.\" People found this metonymy witty, and the two verses traveled every path. Ali said: \"By Allah, he is not the father of the virginity (inventor) of this meaning. Rather, he wove on the loom of what passed between Al-Farazdaq and Kuthayyir.\" He was asked about that. He said: \"It reached me that Kuthayyir recited a poem of his which the listeners approved, and among them was Al-Farazdaq. Kuthayyir said: O Abu Dahuk, did your mother used to visit Basra? He said: No, O Abu Firas, but my father often visited it.\"\n\"Of\" the malicious satire containing declaration is the saying of Abu al-Hasan bin Tabataba al-Alawi to Abu Ali bin Rustam, and his wife was accused with Adharyun his boy: \"O Rustami, you have played with a pool... Whose beauty you became protecting and guarding. And the wife is playing in her pool to which... The water flows, Adharyun (pun on name/penis? or flow).\"\n\"A man was asked\" about a woman. He said: \"In her are two qualities of the qualities of Paradise,\" using metonymy for coldness and width.\n\"Abu Sa'd Nasr bin Ya'qub told me\" said: A stranger in Baghdad sought a beautiful woman to marry. A brokeress (Dallalah) said to him: \"I have here a woman like a bouquet of narcissus.\" He proposed to her and married her. When he consummated with her, behold she was an ugly old woman. He called the brokeress and rebuked her for her lie. She said: \"I did not lie to you when I said 'like a bouquet of narcissus'. I only used metonymy for the yellowness of her face, the whiteness of her hair, and the greenness of her leg.\"\n\"Of the rare\" metonymy for the woman betraying her husband's bed is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi: \"And it is said to Abu Ali al-Basir: You, O Sheikh, are asleep, so wake up... And take my advice, for I am not of your cheaters. You have a female strutting in every nest... And raising chicks in your nests.\"\nThe commoners use metonymy for resuming the lover and returning to connection after the occurrence of a period and the happening of forgetfulness with \"Heating the Rice,\" as some wrote to a lover of his: \"I was alone with your memory when was absent from me... A watcher whom I used to fear of old. And the resting place cooled, may my soul be your ransom... And heating the rice is good in it.\" \"Another said\": \"And I do not like rice at its first cooking... So how do I like rice when it is heated?\"\n\nChapter Two: On Mentioning Boys and Males, and those who speak of them \"Metonymy regarding their descriptions and conditions\"\n\"Section on Puberty and Circumcision\"\nCircumcision is metonymized by 'Tuhr' (Purification) and 'Tatahhur'. Of the wittiest I heard in that is the saying of Al-Sanawbari: \"I see a purification that will bear fruit after a wedding... Just as joy bears the fruit of wine. And a pen does not avail you except... If you meet from it like the paring (Qulamah).\" My wonder at the beauty of this metonymy and the pleasantness of this representation does not end, just as my admiration does not end for the saying of Abu Ibrahim Ismail bin Ahmad al-Amiri al-Shashi from a poem praising Fakhr al-Dawla and using metonymy for the circumcision of his two sons with the best metonymy. I do not think anyone addressed a king in his meaning with better and more creative than it:",

    "text": "\"You touched your cub in the right of guidance with pain... Were it not for piety, we would have shed a thousand bloods for it. You polished a sword so the brave rejoices, and... You pruned a branch so the stature of the breeze grows.\"\nJust as I do not think anyone used metonymy for the puberty (wet dream) of a boy better than the saying of Ibrahim bin al-Abbas regarding Al-Muntasir, who was then the Crown Prince: \"This is the crescent of the covenant, it has... Become a full moon with Al-Muntasir. Crown Prince of people and son of... The Imam of humans. O night we count... It passed for us from smallness. It showed a crescent and cleared... With its cloud about a moon.\"\n\"Among what\" foreskin is metonymized with is the saying of Di'bil: \"Our disobedience to Allah ceased not to ruin us... Until it pushed us to Fath and Dinar. To two uncircumcised ones (Ulaijayn) whose fruits were not cut... For long have they prostrated to the sun and fire.\"\n\"Of the witty\" metonymy for it is what Abu Sa'id bin Duwayst said regarding a boy accused of being Magian (Zoroastrian): \"I wondered at your beauty, O jeweller... And at the disgraces of your objectionable deed. You leave what is peeled of our beans... You swallow the beans while not peeled.\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for the Boy\" who is played with, and describing his skill and other attributes.\nHe is metonymized by 'Al-'Alaq' (Precious thing/Attachment), 'Al-Matbu'' (Natural/Stamp-able?), 'Al-Mu'ashir' (Associate), and 'Al-Muwasi' (Consoler). \"And it is said\": So-and-so answers the compelled if he calls him, which is of the disliked quotation I alerted to in the book \"Quoting from the Quran.\" And So-and-so is \"Min al-Bab\" (Of the Door/Category), as Ibn Tabataba said: \"We have a friend 'Min al-Bab' (of the type)... He stirs for the wandering lover his joys.\" And So-and-so is \"Min Shart\" (Of the police/condition of) Yahya bin Aktham, as Professor Al-Tabari said: \"A leg circulates it, our eyes circulate... On his eye, from the 'Shart' of Yahya bin Aktham.\" Yahya bin Aktham is famous for sodomy.\n\"Judge Ali bin Abd al-Aziz excelled\" in metonymy for the condition of sodomites by his saying from a poem he wrote to Abu al-Qasim Ali bin Muhammad al-Karkhi: \"If he has forgotten and turned him away from me... The suckling of the cup or a nurtured fawn. Souls empower him over their desire... And hearts give him their reins. With sides for which sins are permitted... And glances for which faults are lawful. So I have a burning liver and a heart... Over what is in it of sadness, joyful.\"\nOf Abu Nuwas's witticisms in this meaning is his saying: \"He passed by us while eyes watched him... Wounding in him the places of kisses. He was cast in the mold of beauty so he... Is not fit except for 'That Work'.\"\nFor Abu Sa'id Duwayst in mentioning 'That Work': \"I became attached to him, an attachment like camel meat... And this spring is the time of pregnancy (Haml - also carrying). So I saw you, my master, in other than it... When we became active for 'That Work'.\"\nMentioning 'That Work', Abu al-Hasan bin Faris recited for a man in Shiraz known as Al-Hamdani, admonishing a man of its scribes for attending a food from which he got sick: \"May you be protected from destruction and the vicissitudes of ailments... And may your feet not know slipping. Glory complained of illness when you fell ill... So you did not rise sound, recovering. The sin is yours, no blame except on you... Why did you eat the food of the low? Food that equals the selling of Nabidh... And is fit from the root of 'That Work'.\"\n\"Of the metonymies\" of the Sufis in this chapter is their saying for the handsome boy \"Shahid\" (Witness). Their meaning in it is that they, due to the beauty of his form, are a witness to the power of Allah, Exalted is His Name, over what He wills. \"It is told\" that the companions of Abu Ali al-Thaqafi avoided the word \"Shahid\" in his presence out of awe for him. So they agreed among themselves to say for the handsome boy \"Hujjah\" (Proof). It happened that they accompanied him on some road, and a boy appeared to them from afar. One of them said \"Hujjah\", thinking that Abu Ali would not notice his intent. When the boy drew near them, he was not handsome. Abu Ali turned to them and said: \"Dahid\" (Refuted/Slippery).\n\"I heard\" some jurists attribute this story to Abu Ishaq al-Marwazi. Its parallel is what is narrated that youths walked with Ibn al-Munkadir. Whenever they saw a beautiful woman, they said among themselves: \"We have seen lightning (Abraqna).\" They thought Ibn al-Munkadir would not notice their intent. They saw a covered dome. One of them said: \"Bariqa\" (Lightning). The cover of the dome was revealed from an ugly woman. Ibn al-Munkadir said: \"O brother, this is a thunderbolt (Sa'iqa).\"\n\"Of the pleasant\" metonymy for the effeminate boy is the saying of Sa'id bin Humayd: \"Do you not see a drizzle pouring... And this is your shouting facing? And this is the wine, and the dark-eyed fawn has startled us... With his appearance. So hasten with him and with us a drunkenness...

    "text": "I was recited for Al-Hasan al-Marwazi the Blind regarding a Christian boy: \"I do not forget, I do not forget the fawn of the church... Wanting the church from his house. O beauty of what is above his buttons... And O goodness of what is under his belt (Zunnar).\"\nAl-Sari al-Mawsili wrote to a friend of his, Surayyah, on the Day of Doubt, describing what he had of amusements: \"On the morning of Doubt we invite you... To the wine, take it early. And I have a songstress who gives you... The pearls of speech from her mouth. If she tickles the Oud... You think it is conversing with her. And wine crowned with perfume... From the breaths of its cupbearer. And roses like the cheeks of soft girls... Imitating it and it imitating them. And an 'Alaq' (boy) carrying the banner... We do not cheat nor camouflage.\"\n\"For Al-Sahib\": \"Indeed Ibn Masrur is a scribing youth... Taking a pen from every friend. Beautiful of appearance, possessor of a sign... Among the most skillful people in carrying the flag.\"\nFor some contemporaries from the people of Nishapur: \"I sent in describing a friend of ours... A truth written with gold. In beauty a peacock, but he is... More prostrating in seclusion than a hoopoe.\"\nI have not heard better or more innovative than the saying of Abu al-Hasan al-Jawhari al-Jurjani to some notables, seeking means to him by his service in his boyhood, and using metonymy for the meaning with the subtlest metonymy: \"Lo, O elevated King... Grant me of your abundant gifts. Your slave has a sanctity, and mentioning (it) is obscene... So do not necessitate mentioning the means.\"\nOf what is deemed salty for Al-Matrani al-Bashi is what he wrote to a friend of his whom he saw having a boy: \"I saw a fawn circling in your sanctuary... Singing, familiar with your generosity. It made me covet regarding him that he is a fawn... Bribing to cover, and is not of your servants. So occupy him for an hour when... His inkwell is empty, if you see, from your pen.\"\nOf the pleasant metonymy for the handsome, not bulky boy is the saying of Al-Jammaz: \"This fawn of yours, his face is beautiful... And what is other than that is all faulted. So understand my speech, O my brother, a sentence... The address does not resemble what is in the book.\"\nAnd for another in his meaning, granted to me: \"O Sahl, a witty one... His enchanting glances tempt me. Whatever you wish of world (Dunya), but he is... A hypocrite, you do not have his Hereafter (Akhirah - pun on rear).\"\nIn similar to that, wits said in prose: \"There is nothing behind Abadan but wood.\" Abu Nasr bin al-Marzuban put it into verse and said: \"O gazelle whose face... Like the full moon reveals darknesses. I tasted from his mouth and from... His kiss the water of life. I have nothing after Abadan... Except the wood.\"\nI heard some commoners say in Persian describing a boy taking from his rear and spending on his front: \"So-and-so melts the tail-fat on the fat.\" Then I heard some commoners say in that: \"So-and-so spends from his basin on his pitcher.\"\n\"It reached me\" that the postmasters in Nishapur wrote to the Presence in Bukhara reporting what occurred between some Sheikhs there and one of the Turkish commanders. He said in recounting that: \"And he said to him: O Mu'ajir (rented one/prostitute).\" When the Vizier of the time looked at this word, he disapproved of it and considered it great, and dismissed the postmaster from his job. When he arrived in Bukhara and got into his council, he scolded him for that slip and rebuked him, saying: \"Why did you not protect the Sultan's presence from such a dirty word?\" He said: \"May Allah support the majestic Sheikh, what should I write then, when I was ordered to report news as they are?\" He said: \"Were you unable, woe to you, to use metonymy for it and say: He cursed him with what youths are cursed with, or words conveying its meaning?\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for what is taken from them\"\nAl-Mubarrad recounted saying: Sulayman bin Wahb used to write for Musa bin Bugha and loved a slave of Musa, seeing the world in him. Musa went out one day hunting, and with him was Abu al-Khattab the Scribe. A matter came upon him in which he needed Sulayman, so he ordered him summoned. Abu al-Khattab said to that boy: \"Hasten to Sulayman and bring him.\" So he galloped to him. When he got before him, Sulayman was gentle with him until he attained what he loved from him, and rose with him to Musa's hunting place and obeyed his command. The next day, Abu al-Khattab wrote to him: \"There is no good with me in the friend... Who sleeps while the friend (Khalil) is awake. A saying of non-ingratitude from one who saw... For every majestic favor. Will you thank me in the morning... For my gentleness for you regarding the messenger? When we were in the hunting of mountains... And you were in the hunting of plains.\"\nThe like of this metonymy is better than the metonymy of Ibn al-Rumi in his saying: \"Is a handsome one preventing me my need... Whose character is hatred and obstinacy? For my need for him is only... The need of a rooster for a hen.\"",

    "text": "Verses by Ibn al-Mu'tazz passed in the utmost pleasantness, the last verse of which includes a very witty metonymy, which is: \"And a fawn who corrupted my heart... After the goodness of its repentance. He was generous with the army of beauty in... His numbers and equipment. So repentance died when... He appeared with his awe. And Iblis came congratulating... My looking at his countenance. And he ceased not reminding me... Of my Lord and the pardon of His power. And said to me: What is a kiss... And other than it in His mercy?\"\nMentioning the kiss, verses by Yunus al-Arudi were recited to me containing a subtle metonymy for what follows the kiss, which are: \"I am, from your love O my master... In a terrifying, difficult plan. And you have permitted a kiss today... Observing in it the sanctity of companionship. As if I, when I attained it as a gap... Kissed the corner of the House (Kaaba) of the veil. And since I won kissing the Corner... How can I enter the Kaaba?\"\nOf the witty metonymy for the kiss is what Abu al-Fadl Abdullah bin Ahmad al-Mikali recited to me for Abdullah bin al-Najm: \"Complaining to you of what... The skin found of treachery in you. Bewildered, if you wished, guided... Thirsty, if you wished, arrived (at water).\"\nOf the good metonymy for turning away from contact with women to thigthing with boys is the saying of some: \"I do not ride the sea, but I... Seek Allah's provision on the coast.\"\nThe most innovative I heard in the meaning of Tightness and Width with the best metonymy and gentlest expression is what Abu Nasr Ahmad bin Akrid al-Zanjani recited to me for himself regarding his boy Yusuf: \"Yusuf went from us with ninety dirhams... And returned with a third of the money in Yusuf's palm. So how is his reform hoped for after this... When two-thirds of his money was lost in disposal (Tasarruf - pun on spending/change)?\"\nThe parallel of this story in the obscenity of meaning and purity of wording is what Abu Ja'far Muhammad bin Musa al-Musawi recited to me. He said: Muhammad bin Isa al-Damghani recited, not naming its sayer: \"Remember when I sent him as a Pawn (Baydaq) (soldier)... Into you, so he met me as a Queen (Farzan).\" From the borrowing of chess players, if a pawn of theirs becomes a queen on the board, they mark it with something to distinguish it from other pawns. This poet used metonymy for that thing that it entered clean and exited marked dirty.\n\"Of\" the rare metonymy for coming to the boy is what Judge Abu Bakr al-Satti recited to me for Al-Sari al-Mawsili from verses: \"I made my camel kneel in a tavern of Utrujjah... And how good is drunkenness in it as a resting place. Wine shakes hands with itself in it... And we sow offspring in it in the salt marshes (Sabakh).\" Look how he used metonymy for sodomy with sowing in salt marshes that do not grow.\n\"Of\" the famous that fits this section is the saying of some: \"My soul fulfilled its wishes of everything... Except stabbing with the cucumber into the fig. I do not plant forever except in a balcony... And it is not permissible except under manure.\"\nAbu al-Fath al-Busti recited to me for himself: \"I ransom the gazelle who spoke to me in grammar... Debating, so I avoided the honey of his lip. And cited the accepted argument as witness... Verifying, to show me the virtue of his knowledge. Then we separated on an opinion I was pleased with... So the Nominative (Raf' - raising) is of my attribute and the Accusative (Nasb - setting up/erection) is of his attribute.\" Meaning he was the Subject (Fa'il) and the Subject is Nominative, and the Gazelle was the Object (Maf'ul bihi) Accusative.\nFor Abu Tammam in what is close to it: \"I used to call you Abdullah before, for... I have become calling you Zaid without shame. You permitted generously what you used to prevent... Not every generosity of a youth invites to honor.\" \"And for him\": \"What was in the bedroom of your affair... It is in the Congregational Mosque. O length of my thought about you from a carrier... Of a sheet with a broken seal.\"\nAs for the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz: \"And he came to me in the shirt of night, hiding... Hurrying the step out of fear and caution. So I spent the night spreading my cheek on the road for him... In humiliation, and dragging my tails on the trace. And there was what was of what I do not mention... So think good and do not ask about the news.\" It is a metonymy for declaration.\nSimilar to it is for Abd al-Samad bin al-Mu'adhdhal: \"And if souls blew yearningly... And the friend desired the nearness of the friend. There was what was between us, I do not name... It, but it is the cure of thirst.\"\nFor some people of the age, and the intent is the last verse:",

The branch of the Ban tree was suspended from its movements. The rose of the garden is ashamed at his rising... And he dismisses it with the rose in his cheeks. The blossom of the chamomile prostrates to his mouth... And the scent of the rose falls short of his breaths. When the night darkened, he reclaimed the light of the forenoon... With a face gathering beauty, some of its attributes. Oh what a night, thin of darkness... Due to the union of the gathering of intimacy after its dispersion.\"\nOf the bad of this section is the saying of some virtuous ones: \"Indeed I, when my drunkenness came... And it was time for my siesta. I entered the finger of my belly... Into the eye of the back of my friend.\"\nOf the good metonymy for thigthing is the saying of Abu Nuwas: \"And a gazelle whose buttons the soul craves... To undo. The Surah of Al-Nas (Mankind) spread him... For us after his turning away. So we circled around him... And did not approach his house.\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Sodomy and its People\"\nIf a man speaks of (prefers) boys over women, it is said: So-and-so prefers land hunting over sea hunting. \"So-and-so\" speaks of gazelles and does not speak of fish. \"And So-and-so\" loves lambs and hates ewes. Abu Nuwas said: \"I am a man who hates ewes, and... The lamb from their offspring amazes me.\"\nSo-and-so inclines to one who does not menstruate or lay eggs. The poet said: \"May I be your ransom, we chose you only... Because you do not menstruate or lay eggs. If we inclined to the connection of songstresses... The wide land would narrow with our offspring.\"\nSo-and-so writes on backs. And So-and-so loves Mim (Male) and hates Sad (Female/Box?). \"Ibn al-Rumi did evil\" in his saying: \"My hatred for Sad is famous, indeed I am a man... Whose affection is purer for the Hawamim (Mims). My hatred is not for a Quran, nor my loathing... Of it for Allah, but for Sad and Mim.\" \"Another said\": \"For dotting the Sad, Allah satisfied Qudama... And Abdullah dots every Mim.\"\nIt is said So-and-so is of the Attarin (Perfumers), and Attar is a metonymy for the Kunnas (Sweeper/Scavenger) in many lands. Abu Ishaq al-Sabi said in dispraising sodomites: \"For the need of a man in backs (Adbār) is turning back (Idbār)... And those returning to vaginas (Ahrah) are free (Ahrār). How many a clean, witty one spent the night riding... The back of a boy, so he became a perfumer (Attar).\"\nIf he speaks of (prefers) hairless beardless boys, it is said his condition is the people of Paradise, because the Prophet, peace be upon him, said in describing them: \"Hairless, beardless, kohl-eyed.\"\nIf he speaks of the small over the big, it is said So-and-so prefers kids (Sikhal) over rams. \"It is narrated\" that when Hammad Ajrad sat to educate the son of Al-Abbas bin Muhammad, Bashar bin Burd said: \"Say to the Prince, may Allah reward him with good... Let not Time gather the kid and the wolf. The kid is deceived and the wolf's concern is his negligence... And the wolf knows what goodness is in the kid.\" \"He also said\": \"O Abu al-Fadl, do not sleep... The wolf has fallen among the sheep. Indeed Hammad Ajrad... Is an evil Sheikh who has become aroused. Between his thighs is a spear... In a sheath of leather. And he, if he gets a chance... Wipes the Mim with the pen.\" When the verses spread, Al-Abbas ordered Hammad's expulsion. \"Similar\" to this slander is the saying of Abu Ishaq al-Sabi in a letter: \"O Abu al-Fadl, listen... To the saying of a man who purifies love for you. The grazing of your boys has... Become for the wolf (Sirhan) a plunder.\"\nIbn Sakra al-Hashimi had a boy he used to take as a condition (lover). When he grew up, he expelled him from his house. He was asked about that. He said: \"We left him, and in him was... For a lover, a cooing from a cook (Tabbakh). The cooing of the bird, and of... Our habits is eating chicks.\"\nIf a man speaks of small and big, it is said So-and-so hunts what is between the crane and the nightingale. \"If he\" speaks of adultery and sodomy both, it is said So-and-so hunts the two birds and grasps the two registers, and So-and-so is a pen with two heads. He recites: \"Which inkwell his pen has not met... And which roof his ladder has not reached?\"\nIf he comes and is come to (active/passive), it is said So-and-so is a quilt and a mattress, and So-and-so submits to Qisas (retaliation/equality), so at times a roof and at times a floor. \"If he\" speaks of the beauty of face without bulkiness, it is said he speaks of the World (Dunya) without the Hereafter (Akhirah). \"If he speaks of both together, it is said he speaks of the Hereafter and does not forget his share of the World.\" \"If the boy combines\" these two qualities, it is said he is World and Hereafter. \"If he is\" handsome, not bulky, it is said he is a hypocrite, and his mention has preceded.",

    "text": "\"Section on Metonymy for the Appearance of the Beard, in Praise and Dispraise\"\nAbu Nuwas used to say: \"Provision yourselves with a pleasure not found in Paradise,\" using metonymy for coming to those with cheek-hair, because the people of Paradise are all hairless and beardless. \"In the book\" Lubab al-Adab: So-and-so, the hand of beauty has enveloped him, and burned the silver of his cheek and embroidered the brocade of his face. \"Of\" the best I lecture with in metonymy for the line of the beard is the saying of some Muwallads (post-classical poets): \"A book from Beauty, its signature... From Allah, on his cheek has descended.\" How witty is what Al-Sahib used as metonymy for it with \"fuzz of beauty\" in his saying: \"Does the fuzz of beauty harm him... While the full moon by him is moon-struck?\" Badi' al-Zaman recited to me for himself from verses: \"Be as you wish, for I... Have forged a heart of iron. And I sat waiting for the eclipse... And that is not far.\" He used eclipse as metonymy for the appearance of the beard, as the other said: \"Alas for a full moon that has been eclipsed... Sorrowfully, and does sorrow avail?\" Of the innovative and hidden metonymy in this section is the saying of Judge Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Abd al-Aziz: \"Love has tormented your yearner... So give him the best of your morals. Do not shun him and observe his right... For he is the last of your lovers.\" He uses metonymy for the nearing of the beard's appearance or its appearance, and that he has no lover after it.\n\n\"The Third Chapter on Metonymy for some Waste of Food and the Place Prepared for it\"\n\"Section in its Introduction\"\nI read in \"Al-Mustanir\" that Yahya bin Ziyad, Muti' bin Iyas, and Hammad Ajrad gathered in a session enjoying themselves, and with them was a man who was their boon companion. A wind with sound exited from him, so he was ashamed and did not return to them. One of them wrote to him: \"Is it from a young she-camel that left, no one harmed her... Except she reminded her of homelands in the sand? Her shackle betrayed her, so she erupted when she grunted... And the sin in it is only upon the one who betrayed. You granted us from you abandonment and hate... And were absent from us three (days), you do not cover us (visit). Ease upon yourself, for there is no one among people... But his she-camels escape sometimes.\"\nSimilar happened to a slave girl singing in a gathering where Al-Jammaz was. She wanted to see what he had (of wit). She said: \"What do you desire me to sing for you?\" He said: \"Sing: O wind, you are not fair to the ruins... How much obliteration of a beautiful view you have!\" She laughed and knew that he had sensed that.\n\"Similar\" happened to a man in Al-Sahib's gathering. He was ashamed and cut off from him. Al-Sahib wrote to him: \"O Ibn al-Husayri, do not go in shame... For an accident that was like the flute (Nay) and the lute (Oud). For it is the wind, you cannot imprison it... Since you are not Solomon son of David.\"\n\"Similar\" happened to a youth in his gathering at night. Al-Sahib said to him: \"O boy, do not sleep.\" He was embarrassed and said: \"This is the creaking of the bench (Takht).\" Al-Sahib said: \"I reckon it to be the creaking of the 'Taht' (Under/Bottom).\"\n\"Of\" the pleasant I heard in this metonymy is the story of Abu Abdullah bin al-Hajjaj. He invited a songstress he used to flirt with. When she arrived at his place at night and the cups circulated, he dozed off, so his back cracked while she was sitting. She got angry and left. He wrote to her the next day: \"My lady got angry and denied... A crack that presented in my back. And I have no sin, but I... Creak at night and do not know. I wish I knew, while she is angry... Did the fart come from her hole or my hole?\"\n\n\"Section on the Consequence of Eating\"",

    "text": "Allah Almighty used metonymy for it with His saying: \"Or one of you came from the Gha'it (low land/privy).\" Al-Gha'it is the depressed place of the earth. They used to come to it for cover and withdrawal, then that became frequent in their speech until they named the event (defecation) by its name, and derived from it the verb 'Taghawwata'. \"Of\" the commoners' metonymies for the need to enter the toilet is their saying: \"He has a need no one else can fulfill.\" \"Of\" the subtleties of doctors is their metonymy for filling the intestines with 'Tabi'ah' (Nature) and 'Baraz' (Stool/Appearance), and for the flow of nature 'Khilfah' (Diarrhea), and for rising for it 'Ikhtilaf' (Going back and forth). \"From it\" is the saying of Abu al-Ayna', having been asked: \"To whom do you go back and forth (Takhtalif)?\" He said: \"To one who goes back and forth (Yakhtalif) against him (has diarrhea).\" Doctors may use metonymy for urine with 'Ma'' (Water) and 'Dalil' (Indicator), and for vomit with 'Ta'aluj' (Treatment).\n\"Some\" commentators said regarding the saying of Allah Almighty: \"They both used to eat food,\" and His saying: \"What is this Messenger that eats food and walks in the markets?\" that it is only a metonymy for the event (defecation), because whoever eats must have a consequence of eating and shaking off the waste. \"Al-Jahiz\" faulted them for this interpretation and said: As if they did not know that the touch of hunger and what afflicts its people of humiliation and inability is the greatest proof that they are created, so they claim upon the speech something Allah has dispensed them of. \"Mentioning\" interpretation, Abu al-Nasr Muhammad bin Abd al-Jabbar al-Qubbi said to me: Some people of Jurjan asked me about the interpretation of His saying Almighty: \"And they said: What is this Messenger that eats food and walks in the markets?\" I said: It means he is not a King nor an Angel. That is because Angels do not eat or drink, and Kings do not shop or degrade themselves. So they wondered that one like them in state is distinguished from among them in highness of place and majesty. And Allah knows best where He places His message.\n\"I read\" in the book \"Al-Mustanir\" that Abu Tammam and Al-Khath'ami met in a gathering of intimacy. Abu Tammam stood to go to the toilet. Al-Khath'ami said to him: \"We enter you (input)?\" He said: \"Yes, and I bring you out (output/excrete).\" Those present wondered at this novel beginning and strange quick answer.\n\"Similar\" to this story is what Abu al-Nasr Sahl bin al-Marzuban told me. He said: Ibn Mukarram entered upon Abu al-Ayna' and asked him to stay with him. Ibn Mukarram said: \"I will go and perform wudu (ablution).\" Abu al-Ayna' said: \"Then nothing of you returns to us,\" meaning because he is all 'Hadath' (impurity/excrement/event).\nThe people of meanings recite for Abu Sa'tara: \"They continued to give him drink all night... Foul-smelling of wine and water.\" Meaning they beat him while he was drunk until he defecated.\nBishr al-Marisi used to say, if told 'So-and-so has placed (Wada'a - authored/defecated) a book': \"Placement is of two types: one has pride, and the other has steam.\" He means the saying of the poet: \"I passed by her house and placed in it... Like the body of the sandgrouse, having steam.\"\nSome wits wrote to one drinking medicine: \"Explain to me how you became... On a state of the states. And how much the she-camel traveled with you... Towards the empty dwelling.\"\nThe author of the book wrote to the High Assembly - may Allah comfort it - on a day he took medicine: \"O owner whose origin possessed honor... And left not a tip of it for mankind. When you took the medicine and the lucky... Ascendant stood upon the resolve from you. You polished the sword of highness and purified the gold of... Glory, and life from you cleared. May you never cease sipping joy in leisure... And shaking off onto them from you sickness.\"\nThe Arabs say: \"No opinion for a 'Haqin' nor for a 'Haqib'.\" Al-Haqin is a metonymy for one holding urine. Al-Haqib is a metonymy for one who needed the toilet but did not defecate, likened to the camel 'Haqib' whose heel rope approached his front preventing him from urinating.\nMansur al-Faqih was witty in metonymy for the event (defecation) by his saying: \"Wake up, for your body is from a sperm drop... And you are a vessel for what you know.\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for the Place where that Need is Fulfilled\"\nIt is metonymized by 'Al-Hush' which is the garden, 'Al-Mustarah' (Restroom), 'Al-Mabaraz' (Place of going out), 'Al-Madhhab' (Place of going), 'Al-Mutawadda'' (Place of Wudu), and 'Al-Mida'ah'. The best I heard in that and truest is the saying of Abu al-Fath al-Baktamari: \"The most worthy house of the houses of mankind... To protect it of old and its curtains. A house, if a visitor visits it... He has fulfilled the greatest of his wishes. The master enters it in silk just as... The slave enters it in his rags. And it is, when it is cleaned... The chivalry of a man in his house.\"",

    "text": "Mentioning metonymies for that place, a story intercepted which Abu Sa'd Duwayst wrote to me with a chain to Al-Zubayr bin Bakkar. He said: Muhammad bin al-Walid al-Zubayri told me: A man from Banu Hashim arrived in Medina with two singing slave girls. He was told there was a jester there, so he sent for him and brought him. He gave him Nabidh into which he had put 'Sukkar al-Ushr' (a purgative), which loosens the belly. The Hashimi feigned sleep and winked at the two girls. When the jester drank three (cups), his belly moved. He said: \"I do not think them but Meccans.\" He said: \"May I be your ransom, where is the House of the Doctrine (Bayt al-Madhhab)?\" One said to her companion: \"What does he say?\" She said: \"He says: Sing to me: 'I went (Dhahabtu) from abandonment into other than a doctrine (Madhhab)... And the length of this avoidance was not right.'\" So he was patient over a great hateful thing. Then he said: \"I do not think them but Basrans.\" He said: \"May I be your ransom, where is the House of Emptiness (Bayt al-Khala)?\" One said to the other: \"What does he say?\" She said: \"He says: Sing: 'It became empty (Khalat) and its people departed... He destroyed it who destroyed Lubad.'\" He said: So he was patient over a great matter, and it darkened between his eyes. He said: \"I do not think them but Kufans.\" He said: \"May I be your ransom, do you not hear? Where is the House of the Garden (Bayt al-Hush)?\" One said to the other: \"What does he say?\" She said: \"He says: Sing: 'Al-Hanbadhan became wild (Awhasha), then the monastery from it... Then its villages, then the besieged dwelling.'\" The jester said: \"They did not understand me.\" He was patient over the severest thing, and his belly opened and his trick narrowed. He said: \"They are definitely Medinans.\" He said: \"May I be your ransom, where is the House of the Privy (Bayt al-Kanif)?\" One said to the other: \"What does he say?\" She said: \"He says: Sing to me: 'Passion surrounded me (Takannafani) as a child... So it grayed me while I was not middle-aged.'\" He said: \"O two adulteresses, I will inform you what it is.\" He stood up lifting his robe and defecated on them and filled the gathering. The Hashimi woke up and said: \"Woe to you! What have you done?\" He said: \"You sat me with these two adulteresses who do not think the Kanif is anything but the Straight Path. They envy me being guided to it.\" He said: \"Do you spoil my clothes on me?\" He said: \"By Allah, what I spoiled on myself of my belly is more severe than what I spoiled of your gathering.\"\n\"I\" conclude this section with a report from the Prophet, peace be upon him, in metonymy for defecating in streets and paths of passersby, which is his saying, peace upon him: \"Beware of the two cursers, and prepare the paths.\"\n\nChapter Four\nMetonymy regarding Uglinesses, Disabilities, and Defects\n\n\"Section One: On Ugliness and Blackness\"\nIf a man is ugly in creation, deformed in image, it is said in metonymy for him: \"He has relatives in Yemen,\" because monkeys abound there.\n\"Of the pleasant\" metonymy for ugliness is the saying of Abu Nuwas: \"A female sayer to her in the passion of advice... Why did you abandon this wandering lover? Her answer was in touching beauty... Do I combine this and the Haram (sin)?\" This is like their saying: \"Bad dates and bad measure.\"\nIf he is intensely dark-skinned with ugliness, it is said: \"As if his face is the moon of the thirtieth (no moon).\"\nThe saying of Nusayb is deemed good in metonymy for the blackness of his daughters in a speech he addressed Umar bin Abdul Aziz with: \"O Commander of the Faithful, I have been afflicted with daughters of mine on whom I spent my color, so they became stagnant (unmarried).\" He pitied him and gave him a gift. Regarding Nusayb it was said: \"A brother of mine from the sons of Ham bin Noah... His forehead was the Stone of the Maqam (Black Stone).\"\n\"It is told\" in a long story regarding Sukayna bint al-Husayn bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them, that she ordered the expulsion of Al-Farazdaq from her house and said: \"By Allah, he shall not enter upon me until the crow turns grey.\" Al-Farazdaq was gentle and tricked, and said to Nusayb: \"Will you bring me in to her and take her gift?\" He said: \"Yes.\" So he asked permission for Nusayb from the doorman. He permitted him, and Al-Farazdaq entered on his track. When Sukayna saw him, she said: \"O malicious one, you have betrayed me.\" He said: \"O my mistress, you said 'until the crow turns grey', and here, by Allah, is the crow turned grey,\" meaning the blackness of his (Nusayb's) face and the whiteness of his hair. Nusayb said: \"I knew he did not intend good for me.\" Then she expiated for her oath and gave them abundant gifts.\nNo one used metonymy for the black praised one better and more innovatively than Al-Mutanabbi's metonymy for the blackness of Kafur al-Ikhshidi by his saying: \"So she came with us to the pupil of the eye of his time... And left whiteness behind her and tear ducts.\" He combined good metonymy with good alerting and quality of preference, and excelled as he wished.\n\n\"Section on Heaviness and Coldness\"\nAbu Ja'far Muhammad bin Musa al-Musawi told me: I entered one day upon Sheikh Abu Nasr bin Arbad in Bukhara. With him was a boring Alawite; he was hurt by the length of his sitting and abundance of his speech. When he rose, Abu Nasr said to me: \"This cousin of yours is light on the heart.\" I said to him: \"Yes,\" agreeing with him on his opinion. He smiled laughing at my saying and said to me: \"I see you did not notice the purpose.\" I ceased not to think until it occurred to me that he meant 'light' inverted, which is 'heavy'. This meaning Sa'd Duwayst intended by his saying: \"And a heavy one who visited me, and as if he... Turned in the eyelids of my eye and in my heart.",

    "text": "I said to him when I was bored by his nearness... I see you on my heart light on the heart (pun on Qalb/Heart/Inversion).\"\nAl-Nasir the Alawite, the Deaf (Al-Utrush), used to say if a person spoke to him and he did not hear him: \"O you, raise your voice, for some of what is in your spirit has become apparent to me,\" using metonymy for heaviness.\nBadi' al-Zaman looked at a cold, tall human and said: \"The winter night has approached, for it is long, cold.\"\nIbn Abi Ayyub entered upon Ibn Haddar visiting him while he was shivering. He said to him: \"What do you find (feel), may I be your ransom?\" He said: \"I find you,\" using metonymy for coldness.\n\n\"Section\" on Metonymy for the Disease that has no Cure except by Disobedience to Allah\nIt is said: So-and-so hides the Staff (Al-Asa). And So-and-so is the Staff of Moses, because it swallows what they fabricate. And So-and-so hides the staff in the far vestibule.\n\"Abu Nasr Sahl bin al-Marzuban told me\" said: Some of Banu Hashim said to Abu al-Ayna': \"It reached me that you hide the staff.\" He said to him: \"And you (plural) invite it to appear.\"\nAl-Tabari recited to me for himself regarding the Bridle (Lijam): \"I saw for the bridle in its creation... A conformity to poetry and a pun. It fraternized with Pharaoh, but it... Punned in carrying the Staff with Moses. And covered (Ghshsha - tricked/covered) Iblis, but it... Differed in prostration from Iblis.\"\nIt is said: So-and-so is of those who fall down on their chins. \"And he is\" more prostrating than a hoopoe. Regarding that, some contemporaries say: \"I sent in describing a friend of ours... A truth metonymized by the mosque (Masjid). In beauty a peacock, but he is... More prostrating in seclusion than a hoopoe.\"\nAnd So-and-so is a crow, because he hides the shame of his brother. Mansur al-Faqih said: \"Indeed in the affair of Ahmad bin al-Tahawi... And in the affair of his wife is a wonder. She divorced herself the evening she was wed... And permitted him her wine and clothes. It was said: What is the matter with him? She said: A crow... Did you stipulate on a husband a crow?\"\nOf Al-Sahib's witticisms in this metonymy is his saying, and it is narrated for another: \"He has a field in his trousers... In which he plants sugar cane.\" \"And his saying\": \"He attended the mosque with a softness... Which the world innovated in his religion. By Allah, he does not attend it rushing... Except out of relief for its columns.\" \"And his saying\": \"I saw him yesterday carrying the staff... So I asked him about it to clarify an excuse. He answered me: I am acting like an old Sheikh with it... This, and I have in it other uses.\" \"And his saying\": \"By Allah, I did not take writing as a craft... Except for the love of scrolls (Daraj - pun on Insertions/Stairs) and pens (Aflam - pun on Boys/Pens).\"\nProfessor Al-Tabari recited to me for himself from a poem: \"He said: I am the King (Al-Malik). So I said: Truly... By turning the Lam into Nun in spelling (Manik - F****d). And I did not see of the tool of the King anything... With you except your bearing of the banner (Liwa - pun on twisting/banner).\" He also recited to me from another: \"You do not sacrifice a sword for Islam... And you, as you knew, are of the column (Amud). And you are ascetic regarding prayer and its people... But you are not ascetic regarding prostration.\"\nIt is narrated that Ibn al-Ahwas looked at Al-Farazdaq while he was on a mule. He said to him: \"O Abu Firas, your mule is on five (legs).\" He said: \"The fifth is dearer to you.\" Al-Ahwas was accused of Ubnah (passive sodomy).\n\"Of\" the good allusion to it is the saying of Amr bin Babah: \"I say when Amr passed by us... And greeted a hidden greeting. If Amr boasted of the virtue of wealth... Indeed Allah favored with wellness (Afiyah).\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Leprosy (Baras)\"\nJadhima was a leper, so he was metonymized as Al-Waddah (The Bright) and Al-Abrash (The Speckled). When Bal'a bin Qays became leprous, it was said to him: \"What is this?\" He said: \"The sword of Allah polished it,\" and it is narrated \"adorned it (hallahu)\" with Ha and Shadda on Lam. \"Among those\" who used metonymy for leprosy with \"Wadah\" (Brightness) is a man from Banu Nahshal where he said: \"Sawdah fled from me when she saw... Baldness of the head in my skin and brightness (Wadah). It is an adornment for me in the face just as... The blazes of the colt adorn the horses.\" Ibn Hassa said in metonymy for it with whiteness: \"Do not think whiteness in him is a defect... Indeed the excellent horses among their peers are piebald.\" \"For some of them\": \"The brother of Lakhm lent you a garment from him... Congratulations on the shirt to you, O speckled one.\" The brother of Lakhm is Jadhima the Speckled. A man leprous of hand used to dye it to be more hidden for what is in it. His boy was asked what he does. He said: \"He treats ivory with teak (blackwood).\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy\" regarding several disabilities.\nThe blind is metonymized by \"Al-Mahjub\" (The Veiled). Regarding that, Uthman bin al-Walid bin Utbah says: \"By my life, if I entered evening upon blindness... Indeed, the noble ones before me were afflicted in sights. Umayyah and his son lived veiled... Our father Abu Amr, and Harb, and Hashim.\"",

    "text": "When Al-Mutawakkil wanted Abu al-Ayna' for his boon companionship, he said to him: \"O Commander of the Faithful, I am veiled (blind). The veiled one errs in his intent, and turns to one who does not turn to him. Everyone in your gathering serves, and I need to be served in it.\"\nThe one-eyed is metonymized by \"Al-Mumatta'\" (The One Allowed Enjoyment). The one with a white spot in his eye by \"Al-Kawkabi\" (Starry) and \"Al-Mukawkab\". The one with a scar on his face by \"Al-Mushattab\". \"How\" excellent is how Awf bin Muhallim used metonymy for deafness by his saying: \"Indeed the eighty, and I reached them... Have made my hearing in need of a translator.\"\n\n\"Section on Miserliness\"\nThe miser is metonymized by \"Al-Muqtasid\" (The Frugal). It is said: \"So-and-so is clean of kitchen\" and \"So-and-so is pure of pot.\" The poet said: \"White of kitchens, their maids do not complain... Of cooking of pots nor washing of napkins.\" \"Another said: The kitchen of Dawood in its cleanliness... Is the most resembling thing to the throne of Bilqis. The clothes of his cook, if they get dirty... Are purer in whiteness than papyruses.\" Abu Nuwas: \"I saw the pots of people black from burning... And the pot of the Raqashis is white like the full moon.\" Al-Jammaz said to a man: \"May Allah have mercy on your father, for he was clean of the napkin of the table.\" Professor Al-Tabari said: \"A youth, restricted of food... And drink and perfume. Pure of bread and bowl... And napkin and pot. Little of ants and flies... And rats and cats.\" Mentioning the lack of rats, a Bedouin woman said to one of the Caliphs: \"I complain of the lack of rats.\" He said: \"How beautiful is this metonymy! I will surely increase your rats.\" He ordered much food and money for her. Of the rare metonymy for miserliness with food is the saying of Humayr when asked who attends the table of Muhammad bin Yahya. He said: \"The most noble of creation and the meanest of them,\" meaning angels and flies. Not cold is the saying of Hammad Ajrad: \"I visited a man in his house, glorious... Having modesty and having good. He hates to give indigestion to his guests... Indeed the harm of indigestion is cautioned. And desires that they be rewarded with him... By fasting, and the fasting one is rewarded.\" Of that is the saying of the other: \"At his doors, whichever face... You intended for him, is the brother of Murr ibn Udd (Bitter son of Udd - pun on turning back).\" Among what is deemed good in this chapter is the saying of Ibn Tabataba al-Alawi: \"And a scribe, a calculator, if you intended seeking... What is in his hands when you went begging him. He added ninety followed by its three... To three thousand and nine hundred.\" And his saying in this exact metonymy: \"If I intended what is in your hands begging... Or came complaining to you the tightness of my hand. You knotted for me with the left hand four... Clasped, seven of the number.\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy\" regarding a group of defects and blameworthy morals.\nIf a man is ignorant, it is said: \"So-and-so is of the resting ones,\" due to their saying: \"He rested who has no mind.\" \"If he is\" safe of side, simple-minded, it is said: \"So-and-so is of the people of Paradise,\" because the Prophet, peace be upon him, says: \"Most of the people of Paradise are the simple-minded (Bulh).\" \"If he is\" stupid, they said: \"His adjective (Na't) is diptote (La Yansarif - does not conjugate/leave).\" \"Abu al-Hasan al-Shahrazuri recited to me,\" he said: Abu al-Hasan al-Lajjam recited to me for himself regarding Ibn Matran al-Shashi when he was dismissed from the post of Tirmidhiyyah: \"We were dismissed (Surifna), and everyone who... Was before us is dismissed (Munsarif). And we were dismissed by a poet... Whose adjective is diptote (Laysa Yansarif).\"\nIf he is meddlesome, entering into what does not concern him, taking upon himself what is not binding on him, they said: \"He is the executor (Wasi) of Adam.\" This description may be placed in the place of praise, as the poet said: \"And Adam was, when his death was decreed... Commanded you while he was breathing his last with the soul. That you tend them, so you tended them... And sufficed Adam the cost of the sons.\"\nIf he is impudent, they said: \"There is a shield (Daraqah) and a pupil and a hammered (Mutraqa) cheek.\" \"This\" word is by Al-Sahib from a letter of his to Abu al-Abbas al-Dabbi mentioning Abu al-Hasan al-Jawhari the poet.\nIf he is little of brain, they said: \"So-and-so is empty of the upper room.\" The poet said: \"Our friend, his conditions are high... But his upper room is empty.\"\nIf he is very reckless, they said: \"Bring a peg (Watad) with him.\" \"If\" he is a liar, they said: \"The turtle-dove is with him Abu Dharr.\" This word is sweet from the witticisms of Al-Sahib, and I have not heard in its meaning better or more eloquent than it, because the turtle-dove is cited as a proverb (for lying). The poet said: \"More lying than a turtle-dove... Saying amidst the dry leaves and spadix: This is the time of fresh dates... While it has not appeared to her.\" And Abu Dharr al-Ghifari is the one about whom the Prophet, peace be upon him, says: \"The green (sky) has not shaded nor the dusty (earth) carried one more truthful in tone than Abu Dharr.\" \"Of\" their metonymies for lying: \"So-and-so slaps the eye of Mahran.\" \"Mahran\" is a man cited as a proverb in lying. \"If\" he is boring, it is said: \"So-and-so is of the remnant of the people of Moses,\" as he said:",

    "text": "\"I see you a remnant of the people of Moses... For they do not have patience for one food.\"\nIf he is of much affectation and arrogance, they said: \"So-and-so increases the saffron.\" They compare him to the pot made with affectation.\nIf he is beautiful of appearance but has no substance, they said: \"So-and-so is Faludhaj of the market.\" Al-Hajjaj said: \"And how many a friend pleasing my eye... In the mold of beauty and elegance. He has no opinion in the beautiful... Nor does he do the beautiful a bit. As if he, walking in the shirt, is... Faludhaj of the market in a thin sheet.\"\n\"If\" he is bad of handwriting, they said: \"So-and-so, his handwriting is the handwriting of angels,\" because the best handwriting is the clearest, and the worst is the opposite, and the handwriting of angels is not clear to people. \"I heard\" Abu al-Qasim bin al-Hasan al-Tarani the Jurist say: I heard Abu Muhammad Yahya bin Muhammad al-Alawi say: That was only said because the worst handwriting is 'Raqm' (scribble/numerals), and the writing of angels is 'Raqm', as Allah Almighty said: \"A written (Marqum) book. Witnessed by those brought near.\"\n\"If he is\" a foundling with no known father, they said: \"He is of the upbringing of the Judge and of the clients of the Prophet, peace be upon him,\" because the Judge orders the upbringing of foundlings and spending on them from the picked-up property for acts of charity, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, says: \"I am the patron of who has no patron.\" This meaning Abu Nuwas intended by his saying: \"We found Al-Fadl more generous than Riqqash... Because Al-Fadl, his patron is the Messenger.\"\nIt is told that a man accused of false claim (of lineage) said to Abu Ubaida when he was accused of the Book of Vices (Mathalib): \"Do you insult the Arabs all together?\" He said: \"And what harms you of that?\" Meaning he is not of them. \"If\" he claimed lineage in Hashim while he is a false claimant, they said: \"He is the cousin of the Prophet from Al-Duldul,\" which is his mule. Meaning the kinship between them is like the kinship between the Prophet and the mule. Regarding that, Abu Sa'd Duwayst says: \"I ransom you; you are not of Hashim... Nor are you of Ahmad the Sent. If you said I am the cousin of the Prophet... Then you are a cousin from Al-Duldul.\" The wittiest I heard in metonymy for false claim and lying of lineage is the saying of Abu al-Fath Kushajim: \"A Sheikh of ours from the Sheikhs of Kufa... His lineage in Iraq is prescribed (Mawsufah).\" Meaning falsified (Muzawwarah), because 'Muzawwarah' (broth for sick) is prescribed for the sick.\n\"If he is\" a heretic, they said: \"So-and-so is free (Hurr) and he is of the free,\" using metonymy that he is outside the noose of Sharia. \"Perhaps\" they used metonymy with \"Al-Kharrat\" (Stripper/Turner), since the dogs of Mecca are called \"Al-Kharrata\" because they strip their collars and their treachery. So the heretic is without religion just as the dogs of Mecca are without treachery (loyalty?). \"Abu\" Dulaf al-Khazraji has a poem in imitating Banu Sasan and describing their classes, and in it in mentioning their heretics: \"Men who realized regarding transmission... And causation and the command. Khalijis who did not menstruate... Nor spent the night upon purity.\" The Khaliji is the one who does not wash his anus. \"Did not menstruate\" meaning did not purify. They saw the wisdom of stripping collars with treachery. The people of Baghdad say to one who committed heresy: \"So-and-so has crossed,\" meaning he has crossed the bridge of Islam. It was said to some of them: \"Have you crossed?\" He said: \"I was born in that place,\" using metonymy that he never ceased to be so.\nIf he is vile, mean, it is said: \"He is the eighth of the Companions of the Cave,\" because Allah Almighty says in their story: \"And their eighth is their dog.\"\n\"If\" they were in the count of beasts and livestock, they said as the poet said: \"Are you not of the male whom He mentioned... In Surah Al-Jumu'ah and Al-Nahl?\" Meaning the saying of Allah Almighty in Surah Al-Jumu'ah: \"Like the donkey carrying books.\" \"And in\" Surah Al-Nahl: \"And horses and mules and donkeys for you to ride.\"\n\"If he eats\" their food, they said: \"So-and-so is inflamed of stomach, and in his vitals is Mu'awiyah.\" \"If he is\" bad mannered in eating together, they said: \"His hand travels on the table and grazes the land of neighbors.\"\n\"If he is\" light-handed in pickpocketing and theft, they said: \"He is taker of the hand of the shirt.\" The hand of the shirt is the sleeve. The thief cuts his sleeve and lightens it to be more capable of his work. Al-Farazdaq said regarding Amr bin Hubayrah: \"You gave charge of Iraq and its dwellers... To a Fazari who took the hand of the shirt.\" He also said, and it is of the verses of meanings: \"I think you are bereaved of a quarter, a hypocrite... Wearing the robes of betrayal and treachery.\" He used metonymy for his right hand being cut off, so a quarter of his limbs goes.\n\"If he is\" not clean of body, neglecting its care, they said: \"So-and-so is nails of a fever (Huma) and wrapper of a pasture.\" Good is Abu Nuwas's saying: \"Whoever his hunting place is far from him... Then the hunting place of the hornet is his clothes.\" \"And for Al-Sahib\": \"His wild animals graze in his robe... And his nail rides for hunting.\" \"Of\" the commoners' metonymies in this meaning is their saying: \"He reviews the soldiers.\" \"Sa'id\" bin Humayd excelled in metonymy for body odor by his saying to Abu Hiffan: \"The Abdi (slave?) has become frightening me with his assault... And how can I be safe from the might of the crushing lion?",

But the stuffing of that robe is his shit. If you pass his clothing to him... There is no village behind Abadan.\"\nIf he is illegitimate, they said: \"His father is short of wall.\" Al-Sahib said from verses: \"So pave for his erectness (Nasb - pun on lineage/erection) his excuse... For the walls of his father's house are short.\"\nIf he has madness, they said: \"So-and-so is written on the shirt,\" because the madman may have written on his shirt \"Not to be sold or gifted.\" In metonymy for the enmity-holder, Abu Sa'd bin Duwayst says: \"And opposing the truth, not allied... To truthfulness, a slave of debate and argumentation. He left the pilgrims (Hujjaj) for disputation (Lajjaj), so I said: O... Abomination of chickens and station of pilgrims (Hajjaj).\" I heard Abu al-Fadl Abdullah bin Ahmad al-Mikali say: Abu Ubaida said: \"Al-Aridah\" is a metonymy for giving. It is said: \"So-and-so is strong of Aridah.\" And \"Al-Iqtisad\" (Economy) is a metonymy for miserliness. If they said \"Your boy is rebellious (Musta'sin),\" that is a metonymy for hunger. Shurayh said: \"Al-Hadd\" (Limit/Edge) is a metonymy for effort and hardship.\n\n\"Section on Metonymy\" for Dispraising Poets and Poetry\nIf a man is a pseudo-poet not a poet, they said: \"So-and-so is the Prophet of Poetry,\" because Allah Almighty says regarding His Prophet, peace be upon him: \"And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it befitting for him.\" Mukhallad al-Mawsili said: \"O Prophet of Allah in poetry... And O Jesus son of Mary. You are of the most poetic creation... Of Allah as long as you do not speak.\" They sing the saying of the poet: \"Poets, as we know, are four... A poet who runs and is not run with. And a poet who recites in the middle of the crowd. And a poet whom it is your right to hear. And a poet whom it is your right to slap. And him I meant by saying: O fourth of poets, why did you satirize me?... Did you think I am silenced, not speaking?\" For some people of the age: \"Say to our heavy poet... Raised by his appearance over the watchers. O second of sudden death and third... Of Husayn, indeed you are the fourth of poets.\"\nIf he is cold of poetry, they said: \"So-and-so is from the family of Summer.\" Al-Jammaz said regarding Abu al-Samt: \"Indeed Abu al-Samt... And his poetry are of the family of heat. Blessed is he for whom in summer is recited... Five verses of poetry.\" Ibn Wariq al-Kufi said regarding Al-Suli's poetry: \"My house is without Khaysh (cooling linen), but I... Knot from my Khaysh two layers of a house. Whenever my heat intensifies in it... I recited two verses of Al-Suli.\" Ahmad bin Tahir said regarding Al-Fath bin Khaqan when he fell ill from heat: \"What is the medicine of Prince Fath bin Khaqan... ?? this time. The medicine of the Prince is that they recite to him... Some of what ?? Abu Hiffan.\" It was said to Al-Attabi: \"Abu Muslim has paralyzed creation.\" He said: \"Perhaps he ate from his poetry.\" \"A group\" of poets gathered over a hot Faludhaj. One of them said to the other among them: \"As if it is your place in the Fire.\" He said: \"A verse of your poetry fixes it.\" \"It was said\" to Professor Tabari: \"So-and-so's poetry ?? but like well water in summer.\" He took it from the saying of Ibn al-Rumi: \"You are to me like the water of your well in summer... Heavy ?? severe cold.\" \"Abu al-Hasan al-Himyari recited to me\" for himself in metonymy for bad, uncirculated poetry: \"We have a friend whose poetry is domestic... It does not get used to travels and estrangement. But I hear it observing... His right in the precedence of companionship.\"\n\n\"Section on Asking and Begging (Kudyah)\"",

    "text": "The first to use metonymy for asking (begging) was Khalid bin Barmak. Abdullah bin Sharik al-Numayri came to him in a group of the people of Sawtat seeking his generosity. Beggars (Su'al) were called Su'al. Khalid said: \"I, by Allah, find this name ugly for them, and among them are nobles and generous ones. But we call them Visitors (Zuwar).\" Abdullah said to him: \"By Allah, I do not know if our visiting you is greater, or our gift, or our naming.\" Yazid bin Khalid al-Kufi, known as Ibn Hubaybat, said regarding that: \"Khalid followed in his generosity the cut of Barmak... So glory for him is new and rooted. The sons of lack used to be attributed before him... To a name in which there is evidence of lack. They are called Su'al (Beggars) in every place... Even if among them is a famous and great one. So he named them Zuwar (Visitors) as a covering for them... And that is of the action of the noble, noble.\" Al-Suli mentioned this report for other than Khalid with a chain of his, that Al-Musawir bin al-Nu'man, when he governed the districts of Fars, people came to him. It was said to him: \"Your Su'al (beggars) have gathered.\" He said: \"How ugly is this name! These are Visitors.\" So they were named by it from that day. Ziyad al-A'jam says regarding it: \"Indeed Al-Musawir gave in his gift... To his askers the best of names for humans. They used to be called Su'al, so he made them... Without creation, Zuwar, and he did not deviate.\"\nIt is said: \"So-and-so is of the companions of the Bag and the Niche (Mihrab),\" and \"So-and-so is of the reciters of Surah Yusuf,\" because the reciters of beggars increase in reading it in markets, gatherings, and mosques because it is the best of stories. Muhammad bin Wahb said: \"If you were memorizing of poems and grammar... Indeed you were of the reciters of Surah Yusuf.\"\nIt is said: \"So-and-so is the successor of Khidr\" if he is roaming in travels, traversing lands in begging. \"He may\" be described with this metonymy who increases his risings and connects his movements even if for other than begging. Some of them were seen begging in a village. He was asked: \"What are you doing?\" He said: \"What Moses and Khidr did,\" meaning they asked the people of a village for food.\n\"Nasr bin Sahl bin al-Marzuban told me\" said: A son was born to Abu al-Ayna'. Abu Ali al-Basir came to him congratulating him. He said: \"What time did he leave his mother?\" He said: \"The time of morning at the beating of the drums.\" Abu Ali said: \"I hope Allah makes you know his blessing, for he did not miss his time,\" meaning that beggars spread at that time for begging.\n\"It is said\" a man asked some of the pretending-to-be-rich. The asked one said to him: \"Our interior is like your exterior, and the garden is all celery,\" meaning he is like him in poverty and need for asking.\n\"Some\" eloquent ones wrote in demanding provisions for a man: \"So-and-so is residing waiting for his answer and the fruit of his acceptance (Ijab),\" using metonymy for the gift with 'fruit of acceptance', and he did very well. \"I said\" in the book \"Al-Mubhij\": \"Whoever brought the pearls of speech milked the udder of the noble.\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Poverty and Bad State\"\n\"It is said\": \"So-and-so has worn the slogan of the righteous,\" meaning he became poor. \"And it is said\": \"So-and-so, the hem of his state thinned, and his house resembles the heart of Moses' mother (empty), and he reads Surah Al-Tariq,\" meaning nothing is seen in it but the sky and stars. \"And it is said\": \"So-and-so came to us in a shirt upon which Time ate and drank, and a Jubbah reciting 'When the sky splits open'.\" \"And So-and-so\", his bed is the dusty (earth) and his cover is the green (sky), if he does not cover himself from Allah with anything.\n\"Abu al-Hasan Muhammad bin Abdullah known as Ibn Sakra entered\" the Bathhouse of Musa in Baghdad, and his sandal was stolen. He said: \"Thieves shoulder to shoulder upon it until... He goes barefoot who greets by it and goes naked. I did not intend a robe by it, but... I entered as Muhammad and exited as Bishr,\" meaning Bishr the Barefoot.\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Slapping (Saf')\"\nAbu Hiffan used to say: \"I do not joke except with the two hands and the two parents,\" using metonymy for slapping and cursing.\nOf the most eloquent I heard in metonymy for slapping is the saying of Ismail al-Sabhi regarding Abu Nuwas: \"And when he addressed our honors... And there was no avenger for his honor. We wrote satire on his neck veins... With a transcript from the palms of servants.\"\nOf what is deemed witty is the saying of Ibn Lank in Abu Riyash: \"His fingers from the sweets are yellow... But the neck veins from him are red.\" \"And his saying\": \"I did not kiss his mouth, but... The palm of my hand kissed the back of his neck.\"\nThe saying of Mansur al-Faqih is approved: \"O you who sees me while creation... All of it in knowledge is below him, protect. Do not button upon it your... Collar if it appears to you to protect it.\"\nWhat Abu Bakr al-Khawarizmi recited to me for some regarding an impudent slapped person is deemed good: \"His weapon is in his face... And his money is in his crown. So all that he owns... He gathers in his turban.\"\nHow subtle is the saying of Al-Sari al-Mawsili in metonymy for slapping: \"A people, if delegations attend the kings... Their turbans are shaken off at the doors.\"",

    "text": "Nothing wittier was seen in this meaning than what Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Ahmad bin Abdan recited to me for Ibn Sakra regarding Ibn Qari'a: \"I saw a tall cap seeking help... From above a head calling out: Take me. It has become anxious, so it sometimes leans... From the left and from the right. I said to it: What is it that afflicted you? She said the speech of a sad, depressed one: It afflicted me that I am not of my mold... And I fear that people will deny me. And if they take to joking with me... And if they do that to me, they will cut me.\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Lowly Crafts\"\nAl-Sha'bi was asked about a man who proposed to a woman. He said: \"He is soft of sitting, penetrating of stab.\" So he was married, and behold he was a tailor. Al-Jahiz narrated about Al-Nazzam that he used metonymy for the weaver with \"the most waisted of belly,\" meaning that subsidence has waisted his belly. \"A cupper was asked\" about his craft. He said: \"I write with iron and seal with glass.\"\n\"Of the best\" I heard in this metonymy is what is told that Al-Farazdaq entered upon Bilal bin Abi Burda while he was dispraising Mudar and praising Yemen. Al-Farazdaq said: \"Indeed the virtue of Yemen is not repelled, especially the one by which Abu Musa was distinguished.\" Bilal said: \"Indeed the virtues of Abu Musa are many, so which one do you mean?\" He said: \"By his breath from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, when his blood overcame him,\" meaning that he cupped him in some of his travels. Bilal said: \"Yes, he did that to the Messenger of Allah, and he did not do it to anyone before him nor after him.\" Al-Farazdaq said: \"The Sheikh was more God-fearing and knowledgeable of Him than to proceed upon His Prophet without skill.\" Bilal was silent and held a grudge for it against Al-Farazdaq. It was counted among Al-Farazdaq's silencing answers.\n\"Of the rare\" metonymy for the cupper and its famous ones is the saying of Utbah al-A'war to Ibrahim bin Sayyar: \"O son of him who lived not persecuted... May Allah have mercy on you, what a man! The necks of kings are submissive to him... Among barefoot and shod. Your father, the baldric wore out his shoulder... How many a brave warrior he bled, and a hero. He takes from his money and from his blood... He does not spend the evening fearful of an avenger. In his palm is a sharp edge that overcomes him... Cutting the necks of noble masters.\"\nThe night patrol in Kufa caught a man. He said to him: \"Who are you?\" He recited: \"I am the son of him whose rank Time does not lower... And if it descends one day, it will return. You see people in crowds at the door of his house... If he passes, and delegations come to him.\" So he let him go and thought him the son of some nobles. Behold, he was the son of a bean seller (Baqilani).\n\"Abu al-Fadl al-Mikali recited to me\" for Abu Bakr al-Allaf regarding Al-Zajjaji the Grammarian: \"You have an affection we have mended... But its cracks exhausted us. So behold, your affection is of what... You were selling yesterday (Glass/Zujaj).\"\n\n\"The Fifth Chapter\"\n\"On Metonymy for Illness, Greyness, Old Age, and Death\"\n\"Section on Illness\"\nThis section is limited to the words of the eloquent of the people of the age in metonymy for illness occurring in the sections of this chapter. \"Of them\" is their saying: \"Time scratched him,\" which is from the saying of Abu al-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi to Sayf al-Dawla: \"Time scratched you out of passion and love... And the beloved may hurt out of affection.\" \"Of them\" is their saying: \"A period of lethargy appeared to him,\" \"Hit his wood,\" \"Generosity complained for his complaint,\" \"There appeared to him what Allah makes purification not punishment, reminder not denial, discipline not anger,\" \"There appeared to him what erases his sins and expiates his bad deeds.\"\n\"Al-Sahib used metonymy\" for scabies by his saying to Abu al-Ala al-Asadi from verses: \"Abu al-Ala, King of Jest and Seriousness... How are the stars that rise in the skin?\"\nI heard Professor Al-Tabari say in mentioning a sick person nearing destruction: \"The messengers of Abu Yahya have frequented him.\"\n\"Abu Mansur al-Shirazi wrote\" mentioning the intensification of the illness of some chiefs: \"The ascendant of Generosity oscillates, his star swings between shining and setting, and his sun inclines between rising and setting.\"\n\n\"Section on their Metonymies for Greyness\"\nHis night approached. The branch of his youth blossomed. The hand of Time sprinkled camphor on his musk. His tube lobed (?). Chamomile appeared in his violet. \"The best\" of all this is the saying of Allah, Exalted is His Name: \"And the warner came to you.\"\nThe people of meanings recite the saying of some Arabs: \"When I saw the vulture defeated the son of Da'yah... And nested in his two nests, my chest boiled for it.\" The Vulture is a metonymy for greyness, and Ibn Da'yah is the crow, used as metonymy for youth.\n\n\"Section on their Metonymies for Middle Age (Iktihal)\"\nHe exchanged the piebald for the black. And the magpie for the crow. He was disciplined by the bridle of Time. The dust of boyhood was shaken off. He responded to the caller of intellect. He was clothed in the clothes of the people of minds. He reached the time of wisdom.\n\n\"Section on their Metonymies for Old Age\"",

    "text": "And Great Age and Decrepitude and Nearing Death. He has been given ample respite. The decades of his life have doubled. Age has ended with him. The sweet days have passed. So-and-so is the afternoon sun on the wall. He has reached the coast of life. He stood at the Farewell Pass. He overlooked the Abode of Stay. He almost joined the Subtle, the Aware.\n\"When\" Mu'awiyah's incisor fell in the basin, his anxiety intensified. Abu al-A'war al-Sulami said to him: \"Ease upon yourself, O Commander of the Faithful. By Allah, no one reached your age except parts of him destroyed parts.\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Death\"\nAllah claimed him for Himself. Allah made him happy with His neighborhood. Allah transferred him to the abode of His pleasure and place of His forgiveness. The happiness of the dying one was written for him. It led him to the awaited matter. Allah chose for him the transfer from the abode of ruin to the place of the righteous. I appreciate the saying of Al-Muraqqish Al-Akbar: \"There is no regret over the length of life... And behind a man is what he knows.\"\nAbu Nasr Sahl bin al-Marzuban told me, he said: Ibn Mukarram entered upon Abu al-Ayna' visiting. He said to him: \"Rise, may I be your ransom.\" He said: \"May Allah raise you to Him,\" meaning cause him to die. \"A man teased\" some wits. He said to him: \"I saw you under me.\" He said: \"With three like me,\" meaning in carrying his funeral.\n\"I heard\" some wise men say in metonymy for the death of a friend of his: \"So-and-so has completed the definition of Man,\" because the definition of Man is that he is a rational living being. They often use metonymy for the grave with \"Al-Turbah\" (Soil), \"Al-Madja'\" (Bed), \"Al-Marqad\" (Sleeping place), and \"Al-Mashhad\" (Scene/Shrine).\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Killing\"\nHe prayed to the heat of blades before the heat of Fire. A hero and a heavy rain watered the earth with his blood. He lacked the coolness of life and tasted the heat of sharp swords. He quenched from him the thirst of the sword. Better than all this is the saying of Allah Almighty: \"So Moses struck him with his fist and ended him,\" meaning killed him.\n\"Abu al-Nasr Muhammad bin Abd al-Jabbar told me\" said: The Vizier of the time handed over some virtuous workers to Ibn Abi al-Baghl when he rose to the head of his work in Ahvaz, and ordered him to employ him in his works in what he deemed suitable for him to mend the defect of his state. So he employed him over some funds of the Treasury. Then he killed him under demand for what the judgment of fulfillment gathered against him. He feared the consequence of retaliation for his crime against a deposit of one whose favor he was obliged to thank. Thought led to devising what would get him out of the responsibility of his haste and untie him from the noose of his crime. He did not find for that a shifting meaning nor a word indicative of the intent. He sought someone to search for him with an excuse and necessitate for him a cause of separation from the consequence of that dealing on the condition of a state whose danger is great and whose effect appears in blocking the poverty of the state. Until he was guided to a Sheikh from the masters of the craft whom ordeal had crippled and unemployment stagnated. He called him and asked him to compose a letter to the Vizier regarding important matters of the faces of dealings and regarding the story of the killing in the folding of speech. He said to him: \"Write an excuse with this meaning.\" He wrote: \"As for So-and-so, the Vizier ordered using him. When I used him (Ista'maltuhu), I found him claiming rights (Istahwaytuhu - from Hawa/containing?), so I performed him (Addaytuhu - paid him/performed upon him?), so he agreed with the appointed term (Al-Ajal - death).\" Ibn Abi al-Baghl wondered at his ability, quick acumen, and strength of mind in extracting what belongs to the concise wording and the shifting meaning from the responsibility of his crimes. He gave him abundant money and occupied him with a great work.\nThe author of the book said: I think the Sheikh alluded in the meaning of what he wrote to a signature by Abdullah bin Tahir, but increased in improving it and the subtlety of its refinement. Abdullah had beaten some of his commanders a severe beating from which he died. His news was raised to him. He signed: \"We beat him for his sin, so he died for his term (Ajal).\"\n\nThe Sixth Chapter\nRegarding what Time and Condition necessitate of Metonymy regarding Food and Drink\nAnd what connects to them\n\"Section on Foods and what relates to them\"",

He used metonymy for meat because in his story, peace be upon him: \"So he did not tarry to bring a roasted calf.\" And he used metonymy with the Masterpiece of Maryam for fresh dates, because in her story: \"And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you fresh, ripe dates.\"\n\"I heard\" Abu Sa'd Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Millah al-Harawi say: Al-Mubarrad passed by Sadab the paper-seller while he was at the door of his house. He rose to him and asked him to please him by entering his home and helping him with what was present. Al-Mubarrad said to him: \"What do you have?\" He said: \"My master, I have You and upon it I.\" Meaning cold meat (Mubarrad) and upon it Rue (Sadab). He laughed at it and answered him.\n\"I heard\" Abu al-Fadl Ubayd Allah bin Ahmad al-Mikali say: A Bedouin said to his wife: \"Where has your pot reached?\" She said: \"Its preacher has stood up,\" using metonymy for boiling.\n\"It was said\" to Al-Jammaz: \"Which legumes are dearer to you?\" He said: \"The wolf's legume,\" meaning meat. Some witty jurists entered upon me one day. The conversation prolonged, then he said to me: \"What is before His saying Almighty: 'We have certainly encountered from this journey of ours fatigue'?\" I said: \"Bring us our lunch.\" He said: \"Then act upon it.\" I found this anecdote witty and ordered bringing what he could eat.\n\"Al-Tabari used to\" say: If you see the boon companion suggesting that this verse be sung: \"O my two friends, you treated an apparent... So who treats an internal ardency?\" Know that he is hungry, wanting to be fed. \"He said\": And for this is a story, which is that a man entered a banquet and had severe hunger. The singer asked him about the suggestion from singing. He suggested this verse. The slave girl of the house owner realized his intent and said to her master: \"Feed the man, for he is hungry.\"\n\"It was said\" to some of them: \"Which digestive (Jawarish) is dearer to you?\" He said: \"Wheat digestive,\" meaning bread.\n\"The Sufis have\" metonymies for foods that are deemed witty, among them their saying: \"He carries the Martyr son of the Martyr\" (Wine/Bread?). And for Qata'if (pancakes) \"Graves of the Martyrs.\" And for Faludhaj \"Seal of Goodness.\" And for rice with sugar \"Sheikh Al-Tabari with the Military Shawl.\" And for Lawzinaj \"Fingers of the Houris.\"\nAl-Jahiz was eating one day with Muhammad bin Abd al-Malik al-Zayyat. A Faludhaj was brought. Muhammad teased Al-Jahiz and ordered that what slips from the bowl be placed from his side. He hastened in eating until he cleaned what was before him. Muhammad said: \"O Abu Uthman, your sky has cleared before the sky of people.\" He said: \"May Allah reform you, because its cloud was thin.\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Drink and Amusements and what is added to them\"\nThe origin in this section is the saying of the poet: \"Lo, give me the reddish wine from the milk of the vine... And do not give me 'Khamr' (Wine) with your knowledge or my knowledge. Does it not have many various names?... So bring it, give it to me, and use metonymy for that name.\"\n\"It is said\": So-and-so asked rain from the cloud of intimacy, milked the milker of joy, struck the fire stick of amusement, and rode the withers of mirth. And So-and-so seeks the blood of clusters, bleeds the veins of jars, and organizes the necklaces of brothers.\nAl-Suli narrated saying: Khallad used to report the news of Abu Hafs bin Ayyub to Ibn Tulun. Hafs said to him: \"O my master Abu al-Fadl, the gathering of wine is but the gathering of intimacy, the theatre of wish, the quieter of worry, the pasture of amusement, and the institute of joy. Or by what is by its mediation, because you are to me among those whose unseen is not accused.\"\nAl-Sahib wrote: \"Our master becomes active to take what extends joy, attracts intimacy, and expands the chest.\"\n\"Another wrote\": \"If expansion is denied in the faces of demands, what gathers the reunion of brothers and disperses types of sorrows is lawful.\"\n\"Some used metonymy\" for it with \"Elixir of Joy,\" \"Alchemy of Happiness,\" \"Antidote of Worries,\" \"Soap of Griefs,\" and \"Solder of the Wombs of the Noble.\"\n\"Another wrote\": \"We returned to the arrows of amusement so we circulated them, and to the vehicles of joy so we rode them.\"\n\"Al-Tabari mentioned\" in the book \"Al-Amthal al-Muwallada\" that it is said of the drunkard if he reaches the peak of drunkenness: \"Moses has crossed the sea.\"\nUbayd, the narrator of Al-A'sha, \"was asked\" about the meaning of Al-A'sha's saying: \"And a captive from what Babylon aged... Like the blood of the slaughtered, I robbed it of its color (Jiryal).\" He said: I asked Al-A'sha about that. He said: \"I drank it red and pissed it red.\" Jiryal is the color of wine.\n\"It is narrated\" from Al-Sha'bi that he said: I have not heard in metonymies and allusions better than what passed between Ubayd Allah and Al-Harith bin Badr. He said to him one day: \"What is this scratch on your face?\" He said: \"I fell from a sorrel horse of mine,\" meaning wine. He said: \"Where are you from the compliant grey one?\" meaning water.\n\"It is said\" in metonymy for the little drinker: \"So-and-so is a snuff-taker (Mus'iti).\" It is the saying of Ibn Lank: \"I ransom you; if you knew some of what is in me... You would not have made me swallow except with a snuff-pot. Suffice you that a vineyard in my neighborhood... I pass by its door so I almost fall.\"\nAbu Ja'far Muhammad bin Musa al-Musawi recited to me for some: \"He claims drinking in a pound (Ratl) and a large jar... While the mother of Antara al-Absi suffices him.\"",

And his heart is a hardness imitating Abu Aws.\" Meaning a stone (Hajar), so he put Abu Aws in place of the stone, and Abu Aws is (from the root) stone.\n\"Then\" Abu Muslim Muhammad bin Bahr \"mourned it\" (criticized it) to him. He wrote to him: \"Abu Hasan, you tried to bring a rhyme... Solidified in meaning, but it came to you weak. You said Abu Aws, intending metonymy for... The hard stone, so you brought a calamity. If this is permissible, then break without being small... The mouth of the Master, the Gallant, Mu'awiyah.\" Meaning Rock (Sakhr), which is the name of Abu Sufyan. \"Otherwise, we will set up between us for you a battle... So you become banned in Siffin a second time.\"\nThe talk returned to the condition of the section. Al-Tabari wrote describing a singer: \"So-and-so is the doctor of hearts and ears, and the reviver of the dead of thoughts and natures.\"\n\"Others said\": \"So-and-so feeds ears joy and ignites light in hearts.\"\nAl-Sahib wrote: \"Flags of intimacy are fluttering, and tongues of amusements are speaking.\"\n\"Abu al-Faraj al-Babbgha wrote\": \"Amusement has broken its seal, and Intimacy has spread its flags.\"\n\"Others said\": \"We have heard what lifts the veil of the ear, takes the gathering places of the heart, and mixes with the parts of the soul.\"\n\nThe Seventh Chapter\nOn Various Arts of Metonymy and Allusion\nDifferent in Arrangement\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Removal (Dismissal), Defeat, and some Sultanic Terms\"\nAl-Rashid said to Yahya bin Khalid: \"I wanted to transfer the ring which is with my brother Al-Fadl to my brother Ja'far, but I felt shy to write to him. So write to him yourself and suffice me.\" Yahya wrote to him: \"The Commander of the Faithful has seen fit to transfer the ring from your left to your right.\" He answered: \"Hearing and obedience. No blessing transferred from me that went to my brother.\"\n\"A worker wrote\" to the one replacing him, so he was gentle and witty: \"You have been entrusted with the work in your region, so may Allah congratulate you on the renewal of your mandate. I have sent my successor to your succession, so do not leave him without your guidance until Allah grants your visit.\" He answered him with these letters: \"No blessing transferred from me that went to you, nor was I empty of a honor that encompassed you. I find my dismissal by you a second mandate, and a sufficient connection from the Vizier for what I hope by your place of good ending and praiseworthy consequence.\"\n\"Of\" the terms of metonymy for dismissal: \"The sword of his competence has been sheathed,\" \"The Diwan has been vacated of his leadership,\" \"The weight of work has been lifted from him.\"\n\"Metonymy may be used\" for dismissal with 'Sarf' (Diversion/Spending), for confiscation with 'Muwaqa'ah' (falling upon/encounter), and for defeat with 'Taraju'' (Retreat) and 'Tahayyuz' (Taking side/Withdrawal). As Abu Ishaq al-Sabi wrote on behalf of Bakhtiyar to a leader of a side facing an enemy: \"If a matter befalls you that necessitates caution, you should resolve to withdraw (Tahayyuz) to the Presence, for it is paved for you, not distant from you.\"\n\"Metonymy is used\" for the riot of the army with 'Lawthah' (Confusion/Taint). As Abu al-Hasan al-Tawmi wrote on behalf of Abu Ali al-Saghawi: \"A confusion (Lawthah) has appeared from the retinue; may Allah help in rectifying and treating it.\"\n\"Metonymy is used\" for shackling (Taqyid), so it is said: \"He was secured with iron.\"\n\"It is narrated\" that Al-Hajjaj said to Al-Ghadban bin al-Qaba'thari: \"I will surely carry you on the black (Adham),\" using metonymy for shackles. He feigned stupidity and said: \"The like of the Prince carries on the black and the grey (Ashhab) (horses).\" He said: \"It is iron.\" He said: \"To be iron (sharp) is dearer to me than to be stupid (blunt).\"\n\"Metonymy is used\" for bribery with \"Pouring oil in the lamp.\" \"Perhaps\" it is called \"Qandalah\" (Lamp-ing). Yahya bin Khalid appointed over the Diwan of Tax a man from the people of Khurasan called Abu Salih. He took bribes, so he dismissed him and appointed in his place Sa'dan bin Yahya. It was said regarding him: \"Poured into the lamp of Sa'dan... With the greeting, oil. And the lamps of his sons... Before the bay horse disappears.\" So Yahya dismissed him and returned Abu Salih. It was said regarding him: \"The lamp of Sa'dan, by its light... Is a chick to the lamp of Abu Salih. You see him in his council more cross-eyed... From his glancing at the shining dirham.\"\nRegarding this metonymy, I was recited for Ibn Lank: \"I say to a group who attacked with Fiqh... And said: What is other than the possessor of knowledge is false. Yes, no knowledge is equal to your reaching... To the money of orphans and widows. I see you turning the judgment upside down... Whenever oil is poured in the lamps.\"",

    "text": "I heard Abu Zakariya Yahya bin Ismail al-Harbi say: Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, used metonymy for extracting the Kharaj (land tax), Ushr (tithe), and all rights of the Treasury by his saying: \"And make the milch camel of the Muslims flow.\" He made the flow of Fay' and Kharaj, from which are their stipends, flow by their milch camel.\n\"Of that\" is that our Master Uthman bin Affan, when he assumed the Caliphate, dismissed Amr ibn al-Aas from Egypt. He had been its governor from the day of its conquest in the Caliphate of Al-Faruq until Uthman took over. He appointed in his place Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi Sarh. He sent the Kharaj for a year: fourteen thousand thousand (14 million) dinars. Amr ibn al-Aas was present then with Uthman. Amr used to send it as thirteen thousand thousand dinars. Uthman said: \"The milch camel has flowed, O Amr.\" He said: \"Yes, O Commander of the Faithful, but you have harmed its weaning camels (young).\"\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for what is taken as Bad Omen from its Word\"\nThe stung is metonymized by \"Al-Salim\" (Safe). The blind by \"Al-Basir\" (Seer). The desert (perishing place) by \"Al-Mafazah\" (Place of winning/safety). The Angel of Death by \"Abu Yahya\" (Father of John/Lives). Al-Sahib was witty in describing two brothers, handsome and ugly, where he said: \"Yahya resembled the confused (moon?), but he has... A brother who resembled the face of Abu Yahya.\"\nThe Abyssinian is metonymized by \"Abu al-Bayda'\" (Father of the White), as the poet said: \"Abu Salih is the opposite of his name and nickname... Just as you see the Negro called Ambergris. And he is nicknamed Abu al-Bayda' while the color is pitch-black... But they came with it for (avoiding) bad omen.\"\nWhen the news reached Al-Mansur of the revolt of Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abdullah bin al-Hasan in Basra, while he was in a garden of his in Baghdad, he looked at a tree and said to Al-Rabi': \"What is the name of this tree?\" He said: \"Obedience (Ta'ah), O Commander of the Faithful.\" It was a willow (Khilaf - pun on dissent). Al-Mansur took good omen from that and wondered at his intelligence.\n\"Parallel\" to this metonymy, even if not in its meaning, is what is told that a man passed in the courtyard of Al-Rashid's palace with a bundle of bamboo (Khayzuran). Al-Rashid said to Al-Fadl bin al-Rabi': \"What is that?\" He said: \"Roots of spears, O Commander of the Faithful.\" He hated to say \"Khayzuran\" because it matched the name of Al-Rashid's mother.\n\"As for\" metonymy for what should not be metonymized, there is a story here mentioned by Ibn Abdus in the Book of Viziers and Scribes. He said that the names of a group of scribes were presented to Al-Mutawakkil to be invested with works. Among those presented to him was the name of Tamas bin Akhi Ibrahim bin al-Abbas. He struck it out and said: \"He is not appointed nor honored, for he uses metonymy for Cupping (Hijama).\" He calls the sun \"Al-Adwah\" (The Enemy). He uses metonymy for the snake with \"Al-Tawilah\" (The Long One), and for the Jinn with \"Ammar al-Dar\" (Inhabitants of the House).\n\n\"Section on Metonymy for Grooming the Body\"\nI heard Al-Tabari say: I was one day before Sayf al-Dawla in Aleppo. A cousin of his entered upon him. The Prince deemed him slow and said to him: \"Where were you today and with what were you busy?\" He said: \"May Allah support our Master, I shaved my head, fixed my hair, and clipped my nails.\" He said to him: \"(If) you said: 'I took from my ends', it would have been more concise and eloquent.\" Better than this is the saying of Allah Almighty: \"Then let them end their untidiness (Tafath).\" Abu Mansur al-Azhari said in the book \"Tahdhib al-Lugha\": None of the linguists interpreted Tafath as Al-Nadr bin Shumayl interpreted it, as he made Tafath (to be) dishevelment (Sha'ath), and made its ending its removal by entering the bathhouse, shaving, taking from the hair, plucking the armpit, and shaving the pubic hair.\n\"Of the subtleties\" of doctors is their metonymies for diarrhea with \"Istifragh\" (Evacuation) and for vomiting with \"Ta'aluj\" (Treatment).\n\"I found\" in the handwriting of Abu al-Hasan al-Salami in a notebook of his selected poetry he gifted to Abu al-Hasan Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Karkhi, innovative verses of his in metonymy for depilatory paste (Nura): \"When he grew a beard, his black turban became... Imitating the circle of the jaw. So he began plotting or softening... To shave the hair from his buttocks or attack. Every day you see him wrapped... In the garden between the pools and ponds. We did not know that he is a moon... Until he was clothed in a piece of the firmament (Falak - pun on sky/basin).\"\n\n\"Section on what deviated from this Chapter of Metonymies in the reports of the Prophet, peace be upon him\"",

    "text": "\"It is narrated\" from Abu Umamah from Aisha, may Allah Almighty be pleased with her, that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"None of you should say: My soul has become bad (Khabuthat). Let him say: My soul has become nauseous (Laqisat).\"\n\"It is narrated\" that Banu Qurayzah and Ka'b bin Asad, when they contracted with the Prophet, peace be upon him, for a truce, he accepted it from them. When it was the Year of the Trench, Huyayy bin Akhtab came to them and incited them to break the covenants, so they broke them. The news came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, so he sent men to find out the news. He said to them: \"If it is true, then hint it to me with a hint I know, and do not break the arms of the people. And if they are upon loyalty, then declare it and announce it.\" They came to them, and they burned their book upon which they contracted with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. The people returned and said: \"Adal and Al-Qarah,\" using metonymy that they betrayed as Adal and Al-Qarah betrayed. They are Banu al-Hawn bin Khuzaimah. They came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and said: \"There is Islam in us by the Messenger of Allah, so send to us a group of your companions to teach us.\" He sent with them seven men, their leader Marthad. When they were at Batn al-Raji', a water for Banu Hudhayl, the Adalis said to Marthad: \"Stay until we find a place for you.\" They went until they came to Banu Lihyan and said: \"These are a group of the companions of Muhammad. We guide you to them on condition that what you obtain from this is between us and you.\" They said: \"Yes.\" Some of them preferred themselves (surrendered) and some refused, so they killed those who did not surrender. This is the story of Adal and Al-Qarah.\nThe companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, when they sat with him, it was as if birds were on their heads. Hassan sprang one day and recited to him the saying of Al-A'sha: \"Both your parents - the branch was a support... But they increased and I became decreasing. You spend the night in winter full of your bellies... While your female neighbors are hungry, spending the night empty-bellied.\" The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to him: \"Do not recite the satire of Alqama, for Abu Sufyan riled me up (Shaghaba minni) before Heraclius, so Alqama went west (Gharroba) upon him.\" Hassan said: \"O Messenger of Allah, whoever your hand reached, his thanks is obligatory upon us.\" Nothing has been heard in metonymy for slander better than his saying \"Shaghaba minni\", nor in metonymy for denial and protest like his saying \"Gharroba alayhi\", nor in apology like Hassan's saying \"Whoever your hand reached, his thanks is obligatory upon us.\"\n\n\"Section on the Opposite of Metonymy\"\nIts meaning is uglifying the beautiful, just as the meaning of metonymy is beautifying the ugly. Some wits \"entered\" a vineyard and looked at the unripe grapes (Hisrim). He said: \"O Allah, blacken his face, cut his neck, and give me his blood to drink.\" It is said that Sulayman ibn Kathir said it, and the mention of Abu Muslim al-Khurasani had run before him. The talk was reported to Abu Muslim, so he admonished him for it. He denied having said it about him. Abu Muslim said: \"The trustworthy informed me about you regarding this.\" He said: \"Yes, I said it, but in vineyard such-and-such when I looked at the unripe grapes. Ask the narrator about that. If he mentions to you the story of the vineyard, believe me. If he mentions to you that I said it in a place other than the vineyard, then the matter is as you thought.\" Someone who did not give it its due versified this prose when he said: \"I passed by a cluster of vineyard hanging... Dripping wetness one day, and it was unripe. So I said: May Allah show me your face blackened... And may I be given to drink, O cluster, from your hollow, the blood.\"\n\"Ibn Mukarram passed\" by Abu al-Ayna' who was on a prayer rug of his. He wanted to sit on it with him. He said: \"You cannot fit on my prayer rug.\" He said: \"Rather, it is a rolling place for a cat (Sinnawr - pun on Fasq/sin?).\"\n\"When\" Sa'id bin Humayd was appointed over the Diwan of Post at the Presence, Abu Ali al-Basir said about him: \"By my father! The soul of Sa'id... Indeed, it is a noble soul. He ceased not to trick until... He became the Winker (Ghammaz) of the Caliph.\"\n\n\"Section on what deviated from the Book of Metonymies of the people of Baghdad\"\n\"They use metonymy\" for the beard with \"Beauties\" (Mahasin). They say to one who has a mote in his beard: \"Your hand on your beauties.\"\n\"They use metonymy\" for decoration with \"Shatmah\" (Insult) with Zay (Zatmah/Zaymah?). Some people of the age said: \"A friend of ours whom Time clothed... With clothes of wealth raising his status. We see him thick of speech temperament... If pride broke his eyelids. He addresses his brothers with Kaf... And insults his boys with Zay.\"\n\"They say\" regarding one who is mocked while not knowing: \"He danced in his boat.\"\n\"They pray\" against one whom they visit repeatedly saying: \"May Allah empower over him what ruminates,\" meaning the lion.\nThey use metonymy for the pimp with \"Al-Naqib\" (The Captain/Leader). Al-Sahib said: \"O Ibn Ya'qub, O Captain of Moons... Be my intercessor to a happy youth. Say to him that beauty has a Zakat... So give it in charity to the abandoned.\"\n\n\"Section on Arts of Allusions\"",

    "text": "The Arabs use allusion (Ta'rid) in their speech, so they reach their will in a way that is subtler and better than revealing and declaring. They fault a man if he reveals in every way. They say: \"So-and-so does not improve allusion except as slander.\" Allah made it permissible in proposing to women, saying: \"There is no blame upon you for that to which you [indirectly] allude concerning a proposal to women or for what you conceal within yourselves.\" He did not permit declaration. Allusion in proposal is to say to the woman: \"By Allah, indeed you are beautiful, and indeed you are young, and perhaps Allah will provide you a righteous husband, and indeed women are of my needs,\" and similar speech.\n\"Some philologists narrated\" that a group of Bedouins went out to gather provisions. When they returned, a man sneaked at night to the sack of his companion, took it, and put it in his sack. When he wanted to depart and they stood to help each other load (Ta'akama), he saw his sack rising light and his companion's sack tipping and heavy. He recited saying: \"A sack ate the dinner of some of the people's sacks... I have not seen a thieving sack before today.\"\n\"From\" Sa'id bin Jubayr from Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, regarding His saying, Great and Glorious, narrating about Moses, peace be upon him: \"Do not blame me for what I forgot.\" He said: He did not forget, but it was from the allusions of speech. Ibn Abbas meant that he did not say \"Indeed I forgot\" so he would be a liar, but he said \"Do not blame me for what I forgot\" making him imagine forgetfulness as an allusion.\n\"Sharik al-Numayri rode with\" Umar bin Hubayrah al-Fazari on a mule. It passed Umar's palfrey. Umar said to him: \"Lower its rein (control/gaze).\" Sharik said: \"It is Maktuba (Written/Destined - pun).\" Umar intended the saying of the poet: \"So lower the gaze, indeed you are from Numayr... You reached neither Ka'b nor Kilab.\" Sharik intended the saying of the other: \"Do not trust a Fazari you are alone with... On your young she-camel, and write it with straps.\"\n\"A Tamimi and a Numayri met\" in a gathering and waded with the waders. The Tamimi said: \"I like the falcon among birds of prey.\" The Numayri said: \"Especially if it hunts the sandgrouse (Qata).\" The Tamimi only intended the saying of the poet: \"I am the falcon overlooking Numayr... Allowed from the sky for it is the pouring.\" The Numayri intended the saying of Al-Tirimmah: \"Tamim knocks on meanness, more guided than the sandgrouse... And if it walked the paths of noble deeds, it would get lost.\"\n\"A man from Muharib entered\" upon Abdullah bin Yazid al-Hilali while he was in Armiliyah. Abdullah said: \"What did we encounter last night from the Sheikhs of Muharib! They did not let us sleep,\" meaning frogs. He intends the saying of Al-Akhtal: \"Croak with nothing, Sheikhs of Muharib... I did not think them to be feathered nor sharpened. Frogs in the darkness of night responded to each other... So the water snake was guided to them by their voice.\" He said: \"May Allah reform you, they lost a veil (Burqu') last night, so they were searching for it.\" He intends the saying of the poet: \"For every Hilali there is a shield from meanness... And for Ibn Yazid there is a veil and housings.\"\n\"Of allusions by deed\" is what is narrated that Mu'awiyah sent speech to Amr ibn al-Aas. He said to the messenger: \"Look what he returns to you.\" When he spoke, Amr bit his thumb until the messenger finished, and did not add to that. When he returned to Mu'awiyah, he informed him of his deed. Mu'awiyah said to him: \"What did he intend?\" He said: \"I do not know.\" He said: \"He only said: Do you scold me while I chew the bit of a strong horse?\"\n\"Al-Fadl\" bin al-Rabi' was impugned in his lineage because Al-Rabi' was a slave (Mamluk), but he attributed himself to Yunus bin Muhammad bin Abi Farwah, client of Uthman. That is because a slave girl of Yunus gave birth to Al-Rabi', and Yunus denied him. When he grew up, he sold him. Conditions and ownerships turned him until Ziyad bin Abdullah al-Harithi, maternal uncle of Al-Saffah, bought him. When he saw his intelligence and literature, he gifted him to Al-Mansur. When he freed him and favored him, it reached him that he attributes himself to Yunus. He disciplined him and said: \"I freed you and chose you, then you claim the clientage of Uthman?\" For this story, Ja'far bin Yahya nicknamed Al-Fadl bin al-Rabi' \"Abu Ruh\" because the foundling is metonymized by it. The people of Medina call the foundling \"Farkh\" (Chick), and it is with them a chick of adultery. It is told that Al-Rashid was eating one day with Ja'far. Three chicks were placed for him. Al-Rashid said to Ja'far joking: \"Divide them for equality in my eating.\" He said: \"A division of justice or injustice?\" He said: \"A division of justice.\" Ja'far took two chicks and left one. Al-Rashid said to him: \"Is this justice?\" He said: \"Yes, with you are two chicks, and with me are two chicks.\" He said: \"Then where is the other?\" He said: \"This,\" and pointed to Al-Fadl bin al-Rabi' who was standing at his head. Al-Rashid smiled and said: \"O Fadl, if you held fast to our clientage, this would fall from you.\" Al-Fadl did not understand what they said except after a while.\nIt is narrated that a man from Banu Fazara threw a blue ring to a man from Banu Dabbah. The Dabbi tied a strap on it and returned it to him. He only intended the saying of Al-Fazari the poet: \"Your eyes were endowed, O son of Muka'bar... Just as every Dabbi is blue from meanness.\" \"Do not trust a Fazari you are alone with... On your young she-camel, and write it with straps.\"",

    "text": "\"Abu Ali al-Salami mentioned\" in the book \"Nutaf al-Turaf\" that Abdullah bin Tahir appointed some of his cousins over Marw. Its people complained of him. A group of them came as a delegation to Abdullah and complained to him and spoke much about him. He thought they were exaggerating against him, so he did not dismiss him. When they left, some Sheikhs there said: \"I will suffice you of him.\" He arrived at Abdullah, who asked him about the condition of the country. He informed of calm and tranquility. Then he asked him about the news of their governor. He described him with virtue, literature, and what the Prince gathers of lineage, and exaggerated in mentioning the good. Then he said: \"Except that he...\" and pecked with his finger on his head a peck (Naqrah), meaning he is light-brained. Abdullah said: \"What have governors to do with recklessness? Console him.\" So he dismissed him. The Sheikh returned to Marw and informed them that he dismissed him with a peck (Naqrah).\nI heard Abu Nasr Sahl bin al-Marzuban say: A son was born to Ibn Mukarram, so Abu al-Ayna' came to him congratulating. When he left, he left a stone behind him, alluding that the child belongs to the bed (Firash) and for the adulterer is the stone (Hajar).\n\"Ibn Abdus recounted\" in the book of Viziers and Scribes that Sulayman bin Wahb was in charge of Kharaj and Estates in Egypt, and Al-Husayn the Servant, known as 'Arq al-Mawt' (Sweat of Death), was in charge of the Post there. He attended one day with Al-Husayn, and he used to joke with him much. He called for a Sikbajiyya soup (vinegar stew), and it was brought. When he drank it, he said: \"O boy, bring me a toothpick (Khilal).\" Those present wondered at his request for a toothpick after the soup. He only alluded to Al-Husayn the Servant, indicating that servants (eunuchs), if they age, make toothpicks. Al-Husayn said: \"O boy, bring us two toothpicks (Khilalayn),\" and placed one of his index fingers on the other like the shape of a cross, alluding to Sulayman that he was a Christian, and he was accused of collusion with Christians.\nAnd Allah Glory be to Him, the Exalted, knows best.\nThen the Book of the End in that Metonymy...\nAnd may Allah bless our Master Muhammad and his family and companions and grant peace.",
