    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. May Allah, the Exalted, send blessings upon our master Muhammad and all his family.\nMay Allah increase your desire for literature and love for knowledge, guide you to the proof, lead you to the clear path, help you in your quest with rectitude, and grant you success in achieving your goal upon inquiry.\nYou asked me, may Allah strengthen you, to record for you verses of vivid similes from poets and their witty innovations therein. People, may Allah strengthen you, have preceded us in selecting poetry and distinguishing it, but they did not categorize it into chapters. This is because poetry is divided into three types:\nFrom it is the proverb (Mathal) that circulates, like the saying of Al-Akhtal:\n'Glory swore truly it would not ally with them ... Until the ten fingers ally with the palm of the hand.'\nAnd like the saying of Al-Farazdaq:\n'As for the enemy, we do not soften for him ... Until the stone softens for the chewer's molar.'\nAnd from it is the strange metaphor (Isti'arah), like the saying of Al-Tirimmah:\n'So I said to her, O mother of Bayda', indeed ... My youth has been spilled and my skin has withered.'\nAnd like the saying of Al-Hutay'ah:\n'They competed with you, so they revealed from their quivers ... Ancient glory and arrows that are not reversed.'\nAnd from it is the vivid, rare simile (Tashbih), like the saying of Imru' al-Qays regarding the eagle:\n'As if the hearts of birds, wet and dry ... At her nest, are jujubes and withered dates.'\nAnd like the saying of Adi ibn al-Riqa' in describing the wild bull:\n'He drives a nasal-sounding (female), as if the tip of his horn ... Is a pen that took from the inkwell its ink.'\nWhatever falls outside these three categories is mediocre or inferior speech with no benefit or utility.\nI saw the most majestic of these types and the most difficult for its creator is the simile. That is because it only occurs to one whose contemplation is prolonged, whose sense is refined, and who distinguishes between things with his subtle thought. I will record for you in this book selected verses of simile, and I will intersperse the different meanings and common similes with rare and witty verses. I will limit myself to a collection in which you will find enjoyment, pleasure, education, and exercise, avoiding prolongation that is met with boredom. I will follow this with a book on proverbs and a book on metaphor. And through Allah is power and strength.\nWe begin in the name of Allah with the similes of the Creator of things, Mighty and Majestic, in His Book, for He is the most perfect witness and clearest proof. Among what He likened physical objects to is His saying, Mighty and Majestic: 'And the moon, We have measured for it mansions until it returned like the old date stalk.' And His saying, Mighty and Majestic: 'Its spathes are like the heads of devils.' And His saying: 'As if they were rubies and coral.' And 'As if they were hidden eggs.' And His saying regarding the simile of actions: 'But those who disbelieved – their deeds are like a mirage in a lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing.' And His saying: 'The example of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day.' Examples like this are numerous in the Qur'an. And in Allah we seek help for every pursuit.\nThe Arabs, may Allah support you, make similes using 'ka-anna' (as if), like the saying of Imru' al-Qays:\n'As if the eyes of the wild beasts around our tent ... And our saddles are onyx that has not been pierced.'\nAnd using 'ka-man' (like who), like the saying of Aws ibn Hajar:\n'For indeed you two, O sons of Janab, you found ... Like one who crept hiding while a bell was on his neck.'\nAnd using the Kaf (like), like his saying:\n'And a fire like the magic of the oud, its light is raised ... With the night by the gusts of cold winds.'\nAnd using 'Mithl' (like/similar), like the saying of Al-Salami:\n'Like the one whose family thinks she is ... A virgin maiden while she is in the ninth (month of pregnancy).'\nAnd using 'Ka-ma' (just as), like the saying of Ka'b ibn Zuhair:\n'She does not hold to the promise she made ... Except as water holds sieves.'\nAnd using 'Ka-mithl' (like the likeness of), 'Ka-amthal' (like the likes of), 'Takhalu' (you imagine), 'Tazunnu' (you think), 'Takadu' (almost), and the like. Also by hiding one of these particles if the poet cannot maintain the meter by showing it, like his saying:\n'I rose to her after her family slept ... The rising of water bubbles, state upon state.'\nHe meant 'Like the rising of water bubbles.'\nChapter (2) On the Pleiades (Al-Thurayya)\nAmong the beautiful similes is the saying of Imru' al-Qays regarding the Pleiades:\n'When the Pleiades appeared in the sky ... Like the appearance of the folds of a detailed sash.'\nA group of poets likened it, hitting the mark or coming close. Among that is the saying of Ibn al-Tathriyyah:\n'When the Pleiades are in the sky as if they are ... Pearls that fell from their string and scattered.'\nAnother said in this meaning:\n'When I reached, and the Pleiades were as if they were ... A necklace of pearls whose string was pulled.'\nAnother said:\n'And the Pleiades appeared to its night traveler as if ... At the western side, they were a chained earring.'\nAli ibn al-Abbas al-Rumi said similar to it:\n'I sipped his saliva after midnight ... While the Pleiades on the western side were an earring.'\nDhu al-Rumma said describing a land he crossed:\n'I arrived at it traversing blindly while the Pleiades were as if ... On the top of the head, a bird circling over water.'\n'Its Aldebaran crawls on its tracks ... So neither is it outstripped nor does it catch up.'",

    "text": "Abu Qays ibn al-Aslat said:\n'And the Pleiades appeared in the morning to the one who sees ... Like a bunch of white grapes when it blossoms.'\nIbrahim ibn al-Mahdi followed him and described a land he crossed, saying:\n'I traversed it while the Pleiades star was humble ... As if it were a bunch of grapes in the skin of the night.'\nAl-Mubarrad recited:\n'When the Pleiades appear in the sky ... The sharp-eyed sees them as seven stars.'\n'On the liver of the sky (Al-Jarba'), and they are as if they are ... A splint of pearls mounted on a wrist.'\nHe likened it to a wide bracelet (Dastinj).\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'As if the Pleiades in the late part of its night ... Are the opening of blossoms or a silver-inlaid bridle.'\nHe also said:\n'So hand it to me, while the Pleiades are as if they are ... The harvest of narcissus which the cupbearer gifted to the boon companions.'\nIbn al-Rumi likened it to a white foot, mentioning a woman's hair:\n(Munsarih Meter)\n'The coverings of her locks cover a foot ... White, capable for the onlookers.'\n'Like the Pleiades when they appear at dawn ... After clouds, and a remover removed it.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz took it and added, saying:\n'And I see the Pleiades in the sky as if they are ... A foot appearing from mourning clothes.'\nThe Arabs call the Pleiades 'Al-Najm' (The Star). They recite regarding its rising in winter:\n'Drinking wine became pleasant when ... The Star rose in the evening.'\n'And the shepherd sought for his winter ... A cloak against the cold.'\nAnother said regarding its rising in summer:\n'The Star rose early in the morning ... So the shepherd sought his small waterskin.'\nKa'b al-Ghanawi said regarding Gemini (Al-Jawza'):\n'And Gemini leaned until it was as if it were ... Tents of riders descending in the desert.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'As if Gemini in the highest horizon ... Are branches of blossoms or a sash of leaves.'\nAl-Dulfi said regarding the stars in general:\n'When the sky is a garden ... Its stars are like flowers.'\n'And the atmosphere is pure ... Not muddied by the spreading of dust.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'As if our sky, when it revealed ... Through its stars at the morning.'\n'Are gardens of violet whose dew is moist ... Between which the blossoms of chamomile open.'\nImru' al-Qays said:\n'I looked at it and the stars were as if they were ... Lamps of monks lit for a return journey.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'As if the stars of the night in the coal-black darkness ... Are heads of pins fixed in veils.'\nAbd al-Aziz ibn Abdullah ibn Tahir said:\n'And Sirius intercepted the middle of the sky ... As if it were a ruby in a comb.'\nAbu Nuwas likened the dirham to it, saying:\n'I describe a falcon that defeats falcons ... Victorious, white, round.'\n'You imagine it in its size to be Sirius.'\nAnother said:\n'It delights my eye to see in his place ... Canopus (Suhayl) like the glance of the squint-eyed looking arrogantly.'\nJarran al-Awd said:\n'I watch a glimpse of Canopus as if it ... When it appears at the end of the night, blinks.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'As if Canopus is the figure of a thirsty person leaning ... From the night into a pool of the earth drinking.'\nAnother said:\n'When Sirius the Crosser (Al-Abur) was as if it were ... A suspended lamp upon which are churches.'\n'And Canopus appeared from afar as if it were ... A flame which a fire-starter turns away from the wind.'\nAbdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And Canopus appeared to the night traveler as if it were ... Upon every star in the sky a watcher.'\nAl-Alawi al-Isbahani said:\n'As if Canopus, while the stars are in front of him ... Are opposed by a shepherd behind a herd.'\n'When he stood from his squatting, you said a monk ... Prolonged standing after a long bowing.'\nAl-Alawi said regarding Vega (Al-Nasr al-Waqi'):\n'And a rider of three like the tripod stones took turns ... On the darkness of the night until the light of dawn flashed.'\n'If they gather, you name them with the name of one ... And if they separate, they will not be known till the end of time.'\nAl-Ta'i recited:\n'And the daughters of Na'sh (Ursa Major) appeared and loomed ... Like a bier (Na'sh) upon which is a new garment.'\n'And as if Gemini, when it rose ... And hung down, was an extended canopy.'\nAl-Alawi al-Isbahani said:\n'And the stars of Gemini extend their arm ... To embrace the darkness while bidding farewell.'\n'And as if they are in the air the bier of a brother of decay ... Weeping, stopping at times, and escorting.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding the inclining of the Pleiades:\n'And the Pleiades inclined to the West ... Just as the fearful one inclined to the sound.'\n'As if its stars, while dawn is appearing ... To our eyes, are sick women recovering.'\nIbn al-Zubayr al-Asadi said regarding that:",

    "text": "'And the Pleiades pierced the West as if ... They were therein a white banner lowered for stabbing.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said similar to it:\n'And the Star fell and Gemini followed it ... Like one with an earring she turned and it fell.'\nHe also has regarding Al-Ayyuq (Capella):\n'And the Pleiades desire ... In setting a desire.'\n'Like the falling of the high-bred horse ... Almost dropping the bridle.'\nAnd he has, 'And he gave me wine to drink while the night was wrapped in the morning':\n'And the Pleiades were like the blossoms of a branch scattered on the West.'\nAbu al-Najm said regarding the sun's inclining to set:\n'Until when the evening revealed it clearly ... Between the sides of a frightening twilight.'\n'It is on the horizon like the eye of the cross-eyed ... Inclined, it almost did but did not yet do.'\nHe also said:\n'A hunter poured upon him when he was heedless ... And the sun was like a mirror in the hand of the paralyzed.'\nAl-Alawi al-Isbahani said:\n'And a drinking gathering I came to seeking joy ... At evening, while the eye of the sun in the horizon was dozing.'\nIbn al-Rumi said in this meaning:\n'As if the inclination of the sun then its setting ... While it started to sicken in the wing of the night.'\n'Is the squinting of an eye whose eyelids drowsiness ... Muddies sleep in them while it closes.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'The sun continues to glance at us with a look ... Sick, exhausted, from behind a curtain.'\n'Trying to tear a cloud while it refuses ... Like an impotent man wanting to marry a virgin.'\nRegarding the rising of the sun from between the clouds, Ibn al-Rumi says:\n'And the day is cloudy so its sun ... In it is rising and veiled.'\n'It continued to play hide and seek with us while sending ... A light that watches us without flame.'\nDhu al-Rumma said describing a woman:\n'She shows you the whiteness of her lock and a face ... Like the horn of the sun that broke through then moved.'\n'It hit a gap so it appeared dim ... No, but the rest of it was inserted deeply.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding the sunset:\n'When the afternoon sun was patched and shook ... Upon the western horizon a trembling saffron.'\n'And bid farewell to the world to fulfill its vow ... And the rest of its life diminished and became thin.'\n'And it glanced at the blossoms while it was sick ... Having placed a cheek on the earth submitting.'\n'Just as the eye of an exhausted person glances at his visitors ... Pained by his ailments what he is pained by.'\n'And the eyes of the blossoms remained wet with dew ... As the eye of the sad person welled up to shed tears.'\n'And between the fainting of separation upon them both ... As if they were two pure friends bidding farewell.'\nAnother said regarding the halo of the sun:\n'And the sun appearing, moving as if it were ... A shield kissed by a brave lancer.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding the crescent moon:\n'I did not taste the taste of sleep, if only you knew ... As if my insides were on embers.'\n'From a moon showing half of itself ... As if it were a burner of perfume.'\nHe also said:\n'Welcome to a Fitr whose crescent has shone ... So now go early to the wine and be early.'\n'And look at it like a boat of silver ... Burdened by a load of ambergris.'\nAnother said:\n'And the light of the full moon appeared at the end of a night ... On a peak as if it were half a bracelet.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a night:\n'The waning ate its crescent ... Until it appeared like the curvature of ivory.'\nTha'lab recited to us:\n(Mutaqarib Meter)\n'As if the son of its cloud was a demon ... Appearing at the horizon from a little finger.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And he came to me in the shirt of the night hiding ... Hurrying the step out of fear and caution.'\n'And the light of a crescent appeared, almost exposing him ... Like the clipping cut from a fingernail.'\nHe also said:\n'When the crescent separated from its night ... It became to one who sees and describes it.'\n'As if it were a dark man whose beard turned gray.'\nAl-Alawi al-Isbahani said:\n'What is with the crescent emaciated in the west ... Like the Nun (letter) written with gilded water.'\nAl-Najim said:\n'And a blamer dirtied my name when ... He blamed at dawn, what a dirtying.'\n'I said to him: You woke me for wine ... So bring it and be fond of rebuking.'\n'And the full moon has faced me rising ... As if it were a slice of melon.'\n'And its saffron smeared the wall ... When it rose, what a smearing.'\nAbu al-Askar recited to me:\n'And a people, they were kings, I guided them ... In a desert where no star light appears.'\n'Nor a moon except small as if it were ... The clipping of the fingernail of the dyed girl.'\nChapter (3) On the Clarity of Morning\nFrom the beautiful similes regarding the clarity of morning is the saying of Dhu al-Rumma:",

    "text": "'And there appeared to the night traveler who completed the journey ... At the ends of the night, a famous opening.'\n'Like the horse with a white belly standing ... The saddle cloth tilted from him and the color is blond.'\nHe likened the mixing of light with darkness to the horse with a white belly, which is 'Al-Anbat'.\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a cupbearer who makes the napkin from him ... In the place of the sword's long suspenders.'\n'He went early while the morning under the night was appearing ... Like a blond horse casting off the saddle cloths.'\nAbu al-Farah recited:\n'They spent the most pleasant night until appeared ... A morning that became clear like the blaze-faced blond horse.'\n'So they clung together at separation out of passion ... The clinging of the creditor to the excess of the helmet's cloth.'\nFrom Andalusian similes is the saying of Abu Yusuf al-Ramadi:\n'And a night of intimacy whose darkness we illuminated ... With stars of wine shining so they are sipped.'\n'Until the light of morning appeared as if ... Luqman departed and Joseph arrived.'\nHumayd ibn Thawr said:\n'And you see the morning as if in it is an unsheathed ... Sword carried by a blond horse.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And nothing startled us except the morning as if it were ... Coverings of Coptic linen on a swimming rose-colored horse.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'As if the pillar of morning is a neck and upper chest ... Behind the darkness from a free woman of color, unveiled.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And the morning follows Jupiter as if it were ... A naked man walking in the darkness with a lamp.'\nAl-Alawi al-Isbahani said:\n'And the dawn in the clarity of the air is rose-colored ... Like wine radiating in glass.'\nHe also has:\n'As if the clearing of night from the face of its morning ... Is the fading of dye that was covering whiteness.'\nDhu al-Rumma said with beautiful metaphor:\n'She stayed in it until the wood withered in the earth ... And the dawn dragged the Pleiades in its sheet.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'So I stood up and the night, the morning clears it as ... Smiling cleared the bright front teeth.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'When the horizon of light became bare ... Like the smiling of the dark-lipped mouth.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding a black woman:\n(Munsarih Meter)\n'As if she, while joking makes her laugh ... Is a night whose darkness was bared from a dawn.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'Your smiling while colors are eclipsed became ... The smiling of morning in dark gloom.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'I may leave early on lean horses ... While morning has shone or has not shone.'\n'Until it appeared in its saffron-dyed robe ... And its star like the bright lamp.'\n'As if it were the blaze of a blond colt.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'I may leave early while morning in its darkness ... Is like the fringe of the cloak on its fold.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Until the light of a splitting morning appeared ... Like the appearance of gray hair in the parting of the head.'\nAl-Shamardal ibn Sharik said:\n'And the light of morning appeared so we distinguished ... Just as you saw the oiled parting.'\nAnother said:\n'When the night, the morning in it was ... A split like the parting of the oiled head.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Until the morning appeared from a veil ... As the blade appeared from a scabbard.'\nHe also said:\n'And the dawn lifted the darkness as if it were ... A male ostrich upon eggs whose side was uncovered.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'When the morning appeared from its veil ... Like the appearance of the gray-haired from his robe.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Until the morning appeared from the veil ... Like gray hair descending upon youth.'\nHe also said:\n'When the light of morning cleared and opened ... The clearing of purity from under turbidity.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'I may leave early while the night in its sanctuary ... Camping in the flowers of its stars.'\n'And the morning has begun in its skin ... Leaving it with the sides of its chest.'\n'The leaving of the guardian the back of his orphan.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'I may leave early while the night in its hide ... Is like the Abyssinian fleeing from his companions.'\n'And the morning has uncovered its canine teeth ... As if it is laughing at his leaving.'\nHe also has:\n'As for the darkness, when its shirt thinned ... It showed the whiteness of morning like the polished sword.'\nHe also said:\n'And I followed the rain whose clouds drip ... While the morning is confused like the eye of the blue-eyed.'\nHe also said:\n(Munsarih Meter)\n'Do you not see the dawn under its night ... Like a kindler who spent the night blowing charcoal.'\nDescribing horses, he said:\n'So they arrived before the early morning ... While the western horizon has redness.'\n'As if it were the eyelids of the eye of the ophthalmic.'\nHe also has:\n'Until I saw the night in the horizons with black locks.'",

    "text": "'And as if it were, when it appeared in the East, the line of a mustache.'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding the blackness of the night:\n'To you we tore the wing of a night as if ... The lands had applied kohl from it with antimony.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'Explain to me how you came to my sanctuary ... While the eyelid of the night is kohled with pitch.'\nAnother said:\n'And the night threw its chest upon him ... As if its blackness was the color of ink.'\nAbd al-Samad ibn al-Mu'adhdhal said, and it is beautiful metaphor:\n(Mutaqarib Meter)\n'I say while the wing of darkness is felted ... And the night has a hand in every valley.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'And a desert like the sky I crossed ... While the night had dyed the pebbles with black.'\nHe also said:\n'She visited us while the night was dark as if it were ... Two wings of a crow from which he shook off the rain.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'O many a night like the wing of the raven ... I waded through before the rising of the sun.'\nHe also said:\n'O many a night black of cloak ... Wrapped in the wings of a crow.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'And a night like the bride's gown I donned ... With four, while the figure in the eye is one.'\n'A black Alafi (camel), a white sharp sword ... A reddish-white Mahri (camel), and a noble magnificent man.'\nAl-Buhturi said similar to it:\n'O my two friends in the midday heat from Ma'n ... ibn Awf and Buhtar ibn 'Atud.'\n'Seek a third other than me for I am ... The fourth of the reddish-white camels, the darkness, and the deserts.'\nChapter (4) On the Chameleon\nFrom the beautiful simile with the chameleon is the saying of Dhu al-Rumma describing a land:\n'And a barren, waterless desert where crouched ... The dusts of summer from every side.'\n'As if the hands of its chameleon, sunning itself ... Are the hands of a sinner asking Allah for forgiveness, repenting.'\nThe chameleon is a small animal resembling the lizard that comes to a tree known as the Tandub and similar branching trees, holds two branches of the tree with its hands, and faces the eye of the sun. Whenever the eye of the sun moves from a stem, the chameleon lets go of it and holds another stem until the sun sets, then it hides. Regarding that is the saying of Abu Du'ad al-Iyadi:\n'How was a chameleon of a Tandub tree available to her ... Not releasing a leg (branch) except holding a leg.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding a songstress:\n'What is the matter with her, she has become beautiful while her watcher ... Is always ugly, may watchers be ugly.'\n'That is only because she is the sun of the forenoon ... Her watcher is always the chameleon.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'While the chameleon's color began to yellow ... And its dewlaps turn green from the heat of the midday.'\n'And it stretches with the palms until it is as if it is ... A brother of wickedness whom his crucifier raised on the trunk.'\nAbdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a desert in which are eggs of sandgrouse, broken ... As if they are flasks in the nests.'\n'As if its chameleon, while the sun melts it ... Is a heater who approached the flame of the fire, cold.'\nFrom good metaphor in it is the saying of Dhu al-Rumma:\n'The chameleon prays in it to the sun, standing ... On the trunk, except that he does not say Takbir.'\n'If the afternoon shifted the shadow, you saw him ... Inclining (Hanif), and at the horn of forenoon he triumphs.'\nHe informed that it turns facing the sun wherever it turned.\nAl-Buhturi said regarding Babak when he was crucified:\n'Overlooking the sun, erected for it ... At the ends of the trunk like the chameleon.'\nChapter (5) On the Crucified\nThe poets have likened the crucified person frequently. Among the best of what was said in that is what Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Ukhaytil al-Wasiti, known as Barquqa, recited to us describing the day of separation:\n'As if he were a lover who extended his reach ... On the day of farewell to bid farewell to a departing one.'\n'Or one standing from drowsiness, having laziness ... Persisting in his stretching from sloth.'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding Babak:\n'He gifted to the back of the trunk his back, thus ... Does one who loathed the back of the tawny spear.'\n'High, as if the trunk pulls his arm ... And his height is from humiliation and lowness.'\n'No ankle is lower in position than his ankle ... Even though he is high above every ankle.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'There was for him in the atmosphere a rope he measures ... Whenever a rope ended, a rope was made available for him.'\n'He embraces the breaths of winds at dawn ... The farewell of departure for which no saddle is prepared.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'And it healed the vitals from their intensity ... That Babak became the neighbor of Maziyar.'\nIn Al-Miftah after his saying: 'And it healed':\n'His second in the liver of the sky, and he was not ... Like the second of two when they were in the cave.'\n'Black of clothes as if wove for them ... The hands of the hot wind armors of pitch.'",

    "text": "'They went early and traveled on the backs of standing horses (crucifixes) ... Which were led for them from the stable of the carpenter.'\n'They do not leave, and whoever sees them thinks them ... Always on a journey of journeys.'\nFollowing this in metaphor is the saying of Muslim:\n'And the head of Mihran, you mounted its peak ... A supple (spear) that sufficed him instead of the neck and throat.'\n'He continued to be harsh with grace and despise it ... Until a wood rose with him upon a wood.'\n'You placed him where the wind doubts him ... And the hyenas of the desert envy the birds regarding him.'\n'The beasts go early and throw him with their eyes ... Breathing in the air breaths upwards.'\nAl-Khuzaimi said:\n'And a group who became riders on wood ... Erected, whose anchor has anchored in the earth.'\n'Stripped except what was of waist-wrappers ... No successor is hoped one day for their wearer.'\nThe other said regarding a standing one:\n'Sitting with a strap in his mouth ... Grim-faced, showing molars.'\n'Spreading his reach without embracing ... Tilting his head without drowsiness.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'How many in the land of Sham you left of them ... Remaining, overlooking the land of Najd.'\n'Playing Dastband alone, even if ... He had a distraction from Dastband.'\nAl-Mubarrad recited for him:\n'He stood and did not seek help from his leg ... He became familiar with his dwelling despite his separation.'\n'As if in the figure, from his bonds ... He saw a beloved he intended to embrace.'\n'As if he is laughing from his cheeks.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'God showed you to me as a companion of a trunk ... Hugging you, not the hug of commitment.'\n'Like a sodomite having a long penis ... Thighing the rented one from a standing position.'\nIbrahim ibn al-Mahdi said:\n'As if he were the limb of a ram and the air for it ... Is the oven of a grilling woman and the trunk is a skewer.'\nDi'bil said:\n'My eyes have not seen like the row of the Zutt ... Fifty of them crucified in a line.'\n'As if you dipped them in naphtha.'\nHe singled out one and said:\n'... As if he, in his excessive trunk.'\n'Is a brother of drowsiness serious in stretching ... Sleep has mixed with him and he did not cover.'\nThe best of what was said in that is the saying of some Bedouin:\n'And as if he were a head at the head of a desert ... Whose stick his hands tied to the shoulders.'\nChapter (6) On the Horse\nFrom the excellent similes in describing the horse is the saying of Imru' al-Qays:\n'And I may leave early while the birds are in their nests ... With a short-haired one, shackle of the wild beasts, huge.'\n'Attacking, fleeing, advancing, retreating together ... Like a boulder of rock the torrent brought down from above.'\nSo he described him with speed in running and success in pursuit.\nAbdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz said regarding the speed of the horse:\n'Faster than water to a descent ... And than the return of the glance of the suspicious.'\nAnother said, who is Ali ibn al-Jahm:\n'Upon a horse like the glance in the speed of the glance ... And like the heart, his heart in intelligence.'\n'Eyes do not see him except as a phantom ... And he is like the phantom in folding.'\nIbn al-Qariyyah described a horse Al-Hajjaj gifted to Abd al-Malik, saying:\n'I have sent a horse of good stature, smooth cheek, preceding the glance and exhausting description.'\nA Bedouin was asked: How is the running of your horse? He said: He runs as long as he finds ground.\nPoets have many poems describing the horse, among them Abu Du'ad al-Iyadi, Al-Nabigha, Al-Ja'di, Al-As'ar al-Ju'fi, Muzarrid, Salamah ibn Jandal, Tufayl al-Ghanawi, and others from the ancients and moderns and those in between. But the condition in what I explained in this book is selecting rare similes, not descriptions and metaphors. What came in mention of this chapter is much, and if we intended to categorize chapters, the condition in simile would be void, good selection would cease, and the lean would mix with the fat and the cold with the hot. In Allah we trust and seek help.\nHis saying: 'Shackle of the wild beasts, huge': The 'Awabid' are everything that became wild of wild cows, gazelles, etc., singular 'Abidah'. From it their saying: 'You have brought an Abidah of speech' i.e., its wild/strange one. He informed that he caught them so he became like a shackle for them. In success with hunting, he says in another poem:\n'When we rode, the children of our family said ... Come, until the game comes to us, we gather wood.'\nUmarah ibn Aqil said mentioning a horse:\n'And I see the wild beasts in my right hand whenever ... His rein is in my left hand one day.'\nAbu Nuwas said in similar confidence:\n'I may leave early while the birds are in their dwellings ... With dogs frolicking in their leashes.'\n'Counting the eye of the wild beast among their foods.'\nAl-Shammakh said:\n'Little of old wealth other than a bow and arrows ... As if what is shot of the wild beasts is frozen (Tariz).'",

    "text": "i.e., stiff and cold. The 'Haykal' is the building, and the horse is likened to it if it is huge. Regarding that is the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n'Like the built Haykal except that he ... In beauty came like an image in a Haykal (temple/altar).'\nImru' al-Qays said:\n(Mutaqarib Meter)\n'And I ride in the fright a Khayfanah (locust-like mare) ... Her face covered by spreading palm branches.'\n'Al-Khayfanah' is the locust, and the long-legged, meatless female horse is called 'Khayfanah', and that is praised in her.\n'She has a hoof like the cup of the boy ... A knotted shank was mounted in it.'\nHe meant her hoof is cup-shaped, which is firmer for her. Regarding that is the verse of Ibn al-Khara':\n'She has a hoof like the cup of the boy ... The mouse takes a cave in it.'\n'Al-Wazif': Between the pastern and the knee.\n'She has a rump like the rock of the stream ... A harmful torrent exposed it.'\nIt is said 'Sayl Juhaf' and 'Juraf' if it swept away everything. Thus Al-Juhfah was named because a flood in Jahiliyyah swept it away.\n'She has a tail like the train of the bride ... She blocks her vulva with it from behind.'\nThe train of the bride is dragged because she is most shy on that night.\n'She has a forehead like the back of the shield ... The capable maker smoothed it.'\n'Al-Mijann': The shield. He meant her forehead is wide.\n'If she advances, you say a gourd ... Of the green ones dipped in the pools.'\nHe meant she is smooth like the 'Dubba'' which is the gourd. Slenderness of the front is praised in female horses, therefore they likened them to the thorn/needle for the slenderness of its front.\n'And if she turns sideways, you say a locust (Sur'ufah) ... Having a tail behind it extended.'\n'Al-Sur'ufah': The locust. He likened her for her lightness.\n'And if she retreats, you say a tripod stone ... Rounded, having no trace.'\n'And she runs like the running of the escape of the does ... The capable skillful one missed them.'\nCombining good simile, good metaphor, and brilliance of meaning are the verses of Al-Ta'i describing a horse Al-Hasan bin Wahb gave him. They are beautiful in the connection of their arrangement and description. If we detached the verses of simile from the verses indicating them or pointing to them from it and others arranged in its order, the verse would come mutilated and cut off, and the benefit in it would be little and the enjoyment from it narrow. Our purpose in what we establish is rare similes. So if the verse of simile is connected to what follows it, we mention it if it indicates it, and if it stands alone and nothing else is mixed with it. Likewise, if something comes with no simile resembling the meaning of what has a particle of simile, we mention it with it and add it to it.\nAl-Ta'i said:\n(Munsarih Meter)\n'Excellent enjoyment of the world he gifted you with ... A magnificent one, neither deviating nor cowardly.'\n'Yellow of them (horses) as if he were the yolk of the ... Egg, pure as if he were the handle of a bow.'\n'His neck is a trunk of Arak, and what is ... Behind the rump of him is a rock of Jals.'\n'Saffron almost flows from the water of his ... Sides, and Wars is gathered from his back.'\n'Refined in his genus and possessed the goal ... By himself, so he alone is a genus.'\n'Smeared from his color so he came as if ... The sun was eclipsed in his skin.'\nHis saying: 'So he alone is a genus': He meant his offspring is attributed to him excluding others for his nobility, as it is said 'This horse is from the lineage of Dhu al-Iqal' and 'Ashqar Marwan' and the like. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to his companions: \"Follow me, you will become houses or households.\" He said: And the family of Abu Bakr are called Bakris, not Taymis, and the family of Umar are called Umaris, not Adawis.\nHis saying: 'Pure as if he were the handle of a bow': 'Al-'Ajs' is the handle of the bow. It became pure and beautiful due to the frequent touch of the hand on it.\nAl-Buhturi said regarding a blond horse:\n'A marking that deceives the eyes, you see that ... Upon him from it are filings of gold.'\n'The dye of the horizon between the end of a night ... Passing its affair and the beginning of a dawn.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a bay horse:\n'And an aged horse, four are his lights ... As if his supper is from his skin.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'Did your hands return me with an A'waj (noble horse) ... Like the arrow of the Nab' tree in harmonized feathers?'\n'With a dark one like darkness, blaze-faced clearing ... With his blaze the darknesses of the night.'\n'You see his white anklets ascending in him ... The ascent of lightning in the waterless cloud.'\nHis saying: 'Like the arrow of the Nab' tree': He meant an arrow and likened him to it for his smoothness and slenderness, as Jarir said:\n'And the chase with the leading folded their backs ... The folding of the merchants in Hadramout of the cloaks.'\nAl-As'ar said describing gathered horses:\n'They come out from the gaps of dust frowning ... Like the fingers of the cold person, squatting then warming himself.'\nThe cold person, when warming himself, gathers his fingers and does not spread them.\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And horses the leading folded until they were as if ... Brown tubes from the spears of Al-Khatt, withered.'\n'We poured our whips upon them unjustly ... So hands fast and feet flew with them.'",

    "text": "Similar to it is his saying regarding a horse:\n'The most wasted thing is his whip when he rides him.'\nLikening them to tubes is an old, circulated simile. Similar to it is the saying of Abu Du'ad:\n(Mutaqarib Meter)\n'And I may leave early in the whiteness of morning ... And the ends of a night turning its tail.'\n'With a horse disputing with me a nose-rein ... Leading, pure of lineage.'\n'If shackled, he rushes blindly whoever led him ... And his neck sinews turn and he extends.'\n'Like the shaking of the Rudayni spear between palms ... Running in the tubes then trembling.'\nAl-Ta'i said mentioning a horse:\n'If he visited a field, he captivated its people ... Or a club, the sitting ones stood for him.'\n'You see the composed of the people, their eyes ... Have become ugly from his beauty while they look askance.'\n'As if a lightning flash appeared to them ... In the drought, or a bride was led to them.'\n'High, if you view him from the side, adorned him ... A moist top and a dry bottom.'\n'As if madness mixed with him ... Or wine flirted with his head.'\n'The envier sought refuge for him out of stinginess with him ... And souls fluttered over him in fear.'\nAl-Buhturi said, and he was a describer of horses:\n'As for the excellent horse, we have tested his day ... And a day suffices as news for his year.'\n'He raced the excellent horses and flew from their imaginations ... In precedence, and almost flew from his own imaginations.'\n'Joyful, the sides of a blaze slap him ... Coming the coming of the full moon at its completion.'\n'He blackened, then cleared to the eyes of an onlooker ... His sides, so he shone in his darkness.'\n'The sides of his mane inclined so they were as if ... The branches of a tamarisk inclined under its doves.'\n'And the front of the ears, you think that ... With them he sees the person who is in front of him.'\n'And as if his rider behind his occiput ... Is a pillion rider, for you do not see him from his front.'\n'His sides softened so it was imagined that he ... Is related to the rattan in his bones.'\n'In a flame like gray hair passing by my parting ... Flirting with it from his gray hair with his passion.'\n'And as if his neighing when he rose with it ... Is thunder rattling in the crowding of its clouds.'\n'Like the crow walking competing with his companions ... With the blackness of his dye and the beauty of his stature.'\n'And the horse is the most attracting visitor for provision ... As long as you do not visit him with his saddle and bridle.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'I may leave early while the morning is like gray hair ... With an aged, marked, swift horse.'\n'Having an ear like the palm leaf of the branch ... Or a myrtle leaf overlooking a rod.'\nAl-Umani the Rajiz recited to Al-Rashid in the description of the horse:\n'As if his two ears when they perked up ... A feather or a pen sharpened.'\nThose present knew he made a grammatical error and did not know how to correct it. Al-Rashid said: Say: 'You imagine his two ears when they perked up.'\nAdi bin Zaid said regarding a horse:\n(Mutaqarib Meter)\n'He has a neck like the trunk of the tall palm ... And the ear is listening like the pen.'\nAl-Mubarrad mentioned that Jarir said: I entered upon Al-Walid bin Abd al-Malik bin Marwan while Ibn al-Riqa' was reciting his Daliyyah (poem ending in Dal) to him. When he reached his saying 'He drives a nasal-sounding (female), as if the tip of his horn', I said to myself: By Allah, the Sheikh has fallen, where will he get 'As if'? When he said 'A pen that took from the inkwell its ink', I envied him, so I went out and did not recite anything.\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'And a blaze-faced in the dark time, ankleted ... I went from him on a blaze-faced, ankleted.'\n'Like the built Haykal except that he ... In beauty came like an image in a Haykal.'\n'A tail as the cloak is dragged, defending ... A mane, and a mane like the lowered veil.'\n'Joyful, shaking a forelock in a blaze ... Pure white, whose anklets flow in rocks.'\n'Like the returning intoxicated one, most of his walk ... Width-wise on the far, longest array.'\n'You imagine Gemini in his pasterns ... And the full moon is the blaze of his rejoicing face.'\n'Pure of skin, as if concerned with it ... For the purity of his color, the polishers of a polisher.'\n'And as if shook upon him its dye ... A red wine of Baradan or Qutrabbul.'\n'And you imagine him clothed in cheeks, soft ... Whenever the glance connects with them, they blush.'\n'And you see his flame rising in the dust ... In color and intensity like the ignited fire.'\n'Trilling of neighing, as if in his tones ... Are the tones of Ma'bad in the beginning.'\n'He possessed the eyes, so if he appeared, they gave him ... The look of the lover to the approaching beloved.'\nIbn al-Zayyat said regarding the workhorse (Birdhawn) he took from Al-Wathiq:\n'And as if your saddle when it topped you was a cloud ... And as if under the cloud was a star.'\n'And you became ringing of bridle, as if ... In every limb of you a cymbal is struck.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:",

Marked, swift horse.'\n'Repelling the pebbles with a hoof ... Like the overturned cup.'\n'His blaze became clear ... In the place of frowning.'\nAl-Buhturi said asking Ibn Humayd for a horse:\n'So help in raiding the enemy with one folded ... His insides the folding of the rolled book.'\n'Either with a blond, bright, covering the war ... From him with the like of the blazing star.'\n'Clad in a marking that painted his sides ... With blood, so nothing meets you but blood-stained.'\n'Or a black, pure of skin, as if he is ...

Like the light of the star in brightness.'\n'He has the two neck sides of a gazelle ... Terrified of the hunter.'\n'If his rider overlooks ...

Lean-bellied like the folded scrolls.'\n'They turn to terror ... Eyes like flasks.'\n'And ears, listening ... Like halves of hive covers.'\n'As if they meet the earth ... With the tails of wasps.'\nAnother said regarding a horse:\n'He came like the flash of lightning, his rain boiled ... His first swims and his last overflows.'\n'So his hoof does not touch the ground.'\nKhalaf al-Ahmar said regarding a bull:\n'And as if his buttocks strove ... That his four (legs) do not touch the ground.'\nAnother said regarding dogs:\n'As if they raise what is not put down.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And I leave early at the edge of the night ... With a spirited, bay, flying one.'\n'Galloping wet his sides as ... The cup of wine overflowed in the hand of the boon companion.'\nAnother said regarding a sweating horse:\n'As if he, while his eye is high ... Wrapped, came from the bath.'\nAl-Buhturi gifted a horse to Ubaydullah bin Yahya bin Khaqan and wrote to him:\n'What do you see in a compact, thick-legged one ... From the lineage of A'waj like the looming meteor?'\n'The humbleness of the young does not hold him back ... The weakness of fatigue, and he is not the tiredness of the aged.'\n'He struts in a marking whose light ripples ... The rippling of chainmail on the spearing brave.'\n'If the thirsty were to sip in it, he would not incline ... A glance to the sweet flowing fresh water.'\n'I gifted him so you may go white, clear ... From him upon a joyful, white, clear one.'\n'So it would be the first tradition transmitted ... Or the praised one accepts the gift of the praiser.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And I have trodden the rain, carried by ... A horse like the color of the morning when it arrived.'\n'He walks and turns sideways in the rein as ... The adored one possessing coquetry turned away and repelled.'\n'The gathering of the herd's limbs, so the ... Running is not upon him when he runs with intensity.'\n'He wet the oryx with their blood and ... A body of him did not get wet with sweat.'\n'And as if he is a wave that melts if ... You released him, and if you held back, he froze.'\nHe also has:\n'And I race the rein of the morning, early ... While the night is exposed of sides, departing.'\n'And the star, a Levantine wind polishes it ...

Are the heads of nails on his edge.'\n'As if behind the meeting of his eyelids ... Is the ember of Ghada wood sprinkled from its fire.'\n'So he turned like the star in its descent ... The turn of the pointer at midnight with his fire.'\nDhu al-Rumma said regarding the speed of running:\n'As if he is a star in the trace of a demon ... Marked in the blackness of the night, swooping down.'\nIbn al-Rumi took that and said at the end of a poem mocking a man:\n'Take it, pursuing the one who turned away, marked ... As if it were a star in the trace of a demon (Ifrit).'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a female dog:\n'And a bright female dog like the meteor ... You think her in the speed of gliding.'\n'A luminous star appeared in pouring down ... Light of tread on the dust.'\nKhalaf al-Ahmar said regarding a bull:\n'Like the shining star, exerting ... A run whose fastest escapes the glance.'\n'And as if his buttocks strove ... That his four (legs) do not touch the ground.'\nAbu Nuwas said describing the dog:\n'He sent him like the arrow when he shot high with it ... Outstripping the glance of the eye in his dust-raising.'\n'He almost slips out of his skin ... Like the flash of lightning in his cloud.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a female dog, her time of running was not seen ... Ever when she was released from her strap.'\n'I waded with her a night seen like her skin ... As if it borrowed the color of her coat.'\n'So she saw ten coming after her ... And was released, so she launched from her knot.'\n'Like the arrow, knowing nothing but her seriousness ... The Merciful caused me to lose the day of her loss.'\nAbu Nuwas said regarding the dog:\n'As if his back muscles when he slips away ... Are the back muscles of a snake persisting in its gliding.'\n'As if the claw in his sheath ... Is the razor of a craftsman returned to its handle.'\n'You see him in the run when urged ... Almost exiting from his skin.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a female dog that boasted over the dogs ... With a yellow skin like gold (Ziryab).'\n'Gliding like the gliding snake.'\nThe meaning of Abu Nuwas's saying: 'Almost exiting from his skin': belongs to Dhu al-Rumma describing two bulls that fled:\n'They do not save any remaining (effort) from the deep running ... Until the skins are almost peeled off them.'\nKuthayyir said regarding a horse:\n'If he runs relying on his mother ... He almost splits his skin from his flesh.'\nIbn al-Riqa' said regarding two running bulls:\n'They take turns in a sheet of dust ... White, woven, which they both wove.'\n'Folded if they arrive at a hard place ... And if the hooves find soft ground, she spreads it.'\nAl-Tirimmah said regarding a bull:\n'The lands show and hide him as if he were ... A sword on a height, drawn and sheathed.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding dogs:\n'You imagine them in the circle of collars ... Laughing teeth from the width of the jaws.'\nAbu Nuwas said regarding it:\n'You see if you opposed him fleeing ... Daggers that grew in lines.'\n'He gives you his utmost abundant run ... A running, you see from his spurring the fingernail.'\n'Stripping from his ear thongs.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a female dog with whom youths went early ... Time released them from its hand.'\n'As if she, when she stretched, is a snake (Jan) ... Or a spear and her snout is the spearhead.'\n'And gazelles appeared for her glance ... So she caught up with what the rein caught up with.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'You see him with two jaws, line by line ... And a smooth lip and a lank jaw.'\n'That and two back muscles, if he stretches ... You say two straps that excelled cutting.'\n'You see if the running was envy ... Claws, black tripod stones, smooth.'\n'He pulls his ears with them a pull ... You imagine two arrows from him stripped.'\n'They do not fall on the ground except ahead ... As if they hasten something picked up.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a horse:\n'And four as if she snatches it ...

Of the heat of midday, is oil in flasks.'\nAl-Shamardal al-Yarbu'i said regarding a hawk:\n'As if his eyes when he revealed them ... Are two rubies whose buyer profited.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said describing a falcon:\n'I may leave early at the breath of morning ... With a lord of hunting, possessing liveliness.'\n'Hanging the glances on the figures ... Running in the air with the wing.'\n'Collected feathers, beautiful in whiteness ... Upon him from it is like the bubbles of wine.'\n'Possessing a bell like the loud cockroach.'\nHe also has:\n'And youths went early while the night was dark ...

As if the slough of the snake is from his clothes.'\nAl-Shamardal said regarding the hawk:\n'I may leave early while the night is in its robe ... With a Tuji (hawk) who hunted in his youth.'\n'So he swooped like the boulder when he rose with it ... As if with the hollow of his dye.'\n'Is the safflower of the dyer or his butcher ... Or the extraction of musk with which he is painted.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a strong falcon understanding the speech of the speaker ... Rounded of head, grand of shoulder.'\n'Hooked of claws, seeking, passing through ... As if they are Nuns of the hand of the fast writer.'\n'Possessing a breast wearing a beautiful brocade ...

As if in his jaw are two spearheads.'\n'And in the sockets of his head are two lamps.'\nKhalaf said:\n'And folded on the sand dune like the plate ... As if he is dark from the night, dusk.'\nAnother said:\n'His jaw muscles were created separate and his head ... Like the disk flattened from barley flour.'\n'And as if his two jaws when you viewed him ... Are the jaws of an old woman rinsing for purification.'\n'And he turns an eye for the sting as if it were ... The two eyes of a brave snake from behind dust.'\nAnother said:\n'O Lord, if my brother Zayd ate ... My flesh unjustly, second drinking after first.'\n'Then send him a serpent from the root ...

Like the waving of two hands in a crowned cloud.'\nAnother said:\n'I was sleepless for a lightning at the end of the night flashing ... Moving diligently therein, blowing and sleeping.'\n'Moving like the sipping of birds while the night is striking ... With its curtains and the morning almost shines.'\nAnother said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'I was sleepless for a lightning moving at midnight ... Hidden like your wink with the eyebrow.'\n'As if its shining in the sky ... Is the hands of a writer or the hands of a calculator.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said describing a cloud:\n'I saw in it its lightning since it appeared ... Like the glance of the eye or a heart beating.'\n'Then the east wind drove it until appeared ... In it, besides the lightning, like meteors.'\n'You think it in it when cracked ... Its insides from it, a snake writhing.'\n'And at times you think it as if it is ... A piebald horse whose covering tilted when he leaped.'\n'Until when the day raised the forenoon ... You thought it chains of gold.'\n'Ash-Shuja'' here is the snake, and it is taken from the saying of Di'bil in his saying:\n'I was sleepless for a lightning at the end of the night pouring ...

Like the growling of stallions among the she-camels.'\n'And you see the lightning, a spreading cloud ...

Fulfills the need of my heart and departs.'\nAntara said regarding its lingering and light:\n'Lo, O one for this Yemeni lightning ...

    "text": "'O Sahm, for the lightning that flew ... It returned, despite the darkness, day.'\n'It became water for us and was fire ... It pleased the soil and angered the dust.'\nThe people of meanings recite regarding it:\n'A fire renewing for the sticks their burning ... And the fire scorches sticks so they burn.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'So it watered them, even if its distance prolonged ... The succession of time, its night and its day.'\n'Every generosity, when the lightning met in it ... Its fire was kindled for the eyes with water.'\nAnother said:\n'The lightning appeared from towards Hijaz so it excited me ... And for every Hijazi the lightning is exciting.'\n'It moved like the pulse of the vein while the night was before it ... And the mountains of Najd all of them and the deserts.'\nAl-Ta'i said similar:\n'To you a people traveled with praise as if they are ... On the saddles, snakes of the mountain paths, moving.'\n'Watching lightnings of catching up as if they are ... When their first appeared, pulsing veins.'\n'Al-Lisab': Roads in mountains, singular 'Lisb'. 'An-Nadanid': Snakes, singular 'Nadnad', which has movement that does not settle. 'Al-Mays': Wood of the saddle. He informed that they were tired from travel until they became in slenderness like snakes. Similar is his saying also:\n'And riders like spearheads camped ... On the like of it while the night, its darknesses assault.'\n'For a matter upon them is that its beginnings complete ... And not upon them is that its consequences complete.'\nAnd he has regarding travelers who exhausted their mounts:\n'They have eaten the humps from them by night travel ... And their figures became to them like humps.'\nChapter (10) On the Emaciation of Travelers\nConnected to this regarding the emaciation of travelers, leanness of camels, and intensity of fatigue is the saying of Dhu al-Rumma:\n'And disheveled like the sword, his body has become lean ... And the carcasses of the Mahri camels and the distant worries.'\n'Slumber gave him the cup of drowsiness to drink, so his head ... To the religion of slumber from the beginning of the night is prostrating.'\nAnother said:\n'And a desert as if the night wrapped ... Its riders with the sons of Ham.'\n'I waded in it to the Caliph at Al-Sharafah ... Two seas of noon and darkness.'\nAl-Ta'i said describing travelers:\n'Toil blackened their faces so as if they ... And their father is Shem, their father is Ham.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Then a preceding guide consulted them ... Rising to his goal with the eyes of a falcon.'\n'His face wore pallor with the noons ... So he is like a mirror not polished.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'She visited disheveled ones like swords and she-camels ... Lean from the offspring of Al-Jadil and Da'ir.'\n'They pulled the nose-rings until they leaned and turned ... The noses of the Mahri camels to a strength in the nostrils.'\nIn describing the she-camel he also says:\n'A returner of travels, as if her rein ... Is a snake on the left of the forearms, head down.'\nAnother said:\n'She disputes a doubled Hadrami (rope) as if it is ... A snake of a sand dune followed by a thrower moving away.'\nHe likened her rein to the snake. Al-Farazdaq said:\n'When they were made to kneel, they faced from their backs ... Lean ones like crescents, emaciated.'\nThabit Qutna said regarding a she-camel:\n'And as if the path of the straps on her side ... Are roads cutting deserts and hills.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a she-camel:\n'She gazes with a look as if its orbit ... You said overlooked a high place not descended.'\n'And as if the traces of straps on her side ... Are the night path of snakes in pouring sand.'\n'And as if her place of falling when she camped ... Are traces of the place of falling of a prostrating devotee.'\n'And her tail is blocked by a complete rope ... Like the branch of a palm tree whose leaves were not stripped.'\nHe also said:\n'As if the mounts when they left early in the morning ... Left nests of sandgrouse in the kneeling places.'\nMalik bin akhi Rafi' said:\n'As if their eyes are rock pools ... Water descends from their tear ducts.'\nAl-Attabi said:\n'When the mounts, their eyes are sunken ... Just as flasks contained oil.'\nSimilar is the saying of another regarding a weary she-camel, who is Dhu al-Rumma:\n'As if her eye is of her when she became lean ... And the travel joined it a joining in the Adamim.'\n'Al-Ada': Ponds. 'Al-Mida'ah': What is used for ablution for prayer.\nAnother said:\n'Oh, how lovely is the life of ease and lying ... Beside a shaker of the girth, wide-stepping.'\n'Al-Wadin' for the camel is like the girth for the beast. 'As-Sa'um': Wide-stepping.\n'Terrors threw her until as if ... She was carved from her sides with an adze.'\nIbn al-Khatim said similar to that:\n'And she became lean until as if her girth ... Is the sash of a bride roaming from her on a waist.'\nDhu al-Rumma said regarding the weariness of a she-camel:",

Similar is the saying of Al-Muthaqqib al-Abdi:\n'When I stood to saddle her at night ... She moaned the moan of the sad man.'\nAbu Nuwas said regarding her speed:\n'And she bore with me the terror of every desert ... Crazy, in her is the boldness of a daring one.'\n'She leaves the mounts behind her and as if she is ... A row she precedes and she is an Imam.'\nAll of them describe a she-camel with huge size and height, like the saying of Tarafa:\n'Like the bridge of the Roman whose owner swore ... It would be raised until plastered with bricks.'\nAnd like the saying of Antara:\n'So I stopped my she-camel in it and as if she is ... A palace, to fulfill the need of the lingerer.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'We have camels filling the space as if they ... Carried the black hills above the withers.'\nIbn Abi Hafsa said:\n'Following one ignorant of the rein as if she is ... One of the bridges while she is a lean camel.'\nAl-Ra'i said describing her ribs:\n'And as if there butted on her middle ... Mountain goats on a peak that completed and became old.'\nAl-Farazdaq said regarding her speed:\n'She strives with them through the middles of every desert ... As if the mounts protect themselves with her from embers.'\nAl-Farazdaq said regarding a she-camel:\n'Her hands expel the pebbles in every midday heat ... The expelling of dirhams by the critics of moneychangers.'\nSimilar is the saying of the other (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Their pads fly the pebbles ... Just as the moneychanger picked the dirham.'\nRu'ba said:\n'As if their hands in the smooth plain ... Are hands of maids passing leaves.'\nMuslim bin al-Walid said:\n'To the Imam she guided us with our saddles ... A creation from the wind in the likeness of ostriches.'\n'As if her escape while dawn takes her ... Is the escape of one returning from the bow of a crossbow.'\nThe Arabs liken her speed to the fleeing of ostriches. Layla al-Akhyaliyyah said:\n'They aimed at her with light bodies so you do not see ... For her a likeness except the frightened ostrich.'\nTha'lab said: Bodies here mean bodies. He said: And in the saying of the Mighty and Majestic \"And your clothing purify\", he said: Your heart.\nAnother said:\n'When she kneeled, she fell on her calluses ... Keeping a backbone away like the arch of the bridge.'\n'As if her hands when her plaits run ... Are two chased ones and the legs are two seekers of revenge.'\nAnother said:\n'Red from the offspring of Mahri camels, her offspring ... When her hand and leg throw each other.'\n'As if she is a jealous woman whose mind was provoked ... She came to the one whom her husband feared.'\nAl-Ghatammish al-Dabbi said:\n'As if her hands when her salvation became serious ... Began swimming in a flood, reaching out.'\nSimilar is the saying of Bishamah bin al-Ghadir (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'As if her hands when she trotted ... And had been confused then found the way.'\n'Are hands of a swimmer who choked in a flood ... So death overtook him except a little.'\nIncluded in this chapter, even if it has no simile, is the saying of the poet:\n'I say to a lean camel whose fat the journey removed ... So nothing remained of her except bone covered with skin.'\n'Take me, may Allah afflict you with longing and passion ... And the cooing of the singing pigeon excite you.'\n'So she walked joyfully fearing the call of a lover ... The darkness trots with me in every desert.'\n'When she slowed in walking, I repeated my call ... So it was a whip for her until the morning of tomorrow.'\nAl-Quda'i said:\n'Sunken-eyed, swift ones, when the drivers urged them ... You thought their legs were in front of their hands.'\nMuslim said:\n'To you, O Trustee of Allah, the sandgrouse startled us ... Daughters of the wilderness in every soft ground and desert.'\n'They took to night travel the taking of the violent one and hastened ... Her steps with her while the star is bewildered, guided.'\n'They wore the darkness until the heads of the stars of the night ... Were stripped and descended like the throwing with the hand.'\nChapter (11) On the Mirage\nConnected to this chapter in beautiful simile regarding the mirage is the saying of Muslim in this poem:\n'And a hollow causing the foot of the traveler to slip, fearful ... As if on its sides is the edge of a file.'\n'Girded with the mirage in it as if it is ... Men sitting in washed sheets.'\nAnother said:\n'I scare with Al-Hajjaj until as if ... A broken bone in the heart is moved.'\n'And short of the hand of Al-Hajjaj from reaching me ... Is a carpet for the hands of swift camels, wide.'\n'Deserts resembling each other as if their mirage ... Is sheets in the hands of washers, washed.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And the mirage, the hills danced in it as ... Pregnant women fondled children with bouncing.'\n'As if it is suits spread between the stones ... So they are between clothed and exposed.'",

Wrapping, and as if the night is teak (sijan).'\nThen he likened the night and the mirage to the sea, saying:\n'As if they are ships in the shallows of the forenoon ... And whales in the depths of darkness.'\n'Al-Saj': The black shawl. There is disagreement about likening the night to it; it was said for its blackness, and it was said it was likened to it because it has no sides.\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'The mirage, its waves leap with the stones ... The leaping of the Kudri sandgrouse in the traps.'\n'And the shadow is coupled with every mount ... The walking of dark Mahri camels between mares.'\nSimilar is the saying of the other:\n'And the sun shod her with a shadow as if it is ... A young ostrich her feathers made sway.'\nMas'ud, brother of Dhu al-Rumma, said:\n'And a desert in which the mirage glimmers ... Its guide in a depression is thrown.'\n'The people toil in it until they are exhausted ... Then they remain as if they did not leave.'\n'As if they spent the evening where they spent the morning.'\nAl-Ma'mun said (Munsarih Meter):\n'She opens with the promise the door of her gift ... Until you see the connection then it closes.'\n'A promise like the glimmer of the mirage you think ... Near you while beneath it is twilight.'\nAnother followed him and said:\n'What is my trick for a beloved ... Whose promise is the glimmer of the mirage?'\n'He promises connection but ... Beneath it is the touch of clouds.'\n'I praise Allah for what ... Is with me, even if I am for what is with me.'\nAbu Uthman al-Najim wrote to Ibn al-Rumi blaming him for asking for fish from Ibn Bishr al-Marthadi (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'O Abu Hasan, you are one whose no ... descent we praise in examination its preponderance.'\n'So why did you not think well of Al-Marthadi ... While Allah has decreased his kindness?'\n'And the sea of mirage escapes the seeker ... So say regarding your seeking: its whales.'\nSimiles of moderns like Abu Nuwas, Bashar, Muslim, Al-Ta'i, Al-Buhturi, Ibn al-Rumi, Ibn al-Mu'tazz and their likes have recurred in our book because we relied on establishing the best selected similes and strange distant meanings, not the common worn-out ones. Although the ancients opened the speech and opened the door for the moderns and paved the way for them, so they had the virtue of precedence and initiating meanings and the difficulty of beginning, these (moderns) have improved contemplation, hit the mark in simile, generated meanings, added to what they transmitted, and were strange in what they innovated. If we established their ancient similes like likening the she-camel in bulkiness to the castle and bridge, in hardness to the anvil and rock, in speed to the boulder and tripod stone, and the speed of the horse to the escape of the gazelle, and likening the generous to the sea, the master to the horn (stallion of camels), the beautiful face to the moon and sun, women's litters to palm trees and ships, stars to lamps, and women to ostrich eggs, the book would have been long with that, and most of it would return to one meaning, and the narrated part of it would be known not strange, so the beauty of selection, refining words, and strangeness of meanings would disappear. Our quest is for the good wherever found, and we intended the fresh and rare for whomever it was. And through Allah is power and strength.\nChapter (12) On the Night Visit of Horses (Phantom)\nFrom the beautiful simile in the night visit of horses is the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n'Are you serious? A phantom never ceases to travel to Zaynab ... If the darkness returns, he returns.'\n'He traveled from the heights of Sham, brought by slumber ... The blowing of the garden breeze brought by the east wind.'\nHe also said:\n'She visited us after the calm, so she permitted ... A connection which, when you seek it in seriousness, she prevents.'\n'And she turned away as if separation pulls her figure ... At the time she turned away from my vitals and ribs.'\nThe origin of this meaning is for Qays bin al-Khatim, and from him Al-Buhturi and others took it, which is his saying:\n'Indeed I traveled and I was not a traveler ... And dreams bring near the non-near.'\n'And what she prevents awake, she may give ... In sleep, not restricted nor calculated.'\nBased on that is the saying of Al-Mu'ammil:\n'Slumber came to me at night with a person I love ... The horizons shone for him while the night was dark.'\n'And he spoke to me in sleep not angry ... And my covenant with him awake is he does not speak.'\nAl-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf mentioned the cause in the night visit of the phantom, saying:\n'Your phantom when I sleep is before my eyes ... Until the time of my waking, it does not leave.'\n'And it does not visit me as a connection, but ... The soul's talk about you is the means to it.'\nAl-Ta'i followed him and said:\n'Her phantom visited, nay, rather visited you ... A thought, if the thought of creation slept, did not sleep.'\n'A gazelle I hunted when I set up for him ... At the end of the night traps of meat.'\nHe also said:\n'The visitor visited you a night from Ram...lah between Al-Hima and Al-Matali.'",

    "text": "'Sleep, for the phantom did not visit you, but ... You, with thought, visited the specter of the phantom.'\nAbd al-Samad bin al-Mu'adhdhal said:\n'I did not attain him, so I attained him by wishes ... In my sleep, secretly from abandonment.'\n'The dream connected between us after abandonment ... And we met while we were separated.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'I see myself never ceasing every night ... Al-Malikiyyah returns to my bed in it.'\n'I rejoice at the nearness of a visiting conversationalist ... And I grieve at the separation of a departing beloved.'\n'So how much for us after distance of separation ... Dreams of slumber drive and gather.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'My thought asked him to visit in sleep ... So he came to it in secrecy and concealment.'\n'Nights are more generous to my heart when ... Distance wounded it than days.'\n'O what a night in which souls visited each other ... Secretly from bodies.'\n'A gathering in which we had no fault ... Except that we were in the invitation of dreams.'\nFrom the beautiful simile in this meaning is the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n'A beloved came in secrecy and in fear ... Traversing the darkness until we met by decree.'\n'I doubted him out of joy and thought him ... An imagination coming in sleep from his specter traveling.'\nHe also said:\n'A thought of her occurred in sleep ... The thought of lightning started then vanished.'\n'What a visitor for you if he traveled intentionally ... And a guest with you if he did it truly.'\n'He appears while slumber is in my eye ... So when sleep leaves it, he becomes invalid.'\nAli bin Yahya said similar to that (Madid Meter):\n'By my father, by Allah, is the one who knocked ... Like the smiling of lightning when it flashed.'\n'The specter of the beloved visited me, so it ... Did not increase except inciting sleeplessness in me.'\nSimilar is the saying of Ahmad bin Yusuf:\n'In the path of Allah is a beautiful love ... That lasted from my heart for a beautiful face.'\n'And a passion I wasted on a resident ... My share from him is nothing but sadness.'\n'He sleeps at night and finds it sweet ... While if I found the goodness of slumber sweet.'\n'A phantom from him visited me having no ... Need except to wake me up.'\nAl-Buhturi said, and he is one of the excellent ones in mentioning the night visit of the phantom:\n'And I see your phantom does not cease with slumber ... Appearing, I meet him or he meets me.'\n'He brings close to me of connection the like of what ... He shows me always of abandonment.'\nHe also has:\n'And a night we nodded off on the white camels, she sent ... A specter of imagination whose false resembles the truth.'\n'Were it not for the whiteness of morning, my clinging would have been long ... To the sides of a gazelle I spent the night flirting with.'\nAl-Tammar said:\n'If your specter visited me, O my master ... I would say: No, by Allah, we will not separate.'\nHe inverted this meaning and said:\n'Your specter comforted me until when ... He intended to leave, I clung to him.'\nAl-Buhturi said (Munsarih Meter):\n'And a visitor who visited one whom he effaced ... Mixing weight with his intimacy his fear.'\n'As if he came fulfilling a promise ... And I spent the night among the watchers looking at him.'\n'I did not forget him being quick in haste ... Merging in speech, shortening it.'\n'As if the haters had attended ... His place or his news came to them.'\nChapter (13) On Weeping\nFrom the good simile in weeping is the saying of the poet:\n'I looked as if I was from behind a glass ... To the house, from the water of longing I look.'\n'So my eyes at times drown from weeping ... So I become blind, and at times they recede so I see.'\n'Neither does my eye clear from the overwhelming water ... Nor does my tear drop from the intensity of passion.'\n'And it is not water that flows from the eye ... But rather my soul melts and drips.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'We stood and eyes were heavy ... A weary look fights their tears.'\n'The watching of slanderers forbade it until ... It hung, neither sinking nor flowing.'\nAnother said:\n'Tears overcame my eye, so my pupil ... Is a drowned one appearing repeatedly and hiding.'\n'So as if I see you from behind a curtain ... The wind shook its surface so it folded.'\nAnother said:\n'Perhaps eyelids that time separated between them ... Will reunite or be sweetened with the taste of sleep.'\n'And a tear is revealed, never ceasing as if it is ... On the cheek, a pouring water pushing a valley.'\n'As if the night clouds and morning clouds took upon themselves ... For him with night tears and morning tears.'\nIbn Harmah said:\n'As if my eyes when their loads turned away ... From me were wings of a pigeon that encountered rain.'\n'Or loose pearls in the necklace of a maid ... Clumsy, the children struggled with her so they scattered.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'What is the matter with your eye, water pours from it ... As if it is from worn-out water skins, a leak?'\nSimilar is his saying:",

    "text": "'And the two waterskins of Kharqa, weak of kidneys ... A water-carrier poured into them and they did not get wet.'\n'Are more wasting of water than your eyes whenever ... You discerned a lightning or imagined a dwelling.'\nImru' al-Qays said:\n'Your eyes, their tears are pouring ... As if their ducts are dripping water.'\n'Or a stream ... In the shadows of palm trees ... The water has a course beneath it.'\nJarran al-Awd said:\n'It became as if the eye is branches of a lote tree ... Upon which is frost from the night's dew dripping.'\nAnother said:\n'An evening of farewell, how ugly of an evening ... But she was not ugly as a bidder of farewell.'\n'As if the descent of tears from her, counting it ... To us is a female counter, counting little and hurrying.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'Stop the white camels at the ruins of Mayya and ask ... Traces like the rags of the patterned cloak.'\n'I think what her asking grants you is ... Tears like the scattering of the detailed pearls.'\nSuch simile is very common and worn out, and the condition in selection is more controlling.\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'I scattered unique tears not strung ... And the tear carries some of the weight of the debt.'\n'She connected a conversation with tears, so her cheek ... Is in the likeness of the border of the marked cloak.'\nSimilar is the saying of the other:\n'So oh for the sorrows if the forenoon shines ... And in my liver from their heat is a fire.'\n'We mixed blood with tears until as if ... Pearls and carnelian are melted in my eye.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'She went seeking refuge for the tear fearing separation of tomorrow ... And every sleeping place returned as thorns to her.'\n'So pity shed for her a rose-colored tear ... From the eyelid running over a rose-colored cheek.'\nIbn Yusuf excelled in his saying:\n'Separation was sweet to us shortly before our farewell ... Then we gulped it like a soaking poison.'\n'And as if the trace of tears on her cheek ... Is dew of frost on a ripe rose.'\nAnother said regarding the same:\n'As if the falling of tears on the heat of her face ... Is the falling of dew overlooking the leaf of the rose.'\nIbn al-Rumi added to this and said (Munsarih Meter):\n'The day of separation of the beloved is not with distance ... Nor is my heart capable of endurance over it.'\n'If you were a witness to us on the day of farewell ... While they were extinguishing the thirst of passion.'\n'You would not see but tears of a weeping woman ... Shedding from an eye onto a cheek.'\n'As if those tears are drops of dew ... Dripping from a narcissus onto a rose.'\nAl-Nashi said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'She wept for separation and I was terrified by ... The weeping of the beloved for the distance of the abodes.'\n'As if the tears on her cheek ... Are the remains of dew on pomegranate blossoms.'\nAl-Buhturi said in the reverse of that:\n'Anemones carrying dew so it is as if ... It is tears of youthfulness on the cheeks of virgins.'\nAbu Nuwas said, which enters this chapter even if it has no simile:\n'One of their women says on the morning of separation ... My liver is hot, so go and patience is yours.'\n'And a tear overcame her, so her tears ... On her cheek are red and on her chest are yellow.'\nHe says the color of her cheek is red so the tear took its form when it fell on it and became red, and the color of her chest is ivory yellow so the color of the tear reaching it became yellow.\nIt was said to Al-Abbas bin Muhammad: What is the color of water? He said: The color of its vessel.\nThe Arabs describe the pearly color, like the saying of Dhu al-Rumma:\n'Black-eyed in whiteness, yellow in brightness ... As if she is silver touched by gold.'\n'Al-Burj': Wideness of the eye. 'Al-Na'j': Intensity of whiteness.\nAl-Muraqqish said:\n'The scent is musk and the faces are Dinars ... And the fingertips are Anam (red tree).'\nIt was said to a Bedouin woman: How is the color of your daughter? She said: Better than the kindled fire.\nBashar said:\n'And you imagine what her clothes gathered upon gold and gold dust.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'A gazelle, as if Allah clothed him ... With shells of pearls as skin.'\n'And you see on his cheeks ... At whatever time you wish, a rose.'\nThis is very abundant. From good metaphor in tears is the saying of Al-Ta'i:\n'Rain of tears watered the land of his cheek ... Until the morning, and his eyes were its sky.'\n'His loved ones did to the core of his heart ... What his enemies do not do to him.'\nSimilar is the saying of Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir:\n'And when I saw separation had become serious ... And stagnation was due from obtaining separation.'\n'We sat and rained tears, their sky ... Eyelids of eyes and the lands were cheeks.'\nThe narrators consider good the saying of Ibn al-Ahnaf (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'She wept, not accustomed to weeping ... You see the tear in her eyes as a stranger.'\nBashar said: The boy of Banu Hanifa, meaning Abbas bin al-Ahnaf, kept entering himself among us and we expelled him until he said:\n'Weeping exhausted the tears of your eye, so borrow ... An eye belonging to another whose tear is flowing.'",

    "text": "'Who will lend you his eye to weep with? ... Have you seen an eye lent for weeping?'\nDi'bil bin Ali said:\n'O quarter, where did Salma head? ... Did she pass? For the soul of his self is more passing.'\n'I do not seek the watering of clouds for it ... In my eye is a substitute for watering.'\nAl-Abbas said, and likened with the best simile, also narrated for Abu Nuwas:\n'May Allah not reward the tear of my eye with good ... And may Allah reward my tongue with all good.'\n'My tear tattled, so it conceals nothing ... And I found the tongue possessing concealment.'\n'I was like the book whose folding hid it ... So they inferred it by the title.'\nChapter 14 On the Sickness of the Eye and Its Coquetry\nFrom the beautiful simile regarding the sickness of the eye and its coquetry is the saying of Abu Nuwas:\n'Weak of returning the glance, you think she is ... Recently recovered from illness.'\nHe said:\n'O gazelle who made the body ... Like his eyes, sick.'\n'There settled in my body what was ... In your eyes, residing.'\nIt was said the most flirtatious verse the Arabs said is the saying of Jarir:\n'Indeed the eyes which in their glance is sickness ... Killed us then did not revive our dead.'\n'They throw down the person of intellect until there is no movement in him ... And they are the weakest of Allah's creation in pillars (limbs).'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Weak are his eyelids ... And the heart of him is stone.'\n'As if his glances ... Are apologizing for his heart.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'And as if in my body is that which ... Is in your eyes of sickness.'\nHe also said:\n'I find the fire borrowed from the fire ... And from the sickness of an eye, my sickness originates.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And she wounds my vitals with a sick eye ... Just as the flat of the sword is soft while the edge is cutting.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'White women turning their eyes to youth ... As if they are turning cups with them.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'And the cup did not intoxicate me until its circulator ... Aided it against me with his eyes in the morning.'\nMani said:\n'And as if the powers of his eyelids were worn out ... By wine or mixed with drowsiness.'\nAl-Buhturi said (Hazaj Meter):\n'And in the coffee are shapes ... From the cupbearer and colors.'\n'Bubbles like what he laughs ... About while he is joyful.'\n'And intoxication like what an eyelid ... Of his, drowsy, intoxicated.'\n'And the taste of saliva when he was generous ... With it while the lover is madly in love.'\n'We have from his hand wine ... And from his scent basil.'\nAnother said similar to this:\n'She is wine in beauty, and her saliva is like wine ... And the delicacy of that color is in the delicacy of wine.'\n'For three wines have gathered in it ... And in one is intoxication exceeding intoxication.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'The morning she turned for farewell and greeted ... With the two eyes of a joined one whose eyelids are magic.'\n'I imagined her eyelids twisted by slumber ... Slumber of sleep, or wine swayed her sides.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'And two eyes, Allah said \"Be\" so they were ... Doers to minds what wine does.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'You think him intoxicated if he gazes ... Due to the languor of his eyelids while he is sober.'\nThey likened the eye to the narcissus. Ibn al-Rumi said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And the best of what is in faces are eyes ... And the most similar thing to them is the narcissus.'\nHe also said (Munsarih Meter):\n'As if those tears are drops of dew ... Falling from a narcissus onto a rose.'\nOne of the wits said:\n'A fawn, his cheek and eyes ... Are my rose and my narcissus.'\n'If he is generous to me with wine of his mouth ... Then a session is complete.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Drowsy, slumber deceived his eyelids ... So he imitated with his eye the wilting of the narcissus.'\nThey liken the eye in its coloring to the gazelle's eye. This is an old simile, like the saying of Dhu al-Rumma:\n'The gazelle reminds me of Mayya by its eye ... Repeatedly, and her mouth the blossoming chamomile.'\nIbn al-Riqa' al-Amili said:\n'And as if she, amidst the women, lent her ... His eyes, a gazelle of Jasim with intense white and black eyes.'\n'Drowsy, slumber aimed at him so hovered ... In his eye a sleepiness while he is not sleeping.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'If a white-black gazelle turned away ... To us, I said this is Mayya's eye and her neck.'\nThey only liken the neck to the gazelle's neck in its length and beautiful erection, as Abu Tammam al-Ta'i said (Munsarih Meter):\n'Like the bough in stature, and the gazelle (sun) in joy ... And the fawn of the gazelle in his neck.'\n'And he did not imitate him, and he has no softness ... In his neck, rather he imitated him in his neck.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'One-eyed of the pupil without intense blackness ... Were it not for being one-eyed, he would be ugly.'\n'You think the dot in his eye ... Is a white pearl in a setting of jet.'",

    "text": "Ibn al-Mu'adhdhal said (Madid Meter):\n'I desire in the eye the kiss ... Not much that resembles squint.'\n'And the redness of the cheek from shame ... Indeed I find shame beautiful.'\nChapter 15 On the Face and Its Light\nFrom the old similes regarding the face and its light is the saying of Tarafa:\n'And a face, as if the sun removed its cloak ... Upon it, pure of color, not wrinkled.'\n'Hallat': Spread. 'Ahallahu': From 'Al-Hall' opposite of knotting. Ibn al-Rumi said:\n'As if she sang to the sun of the forenoon ... So it clothed her its beauty as a robe.'\nZuhair said regarding Harim:\n'If you were of anything other than humans ... You would be the illuminator on the night of the full moon.'\nQays bin al-Khatim said:\n'The wish was to meet her, so I met her ... So I played the play of a lied-to man.'\n'So I saw like the sun at its rising ... In beauty, or like its nearing setting.'\ni.e., in two times when looking at the sun is possible. Al-Nimr bin Tawlab said:\n'So she turned away as if the sun under her mask ... An eyebrow of it appeared and she was stingy with an eyebrow.'\nHe meant she turned her face away in anger. Abu Nuwas said similar:\n'O moon at the half of its month ... Showed a light for eight remaining.'\nBashar said regarding a woman who turned away:\n'She was stingy with a cheek and revealed a cheek ... Then turned away like the apostate soul.'\nAmong the best said in praising turning away is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\n'His turning away did not harm me ... From me, but pleased me.'\n'His sideburns are a substitute ... For every beautiful thing.'\n'I did not say that he was undutiful to me ... By turning away, but he was dutiful to me.'\n'He exchanged me for beauty ... A beauty, so what harmed me?'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'The sun and the illuminating moon boast ... If we say they are like the Emir.'\n'So if they resembled him a little ... A great resemblance missed them.'\n'Because the sun sets when it becomes evening ... And that the full moon is decreased by the journey.'\n'And the light of Muhammad is always complete ... On the clarity of the path, it does not recede.'\nAli bin al-Jahm said:\n'O full moon, what have you done to the full moon ... Did you expose him from where time does not know?'\n'You are capturing his moon ... And for that is his night of the month.'\nAnother said:\n'If I blame her, I liken her to the full moon rising ... And suffice you as a fault for her the resemblance of the full moon.'\nAli bin al-Jahm said mentioning women:\n'And they said to us: We are crescents, we only ... Light for the one who travels by night and we do not host.'\n'There is no giving except what a looker takes as provision ... Nor connection except with the phantom that travels by night.'\nAbu Uthman al-Najim said similar to that:\n'I demanded of the one who chased my sleep and terrified ... And kohled the eye with the applicator of sleeplessness.'\n'For a kiss that improves the trace in the heart ... So he said to me rushing: And what are you waiting for?'\n'The eye has no share in the moon except the eye.'\nIbn al-Musayyib al-Katib said:\n'And one with cheeks starting to grow hair I saw him ... Shaking like the moist branch.'\n'He resembled with the growth of hair what ... Is in the full moon of those scars.'\n'By Allah, what the eyes of ... His onlookers gifted to hearts.'\n'From a possessed of coquetry, soft ... Whatever you wish of beauty and goodness.'\n'The eyes of men plundered him ... So there was not a scant share.'\n'But I was pushed to enjoyment ... When he hastened to set.'\n'And he is like the moon of darkness ... When it inclined to setting.'\n'I likened him to the full moon in the two ... States, the simile of the correct one.'\n'Wonder at that if the winking ... Obeyed with the suspicious glance.'\n'So I won the illuminating moon ... On a branch in a sand dune.'\n'And I ascended a pulpit with shaking ... Like the quivering of the preacher.'\n'And I added that to a snorting ... Like the tearing of pockets.'\n'That was possible ... But I was pushed to distresses.'\nIncluded in this category of women's descriptions is the saying of Imru' al-Qays:\n'Her face lights up the bed for her bedfellow ... Like the lamp of oil in the wicks of lamps.'\n'As if on her upper chest is the ember of a warmer ... Who found Ghadha wood thick and covered it with stumps.'\nThe light of oil is brighter than others and less smoky. Regarding that is the saying of Al-Nabigha al-Ja'di regarding a woman (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'The fire illuminated for us a face bright ... Mixing with the heart a mixing.'\n'It lights up like the lamp of oil (Salit) ... Allah made no copper (smoke) in it.'\nThe slave of Banu al-Has-has said:\n'As if the Pleiades were hung above her chest ... And ember of Ghadha whose wind blew glowing.'\n'If she pushed forth in a single sheet and a black garment ... And wrapped the top of the head with a Yemeni cloak.'\n'She showed you on the morning of separation a palm and a wrist ... And a face like the Dinar of Al-Agharra, pure.'\nQays bin al-Khatim said:\n'And a neck like the neck of the gazelle, pure, adorned by ... The glowing of ruby and the separation of chrysolite.'\n'As if the Pleiades above the pit of her throat ... Glow in the darkness what a glowing.'\nSimilar to that is much in their speech, and this sample suffices.\nAbd al-Samad bin al-Mu'adhdhal said regarding women:\n'And they tore the fold of night from ... White necks and cheeks.'\n'So as if the curtains of night laughed ... From the eggs of ostriches.'\nImru' al-Qays said:\n'When she bathed, the excess of her water was ... On her back muscles like pearls with the gatherer.'\nAnother said similar (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'As if the water on her back ... When she scooped it with her cups.'\n'Is pearls rolling on silver ... Which the irons of her treaders polished.'\nAnother said:\n'The bath stripped him of silver ... Revealed from him soft folds.'\n'As if the water on his body ... Is ants on a fresh lily.'\nAl-Nabigha said:\n'The headcover fell and she did not intend to drop it ... So she picked it up and shielded us with the hand.'\n'With a dyed, soft one, as if its fingertips ... Are 'Anam' (red plant) on its branches not knotted.'\n'She looked at you with a need she did not fulfill ... The look of the sick to the faces of the visitors.'\n'Al-Humam claimed that her mouth is cold ... Sweet, if you kissed it you said: Increase.'\n'And if you stabbed, you stabbed in a raised target ... Swollen of touch, plastered with ambergris.'\n'And if you pulled, you pulled from a tight one ... The pulling of the strong man with the firm rope.'\nIn this meaning is what was mentioned in the poem which was not woven on its pattern, famous as being an orphan (unique), and it was said it is by Zawba'ah al-Malha, the beginning of which is:\n'Is there for a questioner a reply regarding the length ... Or does she have a covenant with speaking?'\nUntil he said:\n'And she has a raised organ, its touch ... Narrow are its paths, in it is heat.'\n'And if you stabbed, you stabbed in felt ... And if you pulled, it almost clogs.'\nIbn al-Rumi took this meaning and said describing Al-Hashimi's slave girl with good saliva and tight private part (Munsarih Meter):\n'I described her mouth which I loved despite ... Not testing nor tasting.'\n'Except by your news which fell ... From you to us about the gazelle of Al-Barq.'\n'That blackness smiles revealing whiteness ... Of her mouth like restless pearls.'\n'As if she, while joking makes her laugh ... Is a night whose darkness was torn by dawn.'\n'She has a private part borrowing its heat ... From the heart of a lover and the chest of an angry one.'\n'As if its heat to its tester ... Is what ignited in his insides of burning.'\n'It increases in tightness upon practice as ... The knot of the lasso increases in tightness.'\nHe also said:\n'O likeness of the full moon in beauty ... And in distance of example, become generous.'\n'For the rock might burst ... With fresh water.'\nIn this meaning due to what Al-Rumi has from the beginning of a poem:\n'He hunted hearts with an eye and light ... And captivated minds with panic and light.'\n'And he came with his blue garment sash-wrapped ... As if he is a full moon appeared in a sky.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a boy wearing Jarmi brocade and violet:\n'The garment is the killing of his lover from his disease ... Now you became the full moon since ... You wore the color of his sky.'\nAbu Uthman al-Najim said in this meaning:\n'Qatul did not transgress if she got used to an ... Attire similar to her face possessing splendor.'\n'She wore blue so she came with a face ... Resembling the full moon in the skin of the sky.'\nJarir said:\n'People did not seek description of a thing that pleases them ... But they saw Umm Nuh above what they described.'\nAnd he said:\n'As if she is a bright white cloud appearing ... Or a pearl whose color the shell does not hide.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding women:\n'The full moon humbled itself when they wore luxury ... So they were pearls and the pearl was shells.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding women:\n'If they took off the sheer sheets at times ... They peeled shells off the pearls of Bahrain.'\nChapter 16 On the Walk of Women\nFrom the beautiful simile in the walk of women is the saying of the poet:\n'I likened her walk to the walk of a victor ... Strutting between spearheads and swords.'\n'Arrogant, his soul reached its limit in itself ... When he turned back with his bloody spearhead.'\nAl-Asha said:\n'As if her walk from her neighbor's house ... Is the passing of the cloud, neither slow nor hasty.'\n'Bright, wide-mouthed, polished of side-teeth ... Walking slowly as the barefoot fearful one walks.'\nIbn Muqbil said:",

    "text": "It showed you on the morning of parting a hand and a wrist... and a face like a dinar of the elite, pure. And Qays bin al-Khatim said: And a neck like the neck of a gazelle, pure, adorned by... the glowing of ruby and intervals of chrysolite. As if the Pleiades were above the pit of her throat... glowing in the darkness, oh what a glow! And there is much like that in their speech, and this sample of it suffices. Abdul-Samad bin al-Mu'adhdhal said regarding women: They tore the fold of the night away from... white necks and cheeks; As if the curtains of night laughed revealing... the white eggs [of ostriches]. Imru' al-Qays said: When she bathed, the excess warm water... on her back was like pearls on the harvester. Another said in the Mutaqarib meter: As if the warm water upon her back... when she scoops it with her vessel, is pearls; Rolling upon silver... polished by the irons of its trampler. Another said: The bath stripped her of silver... revealing plump creases of skin; As if the water upon her body... were ants upon a fresh lily. Al-Nabigha said: The veil fell, and she did not intend to drop it... so she picked it up and shielded herself from us with her hand; With a tender, dyed [hand], as if its fingertips were... 'anam' [red fruit] on its branches, not yet knotted. She looked at you with a need she did not fulfill... the look of the sick toward the faces of visitors. The King claimed that her mouth is cold... sweet, if you kissed it, you would say 'give me more'. And if you thrust, you thrust into a target... with a raised touch, plastered with perfume. And if you pull out, you pull out from something tight... the pulling of the strong boatman on a firm rope. In this meaning is what was mentioned in the famous poem—which has no equal woven on its loom—called the 'Orphan', said to be by Zawba'ah al-Mulha, which begins: 'Is there a reply for the asker at the ruins... or is there any covenant for her to speak?' Until he said: 'And she has a raised mound, its touch is... tight in its passages, containing heat; And if you thrust, you thrust into felt... and if you pull out, it almost closes up.' Ibn al-Rumi took this meaning and said, describing the slave girl of Al-Hashimi, regarding the sweetness of saliva and the tightness of the private part (Al-Munsarih meter): I described the mouth that I desired despite... opposition, though it was not tested or tasted; Except by your news that fell... from you to us regarding the gazelle of lightning. That blackness smiles revealing whiteness... from her teeth like shimmering pearls. As if she, when joking makes her laugh... is a night whose darkness is torn by dawn. She has a 'heat' [private part] that borrows its intensity... from the heart of a lover and the chest of one filled with rage; As if its heat, to the one who experiences it... is what burning passion has kindled in his entrails. It increases in tightness during the struggle just as... the knot of a lasso increases in tightness. He also said: O you who resembles the full moon in beauty... and in the distance of the likeness, be generous; For indeed, the rock may burst forth... with fresh water. And in this meaning, due to what Ibn al-Rumi has in the beginning of a poem: 'He hunted hearts with an eye and a light... and captivated minds with fear and brilliance; And he came wearing a blue garment... as if he were a full moon appearing in the sky.' Ibn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a boy wearing Crimons silk and a violet garment: The killing of his lover is part of his illness; Now you have become the full moon since... you dressed in the color of its sky. Abu Uthman al-Najim said in this meaning: The killing glances did not transgress when they found a costume... resembling her face possessing splendor; She wore blue, so she came with a face... resembling the full moon in the skin of the sky. Jarir said: The people never sought the description of something that pleased them... except that they saw the mother of Nuh as greater than what they described. He said: As if she is a bright, shining rain cloud... or a pearl whose color the shell does not hide. Ibn al-Rumi said regarding women: The full moon humbled itself when they donned fine garments... for they were pearls, and the pearls were shells. Al-Buhturi said regarding women: When they took off the sheer robes at times... they peeled off the shells from the pearls of Bahrain [their bodies]. Chapter 16: On the Walking of Women. Among the beautiful similes regarding the walking of women is the saying of the poet: I compared her walk to the walk of a victor... strutting between spearheads and swords; Arrogant, his soul consumed with itself... when he turned with his blood-stained spear. Al-A'sha said: As if her walk from the house of her neighbor... is the passing of a cloud, neither slow nor hasty; A distinct, white woman, her side-teeth polished... she walks slowly/gently just as the barefoot, fearful one walks. Ibn Muqbil said...",

    "text": "'They shake soft limbs for walking ... As the South wind shakes the branches of castor-oil plants (Yabrina) together.'\n'Or like the shaking of a Rudayni spear handled ... By the hands of merchants so they increased its blade in softness.'\n'They walk the pouring of the sand dune whose sides inclined ... It pours at times and the moist earth forbids it at times.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'I decreed that from my saying to a moon ... Playing with kohl at times and dye.'\n'She came pushing in a brocade she has, beautiful ... The pushing of water in a brocade of bubbles.'\nSimilar is the saying of Imru' al-Qays:\n'I rose to her after her family slept ... The rising of water bubbles, state upon state.'\nAl-Tirimmah said praising:\n'He rose to the heights from both its sides ... The rising of water bubbles whose crests boiled.'\nIbn Abi Rabi'ah said:\n'And the voice was lowered from me, I approached the walk ... Of the bubbles, and my corner fearing the people was slanted.'\nAnother said:\n'What is the matter with you, you do not mention or visit ... A white woman between whose eyebrows is light.'\n'She walks as the stream flows.'\nAshja' said:\n'And she waved like the wave of water between her clothes ... A half inclines with it and a half straightens it.'\n'If her thin clothes described what is above the path of her sash ... The waist-wrappers rejected her testimony.'\nAnother said (Munsarih Meter):\n'She walks slowly when she walks, excellently ... The walk of the drained drunkard on an ascent.'\n'She remains from visiting her neighbor's house ... Placing her palm on the liver.'\nAl-Munakhkhal al-Yashkuri said:\n'And I entered upon the young woman ... The curtain on the rainy day.'\n'I pushed her so she pushed ... The walk of the sandgrouse to the stream.'\n'And I kissed her so she breathed ... Like the breathing of the inexperienced gazelle.'\nAl-Harith bin Hillizah said:\n'She went out daring among three like statues ... The walk of ewes in blooming chamomile.'\n'Like the palm branch shaken by strong winds ... And its clusters shook after its fruit.'\nUmar bin Abi Rabi'ah said (Munsarih Meter):\n'I saw her one night and her women ... Walking between the Maqam and the Stone.'\n'Strutting in sheets and cloaks as ... The young cows walk slowly.'\nIbn al-Ahnaf said:\n'A sun determined in the creation of a maid ... As if her flank is the folding of scrolls.'\n'As if she, when she walks among her maids ... Steps on eggs or green flasks.'\nChapter 17 On Hair\nFrom the beautiful simile in hair is the saying of Bakr bin al-Nattah:\n'White, dragging her hair from a standing position ... And disappearing in it while it is thick black.'\n'So as if she is a bright day in it ... And as if it is a dark night upon her.'\nHe said (Munsarih Meter):\n'And coal-black flowing, accepting its path ... When he strutted letting down his braids.'\n'He approached like the night from his partings ... Descending, his descent is not blamed.'\n'Until he reached his places ... Kissing from every footstep its dust.'\n'As if he is a lover approached out of passion ... Until he fulfilled his desire from his beloved.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'And she lowers on the two loins abundant hair as if it were ... Bunches dropped by Shanu'ah or Qasr.'\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'If she put down the Jilbabs and wore ... Of the hair, Mayya, she can hardly shape it.'\nMuslim bin al-Walid said:\n'Are you serious? You do not know that many a night ... As if its darkness spreads from your locks.'\n'I set up for it until it cleared with a blaze ... Like the blaze of Yahya when Ja'far is mentioned.'\nAnother said, who is Ibn al-Mu'tazz (Mujtath Meter):\n'A full moon, a night, and a branch ... A face, hair, and a figure.'\n'Wine, pearls, and a rose ... Saliva, a mouth, and a cheek.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'She gave me drink in a night resembling her hair ... Resembling her cheeks without a watcher.'\n'So I became in two nights of hair and darkness ... And two suns of wine and a beloved's face.'\nChapter 18 On Saliva and the Mouth\nFrom the beautiful simile in saliva and the mouth is the saying of Imru' al-Qays (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'As if wine and the pouring of clouds ... And the scent of lavender and the spread of rain.'\n'Are given as a second drink by the coldness of her canine teeth ... When the early bird sings.'\nHe only meant the time of early morning because mouths change at night due to their closing and shutting. Regarding that is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\n'And no human bane afflicts her ... From sleep except that she becomes cold.'\n'Likewise the breaths of gardens in the morning ... Are pleasant, and the breaths of people change.'\nSimilar is the saying of Ubayd, and narrated for Aws bin Hajar:\n'As if her saliva after slumber was given as a morning drink ... From water of a dark wine in the shop, oozing.'",

    "text": "'Or from a diluted one like musk, its scent ... Or from tubes of pomegranate and apple.'\nSimilar is the saying of Zuhair:\n'As if her saliva after slumber was given as a morning drink ... From the goodness of wine not yet aged.'\nSuch is very abundant.\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'Lo, perhaps I equaled the jealous one and he harmed me ... And we both spent the night with grudge against his brother.'\n'And I kissed sweet mouths as if they were ... Springs of wine whose pebbles are pearls of the sea.'\nHe also said:\n'She chews a saliva whose cold drives away sleep ... And heals the hovering thirsty hearts.'\n'And is there a pool whose pebbles are like her mouth ... Found except good of taste, pure?'\nHe also said:\n'O many a saliva the full moon of darkness spent the night ... Ejecting between your teeth, quenching.'\n'And he does not forbid you from drinking it ... While water quenches you and forbids you.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'By my father is a beloved I used to know ... Connecting with me, but his side turned away.'\n'Fragrant of speech with a musk scent that wafted ... From his mouth, pleasing the one who blames him.'\nSimile of the Mouth (Thaghr)\nAl-Buhturi gathered all that the mouth is likened to in one verse, saying:\n'As if she laughs revealing pearls ... Or silver or hail or chamomile.'\nAl-Samhari said regarding the beauty of the mouth:\n'And a white, lazy, playful virgin ... Delicious at the full night is her smelling.'\n'As if the flash of lightning is between me and her ... When her smiling appeared from some of the houses.'\nAl-Nabigha said:\n'She reveals with the two primaries of a thicket pigeon ... Coldness (teeth) whose gums were sprinkled with antimony.'\n'Like the chamomile on the morning after its sky (rain) ... Its tops dried and its bottom is moist.'\nIt is desirable for the color of the gum to incline to blackness.\nJarir said:\n'She runs the Siwak on a bright [mouth] as if it is ... Hail descending from the backs of clouds.'\nJarir said:\n'And possessing Shanab (lustrous teeth), pure, the soul knows that it ... Even if not tasted, thin of gums, is sweet.'\n'Al-Shanab': Thinness/Luster of teeth. 'Al-Hamash': Lean. Thus the gum is described with leanness.\nAnother said similar:\n'As if upon her canine teeth is wine mixed ... With dew water at the end of the night, a morning drink.'\n'And I did not taste it except with my eye discerning ... Just as lightning was watched in the highest cloud.'\nSimilar is the saying of Umarah:\n'As if on her canine teeth is the arousal of slumber ... A pool of icy water shining in a hollow.'\n'An eye contemplates, not resting if it sees ... And a heart, and what informs you is more poetic (aware) than a heart.'\nShaqiq bin Sulayk said:\n'And she smiles revealing dark-gummed, spaced teeth ... Created of the incisors with sweetness and coldness.'\nBashar said:\n'O best of people in saliva, untested ... Except the testimony of the tips of Siwaks.'\nIts completion is what follows:\n'You visited us once in time, a single time ... A second, and do not make it the egg of the rooster.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'And I did not taste it except by watching her smiling ... And how many a sight informs you of a good report.'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding such thought:\n'She gives you her logic so you know that it ... With the harvest of its sweetness passes by her mouth.'\nAl-Atawi said:\n'Possessor of two soft cheeks stingy with what is in them of apples ... And incisors and saliva and a stream.'\n'Of wine and a garden of chamomile.'\nAnother said:\n'And she smiles revealing two strings of pearls, their spacers are ... Mixtures of ruby approached by wine.'\nChapter 19 On the Speech of Women\nFrom the beautiful simile in the speech of women is the saying of Dhu al-Rumma:\n'A speech like the taste of honey, sweet are its beginnings ... And its ends are the colocynth short of the prohibitions.'\nAl-Akhtal said:\n'And I may converse with Layla while she is playful ... The falling of ornaments, my needs and my secrets.'\nAbu Dahbal al-Jumahi said:\n'And you see a coquetry in her, if she spoke ... She left the daughters of his heart inclined.'\n'Like the falling of the fresh dates from the ... Branches, neither scattering nor plucking.'\nSimilar is the saying of Ibn Ahmad:\n'She places the speech in its places ... And her speech afterwards possesses strength.'\nAl-Shammakh said:\n'A white woman, the neighbors do not dislike her appearance ... Nor is the sword of the Qayl (king) unsheathed by her mouth.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'And we obtained scraps of a speech as if it is ... The harvest of bees mixed with the water of pools.'\nTha'lab recited to us for Abu al-Amaythal:\n'I met the daughter of Al-Sahmi, Zaynab, at 'Afir ... While we were in Ihram on the evening of the tenth of the ten.'\n'So she spoke two words to me, like snow was one of them ... And another on a tablet hotter than embers.'\nOne was the meeting and the other the farewell.\nAnother said, who is Al-Shammakh:\n'And the nearness of separation hurried us, and between us ... Was a speech like the breathing of two sick people, disturbing.'",

    "text": "'A speech, if meat were roasted by its heat ... Raw, it would come to his companions cooked.'\nSimilar is the saying of the other:\n'She says to me while lightening the howdah ... A beautiful, good, smooth saying.'\n'If meat were cooked by it, it would be cooked.'\nIbn Abi Rabi'ah said:\n'And indeed there runs between us when we meet ... A speech having embroidery like the embroidery of cloaks.'\n'A speech like the falling of rain on the drought, heals ... With it from passion inside the heart, kind.'\nAl-Mubarrad recited to us:\n'And her speech is like the rain heard by ... A shepherd of years that followed in drought.'\n'So he listened hoping it to be a rain ... And says out of joy: O Lord.'\nAl-Qatami said:\n'So they cast a saying with which they hit ... The locations of water from the thirsty possessor of thirst.'\nBashar said:\n'And as if the return of her speech ... Is pieces of gardens clothed in flowers.'\n'And as if under her tongue ... Is Harut blowing magic into it.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'Her words almost, from recognizing distance ... Out of the delicacy of complaint, became tears.'\nChapter 20 On the Heaviness of the Buttocks\nAnother said regarding the heaviness of the buttocks:\n'She walks and her buttocks weigh her down ... So as if she is walking backwards.'\nSimilar is the saying of the other:\n'Braided of the top, a sand dune is her half ... If she walks, what is behind her makes her sit.'\nAl-Mu'ammil exaggerated in describing the buttocks, saying:\n'Who has seen the like of my love ... Resembling the full moon when it appears.'\n'She enters today, then enter ... Her buttocks tomorrow.'\nFrom the beautiful simile in that is the saying of Abu Nukhayla:\n'As if of her when she bends the girdle ... Two dunes of sand leaned on two dunes of sand.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'And sand like the hips of virgins I crossed ... While the dark nights covered it.'\nThis is from the inverted simile because they say: As if her hips are dunes of sand, as some of them said:\n'And white women, fresh of faces, as if they ... Wrapped themselves below the waist-wrappers with the sands of Alij.'\nAl-Tammar said (Munsarih Meter):\n'Her last tires her first ... So some of her is unjust to some.'\nAbd al-Wahhab al-Sandubi took this meaning and said:\n'He stood and the softness of his sides almost ... Was broken by the buttocks from his rising.'\n'And how can he hope for justice from others ... While some of him wronged some?'\nAl-Harith bin Khalid said:\n'She rises with difficulty, her buttocks weighing her down ... The action of the weak rising with the load.'\nFrom the free speech in this chapter is the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n'They returned what the waists lightened of it to ... What is in the waist-wrappers, so they found the buttocks heavy.'\nAnother said:\n'Her buttocks became huge so they hurt her waist ... And her sash is anxious like the heart of the lover.'\nThe leanness of the flank and the looseness of the sash are considered beautiful by them. Al-Ta'i said regarding that:\n'Of slenderness, if the anklets were made ... A clarity for her, the anklets would roam on her.'\nAl-Najim said in the reverse of this mocking a songstress:\n'Her anklets are forever in clamor ... Her sash is suppressed, silent.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mentioning women:\n'And if they wear anklets ... They lie to the names of anklets (Khalkhal - implies looseness).'\n'Their anklets refuse legs weighed down, languid.'\nKhalid bin Yazid bin Muawiyah said:\n'The anklets of women roam, and I do not see ... For Ramlah an anklet roaming nor a heart.'\nUbaydullah bin Ubaydullah said:\n'Salma, and what is Salma? She surpasses desires ... And beauty in descriptions and colors.'\n'Her sash envies her anklet ... As a hungry one envies a satiated one.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'The desire of your eyes from him is between a sun of forenoon ... And a soft one of the branches of the Ban tree, succulent.'\n'His upper parts lightened and his lower parts wrapped ... As if the Ban tree crafted his two halves for us.'\nHe has:\n'She gave him my eye the slumber ... So she rewarded it from him with tears.'\n'A gazelle, as if in his waist ... From his leanness is thirst and hunger.'\nChapter 21 On the Breast\nFrom the beautiful simile in the breast is the saying of Amr bin Kulthum:\n'And two breasts like the box of ivory, soft ... Protected from the palms of touches.'\nAl-Hasan bin al-Takhtakh said regarding two breasts:\n'Or like halves of two boxes of ivory ... You resembled two breasts truly.'\nBashar said:\n'And the breast, you think it drowsy or lazy ... And it swayed a swaying not broken.'\nAl-Qallakh said:\n'As if the color of eggs in the nest ... Is your color except the yellowness of saffron.'\n'The dome of the kidneys is the knot of the breast.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'Chests above them are boxes of ivory ... And pearls adorned by good arrangement.'\n'The sayers say when they see it ... Is this pearl from these boxes?'",

    "text": "This is taken from the saying of Abdullah bin Abi al-Samt bin Marwan in a poem of his (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'As if the breasts when they appear ... And necklaces adorn the chests with them.'\n'Are boxes of ivory hidden ... Holding much of pearls.'\nHe has on the tongue of a man called Hamdan bin Salim:\n'And breasts, swelling ... Like the corners of bookcases.'\nAli bin al-Jahm said, although there is no simile in it:\n'I was longing and nothing blocks me ... From you except a barrier preventing me.'\n'Rising in the chest, angry at ... The domes of the belly and the folding of the creases.'\n'It fills the palm and does not separate it ... So if you bent it, it does not bend.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding songstresses:\n'Feeding their children breasts ... Swelling like the best pomegranate.'\n'Full as if they are flowing ... While they are empty of the flow of milk.'\nChapter 22 On Songstresses\nFrom the beautiful simile regarding a songstress is the saying of some of them:\n'And Ukasha made easy from the hand of a girl, as if her fingertips ... Are of silver that tipped jujubes.'\n'And as if her right hand when she spoke with it ... Meets a calculation on her left hand.'\nLike the first verse is for Abu Nuwas:\n'O moon whom a funeral surrounded ... Wailing with sorrow among peers.'\n'He weeps, so he sheds pearls from his eye ... And slaps the rose with jujube.'\nCombining good simile and close metaphor is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi describing female singers:\n'And songstresses as if they are mothers ... Affectionate to their sons, compassionate.'\n'Having children while they did not carry a fetus ... Breastfeeding while they are not possessing milk.'\n'Feeding their children breasts ... Swelling like the best pomegranate.'\n'Full as if they are flowing ... While they are empty of the flow of milk.'\n'Every child is called by various names ... Between Oud, Mizhar, and Kiran.'\n'His mother interprets for him forever ... While he is apparently rich from the interpreter.'\n'He was given wisdom and clarity as a boy ... Like Jesus son of Mary, possessor of Paradise.'\nAl-Ta'i recited:\n'So as if he is in her lap a child of hers ... She hugged him between ribs and chest.'\n'At times she tickles his belly, so if he slips ... She rubs an ear of the ears for him.'\nAl-Najim said regarding a songstress (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'When she embraced her Oud, she blamed ... And cooed to him the best of expression.'\n'She tickles his belly slowly ... So he brings us amazing laughter.'\n'And she rubs his ear if he slips ... And in truth is the discipline of one who sinned.'\n'And people have disciplined his likes ... But he is the head of who was disciplined.'\nAl-Hamduni said in likening the Oud:\n'And a speaker with a tongue having no conscience ... As if he is a thigh attached to a foot.'\n'He reveals the conscience of another in speech just as ... The writing with the pen reveals the conscience of another.'\nAnother said:\n'As if his statue is a leg on a foot ... Attached to a thigh separated from the buttock.'\n'His ears, from him, have gathered four ... Answering four in the hand of a worker.'\n'So this is nasal, and this has humming ... And that is clear, and this has like hoarseness.'\nAbu Malik al-A'raj said in describing the Oud:\n'And working speakers from Kiran ... With a slit of thin eggs.'\n'He has two eyes under his throat ... One of them resembled the moon of waning.'\n'If she sang old or new ... Then the pocket has no protector from your palms.'\nAhmad bin Yusuf said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Leave the Oud from us, how hard it is ... And move to revelry and the wind's soughing.'\n'With a bright-faced like the full moon in his cheek ... If he is in a gathering, he shakes it.'\nIbn Abi Awn al-Katib opposed him saying (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Lo, how ugly is the Duff, how foolish it is ... And oh for the Oud, how noble it is.'\n'Its resting places are from the throats of songstresses ... To the limit of their luxurious thighs.'\n'And playing in the knot of its strings are ... Fingertips polished, slender.'\n'Like the touch of the physician the pulse of veins ... For the knowledge of the healthy and the sick.'\n'Its strings whisper to you with the voice ... So their tongues fulfill its letters for you.'\nLike that is the saying of Al-Najim regarding a songstress (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Her playing was good from Atib ... And increased as her singing came.'\n'If she intended the tune before singing ... Her Oud recited her poetry to us.'\nHe said regarding a flute player:\n'Qatul did not attend us except ... She kindled our burning with her enchanting.'\n'She sings loudly with the voice, it is said it comes ... As if in her flute is a tongue.'\nFrom good metaphor is his saying regarding a songstress:\n'The songs of Atib come ... Always with the joys of souls.'",

    "text": "'She sings, so we dance with heads ... For her, and pipe with cups.'\nSimilar is his saying (Mujtath Meter):\n'Salamah bin Sa'id ... Masters urging the wine.'\n'If he sings, we pipe ... Upon him with cups.'\nFrom the beautiful simile in this chapter is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\n'Bid'ah (Innovation) is to me like her name, an innovation ... There is no doubt in that nor deception.'\n'As if the delicacy of her heard (voice) ... Is the delicacy of a complaint that preceded a tear.'\n'She sang and did not need a piper ... Does the morning need a candle?'\n'And the flute escorted her wonders ... Like a doe overlooking a hill.'\n'As if a crown increased in joy ... Not a turban covered nor a baldness.'\nAl-Najim said regarding his saying \"delicacy of a complaint that preceded a tear\":\n'Hazwa created among us with her charm ... Royal singing thinner than complaint.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'She extended to you a fingertip like a worm ... Complaining of separation and an eye like a spring.'\n'Her words almost, from recognizing distance ... Out of the delicacy of complaint, became tears.'\nAbu Uthman said regarding a songstress (Munsarih Meter):\n'Atib and her Mizhar did not sing loudly ... But we trusted in amusement and joy.'\n'She has singing like healing in a body ... Exhausted by the length of sickness and grief.'\n'The wine worships it, so as long as she sings ... Our pitcher is prostrating on the cup.'\nAnother said:\n'When her Mizhar yearned for her ... And the noble drinkers yearned for its voice.'\n'And they inclined ears towards her until ... As if they, while not sleeping, were asleep.'\nIn good listening to singing, Al-Najim says:\n'We are silent if she intends her singing ... Our silence if the preacher spoke.'\nA Bedouin said:\n'The air has stagnated until ... As if it is an ear listening.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And my boon companions in youth and old age ... Generous souls destroyed their wealth.'\n'Between their cups is a short conversation ... It is magic and what is other than it is speech.'\n'And singing that hastens wine with wine ... As the pigeon cooed in the branches.'\n'And as if the cupbearers among the boon companions ... Are Alifs standing between the lines.'\nLikening singing to the cooing of the pigeon is an old circulated meaning, and the condition is presenting the rare. Al-Najim said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'If you distinguish the people of singing ... You distinguish her as the most skilled, the best.'\n'She shakes the poetry with her melodies ... As the East wind shook the branch.'\nHe also has:\n'The tones of Hubba did not resemble ... Except the embracing of loved ones.'\n'How lovely is Hubba, indeed she ... Is to our joy always beloved.'\nHe also said:\n'She did not sing but a worry was uncovered ... From a heart and sorrows cleared.'\n'She excels the singers in goodness and skill ... Like hearing excels seeing.'\nHe also said regarding a songstress:\n'God revived Abu Yahya, for he ... Revives us with our hearing from Atib.'\n'She started singing to us, so we thought she ... Out of her joy at her singing, sings to us.'\nFrom good metaphor in this meaning is his saying (Munsarih Meter):\n'Atib and her Mizhar did not speak ... Except we remained working for the wine.'\n'Her strings seek worries with strings ... So they do not recover, she kills them.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mourning the slave girl of Umm Ali bint al-Rasibi called Bustan (Munsarih Meter):\n'Oh for that annihilation from a calamity ... Capable over all hearts.'\n'She became, from dwelling in their graves ... The dwelling of expensive perfumes in the oil containers of beds.'\n'O drinking place that was for me without turbidity ... O night talk that was for me without sleeplessness.'\n'You became in the soil not outweighing ... By it, while you outweigh the full moon.'\nAl-Najim said mourning Aja'ib, the slave girl of Ibn Marwan:\n'The soil became by her neighborhood ... The most fragrant of paths and drinking places.'\n'She occupied her grave the occupation ... Of the king the thrones of processions.'\n'O pearl that was illuminating ... For an onlooker from every side.'\nLike that is the saying of Ibrahim bin al-Abbas:\n'A pearl, wherever it was turned, it shone ... And a smelling place, wherever it was smelled, it diffused.'\nAl-Najim said regarding a songstress:\n'Singing more delicious than the beginning ... Of the eye in its slumber.'\n'Sweeter and more desirable than the wish ... Of a soul in the truth of its hope.'\nHe also said:\n'She has amazing, entertaining singing ... It does what wine does.'\n'It makes the ear yearn for her singing ... As the eye yearns for greenery.'\n'As if the joy of one who visited her ... Is the joy of one to whom the Qumrah (bird) flew.'\n'If Ishaq sang after her ... You would think the listener is in mockery.'",

    "text": "'Rare in all her melodies ... Not like the one who is rare in rarity.'\nHe has mocking a songstress in the reverse of this meaning:\n'I wondered at her, woe to her, how she does not ... Get charity in rarity.'\nThis is taken from the saying of Ibn Munadhir mocking a judge:\n'Oh wonder at Khalid, how ... He errs among us once by being right.'\nAbu Uthman said regarding a songstress (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Atib excelled in singing ... And increased and exceeded the excellent.'\n'Her listener glorifies (God) if she sings ... So her voices are the rosary of the listener.'\nIncluded in this chapter, even if it has no simile, is what Yahya bin Ali wrote to Ibn al-Mu'tazz:\n'My master, indeed we have Ziryab ... She filled us with narration and correctness.'\n'She wore out her evil and her benevolence in hearing ... Increases in newness and youth.'\nIbn al-Jahm said regarding Nabatah, the slave girl of Ibn Hammad:\n'His dwelling is desolate except of plants (Nabat) ... And his signs and ruins are erased.'\n'Every thing she does has become clear from her ... Except singing, its Nasb and its Raml.'\n'So she is as he sent truly his likeness ... You have nothing of your Sheikh except his deed.'\nChapter 23 On Satire of Songstresses\nFrom the beautiful simile in satire of songstresses is the saying of Ibn Uthman regarding a flute player:\n'The flute of Qatul is killing ... With the stench from it, raising dust.'\n'It resembles in my view a sewer pipe ... Mounted in an exit.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a flute player:\n'And possessor of a flute, bright her face ... Beloved of glances and coquetry.'\n'As if she kisses a child of hers ... She committed adultery with from the children of Zanj.'\nHe said mocking a flute player (Munsarih Meter):\n'Your time met you with a flute player ... Striking fire in the face of every joy.'\n'Win the edge of her jaws when she blew ... That is more fitting for her than the flute.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking a songstress:\n'Green like the scorpion in yellowness ... Freckled like the snake in its spots.'\n'In the voice from her is always a hoarseness ... Making me imagine she has madness (Khabtah).'\n'Small of build but she is ... Older in the world than wheat.'\n'If she sees a huge penis ... She falls to it saying: Put it down.'\nAl-Najim said mocking a songstress:\n'And a songstress I cursed, Qunut ... The best of her sounds is silence.'\n'She errs if she plays strings (Khuyutan) ... For the blackness in her head is threads (Khuyut).'\n'Consumption-struck of all except a belly ... Heavy, so she is a spider.'\n'And she swallows provisions and puffs ... So she is, of the two meanings, a whale.'\nSimilar is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi regarding a songstress:\n'I lost you, O Kunayzah, every loss ... And tasted death, the first who dies.'\n'For you were given a wide mouth and vulva ... As if you are from both your ends a whale.'\nAl-Basir said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Your singing to me kills joy ... And your playing the Oud revives grief.'\n'I have not seen before you a songstress ... Singing so I think she is wailing.'\nWere it not that our purpose is rare similes, we would have mentioned a collection of satire for female singers: And we will mention it in the other book.\nFrom the rare similes in connected verses is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\n'Her smell while she is alive is the smell of a dead ... Who spent the night in the grave then exhumation revealed him.'\n'And you see her seeking concealment with perfume and litharge ... Secretly her stench while she breaks wind.'\n'Her dusty pockmarked face resembles ... Yesterday's plaster whose top a drizzle hit.'\n'Smallpox, what is the matter with her, and it is a flaw ... Every trace in that face is an engraving.'\n'Every thing erased her ornaments so it is decoration ... Every thing the dust hid so it is furnishing.'\n'She exchanged plaits and locks for ... Nose hair in which is a nest for two chicks.'\n'She coos and her playing is like braying ... Like the braying of the donkey whose foal cooed to him.'\n'I said mocking her when she appeared ... You are Bilqis if a throne helped you.'\n'Her fuckers do not count the rope ... She is more worthy to be fucked and sprinkled.'\nThis is of good simile regarding smallpox. Another said, who is Al-Burani, in the opposite of that:\n'As if traces of pockmarking on his cheek ... Are tens estimated in the pages of a paper-maker.'\nAbu Bakr bin al-Sarraj al-Nahwi said regarding Abu al-Fath bin Masruq al-Balkhi, who had smallpox:\n'A moon got smallpox, when he became straight ... It increased him in beauty and increased my worries.'\n'As if he sang to the sun of the forenoon ... So it dotted him out of joy with stars.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking Abu Sulayman al-Tunburi (Munsarih Meter):\n'And a listener whose separation I did not lack ... For it is a blessing of blessings.'\n'My day lengthens when I am coupled with him ... As if I am fasting and did not fast.'",

Drink my cup mixed with my blood.'\n'Small children are terrified of him ... If one of them cries and does not sleep.'\nHe has regarding a songstress, and he is one of the predecessors in satire:\n'I witnessed in some of what I witnessed a singer ... As if her day is two days in a day.'\n'She continues throwing upon who her gathering comprised ... A saying heavy on the ears like blame.'\n'I remained drinking by pounds not out of joy ... At it but seeking intoxication and sleep.'\nAbu Uthman said mocking Kura'ah:\n'A songstress who does not shake hands with the ... Drinkers except with her leg.'\n'What did people see in the songstresses ... Despite the weakness of her mind?'\n'Her head from its emptiness ... Is empty like her drum.'\nHe also has:\n'You have a head among heads, air ... Empty, the weakness of its mind is not hidden.'\n'So tap it if the drum is missing one day ... For it is to me more resonant than it and clearer.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding a songstress:\n'To the kohl and saffron in her face ... And the Jiljawnat are false testimonies.'\n'Her limbs call to fucking her ... As if she is created from clitorises.'\nHe also has:\n'If she lies on her back, she is flatter than a mattress ... And if she stoops, she is firmer than a bed.'\n'As if the legs of the Throne transformed ... Into her legs in the battlefield of penises.'\nHe also has:\n'Shantaf fell short and decreased and humbled ... Except a clitoris she drags like the spleen.'\n'A female monkey, a single one, a pebble, a date pit ... An owl, a garlic, old bones.'\n'Lean is the face of her anus, the face of a Turk ... But the heart of the neighborhood of lion cubs.'\n'Her Amr shouted at me when she flirted with me ... Do not stop at the effaced ruins.'\nAbu Uthman said regarding a songstress:\n'The onlooker witnesses what displeases him ... Of her drooping red eyelid.'\n'If she appears letting down her hair ... You think her a rooster with a beak.'\nAl-Massisi said:\n'I saw Nasr sitting playing ... So I stood up fleeing from his loneliness.'\n'Because there bark from his Oud ... At you from his strings, dogs.'\n'And the boon companion thinks in his throat ... Is a chicken strangled by a fox.'\n'My wonder is not at him but I ... Am more wondering at the one who admires him.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding a songstress:\n'A cursed songstress because of whom ... Amusement was rejected together by who rejected it.'\n'Her Oud recoils in her lap ... Always from a kicking kid.'\n'And if she sings you see in her throat ... Every vein like the house of the termite.'\n'And she turns the Za' into Dad, so if ... She says 'Izah' (admonition), she says 'Idah'.' \nIbn al-Mu'tazz said in the reverse of this describing a termite that fell into a book:\n'She builds tubes for herself in it, paths ... Like veins you see no defect in.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding a songstress:\n'Lend her an ear and listen ... To the coldest of what Kura'ah sang.'\n'Squat of creation, her hump ... Her stature is the stature of a bubble.'\n'She remains in the shirt from shortness ... Like a small bird (Sa'wah) in the hollow of a cage (Qaffa'ah).' \n'She has a gray-haired, wrinkled vulva ... It turned gray and does not leave suckling.'\n'Inverted of labia, smiling ... It is nothing but the pocket of an armor.'\nHe has similar regarding another:\n'I thought my trousers were wide on me ... I thought them nothing but trousers.'\nDi'bil said:\n'Indeed Ibn Zayt has a songstress ... Who exceeded Satan in ugliness.'\n'Black, wide-mouthed, having hair ... As if it is ants on a sackcloth.'\n'If she appeared uncovered in the forenoon ... The break of dawn would turn black from it.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a flute player:\n'And a black woman, grasping every penis ... Crawling to the neighbors at all times.'\n'And she reveals the veil from the beauties of her face ... Like a dung beetle upon which are two cowrie shells shining.'\nIbn al-Musayyib said:\n'And a songstress colder than his ice ... The soul remains in clamor from her.'\n'As if she is from her stench a garlic ... But in color a citron.'\n'As if she, while the tattoo is in her hand ... Is arsenic written with minium.'\n'Black of the door of the hole, gray-haired ... To everyone who uncovers it, a clamor.'\n'As if her anus is a coal ... Upon which a player crushed his snow.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding Darirah, the slave girl of the effeminate:\n'Woe to you, O stature of the Brestug (game piece?) ... You are not, by Allah, coquettish.'\n'O Kaaba erected for fucking ... But it is not pilgrimed to.'\n'We fucked, so we fucked of you an armor ... From her front and the rear is opened.'",

And whose exhausted anus is a Falujah (plowed land?).'\nChapter 24 On Satire of Women\nConnected to the satire of songstresses is what women were satirized with. Among the good of that is the saying of Di'bil (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'I saw a gazelle and she looked out ... So she revealed to my eyes a belt.'\n'Short of build, squat ... She rolls in walking like the hazelnut.'\n'As if a cubit on her palm ... When she uncovered, is the tail of the spoon.'\n'She draws her eyebrow with ink ... And ties a pad on her buttocks.'\n'And a nose stuck on her face ... Short of nostrils like the pistachio.'\n'And two breasts, a breast like an acorn ... And another like the filled waterskin.'\n'And a mouth, if she grimaced, you thought it ... The joints of a closed table leg.'\nA Bedouin said regarding his wife:\n'And she cannot use kohl due to the narrowness of her eye ... If she tried, it became above the sockets.'\n'And in her eyebrows is a fleece for a sack ... If shaved, they would be three sacks.'\n'And two breasts, as for one, it is a banana ... And another in it is a waterskin for the traveler.'\nAnother said:\n'The buttocks are lean, her shoulders are hobbled ... As if the manger of a sheep is in her collarbones.'\n'And the breast of her is draped on the thighs ... As if it is a waterskin whose content has flowed.'\nDi'bil said (Munsarih Meter):\n'As if her palm when she dyed it ... Is the claws of the hawk stained with blood.'\nAbu al-Najm recited to Hisham regarding his daughter:\n'As if Zhullamah, sister of Shayban ... Is an orphan while her parents are alive.'\n'The head is all lice and nits ... And there is nothing in the legs but threads.'\n'So she is the one from whom Satan is terrified.'\nSo he gifted him one hundred and fifty dinars and said to him: Put this in place of the two threads.\nDi'bil bin Ali said:\n'Cut me off, O creation of the nail ... And connect me with the length of distance of the visit.'\n'A deficient chin and a long nose ... And a forehead like the teak of the moneychanger.'\nAnother said regarding his wife:\n'I seek refuge in Allah from a scrawny, obscene one ... As if her two clothes were hung on a stick.'\n'Her waist does not hold the rope when she girds ... And in the tailbone and the tendon is sharpness.'\n'I seek refuge in Allah from a leg that has malice ... As if it is from the iron of the blacksmith, a skewer.'\nAnother said:\n'When she laughed, wrinkles roamed as if they were ... Dewlaps of a chameleon in Hawran, sunning.'\n'As if her jugular veins are two ropes of a pulley ... Twisted from skin of raw hide, dry.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'On the outside of her face are creases ... And two-thirds of her face is chin.'\n'And teeth like the feathers of the ... Duck, between their roots is rot.'\nDi'bil said regarding a woman:\n'Wide-mouthed, ugly, her laughing reveals the liver ... Aquiline in width and big-eyed in length.'\n'She has a mouth, the meeting of its jaws ... Her nape, as if her lip was cut from an elephant.'\nAl-Najim said mocking the husband of an old woman (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'You will envy from her when she comes to you ... With furs of a monkey and backs of a ghoul.'\n'And you embraced from her the awn of a spike ... Meeting the bedfellow with the like of arrowheads.'\nDi'bil said:\n'May Allah not bless a night that brings me near ... Except a lying together like rubbing with rope.'\n'I touched her nakedness but my hand did not fall ... From what I touched except on a peg.'\n'In every limb of hers is a crack she hits with ... The side of the bedfellow so he becomes weak of body.'\nA Bedouin said to his wife:\n'An index finger for the husband and the mother-in-law ... As if her legs are the trotters of a sheep.'\n'In a foot as if it is a shovel.'\nDi'bil said:\n'Your temples have turned gray and your chest is dry ... And the chest of you is like the breast of the Tanbur.'\n'O you whose hugger spends the night as if he is ... In a lice-infested prison and in a pillory.'\n'I kissed her and found the sting of her saliva ... On the tongue like the sting of the wasp.'\nAbu Ubayda recited for a Bedouin regarding his wife (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'I was afflicted with a virago like the stick ... More thieving and malicious than a Kundash (magpie?).'\n'She has the hair of a monkey when adorned ... And a face like the speckled egg of the sandgrouse.'\n'And a leg an anklet rattles on ... Like the leg of the chicken or thinner.'\n'She has a knee like the hoof of the gazelle ... More intensely yellow than the apricot.'\n'As if the warts on her face ... When she unveiled are the seeds of currants.'\nIbn al-Rumi said (Munsarih Meter):\n'Sprinkled with her moles so her skin ... Is patterned like the skin of the leopard.'",

Like the grain of nigella in Shiraz (cheese/milk).'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking a servant:\n'Freckles upon yellowness so you see him ... Like the specks of flies in pollen.'\nAl-Mu'adhdhal bin Ghaylan said:\n'And a knee like the egg of the ostrich ... As if the growth of hair painted.'\n'Upon it is nigella on a round loaf (Furni).'\nDi'bil said:\n'Black, wide-mouthed, having hair ... As if it is ants on a sackcloth.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'And she has a thicklip (Ka'thab) like the hoof of a gazelle ... In it is a crack as if it is a scratch.'\nChapter 25 On the Nut Bow (Qaws al-Bunduq)\nFrom the beautiful simile in the nut bow is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\n'As if its back and the horns that are in it ... Even if the eye does not find them except by tracking.'\n'Is a sprinkler of crushed saffron upon a stone ... Upon which the creeping ants crawled, advancing.'\n'It has a beginning obedient to the hands and an end ... If you task it with drowning (full draw) in it, it resists.'\nHe took this meaning from the saying of Al-Shamikh regarding the bow:\n'So he tasted, and it gave him of softness a side ... Sufficient, and it has a barrier preventing the arrow from drowning.'\nIbn al-Rumi also said:\n'In it is available for its thrower the targets as if ... The caller of death called them for him so they heard.'\n'The birds turn towards it a seeing eye ... Like your eyes, nay sharper in intelligence and faster.'\n'Squared, divided from its ingots ... Like the statue of the idol's house, sufficient for you as a square.'\n'It has a wailing, more fitting for the one it hits ... And more worthy of wailing is the one who was pained.'\nThis resembles his saying regarding a woman:\n'The lover complains and she meets while she is complaining ... Like the bow wounding the targets while it is ringing.'\nAl-Shammakh said describing a bow:\n'When the archers twang from it, it hums ... The humming of a bereaved mother pained by funerals.'\nTha'lab recited describing the bow:\n'And it, if you twang from it, coos ... The humming of the bereaved mother, she refused, she does not sleep.'\nHe also recited to us:\n'You hear after the pulling and stringing ... In its two curved ends the ringing of the Tanbur.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'The sorrowful one was destined to bridle his bow ... With the smallest of the curved back, not unarmed.'\n'So he deposited in it an arrow like the comb of combers ... Which they sent into a parting so it penetrated.'\n'Slow if you hastened the release of its notch ... But if you slowed in the pull, it hastened.'\nAnother said regarding the bow and arrows:\n'I prepared a mute one for stabbing and a coat of mail ... Loose, and a spear from the wood of Kharsan.'\n'And joints of Shawhat wood, as if its yearning ... In the palm is the wailing of a bereaved ringing one.'\n'And long arrowheads, blue, as if their blades ... Were sharpened by the flames of fire.'\n'Their notches are the filling of the quiver as if they are ... Mouths of chicks of small birds (Nughran).'\nChapter 26 On the Sword\nFrom the good simile in the sword is the saying of Ishaq bin Khalaf:\n'He threw by the side of his waist ... Sharper than the decreed term.'\n'And as if the sprinkling of dust ... Upon it is the breaths of winds.'\nImru' al-Qays said:\n'Pillowing a sharp sword whose edges ... In its blade are like the track of ants.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And he stripped from its scabbards every thin sword ... If the palm unsheathed it, it almost flowed.'\n'You see upon its blade the firind (water pattern) as if ... The blacksmith breathed into it while it is polished.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'And how can the one whom a sword settled his worry sleep the night ... Like the color of salt, white, sharp.'\n'You lied, by the House of Allah, you will not take it ... By force as long as the sword has a hilt.'\nMansur al-Namari said:\n'A male (sword), by its luster the blood as if ... It covers the men with soaking purple.'\n'And you see the edges of its two blades as if they are ... Salt scattered from behind the armored one.'\nAnother said:\n'And a sharp sword cutting the necks of the neck ... As if its two sides, salt is sprinkled on them.'\n'And the crawl of ants crept in the tracks of ants.'\nAbu al-Hawl said:\n'A sword on the morning of fright, passing as if it is ... From Allah in seizing souls a messenger.'\n'The pupil of the eye floats in its shimmering ... And swims in its clothes and roams.'\n'As if armies of ants broke upon it ... Horns of locusts, between them are vengeances.'\n'As if upon its firind is the wave of a deep sea ... Shortening in its shallow water and lengthening.'\n'If death stretches in its wakefulness ... Then there must be a soul there flowing.'\n'And if it glances at the heroes or shakes hands with the necks ... A slain one will sprawl one day among them.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Amidst the army in his palm is a male ... Sharp sword as if in its blade are freckles.'",

And if he is hit, he has no killing spot.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And I have a sharp sword in which deaths are hidden ... So it is not unsheathed except to shed blood.'\n'You see upon its two blades the firind as if it is ... A remnant of a cloud thinned without sky.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'The best of what the palm held fast to is a sharp ... Male sword whose edge is soft of shaking.'\n'You did not contemplate it with your eyes except ... Its two pages trembled without shaking.'\n'Its like frightened the brave to the armor ... So he rose with it over every spoil.'\n'He does not care if his two blades were determined ... In a notch or passed beyond a notch.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'In his palm is a sharp sword, if he shook it ... You thought it trembling from his fear.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'The sayers say when they see it ... For a matter, the armors were overcome.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And I shook a Hindi sword ... Sharp of edges, thinned.'\n'And when it entered the head of the ... Tyrant, it traveled and hurried.'\n'Sharp of edges like the stream ... Expelled the speck until it cleared.'\nA man from Tayy said:\n'And possessor of ridges as if it is the belly of a snake ... When the palm tested it with the bone, it persisted.'\nChapter 27 On Spears\nFrom the beautiful simile in spears is the saying of Antara:\n'They call Antara while the spears are as if they are ... Ropes of a well in the chest of the dark horse.'\nDuraid bin al-Simmah said:\n'So I came to him while the spears were picking at him ... Like the falling of the shuttles on the stretched weave.'\nAl-Ta'i excelled in their description even if there is no simile in it, which is his saying:\n'Straightened ones, they robbed the Romans of their blueness ... And the Arabs of their brownness and the lovers of slenderness.'\nThe Arabs say: As if so-and-so is a spear. A Bedouin came to a club, so those in it moved to make room for him. He said: Only the planting place of a spear suffices me.\nMuzarrid said regarding the spear:\n'And a steady one, soft of joints, as if ... A flow of oil covered it.'\n'Solid, if shaken its back quivered ... As the snake of the seeking sands quivered.'\n'It has a shaking head, sharp of edge, as if it is ... A crescent appeared in the darkness of the night, emaciated.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'As if the Lahdhami spearheads in the forenoon ... Are wicks lit at the ends of the Rudayni spear.'\nLayla al-Akhyaliyyah said:\n'Indeed Al-Khali' and his group from Amir ... Are like the heart clothed in a chest and a windpipe.'\n'And a people, the tying of horses is in the middle of their houses ... And blue spearheads imagined to be stars.'\nIbn Ju'ayl al-Taghlibi said:\n'I shook a Rudayni as if its spearhead ... Is the light of a flame not ignited with smoke.'\nDi'bil said:\n'And a brown spear, in its head is a blue point ... Like the tongue of the thirsty snake.'\nAnother said:\n'My carrying the spear has prolonged until as if it is ... Upon my shoulder a branch growing from the tree.'\n'My tongue lengthens in the clan reconciling ... While on the day of hateful war it is silent.'\nSa'idah bin Ju'ayyah said:\n'So prepare a blue point on the spear as if it is ... In the darkness of gloom the light of a meteor.'\nChapter 28 On the Description of the Coat of Mail\nAbu Du'ad said in describing a coat of mail (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And I prepared for war a spacious one ... Shrinking in folding like the file.'\n'Its sleeves overflow on the man ... Like the overflow of the stream on the hard ground.'\nTha'lab recited:",

    "text": "'So I restrained him until I wore a wide coat ... Smooth like the color of the pool when wind blew and rained.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'How many a hero I duelled in the battle ... Upon him is a coat of mail you thought flowing.'\n'As if it is water running upon him ... Until when it disappeared in him, it froze.'\nHe has:\n'And coats of mail as if they are the mixed gray hair of the curly ... Oiled, in which combs get lost.'\nAnother said:\n'And a huge gathered army, its horses ... Are blood-stained in their manes and throats.'\n'Upon them are the degraded of the blacksmiths (armors) as if they are ... The eyes of vipers, their weave and rivets.'\nAnother said:\n'Its battalions weighed the mountains and clad ... Rings of iron so they showed its equipment.'\n'So you imagine the wave of the sea, some of it tilting ... To some, the flash of its rivets and its weave.'\nSalim al-Khasir said:\n'As if the bubbles of pools flowed upon them ... And it is nothing but the wide flowing coats of mail.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Where there is no aid except a sharp sword ... And a shield like the bubbles of water covering me.'\nTha'lab recited to us:\n'And a coat of mail mocking the blades ... As if it is from the slough of the snake (Hilal).'\nHe claimed 'Al-Hilal' is the snake. Muhammad bin Abd al-Malik al-Halabi took it and said:\n'I restrained its first with a true strike ... Cutting as the marked cloak is torn.'\n'And upon me is a wide-tailed one as if it is ... A slough with which the brave speckled snake clothed me.'\nMuzarrid bin Dirar said:\n'And a poured wide one, Tubba'i ... Its rivets shine, the broad arrows dislike it.'\n'Smooth like the back of the fish, no spearhead can pierce it ... Nor those entering wooden arrows.'\nMu'aqqir al-Bariqi said regarding helmets:\n'As if the ostriches of the desert laid eggs upon them ... And their eyes under the iron are staring.'\nSalamah bin Jandal said:\n'As if ostriches laid eggs over their heads ... To death is a lightning from Tihama shining.'\nChapter 29 On the Equality of Peers in War\nFrom the beautiful similes in the equality of peers in war is the saying of Muhalhil bin Rabi'ah:\n'As if we, in the morning, and the sons of our father ... By the side of Unayzah are two millstones of a turner.'\nHe also said similar to this:\n'They twanged the handles of bows and threatened ... Us as stallions threaten stallions.'\nZuhair took this meaning and said:\n'We stab them as long as they shoot, until if they stab ... He strikes, until if they strike, he embraces.'\nAnother said:\n'I approached him with a white Mashrafi sword ... As the shaker of hands approaches for greeting.'\nFrom the beautiful simile in advancing is the saying of Abu al-Atahiya:\n'As if you on the day of stabbing in war are only ... Fleeing from the peace that is behind you.'\n'As if deaths do not run in the battle ... When heroes meet except in your innocence.'\nQays bin al-Khatim said:\n'Whenever we fled, our worst fleeing was ... The turning of cheeks and the deviation of shoulders.'\n'The turning of cheeks while spears are engaged ... And feet do not leave during the striking.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding Abu Sa'id:\n'Indeed that heart was the heart of a peaceful man ... Even though that attire was the attire of a warrior.'\n'You hasten until one who witnessed the battle said ... Is it a meeting of enemies or a meeting of loved ones?'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'How many a depth of death whose wading is feared ... I ran in it the running of a thread in a hole.'\n'Until when it was said a term came to him ... I emerged from it with a dyed sword.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'And we were, when the destined luck deceived him ... The light of a morning lightning or the noise of a thunderer.'\n'Al-Fadl bin Yahya bin Khalid dropped upon him ... With sharp swords whose long baldric made him proud.'\n'In front of a purple army as if it is ... A shirt woven of spears and horses.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding the density of the army:\n'To Allah is your deed on the day of Babak, brave ... Hero, knocking on the doors of deaths.'\n'When he came to you leading a huge army ... Walking to him in density and crowds.'\n'You distributed them between spearheads and blades ... Until you showed their crowds a distribution.'\n'In a tight battlefield where you imagine the spears ... Between the ribs, if they bent, are ribs.'\nIbn al-Rumi said describing a battalion:\n'If a cloud pelted them in the open space ... Its pebbles would remain rolling upon them.'\nQays bin al-Khatim said similar to that, and it is its origin:\n'If you were to throw colocynth upon our helmets ... It would roll from a possessor of mark, convergent.'\n'Al-Sam' here is the lines of gold in the helmets. 'Al-Sam' in other than this place is death. Muslim bin al-Walid said regarding an army:\n'The open earth shines with it ... Like the night, its stars are the bars and spears.'",

    "text": "Similar to it is what Tha'lab recited for Bashar in likening two things in one verse. They claimed that Bashar said: When I heard the saying of Imru' al-Qays:\n'As if the hearts of birds, wet and dry ... At her nest, are jujubes and withered dates.'\nI strained my thought until I said:\n'As if the raising of dust above our heads ... And our swords are a night whose stars are falling.'\nMansur al-Namari said similar to this:\n'A night of dust, no sun nor moon ... Except your forehead and the sharpened spears.'\nFor some of them:\n'And he left their head with continuous striking ... And stabbing not weak nor boring.'\n'As if his spearhead in his shoulders ... Is a meteor behind a cursed devil.'\nAnother said regarding horses:\n'Their hooves wove a sky above them ... They made their spearheads the stars of their sky.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And the dust covered the sky until it was as if it were ... Smoke and the tips of spears were sparks.'\nMuslim bin al-Walid said:\n'The Caliph unsheathed a sword from Banu Matar ... Passing, piercing bodies and heads.'\n'Like Time, not turning away from what he intends ... He has encompassed people with compulsion and favor.'\n'He executes deaths as his spearheads execute ... As if in his saddle is a full moon and a lion.'\nA Bedouin said:\n'We throw raids at Abs and Tayy ... And Tamim and Madhhij have fled from us.'\n'With invasion like the lapping of the wolf, coming early and returning ... And marching like the chest of the sword, not bending.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding Abu Sa'id:\n'Their vanguard if the army headed out raiding ... And their rearguard if the army headed back returning.'\n'Kings who count spears as staffs ... When they shake them, and coats of mail as inner shirts.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'A people, if they get angry at their enemies ... Drag iron as spearheads and coats of mail.'\n'And as if our hands scare away from them ... Birds that were landing on the bodies.'\nMuslim bin al-Walid said:\n'Overlooking souls on a day of dust ... As if he is a term running to a hope.'\n'He attains with gentleness what men are incapable of ... Like death, rushing, coming slowly.'\nIbn al-Rumi said praising Sa'id and mentioning the affair of the Alawi:\n'You besieged the leader of the Zanj until his powers ... Failed and his provision carrier perished.'\n'His sides were dense, but you ceased not ... Diminishing them with eradication as if you were a file.'\n'His soldiers disperse from him by stratagems ... And you increase them as soldiers while your army is firm.'\n'And the wearer of the peer's sword after stripping him ... Is more harmful to him than his breakers and more plotting.'\n'You settled a settling that was hostage to an assault ... Dark, thus the lion crouches to leap.'\nThis meaning is taken from the saying of Al-Nabigha al-Dhubyani:\n'Indeed I forbade Banu Dhubyan from Aqr ... And from their grazing in every Safar.'\n'And I said: O people, indeed the lion is contracted ... Upon his claws for the assault of the harmer.'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding Sa'id and the affair of a city:\n'She refused but to be besieged, so there became for her ... From fear of the calamity of siege, a siege.'\n'They humbled to your assault which is to them ... Like death coming having no shame.'\nSimilar to that is the saying of the poet:\n'For indeed the Commander of the Faithful and his deed ... Are like Time, there is no shame in what Time did.'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding the victory of Al-Afshin:\n'If he did not march to them, they would have marched to him ... Due to what is in their chests of fears.'\n'So as if his soul tricked against him ... If the trick of the trickster did not reach him.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding Sa'id:\n'You see him isolated from the fierce war ... While his traces in it, even if he is absent, are witnessed.'\n'Just as the decree and the judgment is His judgment ... Veiled from people entirely, there is no escape from Him.'\nAbu al-Hawl said regarding Yazid bin Mazyad taking Al-Walid bin Tarif:\n'Say to the caravans and the armies and others ... Travel, for Yazid has killed Al-Walid.'\n'Neither this one ceases seeking nor that one falls short ... Fleeing, so this is fatigue and that is exhausted.'\n'Like the night, the day seeks it with its light ... So the darkness of that is chased by the light of this.'\nSimilar to that is the saying of Al-Nabigha to Al-Nu'man:\n'For indeed you are like the night that overtakes me ... Even if I thought the distance from you is wide.'\nOne of the enamored with power said:\n'The evening we had the choice over them ... Whether to decrease from their lives or increase.'\nChapter 30 On the Description of the Stab\nConnected to this is the saying of Imru' al-Qays describing the stab (Hazaj Meter):\n'And I may snatch the stab ... My blade does not bleed for it.'\n'Like the pocket of the foolish, clumsy woman ... Startled while she is searching for lice.'",

    "text": "He mentioned that the sword is most cutting when blood precedes. As he said: My blade does not bleed for it.\nAnother said (Hazaj Meter):\n'And stabbing like the mouth of the wineskin ... While it and the wineskin are full.'\nAnother said:\n'And stabbing like the mouths of water skins, you see for it ... Streams (Anajir), the watering of which is not touched by a returning one.'\nAbu al-Najm said (Rajaz Meter):\n'We shall surely throw down a lion whose funeral wails ... With a wide stab in which is his pain.'\n'His blood boils from between his collarbones ... Like the dyer's cauldron boiled with its scum.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding Al-Muwaffaq when an arrow hit him:\n'He split the crowds with his sword ... And healed the pains of grudges.'\n'Bloody of wounds as if he is ... A rose opening on a branch.'\nAntara said:\n'And a husband of a beauty I left prostrate ... His shoulder muscle whistling like the corner of the harelip's mouth.'\n'My hands preceded for him with a hasty stab ... And the spray of a penetrating one like the color of dragon's blood.'\nHassan said:\n'Leave the gaps of Sham.' He said:\n'Intervening before it ... Is striking like the mouths of the grazing pregnant camels.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'Opening in the skulls of the people mouths ... Of camels grazing Arak and eating Asy.'\nQays bin al-Khatim said:\n'I stabbed Ibn Abd al-Qays the stab of a revenger ... It had a penetration, were it not for the rays, it would have illuminated it.'\n'I possessed my hand with it so I widened its rip ... A standing one sees from this side what is behind it.'\n'Al-Shu'a'': The scattering of blood and its redness. 'Malaktu al-ajina': i.e., I kneaded it strongly. Uthman, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Knead the dough strongly for it is one of the two increases. 'Anhartu': meaning I made flow, it is said 'Naharu al-anhar'.\nAnother said:\n'And the hybrid of Banu Sulaym escaped us ... The colt is ransomed out of love for return.'\n'Were it not for Allah and the ransomed colt ... You would have returned while you are a sieve of skin.'\nAnother said:\n'I struck him in the meeting a blow ... So the withers separated from his shoulder.'\n'So what was between them became a gap ... In which the lancer and archer walk.'\nAnother said:\n'I left Ibn Aws while the spearhead was as if ... A peg aimed with it between his eyes.'\nChapter 31 On the Description of Rain Clouds and Meadows\nFrom the excellent similes is the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz:\n'And a rain cloud, rain was generous from its eyelids ... While the garden is organized and the drops are scattered.'\n'You see its locations on the earth shining ... Like dirhams appearing then hiding.'\nThe meaning is from Antara describing a cloud:\n'Every flowing spring was generous upon it ... So they left every puddle like the dirham.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz also said:\n'And the tears of the pools did not become muddy ... As if they were dirhams in a spreading place.'\nAl-Buhturi said describing a cloud:\n'Possessing trembling with the moan of thunder ... Dragging the tail, truthful of promise.'\n'Shedding tears without passion ... It has a breeze like the breeze of the rose.'\n'And a ring like the roar of the lion ... And a flash of lightning like the swords of India.'\n'The East wind brought it from Najd ... So it scattered like the scattering of a necklace.'\n'So the earth became in a comfortable life ... From the embroidery of the flowers of hills in a cloak.'\n'As if its pools in the depression ... Play with its bubbles with dice.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said in a poem of his:\n'What do you see of the grace of the sky on the earth ... And the gratitude of gardens for rains?'\n'And as if spring unveils a bride ... And as if we are from its drops in a scattering (of coins/sweets).'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding a black cloud:\n'I saw nothing but the blackness of diligence ... Connecting early departure with night travel.'\n'She-camels, yet they are not she-camels ... Like the night, or like the Luba, or like the Nubians.'\n'Led by a pitch-black cloud ... Like the Shia gathered around a leader.'\n'Taking to the obedience of the South wind ... Undoing the ropes of calamities.'\n'Erasing the sticking drought ... The erasing of kissing the Corner for sins.'\n'When it appeared to the earth from near ... It longed for its pouring rain.'\n'The longing of the sick for the doctor ... And the joy of the lover with the beloved.'\n'And the happiness of the writer with the writer ... And the thunder stood in it like the preacher.'\n'And the wind moaned the moan of old camels ... So the earth in its new robe.'\n'Is like the middle-aged man after graying and bending ... Exchanged youth for gray hair.'\n'Delicious of saliva with the pouring ... As if it pours upon hearts.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a cloud:\n'And burdened with the weight of water, it came ... Swaying over the necks of winds.'\n'So it poured its night heavily and abundantly ... And drizzling like the mouths of wounds.'\nUbaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir said:",

A lover far away, so it does not cease weeping for him.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Weeping, laughing from lightnings ... Traveled with a pocket torn in the darkness.'\n'It inclined to the dry-saliva drought ... Like the inclination of a longing one to a beloved.'\n'And it encompassed the soil like the collar ... Until it became a beautiful sight.'\n'As if it imitates the weeping of the yearning one.'\nAl-Ta'i said similar:\n'As if the bright clouds hid beneath them ... A beloved, so tears do not stop for them.'\nAbu Awn al-Katib said:\n'The earth has come early to a morning drink ... It drinks it from the dew of the sky.'\n'A rain like the tear of the yearning one, pouring ... Heavily upon the acacia and the Sorrel.'\n'From a black cloud whose laughing is bright ... Like the mouth smiling from dark lips.'\nAl-Mubarrad recited to us (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'If Allah does not water except the noble ... Then may He water the dwellings of Banu Hanbal.'\n'A rain, stationary, having a fringe ... Truthful of thunders and noise.'\n'As if the clouds just below the sky ... Are ostriches hanging by the legs.'\nUbayd bin al-Abras said:\n'Low, approaching just above the earth, its fringe ... He who stands with the palm almost pushes it.'\n'So he who is in its high ground is like he who is in its courtyard ... And the sheltered is like he who walks in an open plain.'\nKuthayyir said similar:\n'And the sheltered and he who walks in its desert ... Are equal in it, and he who is in the plain and the mountain.'\nRegarding the covering of clouds, Imru' al-Qays says:\n'A continuous rain, pouring, having low clouds ... Covering the earth, seeking and flowing.'\nIbn Abi Awn al-Katib said regarding the covering of clouds and its nearness:\n'In a cloud that covered so it almost ... Shook hands with the soil with clouds.'\nSa'id bin Humayd said:\n'And you see the sky when its white clouds approach ... And as if it was clothed in the wing of a crow.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'As if the dark white clouds while the dawn is shining ... Are smoke of a fire whose embers do not light.'\nAnother said:\n'The South wind wove it, and she is skilled ... So it ascended as if it were an Abyssinian.'\n'And it collected (Qara) every gathering (Qariyah) it was collecting ... A collection, the gathered water (Qariyy) does not dry from it.'\n'Al-Qariyan': Water courses, which are 'Al-Madhanib', singular 'Midhnab'.\nAnother said regarding a cloud:\n'It came swaying, its peaks overlooking ... Dragging its first on its last.'\n'The walk of the bride shortening her steps ... As if there falls from its insides.'\n'Jumping locusts or their larvae.'\nTha'lab recited regarding a cloud:\n'The onlooker thinks it from behind the tent ... Scattering rising locusts or larvae.'\n'And the light donned a fitted shirt.'\nAnother said describing clouds when they empty their water:\n'As if when their skin became weak ... And water poured from every cloud.'\n'Is charcoal when its frying heated it.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a cloud:\n'It came with the eyelid of kohl and left ... Sore-eyed from the shedding of pouring tears.'\nAnother said describing the abundance of a torrent:\n'It overturns a great tree in it to the chins ... Your crushing with the razor the hair of monks.'\nSimilar is the saying of Abu Qardudah (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'It covers the thorny trees to their chins ... Like the covering of the stallion the slender young camels.'\nIbn Muqbil said describing the foam of a torrent:\n'You see every valley baffled in it as if ... A salty rider stayed upon it.'\nChapter 32 On the Tripod Stones (Athafi)\nFrom the beautiful similes in tripod stones is the saying of Abu Awn al-Katib:\n'There remained in it nothing but blacks, experienced ... Like the coal of fire, in it is ash, neglected.'\nAbu Nuwas said mocking Al-Qurashi:\n'I saw people's pots black from the roasting ... And the pot of the Raqashis is white like the full moon.'\n'He shows it to the seeker in their courtyard ... Three like the line of the Tha' (letter) from the dots of ink.'\nAdi bin Zaid said (Ramal Meter):\n'And three like pigeons in it ... Between their kneeling places is the tattooing of charcoal.'\nHe likened them to the pigeon because it has whiteness and blackness. Likewise is the saying of Jarir:\n'As if the traces of the house are feathers of a pigeon ... Decay erased them and they became silent to speak.'\nAbu Nuwas said regarding tripod stones:\n'Whose is a trace, bare of place, buried ... Its era effaced except eternal blacks.'\n'As pigeons were coupled at the roost ... Far of evening, they have no nests.'\nAl-Murrar al-Faq'asi said:\n'In every place are broad stones of a prostration place ... And standing ones in a fireplace, black.'\n'The trace of fuel on their sides ... With their cheeks, as if it is a slap.'\nAl-Ta'i said:",

Cheeks of virgins touched by pallor.'\nAl-Ta'i said, and Ibn Tahir claimed it is the best thing said regarding the trench (Nu'y):\n'And the trench, its half was erased so as if it is ... Under the accidents, an eyebrow joined (to the other).'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said similar:\n'Effaced and emptied except moles of dung ... And a trench of hidden line like the single eyebrow.'\nJamil bin Ma'mar said:\n'And traces of children and a trench as if it is ... A lip of a crescent, for the oldness standing.'\nChapter 33 On the Ruins (Talal)\nConnected to that is the saying of Labid, and it is of the best simile:\n'And the torrents revealed the ruins as if they are ... Books whose texts their pens renew.'\nHe informs that when the wind effaced the ruins and blew dust on them, and the rain came, it revealed the dust from them, so the traces appeared as faded scripts appear in books. 'Zubur': Books. Al-Muraqqish said, and he was named Al-Muraqqish by it:\n'The house is desolate and the traces are as ... A pen dotted (Raqqasha) on the back of the leather.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'Is it for the four dark ones which are as if they are ... Remnants of revelation in the backs of scrolls.'\nTarafa said:\n'For Khawlah there are ruins at the stony ground of Thahmad ... Shining like the remains of tattoo on the back of the hand.'\nZuhair said:\n'And a house of hers at the two Raqmas as if it is ... Renewed tattoos on the veins of a wrist.'\n'Al-Nawashir': Veins of the inner arm. 'Al-Washm': Decoration they used to use, and 'Al-Wasm' is its name, and they have names. 'Al-Rasm': Trace of a thing. Another said:\n'I knew the dwellings of the tribe empty, waste ... As if in them, when I imagined them, was a line.'\n'Renewed tattoos between a palm and a wrist ... Nights effaced it except that it has a trace.'\nQays bin al-Khatim said:\n'Do you know a trace like the gilded embroidery ... For Amrah, desolate except for the standing of a rider?'\n'Al-Madhahib': Leathers with gilded lines, steady, following each other, singular 'Madhhab'. 'Wahshan': i.e., desolate. From it, it is said to the one taking medicine 'Tawahhash': i.e., let nothing enter your stomach. 'Ghayra mawqifi rakibin': i.e., except that a rider passes and stops. Poetry in this chapter is very abundant. Abu Nuwas used to oppose the ways of the ancients and follow a path other than theirs in describing the decay of the trace and weeping over the ruins and asking for rain, as Al-Nimr bin Tawlab said:\n'So by Allah, I do not ask rain for the dwellings for their love ... But I give you water, O Harith bin Tawlab.'\nAl-Buhturi said mourning a boy:\n'May Allah water Al-Jazirah not for anything ... Except that that well be quenched.'\nAnother said:\n'May he water a grave containing Umm Amr ... At Nakhlah, what poured from the clouds.'\n'And I do not ask rain for the earth, but ... For bodies that stayed in it and heads.'\nAl-Ta'i said similar:\n'Their house hosted shedding tears from me ... Even if my morning returned after them dark.'\n'May He water their quarter, nay, may He water their distance ... From time, the udders of clouds full of milk.'\nAbu Nuwas said regarding what we mentioned (Munsarih Meter):\n'Watering for other than the height and the slope ... And other than the ruins of Mayya at Al-Jarad.'\n'O pouring of the clouds, if you have ... Watered the bend once, do not return.'\n'Do not water a town, if ... Towns are counted, it was an increase in grief.'\n'If I protect myself from the crow in it ... My escape from it would be to the shrike.'\n'Better to me than your falling with the ... Stone salting with it on a peg.'\n'Is the standing of a basil on an ear ... And the movement of a cup to a mouth by a hand.'\nHe also said:\n'Whose is a ruin increasing in beauty of traces ... With the length of its desolation and goodness of breeze?'\n'Decay turned away from them until as if ... They wore from desolation a garment of bliss.'\nAl-Buhturi said on the method of the ancients:\n'I see among the wrapped Arak trees dwellings ... Standing, if only their oryxes were standing.'\n'We met the dwellings at the bend, so as if we ... Met the beautiful women wearing no jewelry.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'If you wish not to see patience for a patient ... Then look at what state the ruin has become.'\n'As if its singing place was generous so changed it ... Our tears the day they separated while they were pouring.'\nIbn al-Raqqi said similar:\n'Longing turned him while man sobers and gets drunk ... Traces like the rags of scrolls, obliterated.'\n'I held my companions at them, so its courtyards remained ... By my tears and breaths, joyful and rained upon.'\nMu'alla al-Ta'i said:\n'They wore decay until as if their traces ... Tasted passion or tasted the abandonment of lovers.'\nMuhammad bin Wuhayb said:",

    "text": "'They wore decay so as if they found ... After the loved ones the like of what I find.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'O East Wind of the afternoons, indeed the sandy ground of Thahmad ... Complains of your variation in eternal blowing.'\n'Dung-heaps standing like stars, so if they are effaced ... Then by which star in passion do we guide ourselves?'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'O ruins of Mayya, inform us at Manbij ... Is your singing forbidden to the exhausted sick one?'\n'And among the deeds of ignorance is stopping a possessor of mind ... At courtyards like the confused book.'\nHe also said:\n'Did you not see the dwellings of the daughter of Malik ... Her traces drew for him how sighing is?'\n'And as if decay threw its staff in them ... Out of an intention of throwing, so it does not leave them.'\nAl-Kumayt said:\n'And a cracked (peg) the maids left its head ... Like the Siwak, and a piece of rope like the parchment.'\nRegarding it Ibn Na'imah al-Madani says:\n'And a castaway of humiliation cracked by the stone ... Upon its head is fine dust.'\nAl-Mutalammis said regarding it:\n'And none stays on humiliation he is subjected to ... Except the two humilitated ones: the donkey of the family and the peg.'\n'This one is tied with his rope on humiliation ... And that one is cracked and no one pities him.'\nAbu Nuwas mentioned it and said (Hazaj Meter):\n'And a beaten one without sin ... And there is no sin in beating him.'\n'And his beater does not blame him ... As long as the aged camels yearn.'\n'And he does not say why ... Nor why am I beaten.'\n'And a verse (house) too narrow for a shoelace ... And in it are the Khazars and Nubians.'\nMeaning the verse of poetry. Another said regarding the erasure of dwellings:\n'At the branch of the bend, and the quarter, its people have lightened ... And exchanged winds, South and North.'\n'Co-wives settled in the courtyards as if ... They circled a sieve over what the tribe left.'\nSimilar is the saying of Urwa bin Udhaynah:\n'And they sifted it the sifting of flour, staying ... Every wind lends it its sieve.'\nChapter 34 On Wine\nFrom the beautiful similes in wine is the saying of Al-Ukkuk, who is Ali bin Jabalah:\n'And a pure one, having softness in the cup ... And not having obstinacy in souls.'\n'As if the hand of the boon companion circulates of it ... A ray which a cup does not surround.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Aged, the mixture forged for its head ... Crowns of pearls whose strung ones have no thread.'\n'It was hidden until as if its light ... Is the certainty of a conscience which doubt almost enters.'\nAbu Awn al-Katib said:\n'And give it to me, may you be given drink, O Ibn Amr ... Of a bay (wine), shining like the ray.'\n'Daughter of ten (years) like the thought of imagination or ... The snatching of lightning or like the sense of hearing.'\nIbn Abi Karima said:\n'As if it is an accident in the palm of its drinker ... You think it empty while the cup is full.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'So drink upon the flowers of gardens mixed with ... The flowers of cheeks and the flower of wine.'\n'From a coffee that makes one forget worries and sends ... Longing that has strayed in the vitals.'\n'Its color hides the glass so as if it is ... Standing in the cup without a vessel.'\nIbn al-Rumi said in this meaning:\n'And an orphan of her vine and her dew ... The sun left nothing of her but her core.'\n'She became subtle so she almost became diffused ... In the air like its ray and its breeze.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And Karkhi in lineage or Babylonian ... She stayed eras in the darkness of the cave not traveling.'\n'She poured the purity of water over her purity ... So I solved them as a basket from the sun and the moon.'\nAnother said:\n'Water of vines and water of the Nile in a cup ... And water is two waters in what resembles water.'\n'A cup that cleared, and its glass cleared from it ... As if it, for the resemblance of color, is hollow.'\nIbn Abi Umayyah said:\n'Give me drink in Surra Man Ra'a to the monastery ... Then the top of the valley to its bends.'\n'From a drink as if it is not in the cup ... When you poured it, due to its purity.'\nAnother said regarding its thinness and purity:\n'And a cup the merchants captured from the land of Babylon ... Like the thinness of the water of longing in the wide eyes.'\n'If the cupbearer mixed it, you thought its bubbles ... Eyes of locusts from under the wings of ants.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'And there is nothing for amusement but every pure one ... As if she is a tear in the eye of an abandoned one.'\nAnother said (Munsarih Meter):\n'And coffee like tears, pure ... From the eye of a lover whom sadness melted.'\nAbd al-Samad bin al-Mu'adhdhal said:\n'And he disputed with me a cup as if its saliva ... Is my tears when sleep was blocked from my eye.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'So give us from your clear sweet drink ... And do not prohibit us, may the sky water you.'",

If he tasted it, he who tasted it smacks his lips.'\nAl-Nazzam was asked about glass, he said: It does not hide the speck, nor covers the face of the boon companion, and its fault is that breaking comes quickly to it and it does not accept mending.\nFrom the beautiful simile it was likened to is the saying of Abu Nuwas (Munsarih Meter):\n'Then I poked its head with the blade of the awl ... So it came as if it were a flame.'\n'I say when they resembled each other in likeness ... Which of them is gold for the resemblance?'\n'They are equal and the difference between them ... Is that they are solid and poured.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'O my two boon companions, give me drink for there appeared ... A morning and the Christian bell called.'\n'From a bay (wine) as if it is a land of gold dust ... In its sides are planted pearls.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'Aged in the jar until ... It is in the thinness of my religion.'\n'Then mixed so turned ... Around it like eyes.'\n'Pupils gazing at us ... Not stony with eyelids.'\n'Gold bearing fruit of pearls ... Every time and moment.'\nHe also has (Munsarih Meter):\n'And old wine I went early to its tavern ... So they cut its jugular vein with a strainer.'\n'So sweat flowed on its upper chest ... As if its course is the twist of an anklet.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said (Munsarih Meter):\n'Coming out of its jar while humped ... Like a crescent appearing with curvature.'\n'Whoever blames me regarding wine is like one who ... Writes with water on papers.'\nAws bin Hajar said:\n'I will write in the pure water to you ... Upon your distance if there is a writer for water.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'So when you unveiled it, it is dust ... Denying the palm what it permits the eyes.'\n'Then mixed so laughed revealing pearls ... If gathered in a hand we would have acquired them.'\n'In cups as if they are stars ... Running, their constellations are our hands.'\n'Rising with the cupbearers upon us ... So when they set, they set in us.'\n'If you saw the drinkers around it from afar ... You would say a people warming themselves from cold.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'A gazelle free of sorrows deposited in me ... What Allah knows of sorrow and anxiety.'\n'As if he and as if the cup in his hand ... Is the crescent of the first of the month gulping in twilight.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'And a slender one whose beauties were complete ... Until he exceeded the wish of the soul.'\n'The cups yearn for his sipping places ... And smile in his hand from imprisonment.'\n'And as if he and the cup in his hand ... Is a moon kissing the side of the sun.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'If the drinker of the people gulped in it, you thought him ... Kissing in a dark night a star.'\nHe also has:\n'And as if its drinker, due to excess of its ray ... At night, is sipping in the light of a torch.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'O beauty of Ahmad going early yesterday ... With a yellow wine like Wars.'\n'And as if his palms divide in ... Our cups pieces of the sun.'\nIbn al-Rumi said (Munsarih Meter):\n'And we are given drink the drink of a possessor of manners ... His praise is from the fruits of kindness.'\n'It meets you in the thinness of drink and in ... The scent of lavender and yellowness of twilight.'\n'It has a pure part as if it is gold ... And foam like restless pearls.'\nLikening bubbles to halves of pearls is better than likening it to whole pearls. Ibn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Give drink the veiled one of the jars ... The first juice of wine, strong.'\n'A wine as if its bubbles ... Are pearls rolling, hollow.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'As if the small and large of its bubbles ... Is gravel of pearls on a land of gold.'\nHe has:\n'Then mixed so turned ... Above it a collar so it circled.'\n'Like the coupling of pearls with pearls ... Small and large.'\n'So if the eye intercepts it ... From where it circled.'\n'You thought it in the sides of the ... Cup small Waws.'\nAnother said:\n'So he came with it like the sun, its bubbles mimic ... The stars of Pleiades in the glass for us in beauty.'\nAbu Nuwas said (Munsarih Meter):\n'It plays the play of the mirage in the cup of the ... People when its bubbles connect.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a cup eyes are veiled from ... So there is no way for a looker into it.'\n'As if a white cloud between me ... And the wind, lightnings pierce it.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'Pure, if you extracted its power ... It led to your intellect joy.'\n'And as if in it from its grasshoppers ... Is a horse, if you calmed him he bolted.'\nAnd he took from the saying of Hassan in his poem:",

In the scent of camphor and color of perfume.'\n'So as if it, while its sparks are flying ... And water extinguishes it, is the flame of a fire.'\nIbn Abi Awn al-Katib said:\n'And for the sun in the guarantee of ages is a deposit ... Taking the place of the sun if the sun sets.'\n'The depositors verify it so it appeared ... So nothing remained of it but the sense or the insertion.'\n'And it has no limit that languages encompass its description ...

A precious one of a boudoir whom touch confused.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'Then when they mixed it ... It leaped the leap of locusts.'\n'Then when they drank it ... It took the taking of sleep.'\nSimilar is his saying:\n'And it has a creeping in the bones as if it is ... The grip of drowsiness and its taking of the joint.'\n'Their palms were fragrant with it so as if ... They snatch with it a necklace of clove.'\nSimilar to it for him:\n'So it sent from the mouth of the pitcher a pure one ... Like the tongue, it ran and the body held back.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'And a cup like the honeyed wishes I drank ... But it glorified and drank my mind.'\n'If blamed with water, its excuse was ... A flame like the falling of fire in thick wood.'\n'If the hand attained it with a wrong, it became dignified ... Upon its grudge then took revenge on the man.'\nDik al-Jinn said:\n'And rise you, so urge our cup not humiliated ... And do not give cooked drink, and give its wine.'\n'So he rose, the cup almost dyes his palm ... And you think he borrowed it from his cheeks.'\n'Rose-colored in the hand of a gazelle as if he ... Took it from his cheek and circulated it.'\n'So we remained shaking its spirit with our hands ... And the wine takes its revenge from our feet.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz took his saying: 'As if he ... Took it from his cheek and circulated it', and added to it, saying:\n'The cup circulates upon us from the hand of a fawn ... Who has a glance of an eye complaining of sickness, exhausted.'\n'As if the first juice of wine is from the water of his cheek ... And its bunch is picked from his curly hair.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'And a coffee whose star shines ... Musk and ambergris diffuse from it.'\n'Rosy, a fawn urges it ... As if it is squeezed from his cheek.'\n'Slender, he has not smiled laughing ... Since he was, except the jewel scattered.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a fire we ignited quickly at dawn ... Whenever water is spilled on it, it ignites.'\n'The bubbles of water roam in its sides ... As a tear roamed on a rosy cheek.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'So when the water topped it, it clothed it ... With freckles resembling the bells of the partridge.'\n'Until when its sides settled ... It wrote with the like of the legs of ants.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'As if in its cup while the water knocks it ... Are legs of ants or the engraving of rings.'\nHe said (Munsarih Meter):\n'Water has in it a wondrous writing ... Like an engraving in the stone of a ruby.'\nMuslim said:\n'If the cupbearer touched it, it lent his fingertips ... Robes like saffron, yellow of its color.'\n'A dust-colored hollow one kneeled upon it ... So she became a heart for him and he became a chest for her.'\n'She refused that the jar attain the touch of her skin ... So the foaming wove for her a curtain without her.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'Lo, perhaps a cup whose first juice was given to me by ... A slender-bending, clear-mouthed, lustrous-toothed one.'\n'If his fingertips took from its languor ... You saw the silver going with the wine.'\n'As if in his eyes, the one who came carrying ... With his palms from its vessel when he frowns.'\nHe has:\n'She shook hands in our farewell so she showed us ... Gold from her dye in silver.'\nAbu al-Shis said:\n'A gazelle gave me drink of it while the night had grayed its head ... Dyed with the henna of the glass.'\nHe also has (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'A fawn circulates upon us with it ... His hands are dyed from the cup.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'A north wind (wine), if mixed you say a cornelian ... Bargaining competed in it among merchants.'\n'As if the remains of what was effaced of its bubbles ... Are scattered gray hairs in the blackness of a sideburn.'\n'A hand gives it to you as if its fingertips ... When the eye intercepts them are a row of orbital stars.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said (Munsarih Meter):\n'So drink a wine as if it is a firebrand ... Time has cast its gold dust so it cleared.'",

Kisra is his father and his mother is Bilqis.'\n'He strives with a pitcher as if its strainer ... From its light is dipped in safflower.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And beloved of manners, military ... He has killing but he has no weapon.'\n'As if the cup in his hand is a bride ... She has a sash of wet pearls.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'You see its cup at mixing as if you ... Scattered upon it the jewelry of a bride's head.'\n'So it tears the curtains of conscience from the vitals ... And reveals from secrets every imprisonment.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'Abu al-Ghawth gave me drink and did not limit ... At the two camps a drink of stealth.'\n'Of a wine you imagine it while it is a star ... In the darkness of night or the saliva of a sun.'\n'It was emptied into the vessel from every heart ... So it is beloved to every soul.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'Alert your boon companion, he has breathed ... He gives you a cup in the darkness.'\n'Pure, as if its ray ... From the hand of its drinker is a firebrand.'\n'It leaves the youth as if ... In his tongue from it is dumbness.'\n'He is called so he raises his head ... So when he rises with it, he lowers it.'\nSimilar is the saying of Abu al-Hindi:\n'I gave Abu al-Mutarrah drink when he came to me ... While the possessor of earrings was erect, shouting.'\n'A drink flies flee from ... And the eloquent one lisps when he drinks it.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'It came to you from the house of a vintner with its clay ... Yellow like the ray of the sun, glowing.'\n'So he snatched it from the mouth of the pitcher so it gushed ... Like the tongue, it ran and the body held back.'\nAl-Akhtal said:\n'I disputed with them the goodness of the North wind wine while ... The rooster had crowed and the time of the night traveler's fall came.'\n'When they brought it with a lamp and their strainer ... It rose to them the rising of the trained vein (Abjal).' \nFrom good metaphor is the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz (Munsarih Meter):\n'Stand, give it to me, the first juice of what is pressed ... Polished in the covers of jewel.'\n'She inhabited the jar in a safflower-dyed one ... And was brought out in a yellow straw-covered one.'\nAl-Najim said:\n'She was squeezed so she cast a jet-black suit ... Off her and dragged tails for the cornelian.'\nIbn al-Rumi said (Munsarih Meter):\n'And pearl of color in the cheeks of the boon companions ... While she is yellow in the cheeks of the cups.'\nAnd for Ibn al-Rumi:\n'She is Wars in the eggs of cups, but if she appeared ... To your eyes in the eggs of faces, then dragon's blood.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'You become by the face of wine and the bird of happiness ... A bay (Kumayt), and after mixing in the likeness of the rose.'\nAl-Najim said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Circulate, O Salamah, the cup of wine ... And resemble with your singing the cooing of the turtledove.'\n'And take it diluted, a coffee ... Pouring upon the night the garment of the day.'\n'The cheek robs it of its redness (Jiryal) ... And gifts it to the eye on the day of hangover.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a slain one of intoxication lived for me if I called him ... To me responding, he might see his error as rectitude.'\n'So he stood with remains of his hangover in his palms ... And his eyes from his cheeks had gathered roses.'\nAl-Asha said:\n'And a noble one of what Babylon ages ... Like the blood of the slaughtered, I robbed it of its redness.'\nThe narrators interpret this verse saying: I drank it red and urinated it white. Abu Nuwas was asked about it, he said: The meaning in it is like his saying:\n'A cup, if it descends into the throat of its drinker ... Showed you its redness in the eye and the cheek.'\nChapter 35 On Wine Vessels\nFrom the similes in wine vessels is the saying of Alqama bin Abdah:\n'As if their pitcher is a gazelle on a height ... Covered (Mufaddam) with the Saba of linen, veiled.'\n'Al-Fidam' and 'Al-Litham' are one, which is what you tied on the mouth of the pitcher or the mouth of a human. From that it is said a man is 'Fadm' as if there is a cover on his mouth. And 'Malthum' with a veil. Their pitchers in old times had legs, so they likened them to gazelles for the length of their necks and legs.\nAnother said:\n'O Lord of a gathering of youths I drank with ... From Abd Shams in the peaks of the heights.'\n'And as if their pitcher from its beauty ... Is a gazelle on a height in front of gazelles.'\nAbu al-Hindi said regarding vessels:\n'Covered with silk as if their necks ... Are necks of water daughters (birds) terrified by thunder.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And as if the pitcher of wine among them ... Is a gazelle on a height, overlooking, mad with love.'\n'When the cupbearers urged him, he knelt to them ... So he wept over the cup of the boon companion and laughed.'\nIshaq al-Mawsili said:\n'As if the pitchers of wine among them ... Are gazelles at the top of the two Raqmas, standing.'",

    "text": "'And they drank until as if their necks ... From softness, no bones were created for them.'\nAbu Nuwas said similar to that:\n'Riders gave each other drink on the saddles among them ... The cup of slumber, and the giver and receiver became intoxicated.'\n'As if their heads ... While sleep places them on the shoulders, were not straightened by necks.'\nIncluded in this chapter of good simile is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi describing a cup he gifted to Ali bin Yahya in verses some connected to others:\n'And a wonder of wonders captivating ... Every mind and pleasing every eye.'\n'It became fine in beauty and saltiness until ... No describer fulfills its right of description.'\n'Like air without dust mixed ... With light, how thin that is and how pure.'\n'Middle of size, not too big for a gulp ... Continuous, nor too small for a sip.'\n'Not hasty upon minds, ignorant ... But forbearing from them without weakness.'\n'The onlookers did not see in figure and form ... A horseman like it on the back of a palm.'\n'In it is a scorpion color bent by ... The wise smiths the best bending.'\n'Like the bending of sideburns on cheeks ... Of a gazelle proud of a mouth and a glance.'\nHe said regarding a cup in which he saw black wine:\n'Ahmad gave me a second drink of Dushab (syrup) ... A drink that disturbed the blackness of youth.'\n'You do not see me while the cup of Dushab is in my hand ... But you saw a falcon and a crow.'\nAl-Buhturi said similar to that (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'So a wine came, sour to him ... Hard on the desolate liver.'\n'If its blackness is poured in the vessel ... Then the cup of the boon companion is an inkwell with it.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'My brother, turn the cup of wine away from me, for no wine ... You exchanged for it black, pitch-dark, bitter.'\n'As if in the hands of its drinkers when they got intoxicated ... Are inkwells of paper-makers filled with ink.'\nFrom the beautiful simile is the saying of Al-Buhturi regarding a thinner vessel:\n'That gift came to us and the wine ... Is of the best you volunteered to gift.'\n'It wore the blueness of glass so it came ... Gold appearing in lapis lazuli.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'He went early with it yellow, Karkhi ... As if it burns in its cup.'\n'So you think the water glass flowing ... And you think the cups water frozen.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'And as if its joy and the joy of its cup ... Are fire and light restricted in a vessel.'\n'Or a white virgin pearl covered ... A mountain upon a red ruby.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Who is for me despite the envier with a coffee ... Virgin, foster daughter of a tavern, virgin.'\n'A wave of melted gold enclosed by ... A cup like the shell of the white pearl.'\nThis is the saying of Abu Nuwas:\n'So the wine is a ruby and the cup a pearl ... From the hand of a maid slender of figure.'\nChapter 36 On Narcissus\nFrom the good said regarding narcissus is what Al-Mubarrad recited to us:\n'A narcissus, its glance noticed me ... Resembling a dinar on a dirham.'\nUbaydullah bin Abdullah said regarding it (Munsarih Meter):\n'It gazes with its eyes at you as ... The gazelles gaze when they fear.'\n'Like rubies strung upon ... Emerald, above them is camphor.'\n'As if they, while eyes watch them ... Are dirhams in the middle of which are dinars.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'I have narcissus, fresh of picking, as if it ... When we grant it eyes, is eyes.'\n'Different in their form, for yellowness ... Is in place of blackness, and the whiteness is eyelids.'\nHe said, mentioning the cause that it is like an eye that does not blink, so the simile became complete:\n'As if the narcissus mimics for us ... The eye of a lover always looking.'\n'It does not blink ever out of its pity ... Fearing a look that falls short.'\nAnother said:\n'And as if the eyes in the fresh narcissus ... Are eyes entrusted with sleeplessness.'\nIbn al-Rumi said preferring narcissus over rose:\n'The cheeks of the rose blushed from preferring it ... Blushing, its ruddiness is a witness against it.'\n'The rose, ruddy of color, did not blush ... Except that a stubborn opponent attributed virtue to it.'\n'To the narcissus belongs the clear virtue, even if ...

With the rain of clouds as the parent raises.'\n'So look at the two brothers, whoever of them is closer ... In resemblance to his parent, then that is the noble one.'\n'Where are cheeks compared to eyes in preciousness ... and leadership, were it not for corrupt analogy?'\nAl-Nashi said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'The most specific qualities which ... It attained from close.'\n'Eyes without faces ... Having pupils of gold.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'As if the eyes of the fresh narcissus between us ... Are oil containers of pearls, between them is cornelian.'\n'If the rain wet them, you thought their tears ... The weeping of eyes whose kohl is perfume (Khaluq).'\nIbn al-Rumi said asking for wine:\n'Catch your trusted ones, for they have fallen ... Into narcissus with whom is the daughter of the grape.'\n'For they are in a state, if you saw it ... You would glorify (God) out of wonder and joy.'\n'Their basil is gold on pearls ... And their drink is pearls on gold.'\n'O narcissus of the world, stay forever ... For suggestion and the circling of toasts.'\n'Refined eyes, if they represented them ... Pearls of eyelids, peridot of stalks.'\nZubayr bin Bakkar recited to us:\n'Suns and moons of flowers rising ... For the possessor of amusement in its sides, enjoyable.'\n'Intoxicated, the winds bend them so they bend ... And some kiss some then return.'\n'As if upon them from the flow of their dew ... Are pearls, except that they are brighter.'\n'And the East wind rolls them down from it so as if they are ... Tears shed by separation, and separation hurts.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said in a poem of his describing all flowers:\n'Do you not see the garden how it blossomed ... And spread the unrolled yellow cloak?'\n'And the rose laughed at the anemones ... And embraced the branch, the embrace of a lover.'\n'In a meadow like the suits of the bride ... And Khurram like the head of the peacock.'\n'And jasmine in the peaks of branches ... Organized like pieces of pure gold.'\n'And the cypress like rods of peridot ... Has drawn water from moist soil.'\n'Upon meadows and rich soil ... And a stream like the polished file.'\n'And the poppy hatched at a time and opened ... As if it is Korans with white pages.'\n'Or like cups of crystal ... You imagine them embodied of light.'\n'You see it after the spreading of the rose ... Like maces in the hands of the soldiers.'\n'And the Azad lily, spread of robes ... Like cotton touched by some moisture.'\n'And the fruits of coriander appeared in it ... As if they are skulls of ambergris.'\n'And the ring of ox-eye (Bahir) around the myrtle ... A skull like the head of the deacon.'\n'And pomegranate blossom like the redness of the rose ... Or like the combs of the roosters of India.'\n'And chamomile like bright front teeth ... Their flowers were separated by the rain.'\nFrom the good simile in it regarding blaming winter:\n'And I forgot the sparks of the stove ... As if it is scattering of jasmine.'\n'And it left the carpet after extinguishing ... Having black dots like the skin of the leopard.'\nLikening ox-eye to the deacon's head is taken from the saying of Ibn al-Rumi describing a meadow:\n'And a virgin meadow not spinster ... Every thundering sky was generous to it.'\n'As if tongues are licking from it ... In it are suns of ox-eye, yellow.'\n'As if they are skulls of deacons ... Its flower pleases you, bowing.'\n'With a wakeful eye and a sleepy neck ... The pearl of dew is a horseman upon it.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'O how often I disputed with it ... The spirit of pure jars.'\n'In a meadow as if it is ... The skin of a naked sky.'\nAl-Ukhaytil al-Wasiti said:\n'Watering for a land, if I sleep, it wakes me ... After calm in it, the knocking of bells.'\n'As if its lily in every overlooking one ... Upon the fields are tails of peacocks.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'I stayed in a distraction, best day and playground ... The cup circulates upon us among radiant youths.'\n'I have fresh narcissus and cypress as if it is ... Figures of maids leaning in green waist-wrappers.'\nSa'id bin Humayd said mentioning a meadow:\n'Surrounded by cypress like songstresses wearing ... Green silk on a moderate stature.'\n'So as if they, while the wind struts between them ... Intend embracing then shyness prevents them.'\nHe has:\n'And you see the branches when winds breathe ... Wrapped like the embracing of loved ones.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'And meadows the earth struts in them ... The strutting of the girl in burdas.'",

With a sight in which is clearing for the vision.'\n'Oh for it as a favor, it has thanked ... It praised Allah for the blessings, the rain.'\n'For the earth is in a meadow like the stripes of the Hibarah ... Adorned itself after modesty and shyness.'\n'The adornment of the female addressing the male.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding a meadow:\n'The face of the soil revealed to us a sight ... Like the bound cloth or like embroidery or like jewels.'\n'Of white and yellow and red ... And a new one whose eyelids did not look.'\n'The eye thinks it a mouth that did not open ... And opening, it almost did but did not blossom.'\n'As if it is smiling, not showing teeth ... And the tears of pools did not become muddy.'\n'As if they are dirhams in a spreading place ... Or like the tens of the spread Koran.'\n'In it the dew is stopped, not dripping ... Like a confused tear in an eye socket.'\nAbd al-Samad bin al-Mu'adhdhal said, and some attribute these verses to Khalid al-Katib:\n'My eye saw from him two sights as it saw ... Of the sun and the illuminating moon on the earth.'\n'The evening he greeted me with a rose as if it were ... Cheeks added some to some.'\n'And he disputed with me a cup as if its saliva ... Is my tears when sleep was blocked from my eye.'\n'And he turned away, and the action of intoxication in his movements ... From the wine is the action of wind on the tender branch.'\nAli bin al-Jahm said:\n'The rose did not miss a thing of you ... Goodness and beauty and no boredom.'\n'It stayed until when we became intimate ... With its proximity, it hastened to move.'\nChapter 37 On Waters and Streams\nFrom the beautiful simile in waters, streams, and pools is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\n'More delicious than the aged of Al-Rasatun ... And my coffee of Qutrabbul and Karin.'\n'A gurgling from water of a night of Tishrin ... Like the luster of the sharpened Yemeni sword.'\nDhu al-Rumma said in similar:\n'And the light of morning did not split until appeared ... Streams like cutting swords.'\nAnother said regarding water of strong flow:\n'As if he who witnesses it loses it ... So it is a cure for the thirsty from what pains him.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'No dwelling is like the dwelling of Al-Duwayrah ... O house, may a downpour be generous to you and water you.'\n'And as if a coat of mail poured from silver ... Is the water of the pool, your East wind ran upon it.'\nAnother said:\n'Oh would that I knew, will I see the side of Al-Hima ... While its stream bed has grown its herbs, curly?'\n'And will I ever come to water of a hollow ... As if the East wind tied a cloak on its surface?'\nMuslim, Victim of the Songstresses, said:\n'And water like the eye of the sun, not accepting speck ... If the East wind crept in it, you thought it rising.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And water like the horizon of morning, pure its main part ... I pushed the sandgrouse from it and lightened a chest.'\n'If the wind deemed it ignorant, its speck roamed ... And stripped from its sheaths so it flowed.'\n'So when they arrived at the water and its purity slipped out ... As the hands of polishers sheathed a blade.'\nHe also has:\n'I remained at it given the first juice of coffee to drink ... By the hand of a gazelle with hunting eyelids.'\n'On a stream, quenched, not concealing the speck ... As if its channels are the surfaces of files.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'On the sides of a filled stream ... White like the spread parchment.'\n'Or like the surface of the famous blade ... Gliding like the terrified snake.'\nAl-Ta'i recited:\n'Read peace to the trickling water and say to it ... All drinking places since you were abandoned are blameworthy.'\n'Watering for your shade in the evening and forenoon ... And for the coldness of your water, while waters are hot.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said mocking a water:\n'And water, effaced of traces, empty ... Like a brain confused in a kohled eyelid.'\nAnother said:\n'Is there to a drink in the sides of Munshid ... A way? For the water of Al-Lawahiq has worn you out.'\n'It has clamors in the bellies as if they are ... If heard, the running of noble winning horses.'\n'As if crushed musk was mixed with its taste ... If a taster tasted it one day on the board.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'And water far of time from people, altered ... As if locusts spit the water of the vast space into it.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And empty water I knocked on in darkness ... The sandgrouse upon it, as if its altered water is oil.'\nAbu al-Abbas Ahmad bin Yahya Tha'lab recited to us:\n'And green like henna, overflowing its main part ... Distant are voices in it, cut off in the barren land.'\n'I found the wolf howling at it as if he ... Is a dissolute one empty of all wealth and family.'\n'So I said to him: O wolf, do you have use for a youth ... Who consoles you in the back of the mount and the saddle?'\nChapter 38 On the Description of Fire\nKuthayyir said mentioning a fire:\n'I saw, and my companions were at Ayla at midnight ... While the descending Farqad star had set.'\n'A fire for Azza that does not die down, as if it ... When we glanced at it from the distance is a star.'\nAnother said in description of a fire:\n'As if the fire cuts from its light ... Gores of a jubbah of purple.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And kindlers who spent the night feeding the flame ... Satiating it with charcoal and wood.'\n'Raising fires like trees of gold.'\nAnother said:\n'And a barker seeking fire after the calm, I invited him ... With a red one like the dawn, glowing is its fuel.'\nJarran al-Awd said:\n'And a fire like the magic of the oud, its light is raised ... With the morning by the gusts of shaking winds.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Over a fire satiated with thick wood ... When it blazed, it threw sparks.'\n'So it tops the hill like the red ... Banner, piercing the darkness to every night traveler.'\nAnother said regarding the conquest of Heraclea:\n'As if our fires at the side of their fortress ... Are dyed cloths on short ropes.'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding Al-Mu'tasim burning Al-Afshin:\n'The secret of disbelief did not cease between his ribs ... Until he warmed at the secret of the fire-stick emitting sparks.'\n'A fire, a flame assaults his body from its heat ... As you dyed the slit of a waist-wrapper with safflower.'\n'Flames flew for it, its scorching destroys ... His pillars, a destruction without dust.'\n'Kindled, raised for the greatest polytheist ... What its light used not to be raised for the night traveler.'\n'He prayed to it alive, and was its fuel ... Dead, and enters it with the wicked.'\nChapter 39 On the Length of the Night\nFrom the beautiful simile in the length of the night is the saying of Imru' al-Qays:\n'And a night like the wave of the sea lowered its curtains ... Upon me with types of worries to test.'\n'So I said to it when it stretched its spine ... And followed with buttocks and rose with a chest.'\n'Lo, O night, clear yourself ... With a morning, and the morning is not better than you.'\n'Oh for you of a night, as if its stars ... By every twisted rope were tied to Yadhbul.'",

    "text": "...And as if a coat of mail cast from silver... is the water of the pool when the breeze blows over it. Another said: I wonder, will I see the side of the sanctuary... when its waterways have grown curly herbs? And will I ever sip the water of a hollow... as if the breeze has fastened a coat of mail upon its surface? Muslim (Sari' al-Ghawani) said: And water like the eye of the sun that accepts no speck... when the breeze steps into it, you imagine it rising. Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: And water like the horizon of the morning, its fullness is pure... I pushed the sandgrouse from it and lightened a burden; When the wind bullies it, its motes swirl... and it is unsheathed from its scabbards and flows like a chain/sequins; When they arrived at the water and its purity was drawn out... just as the hands of polishers sheath a blade. He also has: I remained there being served the purest wine... by the hand of a gazelle possessing hunting eyelids; By a lush stream that conceals no speck... as if its channels are the surfaces of files. Ibn al-Rumi said: On the edges of a filled stream... white like an unrolled scroll; Or like the blade of a famous sword... slithering like a frightened snake. Al-Tai recited: Convey peace to the trickling water and say to it... 'All drinking places, since I left you, are blameworthy; May there be rain for your shade in the evening and morning... and for the coolness of your water, for [other] waters are boiling heat.' Ibn al-Mu'tazz said mocking water: And water with effaced traces, empty... like hot tear-fluid in an eye adorned with kohl. Another said: Is there a way to a drink at the sides of Munshid... for the water of the followers has tested you; It has clamor in the bellies, as if it is... when heard, the running of noble racing horses; As if crushed musk were mixed with its taste... when a taster tastes it one day upon a board. Dhu al-Rummah said: And water whose time with people is distant, stagnant... as if the locusts of the open desert spit into it. Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: And empty water that I came to at dusk... upon it were sandgrouse, as if its stagnant content were oil. Abu al-Abbas Ahmad bin Yahya Tha'lab recited to us: And green [water] like henna, its fullness overflowing... sounds are distant within it, cut off by the drought; I found a wolf howling at it as if he were... an outcast, empty of all wealth and family; So I said to him, 'O Wolf, would you like a young man... who will share with you the back of the mount and the saddle?' Chapter 38: On the Description of Fire. Kuthayyir said, mentioning a fire: I saw, while my companions were at Ayla at midnight... and the star of the Farqad had set; A fire for Azzah that does not die down, as if it were... when we glanced at it from afar, a planet. Another said in the description of fire: As if the fire cuts from its brilliance... the gores of a jubbah made of purple. Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: And kindled fires that spent the night igniting the flame... feeding it full with charcoal and wood; Raising fires like trees of gold. Another said: And one barking [seeking hospitality] after the calm, I invited him... with a blond [fire] like the dawn, its fuel glowing. Jarran al-Oud said: And a fire like the dawn of the wood, its light raised... with the morning by the gusts of violent winds. Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: Over a fire satiated with thick wood... when it blazed, it threw sparks; So it tops the hill like a red banner... ripping the darkness for every night traveler. Another said regarding the conquest of Heraclea: As if our fires beside their citadel were... dyed cloths upon the ropes of bleachers. Al-Tai said regarding Al-Mu'tasim's burning of Afshin: The secret of disbelief remained between his ribs... until he burned in the secret of the glowing fire-stick; A fire whose heat assaults his body... a flame as if you had dyed the slit of a garment with safflower; Sparks flew from it, its scorching heat demolishing... his pillars, a demolition without dust; Kindled, it was raised for the greatest polytheist... its light was not raised for the night traveler; He prayed to it while alive, and was its fuel... when dead, and he enters it with the wicked. Chapter 39: On the Length of the Night. Among the beautiful similes regarding the length of the night is the saying of Imru' al-Qays: And a night like the waves of the sea lowered its curtains... upon me with all sorts of worries to test me; So I said to it when it stretched its spine... and followed with its buttocks and rose with its chest; 'O long night, will you not clear... with a morning? Yet the morning is no better than you'; Oh, what a night you are! As if its stars... were tied to Mount Yadhbul with every twisted rope.",

    "text": "'As if the Pleiades were hung in their place ... By ropes of flax to hard rocks.'\nAl-Tirimmah said like his saying: \"And the morning is not better than you.\" And he added to it:\n'Lo, O night, become morning ... At Bamm, and the morning is not more relieving than you.'\n'Although for the eyes in the morning is a rest ... By their casting their glances every cast.'\nSimilar is the saying of the other:\n'O night, would that you were eternal forever ... There is no relief in the morning for a lover.'\nAnother said like his saying \"by ropes of flax\":\n'I watch in the sky the Daughters of Na'sh (Ursa Major) ... And if I could, I would be a driver for them.'\n'As if the night tied its two sides ... And its middle with strong ropes.'\nAnother said:\n'A night prolonged, not separating from a direction ... As if it is hobbled over the face of the earth.'\n'Morning did not leave my hand if I won it ... Even if a blaze and anklet appeared from it.'\nBashar said:\n'O my two friends, what is the matter with the darkness, it does not leave ... And why does the pillar of morning not become clear?'\n'Did the illuminating day lose its way ... Or is time a night as if it does not leave?'\n'And the night prolonged upon me until as if it ... Is joined by two nights so it does not budge.'\nAnother said:\n'As if the dark night is a blind hobbled one ... Confused in a wilderness of earth, unknown.'\n'As if the darkness when it lowered its curtains ... Spends the night upon a night joined by a night.'\nIbn al-Riqa' said similar:\n'And as if my night when its sun sets ... Is joined with the blackness of another like it.'\n'I watch the stars, if a star sets ... I see another like the lamp roaming.'\nAsram bin Humayd said:\n'And a night long of two sides I crossed ... In grief while tears run pouring.'\n'Its stars are weary upon it as if ... Its stars are fettered from moving.'\nAnother said:\n'What is the matter with the stars of the night, they do not set ... As if they are pulled from behind them?'\n'Stationary, nothing set in its west ... Nor did a star appear from its east.'\nAl-Farazdaq mentioned the cause in the length of the night, saying:\n'They say the night is long, and the night was not long ... But the one who weeps from longing stays awake.'\nBashar said:\n'My night was not long, but I did not sleep ... And a phantom that visited exiled slumber from me.'\nAl-Ajjaj said:\n'The night prolonged for the one who did not sleep ... And the eye fevered the fever of the sick.'\nAli bin Muhammad bin Nasr bin Bassam said:\n'I do not wrong the night nor claim ... That the stars of the night do not set.'\n'My night is as she wished, if she was not generous ... It was long, and if she was generous, then my night is short.'\nBashar said:\n'I say while my night increases in length ... Is there no day for the night after them?'\n'My eye refused closing until ... As if its eyelids are short for it.'\nFrom the beautiful speech on the length of the night, even if it has no simile, is the saying of Al-Nabigha:\n'Leave me to a tiring worry, O Umayma ... And a night I endure, slow of stars.'\n'It hesitated until I said it is not ending ... And the one who tends the stars is not returning.'\nIbn al-Ahnaf excelled in his saying also:\n'O sleepers around me, help ... Me against the night for reward and recompense.'\n'Tell me a hadith about the day ... Or describe it, for I have forgotten the day.'\nSa'id bin Humayd al-Katib said:\n'O night, nay O eternity ... Is tomorrow sleeping away from you?'\n'O night, if you met what ... I meet in it or find.'\n'You would have shortened from your length or ... Endurance would have weakened from you.'\n'I complain to an unjust woman ... She complains of what she does not find.'\n'Stopped upon her is my glance ... Stopped upon her is sleeplessness.'\nThe chapter in this is wider than we can confine in this section.\nAl-Harith bin Khalid said:\n'Come help me against the night, for it ... Upon every eye that does not sleep is long.'\nUmar bin Shabbah mentioned that Al-Harith bin Khalid's verse is an origin in mentioning the length of the night.\nKhalid al-Katib said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'You slept and did not pity the sleepless ... And the night of the lover is without end.'\n'And you did not know after the departure of slum... ber what tears did to my eye.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'Many a night as if it is Time in length ... Has reached the limit so there is no increase in it.'\n'Having stars as if they are stars of ... Gray hair, not disappearing but increasing.'\nChapter 40 On the Palpitation of the Heart\nFrom the beautiful simile in the palpitation of the heart and its attachment is the saying of Abd al-Rahman bin Hassan bin Thabit:\n'As if my heart is in the claws of a bird ...

He made fly by Layla a bird that was in my chest.'\nChapter 41 On the Perishing of People\nFrom the beautiful simile in the perishing of people is the saying of Adi bin Zaid:\n'Where is Kisra, Kisra of the kings, Abu Sa... san, or where before him is Sabur?'\n'And the Banu al-Asfar (Romans), the noble ones, kings of the ... Rum, none of them remains mentioned.'\n'And the brother of Al-Hadr (Al-Satirun), when he built it and when the ... Tigris was levied to him and the Khabur.'\n'He built it high with marble and covered it with lime ... So for the birds in its peaks are nests.'\n'The uncertainty of death did not fear him, so the ... Kingdom separated from him, so his door is abandoned.'\n'And consider the Lord of Al-Khawarnaq when he over... looked one day, and for guidance is thinking.'\n'His state pleased him and the abundance of what he ... owns, and the sea appearing and Al-Sadir.'\n'So his heart refrained and he said: Then what is the en... vy of a living one who becomes towards death?'\n'Then they became as if they were leaves that dried ... So the East wind and West wind played with them.'\n'Then after prosperity and kingdom and na... tion, the graves hid them there.'\nNafi' bin Laqit al-Faq'asi said:\n'So if I decayed, I have lived long as if I am ... A branch the winds bend, moist.'\n'And likewise, truly, whoever lives long, the ... Cycle of time and turning wears him out.'\nAl-Nabigha al-Ja'di said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And injustice is only upon its people ... And people are only like these trees.'\n'You see the branch in the prime of you... th shaking from green joys.'\n'A time of the age, then it twisted ... So it returned to yellowness then broke.'\nThe other said:\n'And people decay as trees decay.'\nAnother said:\n'We were like two branches in a root that grew tall ... For a time with the best of what trees grow for.'\n'Until when it was said their branches have grown long ... And their clusters ripened and the fruit was tasty.'\n'The uncertainty of time bent upon one, and ... Time does not remain upon anything nor leave.'\n'We were like stars of a night in whose middle is a moon ... Clearing the darkness, then the moon fell from among them.'\nSimilar is for Al-Ta'i:\n'As if Banu Nabhan on the day of his death ... Were stars of a sky from among which the full moon fell.'\nIbn Munadhir said:",

So among [us] is one standing and one harvested.'\nThe meaning for Al-Tirimmah is:\n'Man is only like the sprouting of crops ... Whenever his harvester comes.'\nAnother said:\n'Indeed youth, whenever gray hair settles in it ... Is like the branch in which tender leaves yellow.'\n'Gray hair you treat so that you may hide it ... Is like your selling the garment folded over a burn.'\nLabid said:\n'And man is only like the meteor and its light ... Returns to ashes after it was shining.'\nIbn al-Rumi stole it and said:\n'The return of the youth is senility or death ... And the return of the bright lamps is ashes (Ramdad).'\nAl-Ja'di said:\n'And Time and Days left of me ... As they left of a Yemeni sharp sword.'\nThe sword, when its time is old and it rusts, its iron becomes pure and it is cleared of its rust.\nMuawiyah quoted to Masqala bin Hubayra:\n'Your time left of your friend ... Like the rock of the stone-throwers.'\n'Enemies aimed at me before you ... So I refrained from injustices.'\nAl-Nimr bin Tawlab said:\n'As if a scraper in the hands of a Harithi woman ... Skilled, stripped the skin off me from above.'\n'The youth desires length of safety striving ... But how do you see length of safety do?'\nSimilar to it is for Humayd bin Thawr al-Hilali:\n'I see my sight has confused me after health ... And suffice you as a disease that you become healthy and safe.'\nTha'lab recited to us:\n'My spear was not soft for a presser ... So morning and evening softened it.'\n'I prayed to my Lord for safety striving ... To grant me health, and lo, safety is a disease.'\nIbn Munadhir said to Abu al-Ayna when he grew old: How are you? He said: In a disease that people wish for.\nAbu al-Atahiya said:\n'His completeness hastened in the decrease of a man ... O you whose days have become distant.'\nHe also has:\n'And I rejoice in the world at every increase ... And my increase in it is the decrease.'\nAmr bin Qami'ah said:\n'As if I, having exceeded ninety years ...

That I am shackled, where is a shackle?'\nA man said to an old man he saw walking: Who shackled you, O Sheikh? He said: The one who twists your shackle, meaning Time.\nAnother said:\n'I see the passing of years took from me ... As the waning took from the crescent moon.'\nAl-Akhtal said:\n'O fighter of Allah (curse), the connection of songstresses when ... They became certain that you are of those whom old age weakened.'\n'They turned away when my bow bent its stringer ... And the hair turned white after the blackness of the lock.'\nAnother said:\n'An old man bent and the flesh of his bones perished ... The bending of the yellow Nab' (wood) in the string.'\nConnected to this chapter is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\n'The time of the glance that used to captivate ... The hearts of oryxes has passed, so make tears flow.'\n'As if a youth that was mine, they robbed it ... Past time clothed me from it an exposing [garment].'\nIbn Muqbil said:\n'O free one, the blackness of the head has become mixed ... With the grayness of the occiput, the mixing of purity with turbidity.'\n'O free one, whoever apologizes that the uncertainty of time ... Befalls him, then indeed I am not apologizing.'\nMy father, may Allah have mercy on him, recited to me, he said: Hammud al-Tayalisi recited to us, he said: Abu al-Bayda' recited to us from Shu'bah bin al-Hajjaj:\n'O who is for a Sheikh whose flesh has wrinkled ... He wore out three turbans, colored.'\n'Black, pitch-dark, and a worn striped one ... And he renewed a color after that, white.'\n'Then death is behind all that ... And as if he means by that other than us.'\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'And gray hair rises in youth as if it is ... A night, on its sides a day shouts.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding cutting gray hair:\n'And the early mornings and late afternoons refused leaving me ... Until I dyed with the scissors.'\n'Hairs I cut and they return ... The return of arrows into the targets.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Do you not see gray hair on my head, encompassing ... My trickery failed against it and my capacity narrowed with it?'\n'As if the scissors that take turns on it ... Are beaks of birds picking the ears of corn.'\nHe said:\n'And you still hope for obtaining Salma and her love ... And you become distant until the wiping places (Masaih) became white from you.'\n'Gray hair filled your eyebrows until as if it is ... Gazelles, among them ran a Sani'h (auspicious) and a Barih (ominous).'\nKuthayyir said:\n'The wiping places of the sides of his head are separated ...

To hold it, or the chest of its broadcaster narrowed.'\nChapter 42 On Praising Gray Hair\nDi'bil said praising gray hair:\n'Welcome and ease to gray hair, for it is ... The mark of the chaste and the ornament of the pious.'\n'And as if my gray hair is a string of shining pearls ... In the crown of a noble crowned king.'\nAli bin al-Jahm said:\n'Lumun uncovered the veil from me ... Then turned away while her tears were pouring.'\n'She denied what she saw on my head and said ... Is it gray hair or strung pearls?'\n'I said the first of them is on my head, so you are ... A moan provoked by the worried one.'\nMuslim, Victim of the Songstresses, said:\n'Gray hair is hateful, and hateful is that you part from it ... Wonder at a thing loved despite hatred.'\n'Youth passes and a successor may come for it ... But gray hair goes, missing with missing.'\nAbd al-Samad bin al-Mu'adhdhal said:\n'My gray hair appeared so I remained frolicking in it ... The frolic of the horse in the adorned bridle.'\n'And youth turned away, so I increased in error ... In the fields of my falsehood when it turned away.'\n'Indeed, he whom Time grieved with something ... Is the most worthy man to be consoled.'\n'Do you see me grieving myself when ... Time grieved me? No, by my life, never.'\nFrom the good said in praising gray hair is the saying of the poet:\n'And gray hair, if it settles, then behind it ... Is a life during which is a breathing space.'\n'Gray hair did not decrease a nail clipping from me ... Now when I seem more intelligent and wiser.'\nThe first verse is taken from the saying of Imru' al-Qays:\n'Lo, indeed after poverty for a man is acquisition ... And after gray hair is length of life and clothing.'\nAbu Awn al-Katib said:\n'She mocked when she saw my gray hair, and are there ... Any adornment for the sky other than lamps (stars)?'\n'And she turned away, so I said a saying with clarity ... To her, not by symbol and gesture.'\n'Indeed gray hair in the partings is like the light ... Appeared, and blackness is like darkness.'\n'White, and whiteness belongs to water and the sea ... Together, so its creation is from water.'\n'And it is the color of the sky as long as the ... Greenness of the atmosphere does not interpose before the color of the sky.'\n'And it is the color of the cup which the right... eous were promised, no headache from it upon the boon companions.'\n'Like the ingot of silver and pearls, met ... The shell of water in it the drop of rain clouds.'\n'And if it was shackled with dye, then like gold ... In the throat of a dark tender girl.'\n'You did not fault, when you faulted gray hair, except ... A turban from the turbans of the wise.'\n'It granted sovereignty and an ornament of glory ... And dignity appearing on the great.'\n'There is no escape from gray hair or dea... th, so be for the soul or for growth.'\n'Indeed, a life I was compensated in it from dea... th with gray hair is of the greatest blessings.'\nMahmud al-Warraq said condemning dye:\n'O dyer of gray hair which ... Returns in every third (day/time).'\n'Indeed the fading, when it fades ... Then it is as if it is new gray hair.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said apologizing for that (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And they said: The fading is new gray hair ... So I said: The dye is new youth.'\n'The offense of this is with the goodness of that ... So if this returns, then this returns.'\nAnother said regarding baldness:\n'By your life, indeed I and Abu Rabi' ... Upon the uncertainty of accidents and death.'\n'Both of us, everything from his occiput ... To the cheeks is from the head of the fetus.'\nAnother said:\n'Sulayma said, while the old man goes bald ... What is the head of Dhat (him) except a forehead entirely.'\nIbn al-A'rabi recited:\n'A creator created his head without an iron tool ... So his parting is from between his ears entirely.'\n'Two sides like the two feathers (of an arrow) and a head ... The sharp fly slips from it so it falls.'\nAnother said:\n'The passing of time that passed wore out my bones ... And I was exchanged for a head, three heads.'\n'Two sides like the two feathers and a head ... The sharp fly slips from it so it is knocked out.'\nChapter 43 On Poetry\nFrom the beautiful simile in mentioning poetry is the saying of Habib bin Aws al-Ta'i:\n'And by Allah, I will not cease gifting stray (poems) ... To you, carrying the sifted praise.'\n'You imagine with them a cloak upon you, beautified ... And you think them a necklace upon you, detailed.'\n'More delicious than comfort (Salwa) and better in scent ... Than musk opened, and easier to carry.'\n'Lighter on a spirit and heavier in value ... And shorter in the hearing of the sitter and longer.'\n'And a people boast of them while not praised by them ... If the narrator represented or exemplified with them.'\nAdi bin al-Riqa' said:\n'And a poem I spent the night gathering between it ... Until I straightened its inclination and leaning.'",

    "text": "'The look of the straightener at the joints of his spear ... Until his straightening set right its deviation.'\nThe poet is allowed to praise his poetry as he is allowed to name the children of Caliphs and Chiefs. Ibn al-Rumi said in a poem of his for Abu Muhammad Ubaydullah bin Sulayman bin Wahb:\n'Take it, loving towards you, an Arab woman ... Bending in grace and coquetry.'\n'I did not say take it for anything except cus... tom, and poetry rides terrors.'\n'Speech that discards Kunyas and names ... Whoever it names and does not care a care.'\n'Ignorant (Jahili - proud) as you knew, but ... You do not see him dealing with the ignorant.'\nAmong what we mentioned of what is permissible for them is the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n'Rhymes obey regarding you so as if ... Their poem flows to you from a run.'\n'So how many woven embroideries of mine regarding you ... When recited, a man stood asking for its repetition.'\nAl-Ta'i said praising Dinar bin Abdullah:\n'And the noble (Qarm), the thick (Masamik), knew that he ... Will drown in the sea which you are wading.'\n'Just as the would-be poets knew that they ... Are slow from the poetry which I am reciting.'\n'As if I am a Dinar calling out: Is there a man ... To duel when I called out who will compete in poetry?'\nAnother said:\n'And indeed I am gifting from my praise a poem ... You see for the cousin of truth Qays bin Malik.'\n'I shake his side with it in the club of the tribe ... As my side shook with the white grazing camels.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'Indeed rhymes and endeavors ceased not ... Like the string when it hits a unique pearl.'\n'It is scattered jewel, so if you composed it ... With poetry, it was necklaces and strings.'\n'Because of that, the first Arabs were ... Calling this a praised sovereignty.'\n'And high deeds flee from them except high deeds ... For which the ropes of poems made fetters.'\nAli bin al-Jahm said:\n'But the kindness of the Caliph Ja'far ... Called me to what I said regarding him of poetry.'\n'So it traveled the travel of the sun in every town ... And blew the blowing of the wind in land and sea.'\nAshja' al-Sulami said:\n'The noble deeds of Ja'far and his actions went ... Among people like the paths of the sun.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'And rhymes came to you after a benefit ... As flowers open after the heavy rain.'\n'And whoever is boasting with poetry, praising in ... Its folds, then with you poems boast.'\nHe also said:\n'And I used to, if I found your love slow, visited you ... With a striped poetry like the beautified cloak.'\n'Blame with the tips of rhymes as if it is ... Stabbing with the tips of broken spears.'\n'So I clear with it the face of brotherhood and clear ... A shyness like the dye of the safflower purple.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'So take it from a poet thankful to you ... Even if the natures moved the noble and incited.'\n'Favor did not increase in you by praise a fame ... But it is like musk encountering a stirrer.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'Did I not grant you in it the composition of poems ... They are stars that led stars with the night?'\n'Praise, as if the garden from it is blossoming ... In the forenoon, and as if embroidery in it is marked.'\nIbn al-Rumi said in a poem mocking in it:\n'Take it to you, striving, traveling ... Among people, from Bedouin and city dweller.'\n'Going early upon you with a pebble thrower and dusty ... And upon the narrators with selected pearls.'\nAl-Asha said:\n'If you threaten me, I threaten you with its like ... And I will add the remaining stinging ones.'\n'Rhymes like examples, widening his skin ... As you increased the gores in the width of the shirt.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'To you rhymes pulling, intending ... Their bright embroidery travels and is embellished.'\n'And shining in the composition, noble ones, increasing them ... In splendor and beauty that they are composed for you.'\n'Guarantors for needs, either intercessors ... Accepted, or judges ruling.'\n'And how many went early for me while it is traveling poetry ... And went from me while it is marked wealth.'\nAl-Ta'i said at the end of a poem of his:\n'It was shod the shoe of the Hadrami woman, thinned ... So the running and tongues answered it.'\n'Human, wild, multiplied by it ... The movements of the people of earth while it is stillness.'\n'As for meanings, they are virgins when ... Presented, but rhymes are deflowered (previously used).'\n'The making of the conscience gave it to you, extended by ... A well (Jafr) when the spring of speech dries up.'\n'And he thinks bad of kindness, not like one who ... Comes to you while he is fascinated by his poetry.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'And poems did not turn away from you a turn ... Nor left a virtue for another to be counted.'",

And good poetry remains even if its sayer dies.'\nIbn Harmah said:\n'Indeed I am a man, I do not craft jewelry, making it ... My two hands, but my tongue is the crafter of words.'\nIbn Hazim said describing verses of his:\n'So I send them four and five ... With words straightened, sweet.'\n'So they were, if I branded a people with them ... Like collars of pigeons in the necks.'\nIbn Harmah said similar:\n'Indeed I, if a man his ostrich (pride) lightened ... In ignorance, and the strands of thongs strengthened from him.'\n'I tied at the meeting of the jugulars of his upper chest ... The collar of the pigeon, not wearing out over time.'\nA man from Banu Haram mocked Al-Farazdaq, so his family brought him to him bound. Al-Farazdaq said:\n'So whoever is fearful of the trivialities of my poetry ... Then Banu Haram have been safe from satire.'\n'They led their fool and feared ... Poems like collars of pigeons.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'He gifted me with what every giver is incapable of ... And I composed what every weaver is incapable of.'\n'So the praise of the lean ones deprived him of my praises ... And the gift of the fierce opponent deprived me of the paths.'\n'And there is no rainer for a rainy spring ... And there is no weaver for a flowering garden.'\nChapter 44 On the Description of the Penis\nIbn al-Rumi said describing a penis:\n'As if the voice of the stout buttock ... In the ass of the possessor of the heavy rump.'\n'Is the sound of the kneader's hand in the dough ... Or the foot of a treader walking in mud.'\n'A thick penis in a fat vulva ... Of a tender girl, abundant of buttock.'\n'She humbled, not for piety and religion ... Under a youth established in her heart.'\n'The humility of the duck to the falcon.'\nAnother said:\n'And a glans (Fisha), an adornment and not exposing ... Skillful at times and at times firm.'\n'As if it is a weight of a thousand, weighing down.'\nRashid bin Ishaq said mourning his penis:\n'For long you stood like the minaret shaking a shaking ... Eyes rise to it.'\n'Many a day I lifted my clothes in it ... So as if I, in my walk, am circumcised (implying erection visible).'\nJahshawayh said (Munsarih Meter):\n'I saw a gazelle coupled with a camel ... Walking with a penis as if it is a fish.'\n'So he fucked me, may I not lack his fucking ... The fucking of the violent stallion to the mare.'\nAbu Na'amah said (Munsarih Meter):\n'As if it, while palms touch it ... Is the neck of a male ostrich without a beak.'\n'He had an erection until as if his anus ... Is tied in the twitch (Ziyar) of a veterinarian.'\nAmrah bint al-Hammadiyah said:\n'I describe a donkey who is all penis ... His hoof, his head, and his shadow.'\n'He had an erection until his horse-cloth flew off him ... As if the fever of Khaybar wearies him.'\n'Inserting it is a year and a year is pulling it out.'\nAnother said:\n'I describe a penis from the penises of the Zutt ... Never bent nor lowered.'\n'As if it was cut on a cutting board ... As if it is the bald head of a Coptic sheikh.'\nAnother said:\n'And a glans that came from Hijaz ... In its head is a disease of lichen.'\n'Lightning from erection like the blue (eyes) of the falcon.'\nBaydun, slave of Ibn Ammar, said in opposite of that:\n'So do you have use for a penis I was bereaved of half of it ... And the third after the half of it and the tenth?'\n'So nothing remained of it except something as if it is ... On the likeness of the button of the coat, of yellow brass.'\nRashid al-Katib has similes regarding his penis, among them:\n'He sleeps on the palm of the girl and at times ... He has movements the palm does not sense.'\n'As the two-day-old chick raises its head ... To its parents then weakness overtakes it.'\n'He circled above the testicles as if he is ... A rope on the head of the well coiled.'\nHe has:\n'A penis weak of back, worn of powers ... If I wanted to tie it, it would be tied.'\n'If he touches like the herb in its softness ... For long he became like the peg.'\nHe has:\n'He crooked and the two ends evened ... Like the Dal from the script of the book.'\nHe has (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And you used to fill the palm of the girl ...

You hear the rubbing in it after rubbing.'\n'Like the creaking of the loosened saddle ... Or the rubbing of a brass-worker rubbing hard.'\nAl-Najim said mentioning a slave girl:\n'Indeed the buttocks of the girl are the dough of a baker ... And her front is a cheese of leather.'\nAmrah bint al-Humaris said:\n'O who guides a bachelor to a bachelor ... To the daughter of Al-Humaris the hairy Sheikh.'\n'Scraped of the two loins, pug-nosed of the vulva ... As if the meat of his clitoris (Kayn) when it turned.'\n'Is a pomegranate crumbled for a feverish sick person.'\nAl-Jahiz recited for Al-Farazdaq:\n'So they spent the night beside me thrown down ... And I spent the night breaking the seals of the ring.'\n'As if the splits of pomegranate in them ... And ember of Ghadha they sat upon is hot.'\nAnother said:\n'O Lord of a tender one from the daughters of Karak ... Walking with a frowning (vulva) like the face of the Turk.'\nSuhaym said:\n'I saw her leaning like the drowsy ... Of the gazelles, the shy beautiful ones.'\n'Walking with the like of the Jayshani cup.'\nAl-Umani said:\n'Indeed I hope from the giving of my Lord ... And from the Crown Prince after the outcome.'\n'A Roman woman I insert my lizard (penis) in ... She has a vulva raised like the cup.'\n'Firm, excellent is the proximity of the penis.'\nAnother said:\n'So she brought close a wide one, malicious of the split ... When a fucker fucks it, it bubbles.'\n'The bubbling of the jar in the hand of the drawer of water.'\nAl-Farazdaq said regarding a black woman:\n'O Lord of a tender one from the daughters of Zanj ... Walking with an oven intense of heat.'\n'Pug-nosed like the Khalanj (wood) cup.'\nAsha Sulaym said and saw his wife dyeing and she was black:\n'She dyes a palm that was cut from her wrist ... So the henna dyes from her blackness.'\n'As if she, while the kohl is in her applicator ... Kohls her eyes with some of her skin.'\nJarir said regarding a black man he saw wearing a new garment:\n'As if he, when he appeared to the people ... Is the penis of a donkey wrapped in paper.'\nChapter 46 On Black Women\nConnected to that is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi regarding a black woman (Munsarih Meter):\n'In the softness of a sable chosen by the ... Furrier or the softness of the neck of the weasel.'\n'A branch of ebony familiar to ... An admirer wearing a waist-wrapper and belted.'\n'Love earned her that she dyed ...

From her mouth like antique pearls.'\n'As if she, while joking makes her laugh ... Is a night whose darkness was torn by dawn.'\n'She has a private part borrowing its heat ...

The knot of the lasso increases in tightness.'\n'It has, when the strong one mixes with it ... A bite like the taking of the strangler by the neck.'\n'It is fitting for it to stand from a male ... Like the sword cutting the double coat of mail.'\n'Indeed the sheaths of swords, most of them ... Are black, and the sheath is not worn out.'\nAnother said regarding black women:\n'Resembling youth and musk, I ransom ...

White women, while white women resemble gray hair?'\nAbu Hafs al-Shatranji said:\n'Musk resembled you and she resembled it ... Standing in its color, sitting.'\n'No doubt since your color is one ... That you are from one clay.'\nAnother said:\n'I love black women for the sake of Tuktam ... And for her sake I loved whoever was black.'\n'So bring me the like of musk better in scent ...

    "text": "'The transformation of color did not disgrace her in my view ... It is a dye like the color of youth.'\nA Bedouin said (Munsarih Meter):\n'From her skin is her boot and her veil ... A Houri in other than the creation of Houris.'\nBashar said, although there is no simile in it, regarding a black woman:\n'The mole is in a pure cheek ... So it earns it saltiness and beauty.'\n'And pleases it to the eyes of its onlookers ... So how about if you saw the color as a mole?'\nChapter 47 On Embracing\nFrom the simile in embracing is the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n'That is Ni'am, if she favored with a union ... We would have thanked in the union the favor of Ni'am.'\n'She forgot the standing of the pebbles and our persons ... Are like a person, I threw the pebbles and she throws.'\nBakr bin Kharijah said:\n'I saw your person in my sleep embracing me ... As the Lam of the writer embraces the Alif.'\nAl-Buhturi said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And I did not forget our night in embracing ... The East wind wrapped a branch with a branch.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'As if I embraced a basil ... Breathing in its cold night.'\n'If you saw us in the shirt of darkness ... You would have thought us in one body.'\nAli bin al-Jahm excelled in his saying:\n'May Allah water a night that joined us after a slumber ... And brought a heart close to a tortured heart.'\n'So we spent the night together, if a glass ... Of wine were spilled between us, it would not leak.'\nBashar said, and Ibn al-Jahm took it from him:\n'I was alone with her, water does not pass between us ... Until the morning, without me is a doorkeeper and curtains.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'Long did leg wrap around leg for us until the morning ... In a veil of kissing ... And a waist-wrapper of embracing.'\nChapter 48 On the Taylasan (Shawl)\nAl-Hamdawi said (Munsarih Meter):\n'He comes to you in a torn jubbah ... The longest lifespans of its like is a day.'\n'And a Taylasan like the mirage he wears ... Over a shirt as if it is a cloud.'\nHe has regarding the Taylasan of Ibn Harb good similes, among them:\n'Indeed Ibn Harb was generous to me, clothing ... With a decrepit, old Taylasan.'\n'Look at the abundance of its tearing ... As if it was torn in a funeral.'\n'He threw it to him while it is rotten like one who ... Builds a building over a demolished one.'\n'The glance splits it with its flashing ... The splitting of the heart of the infatuated lover.'\n'Its abundance of tearing reminds me ... Of the scattering of people from the Season (Hajj).'\nHe also has:\n'And a Taylasan, if you contemplated it ... You cut it by length and width.'\n'As if my pity for it when ... I went early is my pity for my honor.'\n'If it were some of the sons of Adam ... It would have been the prisoner of Allah on earth.'\nBy some Andalusians:\n'Your servant Al-Warraq since he per... sisted does not take anything.'\n'And upon him is a Taylasan ... Which Time has folded a folding.'\n'Whenever he patched a star (hole) ... The Pleiades rose in it.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding it:\n'O Ibn Harb, you clothed me a Taylasan ... Darning is planted in it while it is salt marshes.'\n'Cracks fly in length and width ... In it until as if they are rooks (chess).'\nAl-Hamdawi said:\n'And a Taylasan, if you contemplated it ... Persisted in tearing in obstinacy.'\n'As if it, from the length of my darning it ... Owns me since it became in my ownership.'\nHe also has:\n'O Ibn Harb, you prolonged my poverty by my darning ... A Taylasan you were rich from.'\n'So it is in darning the family of Pharaoh in expo... sure to the Fire morning and evening.'\nHe also has:\n'And a decrepit Taylasan, protected ... Against it is eating vinegar and herbs.'\n'As if my ankles when they joined ... Upon it were, for fear of wind, in shackles.'\nIbn al-Rumi said in this meaning:\n'And I have a thin Taylasan except that it ... Is firm to the gusts of shaking winds.'\n'And that is only because it is torn ... Leaving the way for the wind without dispute.'\n'I see it like the light of the sun by eye vision ... And it prevents me from touching it with fingers.'\n'It complained of the heaviness of the name Taylasan for its weakness ... So I named it San (Law/Tongue?), so does that benefit me?'\nAl-Hamduni said:\n'A Taylasan that ceased not to be older in time ... Than Time, its darner has no trick.'\n'And you see its weakness like the weakness of an old woman ... Of shabby condition, possessing poverty, supporting family.'\n'Patches flooded it so it is like a city (Misr) ... Inhabited by strangers of every tribe.'\nHe has (Munsarih Meter):\n'Say to Ibn Harb the saying of the blamer ... And I am not a liar in what I say.'\n'Did you not see the darner trying me ... With his darning your gone Taylasan.'\n'The generosity of decay annihilated it upon him as ... Passion annihilated the heart of Khalid al-Katib.'\nChapter 49",

I left you in it like the slit Qaba' (outer garment).'\nA woman came to Al-Mughira bin Shu'bah with her husband seeking help against him and mentioning he is impotent. He said:\n'Allah knows, O Mughira, that I ... Have trodden her the treading of the released stallion.'\n'And took her the taking of the butcher his sheep ... Hurrying, slaughtering it for guests descending.'\nAl-Mughira said: Indeed I see that in your characteristics. Similar to it is the saying of Al-Buhturi (Munsarih Meter):\n'She did not step out the door of the hallway going out ... Except her anklet was with the earring.'\nAbu Nuwas said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Be gentle a little, you have hurt me ... And joined my earring to his anklets.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding a songstress:\n'O Ahmad bin Sa'id, if you saw her ... When palms are anklets for her legs.'\nFor Abu Nuwas:\n'And a fawn, they do not weary of his proximity ... They have joined his earrings and his heels.'\nChapter 50\nAl-Buhturi said regarding Ibrahim bin al-Mudabbir:\n'You came near in humility and became far in rank ... So your two matters are lowness and elevation.'\n'Thus the sun is far from being rivaled ... And the light and ray come near from it.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'And I saved him for time, I know that he ... Is like the fortress in it for whom there is a return.'\n'And I saw him like the sun, if it is not attained ... Then its light and kindness are attained from it.'\nSa'id bin Humayd said:\n'I fear and am shy and watch his promise ... Neither he starts with me nor I ask.'\n'He is the sun, its course is far and its light ... Is near, and my heart is entrusted with the far.'\nAnother said:\n'And indeed I and she and her visit to us ... Are like the sun, it reached us and we do not reach it.'\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'I saw you like the lightning, it is thought that it ... Is near, while the nearest of its rain is far from you.'\nShabib bin al-Barsa' said:\n'And she was like lightning the eye watched its light ... And did not know after the watching where it pours.'\nChapter 51 On Fear and Confusion\nAl-Tirimmah said:\n'It increased me in love for myself that I ... Am hateful to every man of no benefit.'\n'When he sees me he cuts the glance between him ... And me, the action of the knowing feigning ignorance.'\n'I filled the earth against him until as if it ... From tightness in his eyes is the net of a hunter.'\nThe other said:\n'As if the lands of Allah, while wide ... Upon the frightened terrified one, are the net of a hunter.'\nThe other said:\n'It is conveyed to him that every hill ... He intends throws a killer at him.'\n'As if the lands of Allah, while wide ... Upon everyone you sought, are the net of a hunter.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding a prisoner:\n'He overlooked him so he remained out of confusion seeing ... The land as sea and the open space as narrow.'\n'And he crossed the Tigris wading and as if it ... Is a cup spilled at the door of Al-Kahil.'\n'Were it not for the agitation of fear in his vitals ... The flood would have sunk with him so he died drowned.'\nChapter 52\nDhu al-Rumma said mocking a man claiming lineage:\n'If he were from Kalb, a pure core, I would have mocked him ... But I was informed he is not from Kalb.'\n'But I was informed that he is stuck on ... As the crack of the cup is stuck [patched] from other than it.'\nAbu Nuwas said mocking Ashja':\n'He went out and his talk regarding it ... Is for one who wonders, a wonder.'\n'To names which Ashja' names ... When he traces lineage.'\n'He knows them and his brothers ... So all of them are defenders of it.'\n'They have in their house a lineage ... And in the middle of the assembly a lineage.'\n'As an unveiled woman is not hidden ... And she is hidden when she veils.'\nHe has:\n'O claimer of Sulayma foolishly ... You are not of her, not even a fingernail clipping.'\n'You are only stuck on like a Waw ... Stuck in the spelling unjustly to Amr.'\nHassan said:\n'And you are a bastard added to the family of Hashim ... As the single cup is tied behind the rider.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'And moving from a group into a group ... So as if your mother or your father is mercury.'\nChapter 53 On Generosity and Munificence\nAbu Tammam al-Ta'i recited to us:\n'So eat it beside the table if a ... Strong wind came early cutting the firm tent ropes.'\n'And the father of orphans, they grow at his door ... The growth of chicks in a fertile shelter.'\nSimilar is the saying of Bashar:\n'The birds fall where the grain scatters ... And the houses of the generous are covered.'\nAl-Jahiz recited:\n'People crowd at his door ... And the sweet watering place is crowded.'\nAl-Ta'i said mourning Khalid bin Yazid (Mutaqarib Meter):",

As if their presence is for giving.'\nFor Abu Nuwas:\n'You see people in groups to the door of his house ... As if they are legs of crawling locusts and locusts.'\nDi'bil said regarding a man appointed over Sindh:\n'And this sea used not to be crossed ... Except by one fearful of his sin or risking.'\n'So he became for one who frequents your generosity, populated ... As if upon him are firm bridges.'\nChapter 54 On the Wind\nIbn al-Rumi said describing a wind:\n'And a North wind cold of breeze ... Twisted upon the worried one with worries.'\n'And breathed on him the breath of the worried ... Walking in the night with gossip.'\n'Between the breeze of the earth and the nose.'\nSimilar is his saying regarding a wind:\n'As if its breeze is the fragrance of lavender ... A succeeding rain followed it after the first rain.'\n'A gift of a North wind blew at night ... For the branches of boughs, having a secret conversation with it.'\n'If its breaths breezed early ... The empty hearted breathed for it like the sad one.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'O many a night all of it is magic (dawn-time) ... Exposed of the full moon, sick of breeze.'\n'The breaths pick up the cold of dew ... In it, so they gift it to the heat of worries.'\n'I did not know the morning from its night ... For it did not appear except in the face of the boon companion.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'Dew anchored in your club and the winds ... Breathed a breath in your courtyard, weak.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'A North wind greeted you from us, its phantom circled ... A garden, so it exploded spirit and basil.'\n'It blew early so the branch whispered to its companion ... Secretly with it, and the birds called out openly.'\n'Doves singing on green drooping branches ... Rising with it and touching the earth at times.'\n'You imagine its bird intoxicated from joy ... And the branch from his shaking his sides intoxicated.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'As if the wind and the rain whispering ... Their thoughts are blame and apology.'\n'As if the circle of the Tigris when it came ... In its entirety is a crescent or a bracelet.'\nSa'id bin Humayd said in similar:\n'The winds moved it so the plants moderated ... And its tall ones leaned with the short.'\n'Seeking refuge some with some like people ... In repeated blame and apology.'\nAl-Alawi al-Kufi said:\n'And as if its flowers ... Shake with the stormy wind.'\n'Fringes of maidservants meeting ... In it to fringes of maidservants.'\nChapter 55 On the Sideburn (Sudgh)\nAbdullah bin al-Mu'tazz said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And a cupbearer obedient to his loved ones ... Against the watchers, strong of boldness.'\n'And in the curve of the sideburn is a mole for him ... Just as the polo stick snatched the ball.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'As if the line of the sideburn in the heat of her face ... Is the remains of breaths with the finger of a creator.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'With the palm of a gazelle possessing sideburn hair and a lock ... And two sideburns (curls) like the two Qafs from the sides of a line.'\nMani said:\n'The water of bliss in his cheek is saffron-dyed ... And the sideburn of him is like the curve of the Ra.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'A fawn wanders in the beauty of his image ... Languor played with the glance of his eye.'\n'So as if the scorpion of his sideburn (curl) stood ... When it approached the fire of his cheek.'\nHe also said:\n'I was afflicted with a fawn like the full moon in beauty ... Torturing me with types of coquetry.'\n'The tunic of his cheek is a fresh rose ... And the Nun of the sideburn is dotted with a mole.'\nIshaq bin Ibrahim al-Mawsili said (Hazaj Meter):\n'Gazelles like Dinars ... Sweeping in the chambers.'\n'Palm Sundays revealed them ... To us in wasp-waists.'\n'And they scorpion-curled sideburns ... Like the tails of starlings.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said (Munsarih Meter):\n'What is the matter with my beloved, lazy of thought ... And has shunned his beauty and decoration.'\n'And the sideburn has turned away from his beauties ... Like a polo stick returning its hit.'\nChapter 56\nConnected to that is the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz:\n'He has an eye that shoots hearts and a cheek ... In which light opens from every side.'\n'And his cheeks grew sideburn hair with two lines they straightened ... As writing marked in the parchment of a writer.'\nIn this meaning, even if it has no simile, is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi:\n'Growing hair around his rose gardens ... Beauty has struck upon his cheeks.'\n'His cheeks, then the mole in his cheeks ... Are his Labbayk (response) coupled to his Sa'dayk (happiness).'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And a gazelle wearing a tunic ... In a Qaba', girded.'\n'Allah adorned his cheek ... With a suspended sideburn hair.'\nHe has:\n'As if his two sideburns on a moon on ... A branch on a sand dune, moist of soil, wet.'",

Is a field of myrtle on rose and eglantine.'\n'And he drew his mustache above the veil of pearls ... With half a Sad and the Dal of the sideburn is like the Nun.'\nAnother said:\n'He has from the eyes of wild beasts a sick eye ...

So it came like half of the Sad from the hand of a writer.'\nChapter 57 On the Description of Pools and Buildings\nAl-Buhturi said to Al-Mu'tazz congratulating him on a building:\n'When you completed deliberation and resolve ... You worked your opinion in building.'\n'Pigeons were terrified while cooing above it ... From a sight dangerous to slip, frightening.'\n'And as if the walls of glass in its air ...

For the festival of Christians and their breakfast.'\n'So among one binding her hair ... And one repairing the knot of her belt.'\n'And a fountain, its revenge is in the sky ... So it does not fall short of its revenge.'\nAl-Buhturi said describing a pool:\n'O one who sees the beautiful pool, its sight ... And the friendly women when their dwellings appeared.'\n'What is the matter with the Tigris like the jealous competing with it ... In beauty at times and at times boasting.'\n'As if the Jinn of Solomon who undertook ... Its creation, so they were precise in its meanings.'\n'So if Bilqis passed by it from the side ... She would say it is the Palace (Sarh) in representation and simile.'\n'Delegations of water pour into it rushing ... Like horses coming out of the rope of their race.'\n'As if white silver flowing ... From ingots runs in its channels.'\n'If the East wind topped it, it showed it tracks ... Like coats of mail, polished are its edges.'\n'If the stars appeared in its sides ... At night, you thought a sky was installed in it.'\n'The confined fish does not reach its limit ... Due to the distance of what is between its far and near.'\n'They swim in it with winged middles ... Like birds swooping in the air with their wings.'\n'As if it, when it cleared in its pouring ... Is the palm of the Caliph when its valley flowed.'\nAbu Awn al-Katib said (Munsarih Meter):\n'A pool of amusement a king built ... Its sides continue to shine with him.'\n'So the yellowness of gold dust in its sitting places ... Is to the flash of silver and alabaster.'\n'Like the face of a virgin frightened by shame ... So her cheek in its whiteness is red.'\n'It overflowed so it remained smiling revealing foam ... Like pearls of a necklace scattering from its string.'\n'Then it flooded onto the gardens as ... The palms of Ja'far overflow with generosity.'\n'As if it, when it seeks water then wa... ters the meadow from the rain of the Tigris, is more abundant.'\n'Drinkers whom the vines hosted, so they are ... Sons of its grapes which are pressed.'\nIbn Abi Tahir said:\n'A fountain emitting water from it ... As you melted white silver.'\n'The earth rained the sky with it.'\nChapter 58 On Scarcity\nZuhair said describing a desolate land:\n'And a blind desert not crossed ... Except by the courageous possessor of a guiding heart.'\n'Barren, I dozed in it while not sleeping ... And the arm of the one casting the chest (camel) was my pillow.'\n'And I knew it is not an abode of residence ...

Likewise the flood of water quenches and drowns.'\nAbu al-Atahiya said:\n'It is a world like a snake spitting poi... son even if the touch softened.'\nAl-Buhturi said to Abu Sa'id:\n'With a magnificent one from Tayy, as if his shirt ... Is buttoned upon the two Sheikhs Zayd and Hatim.'\n'Generosity and might like thunderbolts and rain ... If they gathered in a cumulus cloud.'\nIbn al-Rumi said to Abu al-Husayn (Munsarih Meter):\n'You never left me from your favors the ... Bright nor from your wars the biting.'\n'You dispense rain in its thunderbolts ... And at times in its pouring buckets.'\nAbu al-Shis said:\n'And like the sword, if you softened it, its flat softened ... And its edge, if you roughened it, is two roughs.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'If she struts, her two sides emit fragrance ... As the East wind strutted on the garden.'\n'And her coquetry is beautiful while death is in it ... And the polished sword may be considered beautiful.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding songstresses:\n'Of the brown supple ones if they became lank ... And the turn of death is in the brown supple ones.'\n'Resembling spears, shafts of backs ... And wounding in hearts without a spearhead.'\n'So is there from a strike or from a spearhead ... Like an eye or like a mouth or like a fingertip?'\nAl-Surayhi said similar:\n'Misery and bliss meet you from his traits ... Like fire, in its nature is burning and light.'\nChapter 63\nAl-Hutay'ah said mocking his mother:\n'Step aside and sit far from me ... May Allah relieve the worlds of you.'\n'A sieve if you are entrusted with a secret ... And a stove upon the conversers.'\nKa'b bin Zuhair said:\n'And she does not hold to the covenant she made ... Except as sieves hold water.'\nMahmud said regarding his servant:\n'The most resembling of one who entrusts the secret to his slave ... Is like the thrower of sand between the sticks of a sieve.'\nAnother said:\n'May it be hard on me for morals you were branded with ... Among creation, O Faludhaj of the market.'\n'You are impatient with the secret if you are singled out with it ... Until it is seen spreading like blowing in the trumpet.'\nChapter 64 On the Lineage of the Mean\nMuhammad bin Munadhir said:\n'So be harsh on the lineage of the mean for indeed ... The lineage of the mean to Al-Zubayr is glass.'\nHassan bin Thabit said:\n'And the trust of the Murri where I met him ... Is like the glass bottle, its crack is not mended.'\nAl-Asha said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'So she separated and left in the heart ... A crack upon her distance so it flew.'\n'Like the crack of the glass bottle, the palm of ... The craftsman cannot make it return.'\nAbu Uthman al-Najim said mocking:\n'You have an honor chipped of glass ... And a face smooth of iron.'\nAnother said:\n'And I have not seen like turning away a better sight ... If it was from one whom one does not fear regarding connection.'\n'And she swore an oath like glass, thin ... And she swore only to break it for my sake.'\nAnother said:\n'If they made me swear the Ghamus (false oath), I granted them ... An oath like the names of the torn cloak.'\n'And if they made me swear by divorce, I returned her ... To the best of what she was as if she was not divorced.'\n'And if they made me swear by manumission, then ... The mean one of my slave knew he is not freed.'\nIn the thinness of the oath, from beautiful simile is the saying of Al-Buhturi:\n'They asked me for the oath, so I was terrified of them ... So that they acknowledge that terror.'\n'Then I passed it like the descending of the tor... rent falling from the high place.'\nChapter 65 On Frost and Foam\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'And the white of the frost became as if it is ... Upon the tops of the plants, teased cotton.'\nAl-Arji said:\n'As if the falling of snow, what it pelted with ... On the earth, is cotton or flour being sifted.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said describing a land:\n'I was sleepless in it while the riders, their heads inclining ... Wade the shallows of slumber while they have heaviness.'\n'The ice of the night covered them until as if they are ... Falcons revealed from their perches by the moon.'\nAbu Nuwas said describing the foam of the camel (Madid Meter):",

And his two bowls are from two halves of a lentil.'\n'From an atom, an atom are his loaves ... Hidden from the eye so it is sought.'\n'If sifted with silk, it would have leaked ...

Is snatched from his hands, stolen.'\nAbu Nuwas said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'He brought us a bread having sourness ... Resembling dirhams in its ornament.'\n'Its taste sets the eater's teeth on edge ... And it sticks in the throat from its roughness.'\nAbu Nuwas said regarding Ibn Abi Sahl bin Nawbakht:\n'And his bread is only like the jackal, his son sees him ... And did not see the jackal in the rugged grounds nor the plain.'\n'And his bread is only like a western phoenix ...

Just as you heard of Harut and Marut.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'I ate a loaf at Musa's so he bored me ... And it was like my concern from a western beloved.'\n'He wants an eater whose decrease of his food ... Is like the decrease of writing from dusty dust.'\nChapter 67 On the Impossible Act\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'So you became, from what you have done, like a grasper ... On water, his fingertips did not return with anything.'\nAnother said:\n'And whoever trusts the world is like a grasper ... On water, the gaps of fingers betrayed him.'\nMuslim said:\n'And indeed I and my overlooking you with my ambition ... Am like the seeker of butter from water by churning.'\nAl-Najim said:\n'You did not obtain by your churning water except ... Froth when you threw froth with ignorance.'\nAbu al-Atahiya said (Munsarih Meter):\n'You became not knowing the beautiful nor ... Distinguishing between the ugly and the good.'\n'Indeed he who hopes for your generosity is like one who ... Milks a male goat out of desire for milk.'\nIbn Marwan said regarding a heavy servant of his (Munsarih Meter):\n'He slows until I almost think he ... Encountered a male goat so remained milking him.'\nAnother said:\n'And indeed I and my seeking my need from you ... Am like the melter of fat from the dog's tail.'\nIbn Hazim said (Munsarih Meter):\n'He increases in meanness upon praise as ... The stench of dogs increases with rain.'\n'Indeed he who hopes for your generosity is like ... The washer of excrement from his garment, fuming.'\nAnother said:\n'So I became from Layla in the morning like a looker ... With the morning at the heels of a setting star.'\n'Lo, you have only left, O mother of Malik ...

As if it is in the market a mole.'\n'In it are horses, crouching ... They will not be resurrected until the Resurrection.'\n'In it is terrified whoever gets an... gry from a boy or a girl.'\nHe said regarding the cupping glass:\n'And a green one, not of the daughters of coo... ing, its beak snatches the skin.'\n'Like the slit of the eyes of sandgrouse ... When they fall from their tracks.'\nKhalaf bin Sa'id said mocking the chamberlain of Nasr bin Sayyar (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And your weapon was in a basket ... A cowrie shell hangs in its strap.'\n'The weapon of a man leaving the human ... As if behind his ear is a Hayaqa'ah (noise/blow?).'\n'With every biter, if you rode ... As if you fed it a tumor.'\nAnother said mocking the son of a cupper:\n'O son of one who writes on the ne... cks without an inkwell.'\n'He used not to write on them ...

    "text": "'He has a noose in it are thirty shaved ones ... Their views are white and their bodies red.'\n'If the scribes one day crooked their lines ... Then a line of his is never crooked.'\nAnother said:\n'And the grandfather of Khidash in his writing was ... Of the most writing of people, O Harun, for the Alif.'\nFrom the beautiful said about him, even if it has no simile, is the saying of Ibn Kunasa (Munsarih Meter):\n'Your father, most cunning is the carrier of his baldric ... How many a brave brown (skin) and how many a hero.'\n'He takes from his money and from his blood ... He does not spend the evening in fear of an avenger.'\nChapter 69 On the Wound of the Tongue\nImru' al-Qays said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And that is from news that came to me ... And I was informed of it about Abu al-Aswad.'\n'Even if from the spreading of other than him it came to me ... And the wound of the tongue is like the wound of the hand.'\nAl-Akhtal said:\n'I silenced Banu al-Najjar from you, the high ones ... Of Ma'add knew, and they were for long braying.'\n'Until they submitted while they are in pain from me ... And the saying penetrates what needles do not penetrate.'\nHe has:\n'And a clarifier (poem) from the bone with a sharp sword ... Repels from you the imagination of the broad man.'\n'Your sword or your tongue, and the ... Wide wound is like the most capacious of words.'\nJarir said:\n'My tongue and my sword are both sharp ... And the sword has a less harmful impact than my tongue.'\nAl-Basir said:\n'Indeed I seek refuge for you that you be a target ... For arrows of an archer, if he shoots he kills.'\nAnother said:\n'And the wound of the sword heals so it recovers ... And the wound of time is what the tongue wounded.'\nHassan said:\n'My tongue and my sword are both sharp ... And my tongue reaches what the sword does not reach.'\n'By the life of your father, the good one, O Sa'd, never was dull ... Against me my tongue in calamities nor my hand.'\nSimilar to this, even if it has no simile, is the saying of Yazid bin Mufarrigh:\n'Water washes what you did, and my poetry ... Is firm regarding you in the worn bones.'\nChapter 70\nNahar bin Tawsi'ah said:\n'Khorasan was a land when Yazid was in it ... And every door of good things was open.'\n'So it exchanged a saddle after him, pinching ... As if his face is sprinkled with vinegar.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking Al-Khallal, husband of Qustantin:\n'If you see him bending his side ... Leaning in the saddle from excess arrogance.'\n'High-nosed from his pride ... So if he sniffed vinegar he would bleed.'\nAl-Muhallabi said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And if the people came to you in need ... You cracked for two years in illness.'\n'And you meet them always frowning ... As if you bit on a whey cheese (Maslah).' \nA Bedouin said regarding his cousins:\n'I lost my masters who are as if they are ... Boils on my face bursting upon me.'\n'If I say the disease died between me and them ... A wood-gatherer from them came to another seeking fire.'\nAl-Ta'i said mocking:\n'And a king in his pride and nobility ... And a commoner in his saying and deed.'\n'I offered my praise regarding him seeking his giving ... So he cut the rope of my hope from his connection.'\n'He wonders at my wondering at his miserliness ... As if I came to him with his dismissal.'\nChapter 71 On Pots\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'And the neighbors knew that our pots ... Are guarantors for provisions while the wind is gusting.'\n'Emptied into bowls as if their basins ... Are pools of the desert, of them full and half.'\n'You see around them the seekers as if they are ... Upon an idol in Jahiliyyah devoted.'\nMa'n bin Aws said regarding a pot:\n'When the kindlers leaned towards it, you saw it ... For the speed of its hospitality while it is ignited with thick wood.'\n'You heard a clamor for it when it boiled ... Like the growling of camels roaring when they are startled.'\nUmayyah bin Abi al-Salt said:\n'And his pots in his courtyard ... For the guest are filled, overflowing.'\n'And as if they, with what they are charged ... With and what they heated with, are co-wives.'\n'Froth and gurgling like the gur... gling of stallions when they strut.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said boasting:\n'And the sword is the shepherd of my camels in the drought ... Handing them to pots boiling.'\n'Like the nights, allowed with pouring rain ... Trotting in them with thick fuel.'\n'Their trotting in the march under the saddle.'\nAnother said:\n'As if the sound of the boiling towards it ... Is the jumping of old men to old women.'\nChapter 72 On Gluttony\nIbn al-Rumi said to Ibn Hajib the poet when he invited him and others and hid from them out of sorrow:\n'And a crowd came to you ...

    "text": "'From every sharp-gutted, gluttonous ... Eating what the calculator does not calculate.'\n'His jaws are like the two eras (morning/evening) of his time ... Both of them in his affair are diligent.'\n'As if the chicken in his hand is ... A prey whose lion is trained.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding a glutton:\n'So as if the youth gathers mounts ... That fell or blocks breaches.'\n'A stomach, first, like the mill of the seed ... -oil presser, throwing grain and throwing flour.'\nAnother said:\n'So you strike the five of your hand in Tharid (dish) ... With mouthfuls from you, shrinking in departure.'\n'As if an inkwell in the throat when ... It murmured is the sound of thunder in a cloud.'\nTha'lab recited:\n'He gobbles mouthfuls and ransoms his provision ... He throws into his heart like sandgrouse.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'As if the palms of the people in his bowls ... Are sandgrouse a roaming one did not scare from water.'\nTha'lab recited regarding a glutton:\n'You see every loose-trousered one as if he ... Covers a roof or feeds a water-camel.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding Ibn al-Mudabbir:\n'I did not find my excuse for the trick... ster regarding it, the subtle.'\n'Other than a belly of yours beg... ging when you became persistent.'\n'O enemy of provision, O sna... ke of Moses, the swallower.'\nAnother said:\n'My eye has not seen an eater like him ... Eating with the left together and the right.'\n'His fingertips play in the bowl ... The play of the chess player with the Shah (King/Rook?).'\nA Bedouin said: I never saw my grandmother Zaynab eating but I imagined she was throwing to a human behind her.\nChapter 73 On Mentioning Loved Ones\nAbu al-Atahiya said:\n'Lo, by the One who, if He willed, would not have created distance ... If you were absent from my eye, you were not absent from my heart.'\n'Longing makes me imagine you until as if ... I whisper to you from my proximity even if you were not near me.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'I do not care for thoughts ... And eyes I guard against.'\n'I have from your mention a mirr... or in which I see your face.'\nHe has similar:\n'They say to me while the distance is between me and them ... Layla became far from you and the cause of proximity ended.'\n'So I said to them, while love is exposed by weeping ... If she parted from my eye, she has dwelt in my heart.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'And I was not angry at him then glanced at him ... Except I was pleased and beauty stood excusing him.'\n'Nor did I remember him except as if he had ... Inside the heart an image-maker painting him.'\nFrom the beautiful and witty speech in this meaning is the saying of Al-Hakam bin Qanbar:\n'If you are not with me, then the mention of you is with me ... My heart sees you even if you were hidden from my sight.'\n'The eye sees who it loves and loses him ... And the eye of the heart is not devoid of looking.'\nAl-Najim said:\n'If Ahmad went away from my eyes absent ... He is not absent from the eye of the heart.'\n'He has an image in the heart distance did not cut ... And hands of calamities did not snatch.'\n'I turned to a person of his, not distant ... His dwellings are between the vitals and the chest bones.'\n'If the distance of his dwellings grieved me ... And my paths narrowed upon me in his love.'\nFrom the good simile in that is what Al-Mubarrad recited to us:\n'And she turns an eye in a page of silver ... Its turning tends the fruits of souls.'\n'Indeed I conceal her mention so as if she ... Without the boon companion is my boon companion in my session.'\nChapter 74 On Love\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'So leave the lover from blame, for it is ... The worst medicine for a pained, anxious one.'\n'Do not extinguish passion with blame, for it ... Is like the wind inciting the fire to burn.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'They departed, so my weeping was a full year ... Then I refrained, such is the rule of Labid.'\n'More worthy for the ember of anguish, its extinguishing ... With tears, is that it increases in length of burning.'\nHe also said:\n'She kindled upon you a meteor of fire in the vitals ... With blame at midnight, the sister of the family of Shihab.'\n'Blame resembling madness, as if ... The foolish woman read half a book with it.'\nAl-Khammar said (Munsarih Meter):\n'They said you praised the Imam, I said to them ... I fear I will not limit him with description.'\n'And how can he be given for praises who ... Abu al-Samt was to him a novelty?'\n'As if our reciting his poems ... Is halves of books not harmonious.'\nThe best thing mentioned in this meaning is the saying of Al-Buhturi, even if it has no simile:\n'I found yourself from my self in a status ... Which is the purity between water and wine.'\n'I praise you because I did not find anyone ... Blaming you, and what does the blamer claim?'\nChapter 75\nAl-Nimr bin Tawlab said:",

Then I am like the blade of the sword in the worn scabbard.'\nThat resembles the saying of Ibn Haffan:\n'By my life, if He resurrects in the abode of my exile ... My clothes because eating places narrowed on me.'\n'Then I am nothing but the sword, its scabbard wore out ... It has an ornament from itself while it is bare.'\nHe also has:\n'Men reproach me for my sharpness foolishly ... So I consoled myself, returning and coming.'\n'That I am like the sword, best when seen ... And most feared when met if it is unsheathed.'\nLabid said:\n'So I became like the sword, its scabbard wore out ... The era of the blacksmith aged while the blade is cutting.'\nAbu Haffan said:\n'Durr wondered when she saw my gray hair, so I said to her ... Do not wonder, for the rising of the full moon is in the darkness.'\n'And it startled her wonder that I went in rags ... And Durr did not know that the pearl (Durr) is in the shell.'\nChapter 76 On the One-Eyed\nYahya bin Aktham appointed two one-eyed men to the judiciary of the West and East sides, so Di'bil said:\n'I saw of the major sins two judges ... They are a tale in the two horizons (East/West).'\n'They divided blindness in halves by decree ... As they divided the judiciary of the two sides.'\n'And you think of them one who shook a head ... To look into inheritances and debt.'\n'As if you put a jar on him ... And opened its spigot from a single eye.'\nAnother said:\n'And between us always is a blind man we compose ... Allah may create blind men from the one-eyed.'\nSome of them revealed this meaning describing a one-eyed woman and her lover is one-eyed:\n'She is one-eyed on the right and this ... Is one-eyed on the left, an old waterskin agreed with a cover (Shenn).'\n'Between their persons is a blind man when ... She sat on his right singing.'\nAnother said:\n'Did you not see me and Amr when we run ... To needs, we have no equal.'\n'I walk with him on the right of his hands ... And between us is a blind man.'\nChapter 77 On the Description of Fish, Lawzinaj, and Others\nIbn al-Rumi said asking for fish:\n'And daughters of the Tigris in your courtyard ... Are captive in every battlefield.'\n'Invaded with the likes of armors and some... times with the like of piercing thorns.'\n'White like ingots, nay ... Filled with fat like the Akak (lizards/fat?).'\n'They dispense with the oil seller for their fryer ... And perfume the grillers with grease.'\n'Their appearances were beautiful and helped them ... A taste like the untying of the knots of drawstrings.'\nHe has asking for Lawzinaj from Ibn Bishr in a poem:\n'Lawzinaj does not miss me from you ... When it appears it pleased or caused wonder.'\n'Desire did not close its doors ... Except Zulfat refused to be veiled.'\n'If it wished to go in a rock ... The scent would mock a path for it.'\n'It rotates with puffiness in its bowl ... A rotation, you see the oil for it as a spiral.'\n'Helped in it an appearance informing ... Considered beautiful, assisted a considered sweet.'\n'Dense of stuffing although it is ... Thinner of skin than the breeze of the East wind.'\n'Like the beautiful goodness in his singing ... Complete so he became a striker (proverbial) enchanting.'\n'As if its robes were cut ... From the eyes of rain when it bubbled.'\n'It is thought from the thinness of its crust ... To share with the grasshopper in wings.'\n'If a mouth were formed from its baking ... It would be the bright lustrous-toothed.'\n'Of every white one the youth loves ... To make the palm a mount for it.'\n'Oiled, blue, buried ... Gray, imitating the blue-gray.'\n'Neither if the eye saw it, it recoiled ... Nor if the molar topped it, it recoiled.'\n'Almonds were tasted for it, so no bitterness ... Passed over the taster but he refused.'\n'And critics critiqued the sugar ... And consulted the gilded in its critique.'\nHe said describing a chicken:\n'And a scalded, yellow, Dinar-like ... In price and color, a strong youth led it to you.'\n'A Jawdhabah (pudding) started roaming in its fat ... So the core of almond came in it with sugar.'\n'Yes, the sky there, its downpour remained ... Pouring, and yes the earth remained raining.'\n'We remained peeling its skin from its meat ... So as if gold dust is peeled from silver.'\n'And Qata'if (pancakes) came after that, delicate ... The uvula is pleased with them and the larynx is pleased.'\n'The faces of the Tabarzad (sugar) laughed upon them ... The tear of eyes is squeezed from the oils.'\nAli bin al-Zayyat said:\n'But what I see has consumed me ... With him of food on the table.'\n'And stuffed eggplant you see ...

A hidden group.'\n'How many a people its sweetness deceived ... From its bitterness except the intelligent.'\n'So they rushed into its honeycomb ... And perished like flies.'\nAbu al-Atahiya said (Madid Meter):\n'Every thing has an admonition in it ... It would admonish man if he reasoned.'\n'The world is only like a stage ... Man settled in it and departed.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'And man's life was a driving to death ...

Did not attain the hour it is lost.'\nAl-Qatami said:\n'And I see death as traps for men ... A net used repeatedly for the one who was not caught.'\nTarafa said:\n'By your life, indeed death, whatever the youth missed ... Is like the slackened tether whose two ends are in the hand.'\nAbu al-Atahiya said:\n'Lo, O death, I saw no escape from you ... You came so you did not deviate nor favor.'\n'As if you attacked my gray hair ... As gray hair attacked my youth.'\nHe has:\n'And as if he whom his pit hid ... A figure of him did not appear to an onlooker.'\n'For the hand of death in its subtleness ... regarding the treasure of every compassionate one is a search.'\nHe has:\n'And as if he whom hands buried in the soil ... Was not rich in love when his burier returns.'\n'A body that will be ruined when his soul exits ... Like the house ruined when its dweller exits.'\nHe has:\n'And death is not hidden from anyone ... Of whom I see, yet as if it is hidden.'\n'And I passed by the graves and did not ... Distinguish between the slave and the master.'\nChapter 79\nBashar said:\n'Al-Rabab desires your nearness and fears ... The eye of a slanderer and dreads his listening.'\n'You are from her heart the place of a drink ... She desires drinking it and fears its headache.'\nIbn Harmah said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Abu Khalid loves praise ... And fears the gift of the praiser.'\n'Like a virgin desiring the pleasure of marriage ... And fearing the assault of the marrier.'\nHe has similar:\n'So you are in praise like the virgin, pleases her ... The touch of men and fear bends her heart.'\n'She shows joy at that while she is pitying ... As the Parting (head) fears the hissing of the snake.'\nKuthayyir said:\n'She grants a little scant while she is pitying ... As the Parting fears the hissing of the snake.'\nChapter 80 On Satire\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding Ibn Abi al-Jahm al-Katib:\n'O son of Abu al-Jahm, bundle this kindness ... For in it is a novelty of novelties.'\n'O body of the hill and O face of the target ... O dung of the elephant and O meat of the shell.'",

The rising of a watcher or the rising of a beloved.'\nChapter 81 On Growing a Beard\nSa'id bin Humayd said regarding a boy who grew a beard:\n'Why didn't you, with the water of your face, desire ... The softness of youth, little of sideburn hair?'\n'So now when a beard appeared on your cheek ... It took away your beauty the fill of the grasper's palm.'\n'Like the first juice, the wine of its squeezing returned ...

With its length is the beak of a chick.'\n'A thread cuts him and satisfies the one who ... Surrounds him of it with a Tassuj (weight unit).'\n'He fled to us without his companions ... From the barrier of Gog and Magog.'\nHe has regarding him:\n'The deficiency of brothers reduced his affair ... While he is the brother of humiliation and deficiency.'\n'As if he is the flea, did not miss him ... In smallness of body and pinching.'\nAl-Massisi said regarding a short man:\n'You cut a long cloak for him ... And a leaf from the leaves of mulberry.'\n'Rich, I see him in his mother's womb ... Formed from the sperm of a flea.'\nAl-Najim said regarding Al-Aziz:\n'And absent of opinion, weak, deceived ... Stumbling from blindness in darkness.'\n'Competing in knowledge while he is outnumbered ... His outcome from it is scattered dust.'\n'In the body of a sparrow and the dream of a sparrow.'\nHassan said mocking Banu Abd al-Madan:\n'Leave the strutting and walk a natural walk ... Indeed men possess nerves and masculinity.'\n'There is no harm in the people regarding length and shortness ... Bodies of mules and dreams of sparrows.'\nThen he praised them and said:\n'And we used to say when we saw ... One of body who is counted and of tongue.'\n'As if you, O one given a tongue ... And a body, are from Banu Abd al-Madan.'\nAbu Nuwas said regarding a short woman (Munsarih Meter):\n'She appeared to us in the clothes of her doll ... Dragging her clothes due to her smallness.'\nIbn Abi Hafsa said (Munsarih Meter):\n'Every short girl who became fat ... Blackened, I do not enjoy fucking her.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding a short woman:\n'She remains in the shirt from shortness ... Like a small bird (Sa'wah) in the hollow of a cage (Qaffa'ah).' \n'Short of stature, squat ... Her stature is the stature of a bubble.'\nHe also has:\n'Small of build, squat ... The cap throws her into the forgetfulness.'\n'Her breath kills her sitters ... Due to the proximity of her sipping place to the farting place.'\nAl-Najim said:\n'And a short one, the sun ... Does not make a shadow for his stature.'\n'People stumble over him in the road because of his lowliness.'\nHe has regarding Ibn Ammar:\n'Indeed Ibn Ammar has a stature ... Close of parts to parts.'\n'Poverty and his addiction humbled him ... So length became width in him.'\n'The eye does not see when he appears ... Of him except the head on the ground.'\nChapter 83 On Heavy People (Bores)\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking:\n'O Abu al-Qasim whom I do not know ... Is his essence lead or iron?'\n'You are to me like the water of your well in sum... mer, heavy, upon it is severe cold.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'O many a day I remained grazing its sun ... And as if it is in the air a tear of a fearful one.'\n'I consorted in it with a group who were a speck ... To the eye, not met with a blinking eyelid.'\n'They were winter in it except that I ... From its sun am in the hottest of a summer day.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding a bore:\n'And a bore, as if he is the weight of debt ... Every eye is burdened by him rising.'\n'Allah loaded His earth with its two weights (Thaqalayn - Jinn & Men) ... And created him as an addition to the two weights.'\nAbu Nuwas said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'A bore observing us from near ... If a nosebleed pleased him, he pained.'\n'His appearance has a prick in the vitals ... Like the touch of cupping glasses on the cupped.'\n'I say to him when he comes: May he not come ... Nor a foot transport him to us.'\n'I lost your imagination not from blindness ... And the sound of your speech not from deafness.'\n'Cover with whatever you wish from my sight ... Even with the cloak you are veiled with.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'And a bore whose sitter is in agony ... An hour of him is like the day of separation.'\n'Allah decreed his death since a time ... And death loathed his soul so he is remaining.'\n'I do not name him by his name, it sufficed me ... That he alone is the hated of Iraq.'\nChapter 84 On Crows\nRegarding crows, some poets said:\n'Did a dwelling in Khayb excite you ... And a dwelling in the height of the dune?'\n'As if the croaking crows at its sides ... Are youths who came from Abyssinia and Nubia.'\n'They land as a group and fly separately ... When the sun intends setting.'\nAl-Tirimmah said:\n'And there ran between them on the morning they departed ... From Dhu al-Abariq a croaker, shouting.'\n'Convulsed of sciatica, drooping of wing, as if he ... In the house, following the departing ones, is shackled.'\nAntara said:\n'Those whose separation I expect departed ... And the piebald crow ran at their separation.'",

If it intends to wear out, another is renewed.'\n'Sashed between the collarbones with her feathers ... And a chest like the picked violet, green.'\nAnother said:\n'As if in her upper chest and neck ... When she enabled a writing for the onlookers.'\n'It was from a fine pen ... So it wrote in her neck and upper chest a Nun.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'A caller with the sunrise saddened you ... She called with a leg on the top of a leg (branch).'\n'A thicket dweller calling with sorrow because ... The uncertainty of time called her mate to separation.'\n'Signs of sorrow appear in her voice ... And the mechanism of bowing is seen upon her.'\n'If she could, she would have stripped herself of her collar ... If it was assumed from collars.'\nHe has similar:\n'A ringed one weeping and I saw no weeper ... Appear what appeared of her sorrow, she was not bereaved.'\nAnother said:\n'Decorated of necks, tiger-like are their backs ... Snouted with pearls, green, magnificent.'\n'You see fringes above the secondary feathers as if they are ... Borders of Burds which the weavers perfected.'\n'And from pieces of ruby their eyes were crafted ... Dyeing with henna are fingers of hers.'\nAnother said:\n'And a cooing pigeon kept the eye awake ... And increased the rope of the heart in confusion.'\n'Possessing a collar of emerald resembling ...

They dyed her or she waded in dragon's blood (Jiryal).'\nChapter 86 On Separation\nAl-Basir said:\n'A snatch visited us on the day of departure ... So the snatched look kindled fires of passion.'\n'She waited a little while trembling in fear ... As the sun waits when it becomes straight (noon).'\n'So my glance addressed her with what I conceal ... And I despaired until no sound is known.'\n'And she turned away as youth turned away, slow ... The soul folded a flank against her out of her despair.'\nAl-Buhturi said similar to that:\n'And the litters refused the day they left, indeed there became ... In them the twisted of stature, slender.'\n'A sun shining, and separation is its setting ... From us, and a full moon, and aversion is its eclipse.'\nA Bedouin said:\n'It is lawful for Layla to terrify his heart ... With abandonment, and Layla's sins are forgiven.'\n'So she declined the declination of the sun from its settling place ... So who will inform me in which land is her setting?'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'She approached at separation for a time of parting ... The approach of the sun inclining to the afternoon.'\nAl-Alawi al-Kufi said:\n'And I looked at separation and did not find ... For death, if separation was lost, a messenger.'\n'Indeed calamities, if visualized, would not be ... A seeker of departure by separation or sought for departure.'\n'The Hour (Resurrection), the separation emerged, so as if ... You connected the hours of Resurrection in length.'\nAl-Akhtal said:\n'The residents lightened so they went from you or left early ... And an intention disturbed them, in its turning is change.'\n'As if I am a drinker on the day he became alone with them ... Of coffee which Homs or Jadr contained.'\nSimilar to this is much. Qays bin Dharih said, and his father forced him to divorce his wife Lubna:\n'So oh my sorrow and my pain returned to me ... And the separation of Lubna was like mutilation.'\n'The slanderers surrounded me and disturbed me ... So oh Allah for the obeyed slanderer.'\n'So I became in the morning blaming myself ... For a thing and it is not possible [to undo].'\n'Like a cheated one biting his hands ... His loss became clear after the sale.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And you shot the wound of separation at his heart ... So the tear from his eyelids trickles.'\n'The standing of an hour shook him so as if ... In every limb of his is a heart beating.'\nMani said similar (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'She called me openly to her love ... And did not know that I am her lover.'\n'So I went, and for longing from my parting ... To my feet are tongues speaking.'\nChapter 87 On the Pen and Writing\nSome poets said regarding the pen:\n'And a house in the high desert I built ... With a brown, split of nostrils, bleeding.'\n'As if upon it is a clothing, the slough of a snake ... Resident, so it does not go nor lag behind.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'A pen, what I see, or an orbit runn... ing with what a Divider willed and moving.'",

So who is like it in the fear of the monk?'\n'The spearhead of death in a side ... And the sword of death in a side.'\n'Did you not see in its chest like the spearhead ... And in the butt like the sharp cutting sword?'\nChapter 88\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'And a beard carried by a fool ... Like the two sails when raised.'\n'The wind leads him by it, humiliated ... A rapid leading inciting the jugular veins.'\n'If he dove in the sea with it a dive ... He would catch its whales entirely.'\nDi'bil said:\n'He soils a beard that widened and lengthened ... And macerates it like the maceration of yeast.'\n'O what a beard and grease and gray hair ... As if you ate Madirah (sour milk stew) with it.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'And a beard like the tail of the workhorse ... If it were on Pharaoh.'\n'He would need to carry it with help.'\nHe also has:\n'A man upon whom is a beard ... Of it are the braided locks of his wife.'\n'If Allah gathered the beards ... It would be the trimming of his beard.'\nAl-Najim said, which has no simile:\n'Ibn Shahin has a beard ... His length is half its length.'\n'So he is like Time entirely ... Stumbling in its seasons.'\nChapter 89 On Similes with Exception of Something or Reduction of Something\nFrom similes with exception of something or reduction of something is the saying of Al-Akhtal describing wineskins:\n'They unloaded so they dragged raised ones as if they are ... Men of the Sudan who did not wear shirts.'\n'Al-Shasi': The one raising his legs, and 'Al-Shaghir': The one raising one of them.\nAbu al-Hindi said:\n'Destroyer of wealth and what I gathered ... Seeking pleasures from the water of the grape.'\n'And he brought out the wineskin from its shop ... Raising the two legs, bound of knees.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'And jars like a row of men ... Were set up to dance the Dastband.'\nHe also has:\n'I thought them in the house an army ... Lined up around me standing.'\n'And you see them while they are prostrate ... Empty among the boon companions.'\n'Like heroes of wars ... Killed in them as noble ones.'\nAl-Najim said:\n'And a wine like lightning except that it ... Transgresses against times with shining.'\nAwf bin Muhallim al-Khuza'i said:\n'And a small one I became attached to ... She was of the great trials.'\n'Like the full moon except that she ...

As if he is the bow of a cotton carder without string.'\nHe has:\n'As if he, while the hand of the beautiful woman squeezes him ...

Then cleared while a half of it had set.'\nThe Author said:\nSimile, although better in poetry and more difficult for the poet because he intends hitting the simile, chooses words, guards against grammatical error and absurdity, adorns speech and confines it with rhyme, yet literati, wits, wise men, contemplators, jokers, and effeminates have correct similes and wonderful meanings. We will mention a selected collection of them then return to poetry. And through Allah is success and strength.\nChapter 90 On Anecdotes (Lata'if)\nAbu al-Harith described the sycamore of Ja'far bin Yahya, saying: It was a clothes-stand from where I met it, terrifying.\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'If you were of anything other than yourself, you would not be ...

    "text": "The author of Kalila said: The world is like salt water; whenever the drinker drinks more, he increases in thirst.\nAhmad bin al-Mu'adhdhal said to his brother Abd al-Samad: You are like the extra finger; if cut it hurts, and if left it shames.\nAl-Jammaz used to not let more than three enter his house due to its narrowness. He invited three, but six came to him. They stood man by man behind the door. He counted their legs from behind the door and let them in. When they got into his house, he grumbled. They said: What is the matter? He said: I invited people and did not invite cranes standing on one leg, one leg.\nThe author of Kalila said: Manners remove intoxication from the wise and increase the fool in intoxication, like the day increases the sighted in sight and increases the bat in bad sight.\nAbu Abdullah Ja'far bin Muhammad, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Manners to the fool are like fresh water to the roots of colocynth; the more it is watered, the more bitter it becomes.\nAl-Jahiz said: An effeminate entered the bath and saw a man with a large penis and much hair. He said: Look at the Caliph in a velvet rug.\nA man said to some chiefs: You wrote for me to So-and-so, so it was as if you wrote from you to you.\nIt was said to an effeminate who used to drink the milk of she-donkeys: How did you wake up? He said: Do not ask about one who woke up as the brother of the female donkey.\nThe author of Kalila said: A position attained does not make the wise arrogant, like the mountain which stormy winds do not shake, while the slightest position makes the weak arrogant, like the grass moved by the slightest wind.\nAnother said: Ibn Abbas used to strut in his speech as a man struts in his walk.\nThe author of Kalila said: Company of the good bequeaths good, and company of the wicked bequeaths evil, like the wind; if it passes over stench it carries stench, and if it passes over perfume it carries perfume.\nA man said to a wit: Describe to me the feast of So-and-so. He said: It was as if it were the time of the Barmakids in its beauty.\nA man said to a man: Describe the earthquake to me. He said: Like a horse that shook then returned.\nThe author of Kalila said: Whoever advises one who does not thank him is like one scattering his seed in salt marshes, and whoever advises an arrogant one is like one signaling to the deaf.\nHe also said: The virtue of the possessor of manners is not hidden even if he hid it with his effort, like musk which is hidden and covered, then that does not prevent its scent from spreading.\nAl-Jammaz mentioned a man and said: His standing up among us was like the falling of an ember from winter, due to his coldness.\nThe author of Kalila said: A man of chivalry may be honored without wealth, like the lion who is feared even if crouching, and the rich who has no chivalry is not feared even if rich, like the dog who is despicable to people even if collared and ankleted.\nSome wise men said: Whoever does not accept from his advisors what is heavy on him of what they advise him in, his affair's outcome is not praised, and he is like the sick person who leaves what the doctor prescribes for him and intends what he desires.\nAn old woman said, having seen Talha on the Day of the Camel: Who is this whose face is like a Heraclian dinar? They said: This is Talha. Then she saw Al-Zubayr and said: Who is this who is like a speckled snake licking its lips? It was said: Al-Zubayr. Then she saw Ali, peace be upon him, and said: Who is this who is like Kisra then was restored? They said: Ali bin Abi Talib, Commander of the Faithful.\nThe author of Kalila said: Affection between the righteous is slow to break, fast to connect, like a gold vessel which is slow to break, easy to restore. And affection between the wicked is fast to break, slow to connect, like a pottery vessel, the slightest thing breaks it then there is no connecting it.\nA delegation spoke before Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik and they did not know anything. After them, a man of miserable appearance spoke and was eloquent. Sulayman said: His speech after their speech was like a cloud that laid dust.\nAl-Mu'alla bin al-Zayyat described a man and said: He was like the tongue of a snake in his intelligence.\nIbn al-Rumi said: The month of Ramadan between Sha'ban and Shawwal is like a wooden bead between two pearls.\nAbu Sulayman al-Tunburi said: Sha'ban is a road that does not lead through.\nAnother said: The companion is like the patch in the garment, so seek him matching.\nThe author of Kalila said: The might of the strong enemy is not repelled by the like of submission and humility, just as the grass is only safe from the stormy wind by its yielding to it and bending with it wherever it inclined it.\nHe also said: The enemy is not to be trusted nor slackened even if he showed beauty, for water, even if its heating is prolonged, that does not prevent it from extinguishing fire if poured on it.\nA thief entered upon a sailor, so he described him to his neighbors saying: Tall like the mast, black like the ship's tar, and his thigh is like the rudder. Every craftsman speaks from his craft, as a sailor was once asked: How much remains of the day? He said estimating: A pole's length of sun.\nThe grammarian Al-Mazini heard a rumbling from a man's belly, so he said: This is a hidden fart.\nSa'id bin Humayd said: The work of the Sultan is like the bath (Hammam); he who is in it wants to get out of it, and he who is outside it wants to enter it.\nThe author of Kalila said: The world is like the silkworm; it does not increase in wrapping silk on itself except it increases in distance from exiting it.\nA man described Ibn Muhriz the singer, saying: As if he was created from every heart, for he sings every human what he desires.\nSome wise men said: The intellect is like the sword and experience is like the whetstone.",

For me in the cup something?'\n'Do you think I was anything but ... Like who was before in it?'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking:\n'As if I am with you, you have met my initiative ... With clumsiness, stumbling in it the stumbling of a blind man.'\n'Like one protecting against the flame of fire, so he prepared ... For it, out of ignorance, two shields of naphtha and sulfur.'\n'So it was a help against him what he sought help with ...

The tongue of a pretender in poetry and confused.'\nThe other said:\n'Do you not see that my poetry traveled from me ...

Does not cease to be one of the new novelties.'\n'The owner of the post sent it as ... Some hills of Uhud collapsed.'\n'It traveled without burden or fatigue ... The travel of enduring rhymes, roaming.'\n'As if the winds flew with it ... So they attached it to every possessor of distance.'\n'If his news were like his fart ... Then it would suffice him the provision of the post.'\nHe has regarding that:\n'Abu Hasan Wahb greeted Abu Hasan ... With a fart that flew his beard as tufts.'\n'Then it continued and traveled in the lands for him ... As if it was sent from his rear as a proverb.'\nHe has regarding him:\n'O Wahb, possessor of the fart, do not despair ... For anuses have breaths.'\n'And fart for us another without shyness ... As if you tore a paper.'\nHe has regarding another:\n'A fart in your nape, the lis... tener thinks it a garment of silk being cut.'\nAli bin Jabalah said (Hazaj Meter):\n'Humayd is the refuge of the na... tion in the East and in the West.'\n'As if people are a body and h... e is of them the place of the heart.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding Abu Sa'id when he was imprisoned:\n'And these days are nothing but stages ...

I called out of a night having a morning.'\nSimilar is the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz:\n'Our mounts spent the night to you with us ... Treading the people of fire and barking.'\n'So as if their hands, bloody ... Are searching their night for a morning.'\nFor Al-Buhturi praising Ali bin Murr:\n'Do not blame the gift given, his ambition ... And how can looking tire the eye of the looker?'\n'He mediated time in states, so no smallness ... From the accidents that befall nor greatness.'\n'Like the spear, its cubits are ten and one ...

Like the spear, tube upon tube.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking a man who was with Ibn Ubaydullah bin Sulayman using a poem from which we mentioned verses of simile:\n'I was sleepless as if I spent my night on embers ... Watching slumber between Arcturus and Vega.'\n'And why not, when a despicable pig insults me ... So he decrees upon my sleep and I close my eyes on compulsion.'\n'I will complain to the denier of denial, Qasim ... So he will look into my matter with the two eyes of a falcon.'\n'And I burdened myself regarding you every great thing ... Until I tasked myself with intercession from Amr.'\n'So my answer was that I was blocked, and thus ... Is the answer of the seeker of rain from a grave.'\n'A youth whose face is like abandonment, no connection after it ... And as for his nape, it is connection without abandonment.'\n'And the empowerment of his rope crooked Amr ... As the hand of the boy crooked the line.'\n'And Amr twisted for me an ivy of a thicket ... And prolonged, so he does not care for length nor estimation.'\n'And they nicknamed him River of Buq (Horn) arbitrarily ... And in the scoundrel are resemblances from the horn and the river.'\n'For the stature is of length like a crooked river ... And for the nose of him is the tone of the horn in disbelief.'\nAl-Mutalammis said:\n'And do I have a mother other than her? If I left her ... Allah refused except that I be a son to her.'\n'And I was nothing but like the cutter of his palm ...

A passage for his fangs, the snake would have bitten.'\nSa'id bin Humayd said in this meaning (Munsarih Meter):\n'I did not commit a sin, so if you claimed that ... I committed a sin, it was not intentional.'\n'The hand of its owner may strike the eye ... Yet he does not see cutting it as guidance.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'The month of fasting, even if its sanctity is great ... Is a long month, heavy of shade and movement.'\n'It walks slowly, but when it seeks us ... Neither Al-Sulayk approaches it nor Al-Salakah.'\n'As if it is a seeker of revenge on a horse ... Hard in the trail of a sought one on a mare.'\n'I blame it except a time in which I praise it ... From Isha' until the roosters crow.'\n'If it were a master and we were like slaves to it ... It would be a stingy master, bad of ownership.'\nHe also has:\n'Ramadan, the deviators claim it is blessed ...

And likewise the blessed, there is no little in it.'\n'The days prolong in it with its effort ... So as if the era of yesterday in it is a year.'\n'If it were for those crossing a distance ... I would have thought the span of it a mile.'\nIbn Abi Uyaynah said mocking:\n'Like a father, for the truth of saying when I met him ... And informed him what is in him, I silenced him with a stone.'\n'Your father is a rain for us, we live in his shade ... And you are a locust leaving nothing nor sparing.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking:\n'Smells in your mouth are a falling thing not withstood ... And the face of you is a powder in which is soreness.'\n'And you did not speak except you said an obscenity ... As if your jaws are scissors for honors.'\n'Whenever you spoke, arrows from you are sent ... And your mouth is your bow and honors are targets.'\nSimilar to it which resembles simile from metaphor is the saying of Ibn Haffan:\n'Do not sit conversing on the roads ... If you are one day fearful for your eyes.'\n'The hooves of horses are bows and their arrows ... Are smooth stones and the targets are in the pupils.'\nFor Marwan bin Abi Hafsa:\n'Banu Matar on the day of meeting are as if they are ... Lions having cubs in the thicket of Khaffan.'\n'They protect the neighbor until as if ... Their neighbor has a home between the two Arcturus stars.'\nBetter than it is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi regarding Abu al-Saqr:\n'You meet them while the spears of Al-Khatt are around them ... Like the lion, Khaffan clothed it with thickets.'\nAbu Nuwas said regarding Al-Rashid:\n'An Imam who fears Allah until as if he ... Hopes for His vision morning and evening.'\n'High-nosed, long of forearms, as if ... The baldril of his sword is wrapped with a banner.'\nHe has regarding Muhammad al-Amin:\n'Long of fingers, when he gathers his robe with his baldril ... He covers the skulls while the row is standing.'\nIbrahim bin al-Abbas said mocking (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'So be however you wish and say what you wish ... And flash lightning right and thunder left.'\n'Your meanness saved you, the safety of the fly ... Its filth protected it from being reached.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding Sa'id the Little:\n'O man deceiving himself ... In the group of literati and generous ones.'\n'With the verse he recites its quarter or half ... While bread is blamed at his place and water.'\n'His deception with the buxom girls is a lock of hair ... Dyed with greens and henna.'\n'Do not lie, for your meanness is fading ... Like the fading of that gray lock.'\nAnd for Bishr bin Abi Khazim:\n'For indeed you and your praising Bujayr ... Abu Laja' are as Al-Ala' (bitter tree) was praised.'\n'People see it green from afar ... But bitterness and refusal prevent it.'\nSimilar is Ibn al-Rumi blaming Al-Tawzi:\n'He is not who settled in the place which you ... Are in of generosity and loyalty.'\n'He offered the promise to friends obediently ... And refused after that the offering of sufficiency.'\n'So he became like the willow, leafing to the e... ye and refusing fruiting with all refusal.'\nAl-Alawi al-Kufi said:\n'He loved the blamers because passion alienated him ... From his sleep, so as if sleep is sleeplessness.'\n'Passion left of him a body like air, wasting ... The wind breathes in it while it is missing.'\n'As if his tear, its beginnings run ... As it overflows on its last, returned.'\n'I followed it with a breath whose paths bleed ... As if it is cut from the fever of vitals.'\nSimilar is the saying of the other (Madid Meter):\n'A breath whose paths bleed ... And a moan I do not control.'\n'And what I hide of burns ...

Waterless, and if you flashed, you flashed deceptively.'\nAl-Khansa said mourning her brother Sakhr:\n'Noble, bright-faced, the guides follow him ... As if he is a mountain peak on its head is fire.'\n'Like the Rudayni spear, his secret did not run out ... As if under the fold of the cloak is a wall.'\nAbu Zubayd said regarding his boy when he followed a war in which he was killed:\n'And you have warmed at the heat of their fire ... As the cold one warms from freezing cold.'\n'A palm having a remaining breath shoos away from him ... Birds hovering like the visitors of a wedding.'\n'Soon they will rise over his body ... For they are of the lapping and the biting.'\nIbn al-Rumi said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'O Banu Wahb, by Allah, baffled for you ... Are calamities and their times.'\n'It angers the enemies that you are a group ... The preponderance of its scale became clear.'\n'And the binding of the tips of your pens ... Is like the tips of the spears of its knights.'\n'If they guaranteed the preservation of our properties ... It is as preserving an eye like its eyelids.'\nAbu al-Atahiya said similar:\n'And a man has a protector protecting him ... Just as the protector of the eye is the eyelids.'\nFor Abu Nuwas regarding Al-Fadl bin al-Rabi':\n'As if the overflow of his hands when you ask him ... Is the door of the sky when it opened with rain.'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding Al-Hasan bin Wahb (Munsarih Meter):\n'Abu Ali, his morals are blooming ... Following a rain, and his spirit is holy.'\n'And a pit for speech he opened ... While people are foreign in the like of it, dumb.'\n'He pierced its vitals with a speech, appearing ... As if it is from him a stab of stealth.'\n'Our days in his shadows always ... Are a season of spring and our time is a wedding.'\n'Not like people who have become the rust of ... Life, as if the world with them is a prison.'\n'In distance from them is closeness of relief and the ... Loneliness from their likes is the intimacy.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking Khalid:\n'Convey to Khalid that you are for in... sult and for wounds in your skin a tearing.'\n'A fart in your nape, the lis... tener thinks it a garment of silk being cut.'\n'Meanness stuck humiliation to your nose until ... They are equal, humiliation and the cutting.'\n'That is under the mucus, humiliated, and this ... Is a boil of humiliation that is not lanced.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding Banu Humayd:\n'Graves at the ends of the frontiers as if ... Their locations of them are locations of stars.'\nSimilar is the saying of the other:\n'Poverty threw the youths until as if they are ... At the ends of the horizons of the lands, stars.'\nAl-Ta'i said mourning Humayd al-Tusi:\n'And escaping death was easy, but returned him ... To it the bitter preservation and the rugged character.'\n'And a soul that loathes shame until as if it ... Is disbelief on the day of fright or short of it is disbelief.'\nThis is taken from the saying of Abd Yaghuth the Jew [sic - Abd Yaghuth al-Harithi?]:\n'And if I wished, a high-chested mare would have saved me ... You see behind her the short-haired excellent horses following.'\n'But I protect the right of your father ... And the spears were snatching the protectors.'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding Banu Humayd:\n'My covenant with them is the earth shines if they descend ... In it and the world gathers if they gather.'\n'And Time laughs from them revealing masters ... As if its days from their beauty are a Friday (Jumu'ah/gathering).'",

    "text": "'Whoever did not witness Abu Nasr and his killer ... Has not seen a hyena in whose jaw is a predator (lion).'\n'Why the gloating publicly over lions of war ... Patience annihilated them when panic preserved them.'\nAws bin Hajar said:\n'Unarmed, staying in the unknown alone ... Blindly until they ask the morrow what is the matter.'\n'If you were the passing of nights, you would have been ... Like a secret night, no crescent and no full moon.'\nAl-Akhtal said:\n'As for Kulayb bin Yarbu', they have no ... Visiting nor chest at the noble deeds.'\n'Left behind, and people decree their affair ... While they are in absence and in blindness of what they perceived.'\nJarir said regarding Banu Laja':\n'And the affair is decreed while Taym is absent ... And they are not asked permission while they are witnesses.'\n'And indeed, if you saw the slaves of Taym ... And Taym, you would say which of them are the slaves.'\nAnother said like the poetry of Aws:\n'If you were a land, you would be soft, easy ... And if you were a night, you would be the companion of the full moon.'\n'And if you were water, you would be water of a cloud ... And if you were sleep, you would be the nap of dawn.'\nAnother said:\n'If you were water, you would not be sweet ... Or were a horse, you would not be swift.'\n'Or were meat, you would be dog meat ... Or were a sword, you would be not sharp.'\nAl-Mubarrad recited:\n'If you were water, you would not be pure ... Or were a wind, it would be the West wind.'\n'Or were a cloud, you would not be rainy ... Or were marrow, you would be thin marrow.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking:\n'Do you refuse, Yusuf, the invitation of the belittled ... Woe to the one who carried you nine months.'\n'Clitoral, her clitoris like the bone of her arm ... Steaming, then she came with a blind stinking one.'\n'And you spend the night between facing and turning ... Like the road for a comer and a goer.'\n'Like the two hired men of the saw pulling it ... Disputing in a split of pine.'\nHe has regarding Abu al-Hasan (Munsarih Meter):\n'Intellect was crafted from his stillness, a crafting ... Pleasing, and intelligence was crafted from movement.'\n'Brother of deeds, as if the flowers of stars ... Of the night are printed on his coins.'\n'As if the rain is from the dew of his hand ... And the lightning is from his cheerfulness and his laugh.'\nFor Ali bin Muhammad al-Alawi (Hazaj Meter):\n'And a house we have built, sol... itary like the solitary star.'\n'We raised it upon pil... lars of Indian rods.'\n'On a ridge of sand like ... The gradations of a curly nape.'\nFor Abu Nuwas:\n'And a tent of a watchman at the head of a high place ... The hands of one who seeks it intend slipping.'\n'We put the burdens in it at the scattering of a midday heat ... Crossing (Aburiyyah), blazing without a wick.'\n'It waited a little then returned with a mix ... Of shade in worn dry grass, scant.'\n'As if she has between two sides of an ostrich ... Its breast shied away from a kneeling place and a resting place.'\nHe mentions that he intended the tent of the watchman at the time of midday heat and Aburiyyah means the time of Sirius the Crosser which is in the middle of the sky in intense heat. His saying 'Ta'ayyat qalilan' means the sun moderated in the air then inclined and 'Fa'at' from 'Fay'' and 'Zhill'. 'Zhill' is what the sun did not fall on, and 'Fay'' is what it was on then inclined from. 'Zhill' is for the morning and 'Fay'' for the evening. 'Al-Iba'': Tips of reeds. He likened the watchman's tent to an ostrich not kneeling.\nMuslim bin al-Walid said:\n'So I swore to forget the callers to passion ... And the eye surprised her while the veil is falling.'\n'So she covered with her hands the fruits of her chest ... Like the hands of prisoners weighed down by shackles.'\nAl-Buhturi said mocking (Munsarih Meter):\n'As if in his mouth is a morsel that tied ... His tongue so it twisted on crookedness.'\n'He moves his head, you imagine him ... Having stood from a sneeze on a high place.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'Upon me is a heavy debt, you are its payer ... O you who burdens me my debt is my hope in him.'\n'Do not make me like the hoper of rain, the driest of it ... While only he who hopes for it hopes for the wide step (rain).'\nAl-Najim said regarding Ibn Khabbaz and mentioned his mother:\n'Her anus turned gray with the boys of a vulva ... She rubbed it like the beard of the baker.'\n'Her vulva and her wide anus are like the two ... Seas but they did not separate with a barrier.'\n'My wonder at the houses of the family of Khabbaz ... Is like the houses of chess, all are Munaz (taken?).'\n'How many penises we saw heading for their testicles ... Like the heading of the current to the walnuts.'\nAl-Hutay'ah said:\n'And I praised you deliberately to guide you ... So that you have firm rope and strong building.'\n'So I did not possess that your souls were ... Like a hater of men who hated my clothes and my dressing.'\nAl-Buhturi said praising:\n'A cloud if he gives, a fire if he assaults ... He has the might of the Indian sword in the shaking of the branch.'\n'We sought refuge in his kindness so as if we ... For our protection in it sought refuge in a fortress.'",

The smiling of morning in dark gloom.'\n'Thus is your brother the dew (generosity), if he were human ... He would not be found for the blink of an eye other than smiling.'\n'You returned the luster of my face in its page ... The return of polishing to the splendor of the sharp cutting sword.'\n'And I do not care, and the best speech is its truest ... Whether you saved the water of my face or saved my blood.'\nHattan bin al-Mu'alla said:\n'Were it not for little daughters like the down of sandgrouse ... Crowding around me from some to some.'\n'I would have had a wide roaming place ... In the land of length and width.'\n'But our children among us ... Are our livers walking on the earth.'\nA Bedouin said regarding his children:\n'Indeed chicks from behind Al-Ahshar ... I left them, their eldest is like the youngest.'\n'Incapable of trickery and earning ... My memory to them is like the taste of sugar.'\n'And their passion for me is like the passion of the one-eyed ... For his eye, if it goes he will not see.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'He has a wife, he has partners in her ... Like travelers the road gathers them.'\n'A hundred others are lawful for her husband ... Because his share of her is little.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'O night, how lo... ng it was except for the shortness of prostitution.'\n'I revived it and killed it ... And folded it the folding of the cloak.'\n'Until I saw the sun fol... lowing the full moon in the horizon of the sky.'\n'So as if he and as if she ... Are two cups of wine and water.'\nAnd for Ibn al-Mu'tazz similar:\n'When I saw the full moon in ... The horizon of the sky and it had risen.'\n'And I saw the horn of the sun in ... The horizon of setting and it had dangled.'\n'I likened that and this ... And I see their likeness most clear.'\n'To the face of the beloved when he appeared ... And the back of the beloved when he turned away.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'My eyes, be scarce and do not pour ... My calamity is too great for weeping.'\n'Your leaving the disease hidden ... Is more truthful of the health of loyalty.'\n'Indeed sorrow and weeping of old ... Are two matters like disease and medicine.'\n'And seeking medicine is only ... Seeking a way to survival.'\n'And seeking life after a friend ... His brotherhood of purity lied.'\nAl-Ta'i said asking Abu Sa'id for sympathy for his son:\n'A crescent for us, his light was appearing ... So our eyes are set up when will he initiate it.'\n'He is the sword, sharp, his scabbards wore out ... And was lost until everything notched him.'\nFor Al-Muhallabi mocking Khalid bin Yazid son of his uncle:\n'You were nothing but like the meat of a dead animal ... Necessity called to eating it.'\nMahmud al-Warraq said:\n'I blamed you first until when ... I tested other than you, the blame returned as praise.'\n'So I did not praise you for good but ... I saw other than you worse than you indeed.'\n'So I returned to you in need, humiliated ... Because I did not find from that an escape.'\n'Like an exhausted one who considered eating a dead animal great ... So when forced, he returned to it running.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'My Lord, give me justice from Time for I ... Have no victor over it except You.'\n'People go low and a group rises ... Who separated from peers from every side.'\n'By my life, if we contemplated them ... They did not rise but floated like carcasses.'\n'Carcasses floating on the sea of wealth ... While the hidden things of shells do not float.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'O you who asks me about a group ... The meanness of deeds increases them in elevation.'\n'Thus carcasses of the dead when they rot ... And cavities of water cast them, they rise floating.'\nHe has similar:\n'A time the value of the low rose in it ... And the noble fell, his honor lowers him.'\n'Like the sea, its pearls sink in it ... To the bottom and its carcasses float above it.'\nDi'bil said mocking Al-Hasan bin Wahb:\n'O who turns a scroll (Tumar) and spreads it ... What is in your heart of love for scrolls?'\n'In it is a resemblance of a thing you are pleased with ... Length for length and roundness for roundness.'\nAnd for Ibn Bassam mocking Banat Tumar:\n'For Banat Tumar over their peers ... Is a virtue that will appear in them and become clear.'\n'They will insert their father out of their love ... So the Sheikh is buried in their asses.'\nAnother said similar, who is Al-Baladhuri:\n'O Wahb, O filth of the presence ... You fart in the assembly of the Emir.'\n'I likened his scroll to a penis ... That exceeded in the desire of penises.'\nAnother said:\n'Your pulpit which you left ... Yesterday is still from you like a menstruating woman not purified.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking:\n'The earth menstruates from the footsteps of Bura... n even if between Zamzam and Al-Hatim.'",

Earth from among departing and resident.'\n'She is at night everything you see ... Standing in the darkness like the hill.'\n'She does not tire of kneeling or the birds ... Falling on her back like some roots.'\nAnd he mentioned the width of the vulva, saying:\n'It encompasses the seven regions entirely ... While it is two fingers of a region.'\n'Like the conscience of the heart devouring the world ... And the two sides of a chest contain it.'\nRegarding her he says on the tongue of a Mithqal (weight):\n'Then you tried with the little Mithqal my belitt... lement, but you increased me only in magnification.'\n'Like the one who lowered the torch to hide ... While it is closer for him to blazing.'\nAl-Buhturi said praising:\n'I counted but did not reach a limit for your virtue ... And do the night travelers reach a rising place for the sun?'\n'And I was not in describing you except like a dotard ... Measuring the tracts of the wide earth with cubits.'\nAbu al-Samh said:\n'We drank at the top of the monastery until as if we ... Were kings possessing what is between Hit to Egypt.'\n'So when the sun of the day appeared and shone ... Wealth cleared from us and we returned to poverty.'\nSimilar is the saying of Al-Akhtal:\n'When my friend gave me drink then gave me drink ... Three glasses having a roar.'\n'I went out dragging my tail from me as if I ... Over you, O Commander of the Faithful, am an Emir.'\nIbn al-Dahhak said:\n'And like the white rose he greeted with a rose ... From the rose walking in tunics like the rose.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'Just as wearing out wears out the new garment ... So the glancing eyes wear out the man.'\nThis is of good simile. Among the best proverbs in that is the saying of Al-Ta'i:\n'And the length of a man's stay in the tribe wears out ... His two brocades, so go abroad you will be renewed.'\n'For I saw the sun increased in love ... To people because it is not eternal upon them.'\nIshaq bin Abi Rabi' said:\n'And I enjoy what I desire while death is before it ... Like the drinker of poison in a silvered vessel.'\n'So my illnesses are about to pierce with an illness ... That separates between me and my nurse.'\nIbn al-Rumi said addressing Banu Sulayman bin Wahb:\n'And you are the Tall Palm which grew high ... Of old and the root and the branch of it were blessed.'\n'So if the heart (Jumar) withheld its spadix from me ... Let not the frond hit me with the two edges of its thorn.'\nAnd for Al-Ta'i boasting of his people:\n'They passed and as if the noble deeds with them ... Due to the abundance of what they recommended of them, are laws.'\n'They extend with the cutting white swords, hands ... And they are equal, and the cutting swords.'\nHe said mentioning Amorium when it was burned:\n'You returned the pitch-black night in it while it is forenoon ... A morning of flame chases it in its middle.'\n'As if the black robes of darkness desired ... Away from its color or as if the sun did not set.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding Al-Hasan bin Makhlad:\n'And master of politics, middle ... Between ease and strictness.'\n'Not the inexperienced in the clu... b nor the empty when alone.'\n'Like the sword, cutting while it is un... sheathed and feared while it is sheathed.'\nIbn al-Rumi said praising Sa'id bin Muhammad similar to this:\n'He has an assault hidden in tranquility ... As the Indian sharp sword hid in the scabbard.'\n'If he sheathed it, hearts settled in their place ... And if he unsheathed from it, the muscles trembled.'\nMarwan bin Abi Hafsa said:\n'And opinion is like the sword, blunt if you strike with it ... In its scabbard, and if you unsheathed it, it cuts.'\nAnd for Ibn al-Rumi:\n'Is there a judge, just of judg... ment, fair to me against an unjust woman?'\n'She spent the night with whispers on her outside ... From a clear one like the stars.'\n'And for my inside from her are whis... pers from worries like adversaries.'\n'Difference between the two sta... tes of the connector and the cutter.'\n'How much between the whisper of the je... welry and between the whisper of worries.'\nAnother said:\n'And indeed the speech of a man out of its essence ... Is like arrows falling having no arrowheads.'\nSimilar is the saying of Al-Mutawakkil al-Laythi:\n'And poetry is the core of man, he displays it ... And speech is like the locations of arrows.'\n'Of it is the one falling short of its target ... And penetrating ones taking the stake.'\nMakhlad said mocking:\n'I see you looking at me askance ... As beautiful women looked at gray hair.'\n'You sharpen the pupils at me in rage ... As if I am forgiveness in your eyes.'\nJarir said:\n'A people, if they get angry, their noses are crushed ...

Of its policy like a slave seeking to be sold.'\n'If he is sold nearby, upon him ... Otherwise absconding is an intercessor for him.'\nAbu Nuwas said regarding the swallow:\n'Drink at the sight of the swallow when it appeared ... A cup from whose edges sparks fly.'\n'Most beloved to me of birds, when they appeared ... They came driving to you the light and the flowers.'\n'As if their voices in the air flying ... Are the sound of shears when they cut hair.'\nIbn Munadhir said:\n'And Al-Thaqafi, if he was generous, he clothed him ... And his figure startled you, is nothing but a phantom.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'You are nothing but a phantom whose specter roamed ... And my satire of you is nothing but the rambling of a sleeper.'\nHe also has:\n'And even if I do not mock you except like a dreamer ... Seeing what sleepers see so he rambles.'\n'Because you are devoid of equal, and only ... My conjecture shows you to me while I contemplate.'\n'If you were a fixed thing, then a dust mote ... Diminishes in the eye of certainty and becomes small.'\nDi'bil recited:\n'I offered praise to men other than their money ... An ugly opposite and a wording not good.'\n'So I did not win from them except as carried ... The leg of the mosquito from the pottery of brick.'\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'I was afflicted with praising the misers as if I ... Am stingy with praise towards the generous noble ones.'\n'And I was, having hoped for kindness to a giver ... Like the seeker of gift from a friend who does not connect.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding Ibn Ghiyath, scribe of Sa'd the Chamberlain:\n'I say to Ibn Ghiyath when I saw for him ... A Sheikh, his meanness contains him not the Sheikh.'\n'Why are you proud, cleanliness makes him arrogant ... And why is your father, upon him is humiliation and dirt?'\n'He said: Do not blame us for our disparity ... For we are books, our fathers are drafts (Nusakh).'\nHe also said:\n'And in proverbs is ample room ... The salt marsh may bring out the long-branched palm tree.'\nThe meaning in this simile is for Ahmad bin al-Husayn al-Mutakallim in his saying:\n'The singing of men is copies (Nusakh) drafted by women.'\nFor Ibn al-Mu'tazz in the cemetery of Al-Mahallah:\n'And inhabitants of a house, no visiting between them ... Despite the nearness of some in neighborhood to some.'\n'As if rings of clay are upon them ... So they have no breaking until the Resurrection.'\nIt is taken from the saying of Abu Nuwas:\n'And I neighbored a people, no visiting between them ... And no connection unless it be Resurrection.'\nAbu Uthman al-Najim said:\n'I saw Isma'il in his medicine ... Incapable of a disease and its acquisition.'",

For meanness is the blame of the friend to the friend.'\nAl-Ta'i said:\n'And a blessing from him I wore ... As if it is the border of a new cloak.'\n'Of those which if a grateful one slackened ... Stood for their giver in the place of the preacher.'\nLike this, even if it has no simile, is the saying of Nusayb:\n'So they turned and praised with what you are worthy of ... And if they were silent, the bags would have praised you.'\nThis is like their saying: The tongue of the state is more eloquent than the tongue of complaint.\nAl-Buhturi said:\n'If Ishaq bin Kundajik praises with me ... A land, then all game is in the belly of the wild ass.'\n'If he cut, he hit the joint without missing ... Or spoke he succeeded, or poured he was abundant.'\n'And the promise is like the fresh leaf, bent ... In it are branches, and its success is to bear fruit.'\nHe mentioned in it his scribe Ibn al-Fayyad and said:\n'He performed upon me what is upon him as a source ... For the matter at difficulties and a source.'\n'Accepted, from wherever he came I thought him ... For his acceptance in the soul, he came announcing good news.'\nAnother said:\n'And flies defecated on him until ... As if his defecation is dots of ink.'\nIbn al-Rumi said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'Convey to you Banu Tahir ... Doctors of the Caliphate for its disease.'\n'You rose the rise of the stars of the sky ... So a storm upon us like their storms.'\nAbu Nuwas said mocking:\n'And I did not leave of Aylan except ... As the razors left of the clitoris.'\n'And Kahil and Banu Qu'ayn said ... Your mercy, we are not people.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking:\n'If the legs of his wife were her hands ... Mercy covering her would not have missed her.'\n'Since her legs were created raised ... As if they are asking forgiveness of Allah.'\nSimilar is his saying:\n'They do in it a righteous deed ... Allah raises it to the lowest.'\n'People ask forgiveness with their hands ... And they ask forgiveness with legs.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said (Munsarih Meter):\n'So how many an embrace for us and how many kisses ... Snatched in fear of a watcher.'",

And upon the one who died is a garment of clay.'\n'And as if the thing of what has passed ... And ended is the peck of a sparrow that pecked.'\nAbu Nuwas said describing the ship:\n'O you who prepared resolving on departure ... Intending Baghdad without a sailor.'\n'In the belly of a girl who sufficed you with her movement ... The strutting of every tall and high one.'\n'So as if she, while water butts her chest ... And the bamboo stick is in the hand of the sailor.'\n'Is a black one of the eagles rushing to the darkness ... Falling with a sound and clapping of a wing.'\nAl-Jammaz said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'If you cannot have intercourse ... And you were fond of the love of adultery.'\n'Then you are in that like the whetstone ... It sharpens the iron but does not cut.'\nSimilar is the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And Al-Numayri gave a fatwa to his pimp ... And the fatwa of Al-Numayri is debauchery and stuttering.'\n'For you are a blacksmith sharpening the weapon ... And you have nothing of the killing.'\nAnother said:\n'Dirty of shirt, thick ... Of other than its weft is its warp.'\n'And his undergarment is of his hair ... So as if he is of the skin of a sheep.'\nAl-Asha said:\n'And you were stripped of a kingdom and wealth you gathered ... As spindles were stripped of their threads.'\nThe Arabs say: More stripped than a spindle and more clothed than an onion.\nAbu Nuwas said regarding the Barmakids:\n'They planted the planting of palms trustingly ... And they did not harvest except as vegetables are harvested.'\nIbn al-Rumi said congratulating Abu al-Saqr on an Eid al-Adha in which was Nayruz:\n'Be happy with a festival of a brother of worship and Islam ... And a festival of amusement, open-faced, smiling.'\n'Two festivals, Adha and Nayruz, as if they are ... Two days, your deeds of misery and favor.'\n'Of a sprinkler with what souls are revived by ... And a barrier between souls and bodies.'\n'Likewise are your two days: a day whose gift is rain ... Upon the poor, and a day whose sword is bloody.'\n'I saw the nobles of Allah's creation made ... Heads for people, and you are the eyes of the heads.'\n'You are stars of a sky that has no setting ... And those are more noble than fires of flags (mountains).'\n'And every thing feared you so it clothed itself in a tunnel ... As if it is in its intestines a letter of Idgham (assimilation).'\nMansur bin al-Faraj said:\n'If you come to him, your quarter becomes fertile from him ... While the earth is barren like the cheek of the beardless.'\n'He sought praiseworthy deeds striving, and they are ... Those not contained by a seeker who did not strive.'\nIbn Abi Hafsa said regarding Ibn al-Mu'tazz (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And I trace lineage in your praise as a fifth ... And I hope not to be the last.'\n'He sought praiseworthy deeds striving, and they are ... What bequeathed you your crown and the throne.'\nAl-Ahwas said:\n'Indeed I am envied for what you know ... I grow on hatred and malice.'\n'Indeed I, if men are hidden, you find me ... Like the sun not hidden in any place.'\nAl-Kumayt said:\n'I found people other than Banu Nizar ... And I did not dispraise them as middle and low.'\n'And indeed they are brothers to us, but ... Fingertips of a palm do not equal.'\nAl-Buhturi said similar:\n'And your thought of natures if they equaled ... Is like your thought of fingertips equaling.'\nKuthayyir Azza said:\n'And she was regarding cutting the connection between me and her ... Like one vowing a vow she fulfilled and dissolved.'\n'And I and my infatuation with Azza after ... I relinquished what was between us and she relinquished.'\n'Am like the hoper for the shade of the cloud whenever ... He settles from it for a resting place, it vanishes.'\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'And indeed a man striving to corrupt my wife ... Is like one striving to the lion of Al-Shara to urinate on it.'\n'And short of the urine of the lion is valor ... And the extension of hands whose length prevents injustice.'\nSimilar is the saying of Al-Tirimmah:\n'O Tayy of the plain and mountains, your appointment ... Is like the seeking of game in the den of the lion.'\n'And the lion, whoever seeks game in his courtyard ... Limps with his soul from the end of the body.'\nJamil said:\n'The heart loves you as long as we live, and if I die ... My echo follows your echo among the graves.'\n'Indeed I am looking at you for what you promised ... The look of the poor to the rich wealthy.'\nAl-Hutay'ah said:\n'Do you hide the love of Hind from all people ... While what is hidden by that is not hidden?'\n'So you have nothing but looking at her ... As the poor looks at the rich.'\nAl-Buhturi said mocking:\n'And a prince whom I wrestled from his kindness ...

In it is the mark of the mint of deprivation.'\n'Its appearance is thin and its imagination is thin ... So as if it is a soul without a body.'\n'Or a lover whose beloved became fond of his abandonment ... So he melted him with the heat of abandonment.'\n'He gifted it concealed to a veil ... So I found it more hidden than concealment.'\nHe has regarding it:\n'The dinar of Yahya, that filth ... As if it came from prison.'\n'And in the blowing of the wind it mimics for us ... The turning of the dancer in the wedding.'\n'Sickness has played with its body ... So it is a phantom, stopping of breath.'\n'As if it is in the palm due to lightness ... Its amount is from the yellowness of the sun.'\nUmayyah bin Abi A'idh al-Hudhali said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'O Fatimah, may you be greeted with happiness ... When did we know you? May you not be distant.'\n'As if in my eyes from passion for her ... Is a speck rubbed with the kohl stick.'\nUmar bin Abi Rabi'ah said:\n'So when we stood together I knew what was with her ... Is like what is with me, the matching of the sandal to the sandal.'\n'She said and relaxed the side of the curtain: Only ... My family is with me, so speak without fear.'\nAl-Buhturi said mocking Ibn Ahmad bin Salih:\n'The donkey went mad, so how little is what ... He acquires of acceptance or skill.'\n'So as if the low one commits what he committed ... Of ugliness in a bet or race.'\n'His hands engineered, instead of what ... He seeks, the engineering of the door closing.'\nHe has (Munsarih Meter):\n'And hidden ones in obscurity we tes... ted them so the forbidden dispraised its earner.'\n'They were like the thorns of the Tragacanth, its shep... herd hates it and its gatherer refuses its pleasure.'\nAbu Nuwas said:\n'The slanderers did not lower you from a rank ... With me, nor did a backbiter harm you.'\n'As if they praised and did not know ... You to me with what they faulted.'\nFrom it in simile is his saying:\n'If I came you did not come, and if I did not come ... You came, so this from you to me is a sin.'\n'As if you, even if you do not ... Lie in the appointment, are a liar.'\nBishr bin Abi Khazim said:\n'Lo, convey to Banu Lam a message ... For miserable is the stopping place of the stranger's mount.'\n'If they make a contract for a neighbor they betray him ... As the rope deceived the bucket.'\nThis is contrary to the saying of Al-Hutay'ah:\n'Those are a people, if they built they perfected the building ... And if they covenanted they fulfilled, and if they tied they tightened.'\nJarir said:\n'I used to think there was fabrication in Taym ... And among them a wise one after what they plotted.'\n'Until Taym exposed itself to me to mock it ... As the anus of the one shitting stones exposed itself.'\nSimilar is his saying:\n'As if Banu Tuhayyah, the offspring of Salma ... Are stones of a shitter throwing at dogs.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\n'You do not see his legs except ... An Alif embracing a Lam.'\n'Sleeping, a penis did not rise ... So when he slept, it rose.'\nSimilar is the saying of Abu Nuwas:\n'O ornament of the writers of Diwans ... And philosopher of the wide-eyed virgins.'\n'As if his thighs when joined ... And the penis is in it, are the knot of twenty.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking Al-Akhfash (Munsarih Meter):\n'He did not say poetry nor narrated it, so not ... Its fox was he, no nor its lion.'\n'So if he says: I narrated, then like the ... Notebook ignorant of all it held.'\nAl-Atawi said:\n'And how many said: Wish. So I said: A cup ... Circulated by a branch on a sand dune.'\n'And a boon companion we dropped conversation with ... Like the glance of the scoundrel or the lowering of the watcher.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And my hand is moist for peace ... With attainment, and moist for war with blood.'\n'I preceded my envier to my pride ... Like your preceding with the glance the step of the foot.'\nBashar said:\n'Do not make me like cumin in a farm ... If water misses it, promises suffice it.'\nIbn al-Rumi said similar (Munsarih Meter):\n'How many a haughty one proud of his wealth ... The misguiders misled him before me.'\n'I made him with satire a pepper ... While you made me, his wish, cumin.'\nAnother said:\n'And we are cousins, despite that between us ... Are carpets in which are hatred and competition.'\n'And we are like the crack of the eye, if given a mender ... He leaves it while its defect is conflicting.'\nAl-Mubarrad recited similar:\n'And in us if it is said we reconciled is mutual grudge ... As the hairs of the mange-scabbed grew on the scab.'\n'Al-Jrab': Camels having mange, and its time becomes old so its fur grows on it. 'Al-Nashr': Mange. It is said 'Nashira al-ba'ir'. He says: So we, even if we reconciled after enmity, the grudge is in its state in the hearts. Similar is the saying of Al-Akhtal:",

Similar is the saying of Zufar bin al-Harith:\n'And the pasture may grow on the dung of the soil ... While the sores of souls remain as they are.'\n'Ad-Dimn': Urine and dung behind houses, if rain comes on it, it grows grass. Ibn al-Rumi said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'And how many a spot I thought a garden ... So I found it a dung-heap with grass.'\n'So I was calculating ... So when I calculated, calculation effaced the calculating tool.'\nAl-Buhturi said regarding the race track:\n'O beauty of the start of horses in their earliness ...

And it comes while it is easy, quick.'\n'So it became heavy until I saw for it ... The heaviness of pregnancy, it decreed upon the pregnant.'\n'So I abandoned him and forgot it out of disdain ... That he be a master for my blessing.'\nAbu Alalah Imam al-Hamdawi said regarding a donkey (Munsarih Meter):\n'O asker about the donkey of Tiyab ... That is a donkey ally of ailments.'\n'As if he, while the tail-strap takes him ... From every side, is the shying of syrup (Dushab).' \n'The beauties of the rectum he loves ...

If the sky of today prolonged its flow?'\n'And favor with procrastination is only like a friend ...

Nor what he offered nor what he did.'\n'The henna design of Al-Aruba resembled it, she dyed ... So when the week passed, its design faded.'\nIbn al-Rumi said mocking Al-Akhfash, Al-Mubarrad's boy (Munsarih Meter):\n'As if I am with the wretched one apologizing ... When the rhymes hurt his ear.'\n'He recites the covenant to me on the day of that, and the ... Covenant is a dye he reversed so it faded.'\nBashar said similar:\n'Glory be to Him who created passion for those of trial ... It was nothing but like dye, so it faded.'\nFor Ibn al-Rumi:\n'What we met of the wit of Wahb's fart ... It made the people of our age poets.'\n'It is to me like the generosity of Fadl bin Yahya ... Except that it does not revive the poor.'\nSimilar is the saying of a butcher who was at the door of Al-Fadl bin Yahya:\n'What we met of the generosity of Fadl bin Yahya ... Made all people poets.'\nAbu al-Adhafir said:\n'It taught the mute ones that they spoke ... Poetry about him, and the misers generosity.'\nAl-Ta'i said regarding Malik bin Tawq:\n'What is the matter with me, I see the wide dome locked ... Before me, and for long I have found its lock ugly.'\n'As if it is the Garden of Paradise displayed ... And I have no pure deed so I enter it.'\nAl-Jamal al-Misri said:\n'If a sickness befalls you, befall it ... And call Abu Ja'far for his calamity.'\n'He knows what his companion complains of ... As if he roamed in his joints.'\nAl-Ta'i said mentioning the death of Al-Mu'tasim and the rise of Al-Wathiq:\n'A breaking like the return of the glance you have mended ... O son of Caliphs, what a mending.'\n'Peoples have not seen a sun before it ... Set without following them with darkness.'\nSimilar is the saying of Abu al-Atahiya regarding Al-Amin after Al-Rashid:\n'The eye weeps and the tooth is laughing ... So we are in a funeral and in a wedding.'\n'The riser Al-Amin makes us laugh and ... The death of the Imam yesterday makes us weep.'\nAbdullah bin al-Zubayr said regarding the sandgrouse:\n'She turns in listening a head as if it is ...

And your generosity is hoped for and sought.'\n'You have a current (Jar - salary/river), whenever I said it flowed ...

A Bedouin said to his wife:\n'You seek divorce while you are with me ...

When they are forced, uproot perfume.'\nAnother said:\n'Banu Umayr, their glory is their house ... And every people, for them is glory.'\n'As if they are desert truffles ... They have no before nor after.'\nTarafa said describing the ship:\n'Her bow splits the bubbles of water with it ... As the gambler divided the dust with the hand.'\nIn it from beautiful simile is his saying:\n'I see the grave of a miserly groaner with his money ...

Is like the slackened tether whose two ends are in the hand.'\n'I am the lean man whom you know ... Active like the head of the snake, glowing.'\nLike his saying \"I see the grave of a miserly groaner\" is the saying of Ibn al-Ziba'ra:\n'And gifts are scarce among us ... And equal is the grave of a rich or a poor.'\nAnd for Abu al-Atahiya:\n'And I passed by the graves and did not ... Distinguish between the slave and the master.'\nAnd for Abu Nuwas (Mujtath Meter):\n'O eye, what is the matter with you, when ... You sickened a body, you settled.'\n'So you were like the Jew ...

If they look at the thin cloud.'\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'I will turn away from what Time turned away from ... And drink it pure even if a blamer blamed.'\n'For I saw the cup, O Salm, a friend ... She protected me while my head is turbaned with gray hair.'\n'I connected so she was not stingy to me with her connection ...

Horned like the foolish mountain goat.'\n'A Sheikh adorned upon his confirmation ... With the ornament of the one-eyed and the cross-eyed.'\n'His eyes were equal in his face ... The worst two loads on a camel litter.'\n'I was informed in his house are women ... Wearing the garment of night like the work clothes.'\n'Doing in it a righteous deed ... Allah raises it to the lowest.'\n'People ask forgiveness with their hands ... And they ask forgiveness with legs.'\nAl-Farazdaq said a verse he swore by divorce that Jarir would not invalidate, which is:\n'For indeed I am Death who is descending ... By your soul, so look how you try him.'\nJarir started rolling in the sun until the sun almost set, then he said: I am Abu Hazrah, the wife of the wicked one is divorced. And he said:\n'I am Time, Death perishes and Time is eternal ... So bring me the like of Time, something to match it.'\nThat reached Al-Farazdaq, so he said to the one who informed him: I asked you but to conceal this hadith.\nAnother said:\n'And the saying, you do not own it if it grew ... Like the arrow, the archer who shot does not own it.'\nIbn al-Rumi said reproaching:\n'I showed affection until I did not find one showing affection ... And I bored my pens with repeated reproach.'\n'As if I draw near with you the son of a Jinn ... If the pull draws him near to the chest, he goes further.'\nAl-Jahiz recited:\n'The night of fleas is a night I do not enjoy ... For death is easier than the night of fleas.'\n'As if they and my skin when they were alone with it ...

And Harun had neither slipper nor sandal.'\nDi'bil said:\n'If he faulted me, he faulted only his discipliner ...

Then she turned away from it so it almost wandered.'\n'Woe to him, if she looked and if she turned away ... The falling of arrows and their extraction is painful.'\nSimilar is his saying:\n'For her glance while it is turned away is like its falling ... In the heart when its falling frightens the heart.'\n'She repels with the glance, not like the arrow, turning it ... Away from me, but like the arrow she extracts it.'\nAbu al-Shis said (Munsarih Meter):\n'And a companion I had and I was to him ...

And in his workhorses and in his camels.'\n'The workhorse of Abd al-Aziz is shaken of ... Creation, the so-and-so is above his price.'\n'As if he, while whips take him ... Is a brother of gravity who closed eyes on his grudges.'\nAbu al-Najm said:\n'He approaches the stream like the stream ... He throws into his larynx like the cauldron.'\n'As if the sound of his hurried gulping ... Is a boulder you rolled in stones.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'So they treated a heat from their insides ... With anxiety like the middles of the successive sandgrouse.'\nAnother said (Mutaqarib Meter):\n'So I advise you with the stabbing of the brave ... For you have known that there is no eternity.'\n'And striking skulls the harm of the de... af the colocynth of a ravine gathering seeds.'\nThe deaf, if struck, does not hear, so he intensifies the beating. 'Al-Habid': Seeds of colocynth.\nIbn al-Rumi said:\n'The eye does not cease from looking ... And the soul does not cease from wandering.'\n'And the beauties of things in you are together ... So my two boredoms are the boredoms of Basra.'\n'The enjoyments of your face in its intuition ... Are new, and in their consequences are the others.'\n'And as if your face from its renewal ... Is moving for the eye in forms.'\nHe has (Munsarih Meter):\n'There is nothing except in it is its best ... So the eye moves from it to you.'\n'The benefits of the eye from it are its new ... As if its lasts are the first.'\nHe also has:\n'My glance to your glance when you look is a killing spot ... But your glance is an arrow of death sent.'\n'And of wonders is that one meaning ... It is from you an arrow and it is from me a killing spot.'\nHe also has:\n'She gave him my eye the slumber ... So she rewarded it from him with tears.'\n'A gazelle, as if in his waist ... From his leanness is thirst and hunger.'\nBil'a' bin Qays said:\n'She saw me prostrate from wine one day so I displeased her ... And for the drinkers, the addicted ones, are falling places.'\n'With me is every loose-baldricked one as if he ... When he appears from the sole of the foot is limping.'\nIbn al-Rumi said on the death of Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir:\n'The Emir died and the full moon of our sky died ... This bids us farewell and this eclipses.'\n'A moon saw a moon sacrificing himself ... So a brother, consoling, fair, wept for his brother.'\nJu'ayfaran al-Muwswis said regarding renters:\n'As if they, while life tops them ... And breaths have risen for the people.'\n'Are threshing floors for tax stopped ... When their permission came to them, they trod.'\nIbn al-Rumi said regarding Ubaydullah bin Sulayman:\n'You dispense with all eulogy by your virtue ... The dispensing of gazelles with kohl against using kohl.'\n'Your state shines in the state of Islam ... As if it is the nation of Islam among nations.'\nAnother said:\n'He became sacrificing himself and as if he ... Is a moon covered by darkness with an eclipse.'\n'And decay walked in his body so as if he ... Is a plush rose announcing dryness.'\nAbu al-Hindi excelled in his saying:\n'I gave Abu al-Mutarrah drink when he came to me ... While the possessor of earrings was erect, shouting.'\n'A drink flies flee from ... And the eloquent one lisps when he drinks it.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said describing a rain:\n'It clothes the lands a shirt from its ornaments ... As if it is buttoned over the body of the earth.'\n'Its wild calves remained drowned, thrown down ... As if they are pearls scattered in the horizon.'\nSimilar is the saying of Ibn al-Rumi describing gray hair:\n'As if my spearhead when a star met it ... Hit by it are pieces of cloud, white.'\nThe sitter of the slave girl of Ja'far bin Yahya looked down on the children of the Barmakids while they were playing, so she said:\n'As if they, with the children of the mob in number ... Are pearls and beads scattered on the earth.'\nAl-Jammaz was in love with a slave girl in Basra, and a servant in Basra from the Sultan's servants called Sinan used to overcome him regarding her. Al-Jammaz said (Mudari' Meter):\n'What is for the hateful Sinan ... And for the beautiful gazelles?'\n'Is he not an adulterer, eunuch ... Raiding without a weapon?'\nHe says regarding him (Mujtath Meter):\n'A gazelle, Sinan is my partner ... In him, so what a miserable partner.'\n'For Sinan does not fuck ... And he did not let me fuck.'\nHe says regarding her (Mujtath Meter):\n'I did not think Tughya... n loved Time other than me.'",

    "text": "After the intimacy that was... between her vulva and my member.\n\nAnd another said:\nIf you deny us weapons, we have... a weapon of ours not bought with dirhams.\nBoulders filling the palms, as if they were... heads of men shaved by razors.\n\nAnd another said:\nWar is joined by those who hate it, just as... healthy camels come upon the scabby ones and infect them.\n\nIt is said that war was called 'Ghashum' (Oppressive) because it afflicts the non-perpetrator. The origin of this saying belongs to Al-Harith bin Abbad:\nI was not one of its perpetrators, Allah knows... yet today I burn in its heat.\n\nSimilar to it is the poet's saying:\nYour perpetrator is the one who commits the crime against you, yet... the kneeling places of scabby camels may infect the healthy ones.\n\nIbn al-Rumi said:\nI saw the perpetrators of war were not its sufficient defenders... when the interlocked spears clashed within it.\nLikewise, the flints of fire are safe from it... but the stokers burn in its heat.\n\nAnd another said:\nSpeech is like milked milk; it has no... return. How can the milker return the milk [to the udder]?\nLikewise is speech; it has no... return into the hollow [of the chest], whether ugly or beautiful.\n\nAnd another said:\nO friend, have you seen or heard of a shepherd... who returned to the udder what he drew into the milking vessels?\n\nSimilar to it:\nAnd speech, you do not own it once it rises... like the arrow, the archer who shot it does not own it.\n\nAnd another said about a man who ate very little:\nLittle food in the belly, except for a bit... of provision as an excuse, just as the falcon eats.\n\nA'sha Bahila said:\nA slice of meat suffices him like it... if he touches the roast, and a small cup satisfies his thirst.\n\nTarafa said, mocking Amr bin Hind for eating too much:\nHe drinks until the pure milk overwhelms his heart... but if you give him [food], I leave a roosting place for my heart [i.e., remain alert].\nAnd there is no fault in him except that he is wealthy... and that he has a flank, when he stands, that is slender [sarcastic or contrasting].\n\nThis is the opposite of Urwa bin al-Ward's saying:\nI divide my body among many bodies... and I sip pure water while the water is cold.\n\nAl-A'sha said:\nI saw you yesterday as the best of Banu Ma'add... and you today are better than you were yesterday.\nAnd tomorrow you will increase double upon double... thus do the masters of Abd Shams increase.\n\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said regarding wasps:\nAnd troops I came upon early with fire... that blazes when it senses a wind.\nThe eye was delighted when it saw them falling... like scattered confetti of beautiful pebbles.\nHow many a screamer among them yells and howls... like a wineskin thrown down among drinking companions.\n\nSa'id bin Abd al-Rahman bin Hassan bin Thabit said to his father when a wasp stung him: 'A creature stung me, looking like a Hibara garment.' His father said: 'My son has spoken poetry, by Allah.'\n\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said describing a book:\nSpeckled, having a color like the gray hair of a middle-aged man... you think it has kohl applied, yet it has no kohl.\nA rider of a palm [hand/pen], wherever it wishes, it travels.\n\nAnd another said:\nThey shook the chests of the Mashrafiyah [swords] as if... they were falling upon the skulls of the people into fresh colocynth [melons].\n\nAnd another said:\nI saw you like a walnut; its good is withheld... while whole, and it gives its good when it is broken.\n\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said:\nWhat is wrong with your two chickens, suspended... like the suspension of Harut and Marut?\nPerhaps at dawn they did not wake... a morning drinker at all with crowing.\n\nAnd another said regarding lice:\nAround Abu al-Ala are battlegrounds... between the killed and the wounded.\nAs if they are, at the buttons of his shirt... solitary ones and twins of husked sesame seeds.\n\nAnd among the good things said in this meaning is the saying of Abu Nuwas:\nWhoever's hunting trap is far from him... the trap of Ayyub is his clothes.\nO Lord of one hiding by the side... of the seam, whom correctness surrounds.\nOr a flea-jumper leaping... his leaping did not save him from him.\nHe aimed his finger at him with the slipperiness of the two corners [of the eye]... his finger-tips are his dogs.\n\nJarir said:\nYou see the nits adhering to him... like the goatee of Al-Farazdaq when he went gray.\n\nAl-Hamdawi said:\nI do not see, if I slaughtered Sa'id's sheep... anything obtained in my hands other than the hide.\nNothing but its bones; if you saw them... you would say: These are pine cones in a bag.\n\nAnd another said:\nSodom was unjust in judgment once... and Musa bin Salih is more unjust than him today.\nHe transfers water with us until it is as if... he lunched on coffee beans or dined on salty fish.\n\nDi'bil said:\nHe looks like a ram when he appears... but in his nature, he is a ewe.\nIf you sit by his side... you would think there is a lute in his scrotum.\n\nA man killed a slave girl of his whom he saw flirting with a man, so the man said:",
