I explained this following text [432]. Then it appeared to me while tracking the texts of the book, especially in *Tarikh Baghdad*, that this omission took away a part of 'The People of Kufa', the 'Chapter of the People of Baghdad', and the beginnings of the 'Chapter of the People of Wasit'. So I decided, to complete the benefit and fill some gaps of the mentioned omission, to gather the texts that Al-Khatib extracted in *Tarikh Baghdad* via the route of the narrator of this book, Al-Husayn bin Idris Al-Ansari, from Abu Dawud, from Imam Ahmad. The result of this gathering was twenty-five texts starting with number [571] and ending with number [595]. The first eight of them relate to the people of Kufa, and the rest to the people of Baghdad. I have arranged them alphabetically. In order for the appendix to harmonize with the nature and methodology of the book, I placed the people of Kufa first and presented the texts in the manner they appeared in the book *Al-Su'alat*, removing the chains of narration that Al-Khatib cited so that the methodology of the appendix becomes like the methodology of the original, noting that Al-Khatib extracted all the texts of the mentioned appendix with a single chain from his Sheikh Al-Barqani to Al-Husayn bin Idris from Abu Dawud from Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal.",
