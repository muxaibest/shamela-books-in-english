We seek refuge in Allah from the evils within ourselves and from our bad deeds. Whoever Allah guides, none can misguide; and whoever He allows to go astray, none can guide. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, without partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger.\n\n“O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and do not die except as Muslims.”\n\n“O mankind! Fear your Lord who created you from a single soul, and created from it its spouse, and spread from the two of them many men and women. And fear Allah through whom you ask one another, and (honor) the ties of kinship. Indeed, Allah is ever watching over you.”\n\n“O you who believe! Fear Allah and speak words that are upright. He will rectify your deeds for you and forgive your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly achieved a tremendous success.”\n\nTo proceed: About twenty years ago, while I was still in my first place of migration (Damascus), I had begun printing my book *Da‘if al-Targhib wa al-Tarhib*, and I completed in it …",
    "foot_note": "1. Some preachers add here the phrase: “and we seek His guidance,” but it has no basis in this noble sermon known as (The Sermon of Need) in any of its chains. I had collected these chains in a booklet about the Prophet ﷺ, in which it is clarified that he ﷺ would sometimes recite after it the well-known three verses from Surah Aal ‘Imran, al-Nisa’, and al-Ahzab. Some people rearrange them as they wish, and sometimes they add what is not part of it—without realizing that this contradicts his ﷺ guidance, and that it is not permissible to alter established remembrances, even by changing a single word, even if the meaning does not change! See the commentary on the hadith of al-Bara’ that follows (6 – Nawafil / 9 “al-Sahih”).",

Now that it has become facilitated for someone to undertake its printing and publishing after verifying it anew—that being the virtuous brother Sheikh Saad Al-Rashid—I have re-examined it in the manner I proceeded with its counterpart \"Sahih at-Targhib wa at-Tarhib\". I have explained that in its new introduction, so there is no need to state it here again; whoever desires the details may refer back to it, if Allah the Exalted wills. For this reason, it required me to make the ranks of the hadiths in the book five ranks, instead of the three previously. They are: 1 - Weak (Da'if). This is what contains a defaming defect from the known defects of hadith, such as the weakness of one of its narrators, or disturbance (Idtirab), or denouncability (Nakarah), or anomaly (Shudhudh), and the like. 2 - Very Weak (Da'if Jiddan). This is what has in its chain a narrator who is abandoned (Matruk) or severely weak, whose narrations contain so many denounced reports that it is feared they are of his fabrication, such as one about whom Imam Al-Bukhari says: \"Munkar al-Hadith\" (Denounced in Hadith). 3 - Fabricated (Mawdu'). This is what has in its chain a liar or a fabricator, or where the signs of fabrication are apparent on its text along with a clear defect in its chain. (1) 4 - Denounced (Munkar), or Very Denounced. This is that which has a weak narrator in its chain who contradicted a trustworthy narrator in",

I say: This type does not become apparent except to one who is firmly grounded in this science, with precise insight into the meanings of the texts, widely read in the authentic Sunnah, and gifted with understanding of the Book of Allah and the Hadith of His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The author has sometimes noticed such things; see for example the long hadith of Mu'adh coming under number (27) and Hadith (596).",

This is what a trustworthy narrator relates contradicting one who is more trustworthy than him, especially if he contradicts a group of trustworthy narrators; this can be in the chain (2) and it can be in the text. Know, my brother reader! That the first three ranks are customarily used by the people of knowledge, past and present, unlike the last two ranks: The Denounced (Munkar) and the Anomalous (Shadh)—for they were known in the past but abandoned in modern times except rarely. Therefore, I saw that using them—along with the revival of knowledge that was about to be obliterated involved therein—contains a stronger and clearer explanation of the hadith's defect, just as I did in the other book by using the ranks \"Hasan Sahih\", \"Sahih li-ghayrihi\" (Authentic due to external factors), and \"Hasan li-ghayrihi\" (Good due to external factors) {as a bounty from Allah and favor}. Even though this cost me severe fatigue and strenuous effort, as I explained there, hoping for reward and recompense from Allah, the Mighty and Majestic; for the reward is in proportion to the hardship, especially in the service of the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, distinguishing its weak from its authentic, and preserving his Sunnah which is an explanation of the Book of Allah, Blessed and Exalted. * I decided that the rank from those ranks should be printed in the margin of the page opposite the author's saying: \"From so-and-so...\" and the like. * I did not concern myself in the commentary with explaining their reasons except rarely, such as saying for example: In its chain is so-and-so, and he is weak, or very weak, or a liar, or it contains so-and-so, and he is weak, and he",

I did not commit to mentioning such details except rarely when necessary. However, I deemed it essential to do so in one specific situation: when it becomes clear to me that the author—or someone else—fell into an error by strengthening a hadith or authenticating one of its narrators, or if he hinted toward that. In this case, I committed to clarifying the matter as much as possible to prevent misunderstanding, and so that our fellow readers may gain insight into what we say or what is said.\n\n* A hadith in the book may be attributed to a source that I did not have access to, and thus I could not determine the state of its chain of narration—though this is rare—such as the book *Tajrid as-Sihah* by Razin al-‘Abdari. If, upon examining the text, it appears to me to be inauthentic, I include it in this book of mine without assigning it any rank from the usual categories, and I print in its place the familiar question mark (?), in order to absolve myself of responsibility and to avoid burden. This is in cases where the author did not weaken it or mention its flaw. Otherwise, I classify it as weak, as you will see shortly in the hadith that follows under number (6).\n\n* Sometimes the author cites an authentic hadith, but it contains a sentence or a word that is not authentic—or he cites it through another narration. In such cases, I was uncertain whether to include it in the *Sahih* or in the *Da‘if*, along with the necessary commentary. Similarly, uncertainty arose when the hadith itself was weak but contained a sentence that was authentic. In the first case, I preferred including the hadith in the *Sahih* while removing the unauthentic sentence or word from the text and placing it in the commentary, explaining the reason for its weakness, as I clarified in the introduction to the new edition of the *Sahih*—so there is no need to repeat that here. Conversely, with respect to the weak hadith, I found it appropriate to include it in this…",

I commented on it explaining the authenticity of his saying, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in it: \"Verily Satan has despaired that he would be worshipped in the Arabian Peninsula\", and similar is the hadith of Ibn Abbas under number (32), and many, very many others as the readers will see, if Allah the Exalted wills. An example of what is indicated by dots is the hadith of Abu Darda coming in (5 - Prayer / 10), and its examples in the \"Sahih\" are many. The context of the hadith might assist in excising the authentic sentence from it and printing it in the \"Sahih\", but the hadith might have been cited by the author in the chapter suitable for it without the sentence. For example, the hadith of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade me from reciting while I am bowing, and said: \"O Ali! The likeness of the one who does not straighten his spine...\" The Hadith: He mentioned it in the chapter \"Warning against not completing the bowing...\" due to its relevance to what follows the sentence. So my mentioning it in the \"Sahih\" would be unsuitable for the mentioned chapter as is apparent, so I saw fit to keep it with the hadith, and comment on it stating its authenticity. The author indicated its weakening by prefacing it with his saying: \"Ruwiya\" (It was narrated), but some ignorant people proceeded upon its apparent meaning, so they weakened the hadith without excepting the sentence, as will be explained in the commentary on it there (5 - Prayer / 34). This is what came to mind to mention in this introduction as a methodology for what I proceeded upon in this beneficial book, if Allah the Exalted wills, asking the Master, Glory be to Him and Exalted, to take my hand and grant me success in what He loves and is pleased with of speech and action.

    "text": "placed before my book \"Sahih at-Targhib wa at-Tarhib\", containing numerous chapters and new benefits regarding Al-Mundhiri's book \"At-Targhib\" and its merits, and what is critiqued about him and other authors in the science of Hadith; much of which is difficult to find elsewhere. Nevertheless, I see no necessity to republish it here, because I assume that whoever acquired this will acquire with it its counterpart \"Sahih at-Targhib wa at-Tarhib\", so he will find it in its introduction, so I refer him to it. However, I must present a summary of it that suits the subject of this book. So I say: I have explained therein the terminology of Al-Hafiz Al-Mundhiri, may Allah have mercy on him, in his \"Targhib\", and that he divided his hadiths into two sections: One: He prefaced with the word (An - From), which indicates to him its strength. The other: He prefaced with the word (Ruwiya - It was narrated) in the passive voice, which indicates to him its weakness. And that he included in each of the two sections three categories, and that it is an ambiguous, confusing, and inconsistent division; the general readers can hardly derive his intent from it. I detailed the discussion on that extensively; I do not think anyone addressed it or preceded me to it, and the credit for all of that belongs to Allah alone, and to Him belongs all praise and commendation. Among that is that he included in the first section \"what approached the Sahih and Hasan\"—according to his saying—from what is weak and known for weakness among the Hadith scholars. For he said, following his mentioned statement: \"Likewise if it was: Mursal (hurried), or Munqati' (interrupted), or Mu'dal (problematic/missing two consecutive narrators), or its chain contains an ambiguous narrator... or it was narrated as Marfu' (elevated to the Prophet) while the correct view is it is Mawquf (stopped at a Companion), or connected while the correct view is it is Mursal, or its chain was weak but some of those who extracted it authenticated or improved it\"! And I mentioned some examples there. * And that he sometimes imitated the lenient ones in authentication such as At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim, such as the coming hadiths (2, 29, 34, 35) and others, and this is very frequent. * And among that is that in many hadiths, he says in their extraction: \"Its narrators are trustworthy\" and the like. In that, he is either correct or mistaken. He prefaces it with his first terminology: (An), so one who has no knowledge imagines that the hadith is Sahih or Hasan, while it contains a defaming defect from the defects referred to previously such as Irsal (omission of the first narrator), Inqita' (interruption), and Shudhudh (anomaly); which repels its improvement (Hasan status), let alone its authentication (Sahih status). Such as the hadith of Ibn Abbas warning against the bathhouse; he was truthful in his saying about it: \"And its narrators are all relied upon in the Sahih\", but it was hidden from him—and Allah knows best—that it is Anomalous (Shadh); due to its trustworthy narrator contradicting one who is more trustworthy than him, for he narrated it as Mursal. Similar is the hadith of Aisha: \"I adhered to the Siwak\", both are in (4 - Purification under number 127 and 147). The examples of this kind are very, very many. And one of the worst is his saying regarding the hadith of Tha'labah bin al-Hakam on the virtue of scholars (61): \"Its narrators are trustworthy\"! Yet it contains a narrator accused of fabrication! * And among that is that he does not distinguish what he prefaces of hadiths with his saying: (Ruwiya) between what is Weak, or Very Weak, or Fabricated, and between what is Anomalous (Shadh) or Denounced (Munkar); except rarely. So the readers do not know the rank of the hadith in reality, unless he follows it with something that indicates it from his explanation, and this is very rare.",

Contrary to what was intended of distinguishing between the Authentic and the Weak. * And in the introduction to the \"Sahih\"—from which I summarized the mentioned benefits—is a very important chapter, I can only transfer it here; due to its close connection to this book of ours, because it contains examples suitable for this introduction, and they may be supplements to some of the written benefits, so I apologize to the noble readers if they find it lengthy.

Whoever wishes to examine that may refer back to it.\n\nHowever, I must mention here some additional examples of the ignorance found in their edition, specifically concerning the hadiths of this book of ours, *Da'if at-Targhib*, in fulfillment of what I promised in the introduction to *Sahih at-Targhib*, in a style similar to what I presented there. So I say:\n\n1 – Their inability to verify the text and correct it by returning to the primary sources and classical usage of language—due to their ignorance of all of this. Examples include the word (yurabbithūn) in the hadith of ‘Ali regarding the encouragement to go early to the Friday prayer (7 – Jumu‘ah / 3 / under the first hadith). It is derived from *rabbatha–yurabbithu*, yet it was miswritten in the edition of those ignorant ones and in others as (tarayyatha). The explanation provided by the author is correct—and that alone is enough to teach the ignorant and awaken the heedless. See the following pages for further examples of this kind (pp. 77, 181, 187, 234, 239, 279, 316, 320, 333, and 335).\n\n2 – Their grading as “Hasan” the hadiths narrated by weak narrators, those who commit deception (mudallisin), and unknown narrators—and their inconsistency in doing so. This includes the hadiths of Shahr, Layth ibn Sulaym, Muhammad ibn Ishaq, and others, despite knowing…",

That is only due to ignorance and imitation. If they had said in the first of them: \"Hasan li-ghayrihi\" (Good due to external factors)—as they said in others—it would have been lighter! Similar is Hadith (145), they quoted Al-Haythami declaring it defective due to Tadlis (deception), and they accepted it, yet they classified it as Hasan!! Similar is Hadith (148)—and see the following hadiths with numbers: (363, 466, 484, 518, 528, 592—and it is fabricated—and 599 and 644). 3 - They sometimes classify as Hasan, and sometimes Authenticate (Sahih) the hadiths about which the author or Al-Haythami says: \"Its men are trustworthy\" or \"Its men are the men of the Sahih\", or even what he says about: \"Its men are documented\". This is from their extreme ignorance of the science of Hadith terminology, for that does not mean more than the fulfillment of one of the conditions of Authenticity or Goodness, as I had explained in the introduction to \"Sahih at-Targhib\", and I pointed out this ignorance of theirs in the introduction to the new edition of it. The examples of that are very many in this first volume, so how about their multitude in the other volumes; one of the worst is that they classified as Hasan the Fabricated Hadith coming in (7 - Friday / 1 Hadith 6) regarding Allah's forgiveness for all Muslims on Friday! And see Hadith number (26), and Hadiths (573, 578, 615, 616, and 635). And what confirms to you their mentioned ignorance is that they said regarding a hadith from those hadiths where Al-Haythami added nothing to documenting its men: \"And Al-Haythami authenticated it\"!

I mention here some examples, among them their saying regarding the hadith of Hudhayfah: \"Allah does not accept from an innovator a fast... he leaves Islam as a hair is pulled from dough\". They said: \"Hasan due to its supporting evidences\"! While it is Fabricated as I explained there number (43). Similar is the hadith of Umm Habiba regarding praying four rak'ahs before Asr (327). And similar to that is what will be alerted to under Hadiths (34, 131, 182, and 663), and many others. 5 - As for what they classified as Hasan or Sahih by itself; either by imitation or stumbling blindly; it is a frightening thing due to its quantity, and all of that with a stroke of a pen, without any commentary or direction. Based on what has become clear to me of their absolute ignorance, if it were said to them: \"Why did you classify it as Hasan or Sahih?\"; they would not be able to give an answer, or they would say: So-and-so classified it as Hasan, or so-and-so authenticated it! See for example numbers (7, 13, 26, 73, 80, 93, 117, 132, 145, 192, 214, 228, 259, 273, 300, 327, 339, 342, 343, 346, 363, 415, 426, 436, 453, 465, 473, 478, 565, 628, 635, and 637).

Even though this is also weak as you will see explained there, the ignorant ones included both in the improvement (Hasan classification), so they said: \"Hasan, narrated by At-Tirmidhi... from Abu Huraira... and from Ibn Umar\"!! 6 - And among that is that they come across the author's authentication of the hadith and the agreement of someone like Al-Haythami with him, so they contradict, and say: \"Hasan\"; without any explanation as is their habit. That is from their reservations which inform the researcher that they feel their ignorance of this science, so they take a middle path between those who authenticated and those who might have weakened or it is possible, while the reality is that they are mistaken in the classification of Hasan. An example is the coming narration from Ibn Mas'ud: that \"Whoever does not pay Zakat, there is no prayer for him\"! Number (465), and similar is number (655). 7 - And among that is that they mix with the Authentic hadith what is not authentic of it. See examples in numbers (208, 489, 501, 569, 583, and 642). 8 - And similar is their mixing between what is Weak of the hadith, and what is Very Weak, so they apply to both of them: \"Weak\"! And they may quote after it from the speech of some Huffaz what contradicts it, and the hadith might be Fabricated!! See if you wish some numbers: (114, 484, 586 - 587, 587 - 588, 615, 645, 664, 675, and 677). 9 - And from their banes is their blind imitation, which is not accompanied by any research or verification, which the most ignorant of people are not incapable of. The following pages point to some examples: (21, 38, 95, 108, 111, 119, 123, 126, 141, 227, 304, 310, 321, and 335).",

And they would have been truthful with themselves in their saying (page 21): \"And indeed our intense eagerness to extract the hadiths of the book and attribute them to their sources has benefited us greatly in arriving at the text of the book as the author intended, may Allah have mercy on him, or close to it, and getting rid of the misspellings of the scribes and their distortions\"! But the reality indicates—with deep regret—that they did not live up to the good opinion of them, and did not fulfill what they pledged. They did not benefit from the extraction, nor did they benefit the readers with anything of what they claimed of verification and arrival [at the correct text]... even though it is the easiest thing. For there occurred in their printed version very many errors and omissions in the texts of the hadiths and others, which are difficult to count and track. So let us be content with striking some examples confirming what I mentioned, and we refer in the rest of them which were facilitated for me to their numbers so that whoever wishes from the readers may return to them to get a general idea",

The other: A sentence was omitted from the end of the hadith of Uthman number (398) entirely, the size of a line, corrupting the meaning as well, even though they attributed it to \"Majma' az-Zawa'id\" and Ibn as-Sunni, with numbers also, and it is in both of them!!

So they pass with it to the seventh heaven. The angel entrusted with it says to them: Stop and strike the face of its owner with this deed, strike his limbs, and lock his heart. Indeed, I veil from my Lord every deed by which the Face of my Lord was not intended. Indeed, he intended by his deed other than Allah; he intended by it elevation among the jurists, mention among the scholars, and fame in the cities. My Lord commanded me not to let his deed pass me to another, and every deed that is not purely for Allah is showing off (Riya'), and Allah does not accept the deed of the one who shows off. He said: Then the recording angels ascend with the deed of the servant consisting of prayer, zakat, fasting, Hajj, Umrah, good character, silence, and remembrance of Allah the Exalted. The angels of the heavens accompany it until they cross all the veils to Allah, Mighty and Majestic. They stand before Him and testify for him regarding the righteous deed done sincerely for Allah. He said: So Allah says to them: You are the guardians over the deed of My servant, and I am the Watcher over his soul. Indeed, he did not intend Me with this deed, and he intended other than Me by it. So upon him is My curse. All the angels say: And upon him is Your curse and our curse. And all the heavens say: Upon him is the curse of Allah and our curse. And the seven heavens and whoever is in them curse him.",

Do not elevate yourself over them. Do not mix the work of the world with the work of the Hereafter. Do not be arrogant in your gathering so that people beware of your bad character. Do not whisper to a man while another is with you. Do not act grandiosely over people lest the good of the world and the Hereafter be cut off from you. Do not tear people apart (backbite), lest the dogs of the Fire tear you apart on the Day of Resurrection in the Fire. Allah the Exalted said: {And by those who pull out sharply (An-Nashitat)}. Do you know what they are, O Mu'adh?' I said: What are they, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you? He said: 'Dogs in the Fire that tear off flesh and bone.' I said: May my father and mother be sacrificed for you! Who can bear these traits, and who can be saved from them? He said: 'O Mu'adh! Indeed, it is easy for him whom Allah makes it easy.'

Perhaps the word (one hundred) fell from the mentioned narration. And Allah knows best.' I say: Its chain is weak, containing one who is unknown and another who has weakness. As I clarified in 'Ad-Da'ifah' (327 - Second Investigation). The word (one hundred) is also established in 'Ash-Shifa' by Qadi Iyad, and its investigators (!) attributed it (2/ 27) to At-Tabarani in 'Al-Awsat', without any note on the difference between the two narrations, and how many such illusions they have! Among them is that they attributed the addition \"and every misguidance is in the Fire\" in the Sahih hadith of Jabir to Muslim! Yet it is not with him, rather it is with An-Nasa'i and Al-Bayhaqi! As will come here in the other book 'Sahih At-Targhib'.\n2. With dotted Zai and Kha, meaning: pushed. In all copies of the book, including the Zahiriyyah copy (13/ 2), it is with the word: 'Zujj' with Zai and Jim, which is an error.

It appears this error is from the author, may Allah have mercy on him, as it is among what Sheikh An-Naji criticized him for, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him.\n3.

It is also in Ibn Abi Asim in 'As-Sunnah' (No. 42 - My verification), and Ibn Wahb narrated it in his 'Musnad' (8/ 166/ 2), and from him Ibn Waddah in 'Al-Bida' (p. 38), and Ishaq Ar-Ramli in 'Hadith Adam' (2/ 2), and Al-Baghawi in 'Sharh As-Sunnah' (No. 110 - Islamic Office edition) without the mentioned word. Perhaps this difference is from Kathir bin Abdullah Al-Muzani - its narrator - for he is very weak; indeed Abu Dawud and others called him a liar, even if some considered the correctness of that unlikely, with an argument weaker than a spider's web, there is no space now to clarify and refute it.\n3. I say: Meaning Hasan due to external evidence (Li-Ghayrihi), for in it is an indication from him of his weakening of its chain as he explained in a rule of his in his 'Ilal'. So the saying of some: 'It is questionable' is only from a lack of insight into this science. Yes, his mentioned grading of Hasan is rejected from its foundation; firstly due to the severity of the weakness of its narrator, and secondly because its text contains what has no witness, which is his saying: 'misleading innovation, that does not please Allah and His Messenger'. Therefore, some innovators clung to it and deduced from its implication that there is in Islam a 'good innovation' that pleases Allah and His Messenger! So it is said to him: Prove the Throne then sculpt (prove the basis first). And the witnesses which the author, may Allah have mercy on him, pointed to do not contain this sentence, as you will see in the upcoming chapter from 'As-Sahih'. Furthermore, the documentation of this hadith was distorted by the five investigators (!) of 'Ash-Shifa', so they said (2/ 28): 'Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah graded it Hasan'! This indicates their extreme ignorance of this art; for beginners in it do not miss that Ibn Majah is not in the habit of discussing the hadith and grading it Hasan! As for their obliviousness to its defect, it is fitting for one who claims verification without having knowledge of it.\n4.

And Allah knows best. 1 - (Chapter) 47 - (4) [Fabricated] And from Mu'adh bin Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: 'Learn knowledge; for indeed learning it for Allah is fear (Khashyah), seeking it is worship, [revising it] (*) is Tasbih, researching it is Jihad, teaching it to one who does not know it is charity, and spending it for its people is nearness (to Allah). Because it is the signpost of the lawful and the prohibited, the lighthouse of the paths of the people of Paradise. It is the companion in loneliness, the friend in estrangement, the conversationalist in seclusion, the guide in prosperity and adversity, the weapon against enemies, and the adornment among friends. Allah raises peoples by it and makes them leaders and imams (1) in good whose footsteps are traced, whose deeds are emulated, and whose opinions are referred to. The angels desire their friendship (2), and wipe them with their wings. Every wet and dry thing seeks forgiveness for them, even the fish of the sea and its vermin, and the beasts of the land and its cattle. Because knowledge is the life of hearts from ignorance, and the lamps of the eyes from darkness. The servant reaches by knowledge the stations of the righteous and the high degrees in the world and the Hereafter. Thinking about it is equivalent to fasting, and studying it is equivalent to standing (in prayer). By it ties of kinship are joined, and by it the lawful is known from the prohibited. It is the leader of action, and action is its follower. The happy ones are inspired with it, and the wretched ones are deprived of it.'",

Therefore, Al-Hafiz An-Naji critiqued it, and spoke at length clarifying the paths of the hadith and its wordings and their extraction (83 - 87).

And by his recitation, he drives away from his house and the houses around him the immoral Jinn and the rebellious devils. Indeed, the house in which the Quran is recited has a tent of light over it; the inhabitants of the heaven are guided by it just as one is guided by a shining star in the depths of the seas and in the barren land. When the companion of the Quran dies, that tent is raised. The angels look from the sky and do not see that light, so the angels receive him from heaven to heaven, and the angels pray for his soul among the souls. Then the guardian angels who were with him receive him, then the angels seek forgiveness for him until the Day of Resurrection. There is no man who learns the Book of Allah, then prays for an hour of the night, except that that past night advises the coming night to wake him for his hour, and to be light upon him. When he dies and his family is busy with his funeral preparation, the Quran comes in a handsome, beautiful form and stands at his head until he is wrapped in his shrouds; the Quran is then on his chest inside the shroud. When he is placed in his grave and covered, and his companions leave him, Munkar and Nakir come to him and make him sit in his grave. The Quran comes until it is between him and them. They say to it: 'Step aside so we can question him.' It says: 'No, by the Lord of the Kaaba! He is my companion and my close friend, and I will not forsake him in any condition. If you were commanded with something, proceed to what you were commanded and leave me in my place, for I will not leave him until I enter him into Paradise.' Then the Quran looks at its companion and says: 'I am the Quran which you used to recite aloud and recite silently, and you used to love me, so I am your beloved. And whoever I love, Allah loves him. After the questioning of Munkar and Nakir, you will have no worry nor grief.' So Munkar and Nakir question him and ascend. He and the Quran remain. It says: 'I will surely spread for you a soft bed, and I will surely cover you with a handsome, beautiful cover, for how you stayed awake for me during your night and exhausted yourself during your day.' -He said:- So the Quran ascends to the heaven faster than a glance, and asks Allah for that for him, so He gives it",

I have not ceased, since I left you, to speak to Allah the Blessed and Exalted until I took for you a bed, a cover, and a key, and I have come to you with it. So stand so the angels may spread it for you.' He said: 'So the angels raise him up gently, then his grave is expanded for him the distance of four hundred years. Then a bed is placed for him whose lining is green silk filled with musk of the finest scent. Pillows of Sundus and Istabraq (silk brocade) are placed at his feet and head. Two lamps of the light of Paradise are lit for him at his head and feet, shining until the Day of Resurrection. Then the angels lay him on his right side facing the Qibla. Then jasmine of Paradise is brought, and they ascend from him. He remains, he and the Quran. The Quran takes the jasmine and places it on his nose fresh, so he inhales it until he is resurrected. The Quran returns to his family and informs them (1) [of his news] every day and night, and checks on them as a compassionate father checks on his child with good. If anyone of his children learns the Quran, he gives him glad tidings of that. And if his offspring are bad offspring, he supplicates for their rectification and turning [to Allah], or as he mentioned.\"' Narrated by Al-Bazzar and he said: \"Khalid bin Ma'dan did not hear from Mu'adh.

When he arrived, he embraced him and kissed between his eyes, then said: \"Shall I not grant you? Shall I not delight you? Shall I not give you?\" So he mentioned the hadith (1). Then he said: \"This is an authentic chain with no dust on it.\" (The Dictator said) Al-Hafiz, may Allah be pleased with him: \"And his sheikh Ahmad bin Dawud bin Abd al-Ghaffar Abu Salih Al-Harrani then Al-Masri; more than one of the Imams spoke about him, and Ad-Daraqutni called him a liar (2).\"",
    "foot_note": "1. This gives the illusion that the context of the hadith is like the one mentioned in \"As-Sahih\" because in the original it is before it, but the reality is contrary. For he added after (Allahu Akbar): \"And there is no change nor power except by Allah.\" And he did not mention the Tasbihs after the Ruku! \n2. An-Naji said (99): \"This is strange from him, as he imagined that this man who is spoken against is the sheikh of Al-Hakim, while he is the sheikh of his sheikh without doubt. But he inadvertently omitted Al-Hakim's sheikh Abu Ali Al-Husayn bin Ali, who is established in the narration itself, and that he informed him by dictation from the original of his book. So it is an error arising from an omission.\" I say: And indeed he spoke the truth, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him. The Three Ignorant Ones overlooked this omission, so they benefited nothing from the alert of Sheikh An-Naji, even though he is one of their references! His chain in \"Al-Mustadrak\" (1/ 319) is: Abu Ali Al-Husayn bin Ali Al-Hafiz told us—dictating from the original of his book—: Ahmad bin Dawud bin Abd al-Ghaffar told us—in Egypt—... etc. It is strange that Adh-Dhahabi in his \"Talkhis\" agreed with him on authenticating it! While he is the one who said about this Ahmad in \"Al-Mizan\": \"Ad-Daraqutni and others called him a liar, and from his lies...\", then he cited two hadiths for him, saying about one: \"Lie\", and the other: \"Fabricated\". And he pointed to another hadith of his and described it as a lie also. See \"Ad-Da'ifah\" (2066). I say: It is strange that this error was repeated by the author in another hadith which will come in (23 - Manners / 3).",

He said: He says Takbir then says: (Glory be to You O Allah and with Your praise, blessed is Your name, exalted is Your majesty, and there is no deity other than You). Then he says fifteen times 15: (Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no deity except Allah, and Allah is the Greatest). Then he seeks refuge and reads: {In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful}, and {The Opening of the Book} and a Surah. Then he says ten times 25: (Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no deity except Allah, and Allah is the Greatest). Then he bows and says it ten times 35. Then he raises his head and says it ten times 45. Then he prostrates and says it ten times 55. Then he raises his head and says it ten times 65. Then he prostrates the second time and says it ten times 75. He prays four rak'ahs like this. That is seventy-five Tasbihs in every rak'ah. He starts in every rak'ah with fifteen Tasbihs, then reads, then glorifies ten times. If he prays at night, I prefer that he makes Taslim in every two rak'ahs. If he prays by day, if he wishes he makes Taslim, and if he wishes he does not make Taslim. Abu Wahb said: Abdul Aziz—he is Ibn Abi Rizmah—informed me from Abdullah; that he said: He starts in the Ruku with (Glory be to my Lord the Great), and in the Sujud with (Glory be to my Lord the Most High) (three times), then he glorifies the Tasbihs.

It is strange that the likes of Al-Hakim, Al-Bayhaqi, Al-Wahidi and those after them relied on experimentation in a matter they all know includes opposing the pure Sunnah, and falling into its prohibitions.\" \n1. Thus in the original and others, and the three ignorant ones proceeded upon it! The correct is Abu Bakr bin Ayyash, and finding fault with him is a gross negligence, for it contains one who fabricates Hadith. The three commentators were oblivious to all of this! They blundered and said: \"Weak\", and hid as is their habit and did not clarify, while what is in the book, if authentic, would require grading it Hasan at least! As is not hidden from the knowledgeable. The clarification is in \"Ad-Da'ifah\" (5298).",

Whoever draws near in it with a characteristic, is like one who performed an obligation in other than it. And whoever performs an obligation in it is like one who performed seventy obligations in other than it. It is the month of patience, and the reward of patience is Paradise. And the month of consolation, and a month in which the believer's provision is increased. Whoever breaks the fast of a fasting person in it, it will be forgiveness for his sins, and freeing of his neck from the Fire, and he will have the like of his reward without decreasing anything from his reward.\" They said: O Messenger of Allah! Not all of us find what to break the fasting person's fast with? So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: \"Allah gives this reward to one who breaks the fast of a fasting person on a date, or a drink of water, or a sip of milk (1). It is a month whose beginning is mercy, its middle is forgiveness, and its end is freedom from the Fire. Whoever lightens the burden of his slave in it, Allah forgives him and frees him from the Fire. So increase in it four characteristics: two characteristics by which you please your Lord, and two characteristics you cannot do without. As for the two characteristics by which you please your Lord, they are the testimony that there is no deity except Allah and you seek His forgiveness. As for the two characteristics you cannot do without, you ask Allah for Paradise, and seek refuge in Him from the Fire. And whoever gives water (2) to a fasting person, Allah will give him a drink from my Basin, a drink after which he will not thirst (3) until he enters Paradise.\" Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his \"Sahih\", then he said: \"If the report is authentic.\" And Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from his path.

Al-Asbahani narrated it in \"At-Targhib\" from another path from Umar bin Harun Al-Balkhi from Thawr bin Yazid with it. This Al-Balkhi is a liar, so it is feared that Baqiyyah narrated it from him and then obfuscated (did Tadlis). See \"Ad-Da'ifah\" (521 and 5163).

And Allah knows best. I say: This is an error, for the Hadith was never narrated by Ahmad with this completeness, rather he narrated the Marfu' part of it only as the author will clarify. So the unique copy is not reliable, especially with its contradiction to all copies, including the Zahiriyyah manuscript (folio 140/ 2), in which it is: \"Narrated with a Sahih chain\", thus he did not mention the narrator. For that reason, An-Naji said in \"Al-Ujalah\" (folio 135/ 1): \"Thus in all copies, and he intended: Al-Khatib in his \"Tarikh\", but what you see intervened between this and what he mentioned, so ambiguity and doubt occurred.\" I say: He remained silent about his saying: \"with a Sahih chain\", and that is an illusion from both of them. How so when it is from the narration of Suwaid bin Sa'id as you see, and he is weak. Al-Hafiz said: \"Truthful in himself, except that he became blind and started accepting what was not from his Hadith, and Ibn Ma'in spoke harshly about him.\" Despite this, the three graded it Hasan! But the Marfu' part of it is established; because it came from another path as you see in the book.

When he entered morning he prayed the Fajr prayer with the people, then the people rode. When the sun rose the people became drowsy following the night journey (Duljah), and Mu'adh stuck to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) following his trace, while the people's mounts scattered on the middle of the road; eating and walking. While Mu'adh was on the trace of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and his she-camel eating once and walking another, Mu'adh's she-camel stumbled, so he reined it in (2) with the rein, so it bolted until the she-camel of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) shied away from it. Then the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) removed his veil from himself, and looked around and behold there was no one in the army closer to him than Mu'adh.

The people became drowsy so their mounts scattered grazing and walking.

Permit me to ask you about a word that has sickened me, made me ill, and grieved me. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"Ask whatever you wish.\" He said: O Prophet of Allah! Tell me of a deed that will enter me into Paradise, I do not ask you about anything else. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: \"Bakh, Bakh, Bakh (Expression of approval/wonder), you have indeed asked about a great thing, you have asked about a great thing, you have asked about a great thing, (three times), and it is indeed easy for whom Allah wills good for him, and it is easy for whom Allah wills good for him, and it is easy for whom Allah wills good for him.\" He did not tell him a thing, except that he repeated it three times, out of eagerness so that he would master it from him. The Prophet of Allah (PBUH) said: \"Believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish prayer, give Zakat, and worship Allah alone associating nothing with Him; until you die while you are upon that.\" He said: O Messenger of Allah!

And that the pillar of this matter is establishing prayer, and giving Zakat. And that the peak of the hump of it is Jihad in the path of Allah.

Al-Haythami said likewise, but it is disconnected (Munqati'), for in Ahmad (3/ 78 and 84) it is from the path of Bakr Al-Muzani, and they did not mention any narration for him from Abu Sa'id. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in \"As-Sunan\" (2/ 320) from him saying: An informant informed me from Abu Sa'id. So the chain goes back to an unknown informant. For such reasons we say: The statement of Al-Hafiz: \"its narrators are narrators of As-Sahih\" does not imply authenticity. Due to the ignorance of the three [commentators] about this, they said cautiously - as is their habit -: \"Hasan\"!",

It and the first narration are both in \"Mu'jam At-Tabarani Al-Awsat\"; contrary to what the author's absolute attribution of them to At-Tabarani implies. And his saying: \"their narrators' Hadith is Hasan\", is not so as I verified in \"Ad-Da'ifah\" number (4348). \n2. Thus in the original matching the Zahiriyyah manuscript. Al-Haythami attributed the first narration to At-Tabarani in \"Al-Kabir\" and \"Al-Awsat\", and likewise he attributed this one to them. Perhaps the phrase \"in Al-Kabir and Al-Awsat\" was dropped from the pen of the author or the copyist in the first one. By that, the dual pronoun referring to them would be correct. But I doubt greatly the existence of this other narration in \"Al-Awsat\", after searching for it therein, and Al-Haythami did not attribute it to him in \"Majma' Al-Bahrain\" (7/ 319 - 320), except the first narration. This one is in two places therein (6731 and 6818) and from one weak path. And Allah knows best. It is documented in \"Ad-Da'ifah\" (5119). \n3.

Al-Haythami disagreed with him in \"Majma' Al-Bahrain\" and held that she is the mother of Anas. And that is apparent.

Al-Bayhaqi narrated it with two chains (1), one of them is Jayyid. 911 - (18) [Fabricated] And it was narrated from Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: \"Whoever does not remember Allah much; has absolved himself of faith.\" Narrated by At-Tabarani in \"Al-Awsat\" and \"As-Saghir\", and it is a Gharib Hadith (2). 912 - (19) [Very Weak] And it was narrated from him also from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, who said: \"Indeed Allah says: O son of Adam! If you remember Me you have thanked Me, and if you forget Me you have disbelieved Me.\" Narrated by At-Tabarani in \"Al-Awsat\". 913 - (20) [Very Weak] And from Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her; that she heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, say: \"There is no hour that passes by the son of Adam in which he does not remember Allah with good; except that he regrets it on the Day of Resurrection.\" Narrated by Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya, and Al-Bayhaqi, and he said: \"There is weakness in this chain; however, it has a witness (3) from the aforementioned Hadith of Mu'adh.\"",

The denounced part of the Hadith is what is other than the first sentence, for it has been authenticated from him, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, from several paths as I mentioned there.\n2. I say: It contains an unknown narrator, which is an apparent defect, so I do not know how this aligns with his prefacing the Hadith with the form (An - From) which implies its strength, especially since the sentence about the slaves is denounced. The ruling on the rest of it is as we said regarding the one before it. From the ignorance of the three commentators and their contradiction is that they prefaced the Hadith with weakening, then said: \"And its text has witnesses, see it in (Jala' Al-Afham)\"! And in their last statement is deception (Tadlis) implying that it contains witnesses, while there is nothing but the Hadith with its chain, without any word about it from its author, may Allah have mercy on him!

Whoever sends blessings upon me every day three times, and every night three times; out of love or longing for me; it is a right upon Allah to forgive him his sins of that night and that day.\" Narrated by Ibn Abi Asim, and At-Tabarani in a long Hadith; except that he said: \"It is a right upon Allah to forgive him for every time the sins of a year\" (3).",
    "foot_note": "1. Thus he said, and Al-Haythami found fault with it saying: \"And it contains a narrator whom I did not know,\" and he was not correct. The defect is Abu Ja'far Ar-Razi who has poor memory, and he contradicted the authentic Ahadith agreed upon \"Allah sends blessings upon him ten times\", so he said on the tongue of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him: \"I send blessings upon him ten times\", so it is also denounced. It is documented in \"Ad-Da'ifah\" (5141), and from here appears the error of As-Sakhawi in following (p. 78) Al-Mundhiri in grading it Hasan.\n2. I say: Meaning in his book \"At-Targhib\" (folio 261/ 2), and it contains a weak narrator and another who is not trustworthy. Its explanation is in \"Ad-Da'ifah\" (5110), and Al-Hafiz Al-Asqalani and As-Sakhawi denounced it.\n3. This is an error from the author, may Allah have mercy on him, pointed out by An-Naji, may Allah have mercy on him. For At-Tabarani's narration regarding sending blessings upon the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, is like the narration of Ibn Abi Asim (48 - 49). As for the one he attributed to At-Tabarani, it is in another sentence which the author's sight skipped to, and it is after the sentence of (Prayer). Its text in \"Mu'jam At-Tabarani Al-Kabir\" (18/ 361 - 362/ 928) is: \"Know, O Abu Kahil! That whoever testifies that there is no deity but Allah alone with certainty in it, it is a right upon Allah to forgive with every time (Original: once) the sins of a year.\" And likewise in \"Majma' Az-Zawa'id\" (4/ 218 - 219), and he mentioned from Adh-Dhahabi that its chain is dark. The author mentioned the Hadith completely at the end of his book (24 - Repentance / 9 - Encouragement for Fear), and there is also an omission in it which I rectified there. Furthermore, Al-Uqayli also weakened the Hadith, and it is documented in \"As-Sahihah\", under Hadith (2652). Ibn Abd Al-Barr pointed to it in the biography of Abu Kahil in \"Al-Isti'ab\" and said: \"It is a Munkar Hadith.\" And Al-Jazari confirmed it in \"Usud Al-Ghabah\".",

He said: \"His tyranny and his injustice. And no servant earns haram wealth and gives charity from it and it is accepted from him, nor does he spend from it and is blessed in it, nor does he leave it behind his back except that it is his provision to the Fire.

Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: \"Are you better today or when a bowl of bread and meat is brought to one of you in the morning, and another is brought in the evening, and he goes out in a suit and returns in another, and you cover your houses as the Kaaba is covered?\" We said: Rather we are better on that day; we devote ourselves to worship. He said: \"Rather you are better today\" (2). Narrated by Abu Ya'la and the wording is his. And At-Tirmidhi narrated it; except that he said: I went out on a winter day from the house of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace; and I had taken a tanned (ma'tun) (3) hide and cut a hole in its center, put it around my neck, and tied my waist with palm fiber, and I was severely hungry, so he mentioned the hadith, and did not mention the story of Mus'ab bin Umair in it, but mentioned his story in another place separately, and said in each of them: \"A Hasan Gharib hadith\".

As for Sheikh Shu'aib's strengthening of it in the footnote of \"At-Tahdhib\" (2/ 160) with some witnesses, it is negligence from him of what I mentioned, and of the fact that the witnesses are deficient witnesses which would take long to explain. It suffices now that the sentence \"And whoever gives it to a child...\" was not mentioned in them, rather it is Munkar as some Huffaz said, and the Three imitated them so they said: \"Hasan due to its witnesses\"!! It is extracted in \"Ad-Da'ifah\" (6328). \n2. I say: How so when it contains (Shahr bin Hawshab), and he is weak, and he was confused in its chain. Once he narrated it like this from Asma (6/ 460), and once he said: From a cousin of Abu Dharr, from Abu Dharr similarly, and it does not contain the sentence \"dies a disbeliever\". Narrated by Ahmad (5/ 171) and Al-Bazzar (3/ 353)?! And the hadith without it is authentic, it has witnesses in the chapter you can see in \"As-Sahih\". \n3. I say: This is furthest from the truth, for I explained earlier that it is from the narration of Shahr from a cousin of Abu Dharr, so it contains weakness and ignorance, and Al-Haythami faulted it with that. Then it does not contain: \"dies a disbeliever\" as in the first. And the Ignorant Ones did not differentiate between the two narrations - as is their habit - so they said: \"Hasan, narrated by Ahmad..\"!!",

As for this one, he weakened it by saying: \"Hanash - meaning the one in its chain - is weak according to the scholars of Hadith.\" Al-Hafiz said: \"Matruk (abandoned)\", and it is in \"Ad-Da'ifah\" number (5343). It seems the reason is that the author's gaze moved after quoting the hadith of Ibn Abbas from (At-Tirmidhi) to the hadith of Sahl which follows it in his book, so he transferred his comment authenticating it to the hadith of Ibn Abbas!",

And Adh-Dhahabi rejected it by saying: \"I say: Az-Zanji is weak.\" Al-Hafiz said: \"Truthful but has many delusions.\" So the classification of 'Hasan' by the commentator on \"Musnad Abu Ya'la\" (11/334) is rejected, especially since it was narrated as Mawquf on Umar, and the author said: \"And perhaps that is more likely.\" Al-Bayhaqi's authentication of it is questionable to me, because he narrated it in his \"Sunan\" (10/195) via Ash-Sha'bi: I heard Ziyad bin Hudair say: I heard Umar say: then he mentioned it; but it contains (Musa bin Dawud), who is At-Tarsusi, and there is weakness in his memory. Adh-Dhahabi said in \"Al-Mughni\": \"He was authenticated, and Abu Hatim said: There is confusion in his hadith.\" And he narrated it in \"Ash-Shu'ab\" (4/160/4658) via another path from Ash-Sha'bi who said: Umar said. This is disconnected; Ash-Sha'bi did not meet Umar. However, his chain to Ash-Sha'bi is authentic. Perhaps Al-Bayhaqi indicated its lack of confirmation from Umar by saying after the hadith in \"As-Sunan\" (7/136): \"And something similar was narrated from Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) from his own speech. And Allah knows best.\" \n2. I say: Sheikh An-Naji corrected him saying (193/2): \"Thus Ibn Majah narrated it briefly.\" I say: Its chain contains a weak narrator and another unknown one. And in Ibn Hibban's chain is a liar. It is documented in \"Ad-Da'ifah\" (1910); so it is strange how the author prefaced it with (An - from) indicating its strengthening!",

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Indeed I know a word, if he said it, what he finds of anger would go away from him.\" He said: What is it, O Messenger of Allah?

Mu'adh died in the caliphate of Umar bin Al-Khattab, and Umar bin Al-Khattab was killed while Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila was a boy of six years.\" What At-Tirmidhi said is clear; for Al-Bukhari mentioned what indicates that the birth of Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila was in the year seventeen, and more than one stated that Mu'adh bin Jabal died in the plague of Amwas in the year eighteen, and it was said year seventeen. An-Nasa'i (2) narrated this hadith from Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila from Ubayy bin Ka'b. And this is connected.

He pulled it, cut it, and threw it away, then said: The family of Abdullah has become rich beyond Shirk.

The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: \"By the One in whose hand is my soul; when they emerge from their graves they are met with white she-camels, having wings, upon them are saddles of gold. The straps of their sandals are light that glimmers. Every step of them is as far as the eye can see. They arrive at the gate of Paradise, and there is a ring of red ruby on plates of gold. And there is a tree at the gate of Paradise from whose root two springs flow. If they drink from one of them, the freshness of bliss flows in their faces. And if they perform ablution from the other, their hair never becomes disheveled. They strike the ring with the plate. If you were to hear the ringing of the ring, O Ali! It reaches every Hoori that her husband has arrived. So haste seizes her, and she sends her warden (Qayyim) to open the door for him. Were it not that Allah Almighty made him know himself; he would have prostrated to him due to what he sees of light and splendor. He says: I am your warden who has been appointed to your command. So he follows him and traces his path until he comes to his wife. Haste seizes her, so she comes out of the tent and embraces him, saying: You are my love and I am your love. I am the pleased one so I will never be angry. I am the comfortable one so I will never be miserable. I am the eternal one so I will never depart. He enters a house from its foundation to its ceiling is a hundred thousand cubits, built on stones of pearls and rubies. Red paths, green paths, and yellow paths. No path among them resembles its companion. He comes to the couch (Arikah) and there is a bed on it. On the bed are seventy mattresses. On every mattress are seventy wives. On every wife are seventy garments. The marrow of her leg is seen from inside the garments. Their intercourse is completed in the amount of a night. Rivers flow beneath them",

And he has three hundred servants, and every morning and evening three hundred bowls are brought to him - and I do not know but he said: of gold - in every bowl is a color not in the other. He finds pleasure in the first of it as he finds pleasure in the last of it. And from drinks, three hundred vessels, in every vessel is a color not in the other. He finds pleasure in the first of it as he finds pleasure in the last of it. And he says: O Lord! If You permitted me, I would feed the people of Paradise and give them drink, and nothing of what I have would decrease. And he has from the Hoor al-Ayn seventy-two wives, besides his wives from the world. And the seat of one of them takes the space of a mile.\" Narrated by Ahmad from Shahr from him.

And they are given in Paradise horses, saddled and bridled, that do not defecate or urinate. They ride them until they end up where Allah Almighty wills. Then a cloud-like thing comes to them containing what no eye has seen nor ear heard. They say: Rain upon us. So the rain continues upon them until that ends above their hopes. Then Allah sends a wind, not harmful, which scatters dunes of musk from their right and their left. That musk takes to the forelocks of their horses, their manes, and their heads. Every man among them has a lock of hair (Jummah) as his soul desires. That musk clings to those locks, the horses, and other clothes. Then they proceed until they end up at what Allah wills. Behold, a woman calls one of them: O servant of Allah! Do you not have a need for us? He says: What are you, and who are you? She says: I am your wife and your love. He says: I did not know of your place. The woman says: Do you not know that Allah Almighty said: {And no soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort for eyes as reward for what they used to do}? He says: Yes, by my Lord!

They raise their heads, and behold, the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, has looked upon them and says: 'O people of Paradise! Ask Me.' They say: 'We ask You for Your pleasure with us.'

He says: 'So they are brought mounts (Naj'aib) of red ruby, their reins are of green emerald and red ruby. They are carried upon them, placing their hooves at the limit of their sight. Allah Almighty orders trees bearing fruit, so maidens from the Hoor al-Ayn come, saying: We are the comfortable ones and will never be miserable, we are the eternal ones and will never die, wives of noble believing people. And Allah Almighty orders dunes of white, fragrant musk, and scatters upon them a wind called: Al-Muthira (The Stirrer), until it ends with them at the Garden of Eden, and it is the center (Qasabah) of Paradise (1). The angels say: 'O our Lord! The people have come.' He says: 'Welcome to the truthful, welcome to the obedient.' He says: 'Then the Veil is lifted for them, and they look at Allah, Blessed and Exalted. They enjoy the Light of the Most Merciful so much that they do not look at one another. Then He says: Return them to the palaces with the gifts. So they return, having seen one another.'\" The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: \"That is His saying: {An accommodation from [One who is] Forgiving and Merciful} [Fussilat: 32].\" Narrated by Abu Nu'aym and Al-Bayhaqi, and the wording is his (2), and he said:",

What is this?' He said: 'This is the world, its clarity and its beauty.' - He said: - I said: 'And what is this black spot in its center?' He said: 'This is Friday (Jumu'ah).'

Go out to the Abode of Increase (Dar al-Mazid); no one knows its breadth, width, and length except Allah Almighty.' So they go out onto dunes of musk - Hudhayfah said: - And it is indeed whiter than this flour of yours. - He said: - Then the servants of the Prophets come out with pulpits of light, and the servants of the believers come out with chairs of ruby. - He said: - When they are placed for them and the people take their seats, Allah Blessed and Exalted sends upon them a wind called Al-Muthira (The Stirrer), which stirs up upon them heaps of white musk, inserting it under their clothes and bringing it out onto their faces and hair. That wind knows better how to apply that musk than a woman among you if that perfume were given to her by the permission of Allah. - He said: - [Then Allah Glorified reveals to the bearers of the Throne, so He is placed in the midst of Paradise, and between Him and them are veils. The first thing they hear from Him is that] He says: 'Where are My servants who obeyed Me in the unseen, and did not see Me, and believed My Messengers and followed My command?

In this one, there are additions not present in that one, the most important being the additions indicated in brackets. Also, that one does not contain the phrase: \"that perfume by the permission of Allah,\" but rather \"the perfume of the people of the world.\" For verification, I referred to Ibn Al-Qayyim's book: \"Hadi Al-Arwah\", and I found that he cited the Hadith at length (2/ 123-126) with the chain of Ibn Battah and the chain of Al-Bazzar. upon comparing his citation with that of Al-Bazzar, it became clear to me that this is Ibn Battah's, and that it is the author's context, so he should have attributed it to Ibn Battah as well. Furthermore, in our printed original of \"At-Targhib\" there were some errors - perhaps typographical - which I corrected from \"Al-Hadi\", the most important being the addition of a full line between the words: \"a woman among you if given to her\" and the words: \"that perfume\". So I deleted it. As for the three ignorant ones, they are in a valley [of confusion], and the verification they claimed is in another valley, and some of what has been noted previously is sufficient to convict them, and to show that they speak of what they do not know.",
