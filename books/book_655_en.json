    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nAuthor's Introduction\n\nPraise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and the [good] end is for the righteous, and there is no aggression except against the wrongdoers. Prayers and peace be upon the best of His creation, our master Muhammad, and upon all his family and companions, and their followers among the drawn-near allies (Awliya), and the people of Your obedience whom You have chosen over many of Your believing servants, and singled them out for nearness to Your Presence, and acquainted them with some of Your knowledge, and honored them with Tawhid (Monotheism), obedience, guidance, and success. You made them successors to Your prophets in miracles, and manifested through them karamat (miraculous gifts) to the creation. You established them to bear the tribulations that descend upon creation from the heavens; so they are patient in bearing them, complying with what You established them in, satisfied with You, and rectifying their regions. They judge for the interests of the servants by Your command, following the path of reality (Haqiqah). The people of knowledge follow their sayings and deeds for the Sharia (Divine Law), and emulate them. They are the light of the world and its lamps; no one walks a path except by the light of those lamps. Through them we are guided, their path we emulate, and by their secret we seek rain. They are circling in all regions of the earth, witnessing the Divine Presence, and by the permission of their Lord, removing distress from the servants. Each of them has a rank he upholds by the permission of the Lord of the Worlds. They are persistent in these states, not heedless of the remembrance of Allah Almighty, famous by the secret, elevated above creation in the knowledge of Tawhid and the knowledge of Haqiqah. Their hearts and limbs are filled with faith, varying in faith according to their ranks in the stations of nearness.\n\n\"Types of Tawhid and Divisions of Guidance\"\n\nTypes of Tawhid\nThe types of Tawhid are three: Knowing that Allah Almighty is unique in planning, influence, and the Tawhid of Dominion, and His uniqueness, Glory be to Him, in complete sovereignty and general governance.\nTawhid of Divinity (Uluhiyyah) is through three matters:\nFirst: That He be deified such that majesty and love take over the heart so that no room remains in it for other than Him.\nSecond: That one does not resort in needs, for repelling harm or bringing benefit, except to Him.\nThird: That one hastens to His answers and what pleases Him.\n\nThe divisions of Guidance are also three:\nThe first meaning: The creation of Tawhid in the heart, which is the knowledge of Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty created three things in the heart:\n1. The light of knowledge (Ma'rifah).\n2. The light of love.\n3. The light of intellect.\n\nSecond: From the divisions of guidance: Guidance meaning persistence in faith and steadfastness upon it. From this is the saying of the monotheist: (Guide us to the straight path), meaning grant us persistence upon it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to frequently say: \"O Turner of hearts, make my heart steadfast on Your religion.\" And among his supplications was: \"O Director of hearts, direct our hearts to Your obedience.\" The difference between this and the first is: In the first, he asks for persistence and steadfastness on faith, and in the second, he asks that He directs his heart to His obedience. In it is a reference to Tawfiq (success granted by Allah), which is assistance in performing what Allah Almighty commanded and abandoning what He forbade. Tawfiq is the servant's performance of obedience according to what his Lord commanded. If he performs it in accordance with His command, then Tawfiq has occurred. Whenever he falls short, exceeds, or abandons an action, he has missed Tawfiq.\nSince faith is not achieved except through Allah Almighty, Allah created in the servant's heart the light of love for faith, because love binds the beloved, for whoever loves something holds onto it. And since the beloved needs someone to protect it from his whispers and defend it from enemies—who are the devils from mankind and jinn calling to disbelief and worship of other than Allah Almighty—Allah Almighty gave the servant the light of intellect, which is the third of the lights, to protect the faith He made beloved to him and the blessings Allah Almighty bestowed upon us, which are: the light of knowledge, the light of love, and the light of intellect. These were mentioned previously, and Allah Almighty mentioned them in Surah Al-Hujurat.\nThe reference to the light of knowledge is in His saying: (And know that among you is the Messenger of Allah), wherein is the command to know the Messenger and the Sender.\nHis saying: (But Allah has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts) is a reference to the light of binding love.\nAnd His saying: (And has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance, and disobedience) is a reference to the light of intellect. By this, the whispering of the servant and diseases of the heart such as oppression, envy, arrogance, hatred, mockery, backbiting, gossip, and others are repelled. By the light of intellect, the whispering of Satan and all innovations are repelled. By the light of intellect, faith is protected from what disputes with it and confuses it from the disturbances that drag one to disbelief, sins, and following desires. It has been said: Sins are the courier of disbelief, and whoever follows desires has planted the tree of regrets in his heart.",

    "text": "The third division of Guidance: That it is in the meaning of clarification (Bayan). Allah Almighty said: (And indeed, you guide to a straight path). The intent here regarding the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is the clarification that leads to believing the truth as truth and falsehood as falsehood.\nKnow that the first two divisions do not occur from other than Allah Almighty. The Guide is Allah: Allah Almighty said: (Indeed, you do not guide whom you like), meaning you do not create guidance in the heart of one from whom it is veiled, but Allah guides whom He wills. O Allah, guide us among those You have guided. End of the Sheikh's speech.\n\nChapter\nOn the Prohibition of Sitting with Young Boys and Women, Consorting with them, and Looking at them\n\nAllah Almighty said: (Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts).\n\nThe Eye is the Head of the Senses bringing thoughts:\nAl-Qurtubi said in *Al-Gharib al-Muntaqa*: Know that the head of your senses bringing thoughts to you, which almost indicates you without speech, expresses your intention without words, and almost leads the rest of the limbs of your body, is the sense of sight. Its position in the body is like the position of the sun in the world. It is the sense that perceives its object instantly without time; I mean that its perception of what is near is as fast as its perception of what is far, and there is no time between its near and far perception. The rest of the senses perceive with time, and perception ceases with the absence of the perceived object. Just as the eye is the head of the senses, so too disciplining it by controlling its glances, condemning its staring, and managing its glancing is among the noblest actions crossing over to praiseworthy discipline, indicative of the nobility of the soul and generosity of ambition.\n\nNeglecting its discipline and what results from it:\nAccording to that, neglecting it and casting its ray on what is not lawful and not praiseworthy is among the ugliest actions distancing from good, leading to slipping, indicative of the baseness of the soul and vileness of ambition. So make your covenant regarding what you cast your gaze upon among the first of your actions that you begin reforming in yourself. Know that it is the most fearful of your senses for you, and the closest of them to seizing your mind, for in its objects are the beauty of forms, the goodness of bodies, the grace of movements, the splendor of compositions, the colors of faces, and the brocades of faces which are the most tempting of perceived things in their beauty, the most destructive in entry to hearts, and the closest means to souls. Therefore, worshippers often need to isolate themselves from groups and flee from thoughts.\n\nBeware the deception of Satan!\nBeware in this matter that Satan deceives you, removing patience from your soul, and cutting off the strength in your resolve. He places in you the material for looking and staring at what is not lawful, and glancing with the pretext of considering what is not permissible to consider in the creation of Allah Almighty, marveling at the wonder of its structure and the elegance of its composition. He gradually leads you, deceiving, to where temptation can enable itself from your eye, and establish its position in your heart.\n\nMinor sins lead to major sins:\nIf you are heedless for a little while, enabling him from your eye, he will inevitably cast you either into fighting the impulses of your desire—fighting which you were free from occupying yourself with—or into submission to them. And when you are driven into the depths of temptations, there is no limit or end to them, for the eye is never satiated with looking, and the action of its desires is like the action of fire, which is its perceived object; the more wood is added, the more it flames.\n\nHow to flee?\nPrecaution against the disliked is by guarding against the first of its causes. Ascending to every beautiful thing is like descending to every ugly thing; the steps of descent, the first of them is close to what follows it, whether ascending or descending. The most beneficial prudence and consideration is in distinguishing the causes from which matters are generated. As for distinguishing matters at their end, that is not hidden from an ignorant person, let alone a scholar.\n\nYour soul blames you!\nKnow that it may bequeath you idleness and lead you to stupidity by prolonging the stare at what does not concern you, and looking at what does not benefit you. Likewise, it may judge you in some cases with silliness, and vileness blames you in the likes of being distracted by every ugly thing and looking at every hideous thing. Likewise, it may witness against you in some actions with arrogance and vanity, and in some with piety and humility.\n\nThe reins of the matter are in your hand!\nSo compel it to the best actions you praise in others, and clothe it in the most beautiful garments you find beautiful on others. Understand the places where you must lower it from what it desires to look at, and those where you must divert it to examining what you use. Which elegant sights bequeath it consideration, and which bequeath it temptation? Which ugly sights is approaching them knowledge and devotion, and which is silliness and degradation?\n\nWhat if you lowered your gaze?",

    "text": "Know that in lowering your gaze from looking at what is not safe lies a rest for the heart, a cutting off of evil, a reformation of the soul, and a cutting of material for whimsical will. Your lowering of the gaze connects you to the existence of your intellect, which is the origin of knowing your Lord, because knowledge of Him, Mighty and Majestic, is the product of sound intellect, and faith in Him, Mighty and Majestic, is the product of knowledge of Him. When the intellect is sound, knowledge grows, faith is truthful, and the heart rules over all limbs with acts of service. So contemplate—O my brother—your heart with sincerity, and be gentle in traveling the paths of safety from damaging afflictions and wandering thoughts.\n\nHow is the exit and escape?:\nKnow that the exit of directed vision is from beneficial intellect, the exit of indication is from intellectual knowledge, and the exit of thought is from the certainty of the heart. If looking at blessings persists, practical knowledge indicative of it supports it. Then knowledge falls upon it, so thought reveals what is in it of favor and benefit. Thus, souls become familiar with blessings, rejoice in their proximity, cut off from causes of [sinful] action, become solitary in their seclusion with their care, anxiety about other than them falls away, and connect with what preserves them and is intended by them. If the soul's knowledge of the Lord's blessings, Glorified and Exalted, is sound, the chest and heart expand for it, gratitude occurs, remembrance increases, joy and happiness are complete, pride becomes great, and life becomes pure and good.\n\nChapter\nHow do we catch up with the strivers and surpass the hasteners?\n\nAdvice of an experienced Sheikh!\nSome Sheikhs said to their disciple: O my son, shall I not guide you to a deed, much of the deeds of the righteous, by which you catch up with the striving worker, even if you are slow? Guard your glance and your tongue while fulfilling rights; that is the work of those firmly grounded. If you want to surpass the hastening rider, even if you are slow, occupy your heart and tongue with the remembrance of Allah, while leaving [personal] fortunes; that is from the deeds of the truthful (Siddiqin). Worship Allah on the path of knowledge, you will be safe from afflictions, and be sincere to Him on the path of truthfulness, you will be raised in degrees.\nSome worshippers looked at a boy and contemplated his beauty, so he was visited in his sleep and told: You will surely find its consequence after forty years.\nSome wise men said: The heart is like a house with six doors.\n\nWhat are the doors of the heart?\nThen it was said to him: Beware that nothing enters upon you from one of these doors that corrupts the house for you. The heart is the house, and its doors are: the mouth, the tongue, the hearing, the sight, the two hands, and the two feet. Opening these doors without knowledge is a waste of the house, and closing this house is an obligation, and blocking every door of these doors is an obligation, out of fear for the house from corruption. This house, if it is corrupted, the whole body is corrupted, due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Indeed in the body there is a morsel; if it is sound, the whole body is sound, and if it is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt. Indeed, it is the heart.\" So understand the preservation of these doors and be keen on it.\n\nLooking is the beginning!:\nKnow that the beginning of disobedience is looking. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The glance is a poisoned arrow from the arrows of Iblis.\"\n\nJesus, peace be upon him's, opinion on the glance:\nJesus, peace be upon him, said: \"Beware of the glance, for it sows regret in the heart.\"\n\nAnd looking!:\nIbn Sirin said: \"Beware of excess looking, for it leads to excess desire.\"\nDavid said to his son: \"O my son, walk behind a lion, but do not walk behind a woman.\"\n\nIbn Maktum looks at his feet!:\nAl-Aswad ibn Maktum used to look at his feet when he walked. Perhaps women would meet him, so some of them would say to others: Let not the stature of Al-Aswad ibn Maktum scare you; when he walks, he looks at his feet, he does not look at you.\n\nIslam urges protecting the woman:\nIn the Hadith: \"The worst of women are those who adorn themselves for men and tempt men, and the worst of men are those who adorn themselves for women and are tempted.\"\nFrom Ibn Umar - may Allah be pleased with him - he said: \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade that a man walk between two women.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood.\nFrom Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The woman is Awrah (private/to be covered); when she goes out, the devil raises his head at her.\"\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Keep distance between the breaths of men and the breaths of women.\"\nAnd what was reported that \"If a vein of a woman were in the East, and a vein of a man in the West, each one of them would yearn for its companion.\" So how about touching, speaking, and joking?! To Allah we belong and to Him we shall return over the lack of shame in committing sins.\n\nThe five that corrupt the heart:\nIt was narrated: \"Five things corrupt the heart: Seclusion with women, listening to them, taking their opinion, debating with a fool—for if you debate him you become like him—and sitting with the dead. It was said: Who are the dead? He said: Every rich person whom his wealth has made arrogant, and every unjust leader.\"",

    "text": "Are you two blind!!:\nFrom Umm Salamah - may Allah be pleased with her - she said: I was with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and Maymunah was with him. Ibn Umm Maktum approached, and that was after we were commanded with the hijab. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Veil yourselves from him.\" We said: O Messenger of Allah, is he not blind, unable to see us or recognize us? He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Are you two blind? Do you not see him?!\"\n\nThe Adolescent and the Woman:\nThe more correct view is that the adolescent is like the adult; the woman must veil herself from him just as she must veil herself from the castrated man (majbub). It is obligatory upon the boy's guardian to prevent him from looking at her just as it is obligatory to prevent him from fornication.\n\nChapter\nOn the Doors of Disobedience\n\nIbn al-Qayyim describes the disease and the cure:\nIbn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Most disobedience enters upon the servant through four doors, which are: Glances (Al-Lahzat), Thoughts (Al-Khatarat), Utterances (Al-Lafzat), and Steps (Al-Khutuwat). The servant should be the doorkeeper of himself at these four doors, and persist in guarding their breaches. Through them the enemy enters, roaming through the abodes and destroying whatever he overpowers with destruction.\n\nHead of Desires!:\nAs for Glances: It is the scout of desire and its messenger. Guarding it is the basis of guarding the private part. Whoever releases his gaze, it leads him to the resources of destruction. Since the beginning of that is from looking, the command to lower it was placed before guarding the private part. He said: All incidents begin with the gaze, and most fire is from small sparks. So it becomes a look, then a thought, then a step/sin. Therefore it was said: Whoever guards these four has preserved his religion.\n\nLowering the gaze bequeaths sweetness in the heart:\nKnow that whoever lowers his gaze from the beauties of a woman or a beardless boy for the sake of Allah Almighty, Allah will bequeath in his heart a sweetness until the day he meets Him. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Beware of sitting on the roads.\" They said: O Messenger of Allah, our gatherings, we have no escape from them. He said: \"If you must do so, then give the road its right.\" They said: What is its right? He said: \"Lowering the gaze, refraining from harm, and returning the greeting.\"\n\nOrigin of general incidents:\nLooking is the origin of most incidents that befall man. For the look generates a thought, then the thought generates an idea, then the idea generates a desire, then the desire generates a will, then it strengthens and becomes a firm resolve, so the action occurs inevitably unless something prevents it.\n\nFrom the evils of looking:\nAmong the evils of looking is that it bequeaths regrets, sighs, and burning pains. The servant sees what he is not capable of [attaining], nor patient to stay away from, and you have no power over it. How many have sent their glances which did not return except leaving him floundering among them, slain. It is strange that the glance of the looker is an arrow that does not reach the looked-at until it occupies a place in the heart of the looker. Stranger than that is that the look wounds the heart a wound, then follows it with a wound upon a wound, yet the pain of the wounds does not prevent him from summoning its repetition. It has been said: Restraining glances is easier than constant regrets.\n\nThoughts are the origin of good and evil:\nAs for Thoughts: Their matter is more difficult, for they are the beginning of good and evil. From them wills, ambitions, and resolves are generated. Whoever watches his thoughts owns the reins of his self and conquers his desire. Whoever his thoughts overcome, his desire and self conquer him. Whoever takes thoughts lightly, they lead him forcibly to destruction. Thoughts continue to frequent the heart until they become vain hopes (Like a mirage in a lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing but finds Allah before Him, He will pay him in full his due; and Allah is swift in account).\n\nWhoever wastes his time, wastes his life!:\nKnow, O my brother, that time is a sword; if you do not cut it, it cuts you. So do not occupy your heart and limbs with what you do not possess of the matter of your religion and hereafter. You must think about the duty of the time and its function and focus all concern on it. For the knower (*Arif*) is the son of his time; if he wastes it, all his interests are wasted. All interests only arise from time; if he wastes it, he can never recover it.",

    "text": "Al-Shafi'i's opinion on time:\nAl-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, said: I accompanied the Sufis and did not benefit from them except for two letters [phrases]. One of them is their saying: Time is a sword; if you do not cut it, it cuts you. And he mentioned the other word. The time of a human is his life in reality, and it is the material of his eternal life in everlasting bliss, and the material of his miserable living in painful punishment. It passes faster than the passing of clouds. Whatever of his time was for Allah and by Allah is his life and age; other than that is not counted as part of his life, even if he lived long in it, he lives the life of beasts. If he cut his time in heedlessness, desire, and false hopes, and the best of his cutting it was in sleep and idleness, then death for this one is better than his life. And if the servant while in prayer has nothing of his prayer except what he comprehended of it, then he has nothing of his life except what he was in by Allah. Let the human know that there is no thought but it is written either as a good deed or a bad deed, and striving without need has been forbidden.\n\nChoose your words well:\nAs for Utterances: Guarding them is by not letting out a wasted word; rather, he does not speak except in what he hopes for profit and increase in his religion. If he wants to speak a word, he looks: Is there benefit and profit in it or not? If there is no profit in it, he refrains from it. If there is profit in it, he looks: Will he miss by it a word that is more profitable? So he does not waste it with this one. If you want to infer what is in the hearts, infer it by the movement of the tongue, for it informs you of what is in the heart whether its owner wills or refuses.\n\nThe tongue reveals what is in the heart!:\nYahya bin Mu'adh said: \"Hearts are like pots boiling with what is in them, and their tongues are their ladles. So look at the man when he speaks, for his tongue ladles out for you what is in his heart of sweet and sour, fresh and salty, and other than that. The ladling of his tongue clarifies for you the taste of his heart.\"\n\nEntrance to Rectitude:\nIn the raised Hadith of Anas: \"The faith of a servant is not straight until his heart is straight, and his heart is not straight until his tongue is straight.\"\n\nKey to entering Hell:\nThe Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked about what most admits people into Hell? He said: \"The mouth and the private part.\"\nIn the two Sahihs: From the Hadith of Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Indeed, a servant may speak a word from the pleasure of Allah Almighty, not paying attention to it, by which Allah raises him degrees. And indeed, a servant may speak a word from the wrath of Allah Almighty, not paying attention to it, by which he falls into Hell.\"\nIn Jami' al-Tirmidhi from the Hadith of Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: \"A man from the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, died, so a man said: 'Rejoice in Paradise!' The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Or do you not know? Perhaps he spoke about what did not concern him or was stingy with what did not decrease him.'\" He said: A Hasan Hadith.\nIn the Sahih: \"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him say good or remain silent.\"\nAnd in it is the Hadith: \"Part of the perfection of a person's Islam is his leaving that which does not concern him.\"\nAnd in a Hadith: \"The speech of the son of Adam is against him, not for him, except commanding good, or forbidding evil, or the remembrance of Allah.\"\nHe said: The predecessors (Salaf), may Allah be pleased with them, and the successors (Khalaf) differed: Is everything he utters written? Or only good and evil? On two opinions: The more apparent is the first.\nSome of the predecessors said: \"All speech of the son of Adam is against him, not for him, except what was of the remembrance of Allah Almighty and what is allied to it.\"\n\nPraiseworthy traits of the tongue:\nKnow that in the tongue are ten praiseworthy traits: A guide by which clarity appears. A witness of good about the conscience. A judge that decides the speech. A preacher that forbids the ugly. A speaker that returns the answer. An intercessor by whom need is attained. A describer by whom things are known. An expresser thanking Allah Almighty and the brothers. A praiser removing rancor. And a comforter entertaining the ears.\nAs for Steps: Guarding them is by not moving his foot except in what he hopes for its reward with Allah. If there is no increase of reward in his steps, then sitting is better for him. Since the slip is two slips: the slip of the leg and the slip of the tongue, one came coupled with the other in His saying, Exalted is He: (And when the ignorant address them [harshly], they say [words of] peace). So Allah described them with rectitude in their utterances and their steps, just as He combined glances and thoughts in His saying, Exalted is He: (He knows the treachery of the eyes and what the breasts conceal).\n\nIn leaving meddling is success for wisdom:",

    "text": "Some of the Knowers (*Arifin*) said: \"Whoever leaves excess speech is granted wisdom. Whoever leaves excess food is granted the sweetness of worship. Whoever leaves laughter is granted awe. Whoever leaves desire [for the world] is granted Paradise. Whoever leaves spying is granted the reformation of his own faults. Whoever leaves imagining the 'how-ness' of Allah's Essence is granted fear (*Khashyah*) and is safe from doubt and hypocrisy. And whoever leaves bad suspicion is granted safety from bad belief regarding creation.\"\nIt was said: Permissible looking affects just as impermissible looking affects. It is only permitted for teachers without persistence, and one might not look at all and looking may not be possible for him.\nKnow that your limbs have etiquettes related to them. Our Sheikh - may Allah Almighty have mercy on him - said in his book *Al-Hidayah*: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The emigrant (*Muhajir*) is the one who emigrates from evil, and the struggler (*Mujahid*) is the one who struggles against his desire.\"\n\nUsing Allah's blessings for His disobedience is the height of ingratitude:\nDisobedience is only committed with the limbs, which are a blessing from Allah Almighty upon you, and a trust with you. So your using Allah's blessing for His disobedience is the height of ingratitude, and betraying a trust Allah entrusted to you is the height of tyranny. Your limbs are your subjects, so look how you tend them, for in the Hadith: \"All of you are shepherds and each is responsible for his flock.\"\n\nWork for a day when your limbs will testify against you:\nKnow that all your limbs will testify against you in the courts of Resurrection with a fluent tongue, exposing you before the heads of creation. Allah Almighty said: (That Day, We will seal over their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify about what they used to earn). And He said: (On a Day when their tongues, their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do).\nSo guard your entire body, especially the actions of your seven limbs, for Hell has seven gates, for each gate of them is a portion assigned. Only those who disobeyed Allah with these limbs are designated for those gates: The eye, the ear, the tongue, the hand, the belly, the private part, and the leg. For each limb of the limbs there are etiquettes specific to it.\n\nEtiquettes of each limb:\nThe etiquettes of Sight are to look at his brothers with a look of affection and love, which they recognize from you and whoever attends the gathering. His look should be at his good qualities and the best thing that appears from him, and he should not turn his gaze away from him when he [the brother] turns to him. He should lighten his gaze from the adornments of the world, like decorated buildings and things the soul aspires to seek the like of, and which endear women to the heart. Allah Almighty said: (And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] the splendor of worldly life).\nLet man know that sight is a news-bringer that transfers the state of seen things to the heart, so their images are imprinted. Thus, the heart should be protected from transferring what it leads to, so it can be open for what emanates from it of thought and remembrance. Then it is established that the noblest of things is seeing Allah Almighty with the eyes in the Hereafter; so it is worthy for the owner of this hope to protect this organ for what he hopes for it of that virtue.\nEtiquettes of Hearing: To listen to speech with a listening that desires what it hears, finding pleasure in it. When you speak to him, do not turn your gaze away from him, and do not interrupt his speech for any reason. If time compels you to something of that, inform him and show him your excuse! Beware of listening with it to a lute or flute, or listening with it to innovation, backbiting, obscenity, engaging in falsehood, mentioning people's faults, or other forbidden amusements, such as singing with poems that excite nature and desire, and listening to the speech of a foreign woman except for need. For a multitude of worshippers were tempted by speech just as others were tempted by sight.\n\nBeware of Backbiting!:\nAs for listening to backbiting and the like, which is emphasized to avoid, it is not specific to the speaker without the listener. In the Hadith, the listener is a partner to the speaker, for the listener is one of the backbiters. So he should purify his hearing just as he purifies his sight, because it is a news-bringer that delivers the news of heard things to the heart.\n\nGardens of Musk are the reward for one who purified himself and his hearing from gatherings of amusement:\nMuhammad ibn al-Munkadir, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, said: \"When it is the Day of Resurrection, a caller will call: Where are those who used to purify themselves and their hearing from gatherings of amusement and the flutes of devils? Make them dwell in the Gardens of Musk. Then He says to the angels: Make them hear My praise and glorification.\"\n\nEtiquettes of the Tongue:",

    "text": "To speak to your brothers with what they love, offer them your advice, guide them to what contains their benefit, drop from your speech what you know your brother dislikes of talk, word, or otherwise. Do not raise your voice over him, do not address him with what he dislikes, speak to him according to the measure of his understanding and knowledge. Protect your tongue from backbiting, gossip, evil, obscenity, cursing, mockery, ridicule, lying, false testimony, spreading secrets, false praise, and the speech of the two-faced.\n\nFaith... and the Tongue!:\nWhen the evils of the tongue became many, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The faith of a servant is not straight until his heart is straight, and his heart is not straight until his tongue is straight.\"\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"And does anything cast people into the Fire on their faces—or he said on their noses—except the harvests of their tongues?\"\n\nFor whom Allah guaranteed Paradise:\nHe said: \"Whoever guarantees for me what is between his jaws and between his legs, I guarantee for him Paradise.\"\nSufyan ibn Abdullah al-Thaqafi said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what is the most fearful thing you fear for me? He took hold of his own tongue, then said: This.\"\nIn the two Sahihs: From Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"Indeed, the servant speaks a word, by which he descends into the Fire farther than the distance between the East and the West.\"\n\nBeware of Cursing:\nIn the Hadith: \"The believer is not a defamer, nor a curser, nor obscene, nor vulgar.\" And in it: \"When a servant curses something, the curse ascends to the sky, and the gates of the sky are closed against it. Then it takes right and left; if it finds no passage, it returns to the one who was cursed, if he was deserving of it, otherwise it returns upon its sayer.\"\nFrom Abu Musa from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, he said: \"If you are able not to curse anything, then do so. For if the curse exits from its sayer and the cursed one was deserving of it, it strikes him. If he was not deserving of it, and the curser was deserving of it, it returns upon him. If he was not deserving of it, it strikes a Jew, or a Christian, or a Magian. So if you are able not to curse anything, then do so.\"\nIn the Hadith of Bilal ibn al-Harith, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: \"Indeed, a man speaks a word from the pleasure of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, not thinking it would reach where it reached, so Allah writes for him His pleasure until the Day of Resurrection. And indeed, a man speaks a word from the wrath of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, not thinking it would reach where it reached, so Allah writes against him His wrath until the Day of Resurrection.\"\nAlqama - may Allah have mercy on him - used to say: How many words has the Hadith of Bilal ibn al-Harith, may Allah be pleased with him, prevented me from saying.\"\nAnd Shumayt ibn Ajlan: \"O son of Adam, as long as you are silent you are safe; if you speak, take your caution.\"\n\nBoasting about Fathers:\nAmong what the tongue must be guarded from is boasting about fathers, especially fathers of the Jahiliyyah (Pre-Islamic era) and aggrandizement through them. That is not lawful due to His saying, Exalted is He: (O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you).\n\nSpecific to the Two Hands is refraining from striking with them in what is not lawful, touching what is not permissible, and cheating in measurement and weight. They even used to warn against clipping/pinching (?) with it. Harith, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"Beware of thoughts/snatching(?), for a man's hand acts hypocritically among the rest of his body. Guard them from approaching a Muslim with them [harmfully], or taking with them what is forbidden, or harming anyone with them, or betraying a trust with them, or writing with them what is not permissible—for the pen is one of the two tongues. Extend your hand to your brothers with kindness and assistance, and do not withhold them from them and from bestowing upon them and helping them.\nSpecific to the Belly is leaving the consumption of unlawful things (Haram), adultery (metaphorical/related to desire), eating the wealth of the orphan, the usurped, and the stolen.\n\nThe Effects Resulting from Satiety:",

    "text": "Be keen on seeking the lawful (Halal) and limit yourself from it to less than satiety. For satiety hardens the heart, corrupts the mind, nullifies memorization, distracts limbs from worship and knowledge, strengthens desires, and aids the armies of Satan. [Beware of] cutting off wealth with a false oath. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, cursed the consumer of usury (Riba) and its payer, and said: \"A dirham of usury which a man eats—while he knows—is worse with Allah than thirty-six acts of adultery.\" He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever swears an oath by which he cuts off the wealth of a Muslim man will meet Allah Almighty while He is angry with him.\"\nIbn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"A servant does not earn unlawful wealth and spend from it and it is blessed for him, nor does he give it in charity and it is accepted from him, nor does he leave it behind his back except that it is his provision to the Fire. Let one beware of consuming doubtful things, for they have an effect on the heart.\" The righteous predecessors—may Allah be pleased with them—used to leave seventy doors of the lawful for fear of falling into a door of doubt.\n\nHow are we able to guard the private part?:\nKnow that you cannot reach guarding the private part except by guarding the eye from looking, guarding the heart from thought, and guarding the belly from desires and from satiety. These are the movers of desire and its planting grounds. As for the Private Part: Guard it from everything Allah Almighty has forbidden. Allah Almighty said: (And who guard their private parts).\nOne cannot reach guarding the private part except by guarding the eye from looking, guarding the heart from thought, and guarding the belly from desires and from satiety. These are the movers of desire and its planting grounds. Among the greatest of what Al-Haytham ibn Malik al-Ta'i, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is that he said: \"There is no sin—after Shirk (associating partners) with Allah—greater with Allah than a drop [semen] a man places in a womb that is not lawful for him.\"\n\nWhat most admits people to Paradise, and what most admits them to Hell:\nAbu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he was asked about what most admits people to Paradise? He said: \"Fear of Allah Almighty (Taqwa).\" And he was asked about what most admits people to Hell? He said: \"The private part and the mouth.\" Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"If adultery and usury appear in a town, Allah permits its destruction.\"\nEtiquettes of the Two Legs: To walk with his brothers in the manner of a follower, not preceding them. If he brings him close to himself, he approaches to the extent he knows he needs, then returns to his place. He should not sit back from the rights of his brothers relying on trust in their brotherhood, for Al-Fudayl—may Allah be pleased with him—said: \"Leaving the rights of brothers is humiliation.\" He stands for his brothers when he sees them approaching, and does not sit except when they sit, and sits where they seat him.\nGuard your legs from walking with them to Haram or striving to the door of a ruler. For walking to unjust rulers without necessity or flattery is disobedience; it is humility and honoring of them, while Allah Almighty commanded turning away from them. It is increasing their numbers and aiding them in their injustice. If that was a means to seek their money, it is striving for Haram. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever humbles himself to a rich man, two-thirds of his religion is gone.\" This is regarding a righteous rich man, so what do you think of the unjust rich man?\n\nAdultery of the Limbs:\nAl-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from the Hadith of Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"The eyes commit adultery and their adultery is looking, the feet commit adultery and their adultery is striving/walking, the legs commit adultery and their adultery is walking, the mouth commits adultery and its adultery is kissing, the heart desires and wishes, and the private part confirms that or denies it.\"\nLet a human know that there is no step but it is written either as a good deed or a bad deed. Striving without need has been forbidden. So upon you, O my brother, is to restrain your senses and imprison your limbs, for they are counted against you. Count your breaths, and call yourself to account before the Day of Account.\n\nThe Caliph who calls himself to account:",

The most important of them is Looking, for its harm is great and its trial is immense. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever strikes a forbidden look at a woman, Allah will fill his eyes with fire on the Day of Resurrection, then he will be ordered to the Fire. And whoever is able to do so but leaves it, enters Paradise.\"\nHatim, may Allah have mercy on him, said: A man's adultery with a righteous woman is three things: Looking, Speaking, and Taking and Giving. If she looks at him and he looks at her and finds the sweetness of that, this is the adultery of the eye. If he says to her: O my sister, and she says to him: O my brother, and he finds the sweetness of that, this is the adultery of speech. If he gives her and takes, that is the adultery of Taking and Giving.\nIn the Hadith: \"Whoever guards what is between his jaws and between his legs enters [Paradise].\"\nDawud al-Ta'i, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"They used to dislike excess looking just as they disliked excess speech.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"No man is alone with a woman—who is not a Mahram—except that Satan is the third of them.\" Narrated by Al-Nasa'i.\nHe, upon him be blessings and peace, said: \"Looking at a beautiful woman is a arrow from the arrows of Iblis.\"\nFrom Abu Umamah al-Bahili, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Whoever looks at the beauties of a woman then lowers his gaze at the first instance, Allah creates for him an act of worship whose sweetness he finds in his heart.\"\n\n\"Benefit\": For one who fears temptation for himself!!:\nIf you look at a woman or other than her and fear temptation for yourself, turn your face away and say: As Yusuf, peace be upon him, said when he saw: \"Protect me, O Allah, by Your mercy, O Most Merciful of the merciful.\" Due to His Almighty's saying: (Had he not seen the proof of his Lord) the verse.\nAbu Ubaydah said regarding the Hadith of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Al-Muka'amah and Al-Mukama'ah\", Abu al-Nadr narrated it to me, from Al-Layth ibn Sa'd, from Abbas ibn Abbas who raised it [to the Prophet] and said: \"Al-Muka'amah\" is that a man kisses his companion. Taken from *ka'm al-ba'ir* (muzzling the camel), which is binding its mouth when it gets excited. It is said from it: *ka'amtuhu*. So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, made kissing when he kisses him like the muzzle.\nAs for his saying: \"Al-Mukama'ah\", it is that a man lies with his companion in one garment. Taken from *Al-Kami'*, and *Al-Kami'* is the bedfellow. From it, a woman's husband is called: \"her *Kami'* \".\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"A man should not lie with a man in one garment, nor should a woman lie with a woman in one garment.\" Narrated by Muslim.\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said regarding children: \"Order them to pray at seven, beat them for [abandoning] it at ten, and separate between them in beds.\"\nThis is regarding a brother with his brother. So how about an ignorant fool and fools like him! They establish brotherhood in their claim, and think that this is permissible for them. Perhaps they make brotherhood a basis for the permissibility of each one of them to his companion, so the man says 'my sister', and the Sheikh 'my daughter', so they legitimize what Allah has forbidden of that, and expose themselves to Allah's wrath by doing that. We ask Allah for protection, success, and guidance to the path by His grace and generosity.\n\n\"Benefit\" Regarding separation in beds:\nAl-Husni said: If the boy and girl reach ten years, it is obligatory to separate between him and his mother and father, and his sister and brother in beds, due to the texts reported regarding that. Greater than that is the companionship of young boys (Ahdath).\n\nCompanionship of Young Boys is the strongest of Satan's traps:",

    "text": "Sheikh Muhammad al-Mas'udi said: Abu al-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, said: Companionship of young boys (*Ahdath*) is the strongest of Satan's traps with which he hunts. The righteous predecessors used to exaggerate in turning away from beardless boys (*Murd*). For this reason, Mujahid narrated from Al-Sha'bi saying: \"The delegation of Abd al-Qays came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and among them was a beardless boy of evident beauty. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, made him stand up from before him and seated him behind his back,\" distancing him from his sight. This is not what a group of the poor [Sufis] of the countryside do, sitting youths behind their backs continuously in the way of companionship and mixing—we seek refuge in Allah from that—and whoever does that has innovated.\nBrothers, if the Master of Mankind warned against looking at a beardless boy with this caution, what do you think of the people of this time? In danger are hearts filled with desires, and bodies nourished with doubtful things and prohibitions. Is temptation in them anything but faster than the landing of a fly in honey? Does anyone dispute this except one whose mind is deranged? We ask Allah for safety.\nAbu Bakr Muhammad ibn Musa al-Wasiti said: \"If Allah wants the humiliation of a servant, He throws him to these carcasses (jif),\" meaning by that the attachment of the heart.\nAbu al-Faraj said: Ibn al-Mubarak said: Sufyan al-Thawri entered the bathhouse, and a beautiful-faced boy entered upon him. He said: \"Get him out, get him out! For I see with every woman a devil, and with every boy more than ten devils.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Do not sit with the sons of kings, for souls yearn for them with a yearning they do not have for freed slave-girls.\"\nFrom Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Do not fill your eyes with the sons of kings, for they have a temptation stronger than virgins.\"\n\nChapter\nOn How a Boy Should Be\n\nA boy should have much modesty (*Haya'*), and little mixing with strangers. Wahb ibn Munabbih said: If a boy has two traits: Modesty and Fear/Reverence (*Rahba*), his good is hoped for.\nUmar ibn al-Khattab said: \"I do not fear for a scholar from a predatory beast more than I fear for him from a beardless boy.\"\nAl-Hasan ibn Dhakwan said: \"Do not sit with the children of the rich, for they have images like the images of women, and they are a stronger temptation than virgins.\"\nSome of them said: \"All incidents are from looking.\"\nAbu Ali al-Rudhbari, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Ahmad al-Mu'addib, may Allah have mercy on him, said to me: We have seen those stronger in faith than the Sufis, yet when he sees a young boy approaching, he flees from him like his fleeing from a lion!\n\nChapter\nOn the Qualities in which Looking at Women and Hearing their Voice is Permissible\n\nQualities permitting looking:\nKnow that looking at women intentionally is not permissible except for four qualities: When intending marriage, when testifying against her, if they are Mahrams (unmarriageable kin) to him such as the mother, sister, maternal aunt, and paternal aunt, and the husband's looking at the wife.\n\nWhen hearing her voice is permissible:\nHearing her voice is not permissible except in certain things: in selling, buying, asking for a fatwa (religious ruling), litigation, testimony, and narration.\n\nRuling on a man looking at a woman:\nSheikh Taqi al-Din ibn al-Husni said: A man's looking at a foreign woman (Ajnabiyyah) is of seven types:\nOne of them: A look at a foreign woman without need. This is not permissible for the adult male, and likewise the woman, meaning the adult female. Furthermore, looking is either not called for by need, or it may be called for by need.\nFirst Type: That no need calls for it. In this case, it is forbidden for a man to look at the 'Awrah of a slave-girl if he fears temptation. If he does not fear temptation, contrary to the correct view [which forbids it], the prohibition was stated by Al-Istakhri and Abu Ali al-Tabari, and chosen by Sheikh Abu Muhammad. Sheikh Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi stated it definitively, and Al-Ruyani. The Imam justified it by the consensus of Muslims on preventing women from going out [unveiled], and that looking is a presumptive cause of temptation and a stirrer of desire. So it is more fitting for the beauties of the Sharia to block this door and turn away from details of conditions, just as seclusion with a foreign woman is forbidden. He argued for it with the generality of His Almighty's saying: (Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts).\n\nRuling on the adolescent's looking:",

    "text": "Does the adolescent have the right to look? There are two views, the more correct of which is: His looking is like the looking of an adult due to his exposure to the Awrahs of women, meaning he is like an adult; a woman must veil herself from him just as she is definitively required to veil herself from a castrated man (*Majbub*). The guardian is obligated to prevent him from looking just as he prevents him from adultery and other prohibitions.\nAs for the ruling on the *Mamsuh* (one with erased genitals), who is the eunuch (*Tawashi*), some said: He is like the *Majbub*, so he is prevented from looking.\nKnow that the one whose penis only is cut off, or whose testicles only are removed, and the impotent (*'Innin*), and the decrepit old man—their ruling is the ruling of the potent male according to what the majority said.\nAs for a woman's slave, meaning her bondsman: He is like a foreign man (*Ajnabi*), so it is forbidden for him to look [at her], and forbidden for her, and veiling from him is obligatory. For this reason, if he touched her or she touched him, wudu is definitively broken. Al-Nawawi said: Al-Imrani and others stated clearly that the female slave is like the free woman, which is the implication of the disagreement among many, and it is the preponderant view by evidence. Even if the free woman is old, Al-Ghazali appended her to the young woman. He said: Because desire is not regulated, and she is a locus for intercourse. Qadi Husayn said: Old women who apply kohl to men on the day of Ashura are committing Haram. Al-Husni said this in the explanation of Abu Shuja'.\n\nSecond Type: His looking at his wife and his slave-girl. It is permissible to look at everything except the private part of them. It is permissible for a man to look at the entire body of his wife because it is permissible to enjoy her. Likewise the slave-girl in that, whether she is a pure slave (*Qinna*), a *Mudabbara* (freed upon death), or an *Umm Walad* (mother of a child). Know that a wife's looking at her husband is like his looking at her.\n\nThird Type: His looking at his Mahrams, or his married slave-girl. It is permissible regarding what is other than [between] the navel and the knee.\n\nFourth Type: Looking for the sake of marriage. It is permissible [to look] at the face and hands. It was mentioned that looking may not be called for by need, or need may touch upon it. It was mentioned in the First Type and Second Type what need touches upon. Need includes several matters, among them: Intention of marriage. If a man wants to marry a woman he desires, there is no doubt about the permissibility of looking at her. This is recommended due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, to Al-Mughira: \"Look at her, for it is more likely to bring harmony between you.\" Narrated by Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah, and Al-Tirmidhi declared it Hasan, and Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim, who said: On the condition of the two Sheikhs (Bukhari and Muslim), and other reports. It is permissible to repeat looking, whether he looks with her permission or without her permission. If it is not easy for him, he sends a woman to observe her and describe her to him; because he, upon him be peace, sent Umm Sulaym to a woman and said: \"Look at her achilles tendon and smell her sides (mouth/neck).\" Then looking at her hand, back and palm. He does not look at other than that. In one view, he looks at her like a man looks at a man. This looking is permitted. The time of looking is after resolving to marry her, and before the proposal, lest he leave her after the proposal and hurt her. This is the correct view. It was said he looks when permission is given for the marriage contract. It was said upon the inclination of each one to the other. If he looks and she does not please him, let him be silent and not say: I do not want her, for it is hurtful. And Allah knows best.\n\nFifth Type: Looking for medical treatment at the places needed. Among the places of need is looking at a foreign woman due to her need for phlebotomy or cupping or treating that, because Umm Sulaym, may Allah be pleased with her, asked the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, for permission for cupping, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, ordered \"Abu Taybah to cup her.\" Narrated by Muslim. Let that be in the presence of a Mahram or husband in case of seclusion, and on the condition that the doctor is not a Dhimmi (non-Muslim subject) while a Muslim exists.\n\nSixth Type: Looking for testimony and business dealing (*Makatabah*?). It is permissible to look at the face specifically. Among the places of need: Permissibility of looking at the breast of a wet nurse for the purpose of testifying to breastfeeding. Likewise looking at the private parts of fornicators; for the purpose of testifying against them, because need calls for that.\n\nSeventh Type: Looking at a slave-girl when buying her. It is permissible to look at the places needed in examining her, from the places of need. And Allah knows best.\n\nNotice on explaining Awrahs and their rulings",

    "text": "Our Sheikh said: Know that the Awrah (intimate parts/nakedness) of a man is from his navel to his knee. This is the limit of the man's Awrah regarding a man, and the woman regarding a woman. As for the woman regarding a foreign man: She is all Awrah unless she is a slave-girl, so the limit of her Awrah regarding a man is like the limit of a man's Awrah with a man, except that it is disliked for him to look at what is forbidden for him regarding a [free] woman, for fear of temptation.\nAs for Mahrams (unmarriageable kin): It is permissible to look from them at what is customarily exposed, like the hands, feet, part of the shin, and part of the forearm. This was pardoned only due to hardship.\nAs for the Awrah of a Muslim woman regarding a Dhimmi woman: It is like the Awrah of a woman with a man.\nThe Man: As for looking at the Awrah of a child below seven years, the ruling of Awrah is not established for him. Thus, it is permissible for a woman to wash him, and for a man to wash a girl if she is below seven years. What is emphasized to lower the gaze from—especially in the bathhouse—is the beardless boy (*Amrad*), especially the beautiful of image.\nThe Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Ali, may Allah honor his face: \"Do not follow a glance with a glance, for the first is for you and the other is not for you.\"\nIt was said: Ibrahim ibn Adham wrote to Sufyan al-Thawri: \"Whoever unleashes a glance, his regret is prolonged. Whoever unleashes his hope, his deed becomes bad. Whoever unleashes his tongue, kills himself.\"\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Looking at the beauties of a beardless boy is a poisoned arrow.\" It is forbidden for the guardian to enable him to enter with a man or men who are not Mahrams to him, because seclusion with a beardless boy is like seclusion with a woman, as Al-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, mentioned in his Fatwas.\nIt is forbidden for a man and a woman to look at the face of a beardless boy with desire. Her looking is [forbidden] according to the correct view. A woman is forbidden from looking at other than her husband unless he is someone permissible to look at. It is forbidden for her to look from a woman at what is between her navel and her knee. The more correct view is the prohibition of a disbelieving woman looking at the body of a Muslim woman. It is forbidden for a Muslim woman to uncover in the presence of a Kitabi (Christian/Jewish) woman. It is forbidden to enter the bathhouse with Kitabi women and Harbi (women at war) women. If she enters with them, she must cover her entire body except what appears during work, nothing else.\nImam Allamah Sheikh Izz al-Din ibn Abd al-Salam said: The sinful woman (*Fasiqa*) has the ruling of the Dhimmi woman in that. Those in authority should be keen to prevent Dhimmi and sinful women from entering the bathhouse with chaste believing women. If that is difficult due to the lack of concern of those in authority in denouncing that, let the free believing woman guard herself from the disbeliever and the sinner.\nFrom Qays ibn al-Harith, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, wrote to Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah: It has reached me that Muslim women in your region enter bathhouses with polytheist women. He forbade that with strict prohibition, for it is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day that her Awrah be seen by other than the people of her religion, and that nothing of her body be seen other than the face and hands outside the bathhouse. Abu Ubaydah said—while angry, and he was not prone to anger—: \"O Allah, any woman who enters the bathhouse without illness or sickness, intending thereby to whiten her face, may Allah not whiten her face on the day faces are whitened.\"\nAs for the slave-girl, it is forbidden for other than her master to look at her. The forearm of a free woman, her head hair, the pubic hair of a man and similar things are forbidden [to look at] when attached, and likewise when detached according to the more correct view. Also according to the more correct view, it is forbidden to look at the nail clippings of a woman's foot, not her hand clippings. It is disliked for a man and a woman to look at their own private parts without need.\nAs for the spouses looking at each other's private parts: There are two views: One is prohibition, and one is dislike, except the \"anal ring\". It is forbidden for a man to touch a man's thigh without a barrier, and likewise from over a garment if he fears temptation. It is forbidden to touch everything permissible to look at of Mahrams; so it is not permissible for a man to touch his mother's belly or back, nor to press her shin or leg, nor to kiss her face. Likewise, it is not permissible to order his daughter or sister to press his legs or massage him.\nIbn al-Hajj said: It is not permissible for one covering his Awrah to gather with one uncovering his Awrah under one roof.\n\nPlaces where uncovering Awrah is permissible:\nKnow that uncovering Awrah is not permissible except in four places: During intercourse under a cover, during relieving oneself inside a toilet or covering the Awrah in the open/desert, or during washing oneself covered in a private place or otherwise—and if one washed while covering the Awrah it is permissible—and upon seeing a doctor. Uncovering is permissible in these states for the duration of the need in all these states. Exceeding the amount of need is forbidden according to the more correct view, because covering the Awrah in seclusion is obligatory according to the more correct view, mentioned by Al-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim. It is forbidden to look with desire at other than a beardless boy, men, Mahrams, old men, and old women.\n\nLooking into people's houses:",

    "text": "As for looking into people's houses without their permission, it is forbidden. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever looks into the house of a people without their permission, it becomes lawful for them to gouge out his eye.\" Narrated by Muslim. He also said: \"If a man looked at you without permission and you threw a pebble at him and gouged out his eye, there would be no sin upon you.\" Agreed upon.\n\nChapter\nOn the Etiquettes of Boys Entering the Bathhouse\n\nAs for boys entering the bathhouse with each other: It is possible that it is like women entering with each other, so it is permissible. And it is possible that it is like men too, so it is permissible. The better course is not to mix them in entering for fear of corruption.\nAs for the adult *Mamsuh* (eunuch), some permitted it and some forbade it. Likewise the *Majbub* whose testicles remain, the castrated one (*Khasi*) whose penis remains, the impotent (*'Innin*) incapable of intercourse, the effeminate (*Mukhannath*), and the decrepit old man. A group permitted these to look at women, and others forbade it. Those who permitted it said: They are not of those possessing desire (*Uli al-Irbah*). Those who forbade it said: Because of the generality of His Almighty's saying: (Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision), the verse. This is the truth that is issued as fatwa.\nIbn al-Sabbagh, may Allah have mercy on him, said: It is not permissible for a castrated man to look at the body of a foreign woman unless he becomes old and decrepit, and his desire goes away. Likewise the effeminate. Seclusion with a foreign woman is forbidden, whether in a bathhouse, a house, or a road.\nAbu Zakariya al-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in *Al-Rawdah*: The narration from the Companions [of the Shafi'i school] is that it is not permissible for a man to be alone with one woman, but it is permissible for a man to be alone with two trustworthy women, because a woman's shyness from another woman is greater than a man's shyness from another man.\n\nStates of the Ambiguous Hermaphrodite (*Khuntha Mushkil*):\nAs for the ambiguous hermaphrodite, he has states:\nFirst: To enter the bathhouse with a woman. This is forbidden; because of the possibility of being a man, and seclusion with her is forbidden.\nSecond: To enter with two men or men. This is also forbidden; because of the possibility of being a woman.\nThird: To enter with two women or women. That is permissible; because a man's seclusion with women is permissible according to the correct view.\nFourth: To enter the bathhouse with a hermaphrodite. This is forbidden because of the possibility one is male and the other female.\nFifth: To be with two hermaphrodites or hermaphrodites. This is forbidden.\n\nNotices:\nFirst: The repetition of verses, hadiths, and similar chapters in this book is for an added benefit or a returning utility.\nSecond: This book is set forth by way of exhortation and warning, so there is no objection if speech moves from his school of thought (Madhhab) to the school of another, because speech in exhortation is not restricted to the speaker's Madhhab. Our Sheikh was asked: Why do you speak in the Madhhab of others or why do you exit your Madhhab? He said: If the speaker is in exhortation, he has the right to speak in the four Madhhabs, but if he is in a Fiqh lesson, he does not exit his Madhhab.\n\nChapter\nComprehensive on Clarifying the Sunnah regarding Conditions Related to Youths and Women in their Gathering in Noble Places and Others, and What They Are Commanded and Forbidden\n\nKnow that the Sunnah when women and youths are present in prayer, whether in a mosque or elsewhere, is that the people of knowledge and Sheikhs stand behind the Imam, due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Let those of you who possess dreams (maturity) and intelligence be near me.\" Then the general public behind them right and left. Youths stand behind them, then women behind the youths. If a youth advances in front of the men, he is ordered to move back behind them, like his action, peace and blessings be upon him, when he made a youth stand up from before him and seated him behind him. This was not during prayer, so it is more appropriate regarding him to delay in prayer. And Allah knows best.\nAs for the evidence for delaying youths behind men in prayer, it is what was narrated from Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that his grandmother Mulaykah invited the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, to food she made. He ate from it then said: \"Stand up so I may pray for you.\" Anas said: So I stood up to a mat of ours that had turned black from long use, so I sprinkled it with water. He, peace and blessings be upon him, stood on it, and I and the orphan aligned behind him, and the old woman behind us. He prayed two rak'ahs with us and left, peace and blessings be upon him. In Muslim: \"That the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, prayed with him and his mother, so he placed me on his right, and placed the woman behind us.\"\nFrom Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The best rows for men are the first ones and the worst are the last ones, and the best rows for women are the last ones and the worst are the first ones.\" Narrated by Muslim, Abu Dawood, Al-Tirmidhi, and Al-Nasa'i.\nThe Sunnah in their sitting in circles of Dhikr: If men and youths are present, the Sunnah is that men form a circle, then youths form a circle behind them. That is further from temptation and safer for hearts. It is an etiquette regarding youths; and men must lower their gazes from the youths facing them, and that is a condition in Dhikr.\n\nThe Sunnah in their gatherings in schools (Makatib):",

    "text": "Our Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, said: It is appropriate for the Faqih (teacher) to adopt a spacious place to teach the Quran in, to sit for reading while in a state of purity, and to tend to the children with the eye of care, due to the Hadith \"Every shepherd is responsible for his flock.\" He should not let the boys mix with each other, except for some to teach others. The Sunnah, if he has women and boys, is that each sit alone and separate some from others.\nMalik, may Allah have mercy on him, said: I dislike for the teacher to teach women. If he teaches them, he should not let them sit with the boys, for fear they might corrupt [them]. It is appropriate for the teacher, whether in a mosque or elsewhere, to be trustworthy, chaste, pious, preserving [himself], married. He should not look at a boy without need; if he looks at him without need, that is forbidden for him, and touching him is forbidden. If the teacher fears temptation for himself, he puts the boy behind him and teaches him. He said: Abu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy on him, used to seat \"Muhammad ibn al-Hasan\" behind him then teach him, out of fear of temptation and following the Sunnah.\nThe monitor (*Arif*) should not enable isolating with a boy in a place alone for the sake of learning; rather, they should all sit in the presence of the Faqih. He should not permit two boys to go out to relieve themselves, but one after another. If he sees two gathered without necessity, he separates them after frightening them, forbidding them, and teaching them what they need of religious matters. He prevents them from erasing the Quran with spit. The Sunnah is to make for them a container with water in which they wipe their tablets. If it becomes black, he orders them to pour it into the flowing sea. Our Faqih - may Allah have mercy on him - used to order us to do that. If there is no sea or river there, he orders them to dig a small hole in the ground and pour the water into it. It is not appropriate for the teacher to teach a girl \"Surah Yusuf\". It was narrated that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Teach them spinning, do not house them in upper rooms, and do not teach them writing.\" Narrated by Al-Bazzar.\n\nChapter\nOn What is Permissible for the Faqih Regarding Beating the Boy\n\nThe scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, said: It is permissible for the Faqih to beat with conditions:\nFirst: That it not be with something that wounds the body.\nSecond: That it not break a bone.\nThird: That the beating be beneficial and useful; if it is not useful, beating is not permissible.\nFourth: That he is not deterred without beating, such as by intimidation, threat, and the like. Punishment by biting is not lawful, because it is not permitted in any form except in necessity.\nFifth: That the beating not be on the face.\nSixth: That it not be on a fatal spot.\nSeventh: That it be for the benefit of the boy. If the guardian disciplines him for his benefit, or the Faqih for a benefit other than the benefit of the minor, it is not permissible, because it is forbidden to use him for his needs by which the boy's interests are missed.\nEighth: That it be after discernment (*Tamyiz*). Discernment is at seven years usually; it may be before that or delayed. The criterion is understanding speech, returning an answer, going to the toilet for urine and feces, and covering the Awrah. Whenever that is found in him, he has discerned. If he reaches ten years, it is obligatory to beat him for prayer.\n\nThe Sunnah regarding their going up the minaret for Adhan:\nIf there is a mu'adhin among them, the Sunnah is not to enable youths to go up the minaret with one man, for seclusion with a beardless boy is forbidden just as seclusion with a foreign woman is forbidden. Nor with two men, unless he is alone so he is permitted to ascend the minaret. For his seclusion with two men is forbidden like the seclusion of two men with a woman, and that is also forbidden.\nOur Sheikh said in *Risalat al-Nur*: It is forbidden for the boy's guardian to enable him to be alone with a man or men who are not his Mahrams, just as it is forbidden for him to enable him to enter the bathhouse with a man or men who are not his Mahrams, because seclusion with a beardless boy is like seclusion with a woman, as Al-Nawawi mentioned in his Fatwas. He restricted the prohibition of looking in his book *Al-Riyad* and *Al-Tibyan* to when he is handsome. Some said: Especially if he is plump, or from the boys of this time in general, be they Turks, Arabs, urbanites, or others. However, if a group of youths have a habit of ascending the minaret intending Adhan, it is permissible—with safety from corruption—for them together. If corruption is not safe, they are prevented from going up. Their entering the bathhouse is analogous.\n\nBoys entering the bathhouse with each other:\nOur Sheikh said: As for boys entering the bathhouse with each other: It is possible that it is like women entering with each other, so it is permissible. And it is possible that it is like men too, so it is permissible. The better course is not to mix boys in entering; because corruption often occurs between them. If that is verified, they are prevented. It is forbidden for the guardian to enable the boy to enter with foreign men. And Allah knows best.\n\nClarification of Interests and Harms in Entering the Bathhouse, What is Disliked for Men, and What is Forbidden for Women Except for Necessity!",

He said: \"So whoever enters it, let him cover himself.\"\nKnow that among the greatest corruptions necessitating cursing is entering the bathhouse without a waistcloth (*Mi'zar*). In the Hadith: \"Allah cursed the looker and the looked at.\"\nFrom Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade men and women from bathhouses.

If he enters it without need, but intending luxury and adornment for worldly purposes. Our Sheikh said: The apparent meaning of Al-Ghazali's words in *Al-Ihya* and Abu Bakr al-Sam'ani is that it is disliked.\nIt was narrated from Ali and Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both: \"What a miserable house is the bathhouse; it reveals the Awrah and removes modesty.\"\nImam Ahmad narrated with his chain to Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: O people, I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, saying: \"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table where wine is circulated.

Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him not enter the bathhouse except with a waistcloth. Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him say good or remain silent. And whoever among your women believes in Allah and the Last Day, let her not enter the bathhouse.\"\nAll these traditions indicate prohibiting the permissibility of the bathhouse for men [without covering] and for women.\nOur Sheikh said: Sheikh Shihab al-Din ibn al-Imad said: Entering the bathhouse may become obligatory in some situations, which is entering for washing from Janabah (major impurity), menstruation, and postpartum bleeding, where washing outside is impossible for some reason.\nIt may become recommended, such as if he enters for a recommended wash like washing for the two Eids, Friday, and others, or to remove dirt that harms him to an extent preventing Khushu' (humility) in prayer and he could not wash outside, or inside for healing from a disease or harm.\nIt may become disliked, such as if he enters it for a corrupt purpose as preceded, or enters it between Maghrib and Isha, or before sunset, or enters it while fasting, or enters it while afflicted.\nDislike may arise for him from a medical perspective due to fever, disease, swelling, humors, or entering it while full before digesting food.\nIt may become forbidden, such as if he enters with uncovered Awrah, or enters where one who does not cover his Awrah is, or as a tool to enter into a forbidden seclusion like seclusion with a handsome beardless boy; so entering becomes forbidden due to these causes.\nAs for clarifying the permissibility of women entering it after their prohibition from it, the opinions of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, differed regarding the permissibility of entering for them.\nFirst: Absolute permissibility, which is the opinion of Abu Darda, Ibn Abbas, and others.\nSecond Opinion: Absolute prohibition. This is narrated from Ibn Umar; it was narrated from him that he said: \"The bathhouse is of the luxury they invented.\" This implies leaving it is better.\nThird: Prohibition except for a sick woman or a woman in postpartum. This is narrated from Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to his companions: \"You will conquer the land of the Persians, and in it are houses called 'Bathhouses' (Hammamat). It is forbidden for the men of my nation except with a waistcloth, and for the women of my nation except a woman in postpartum or sick.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood and others.\nAl-Ruyani transmitted from Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: It is absolutely forbidden for them to enter except for necessity.\nThe author of *Al-Faiq fi al-Lafz al-Ra'iq* said from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"There will be bathhouses after me, and there is no good in bathhouses for women.\"\nAl-Hafiz Abu Nu'aym narrated in *Tarikh Asbahan* from Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"A house in Syria; it is not lawful for believing men to enter it except with a waistcloth, and it is not lawful for believing women to enter it at all.\" If necessity calls her, entering is permissible. Al-Ghazali, may Allah have mercy on him, said: In that case, she enters with a covering waistcloth.\nFourth Opinion: Prohibition for women absolutely, unlike men [who can enter] with a waistcloth.\nFrom Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The woman is Awrah; when she goes out, the devil raises his head at her. The closest she is to her Lord is when she is in the depth of her house.\" Narrated by Ibn Majah in his Sunan and Ibn Hibban in his Sahih and others.\nAl-Baghawi corrected in *Al-Rawdah* the permissibility of entering for a woman absolutely with dislike.",

    "text": "Sheikh Shihab al-Din ibn al-Imad said regarding the opinion of absolute permissibility: She is only permitted to enter with conditions:\nFirst: That the husband permits her in that. If the husband does not permit her, entering is forbidden for her. He said: It is disliked for the husband to permit her in it. Al-Ghazali, may Allah have mercy on him, said in *Al-Ihya*: It is disliked for him to pay the fee for her, because he helps her in the disliked. This is if she intended entering for luxury. If her necessity called for her entering to wash from menstruation, postpartum bleeding, Janabah, or dirt, and she could not wash outside, he must enable her to enter. The capable, prudent man should empty a private place for her with trustworthy women. Entering at night is better; a group of the predecessors mentioned that. If she wants to enter for menstruation or the like of what she must do, she intends that intention from her house so her walking to it becomes worship.\nSecond Condition: That women do not mix with foreign men.\nThird Condition: That they do not enter except with a waistcloth covering [what prevents] the skin from appearing, like the covering of prayer. Men and women share in this according to the more correct view; because Allah Almighty is more worthy to be shy of, so covering is obligatory so Allah Almighty does not see him abandoning His etiquette and what He commanded him. If a guardian brings a boy into the bathhouse, he must cover him, and likewise the girl if they reached the limit of desire.\nFourth Condition: That they do not enter the bathhouse except with Muslim women. If a woman enters with Kitabi or Harbi women, there are two views: The more correct in *Al-Sharh* and *Al-Rawdah* in the Book of Marriage and Jizya: Prohibition.\n\nChapter\nOn the Harms that Befall a Woman in Her Going Out and the Sin She Incurs\n\nOur Sheikh said: In the Musnad of Imam Ahmad, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Any woman who applies perfume then goes out to the road is an adulteress.\"\nAisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said: \"If the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, had seen what women introduced after him, he would have prevented them from the mosques, as the women of Banu Israel were prevented.\" Agreed upon. This is her saying about the women of her time, so how about if she saw the women of our time? But we ask Allah for pardon and safety for us and them and for the nation of Muhammad, all together.\n\nHarms of women coming to bathhouses:\nSome of them said: Coming of women to the bathhouse results in many harms, among them: Leaving prayer at its time. Among them: Showing adornment which she was commanded to hide from strangers, and show to the husband. Among them: Disturbing men with what appears from under the wrap of jewelry and colored cloth. Among them: Her walking swaying. Among them: Showing the scent of perfume and similar scandals done by women of some of this time. This opens the ways of Satan and harms many people.\nFrom Mu'adh ibn Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: The most fearful thing I fear for you is the temptation of women when they wear gold bracelets and wear the Riyt (thin cloths) of Sham and the Asb (Yemeni cloth) of Yemen, tiring the rich and burdening the poor with what he cannot find. Narrated by Ahmad.\nFrom Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: When Iblis - may Allah curse him - was sent down to earth, he said: My Lord, make a house for me. He said: The bathhouse. He said: Make a gathering place for me. He said: Markets and road intersections. He said: Make traps for me. He said: Women.\"\nIn the Sahih from the Hadith of Usama, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"I have not left after me a temptation more harmful to men than women.\"\nIn Sahih Muslim: \"So fear the world and fear women, for the first trial of Banu Israel was in women.\"\nFrom Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with them both, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"When a woman goes out, the devil raises his head at her. The closest a woman is to her Lord is when she is in the depth of her house.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood and Al-Tirmidhi.\nAmong the harms resulting from entering the bathhouse: The corrupting woman may not be able to do what she wants except with the excuse of the bathhouse. For the plot of women is greater than the plot of Satan as Allah Almighty said: (Indeed, your plot is great). Luqman said to his son while admonishing him: O my son, disobey women in good so they do not bring you evil. Fear their worst, and be on guard with their best, for they do not hasten to good, but rather they are faster to evil. We ask Allah for safety by His grace and generosity.\n\nChapter\nEtiquettes and Rulings Inside the Bathhouse\n\nInside the bathhouse, one guards against looking at bodies, for looking at them with desire is forbidden for him, whether it is the body of a beardless boy or a bearded man, and whether it is the face or otherwise. Touching the whole body with desire is forbidden. He must denounce what he sees contrary to the Sunnah with his hand, tongue, or heart as mentioned in the famous authentic Hadith.\n\nCover yourself, may Allah cover you:",

    "text": "He should command gently and say to the one with exposed Awrah: Cover yourself, may Allah cover you. And say to him: Exposing the Awrah is forbidden. Whoever enters the bathhouse without a covering has committed transgression (*Fisq*), and his testimony is not accepted, whether man or woman. Likewise if he enters with a covering then removes it in the presence of people, and sits naked washing with Sidr and the like, that is Fisq dropping testimony. If he sees a naked person without covering, he returns or casts his gaze to the ground and faces the wall as Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, did.\n\nDuty of the Muslim upon entering the bathhouse:\nSufyan ibn Uyaynah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: They used to like that when they entered the bathhouse to say: O Good One (*Barr*), O Merciful, bestow upon us, and protect us from the punishment of the Scorching Fire. From Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, that when he entered the bathhouse he put his hand in the basin and said: In the name of Allah, what a good house is the bathhouse for one who wants to remember, and what a miserable house is the bathhouse for one from whom Allah has removed shame. And he says when people crowd and engage in their confusion: O Allah, I ask You for safety from the terror of the Day of Resurrection.\n\nChapter\nOn the Prohibition of Using Clay in the Bathhouse\n\nThe author of *Al-Ilmam* said: If the washer enters the bathhouse to wash from Janabah, menstruation, postpartum bleeding, or for dirtiness of his head or body or for medical treatment, he may wash with Sidr or Marshmallow (*Khitmi*). But let him beware of using clay (*Tin*) inside the bathhouse or outside it. For it was narrated from Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever washes his head with clay, he has washed with his flesh, and whoever eats clay eats his flesh.\"\nFrom Salman from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Whoever eats clay helps in killing himself.\"\nFrom Aisha she said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Do not eat clay, for it changes the color, enlarges the belly, and helps in killing.\"\n\nChapter\nOn the Prohibition of Exposing the Awrah in the Bathhouse and Prohibition of Enabling Others to Touch It\n\nOur Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, said: It is forbidden for him to enable another to wash his Awrah; rather he undertakes washing it himself. Let him beware of what some lenient transgressors (*Fusaq*) do in that, enabling the bath attendant (*Ballan*) to shave his pubes. This is not practiced except by one in whom all traits of baseness and vileness are complete. It is not lawful for a man or a hermaphrodite to massage the body of a woman, nor a hermaphrodite to massage the body of a man due to the possibility of being a woman. The handsome beardless boy is like the woman in this. There is no harm in what is customary of the bath attendant or another massaging his back and removing dirt with the palm and the like if he does not look at the Awrah or touch it.\nAnas narrated raised to Musa ibn Imran, peace be upon him: When he washed, he did not remove his garment until he covered his Awrah with water. In the Hadith from him, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Indeed water has inhabitants (*Awamir*) from the angels like the inhabitants of houses; so be shy of them, respect them, and honor them. When you enter the water, do not enter except with a waistcloth.\"\nAl-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Abu Bakr al-Sam'ani, may Allah have mercy on him, used to return if he entered the bathhouse and saw a naked person. He mentioned that it is forbidden to sit among those wading in temptation (Fitna).\nIt was narrated from Nafi' from Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he entered the bathhouse wearing a waistcloth. When he arrived, he found them naked. He said: So he turned his face towards the wall then said: Bring me my garment, O Nafi'. I brought it to him, so he wrapped himself in it and covered his face, then handed me his hand. I led him until he exited from it, then he did not enter it after that. It was said to him after that: You cover yourself? He said: I hate to see the Awrah of another.\nFrom Salman al-Farsi, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: To die then be resurrected then die then be resurrected then die, is dearer to me than seeing the Awrah of a man or him seeing it of me. Ibn Umar refrained from entering the bathhouse for this reason.\nAl-Khara'iti supported with chain from Salih al-Dahhan said: Jabir ibn Zayd entered the bathhouse and saw naked people. He said: Glory be to Allah! Are these Muslims? Then he placed his hand over his eyes and left, may Allah be pleased with him and be pleased with us through them. Such was the state of the righteous predecessors, owners of illuminated hearts following the Sunnah; if one of them saw an evil, his heart was disturbed and he fled like a wary animal.\nIn *Shu'ab al-Iman* by Al-Bayhaqi, may Allah have mercy on him, that Ibn al-Mubarak, may Allah be pleased with him, whenever he exited the bathhouse, he prayed two rak'ahs because of what overcame him and what his sight fell upon. And Allah is the Granter of success and the Helper.\n\nChapter\nOn Guarding Against Looking at What Distracts",

    "text": "Al-Nawawi said in *Al-Tibyan*: From that is looking at what distracts and scatters the mind. Uglier than this is looking at what is not permissible to look at, like the beardless boy and others. As for looking at a handsome beardless boy without need, it is forbidden whether with desire or without, whether safe from temptation or not. This is the correct chosen school of thought among scholars. Imam Al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, and uncountable scholars, may Allah be pleased with them all, have stated its prohibition. Its evidence is His Almighty's saying: (Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision). He is like the woman in meaning; rather, perhaps some or many of them are more beautiful than many women. Causes of doubt are possible in him, and paths of evil are easy regarding him which are not easy regarding a woman; so his prohibition was more appropriate. The sayings in driving away from them are more than can be counted.\n\nThe flesh of my face peeled off because of a look!\nIt was narrated from some of the predecessors that he saw one of the dead in sleep whom he believed to be good. He asked him about his condition. He said to him: The flesh of my face peeled off when I stood before Allah Almighty, out of shame before Him, because of a look I cast at a young man.\nAs for looking with desire at anyone, be it man or woman, whether the woman is forbidden (Muharrama) or otherwise, except the wife and the owned slave whom one owns for enjoyment—even our companions said: It is forbidden to look with desire at his Mahrams like his daughter. And Allah knows best.\n\nRuling on boys entering the Mosque:\nAs for the ruling on boys entering the Mosque, our Sheikh said: Al-Baghdadi said: Al-Mutawalli said: It is disliked to bring animals, madmen, and boys who do not discern into the Mosque because their polluting it is not secure. As for teaching them the Quran in the Mosque, if that is in a manner leading to violating its sanctity, lack of respect for it, disturbing the one praying, and spitting in it, it is prevented; otherwise, no. Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, used to read the Quran in the Mosque while kneeling on his knees.\n\nImam Malik's opinion on teaching boys in the Mosque:\nMalik was asked about teaching boys in the Mosque. He said: I do not see that permissible; because Mosques were not built for that. Based on that, boys are prevented from entering Mosques without need, such as if they enter for play and amusement, or their voices are raised and they disrespect the Mosque and the like.\n\nChapter\nOn the Afflictions Entering upon the Poor (Sufis) from Mixing with Youths\n\nAbu al-Faraj, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Know that most of those imitating the Sufis have closed upon themselves the door of looking at foreign women due to their distance from accompanying them and refraining from mixing with them. They busied themselves with asceticism from marriage. Companionship of youths was negated for them on the path of will (*Irada*) and intent of asceticism. So Iblis inclined them towards it. They are in their companionship of seven types:\nFirst: The most malicious of people. They are people imitating Sufis and professing Incarnation (*Hulul*). Abu Nasr Abdullah ibn Ali al-Sarraj said: It reached me that a group of the Incarnationists claimed that the Truth (Allah) chose bodies in which the meanings of Lordship resided.\nSecond Type: A group imitating Sufis in their school and intending passionate love (*Ishq*).\nThird Type: A group permitting looking at the beautiful. Abu Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami wrote a book he named *Sunan al-Sufiyyah*. He said at the end of the book: Chapter on the collections of their licenses. He mentioned in it what was narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"Seek good with the beautiful of faces,\" and that he said: \"Three things clear the eyesight: Looking at greenery, looking at water, and looking at a beautiful face.\" These two Hadiths have no basis from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. As for the first Hadith, Ibn Ma'in said about it: Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Muhib who narrates it from Nafi' from Ibn Umar is nothing. Al-Uqayli said: Nothing is proven from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, in this. As for the second Hadith: It is fabricated, forged by Abu al-Bakhtari. It is the hadith of Wahb ibn Wahb; he narrated it from Al-Rashid when he was addicted to looking at his son. Scholars do not differ that Abu al-Bakhtari is a fabricator and liar, and Ahmad ibn Umar Abd al-Zanjani [is unknown?]. Scholars do not differ that Abu al-Bakhtari is one of the unknown [in credibility? Or meant: notorious liars]. Then he said: It was appropriate for Al-Sulami, if he mentioned looking at the beautiful, to restrict it to looking at the face of the wife or slave-girl. As for generalizing it, then it is equal [in error].\nAbu al-Faraj, may Allah have mercy on him, said: The jurists say: Whoever's desire is aroused when looking at a \"beardless boy\", it is forbidden for him to look at him. Even if it is the habit of teachers for desire to be aroused when looking at a boy, then looking at him is forbidden. Whenever a person claims that his desire is not aroused when looking at a handsome beardless boy, he is a liar.",

    "text": "Fourth Type: A group who say: We do not look with a look of desire, but we look with a look of consideration/lesson (*I'tibar*), and looking does not harm us. This is impossible from them, for natures are equal. So whoever claims his distinction from the sons of his genus in nature claims the impossible as preceded.\nFifth Type: A group who accompanied beardless boys and prevented themselves from immoralities, believing that to be struggling (*Mujahada*). They did not know that the very companionship with them and looking at them with desire is disobedience.\nSixth Type: A group who did not intend companionship of beardless boys. Rather, the boy repents and becomes ascetic and accompanies them on the path of will (*Irada*). So Iblis confuses them and says: Do not prevent him from good. Then their looking at him repeats not by intent, so it stirs temptation in the heart and he wishes until Satan attains the amount possible. Perhaps they trusted in their religion, so Satan provoked them and ascended them to the furthest sins as he did with Barsisa. He made them err from the side of exposing themselves to temptations in the company of one whose company is not safe from temptation.\n\nSupplement transmitted by our Sheikh from Abdullah ibn Ata', may Allah have mercy on him, said: Upon you, O believer, is to lower your gaze when you go out until you return. And let him remember His Almighty's saying: (Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision), the verse. And do not be ungrateful for Allah's blessing, and a trust from Allah is with him so do not be a traitor to Him. And let him remember His Almighty's saying: (Does he not know that Allah sees?). So if you want to see, know that He sees. Let the servant know that if he lowers his gaze, Allah opens his insight (*Basirah*) as a recompense in accordance. Whoever restricts himself in the circle of the witnessed world, Allah expands for him in the circle of the Unseen. He said: No one lowered his gaze from the prohibitions of Allah but that Allah created a light in his heart finding the sweetness of that.\n\nSeventh Type: A group who knew that accompanying beardless boys and looking at them is not permissible, but they did not have patience from that. Abu Bakr al-Razi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: I heard Yusuf ibn al-Husayn say: Everything you see me doing, do it, except accompanying youths (*Ahdath*), for it is the most tempting of temptations. I have covenanted with my Lord more than a hundred times not to accompany a youth.\n\nChapter\nOn Refuting a Sect of People and Exposing their Scandals\n\nIbn al-Hajj said in *Al-Madkhal*: Companionship of beardless boys may be attributed to a sect of people, and perhaps they adorned them with jewelry and dyed clothes, and claim they intend by that inferring the Maker from the made thing. The master Sheikh Al-Qushayri said a great saying in refuting them and exposing their scandals. He said: Whoever Allah afflicts with something of that, he is a servant whom Allah has humiliated and forsaken, and exposed his private parts and revealed his evil in the immediate [world], and he has with Allah Almighty an evil return in the Hereafter.\nAl-Wasiti, who is one of the senior Sufis, said: If Allah wants the humiliation of a servant, He throws him to these stinking carcasses. Have they not heard His Almighty's saying: (Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts. That is purer for them). Ata' said: Every look which the heart desires has no good in it.\n\nChapter\nOn the Plots of Satan",

    "text": "He said: Among his plots and traps is what he tempted lovers of images with. That, by my life, by Allah, is the \"Great Trial\" and the grand calamity which enslaved souls to other than their Creator, and possessed souls for those who impose humiliation upon them among their lovers. It cast war between passionate love (*Ishq*) and Monotheism (*Tawhid*), and called to the allegiance of every rebellious devil. So it made the heart a prisoner to desire, and made it [desire] a ruler and prince over it. It filled hearts with temptation and filled them with ordeal, stood between them and their guidance, and diverted them from the path of their goal. It called upon them in the slave market, so it sold them for the cheapest prices, and compensated them with the vilest fortunes and lowest demands instead of high ranks in the chambers of Gardens, let alone what is above that of nearness to the Most Merciful. So [the soul] settled to that vile, base beloved, fear of whom is multiples of its pleasure, and reaching whom is the biggest cause of its harm; including that he may soon turn from a beloved into an enemy, and disown him out of love until it is as if he was never a beloved to him. If he enjoys him in this abode, he will find through him the greatest pain after a while, especially when (Close friends, that Day, will be enemies to each other, except for the righteous). So oh regret of the lover who sold himself to other than the First Beloved for a cheap price, and a fleeting desire whose pleasure went and its consequence remained, and its benefit ended and its harm remained. So the desire went and the misery remained, and the joy vanished and the harm remained. So oh regret for a lover for whom two regrets were combined: regret of missing the Highest Beloved and eternal bliss, and regret of what he endures of fatigue in the painful punishment. There the deceived one knows what merchandise he wasted, and that the one who owned the slavery of his heart was not fit to be for him among the servants and followers. So what calamity is greater than the calamity of a king who stepped down from the throne of his kingdom, and made himself a prisoner to one not fit to be his slave, and was made conquered under his commands and prohibitions? If you saw his heart while in the hand of his beloved, you would see it like a sparrow in the hand of a child subjecting it to the thickets of death while the child amuses himself or plays. Does it befit the rational person to follow this obeyed king for one who imposes evil punishment upon him, and places the greatest veil between him and his Guardian and true Master, whom he cannot do without and must have? For the lover is a slain victim for the one he loves, and he is a humble, abject slave to him. If he calls him, he answers him. If he is told what do you wish, he is the utmost of what he wishes. He finds no intimacy with other than him, and finds no rest with anyone else. So it is worthy for him that no one owns his slavery except the Beloved [Allah], and that he not sell his portion except for the best portion.\nThen he said: Among beneficial love is the love of the wife and what the right hand of a man possesses. For it helps in what was legislated for him of marriage and ownership of the right hand in keeping the man and his family chaste, so her soul does not aspire to another. The more complete and stronger the love between the spouses, the more complete and perfect this objective is. Allah Almighty said: (It is He who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he might dwell in security with her). And He Almighty said: (And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy).",

    "text": "In the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked: Who is the most beloved of people to you? He said: \"Aisha,\" may Allah be pleased with her. For this reason, Masruq, may Allah be pleased with him, when narrating from her, used to say: The Truthful woman (*Siddiqa*), daughter of the Truthful man (*Siddiq*), the beloved of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, the one exonerated from above seven heavens, narrated to me.\nIt is authentically reported from him, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"Made beloved to me from your world are women and perfume, and the coolness of my eye was made in prayer.\"\nSo there is no blame on a man in his love for his wife and his passion (*Ishq*) for her, unless that distracts him from what is more beneficial for him of the love of Allah and His Messenger, such that it lowers and decreases it; then it is blameworthy.\nKnow that beneficial love is three types: Love of Allah, love for the sake of Allah, and love of what helps in obeying Allah. And love of what cuts off from the love of Allah and decreases it [is blameworthy].\nLove of Allah is the basis of praiseworthy loves and the basis of faith and Tawhid. The other two types follow it. And love *with* Allah is the basis of Shirk and blameworthy loves. The other two types [of blameworthy love?] follow it. Love of forbidden images and passion for them is among the causes of Shirk. Ibn al-Qayyim said this in his speech on forbidden passion (*Ishq*). He said: And a passion which is abhorrence from Allah and distance from His mercy, and it is the most harmful thing to a servant in his religion and world, is the passion for \"beardless boys\" (*Murdan*). Just as Allah tested with it those who fell from His eye, were expelled from His door, and whose hearts He distanced from Him. It is among the greatest veils cutting off from Allah Almighty, as some of the predecessors said: If a servant falls from the eye of Allah, He tests him with the love of beardless boys. This love which brought upon the people of Lot what it brought; they only came [to destruction] from this passion. Allah Almighty said: (Indeed, they are in their intoxication, wandering blindly).\nThe cure for this destructive disease is seeking help from the Turner of hearts, sincerity in resorting to Him, occupying oneself with His remembrance, exposing oneself to His love and nearness, and considering the pain that follows this passion and the pleasure that seduces him causing him to miss the greatest beloved and obtain the greatest disliked thing. If his soul proceeds to this or prefers it, let him say the funeral Takbir over it, and know that calamity has surrounded it. We seek refuge in Allah from this disease.\nThe further one is from sincerity (*Ikhlas*), the stronger his love for the passion of images. The more sincere and stronger in Tawhid he is, the further he is from the passion of images. For this reason, the wife of Al-Aziz was afflicted with what she was afflicted with of passion due to her Shirk, and Yusuf the Truthful, peace be upon him, was saved by his sincerity. Allah Almighty said: (Thus [it was] that We might turn away from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen/sincere servants). Evil is passion, and immorality is adultery. So the sincere one is he who made his love pure for Allah, so He saved him from the temptation of the passion of images. The polytheist whose heart is attached to other than Allah did not purify his Tawhid and love for Allah.\n\nChapter\nOn Whoever Wants to Marry\n\nIf you want to marry, you must seek a righteous woman, and a worshipper is better. Know that marriage is recommended for one who needs it. The basis for its legitimacy is the Book, the Sunnah, and the consensus of the Nation. Allah Almighty said: (And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves). He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"O assembly of youth, whoever among you is able to marry (*Ba'ah*), let him marry, for it is more lowering for the gaze and more guarding for the private part. And whoever is not able, let him fast, for fasting is a shield (*Wija'*) for him,\" meaning cutting off desire.\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever marries a woman for her wealth, Allah Almighty impoverishes him. Whoever marries a woman for her beauty, Allah makes her beauty a curse upon him. Whoever marries a woman for her religion, it is blessed for him and upon him.\"\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Do not marry women for their beauty, for perhaps their beauty will destroy them. And do not marry them for their wealth, for perhaps their wealth will make them tyrannical. But marry them for religion.\"\nFrom Abdullah ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The world is but enjoyment, and there is nothing of the enjoyment of the world better than a righteous woman.\"\nSo if you resolve to propose to a woman, choose. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Choose for your sperm.\"\nFrom Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Seek compatible places for your sperm, for the child often resembles his maternal uncles.\"\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Beware of the green manure (*Khadra' al-Diman*).\" It was said: What is the green manure, O Messenger of Allah? He said: \"The beautiful woman in a bad growing place (environment).\"\nIt was narrated from Yahya ibn Sa'id ibn Dinar, may Allah be pleased with him, from Abu Wajrah Yazid ibn Ubayd from Ata' ibn Yazid from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said that. Abu Ubaydah said: He meant corruption of lineage if it is feared she is from other than a rightly-guided woman. He only called her green manure likening her to a lush tree in the dung of a camel. The origin of *Diman* is what camels and sheep accumulate of their droppings and urine, so perhaps good plants grow in it. Its root is from *damnatha* (dunging it). He says: Her appearance is beautiful and elegant, but her origin is corrupt.",

    "text": "\"Notice\": Al-Nawawi said in *Sharh Muslim*: The meaning of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, \"whoever among you is able\" [means] intercourse due to his ability for its costs, which are the costs of marriage, let him marry. And whoever is unable to have intercourse due to his inability for its costs, upon him is fasting, for it cuts his desire and cuts the evil of his *Mass* (touch/desire) just as castration (*Wija'*) cuts it. This saying directs the address to youths who are a locus of desire for women and are usually not free from it.\nThe second opinion: That the intended meaning here by *Ba'ah* is the costs of marriage, named by the name of what accompanies it. Its estimation is: Whoever among you is capable of the costs of marriage, let him marry. And whoever is not able, let him fast to repel desire. What led those who say this is that they said: His saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"And whoever is not able, upon him is fasting,\" and the one incapable of intercourse does not need fasting to repel desire, so interpreting *Ba'ah* as costs became necessary.\nAs for *Wija'* with Kasra on Waw and Madd, it is crushing the testicles. It is a matter of recommendation, not obligation; so marriage and taking concubines is not obligatory upon him whether [he fears] temptation or not. This is the school of all scholars, and we do not know anyone who obligated it except Dawud and those who agreed with him from the Literalists (*Ahl al-Zahir*). And a narration from Ahmad says: It is only obligatory upon him once in a lifetime. This is the end of Al-Nawawi's words.\n\nChapter\nOn the One for Whom Marriage is Disliked\n\nAl-Husni said in the explanation of Abu Shuja' regarding the one who is not yearning, and he has two states:\nFirst: That he does not find the provision for marriage. Marriage is disliked for him due to the commitment to what he cannot fulfill without necessity. In his saying: \"O assembly of youth\" is a reference to the like of that.\nSecond State: That he finds the cost of marriage but does not need it, either due to his inability by being *Majbub* (penis cut) or impotent (*Unnah*), or having a permanent illness and the like. This is also disliked for him. If he has no ailment and finds the provision, marriage is not disliked for him. Yes, freeing oneself for worship is better; if he is not occupied with worship, what is better for him? There is a disagreement; the preponderant view is that marriage is better lest idleness and free time lead him to immoralities. End of Sheikh Taqi al-Din al-Husni's words.\n\nRecommendation of looking at the fiancee before the contract:\nKnow that if a man resolves to marry a woman, it is recommended for him to look at her before the contract. As for the amount he looks at, the school of Al-Shafi'i and the majority of scholars is that he looks at her face and hands. If he is unable to look, he sends a righteous, pious woman to look at her and describe her to him.\n\nChapter\nOn the Prophet's Saying: \"Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me\"\n\nRegarding his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me,\" Al-Nawawi said in *Sharh Muslim*: Its interpretation is that its meaning is: Whoever leaves it turning away from it, not believing in it as it is. As for whoever leaves marriage in the manner where leaving it is recommended for him as preceded, or leaves sleeping on the bed due to his inability for it or his occupation with permitted worship or the like, this censure and prohibition do not apply to him. He said: And the meaning of their saying \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, rejected Uthman ibn Maz'un's celibacy (*Tabattul*)\" means: \"He forbade him from it.\" This, according to our companions, is interpreted as applicable to one whose soul yearns for marriage and finds its cost as preceded also, and one whom difficult acts of worship harm. As for turning away from desires and pleasures without harming oneself or missing a right of a wife or other, it is a virtue; there is no prevention from it, rather it is commanded. Al-Nawawi mentioned that in *Sharh Muslim*.\n\nChapter\nOn What is Forbidden for Men Regarding Women\n\nSheikh Taqi al-Din said: The women forbidden by text are fourteen: by lineage, two by breastfeeding, four by in-law relationship, and one by way of combining. The generality of His Almighty's saying gathers all: (Prohibited to you are your mothers) to His saying: (and that you combine two sisters) the verse. Its explanation is in the book of Fiqh; this summary does not bear it.\n\nChapter\nOn the Recommendation for One Who Sees a Woman and She Affects Him to Go to his Wife or Slave-girl and Have Intercourse with Her\n\nThe woman in her coming and going!",

    "text": "He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed the woman comes in the image of a devil and goes in the image of a devil. So if one of you sees a woman, let him go to his family, for that repels what is in his soul.\"\nIn another narration: \"If a woman pleases one of you and falls into his heart, let him go to his wife and have intercourse with her, for that repels what is in his soul.\"\nThis second narration affirms the first. The meaning of the Hadith: It is recommended for one who sees a woman and she stirs his desire, to go to his wife or slave-girl if he has one, and have intercourse with her to repel his desire, calm his soul, and gather his heart on what he is about.\nHis saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Indeed the woman comes in the image of a devil and goes in the image of a devil.\" Scholars said: The meaning is pointing to desire and inviting to temptation by her beauty, due to what Allah Almighty placed in the souls of men of inclination towards women by finding pleasure in looking at them and what relates to them. So she is likened to Satan in his calling to evil by his whispering and adornment. It is deduced from this that it is appropriate for a man to lower his gaze from seeing her and turn away from her absolutely. Al-Nawawi also mentioned it.\n\n\"Notice\" On the Prohibition of Imagining the Image of a Foreign Woman During Intercourse\nBeware, O my brother, if something of that happens to you, i.e., you looked at a woman then returned to your family, that it happens to you during intercourse that you imagine the woman you saw as if she is your wife, until you witness her with your heart while you are having intercourse with your wife as if you are having intercourse with that woman you saw. That is forbidden, and it is from the plots of Satan. I heard it from our Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him.\n\nClarification of What is Done in Marriage Contracts Contrary to the Sunnah\nOur Sheikh said: Among them is excess in the dowry (*Sadaq*) of the woman. From Al-Ju'fi, he said: Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, addressed us saying: \"Do not go to extremes in the dowries of women. For if it were an honor or piety before Allah Almighty, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would have been the first of you to do it. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, did not give a dowry to any of his wives nor was any of his daughters given a dowry more than twelve Uqiyyahs.\" In the Hadith of Uqbah \"and a Nash\". Meaning: half an Uqiyyah. The Uqiyyah is forty Dirhams. There is no limit to its maximum provided he is capable of paying it, that he is not a fornicator, and that he intends to pay it according to what the Sunnah reported in hadiths. They only differed on its minimum, and its minimum is not estimated by anything as reported when some Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, were asked about a woman the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, married: What did he give her as dowry? He said: \"The weight of a date stone of gold.\"\n\nMinimum Dowry according to Abu Hanifa and Malik:\nAbu Hanifa and Malik said: Its minimum is what warrants cutting the hand of a thief. And Allah knows best.\nAl-Husni said in *Al-Sharh*: Branch: It is forbidden for the husband to cohabit with the woman in Iddah (waiting period) in the house in which she observes Iddah, and entering upon her leads to seclusion, and his seclusion with her is like the seclusion of a foreign woman. Many ignorant people do not see that as forbidden and say: She is my divorcee. This one [should be] informed of the situation; if he believes it permissible after knowing, he disbelieves. If he repents, [good], otherwise his neck is struck. Likewise the ruling of camel-litters attendants (*Akkamin*) who perform Hajj with women; it is not lawful for them to be alone with them. One should not emulate those among the pseudo-jurists who do this, for that is forbidden, forbidden, forbidden.\nAs for what was reported of the rulings of marriage, its Sunnahs, etiquettes, impediments, and harms: This summary does not bear it. If you need it, seek it in the detailed books of scholars. And Allah is the One sought for help.\n\nChapter\nOn the Plots of Satan and His Mockery of Those Tempted by Images\nAmong the plots of Satan and his mockery of those tempted by images is that one of them wishes/claims that he only loves that beardless boy or that foreign woman for the sake of Allah, not for immorality, and he orders him to fraternize with him. This is of the genus of taking secret lovers (*Mukhadanah*); rather it is a false taking of secret lovers with young boys (*Ahdath*), about whom Allah Almighty said concerning women: (Chaste, not committing unlawful intercourse and not taking secret lovers). And He said regarding men: (Chaste, not committing unlawful intercourse and not taking secret lovers).",

    "text": "So they show people that their love for those images is for Allah, and they think taking them as intimates, enjoying them by action or kissing, or enjoying merely by looking, taking as secret lovers, and consorting—and their belief that this is for Allah and that it is an act of closeness and obedience—is among the greatest error, misguidance, and altering of religion. That is of the type of Shirk, and love taken as an idol besides Allah. For their belief that the enjoyment of love, looking, taking as secret lovers, and some touching is for Allah, and that it is love in Him, is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk like the belief of idol lovers in their idols.\nThe Sheikh said: Oh wonder, by Allah, at the ruin of these hearts and their heedlessness of the Knower of the Unseen. Hearts occupied with the love of women and beardless boys, and turned away from the love of the Merciful, the Compassionate. That is only because they were filled with desires and darkened by eating Haram and doubtful things, so they became such that they do not see the evil as ugly nor the good as beautiful. O Allah, reform their corruption, straighten their building, drag them to You with the chains of turning [to You], and occupy them with righteous deeds.\n\n\"Subtle Point\"\nKnow that whoever loves persons and enables their love in his heart, the image of that person becomes fixed in his heart, witnessing it with his inner secret. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.\" If this is regarding houses belonging to creatures made by their hands, what do you think of the heart of the believing servant which is the place of the Lord's gaze, Glorified and Exalted?\n\nHearts are Allah's Vessels on Earth!\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said in the Divine Hadith: \"My earth and My heaven did not contain Me, but the heart of My believing servant contained Me.\" And his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Indeed Allah has vessels in His earth; behold, they are the hearts.\" So beware that He looks at your heart and finds a place for other than Him, so He loathes you for that. We seek refuge in Allah from a distracter that occupies hearts and tires eyes.\n\nChapter\nOn Adultery (Zina)\n\nOur Sheikh Abu al-Abbas Ahmad al-Zahid, may Allah have mercy on him, said: As for adultery, Allah Almighty said: (And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse). He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The adulterer does not commit adultery while he is a believer.\"\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"If a man commits adultery, faith exits from him and is over him like a canopy. If he ceases from it, faith returns to him.\"\nIt was narrated from him, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Whoever commits adultery or drinks wine, Allah removes faith from him just as a person takes off a shirt from his head. If he repents and returns, it returns to him.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Adultery bequeaths poverty.\" In a report: \"The adulterer dies poor and the one who sodomizes (*Mu'allaf*?) dies blind.\"\nAbu Umamah narrated: That a young boy came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: Do you permit me to commit adultery? The people shouted at him. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Bring him near, bring him near. He said: Come close to me. So he came close to him. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Do you like it for your mother? He said: No, may Allah make me your ransom. He said: Likewise people do not like it for their mothers. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Do you like it for your daughter? He said: No. He said: Likewise people do not like it for their daughters. Until he mentioned the sister, the paternal aunt, and the maternal aunt, saying: Likewise people do not like it. Then he placed his hand on his chest and said: O Allah, purify him, forgive his sin, and guard his private part. So there was nothing more hateful to him after that than adultery.\"\nIn the Hadith: \"There is no sin after Shirk with Allah greater than a drop [semen] a man places in a womb that is not lawful for him.\"\n\nO Assembly of Muslims, Beware of Adultery!\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"O assembly of Muslims, beware of adultery, for in it are six qualities: three in the world and three in the Hereafter. As for those in the world: Loss of brightness [of face], lasting poverty, and shortening of life. As for those in the Hereafter: The wrath of Allah, bad reckoning, and eternity in the Fire if he does not repent.\" We seek refuge in Allah from that.\n\nBe Chaste, Your Women Will Be Chaste!\nSo upon you, O my brother, is chastity, as the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Be chaste, your women will be chaste. Be righteous to your fathers, your sons will be righteous to you. Whoever his brother comes to him apologizing, let him accept that from him, whether he was right or wrong.\" It was said:\n*Be chaste, your women will be chaste regarding the forbidden ... and avoid what does not befit a Muslim.*\n*Indeed adultery is a debt; if you lend it ... the repayment will be from your family, so know.*\n*O violator of the harems of men and cutter ... of the paths of affection, you lived without honor.*\n*If you were free from the lineage of Adam ... you would not be a violator of the sanctity of Adam.*\n\nAs You Judge, You Shall Be Judged!",

    "text": "So beware of that, O my brother, for the recompense is of the same nature as the deed; as you judge/do, you shall be judged/done to. Among its consequences is the wrath of the Lord. Among its evils is blackness of the face, darkness, and gloom due to the loathing that appears on him to onlookers, darkness of the grave, extinguishing of its light, persistence of poverty, stripping him of the name 'Believer', and exposing himself to dwelling in the Oven (*Tannur*) in which the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, saw the adulterers. The goodness (*Tayyib*) with which the people of chastity are described departs from him, and is replaced by the evil (*Khabith*) with which adulterers are described. Allah Almighty said: (Good women are for good men) to His saying: (Evil women are for evil men), the verse. Allah has forbidden Paradise to every evil person; rather He made it the abode of the good. Allah Almighty said: (Those whom the angels take in death while they are good and pure; [the angels] will say, \"Peace be upon you. Enter Paradise for what you used to do\").\n\nDesolation of Face and Heart are from the Evils of Adultery!!\nAmong its evils: Desolation on his face and in his heart. Whoever sits with him feels desolate from him. The chaste person has sweetness on his face and intimacy in his heart; whoever sits with him finds comfort in him.\nEvils of Adultery! Know that a man's adultery causes mixing of lineages, corruption of the protected woman, and exposing her to ruin and corruption. In this major sin is the destruction of the world and the Hereafter. How many prohibitions are made lawful in adultery, rights missed, and injustices occurred.\n\nAdultery is a greater corruption than killing!\nAmong its properties is that it causes poverty, shortens life, clothes its doer in blackness of face, and causes loathing among people. There is no corruption after the corruption of killing greater than its corruption. For this reason, killing was legislated in it in the most heinous, ugly, and difficult ways. If a servant were to hear that his wife or female relative was killed, it would be easier for him than hearing that she committed adultery.\nSa'd ibn Ubadah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: If I saw anyone with my wife, I would strike him with the sword not using the flat side. That reached the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, so he said: \"Do you marvel at Sa'd's jealousy? By Allah, I am more jealous than him, and Allah is more jealous than me. Because of Allah's jealousy, Allah forbade immoralities, what is apparent of them and what is concealed.\" Agreed upon.\nIn the two Sahihs also from him, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Indeed Allah Almighty becomes jealous, and indeed the believer becomes jealous. Allah's jealousy is that the servant commits what Allah has forbidden him.\"\nIn the Sahih from him, peace and blessings be upon him: \"No one is more jealous than Allah; because of that He forbade immoralities, what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And no one loves praise more than Allah; because of that He praised Himself.\"\n\nThe Ugliest and Most Hideous Adultery!\nAmong the ugliest and most hideous adultery is a man's adultery with his neighbor's wife. In the Hadith: \"To commit adultery with ten women is lighter for him than to commit adultery with his neighbor's wife.\"\n\nThe Greatest Prohibitions:\nAmong the greatest prohibitions is to have intercourse with women in their anuses. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Cursed is he who comes to his wife in her anus.\" He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"That is the lesser sodomy.\" He said: \"Whoever marries a woman in her anus, or a man, or a boy, will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection smelling worse than a carcass, people will be harmed by him until he enters the Fire. Allah nullifies his reward, and Allah does not accept from them any exchange or ransom. He enters a coffin of fire and it is nailed shut upon him with nails of fire if he does not repent.\"\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Those who do not smell the scent of Paradise: The lying scholar, the stingy rich man, the corrupt old man, the adulterous youth, and the ignorant ascetic.\"\nAmong the ugliest adultery is with a foreign woman who has a husband, and with Mahrams. Adultery of a previously married person (*Thayyib*) is uglier than adultery of a virgin. Adultery of an old man is uglier than adultery of a youth. Adultery of a free man is uglier than adultery of a slave. Adultery of a scholar is uglier than adultery of an ignorant person. Adultery of a righteous person is uglier than adultery of a wrongdoer. Among the greatest exaggeration and severity in adultery is where He made Shirk conjoined with adultery. Allah Almighty commanded in the verse: The adulteress and the adulterer, lash each one of them a hundred lashes if they are virgins, not married (*Muhsan*). The Sunnah came with an addition to that, which is exile for a year. As for the Thayyib with the Thayyib, in the Hadith: \"The virgin with the virgin, lashing of a hundred and exile for a year. And the Thayyib, lashing of a hundred and stoning with stones,\" meaning until he dies. If he marries, he becomes Muhsan, even if his wife died or he divorced her. This is the state of adultery with women.\n\nChapter\nOn the Corruption of Sodomy (*Liwat*) and its Punishment",

    "text": "Since sodomy is more sinful and uglier in obscenity, and its corruption is among the greatest corruptions, its punishment in the world and Hereafter was among the ugliest punishments. It is greater with Allah than adultery with women, which is adultery with males. This is the ugliest of the ugly, and the most obscene of obscenities. Allah Almighty informed in the Quran about the story of the people of Lot, and the magnitude of their calamity as He Almighty said: (Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women), the verse.\nIbn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Allah, Glorified and Exalted, did not test anyone of the worlds with this major sin before the people of Lot. He punished them with a punishment He did not punish any nation with other than them. He combined upon them types of punishments: destruction, turning their dwellings upside down upon them, sinking them into the earth, and stoning them with stones from the sky. He made an example of them as He did not make of any nation other than them. That is due to the greatness of the corruption of this crime, from which the earth almost sways from its sides if it is committed upon it, and the angels flee to the regions of the heavens and earth if they witness it, fearing the descent of punishment upon its people, lest it strike them with them. The earth cries out to its Lord, Blessed and Exalted, and the mountains almost move from their places.\nIt was said: Killing the passive partner (*Maf'ul bihi*) is better for him than having intercourse with him; for if the man has intercourse with him, he has killed him a killing with which no life is hoped; unlike killing him [physically], for he is a wronged martyr, and he only benefits from it in his Hereafter. They said the evidence for this is: That Allah, Glorified and Exalted, made the penalty of the killer up to the choice of the guardian; if he wishes he kills, and if he wishes he pardons. But He made the killing of the sodomite mandatory as a Hadd punishment, as agreed upon by the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, and indicated by the authentic, explicit Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, which has no contradiction; rather, upon it was the action of his Companions and his Rightly Guided Caliphs, may Allah be pleased with them.\nIbn al-Qayyim also said, may Allah have mercy on him: It is upon every rational person not to walk a path until he knows its safety and its harms, and what that path leads him to of safety or ruin. These two paths [adultery and sodomy] are the destruction of the first and the last people. In them are perils and dooms, and they lead their companion to the ugliest ends and worst resources of destruction. For this reason, Allah, Glorified and Exalted, made the path of adultery an evil path. He Almighty said: (And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way). If this is the path of adultery, then how about the path of sodomy, where one act of it equals multiples and multiples of multiples of adultery in sin and punishment?\n\nThe Path of Adultery is the Worst Path\nAs for the path of adultery, it is the worst path, and the resting place of its people in Hellfire is the worst resting place. The settlement of their souls in the Barzakh (Interspace) is in an oven of fire, its flames coming to them from beneath them. If the flames come to them, they cry out and rise, then return to their places. They are like this until the Day of Resurrection, as the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, saw in his dream, and the vision of Prophets is truth in which there is no doubt. He said regarding the matter of the oven: There were naked men and women in it, and flames were coming to them from below them. When that flame came to them, they clamored. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Then I said: Who are these?\" They said: As for the naked men and women who are in the structure like an oven, they are the adulterers and adulteresses. So adultery is greater than drinking wine.\nThe majestic Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said: There is nothing after killing a soul greater than adultery. Adultery gathers all traits of Shirk: lack of religion, loss of piety, corruption of chivalry (*Muru'ah*), and lack of jealousy (*Ghayrah*). You do not find an adulterer with piety, nor fulfillment of covenant, nor truthfulness in speech, nor maintaining a friend, nor complete jealousy for his family. Treachery, lying, betrayal, lack of shame, lack of pride for the harem, and loss of jealousy from the heart are from its branches.\n\nAppearance of Adultery is among the Signs of the Hour and Destruction of the World:\nKnow that the appearance of adultery is among the signs of the destruction of the world and it is one of the signs of the Hour, as in the two Sahihs from Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: \"Shall I not tell you a hadith that no one after me will tell you? I heard it from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, saying: 'Among the signs of the Hour is that knowledge will be lifted, ignorance will appear, adultery will spread, men will decrease and women will increase until there will be one guardian for fifty women.'\" It has been the way (*Sunnah*) of Allah, Glorified and Exalted, in His creation that upon the appearance of adultery, Allah, Glorified and Exalted, becomes angry with His severest anger. His anger must affect the earth as a punishment.\nAbdullah ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Adultery does not appear in a town except that Allah permits its destruction. Some rabbis of Banu Israel saw a son of his winking at a woman, so he said: Gently, O my son. So the father fell from his bed, his spinal cord broke, and his wife miscarried. It was said to him: Is this how you got angry for Me?\n\nChapter\nOn Whoever Solicits a Boy or Comes to Him\nAbdullah ibn al-Mubarak permitted for the boy, if immorality is sought from him and nothing saves him but killing, to kill the one soliciting him.\nIbn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, said: This is what the Sunnah implies, because if it is permissible for him to fight for a dirham of his money, then killing the one forcing him regarding himself is more appropriate, even if it leads to killing him.\nIbn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, said: This is consistent with the principles of Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, and others of the Imams.\nYazid ibn Harun, may Allah have mercy on him, was asked about sodomites, so he said: The one who comes to the boy between his thighs is the sodomite upon whom is the Hadd punishment. And the one who comes to him in his anus is a disbeliever.\nMujahid said: Abu Huraira - may Allah be pleased with him - said: Whoever comes to a boy has disbelieved - and in another narration from him: Whoever comes to men or women in their anuses has disbelieved.\nFrom Abu Dharr - may Allah be pleased with him -: Whoever comes to men or women in their anuses has disbelieved.",

    "text": "And other than that from the beardless boy and the woman. As for hearing singing from a foreign woman and a beardless boy, it is among the greatest prohibitions and most severe corruption in religion.\nAl-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, said: The owner of the slave-girl, if he gathers people to hear her, is a fool whose testimony is rejected. He was harsh in speech regarding him, then said: It is cuckoldry (*Diyathah*); whoever does that is a cuckold (*Dayyuth*). Qadi Abu al-Tayyib said: He only made her owner a fool because he called people to falsehood, and whoever calls people to falsehood is a fool.\nKnow that hearing singing from a foreign woman and a beardless boy excites sexual desire (*Bah*). Some were asked about the cause that excites; he said: Singing from a bad character, and speech from a beautiful face.\nAbdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: I asked my father about singing. He said: Singing grows hypocrisy in the heart; then he mentioned Malik's saying: Only the dissolute (*Fussaq*) do it among us.\nSome scholars chose that a person should not hear Quran recitation from a beardless boy. The righteous predecessors, may Allah have mercy on them, if one of them passed by a handsome beardless boy, he would flee from him like his fleeing from a lion, out of fear for himself from temptation. So do not expose yourself, O rational one, to this trial.\nA slave-girl asked Bishr al-Hafi about the gate of Harb, so he answered her. Then she came after that with a handsome boy and he asked him. Bishr lowered his head. The boy repeated the question, so the Sheikh closed his eyes. The poor [Sufis] said to the boy: The door is before you. When the youth disappeared, the Sheikh opened his eyes. The poor said to the Sheikh: O Abu Nasr, a slave-girl came to you and you spoke to her and answered her, and a boy came to you and you did not speak to him? He said: It was narrated from Sufyan al-Thawri, may Allah have mercy on him, that he said: If a woman approaches, a devil approaches with her. And if a beardless boy approaches, two devils approach with him. So I feared for myself from his two devils.\nAl-Junayd, may Allah have mercy on him, said: A man entered upon Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him. The entrant was one of the leaders of the people, and with him was his son, who was handsome of face and appearance. Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, said to him: Do not bring him with you another time.\nHe said: Usama, may Allah have mercy on him, said: We were reading to a Sheikh, and a boy remained with him reading to him. I wanted to stand up, so he took my hand and said: Be patient until this boy reads. He disliked being alone with him.\nAbu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy on him, used to seat Muhammad ibn al-Hasan behind him then teach him, out of fear of temptation and following the Sunnah. For it was reported that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, made a beardless boy stand up from before him and seated him behind him.\n\nNot letting boys go out to places of corruption is from the Sunnah\nFrom the Sunnah is that a man not enable his child, if he is a boy, to display himself and go out to places from which temptation is feared, out of fear of corruption and distracting the hearts of servants. He should not enable him to mix with men, nor send him with the dissolute to the bathhouse, nor let him sit with the people of rowdiness and the common folk. This is the speech of our Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him.\n\nRuling on Masturbation:\n\"Issue\" Masturbation is a major sin. He will come on the Day of Resurrection with his hand pregnant. So fear Allah, O my brother. May Allah save us and you.\n\"Issue\" *Salj* (?) is forbidden. If a person masturbates with his hand, he is punished (*Ta'zir*); because it is a forbidden touching without penetration, and leads to cutting off offspring, so it is forbidden like touching a foreign woman below the private part. It has come: \"Cursed is he who marries his hand.\"\n\nMasturbation Invalidates Fasting\n\"Issue\" If he masturbates and ejaculates, if he is fasting, his fast is invalidated because it is ejaculation from touching, and it is like ejaculation from the act [of intercourse]. And because masturbation is like touching below the private part of a foreign woman in sin and Ta'zir, and likewise in breaking the fast. Whoever masturbates owes makeup (*Qada*).\nSheikh Shihab al-Din ibn al-Salah said in a fatwa he gave: Masturbation with the hand is forbidden, and with a piece of meat is more severe and uglier. A woman's masturbation by inserting something into her vagina is forbidden. All of that is disobedience necessitating Ta'zir on its doer. Yes, if a man masturbates with the hand of his wife or slave-girl, it is lawful because it is part of the permitted enjoyment. He has the right to enjoyment and penetration in all folds of her body except the anal ring, and except between the navel and knee during menstruation days specifically.\nAs for the boy who inserts something into his anus, it is obligatory on his guardian to hasten to prevent him by beating and otherwise. It is forbidden for him to neglect that and remain silent about it. The guardian sins by his overlooking and silence about it. End.\n\"Issue\" Ibn al-Qayyim said: As for bestiality (intercourse with an animal), the jurists have three opinions on it:",

    "text": "First: That he is disciplined (*yu'addab*) and there is no Hadd punishment on him. This is the opinion of Malik, Abu Hanifa, Al-Shafi'i in one of his two opinions, and the opinion of Ishaq.\nThe Second Opinion: His ruling is the ruling of the adulterer; he is lashed if he is a virgin, and stoned if he is Muhsan (married). This is the opinion of Al-Hasan.\nThe Third Opinion: That his ruling is the ruling of the sodomite. Imam Ahmad, may Allah be pleased with him, stated this textually. It diverges on the two narrations regarding his punishment: Is it killing definitively or like an adulterer?\nThose who said: \"His punishment is the punishment of killing\" argued with what Ibn Dawood narrated from the Hadith of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Whoever comes to an animal, kill him and kill it with him.\" They said: And because it is intercourse not permitted in any case, so killing was the Hadd for the intercourse. Those who did not see a Hadd upon him said: The Hadith in it is not authentic; had it been authentic, we would have upheld it, and it would not have been lawful for us to oppose it.\nIsmail ibn Sa'id al-Shalanji said: I asked Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal about the one who comes to an animal? He paused at it. The Hadith of Amr ibn Abi Amr regarding that is not proven.\nAl-Tahawi said: The Hadith is weak. Also, it is from the narration of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, and he gave a fatwa that there is no Hadd upon him. Abu Dawood said: This weakens the Hadith. There is no doubt that the natural deterrent from coming to an animal is stronger than the natural deterrent from sodomy. The two matters are not equal in people's natures as preceded; so appending one to the other is among the most corrupt analogies.\n\nChapter\nOn the Afflictions of the Beardless Boy\nSidi Abd al-Aziz al-Dirini, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his summary of Al-Qushayri's Risalah: Among the greatest afflictions for the beardless boy is that he attaches his heart to the love of a creature, for that is among the greatest distractions. One seeks help for safety from that by minimizing mixing with people, especially those towards whom souls incline due to beauty or benevolence.\nSidi Fath al-Mawsili said: I accompanied thirty Sheikhs—may Allah have mercy on them—who were counted among the Abdal. All of them advised me upon my parting from them and said: Beware the companionship of youths.\nThe verification in this issue is that whoever thinks it likely that if he accompanies youths he will incline towards them with forbidden desire, it is forbidden for him to accompany them. If he accompanies them for a forbidden purpose, it is a major sin. If he accompanies them while having an inclination towards them but he rebukes himself, he is a mixer who combined good deeds and bad deeds. The believer is pleased by the good deed and sees it from Allah Almighty, and the sin grieves him and he asks Allah for forgiveness from it.\nAs for the one who loves youths and witnesses their beauty, and sees that increasing his expansion with Allah and witnessing the beauty of Allah, this is what they counted as Shirk and Kufr. Whoever is safe from the temptation of loving youths, his heart's attachment to them and intimacy with them is a distracter of the heart. For this reason, they used to forbid the companionship of youths.\nAs for the one who is safe from the attachment of the heart to them, and accompanies them for the sake of Allah Almighty, guides them, teaches them, and disciplines them, he has a great reward. The benefit of this is not hidden. The young have never ceased benefiting from the companionship of the elders in every age of the ages. In this issue, a human knows his own state, is fair to himself, and dispenses with the fatwa of others. End of Sheikh Abd al-Aziz's words, may Allah have mercy on him.\nSidi Fath al-Mawsili said: I accompanied thirty Sheikhs; all of them used to advise me upon my leaving him to abandon associating with youths and to eat little.",

    "text": "Our Sheikh Shihab al-Din Abu al-Abbas Ahmad al-Zahid, may Allah have mercy on him, said in speaking on Major Sins: Among the major sins is sodomy (*Liwat*), and it is among the greatest major sins except Shirk with Allah—we seek refuge in Allah from it. Allah, Glorified and Exalted, did not combine upon a nation of nations types of punishment as He combined upon the sodomites. He—Glorified and Exalted—blinded their eyes, blackened their faces, commanded His servant Gabriel, peace be upon him, so he uprooted their villages from their foundation, then turned them upside down upon them making their high part their low part, then caused the earth to swallow them, then rained upon them stones from the sky. He did not combine these punishments on others due to the severity of the corruption of this great sin, its obscenity, its ugliness, the severity of His anger at its people, and His loathing of them.\nThe Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, agreed on killing its doer, even if their opinions varied on [the method of] killing him. Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, burned him by the order of Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: The highest building in the village is looked for, then he is thrown from it, then followed by stones.\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Allah cursed he who does the deed of the people of Lot\" twice, and its chain is Hasan.\nHe said: \"Whoever you find doing the deed of the people of Lot, kill the doer and the one done to.\" In a wording: \"Stone the upper and the lower.\" Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, narrated it and acted upon it, and its chain is Hasan.\nFrom Jabir ibn Abdullah that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed the biggest and most severe thing I fear for my nation is the deed of the people of Lot.\"\nHe, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"If the sodomites multiply, Allah Mighty and Majestic lifts His Hand from the creation, so He does not care in which valley they perish.\"\nFrom Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: I asked the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, about the metamorphosed ones (*Mamsukhat*). He said: \"Thirteen persons,\" and he counted them. It was said: What was the cause of their metamorphosis? He mentioned the reasons for which they were metamorphosed. Among them, the cause of the elephant's metamorphosis was that he was a tyrant sodomite.\nFrom Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, raising it: \"Kill the doer and the one done to, and the one who comes to an animal, and the one who comes to Mahrams.\"\nFrom Jabir from a man from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, saying: \"Indeed the most severe thing I fear for my nation after me is the deed of the people of Lot. Let my nation await the punishment when men suffice with men and women with women.\" The man is Abdullah ibn Anas, may Allah be pleased with them both.\nFrom Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Allah cursed he who sacrificed to other than Allah. Allah cursed he who changed the land boundaries. He blinded a blind man from the path. Allah cursed he who insulted his parents. And Allah cursed he who did the deed of the people of Lot.\" In a wording: \"And Allah cursed he who did the deed of the people of Lot\" three times.\nFrom Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Allah cursed seven of His creation from above seven heavens. He repeated the curse on one of them three times, and cursed each one of them a curse that suffices him. He said: Cursed is he who did the deed of the people of Lot, cursed is he who did the deed of the people of Lot, did the deed of the people of Lot. Cursed is he who came to anything of animals. Cursed is he who sacrificed to other than Allah. Cursed is he who was undutiful to his parents. Cursed is he who changed the boundaries of the land. Cursed is he who took as master other than his masters. And he came upon a doer and one done to, and said: Kill them both as Allah killed them, so kill them with stones.\"\nAbu al-Darda, may Allah be pleased with him, stoned a sodomite. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: He is stoned even if he is a virgin. Ali ibn Abi Talib said: He is stoned whether Muhsan (married) or not Muhsan. Khalid ibn al-Walid wrote to Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with them both, regarding that. He consulted the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them. The sternest of them in speech was Ali, may Allah be pleased with him. He said: I see that he should be burned with fire. He said: So the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, agreed on that. So Abu Bakr wrote to Khalid to burn him with fire. Then Ibn al-Zubayr burned them, then Khalid al-Qushayri.\nMujahid, may Allah be pleased with him, said: If the one who did the deed of the people of Lot washed with every drop of the earth and every drop of the sky, he would still remain impure.\nFrom Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, raising it: \"If the sodomite washed with every drop Allah sent down from the sky, that would never purify him.\" Narrated by Abu Umar al-Tartusi, may Allah have mercy on him, in the *Book of Prohibition of Sodomy*.\nFrom Malik, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever dies from my nation doing the deed of the people of Lot, Allah transfers him to them until he is gathered with them.\" Ibn al-Qayyim said: This meaning is correct even if this Hadith is not authentic. Allah Almighty said: (Gather those who committed wrong and their *Azwaj* [kinds/spouses] and what they used to worship besides Allah, and guide them to the path of Hellfire). Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Their *Azwaj* means their likes and counterparts. Allah Almighty said: (And when the souls are paired). Al-Nu'man ibn Bashir said from Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him: Two men who do the deed for one [goal] enter Paradise by it or enter Hell by it. In a narration from him: The righteous man is paired with the righteous man in Paradise, and the evil man with the evil man in Hell.\nA trustworthy man named Abdullah informed me from the righteous brother Sidi Ala' al-Din al-Qutbi, may Allah have mercy on him—and he had companionship with our Sheikh Shihab al-Din al-Zahid, may Allah have mercy on him—that a witnessing was unveiled to him, so he saw a man, dead, shrouded, and on his head [something? text cuts or refers to earlier context]. Sheikh Ala' al-Din was then standing around the pond. We ask Allah for safety. It has been reported that if a sodomite dies and does not repent, he is carried and thrown into the Pool of the People of Lot. No bird, beast, or human drinks from it, and no plant grows in it. It is told that they heard every time at night a snake hissing in the pool hour after hour. It was said that whoever dies upon the deed of the people of Lot, the angels carry him and throw him into it. So beware, O my brother. May Allah save us and you from that by His grace and generosity.\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever dies while doing the deed of the people of Lot does not remain in his grave but one hour until Allah sends an angel in the form of a hook/bat (*Khattaf*), so he snatches him from behind him, and throws him into the land of the people of Lot, planting him in the Fire. We seek refuge in Allah from that.\"",

Chapter: Regarding one who seduces a youth or comes unto him. Abdullah bin al-Mubarak permitted a youth, if an immoral act is sought from him and he cannot escape it except by killing, to kill the one seducing him. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is what the Sunnah requires, because if it is permissible for him to fight [to defend] a dirham of his wealth, then killing the one forcing himself upon him is even more appropriate, even if it leads to killing him. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is consistent with the principles of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) and other Imams. Yazid bin Harun (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when asked about sodomites: \"The one who comes unto a youth between his thighs is the sodomite upon whom is the prescribed punishment (Hadd). And the one who comes unto him in his anus is a disbeliever (Kafir).\" Mujahid said: Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Whoever comes unto a boy has committed disbelief.\" And in another narration from him: \"Whoever comes unto men or women in their anuses has committed disbelief.\" And from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him): \"Whoever comes unto men or women in their anuses has committed disbelief.\"",

    "text": "\"Benefit\": Qadi Husayn was asked about *Sama'* (listening to music/singing). He said: Whoever among the jurists or others makes a habit of it every week or repeatedly every month has committed Fisq and his testimony is rejected.\nAl-Ghazali divided it into: Recommended, Permissible, and Forbidden. Whoever permissible passion for his wife or slave-girl dominates him, it is permissible for him. Whoever forbidden desire dominates him, it is forbidden in his right.\nIbn al-Salah gave a fatwa prohibiting *Sama'* in which tambourine (*Duff*) and flute (*Shabbabah*) are combined.\nThe Sheikh said: *Sama'* in the customary forms is an evil (*Munkar*) and misguidance. No prophet among the prophets brought it, nor did it come in a revealed book. It is from the characteristics of the actions of the ignorant and devils. Whoever claims it is an act of closeness has lied and fabricated against Allah. Whoever says: It increases taste (*Dhawq*), he is ignorant or a devil. He said: Whoever attributes *Sama'* to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, is to be disciplined severely, punished with a far-reaching punishment (*Ta'zir*), and enters the group of liars against the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him; so let him take his seat in the Fire. The way of Allah's allies and His party and the followers of His Messenger is not that of the people of amusement, play, and falsehood. Denouncing this is permissible with the tongue, heart, and hand.\nWhoever among the scholars said *Sama'* is permissible, that is where no tambourine, flute, men, women, one forbidden to look at, or obscene speech are combined in it. A minor sin, if persisted upon, becomes a major sin. Arguing with those who played in the Mosque with spears, and the Hadith of Banu al-Najjar is correct regarding the prohibited type. The scholars of his time from the four schools agreed with the Sheikh on that.\nAs for what is disliked of singing, he said: Singing without an instrument and listening to it is disliked due to His saying: (And of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech). Ibn Mas'ud said: By Allah, it is singing. Narrated by Al-Hakim, and he said: Authentic chain. Where we said singing and listening are disliked, that is if it is from his wife or slave-girl, not from a foreign woman.\nAs for the Permissible: Sheikh Kamal al-Din al-Damiri said: *Huda'* (camel driving song) and listening to it is permissible, due to what Al-Nasa'i narrated in *Amal al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Abdullah ibn Rawahah: \"Move the people,\" so he started reciting Rajaz. He used to chant for the men. Al-Bayhaqi and Al-Bazzar narrated that Ibn Malik used to chant for them too. The two Sheikhs (Bukhari and Muslim) narrated from Anjasha, the black slave, that he chanted for the wives of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him: \"O Anjasha, gently with the glass vessels (*Qawarir*).\" He likened them to glass vessels because breakage comes quickly to them, and if broken they are not mended. That is because camels, when they hear the *Huda'*, quicken their pace and intensify, disturbing the rider and tiring him. So he forbade him from that because women become weak from the severity of the movement.\n*Huda'* with Damma on Ha and with Madd as he vocalized it. It is also called *Hadw*. It is beautifying the melodious voice with permissible urging and the like to lighten the speech, and it generates vigor in the soul. There is no aspect of dislike in it, equal for the chanter and the listener. And Allah knows best.\nAl-Ghazali said: Humming with balanced words is customary in places:\nAmong them the pilgrims: They go around the lands with the drum (*Tabl*) and *Shahin* (flute/instrument?) and singing. That is permissible because they are poems composed in description of the Kaaba, the Maqam, the Hatim, Zamzam, and all the ritual sites, and description of the desert and others. Their effect stirs longing for the Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah. If the drum and *Shahin* are added to it, the effect increases. That is permissible as long as flutes and string instruments (*Awtar*), which are emblems of the wicked, do not enter into it.\nAlso among the permissible is what warriors are accustomed to for inciting people to war. That is also permissible like the pilgrims.\nAlso from that are the Rajaz poems which the two Sheikhs heard at the time of meeting. The purpose of it is encouraging the self and the supporters, stirring the self in it for fighting, and boasting of courage and bravery. Beating the *Shahin* in the warriors' camp should be prevented, for its voice is softening, dissolving the knot of courage, weakening the resolve of the soul, stirring longing for family and homeland, and bequeathing lethargy in fighting. Likewise all voices that soften the heart.\nFrom that is what is said during wedding days. From that is the listening of lovers to stir longing for Allah Almighty, for one who loves Allah and loves meeting Him; as long as in all mentioned there is no mention of cheeks, statures, breasts, waists, buttocks, curves, Su'da, Lubna, and Layla. It is not permissible to apply that to Allah, Glorified and Exalted. Nor is it permissible to refer by it to the love of creatures, describing them with that due to forbidden love caused by overwhelming desires. We seek refuge in Allah.\nAs for what is applied of that to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, his description, his form, and his good traits and morals, that is sought and encouraged so his nation yearns for him and cries out with blessings upon him. Some scholars said: As for what was of mentioning cheeks and statures, it is not permissible to apply it. And Allah knows best.\n\nChapter",

    "text": "Mentioning the Doubts Clung to by Those Who Permitted Listening to Singing\n\nSome of them argued for the permissibility of singing with the Hadith of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, entered upon me while I had two girls from the girls of the Ansar singing what the Ansar said to each other on the Day of Bu'ath. He said: With the flute of Satan in the house of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him? The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Leave them, O Abu Bakr, for every people has a festival (Eid) and this is our Eid.\"\nThe answer is that the two girls were below the age of puberty (*Mukallafat* - context implies *not* Mukallafat or barely, as 'Jarita' implies young), singing the singing of the Bedouins which was said on the Day of Bu'ath regarding courage and war. When Abu Bakr said that, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, apologized to him saying: They are days of Eid, and he did not denounce Abu Bakr's saying.\nSome of the Knowers (*Arifin*) said: Most of what establishes singing is the passionate love of images. The person of singing is between two matters: either he openly violates decency and becomes a libertine (*Fajir*), or he feigns piety and becomes a hypocrite; for he shows desire for Allah and the Hereafter while his heart boils with desires and love of what Allah and His Messenger hate of the sounds of musical instruments and tools of amusement.\nAl-Dahhak, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Singing is a corruption for the heart, a cause of wrath for the Lord.\"\nIbn Mas'ud, Al-Hasan, Al-Nakha'i, and Mujahid said regarding His Almighty's saying: (And of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech to mislead from the way of Allah without knowledge), the verse: It is singing. Ibn Mas'ud added: And listening to it.\nMujahid said regarding His Almighty's saying: (And incite [to sin] whoever you can among them with your voice): With singing and flutes.\nAbu Ishaq ibn Sha'ban narrated in his book *Al-Zahi* with his chain that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"It is not lawful to sell singing girls nor to buy them nor to trade in them.\" And he added: \"Nor teach them.\" Regarding them was revealed (And of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech).\nAnother added: \"By the One who sent me with the truth, no man raises his voice (*'Aqirah*) singing but that Allah Almighty sends at that two devils pounding on his shoulders, they do not cease striking his chest until he is the one who falls silent.\"\n\nChapter\nOn Musical Instruments (*Ma'azif*) and Explaining Their Form\n\nAl-Nawawi said: It is forbidden to use an instrument that is an emblem of drinkers because it is a tool of drinking and invites to it, and in it is imitation of its people, which is forbidden. Likewise, if a group imitates the appearance of wine drinkers, arranges a gathering, brings the tool of drinking and its cups, pours Oxymel (*Sikanjabin*) in it, appoints a cupbearer to circulate among them, and they answer each other with their customary words among themselves, that is forbidden. He said: Like the Tanbur, Oud, Sanj (Cymbals), and Iraqi flute, and listening to them. His saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"There will be among my nation people who make lawful silk (*Khazz* and *Harir*) and musical instruments (*Ma'azif*).\" Narrated by Al-Bukhari from his sheikh Hisham ibn Ammar.\nAs he said in *Al-Ihya*: They invite to drinking wine, and imitating the people of disobedience is forbidden. Among *Ma'azif* are: Rebab, Jank (Harp), and Kamanja (Violin). Playing them is forbidden, which is the usage meant by the author. The first to play the Oud was Lamech son of Methuselah. They said: It is composed of psychological movements that remove grief, strengthen ambition, and increase vigor. This has no validity; because it is the most enchanting of amusements and the most distracting from the remembrance of Allah Almighty and from prayer. I indicated that in the poem (*Manzumah*) by my saying:\n*And the tones of the Oud for the sad one ... They said: Remove the trace of sorrows.*\n*So decide on prohibition, any decision ... And prudence is not to follow Ibn Hazm.*\n*For strings have been permitted by him ... And the Oud and the Tanbur and the Flute.*\nThe Tanbur is known. The Sanj, Al-Jawhari said: It is brass struck one against another, specific to the Arabs. The stringed one is for the Persians.",

    "text": "Sheikh Sharaf al-Din al-Barizi said Al-Rafi'i meant by it the stringed one. This is stranger than him, for Al-Rafi'i said after that: Striking with the castanets (*Safaqatayn*) is forbidden, mentioned by Sheikh Abu Muhammad and others, and the Imam paused [on it]. This is the Arab Sanj. The Sanj was expressed in the Madhhab as *Sillil* with Kasra on the Sad and Tashdid on the Lam with Kasra.\nAs for the Iraqi flute: It is the one played with strings, and it is with Kasra on the Mim. This is what Al-Baghawi and Ibn Abi Asrun corrected. He said in *Al-Rawdah*: It is the more correct view, and it is this flute called: *Shabbabah*.\nIbn al-Salah said: The disagreement is regarding the Duff (tambourine) which has jingles (*Jalajil*). It is permissible in weddings and walimas due to the Hadith: \"Announce the marriage, make it in the mosques, and beat the Duff for it.\" The preferred view is that the contract be in the mosque, and beating the Duff be elsewhere. It is permissible in circumcision due to what Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated from Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that when he heard the sound of the Duff, he investigated. If it was in a marriage or circumcision he remained silent, and if it was in other than them he acted with the whip (*Durra*). Jingles may mean the rings and other things made in the *Mazahir* (lutes?) which are customarily played.\nAmong *Ma'azif* is the \"Kubah\". Beating the \"Kubah\" is forbidden. It is a drum with a narrow middle and wide ends, due to what Abu Umamah narrated and Ibn Hibban corrected from Abbas that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed Allah forbade wine, gambling, and the Kubah,\" with Damma on the Kaf and Sukun on the Waw.\nAmong the instruments: *Al-Sayasi*, which are four pieces of wood, the length of a span or less, placed in their hands, two in each hand, clacking them against each other.\n*Al-Nafir*: A horn of brass in which a sound is heard.\n*Al-Qadib*: These are sticks made of ebony wood, each two and a half cubits long, struck one against the other so a sound is heard from them.\nAmong the instruments is *Al-Qabz*: It is in the shape of the Oud and *Shashta* except its belly is very small and its neck is long.\nAmong the instruments is *Al-Shantir*: Made of wood also, square except one of its sides is longer than the rest, its strings are of brass. These instruments are forbidden to use and listen to.\nAs for the *Qaynah* (singing girl): The intended meaning is the slave-girl who sings for men in the gathering of drinking and others, and the one who does not sing but is taken for immorality, whether she is a virgin or previously married, free or slave. We ask Allah for safety.\n\nTaking types of intoxicants voids the integrity of the just:\n\"Notice\" Know that types of disobedience and instruments of amusement—playing with them, listening to them, and using them from what was mentioned and what will be mentioned later of types of gambling, and taking types of intoxicants—void the integrity (*Adalah*) of the just witnesses, and false testimony is rejected because of it. This is its state in the world along with what it bequeaths of poverty, need, and falling from the eyes of creation. So how about what falls from the eye of Allah? That is a punishment in the world. This is if he is safe from ruin or the oppression of an oppressor. So what will be his state in the Hereafter if he does not repent? We ask Allah for safety and success to the path of peace.\n\nChapter\nOn Clarifying the Hadiths Reported in Threatening Against That\n\nIt was narrated from Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"If my nation does fifteen traits, punishment will befall it.\" It was said: What are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: \"When the spoil is [distributed only among] the rich, the trust is [considered] a spoil, Zakat is [considered] a fine, the man obeys his wife and disobeys his mother, is kind to his friend and harsh to his father, voices are raised in the mosques, the leader of the people is the vilest of them, and he is honored for fear of his evil, wines are drunk, silk is worn, singing girls and musical instruments are adopted, and the last of this nation curses the first of it—then let them await at that time a red wind, or swallowing by the earth, or metamorphosis.\" May Allah protect us from that.",

    "text": "\"Notice\" Know that 'Ma'azif' refers to all instruments of entertainment; there is no disagreement on this. If they were lawful, He would not have condemned them for deeming them lawful, and He would not have coupled their deeming lawful with the deeming lawful of alcohol and \"Al-Hir\". If it is with the letter Ha and Ra, it means deeming lawful the forbidden private parts (fornication/adultery). If it is with the dotted Kha and Zay (Khazz), it is a type of silk other than what was authentically reported that the Companions wore, as \"Khazz\" is of two types: one made of silk and the other of wool. This Hadith has been narrated in both ways. Ibn Majah narrated from Malik al-Ash'ari who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"People from my nation will drink wine, naming it by other than its name. Instruments of music (Ma'azif) will be played over their heads. Allah will cause the earth to swallow them up, and He will make some of them into monkeys and pigs.\" Its chain of narration is authentic. Allah Almighty has threatened those who deem musical instruments lawful with being swallowed by the earth and transformed into monkeys and pigs. Although the threat is for these actions collectively, each one of them has a share in the condemnation and threat. From Sahl bin Sa'd al-Sa'idi, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"There will be in my nation swallowing (by the earth), bombardment (with stones), and transformation.\" It was said: O Messenger of Allah, when will that be? He said: \"When musical instruments and female singers appear, and alcohol is deemed lawful.\" As for the Hadith of Imran narrated by Al-Tirmidhi: \"There will be in my nation swallowing, bombardment, and transformation.\" A man from the Muslims said: When is that, O Messenger of Allah? He said: \"When female singers and musical instruments appear and wines are drunk.\" Ahmad narrated in his Musnad and Abu Dawood from him that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Verily, Allah has forbidden wine, gambling, Al-Mizr (a type of nabidh), Al-Kubah (drum), and Al-Ghubayra' (an intoxicant).\" As for the Hadith of Ibn Abbas, it is also in the Musnad that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Verily, Allah has forbidden wine, gambling, Al-Kubah, every intoxicant, and the drum.\" From Abu Umamah Al-Bahili, narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad from him, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, who said: \"A group of my nation will spend the night eating, drinking, and playing. Then they will wake up as monkeys and pigs. A wind will be sent against tribes of them, blowing them away as it blew away those before them, because of their deeming lawful of alcohol, playing the tambourines (Dufuf), and taking female singers.\" And from Abu Umamah from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, who said: \"A people from this nation will spend the night in arrogance, insolence, and play, so they will wake up transformed into monkeys and pigs. And they will surely be afflicted by swallowing (by the earth) and bombardment (from the sky) until people wake up saying: 'The house of so-and-so was swallowed last night! Allah caused the house of so-and-so to be swallowed!' And stones will surely be sent upon them from the sky as were sent upon the people of Lot, upon tribes therein and upon houses therein. And the barren wind which destroyed 'Ad will surely be sent upon them, due to their drinking of alcohol, devouring of usury, taking of female singers, and severing of ties of kinship.\" As for the Hadith of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"If Allah is angry with a nation, then He does not send down the punishment upon them until their prices rise, their lifespans shorten, their trade does not profit, their rains are withheld from them, their rivers do not flow abundantly, and their evil ones are given power over them.\" As for the Hadith of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"There will be in my nation swallowing (by the earth) and bombardment (from the sky).\" I said: O Messenger of Allah, even while they say 'La ilaha illa Allah' (There is no god but Allah)? He said: \"When female singers appear, and adultery appears, and alcohol is drunk, and silk is worn, this will happen among us.\" As for the Hadith of Abdullah bin Sabit, Ibn Abi al-Dunya narrated it from him, saying: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"There will be in my nation musical instruments, and they deemed alcohol lawful.\" Chapter: On the Stance of Al-Qurtubi Regarding Those Who Permit Listening to Frame Drums (Tarat) and Flutes (Shababat).",

    "text": "Al-Qurtubi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: I heard some of those who deviated from the truth and turned away from the straight path, with a group of the poor (Sufis) gathered around him, saying: Listening to frame drums and flutes with beautiful faces and the existing hearing (Sama') is permissible, and it is my school of thought and I profess it! A discussion and desertion occurred between me and him. I said to him: This is a rejected saying and a forbidden act by the consensus of Muslims according to what our Imams have transmitted, as it is debauchery (Fusuq), and because human nature incites looking, and blows into the heart what is not lawful. Whoever says that his nature is different from human nature has lied. He answered defending himself by saying: I only meant by beautiful faces those by which one draws closer to Allah Almighty. I said to him: This is an unsound interpretation and equivocation not on the upright method. Your general statement should have been restricted so that nothing else is understood from it. One only draws closer to Allah Almighty with humble hearts and submissive souls that submitted to His might, feared His greatness, and knew Him with true knowledge. Allah Almighty said: (Those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned) and He Almighty said: (You see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they recognized of the truth). He did not say their beautiful faces. The overflowing of the eye and the shivering of the skin only emanate from what has settled in the heart of incoming spiritual states. These states do not require listening to strings, nor flute and frame drum. Then, how is it permissible to express the Truth (Allah) in it using Layla and Su'da with a feminine wording, applying it to Allah, as it contains resemblance to the disbelievers and misguidance in their applying the feminine gender to their gods? They said: Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat, the third, the other. We seek refuge in Allah from sins and disobedience, and we bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and we bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and we ask Him for well-being and protection; indeed, He has power over all things. The First Type of Gambling: Chess. Our Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Playing chess is disliked (Makruh), and it is said: Forbidden (Haram). Based on the first (disliked), it is permissible only with conditions: First: That it does not contain images, otherwise it is strictly forbidden. Second: That there is no money involved, otherwise it is gambling. Third: That no duty upon him is lost; if he becomes occupied with it from earning for his dependents, it is forbidden in these cases. Fourth: That his tongue is safe from backbiting and slander, and his hearing from listening to that. Fifth: That he does not persist in playing it, for persistence in it drops one's testimony. Sixth: That he does not play it on the road, as mentioned by some. Seventh: It is like playing with 'Manqalah'. Al-Damiri said: Ibn Al-Athir disliked playing with Manqalah and the chess of the Maghrebis as explained in Al-Matlab, Al-Jawahir, and Al-Muhimmat. Nafi' narrated from Sufyan Al-Thawri from Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Cursed is he who plays chess, and the one looking at it is like the eater of pig meat.\" The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, passed by a people playing chess and said: \"What is this distress? Did I not forbid this?! The curse of Allah be upon whoever plays with it.\" From Abdullah bin Umar, he said: Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, was asked about chess and he said: \"It is worse than Nard (Backgammon).\" The Second Type of Gambling: Playing with Manqalah. It is like playing chess because it requires thought and looking. Chess (Shatranj) is with Fatha on the Shin and Kasra, and Fatha is more famous. He said: The owner of chess is the most lying of people; he says: \"I killed\" while he did not kill. From Wathilah bin Al-Asqa' that he said: \"Verily, Allah looks at creation every day one hundred and sixty looks; the owner of chess has no share in them.\" From Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"If you pass by those who play with Azlam - chess and backgammon - do not greet them.\" Al-Bayhaqi narrated from Al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: Playing is not a trait of the people of religion and chivalry.\" The Third Type: Playing with Tab (a game with sticks). It is close to playing with backgammon and it is forbidden. \"Branch\": Sheikh Kamal al-Din al-Damiri said: The Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, gave a fatwa prohibiting Tab because the reliance in it is on what the four sticks produce. Our Sheikh was asked about it and he answered with dislike (Karahah), but prohibition is more apparent in it. The Fourth Type: Playing with the Kamanjah (Violin/Rebab). If there is \"money\" in it, it is gambling. Sheikh Kamal al-Din al-Damiri said: As for the Kamanjah, if there is an offer (money/goods) in it, it is forbidden, for there is no doubt it is gambling. Playing with pigeons is implied by Al-Rafi'i's words in the chapter on competition. The Fifth Type: Playing with Pigeons.",

    "text": "It is among the vices that drop testimony and it is from the actions of the people of Lot. Abu Dawood narrated from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, saw a man following a pigeon playing with it, so he said: \"A devil following his female devil.\" Al-Bayhaqi, may Allah have mercy on him, said this. Some scholars interpreted it as the persistence of the pigeon owner in flying it, being occupied with it, and climbing rooftops from which he overlooks the neighbors' houses and their women (Haram) because of it. Then he attributed it to Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: \"The plaything of the family of Pharaoh was pigeons.\" From Ibrahim al-Nakha'i, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: \"Whoever plays with flying pigeons will not die until he tastes poverty.\" From Sufyan al-Thawri, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: I heard that playing with pigeons is from the work of the family of Lot. Sheikh Jamal al-Din said: Keeping them for chicks or carrying \"messages\" (homing pigeons) is permissible. Playing with swings is disliked. The Sixth Type: Playing with Images (figurines/idols) and gathering people around them. A scholar from the scholars of Sunnah said: In the authentic Hadith \"Every amusement is false except a man shooting with his bow, training his horse, and playing with his wife.\" Al-Halimi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Everything men amuse themselves with that has no benefit in the immediate nor in the future is false, and turning away from it is better, except these three matters, for they are of the Truth. The Seventh Type: Playing with Nard (Backgammon) and Chess. Reports and verses have been narrated regarding them. The summary of the saying regarding them is that playing with them on the condition of money (gambling) is forbidden by consensus. Playing with them without the condition of money is disputed. He said: Its prohibition is more likely to me. The school of Abu Hanifa and Malik, may Allah have mercy on them, is that it is disliked with a dislike of prohibition (Makruh Tahriman). Imam Ahmad was asked about chess: Is it from the Truth? It was said: What is after the Truth except error...!! From Buraydah, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Whoever plays with Nardashir (Backgammon), it is as if he dipped his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig.\" Narrated by Muslim. Al-Halimi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: The meaning of this according to scholars is that he is like one who dipped his hand in pig's flesh and blood in its form because he eats it. In summary, playing Nard is like eating pig meat. From Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever plays with Nard or Nardashir has disobeyed Allah and His Messenger.\" From the Mother of the Believers Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, that she sent to a people living in a house belonging to her who had Nard, saying to them: \"If you do not take it out, I will expel you from my house,\" and she denounced that upon them. In Al-Muwatta', from Nafi' from Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, that if he found anyone from his family playing with Nard, he would beat him and break it. From Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him: He used to say: \"Nard is Maysir (gambling).\" Mentioned by Al-Bayhaqi. Al-Mawardi said: Nard is based on the twelve zodiac signs and the seven planets because its houses are twelve, and the dots on the sides of the width are seven. It is Persian Arabized. The meaning of 'Shir' is sweet. The first to invent it was Ardashir bin Babak. From Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-Aas that he said: \"Whoever plays with dice (Ka'bain) for gambling, it is as if he ate pig meat, and whoever plays with them without gambling is like one who greases himself with pig fat.\" Types of gambling are many. Gambling is taking money in exchange for something by way of overcoming, either by a person's knowledge, or by the strength of an animal he owns, or by Tab, or chess, or Nard, or throwing coins in a hole, or ram butting, or cock fighting, or other than that. This has become prevalent. Everything on which a bet is placed is forbidden and false except what the Sharia has excepted from this prohibited principle, which are three things for the interest of Jihad as the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"There is no contest (Sabq) except in Khuff (camel racing), or Hafir (horse racing), or Nasl (archery).\" 'Sabq' is the name of the money stipulated on camel racing which is Khuff, horse racing which is Hafir, and shooting arrows which is Nasl. It is not lawful to take money by overcoming except in these three under the conditions explained by jurists in Fiqh books so that it exits from prohibited gambling for fear of falling into it. There must be an analyst (Muhallil) who gains and does not lose (pays). From Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: To roll two embers in my hand until they extinguish is dearer to me than playing with dice. From Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, that he passed by a people playing chess and said: \"What are these statues to which you are devoted? For one of you to touch an ember until it extinguishes is better for him than to touch them.\" He used to say chess is the gambling of the non-Arabs. Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, was asked about chess and he said: It is worse than Nard. Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari said: None plays chess except a sinner.

    "text": "It is recommended to raise and acquire a cat due to his saying, peace be upon him: \"They are among those who roam around you (tawwafin) and roam around (tawwafat).\" Al-Hafiz said: It is recommended to raise and keep it due to this report, because it kills mice and snakes, and killing them is recommended. These are things forbidden for a person to acquire: Among them is the dog for one who does not need it, likewise the kite, the scorpion, the mouse, the speckled crow, wine that is not respected (not for vinegar etc.), the idol and statues, and vessels made of gold and silver or mostly gold or silver. He also said: It is forbidden to acquire the mouse, the Kubah (drum), the drum of amusement, Nard (backgammon), and the shepherds' flute, which is the Shahin of shepherds made of reed, contrary to Al-Ghazali, and it is forbidden to acquire the Shababah (flute). A scholar said: How strange is he who knows that before him are two abodes and he must inhabit one of them, and that inhabiting the Abode of Good and escaping the Abode of Evil is only reached by righteous deeds, and that increase in degrees there is by increase in good deeds here. Yet, with that, he knows that the duration of his stay in this world is limited, and the breaths of his life are counted upon him, while he distracts himself with play right and left, and his heart increases thereby in hardness and ruin. A wall with a door has been struck between this heart and goodness, and the densest veil has been lowered upon it. Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we shall return. So busy yourselves, O assembly of seekers (Muridin), with Allah Almighty and His obedience in what He commanded and forbade you. Whoever's preoccupation is Allah dies upon 'La ilaha illa Allah', and whoever's preoccupation is other than Him, his passion increases for what he loved; a person dies upon what he lived upon. It was said to a man: Say \"La ilaha illa Allah\". He said: Ah, Ah, I cannot say it. It was said to another: Say \"La ilaha illa Allah\". He said: Shah Rukh (Checkmate), I beat you, then he died. It was said to another: Say \"La ilaha illa Allah\". He started raving with songs until he died. It was said to another: Say \"La ilaha illa Allah\". He said: What you say does not benefit me. I did not leave a sin but I committed it, then he died and did not say it. It was said to another: Say \"La ilaha illa Allah\". He said: It does not avail me, and I do not know that I ever prayed a prayer for Allah!! And he did not say it. I was informed by one who attended some beggars at their death: He started saying: A fils (penny) for Allah... A fils for Allah... until he died. I was informed by some merchants that one was dying, so they started instructing him: \"La ilaha illa Allah\", while he was saying: This piece is cheap, this is a good buy, this is such and such, until he died. Glory be to Allah, how many lessons people have witnessed from this! And what is hidden from them of the conditions of the dying is greater and greater. If this is while his mind, strength, and perfection of perception are present, Satan has gained control over him and used him in what he wants of disobedience to Allah, and his heart has been heedless of the remembrance of Allah Almighty, and his tongue has been disabled from His remembrance and his limbs from His obedience. So what is the thought about him when his strength falls, and his heart and soul are occupied with the pain of agony within him, and Satan gathers his strength against him and rallies against him with all he can to seize an opportunity from him, for that is the end of the deed. So his devil is strongest against him at that time, and he is weakest in that state. So who do you see will be safe from that? There, Allah keeps firm those who believe, with the firm word, in worldly life and in the Hereafter. And Allah sends astray the wrongdoers. And Allah does what He wills. O Allah, keep us firm with the firm word in worldly life and in the Hereafter. Mujahid, may Allah have mercy on him, said: No one dies but the people of his gatherings whom he used to sit with are presented to him at death. If they were people of amusement, then people of amusement; and if they were people of remembrance (Dhikr), then people of remembrance. May Allah make us and you among those who remember.

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to some of his companions: \"Do not accompany except a believer, and let no one eat your food except a pious person.\" Listen to the Almighty's saying: (O Noah, indeed he is not of your family). So Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, forbade His Prophet from saying about his son: \"He is of my family\"; because of his opposition to Allah and His Messenger. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Salman Al-Farisi: \"Salman is from us, the People of the House (Ahl al-Bayt)\" due to his obedience to Allah and His Messenger. It was said to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: Who is most beloved to you? He said: \"Every pious person.\" Allah Almighty said: (You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. Those - He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit from Him. And We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him - those are the party of Allah. Unquestionably, the party of Allah - they are the successful). Know, may Allah have mercy on you and all Muslims, that a Muslim must love whom Allah loves, draw near to whom Allah Almighty draws near, hate whom Allah Almighty hates, and distance himself from whom Allah Almighty distances. Then he deserves Allah's mercy. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever loves for Allah, hates for Allah, gives for Allah, and withholds for Allah has completed faith.\" So whoever is of the people of obedience and draws near the people of disobedience, Allah distances him. Whoever pleases them has angered Allah. Whoever honors them, Allah humiliates him. Whoever loves them, Allah hates him and gathers him with them, due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"A person is with whom he loves.\" Jesus, peace be upon him, said: \"O assembly of disciples, endear yourselves to Allah by hating the people of disobedience and immorality, and seek the pleasure of Allah Almighty by distancing yourselves from them through His wrath. They said: Who should we sit with? He said: He whose sight reminds you of Allah, whose speech increases you in knowledge of the Hereafter, and whose logic increases your understanding.\" He said: If the ascetic's neighbors are pleased with him, know that he is a compromiser (Mudahin). He said: Do not sit with youths (Ahdath - beardless boys), for their temptation is more severe than virgins. He said: Do not sit with drinkers of alcohol, do not visit their sick, and do not attend their funerals, for the drinker of alcohol will come on the Day of Resurrection with a blackened face, blue eyes, his tongue lolling on his chest, drooling, disgusting everyone who sees him. A person should not associate except with people of his path if it is in accordance with the Book and the Sunnah, and should not associate with other than his own kind from the innovators. Allah Almighty said: (And do not believe except in those who follow your religion), meaning do not associate except with those who follow your agreement on your states and path. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said reporting from his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic: \"Indeed this is a religion I have chosen for Myself, and nothing will rectify it except generosity and good character, so honor it with them as long as you accompany it.\" Beware of befriending the people of innovation with affection, for it takes away the lights of the hearts, and beautifying their actions bequeaths the hatred of the Truth and distance from Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. Abu Hatim, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The wise person does not sully his honor nor accustom himself to causes of evil by sticking to the company of the wicked, nor does he overlook preserving his honor and training himself by the company of the good. For indeed, people upon testing reveal things contrary to the apparent. From Abu Amr bin Al-Ala, he said: Sa'id bin Jubayr saw me sitting with youths and said: What makes you sit with youths? You must stick to the elders (Sheikhs). Abu Darda' said: A righteous companion is better than solitude, and solitude is better than an evil companion. Dictating good is better than being silent, and silence is better than dictating evil. Abu Hatim said: The wise person does not accompany the wicked; because the company of an evil companion is a piece of fire that breeds grudges. His affection is not upright, nor does he fulfill his covenant. Every companion from whom a person does not benefit good, sitting with a dog is better than his company. Whoever accompanies evil is not safe, just as he who enters an evil entrance is accused. Whoever's friends are wicked, he is the most wicked of them. Just as the good person only accompanies the righteous, likewise the bad person only accompanies the immoral. Some wise men said: Whoever sits with eight types increases in eight things: Whoever sits with the rich increases in lack of gratitude and dissatisfaction with Allah's division, or its reverse.",

    "text": "Whoever sits with the Sultan increases in arrogance and hardness of heart. Whoever sits with women, Allah increases him in ignorance and lust. Whoever sits with children, Allah increases him in play and joking. Whoever sits with the immoral (Fussaq), Allah increases him in boldness in sins and procrastination of repentance. Whoever sits with the righteous, Allah increases him in desire for acts of obedience. Whoever sits with scholars, Allah increases him in knowledge and piety (Wara'). Yahya bin Mu'adh said: \"Avoid three types of people: Heedless scholars, compromising poor people (Fuqara' - possibly Sufis), and ignorant Sufis.\" He said: \"Company of the people of righteousness bequeaths success in the heart, and company of the people of corruption bequeaths corruption in it.\" May Allah make us, you, and the Muslims among those granted success to sit with the righteous. Chapter: Warning against the Company of People of Innovation, Sitting with Them, and Greeting Them. Most corruption occurs from mixing with innovators. Our Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Know that one of the severest trials is looking into the beliefs of the people of innovation who oppose the belief of this Saved Sect. So beware of them and beware of looking into their beliefs. It has been reported in the tradition from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"Allah does not accept from an innovator fasting, prayer, charity, Hajj, Umrah, Jihad, obligatory charity (Sarf), nor voluntary charity ('Adl). He exits Islam as a hair is pulled out of dough.\" Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever honors an innovator has aided in the destruction of Islam.\" Al-Fudayl bin Iyad, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Whoever loves an innovator, Allah frustrates his deeds and removes the light of Islam from his heart. He said: \"A believer looking at a believer is a polish for the heart, and a believer looking at an innovator bequeaths blindness.\" He said: If you see an innovator on a path, take another path. He said: No deed is raised for an innovator, and whoever aids an innovator has aided in the destruction of Islam. Sufyan said: \"Whoever listens to an innovator, Allah will not benefit him with what he heard, and whoever shakes his hand has undone the knots of Islam one by one.\" Sufyan said: Whoever lends his ear to an innovator has left the protection of Allah Almighty. He said: Do not pray behind one who says faith is without deeds, nor behind one who insults Abu Bakr and Umar. He said: If news reaches you of a man from the People of Sunnah (in the east/west), send him Salam (for they are few). Abd al-Samad bin Zaid said: I heard a man say to Al-Fudayl: Whoever marries his beloved daughter to an innovator has cut her ties of kinship. Whoever sits with an innovator will not be given wisdom. If Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, knows from a man that he hates an innovator, I hope He will forgive him. He said: So beware of the people of innovation and desires, and you must follow the people of the Straight Path. Allah Almighty said: (And this is My path, straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way). He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Allah's hand is over the Jama'ah (Community); whoever deviates from them, devils snatch him.\" Al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Whoever wants Allah to open his heart with the light of knowledge, let him adhere to solitude, little eating, and leaving the company of fools. Al-Hafiz Al-Dimyati said: And beware of mixing with the unjust and aiding them, and honoring the people of innovation and loving them. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever humiliates an innovator, Allah will secure him on the Day of the Great Terror.\" Beware of smiling in the face of an oppressor, or making room for him in a gathering, or giving him from your gift. Maymun bin Mahran, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Company of the Sultan is a danger; if you obey him you risk your religion, and if you disobey him you risk your life. Safety is that you do not know him and he does not know you. Al-Qurtubi said: Sufyan Al-Thawri said: \"Whoever takes a shield, money, or weapon from an oppressor and fights with it in the path of Allah is cursed with every step he lifts and places until he returns.\" Beware of loving a wicked person, an oppressor, a sinner, or an innovator, or inclining towards any of them, or smiling in his face. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Do not give a wicked person a favor upon me so that You provide him love from me.\" Beware of leaning towards the oppressors. Allah Almighty said: (And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest you be touched by the Fire). Beware of loving those who do not deserve love among the erroneous, or accepting kindness from them, for hearts are naturally disposed to love those who are kind to them.

    "text": "Most corruption occurs from the company of oppressors, being near them, and leaning towards them. Most of those who aid in sins and corruption are people from the oppressors among the police and others. People of sin take favors with them to protect them and defend them against those who oppose them. That is because the oppressors have established a regular bribe (Suht) for themselves upon the people of sin and corruption, such as immoral women, and those who have wine or intoxicants of various types kept for sale. When they take this regular bribe from them, they protect them from those who disturb them, confirm them in their sins, and permit them that. Allah Almighty said: (Listeners to falsehood, devourers of Suht [illicit gain]). It was revealed regarding the Jews; they used to listen to those who lied among them, and take bribes from those they judged for, and bribes from those they interceded for. So this noble verse was revealed, and Allah Almighty condemned them for their action. Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we shall return. Then know that Allah described the oppressors (Zalimin) with sixteen descriptions: First: He described them as those whom Allah does not love, He said: (And Allah does not love the wrongdoers). Second: He described them as those whom Allah does not help, He said: (And the warner has come to you. So taste [the punishment], for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper). Its parallel is: (And the wrongdoers have no protector or helper). Third: He forbade being near them, He said: (And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest you be touched by the Fire). Its parallel: (Then do not sit after the reminder with the wrongdoing people). Fourth: He mentioned that He does not guide them, He said: (Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people). Fifth: He mentioned them as those who do not succeed, He said: (Or deny His signs. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed). Its parallel: (Who will have the [good] consequence of the home. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed). Sixth: He mentioned that He threatened and warned them, He said: (And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned). Its parallel: (And the wrongdoers among these will be struck by the evil consequences of what they earned). Seventh: He mentioned the ruin of their houses, He said: (So those are their houses, desolate because of the wrong they had done). Its parallel: (And how many a city We destroyed while it was committing wrong). Eighth: He mentioned that woe is for them, He said: (So woe to those who have wronged from the punishment of a painful Day). Its parallel: (They said, \"O woe to us! Indeed, we were wrongdoers\"). Ninth: He mentioned that He has prepared the Fire for them, He said: (Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire). Its parallel: (The outcome for both of them is that they will be in the Fire, abiding eternally therein). Tenth: He mentioned that He resurrects them at death [sic - likely refers to taking souls], He said: (And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death). Its parallel: (Those whom the angels take [in death] while they are wronging themselves). Eleventh: He mentioned that He prepared a painful punishment, He said: (Indeed, the wrongdoers will have a painful punishment). Its parallel: (Those who oppress the people and rebel in the earth without right). Twelfth: He informed of their regret on the Day of Resurrection, He said: (And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, \"Is there any way for return?\"). Its parallel: (O woe to us! We were indeed in heedlessness of this; rather, we were wrongdoers). Thirteenth: Allah cursed them: (Those will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are the ones who lied against their Lord.\" Unquestionably, the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers). Its parallel: (Then an announcer between them will announce, \"The curse of Allah be on the wrongdoers\"). Fourteenth: He mentioned their destruction, He said: (That is because your Lord would not destroy the cities for wrong[doing] while their people were unaware). Its parallel His saying: (Indeed, We will destroy the people of this city. Indeed, its people have been wrongdoers). Fifteenth: He mentioned their regret over the wrongdoer, so He, Glory be to Him, said: (And if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it). Its parallel: (And you will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned). Sixteenth: He mentioned their evil consequences, so He Almighty said: (Those before them denied, so observe how was the end of the wrongdoers). Its parallel: (And they rejected them, while their inner selves were convinced thereof, out of injustice and haughtiness). Al-Siqilli said: The earth shivered and the sky held back [rain] due to the injustice of the wicked. Blessings went away, and good things decreased due to the immorality of the oppressors. The light of day and the darkness of night wept from the malicious deeds and actions. The Noble Scribes (angels) and the Successors Preservers complained to the Lord of the Worlds. So hasten - may Allah have mercy on you - to repentance and desisting, perhaps great matters - in hardships - whose scents have appeared may be repelled thereby. So we ask Allah for salvation from them and safety from their banes. He said: There will be tribulations where a person of religion will not settle in a desert because of the injustice of their sultan, nor reside in a city because of the malice of their scholars, nor remain in a frontier because of the immorality of their reciters. So there is no rest then in the desert except by spending money and preserving religion, and no rest in the frontier except in withdrawal, loneliness, fleeing, isolation, contentment with humility and scarcity, and bidding farewell to all people in religion and worldly life.

    "text": "You must avoid oppressors and distance yourself from them. My master Abu Al-Hasan Al-Shadhili, may Allah have mercy on him, said: One should avoid oppressors. A knower from his companions said: And he spoke the truth - may Allah be pleased with him. He said: By avoiding oppressors, safety in religion occurs, because the company of oppressors unveils the light of faith, and by avoiding them is also salvation from the punishment of Allah Almighty. (And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest you be touched by the Fire). Some scholars said: A person should not live in the places of oppressors for fear that a calamity befalls them and he is struck, or his nature steals from their nature. Prohibition of Blameworthy Places: Some scholars said: The prohibition of blameworthy places has been reported. He said: Abu Dawood narrated from Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, that prayer time came upon him in the \"Land of Babylon\", so he delayed the prayer until the people left [the place] and said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: \"It is a cursed land.\" Likewise the \"Land of Thamud\" for wrath has descended upon it, and likewise \"Dwellings of the people of Lot\" and \"Wadi Muhassir\" and similar places. From the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: In what he narrates from his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, that He said: (O My servants, indeed I have forbidden injustice upon Myself and made it forbidden among you, so do not oppress one another). From Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Beware of injustice, for injustice is darknesses on the Day of Resurrection. And beware of stinginess (Shuhh), for stinginess destroyed those who were before you; it led them to shed their blood and deem their prohibitions lawful.\" Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Woe to the oppressors from the wisest of Judges and the Knower of the conscience of concealers.\" Chapter: On Dealing with the People of the Covenant (Ahl al-Dhimmah). Most corruption occurs from the People of the Covenant, mixing with them, and employing them. Know that a booklet from the words of the Sheikh, the Imam, the Scholar, the Allama Jamal al-Din Abd al-Rahim al-Isnawi al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, relating to dealing with the People of the Covenant in what suits them, became available to this poor one (the author). I wrote it in the book because of the need of the people of our time for it, for the affliction has become general by mixing with them and being friendly to them by the ignorant and others from the people of farming and agriculture, and those who put themselves under their mandates due to exchange or extracting money and the like - we ask Allah for safety and well-being from that, and to Him belongs praise and favor. We say: Praise be to Allah who saved us from what He tested many of His creation with. Allah said: (And [mention, O Muhammad], when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, [saying], \"You must make it clear to the people and not conceal it.\") This verse is short and its words are few. I hope, God willing, for whoever Allah qualifies to stand upon it and act according to what is in it, the attainment of great good for him and for the Muslims in the immediate and the future; so let him not return to the whispering of Satan in delaying looking into it, reviewing it time after time, and acting according to what is in it, for he is an enemy flowing through you like blood. Allah Almighty said: (Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy). He Almighty said: (So give good tidings to My servants Who listen to speech and follow the best of it. Those are the ones Allah has guided, and those are people of understanding). He Almighty said: (And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong). He Almighty said: ([And they are] those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong). He Almighty said: (O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones). He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"You must enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, or Allah will seal your hearts, then you will be among the heedless.\" Allah Almighty explained in another verse the state of those whose hearts were sealed and became heedless, so He Almighty said: (Those are the ones over whose hearts and hearing and vision Allah has sealed, and it is those who are the heedless. Assuredly, it is they in the Hereafter who will be the losers).",

    "text": "In the Hadith: \"If Allah intends good for a servant, He sends him someone to remind him if he forgets. And if He intends evil for him, He sends him an evil companion who forbids him from taking advice.\" When Harun al-Rashid took power, he sat for the people in a public gathering. Bahlul the Madman entered upon him and said: O Commander of the Faithful, beware of evil companions, and rely on a righteous companion who reminds you of the virtues of character if you forget, and looking at whom reminds you if you are heedless. For this is a benefit for you and the people, and greater in reward than what you bring of fasting, prayer, reading, and Hajj. A man throws a word before a ruler, and he acts upon it, filling the earth with corruption. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"A man speaks a word, not giving it importance, and he falls by it into the Fire for seventy autumns.\" Do not be, O Commander of the Faithful, like those about whom Allah Almighty said: (And when it is said to him, \"Fear Allah,\" pride in the sin takes hold of him. Sufficient for him is Hellfire, and wretched is the resting place). He said to him: Increase me. He said: O Commander of the Faithful, Allah Almighty has led the people to you and made your command obeyed among them, your word effective among them, and your order executed among them. That is only so you carry them to perform what Allah commanded, and desist from what Allah forbade, and give from this wealth to the widow, the orphan, the elder, and the wayfarer. O Commander of the Faithful, so-and-so informed me from so-and-so from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"When it is the Day of Resurrection and Allah gathers the first and the last on one plain, He brings the kings and others, and the rulers of people's affairs, and He says to them: I did not enable you in My lands and make My servants obey you to gather wealth and mobilize men, but to gather them for My obedience, execute My command and prohibition among them, honor My allies, humiliate My enemies, and support the oppressed against the oppressors.\" O Harun, think about how your answer will be in that position when you are brought with your hands tied to your neck, Hellfire before you, and the Angels of Punishment surrounding you waiting for what will be ordered regarding you!! Harun wept intensely! Some of those present said to him: You have troubled the Commander of the Faithful in his gathering! Harun said to them: - May Allah fight you - Indeed the deceived is he whom you deceived, and the happy one is he whom you stayed away from. Then he left his presence.

    "text": "Some scholars said: It is not permissible for the money changer of the treasury to be a Dhimmi, because his word is not accepted regarding whether it (money) is good or bad; because it involves interest (usury/pasture?), so how about employment which texts have demonstrated its prevention? Allah Almighty said: (And I was not to take the misguiders as supporters). And He Almighty said: (O Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them). If your Lord commanded harshness, how can you bring them close and make them rulers? And He Almighty said: (O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them). And He Almighty said: (O you who have believed, if you support Allah, He will support you and plant firmly your feet). And He Almighty said: (O you who have believed, do not take as intimates those other than yourselves, for they will not spare you [any] ruin. They wish you would have hardship. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater. We have certainly made clear to you the signs, if you will use reason). Intimates (Bitana) means: Those who see the state of Muslims, like knowing the amount of their treasury funds or the count of their army of men. His saying: (La ya'lunakum khabalan) means: They do not fall short, and 'Khabal' is corruption; i.e., they do not fall short and strive to bring corruption to you. His saying: (Waddu ma 'anittum): 'Al-'Anat' is harm and the like. i.e., They wish for your harm. So reflect on this great verse. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever is given charge of a matter of my nation's affairs and does not advise them, and does not strive (for them), Paradise is forbidden to him.\" Thus he made striving obligatory in selecting the fit when equal in fitness. He said: \"Whoever appoints a person over a matter of my nation's affairs while thinking there is someone better than him among them has betrayed Allah and His Messenger.\" Employing disbelievers involves great corruptions, ugly matters, and heinous conditions that an enemy would not wish for his enemy, especially for the enemy of Muslims to wish for the nation of Muhammad, peace be upon him. Among them is their claim that the lands belong to them until now and that Muslims expelled them from them without right, so they steal funds as much as they can, believing they didn't betray or oppress. They see enduring confiscation and punishment as enduring sickness that may befall health. They advise each other to be patient with punishment and show endurance. If forced to give, they bring out the very least, give some of it, and bribe ('Bartalu') with some until they are free. Whoever is in this state in his belief and action, it is not lawful for anyone to appoint him. Among them is that many of the Muslim lands allocated for Muslim interests, current in the fiefs of princes and soldiers, as well as charities endowed for the Muslim poor like a recovered town and others, they divert to themselves, and to churches and monasteries, even though it is not permissible to spend any of that on them. He (the ruler) was able to cut it off but did not, enabling them to take it and giving them power over it; he is liable for it in this world and accountable for it on the Day of Resurrection. Their condition in this trait has become obscene until it exceeded to salaries and provisions current for the interests of mosques. They induce the Prince they work with to cut them off by every way they can, showing saving for him and compassion, then after that they divert them to themselves and their churches. Many of the old Omari mosques have been ruined. The one aiding them in this enters under the severe threat in His saying: (And who is more unjust than he who prevents the name of Allah from being mentioned in His mosques). Among them: They devise stratagems at every time to burn grand mosques, mosques, and Muslim properties, causing crowds of men, women, and children to burn. This happened recently in the \"Year of Al-Ghaffar\", the year forty-seven. They were caught and confessed against a group of officials that they helped them. They devised a trick by giving some of what they stole with the help of their elders and those in power among them, so they escaped and no harm touched any of them. If that had happened to a Sharif (noble/Muslim), punishment beyond description would have befallen him. Reflect - may Allah grant you success - on these corruptions and ponder them, while the properties they burned are ruins until now, witnessed. So take lesson, O people of vision. All this is a realization of His Almighty's saying: (They will not spare you [any] ruin), i.e., they do not fall short in bringing corruption to you. End of the words of Sheikh Jamal al-Din, may Allah have mercy on him. Imitating Christians in their Festivals and Seasons: Our Sheikh said: Among the innovations is what is done on \"Nayruz\" of foods, drinks, and corruptions, for that is agreeing with Christians in their festivals and seasons. It is not permissible to agree with them in any of that. It is not permissible to agree with them in seasons in eating milk and others, and what is done of \"Sun descent from cutting Karkish\", \"Dark Saturday\". All that is forbidden innovation; it is forbidden for a Muslim to participate with them in any of it, and to accept their gift in their seasons unlike other times.

Al-Baghawi said: He means by 'Sahib al-Maks': The one who takes from merchants when they pass by him a 'Maks' (tax) in the name of the tithe ('Ushr). Al-Hafiz said: As for now, they take a 'Maks' in the name of the tithe and other taxes that have no name, but are something they take unlawfully and as Suht (illicit gain), eating fire in their bellies. Their argument in it is refuted with their Lord, upon them is wrath, and for them is a severe punishment. From Al-Hasan, he said: Uthman bin Abi Al-Aas passed by Kilab bin Umayyah who was sitting at the place of the tithe collector in Basra. He said: What makes you sit here? He said: He employed me in this place - meaning Ziyad. Uthman said to him: Shall I not tell you a Hadith I heard from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him? He said: Yes. Uthman said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, saying: \"David, the Prophet of Allah, used to have an hour in which he woke his family saying: O family of David, get up and pray, for this is an hour in which Allah answers supplication except for a magician or a tithe collector ('Ashshar).\" So Ibn Umayyah boarded his ship, came to Ziyad, asked to be relieved, and he relieved him. Narrated by Ahmad and Al-Tabarani in Al-Kabir and Al-Awsat. His wording from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The gates of heaven are opened at midnight, and a caller calls: Is there any supplicant so he may be answered? Is there any asker so he may be given? Is there any distressed person so his distress may be relieved? There remains no Muslim invoking with a supplication but Allah answers him, except a prostitute running with her private parts or a tithe collector ('Ashshar).\" In another narration by him in Al-Kabir also: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, saying: \"Verily, Allah draws near to His creation and forgives whoever asks for forgiveness except a prostitute with her private parts or a tithe collector.\" From Abu Al-Khayr, he said: Maslamah bin Mukhallad, who was the Emir of Egypt, offered Ruwayfi' bin Thabit to appoint him over the tithe. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: \"The owner of the tax (Maks) is in the Fire.\" Narrated by Ahmad from the narration of Ibn Lahi'ah and Al-Tabarani similarly. It was narrated from Umm Salamah, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was in the desert when a caller called: O Messenger of Allah. He turned and saw no one. Then he turned and saw a tied gazelle. She said: Come near me, O Messenger of Allah. He came near her and said: What is your need? She said: I have two fawns in this mountain, so untie me until I go and suckle them, then I will return to you. He said: And you will do it?! She said: May Allah punish me with the punishment of the tithe collector ('Ashshar) if I do not come to you. So he released her, she went, suckled her fawns, then returned, and he tied her up. The Bedouin woke up and said: Do you have a need, O Messenger of Allah? He said: Yes, release this one. So he released her, and she went out running saying: I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\" Narrated by Al-Tabarani. Explanation of 'Urafa' (Monitors/Leaders): From Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: \"Woe to the 'Urafa', woe to the trustees (Umana'). People on the Day of Resurrection will wish their forelocks were suspended from the Pleiades, dangling between heaven and earth, and that they had not worked on anything.\" Narrated by Ahmad. In a Hadith: \"The 'Urafa' are in the Fire, and the gambling is in the Fire.\" From Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Woe to the Emirs, woe to the 'Urafa'. People on the Day of Resurrection will wish their forelocks were suspended from the Pleiades, dangling between heaven and earth, and that they had not worked on anything.\" Narrated by Ibn Hibban in his Sahih and Al-Hakim. Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated saying: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"In the Fire is a stone called 'Wayl' (Woe) upon which the 'Urafa' ascend and descend.\" From Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, that a funeral passed by the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said: \"Good for him if he was not an 'Arif' (Monitor).\" Narrated by Abu Ya'la and its chain is Hasan, God willing. From Al-Miqdam bin Ma'dikarib, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, tapped on his shoulders then said: \"You have succeeded, O Qadim, if you die and were not an Emir, nor a scribe, nor an 'Arif'.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood. From Mawdud bin Al-Harith bin Yazid bin Kurayb bin Yazid bin Yusuf bin Haritha Al-Yarbu'i from his father from his grandfather that he came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, a man from Tamim went away with all my money.\" The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to me: \"I do not have what to give you. Then he said: Will you be an 'Arif' over your people or shall I not introduce you to your brothers? I said: No. He said: Indeed the 'Arif' is pushed into the Fire with a push.\" Narrated by Al-Tabarani, and I do not know Mawdud.?",

    "text": "From Abu Sa'id and Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with them both, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Emirs will surely come over you who bring near the evil people and delay the prayer from its times. So whoever catches that, let him not be an 'Arif' (monitor), nor a policeman (Shurti), nor a collector (Jabi), nor a treasurer.\" Narrated by Ibn Hibban in his Sahih. I took all these Hadiths from 'Al-Targhib wa Al-Tarhib'. ? Chapter ??? On Ghayrah (Jealousy/Protectiveness). Allah Almighty said: (Say, \"My Lord has only forbidden immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed\"). Ghayrah is of six types; for each type there is evidence from the Quran which we summarized for fear of prolongation: First: Ghayrah over the actions of bodies, that they be used to serve other than Allah Almighty. Second: Ghayrah over the sayings of the tongue, that other than Him be mentioned by it, so none is invoked but Him and none is mentioned but Him. Third: Ghayrah over the thoughts of the heart (Janan), that other than Him crosses it, so none is watched but Him and none looks upon it but Him. Fourth: Ghayrah over the whisperings of consciences, that other than Him is found in them. Fifth: Ghayrah over the hidden secrets (Sara'ir), that they contain other than Him; so they are not occupied except with Him and are not sincere except to Him. Sixth: Ghayrah over the secrets of secrets, that other than Him views them, and they are not revealed except from Him, and are not pure except [for] Him. Know that Ghayrah is the dislike of sharing. Then Ghayrah is of two kinds: Ghayrah of the Truth (Allah) for the servant: It is that He protects him so He does not give creation a way over his actions, sayings, deeds, breaths, senses, secrets, and conscience. And Ghayrah of the servant for the Truth (Allah): It is that he specializes in magnifying His rights and is sincere in classifying his knowledge, so he does not give creation a way or share in his states. It is not said: He had Ghayrah *over* Allah because that is ignorance and leaving religion, but it is said: He had Ghayrah *for* Allah. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"No one has more Ghayrah than Allah, Majestic is His Majesty, and because of that He forbade immoralities, what is apparent of them and what is concealed.\" He, peace be upon him, said: \"Verily Allah Almighty has Ghayrah, and Allah's Ghayrah is that the servant commits what Allah forbade upon him.\" Ma'ruf al-Karkhi - Allah's mercy be upon him - said: The sign of Allah Almighty's hatred for the servant is that you see him busy with what does not concern him. Ishaq bin Ibrahim said: I heard Al-Fudayl bin Iyad - Allah Almighty's mercy be upon him - [saying]: You ask Him for Paradise, and you commit what He dislikes; I have not seen one with less vision than you! Ghayrah of the Truth is that He is not pleased with the sharing of others in what is His right from the obediences of His servant. Ibrahim bin Adham said: Ghayrah is to migrate from other than Him until one reaches the station of intimacy and stands between fear and hope. It was said: Rabi'ah al-Adawiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, fell ill. It was said to her: What is the cause of your illness? She said: I looked at other than Him, so He disciplined me with Ghayrah so that I might not return. Abu Abdullah al-Husri said: I saw in the desert a barefoot boy walking with great effort, and that was pleasant to his heart in what he was in of witnessing intimacy and connection. I said: O my son, how is the way? He said: Here, and pointed to the sky. I said: How? He said: The universes are all a veil in knowing the Kingdom (Malakut). He said: I found my heart with his words, so I held on to my rags weeping and sobbing. He said: Take from me, for He is Ghayur (possessor of Ghayrah); He destroyed whom He destroyed for their looking at others (Aghyar), and misled whom He misled for their tearing the veils of secrets. Then he disappeared from me as if he were an angel who admonished me and left. So repent to Allah, beware of Allah's Ghayrah, and bind your heart to fear, and fear of Istidraj (gradual lure to destruction). Allah Almighty said: (We will progressively lead them [to destruction] from where they do not know). Chapter: On Fleeing (Firar). Allah Almighty said: (So flee to Allah). Those who flee are of three categories: Allah Almighty has described each one of them with a description. A category of them are those intending to flee to Allah Almighty, and they are: The Repentant, Regretful. The second: Are those walking the paths of fleeing to Allah Almighty, and they are: The Knowers (Gnostics), Confessors. And the third: Are those who arrived to Allah Almighty, and they are: The Pious (Muttaqun). Know that fleeing is of types: First: Fleeing from the world to the Master (Mawla). Second: Fleeing from Satan to the Master. Third: Fleeing from the self (Nafs) to the Master. Fourth: Fleeing from desire (Hawa) to the Master. Fifth: Fleeing from desires (Muna) to the Master. Sixth: Fleeing from the heart to the Master. Seventh: Fleeing from Allah to Allah. Abu al-Abbas said: Fleeing is four: Fleeing from creation, fleeing from the self, fleeing from the heart to Allah, and fleeing from Allah to Allah. All is gathered by (So flee). Sahl bin Abdullah said: So flee to Allah from Him, and from what is other than Allah to Allah. Sufyan said: So flee from ignorance of Allah to knowledge of Allah.",

    "text": "Yahya bin Mu'adh said: Our God, our bodies are captives of the world, and our hearts are captives of desire. Between that, we are taken by commands and prohibitions, wishing for purity for an hour of time, or to flee to Your door with sincerity for a moment of our lives, writing with tears the story of humility, and extending the hand of servitude to the glory of Lordship, but we are unable to do that. Here we are standing in the position of apology, confession, and drawing near (If You punish them, indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them, indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise). So upon you, O my brother, is truthfulness (Sidq) with Allah Almighty in what was mentioned and what will be mentioned. Truthfulness is the pillar of action, and truthfulness with Allah drives one to leave what Allah Almighty dislikes. Allah Almighty said: (O you who have believed, fear Allah and be with those who are true). The truthful are three: Truthful in his actions, truthful in his words, and truthful in his states. As for the truthful in his actions, he has six signs: Manifesting repentance, constant weeping, frequent humility, persistence in effort, correctness of observation (Muraqaba), and rushing to commands while avoiding prohibitions. The truthful in his states: has six signs: Asceticism in the world, giving when spending, altruism with necessity, good character, correctness of reliance (Tawakkul), and speaking the truth and knowing it. As for the truthful in his words: he has six signs: Standing before fear and hope, training the self with piety, certainty, performing gratitude, patience, observing modesty (Haya'), sincerity, acting with submission, and satisfaction with good manners on the carpet of openness (Inbisat). Abu Abdullah said: He was asked what is the best thing a servant directs to Allah? He said: Truthfulness, and the ugliest is lying. Yahya bin Mu'adh used to say in holding himself accountable: O you whom death is behind and hope is in front, nothing saves you but the truthfulness of action. Ahmad bin Hadrawayh said: Whoever wants Allah to be with him, let him stick to truthfulness. This speech was said by the verifiers (Muhaqqiqun) - may Allah be pleased with us and them and benefit us with their knowledge. Explanation of Intercourse with a Woman in her Anus, which is of the Major Sins: Allah Almighty said: (And they ask you about menstruation. Say, \"It is harm, so keep away from wives during menstruation. And do not approach them until they are pure. And when they have purified themselves, then come to them from where Allah has ordained for you.\") And Almighty said: (Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish). 'Al-Harth' (Tilth): Water (semen) is in the place of sowing. From Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said regarding the one who comes to a woman in her anus: \"It is the lesser sodomy.\" From Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Allah does not look at a man who came to a man or a woman in the anus.\" Narrated by Al-Tirmidhi and he said: A strange (Gharib) Hadith. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever comes to a menstruating woman or a woman in her anus or a soothsayer and believes him has disbelieved.\" He said: \"And has disavowed what Allah revealed to Muhammad.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood and Al-Tirmidhi. Chapter: On the meaning of His saying (Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish). Meaning facing forward, backward, and lying down, meaning by that in the place of the child (vagina). These Hadiths are text on the permissibility of all states and positions if the tilth is in the place of sowing, which is the vagina, i.e., however you wish from behind and from front, kneeling or lying down, if he wishes crouching (Mujabbiyah), and if he wishes not crouching, that is in one valve (Simam). It is narrated \"In one Sam\" with Sin, said Al-Tirmidhi. Al-Nasa'i narrated from Abu Al-Nadr that he said to Nafi', the freed slave of Ibn Umar: It has been much said about you that you say on the authority of Ibn Umar that he gave a fatwa that women be approached in their anuses. Nafi' said: They have lied about me, but I will tell you how the matter was. Ibn Umar was reciting the Mushaf one day while I was with him until he reached (Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you). Nafi' said: Do you know what the matter of this verse is? We, the people of Quraysh, used to make women crouch (Najbi). When we entered Medina and married the women of the Ansar, we wanted from them what we wanted from our women, but they disliked that and considered it grave. The women of the Ansar used to be approached only on their sides. So Allah revealed (Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you). From Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Jews used to say: If a man comes to his wife from her rear into her front (vagina) then she conceives, her child will be cross-eyed. So (Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish) was revealed. He added in a narration from Al-Tirmidhi: \"Meaning one valve.\" Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. From Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him: \"Whoever comes to women in their anuses and the man (homosexuality), then he is a disbeliever.\" And from him also: \"Cursed is the one who comes to a woman in her anus.\" Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Be shy of Allah, for Allah is not shy of the truth; do not come to women in their anuses.\" Explanation of the Prohibition of Approaching Women during Menstruation and the Permissibility of Enjoying them between the Navel and the Knee.",

    "text": "Allah Almighty said: (And they ask you about menstruation) (And do not approach them until they are pure. And when they have purified themselves) meaning with water, she performs Ghusl like the Ghusl (for impurities). He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Do everything except intercourse.\" Consensus has been established on the prohibition of intercourse in the vagina. What is below the vagina is also forbidden, meaning the anus. Whoever deems it lawful disbelieves. Whoever has intercourse with his wife during menstruation gets a painful ailment. Allah Almighty said: (And they ask you about menstruation. Say, \"It is harm\") so He explained to them the harm resulting from it. As for expiation (Kaffarah) and discretionary punishment (Ta'zir), our Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Know that intercourse in the vagina during menstruation is forbidden by the agreement of scholars. The doer of that sins and commits a major sin. The ruler punishes him with what he sees as a deterrent punishment, and no Hadd (prescribed punishment) or Kaffarah is obligatory on him. From Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him: \"Whoever has intercourse with a woman while she is menstruating and a child is decreed between them and he is afflicted with leprosy, let him blame no one but himself.\" In the old school (of Shafi'i), if he has intercourse at the time of its weakness (end of period), he must give half a Dinar in charity. As for enjoyment between the navel and the knee, there are two views. One is that it is forbidden, which is intercourse. If he touches above the navel and below the knee, it is permissible. If he enjoys the navel and knee themselves, Al-Nawawi said: The chosen view is its permissibility. It is forbidden to sleep with her in one quilt without enjoyment between the navel and the knee, and this is if she is wrapped in a waistcloth. Explanation of the Prohibition of Lesbianism (Sihaq) among Women: It is among the major sins, which is a woman coming to a woman. From Wathilah bin Al-Asqa', he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Sihaq is the adultery of women among themselves.\" He, peace and blessings be upon him, also said: \"The Awrah of a woman to a woman is like the Awrah of a man to a man.\" He also said: \"No woman shall touch another woman unless they are two adulteresses.\" He also said: \"Three, Allah does not accept from them the saying 'La ilaha illa Allah': The mounter and the mounted (male), the mounter and the mounted (female), and the unjust Imam.\" Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"If men satisfy themselves with men and women with women, then swallowing (by earth), transformation, and bombardment from the sky will occur.\" Ata' said: From Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"A time will come upon people when boys are married and women are not married, and jealousy is shown over boys as it is shown over women.\" In this sin is discretionary punishment (Ta'zir) according to what deters its doer. Sheikh Taqi al-Din al-Hisni, may Allah have mercy on him, said in the explanation of Abu Shuja's book: Lesbianism of women for women is forbidden and they are punished for it because it is a forbidden act. Judge Abu al-Tayyib, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Its sin is like the sin of adultery because of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"If a woman comes to a woman, they are two adulteresses.\" In the tradition: If a woman mounts a woman, Allah Almighty commands an angel to place upon her seventy cloaks of fire and a shield of fire. Explanation of Effeminacy (Takhannuth) in Men and What it Entails: The meaning of Takhannuth is: A man resembling a woman in her speech, dress, and all her states. It is among the major sins necessitating cursing for resembling a woman. Likewise, a woman resembling a man, based on the Hadith. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, cursed the effeminate men and the masculine women.\" It is an authentic Hadith. Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, cursed the man who wears the clothing of a woman, and the woman who wears the clothing of a man.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood with an authentic chain. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Two types of the people of Hellfire I have not seen: A people with whips like the tails of cows beating the people with them, and women who are clothed yet naked, inclining and inclined, their heads like the humps of Bukht camels leaning. They will not enter Paradise nor smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be found from such and such distance.\" Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih.",

    "text": "\"Notice\" The affliction has become general in our time with what is more severe than that, which is that a woman puts on her head something called \"Taqiyah\" and \"Qubba'ah\" so it becomes like a plate or a minaret. On the head of some of them is something resembling a small waterskin. Perhaps these caps are wrapped with handkerchiefs until they become like a turban, so she enters into resembling men. Thus, the threat of the Hadith applies to her as well. This results in shortening the waist-wrapper and tucking it up contrary to custom due to the height of this calamity she placed on her head, so that her clothes, slippers, and dress are revealed from under the waist-wrapper. As for his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Clothed yet naked\": There is disagreement on the saying: Clothed yet naked. It was said: Clothed in Allah's blessings, naked of gratitude for them. It was said: They wear thin clothes that describe the skin. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Verily, men perished when they obeyed women.\" Sa'id bin al-Musayyib, may Allah have mercy on him, narrated from Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him: \"Four walk while Allah is angry with them: Those men resembling women, those women resembling men, he who mates with an animal, and he who does the deed of the people of Lot.\" It is mentioned from Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: \"The Messenger of Allah cursed the house which effeminate men enter.\" And from him also that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, \"cursed the effeminate men and the masculine women.\" He said: \"Expel them from your houses, so expel so-and-so and so-and-so.\" Ahmad and Ishaq, may Allah have mercy on them, stated the banishment of the effeminate. \"Notice\" On the Prohibition of Associating with Youths and Looking at Them. Abu Zakariya al-Nawawi said in his Fatawa: \"Question\" Is looking at a beardless boy (Amrad) lawful or not? If a man loves beardless boys, spends his money on them, and it is easy for him to give one of them a large sum, but difficult for him to give a dirham to a poor needy man with a family, is his meeting with them and spending in this way forbidden for him? And if he gathers them, is he sinful or not? Does the probity (Adalah) of one who gathers them and persists in that drop or not? Did any scholar say this is permissible or not? The Answer: Mere looking at a beautiful beardless boy is forbidden whether with desire or otherwise, unless there is a legal need like buying, medical treatment, teaching, etc. Then the amount of need is permissible, and excess is forbidden. Allah Almighty said: (Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision). He, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, and other scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, stated the prohibition of looking at him without a legal need. They argued with the noble verse, and that he is in the meaning of a woman, rather some of them are more beautiful than many women. And because what is possible regarding a woman and facilitated by way of marriage and legal intercourse is not facilitated regarding him, so he is (more worthy of) prohibition. The sayings of the Salaf in alienating from them and warning against seeing them are more than can be counted. They called them \"The Stinking Ones\" (Al-Antan); because they are filthy legally. Whether what we mentioned is the look of one attributed to righteousness or otherwise. As for being alone (Khalwah) with a beardless boy, it is more severely forbidden than looking at him because it is more obscene and closer to evil, whether one attributed to righteousness is alone with him or otherwise. As for gathering beardless boys in the mentioned manner, it is forbidden for the gatherer and the attendee. Spending money on that is forbidden, strictly forbidden. Whoever gathers them and persists becomes a sinner (Fasiq), his testimony is rejected, and his guardianship drops. The guardian of the beardless boy - may Allah guide him - must prevent them from that. Every responsible person (Mukallaf) who knows the state of these people must denounce them according to his ability. Whoever is unable to denounce them but can raise their case to the ruler must do so. None of the scholars, may Allah Almighty have mercy on them, said this is permissible in this manner.

    "text": "Our Sheikh said in his book 'Tuhfat al-Abrar': Know that whoever prepares something hoping to obtain it is called hopeful (Raji). Likewise, whoever obeys Allah hoping for acceptance or repents hoping for forgiveness. As for whoever persists in negligence and hopes for His forgiveness, he is deluded, not hopeful. He, peace be upon him, said: \"The wise is he who holds himself accountable and works for what is after death, and the incapable is he who follows his self's desires and wishes [vain] wishes upon Allah.\" As for fear, it is the expectation of a felony [punishment]. Every favored person should be fearful of punishment, and it may occur from precedence (past decree) or from the conclusion (end of life). A believer must have fear. Al-Darami said: Every heart that has no fear in it is ruined. Fear may lead to anxiety and weeping. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to pray while a sound like the boiling of a pot came from his chest. He, peace be upon him, said: \"When I was taken on the Night Journey, I saw Gabriel, peace be upon him, like a worn-out saddlecloth thrown down out of fear of Allah Almighty.\" Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, used to say: \"Would that I were a tree cut down and not eaten.\" Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, passed by a straw and said: Would that I were this straw. Ali said on the Day of the Camel: \"I wish I had died twenty years before this day.\" Abu Ubaidah said: \"I would have liked to be a ram, slaughtered by my family, who ate my meat and drank my broth.\" Ibn Mas'ud said: \"If I stood between Paradise and Hell and was given the choice between them or becoming dust, I would choose to be dust.\" Imran bin Husain said: \"Would that I were ashes scattered by the winds.\" Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said: \"Would that I were a thing forgotten and unnoticed.\" The fear of the Salaf and their weeping is famous. Yazid bin Hawshab said: I have not seen anyone more fearful than Al-Hasan and Umar bin Abd al-Aziz, as if Hell was not created except for them. The Knowers said: A servant must have equal fear and hope while in good health. In sickness, his hope should be [dominant]. In the state of falling into sin, he should be fearful, for it is more helpful in repelling sin. Know, O my brother, that if the heart is devoid of fear, it is ruined. Fear is a driver that drives and hinders: it drives to obedience and hinders from disobedience. My master Abd al-Aziz al-Dirini said: Fear has meanings: fear of Fire, fear of ruin, fear of precedence (decree), and fear of the conclusion (Khatimah). We ask Allah Almighty for a good conclusion. Chapter: Explanation of Sins. Sheikh Abd al-Aziz, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Know that sins are of two types: abandoning an obligation and committing a prohibition.",

    "text": "The first of them - the sin of Iblis, for it is abandoning an obligation. He was commanded to prostrate, but he did not prostrate. And the sin of Adam, he was forbidden from eating from the tree, but he ate. Then it is divided into what is the right of Allah, and what is the right of a human. Then it is divided in terms of its origins into four sections: Lordly (Rububiyyah), Satanic (Shaytoniyyah), Bestial (Bahimiyyah), and Predatory (Sab'iyyah). Lordly: Resembling the attributes of the Lord, Glory be to Him. So whoever among creation resembles them by being arrogant, tyrannical, seeking elevation, loftiness, praise, and dominance over creation, has disputed Lordship its right. Satanic: Resembling Satan. Among his attributes are envy, transgression, trickery, deception, cheating, hypocrisy, and calling to sins, innovations, and misguidance. Bestial: Lust and greed to satisfy the desire of the stomach and genitals. From it branch out adultery, theft, eating the orphan's money, and gathering unlawful wealth to satisfy desires. Predatory: Anger and hatred. From it branch out arrogance, beating, and harming creation. The first thing that dominates man is the Bestial. When he grows and his understanding increases, the Predatory enters him. If his thinking strengthens and he is not guided, he uses his mind in plotting, deception, and Satanic attributes. Then disputing Lordship enters him. Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said: (Pride is My cloak and Greatness is My lower garment, so whoever disputes with Me in one of them, I will throw him into the Fire). End of the words of my master Abd al-Aziz. Ibn al-Qayyim said: Imam Ahmad mentioned from Wahb: That the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, said in some of what He says to the Children of Israel: \"Indeed, if I am obeyed I am pleased, and if I am pleased I bless, and there is no end to My blessing. And if I am disobeyed I get angry, and if I get angry I curse, and My curse reaches the seventh child.\" Abu Nu'aym mentioned from Salim bin Abi al-Ja'd: A person might find the hearts of believers cursing him from where he does not perceive. Then he said: Do you know why this is? I said: No. He said: The servant secludes himself with sins against Allah, so Allah casts hatred for him into the hearts of believers from where he does not perceive. He also mentioned from Waki', Zakariya bin Amir told us, he said: Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, wrote to Muawiyah, may Allah be pleased with him: As for what follows... If a servant commits a sin, his praiser among people turns into a blamer. Abdullah son of Imam Ahmad mentioned in his book 'Al-Zuhd' for his father from Muhammad bin Sirin that when debt overwhelmed him, he was distressed by that and said: I know this distress is due to a sin I committed forty years ago. Here is a subtle point where people err regarding sin: They do not see its effect immediately, and its effect may be delayed so it is forgotten, and the servant thinks that it will not change after that, and that the matter is as the poet said: If you do not change a wall when it falls... It has no dust after falling. Glory be to Allah! How many creatures has this calamity destroyed, how many blessings has it removed, how many vengeances has it brought! How many are deluded by it, let alone the ignorant! He did not know that sin breaks down even after a while, just as poison breaks down, and just as a wound healed over corruption and bad matter breaks down. End of Ibn al-Qayyim's words.

    "text": "My master Abd al-Aziz al-Dirini, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his book 'Al-Rawdah Al-Aniqa': Chapter on incidents that occurred in our time: Know that what called for writing this summary is that a people in this time innovated a path contrary to the path of the [righteous] people, claiming they have good intentions in it. Among them: Seclusion with women, talking with them, and some perhaps added hugging, kissing, and touching with foreign women (non-Mahram). Others followed a similar path with youths. This is not hidden from a person of intellect as being from Satan's tricks and plots, and his snares and traps. Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said addressing the Companions of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him - despite their rank - regarding the wives of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him - despite their rank as Mothers of Believers in sanctity and prohibition, nay greater than them in reverence and honor - (And when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts). So whoever claims he is stronger in faith than the Companions, or that the women he secludes with are purer in heart and more self-controlled than the wives of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, has magnified fabrication and increased audacity regarding the Hadith of seclusion alone, so how about what exceeds that? In the Hadith, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was performing I'tikaf in Ramadan when his wife Hafsa bint Umar entered upon him. She spoke with him for an hour then went out. He saw two men on the road and said: She is your mother Hafsa. They said: Glory be to Allah, O Messenger of Allah! He said: \"Indeed Satan flows through the son of Adam like blood, and I feared he might cast something into your hearts.\" If the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, feared Satan would cast into people's souls that a foreign woman was with him, how can anyone else be safe from people suspecting him?! It was narrated from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"Do not be alone with a woman even if you teach her the Quran.\" It was narrated that women gathered around him asking to pledge allegiance by hand. He said: My hand does not touch the hand of a woman, but my saying to one woman is like my saying to a hundred women. So he pledged allegiance to them by speech without touching. It was narrated that when they asked for \"Blessing\", he put his hand in water then transferred it to them, and they put their hands in it. If the Master of the first and last avoided these matters, and others rush into what is greater than them, how can the ugliness of what they undertake be hidden from a sane person? We ask Allah for safety by His grace and generosity. Greater than that is their denial of those who avoid these ugly acts, saying: \"You are weak of heart.\" Nothing is weak but their faith. And their saying: \"Nothing harms the Faqir (Sufi/Poor one).\" This is false, for prohibitions are not specific to one without another. If they meant the Faqir does not fall into sin, they have lied, for these things are sins in themselves. So how can it be said to one who disobeyed that he did not disobey? If they meant by change that Allah's blessing on him or the succession of lights and unveiling to him [continues], this is a great error. For openings (Futuhat), miracles (Karamat), and good times are only a sign of nearness if their owner is upright on the path of verification. As for their appearance with confusion and violation of Sharia, it is a sign of plotting and Istidraj (gradual lure) as Allah Almighty said: (We will progressively lead them from where they do not know). As for their saying: Some women and youths have the intention of acquiring knowledge or etiquette (Adab), and if all people avoided associating with women and youths, none of them would acquire knowledge or etiquette. The answer is that teaching and discipline is specific to the knowing scholars. So how can one who has no knowledge or gnosis intend to teach others? This is a great rank not suitable except for those firmly grounded in knowledge and gnosis. Then, even for one suitable for this, it is not lawful for him to increase the meeting with women and youths beyond what need calls for. That is, the meeting should not be in seclusion, nor with openness and joy, but he should speak only in seriousness, firmness, admonition, and knowledge. He should not prolong the look, and if able, not look at all. I saw some of our knowing scholar Sheikhs habituate himself to lower his gaze from men, and it became a habit for him which he did not have to force with women. There was kinship between him and women near us, so he used to visit them to uphold ties of kinship, and I was with him. He would stand at the door of the house until the woman came out to him, greet her from afar, lower his gaze, and leave. So how can one be safe who enters their husbands' houses without permission, eats their food, then becomes informal, goes out, opens his eyes, and extends his hands? Perhaps he adds more than this. It is reported in the Sahih: \"The eyes, their adultery is looking; the ears, their adultery is listening; and the hands, their adultery is touching.\" All these actions are adultery. Is adultery lawful with a good intention? Are intentions considered in prohibitions? The Hadith was narrated regarding permissible acts and obediences. For the permissible, if done with a good intention, becomes obedience. And obedience, if there is no sincerity of intention for Allah in it, is showing off (Riya'). This is the meaning of the saying of",

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Actions are by intentions.\" As for prohibitions, they are sins, and if one intends a good intention by them, he is an ignorant sinner. Chapter: On False Claims. A group increased and claimed that their meeting with women and youths, and engaging in these matters, brings blessing, and that the proximity of a woman and a youth to a righteous man is a cause for the life of the heart, for light flows from heart to heart, and similar false adornments! These are a group who resembled devils, for Satan beautifies impossible things with prohibited matters and adorns them with false images. This is a trick of debauchery, a trick of plotting, and a deceit of lying. Would that these people, since they fell into these uglinesses, did not add to them what is uglier; for the one who knows and confesses his sin is lighter in sin and less in crime. Whoever has a wife must deter these people with a healing punishment and sufficient restraint. If he cannot do that, let him forbid them sufficiently. If they do not accept, denouncing them with the heart becomes obligatory, as the Almighty said: (Leave them to eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by hope, for they are going to know). End. Chapter: On Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil. Allah Almighty said: (And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful). Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted, commanded in this verse explicitly to enjoin good and forbid evil. He praised in another verse those who enjoin good and forbid evil, saying: (You were the best nation produced for mankind). He said in the verse describing the believers: (Enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong). In the Hadith: \"You will surely enjoin good and forbid evil, and you will surely take the hand of the oppressor, and you will surely bend him to the truth bending, and you will surely restrict him to the truth restricting, or Allah will surely strike the hearts of some of you against others, then He will surely curse you as He cursed them.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood. In the Hadith also: \"Whoever among you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; if he cannot, then with his tongue; if he cannot, then with his heart, and that is the weakest of faith.\" From Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you will surely enjoin good and forbid evil, or else Allah will soon send upon you a punishment, then you will call upon Him and He will not answer you.\" So the Book and the Sunnah established the obligation of enjoining good and forbidding evil, and the Hadiths on that are many. Scholars said: Allah Almighty made enjoining good and forbidding evil a distinction between believers and hypocrites because Allah Almighty said: (The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right). And the Almighty said: (The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong). Thus it is established that the most specific characteristic of believers and the strongest indication of the soundness of their belief and the safety of their secrets is enjoining good and forbidding evil. However, this is not something suitable for everyone, nor obligatory on everyone. Rather, it is one of the duties that the Sultan should perform for Muslims if the establishment of Hadd punishments is up to him, and discretionary punishment is entrusted to his opinion. So he appoints in every city and every village a righteous man, strong in faith, knowledgeable, and orders him to observe the conditions that occur. So he sees no evil and hears no evil except that he changes it, and leaves no good needing to be ordered except that he orders it. Whenever a Hadd is obligatory on a sinner, he establishes it and does not suspend it, for nothing is more disgracing to corruptors than establishing Allah's Hadd upon them. He should not exceed what is legislated, as the One who legislated it is more knowledgeable about the way of governing them. Every Muslim scholar who combines the virtue of knowledge and the righteousness of Muslims who combine the virtue of knowledge and righteousness of action, must call to good and deter from evil. If he is capable of nullifying the evil and repelling it and deterring the one demanding it when doing it... If he is not capable himself, but another is capable, then that is for the Sultan not anyone else. If he is not capable except of speech, he must order with the tongue. If he is not capable except of denial with the heart, he denies it. Enjoining good in this is like forbidding evil. If the reforming scholar has room to call to it and order it, he does so. If he is only capable of speech... Who Undertakes Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil:",

    "text": "Imam Al-Halimi said: The one enjoining good and forbidding evil should be discerning, gentle where gentleness is needed, harsh where harshness is needed, speaking to every class of people with what he knows because it is more suitable for them and more listened to among them. He should be unbiased and not compromising. He should reform himself first and rectify it, then turn to reforming and rectifying others. Allah Almighty said: (Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves?). From Muhammad bin Al-Nadr, he said: A man was mentioned in the presence of Al-Rabi' bin Khuthaym. He said: I am not pleased with myself so that I may be free from blaming it to blaming others. Indeed, people feared Allah regarding the sins of others and felt safe from Him regarding their own sins. The Sultan Who Commits Immoralities and the Function of Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil. Al-Halimi said: The Sultan who commits immoralities enjoins good and forbids evil; because authority is based on this. If he withdrew from it, he would not be a Sultan. No one below him is like him in this; because undertaking this matter is only abandoned by withholding the Sultan from it for his knowledge and righteousness. If he chose his own righteousness, he became deserving of change, so he would not be a changer of others with that. In Al-Bayhaqi from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, unless you enjoin good and forbid evil until there remains nothing of good but you ordered us with it, and nothing of evil but you forbade us from it, we will not enjoin anyone with good nor forbid anyone from evil. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to us: \"Enjoin good even if you do not do all of it, and forbid evil even if you do not desist from all of it.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said: Satan wants you to not achieve this trait, which is that you do not enjoin good until you do all of it, meaning this leads to cutting off the door of Hisbah (accountability). Who is immune from sins? From Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, that a man came to him and said: O Ibn Abbas, I want to enjoin good and forbid evil. He said: Have you reached that? He said: I hope so. He said: If you are not good at opening with three letters from the Book of Allah Almighty: (Do you order righteousness of the people) the verse. Have you mastered this verse? He said: No. He said: The second letter is His Almighty's saying: (Why do you say what you do not do) the verse. Have you mastered this verse? He said: No. He said: The third letter. He said: The saying of the righteous servant: (And I do not intend to differ from you in that which I have forbidden you) the verse. Have you mastered this verse? He said: No. He said: Then start with yourself! Explanation of Who Left Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil due to Corruption. From Al-Nu'man bin Bashir, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The likeness of the one abiding by Allah's limits and the one compromising in them is like a people who drew lots for a ship. Some of them got the lower part and some of them got the upper part. Those in the lower part used to fetch water passing by those in the upper part, so they passed by them and annoyed them. Those in the upper part said: You annoyed us by pouring water on us. So they took an axe and started making a hole in the ship. Those in the upper part said: What are you doing?! If they leave them and what they intend, they will all drown. And if they take their hands (stop them), they will all be saved.\" Narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih. Al-Bayhaqi narrated from Abu Umamah, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The best Jihad is a word of truth before an unjust Sultan.\" And for him from Abu Dharr, and in it: \"And he advised me to speak the truth even if it was bitter.\" From Hudhayfah, he said: \"Islam is eight shares: Islam is a share, prayer is a share, Zakah is a share, fasting Ramadan is a share, Hajj is a share, Jihad is a share, enjoining good is a share, and forbidding evil is a share. Whoever has no share has failed.\" From Jabir, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Allah revealed to Gabriel, peace be upon him, to overturn such and such city with its people. He said: He said: O Lord, indeed among them is Your servant so-and-so who did not disobey You for the blink of an eye. He said: Overturn it on him and on them, for his face never changed color (in anger) for Me for an hour.\" From Malik bin Fadalah, he said: We agreed on the love of the world, so none of us enjoins another, nor does any of us forbid another, and Allah Almighty will not leave this on this state. I wish I knew what punishment will descend! From Ibn Abbas regarding His Almighty's saying: (And if not for Allah checking the people some of them by means of others), he said: \"Checking by the one who prays for the one who does not pray, and by the one who performs Hajj for the one who does not perform Hajj, and by the one who pays Zakah for the one who does not pay Zakah.\" From Bilal bin Sa'd, he said: \"Indeed, sin if hidden harms only its doer, and if announced and not changed, harms the general public.\" He said: \"Indeed, it is from your negligence of yourself and your turning away from Allah Almighty that you see what angers Allah and you overlook it, neither enjoining nor forbidding regarding it, out of fear of what possesses neither harm nor benefit for you.\" He said: \"Whoever leaves enjoining good and forbidding evil out of fear of creatures, obedience is stripped from him. Even if he orders his child or some of his clients, they would not value his right.\"",

    "text": "Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, said in his sermon: O people, you read this verse and interpret it contrary to its interpretation (O you who have believed, upon you is yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided). I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: \"There are no people who commit sins, and among them is one who can denounce them but does not do so, except that Allah is about to encompass them with a punishment from Him.\" Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The people of a village containing eighteen thousand whose deeds were like the deeds of prophets were punished. They said: O Messenger of Allah, how is that? He said: They did not get angry for the sake of Allah Almighty, nor did they enjoin good nor forbid evil.\" Al-Ghazali, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Everyone who witnesses an evil and does not change it, nor denounce it, and remains silent about it, is a partner in it. The listener is a partner of the backbiter. This applies to all sins, even sitting with one who wears brocade, wears gold rings, sits on silk, sitting in a house or bath with images on its walls or vessels of gold or silver, sitting in a mosque where people pray badly not completing bowing and prostration, sitting in a preaching gathering where innovation is mentioned, or in a debate or argument gathering where harm and obscenity occur through foolishness and insults. In summary, whoever mixes with people, his sins increase even if he is pious in himself, unless he abandons compromise, is not seized by the blame of a blamer for the sake of Allah, and occupies himself with good deeds and preventing evil. The obligation only drops from him by one of two things: First: That he knows that if he denounces, he will not be paid attention to, the evil will not be abandoned, and he will be looked at with the eye of mockery. This is common in evils committed by jurists (Fuqaha) and those who claim to be people of religion. Here silence is permissible, but rebuking with the tongue is recommended to show the rites of religion for one who cannot do other than rebuking with the tongue. He must leave that place, for it is not permissible to witness sin by choice. Whoever sits in a gathering of drinking is a sinner even if he does not drink. Whoever sits with a backbiter, or wearer of silk, or eater of usury or haram is a sinner, so let him stand from his place. Second: That he knows he can prevent the evil, like seeing a bottle with wine and throwing it to break it, or snatching a musical instrument from its owner's hand and striking it on the ground, but he knows he will be beaten or suffer harm. Here Hisbah (accountability) is recommended due to the Almighty's saying: (And forbid what is wrong and be patient over what befalls you). It is not obligatory unless the harm that befalls him has many degrees requiring long consideration mentioned by Al-Ghazali in Ihya' in the Book of Enjoining Good. In summary, the obligation does not drop except by harm to his body by beating, or to his wealth by destruction, or to his status by disparaging him in a way that impugns his chivalry. As for fear of obscenity of the denier against him, fear of his exposure to him with the tongue, his enmity to him, or creating illusion of his striving in the future with what displeases him, and intervening between him and an increase of good he awaits; all these are illusions and weak matters by which obligation does not drop. Know that the pillar of Hisbah is two things: First: Kindness and gentleness, and starting with admonition by way of religion, not by way of violence, arrogance, and showing off with the sign of righteousness. For that confirms the motive for sin, and incites the sinners to denial and harm. Then if he harms him and he is not of good character, he gets angry for himself, and the denial for the sake of Allah Almighty is rejected, and he busies himself with healing his anger from him, so he becomes a sinner. Rather, he should be hating of the Hisbah, wishing the sinner would leave the sin by someone else's word. If he loves to be the objector, that is because of what is in his soul of the state of seeking accountability. From him, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"No one enjoins good nor forbids evil except one who is gentle in what he enjoins, gentle in what he forbids, forbearing in what he enjoins, forbearing in what he forbids, knowledgeable in what he enjoins, knowledgeable in what he forbids.\" A preacher admonished Al-Ma'mun violently, so he said: O man; be gentle, for He sent one better than you to one worse than me, and commanded him with gentleness, so He Almighty said: (And speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear). Abu Umamah narrated that a young man came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: Do you give me permission to commit adultery? The people shouted at him. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Bring him near, come close to me.\" So he came close to him. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Do you like it for your mother? He said: No - may Allah make me your ransom. He said: Likewise people do not like it for their mothers. Then he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Do you like it for your daughter? He said: No. He said: Likewise people do not like it for their daughters. Until he mentioned to him the sister, the paternal aunt, and the maternal aunt, saying: Likewise people do not like it. Then he placed his hand on his chest and said: O Allah, purify him, forgive his sin, and guard his chastity. After that, there was nothing",

The people of the Fire will gather around him and say: O So-and-so, what is the matter with you? What happened to you? Were you not enjoining us with good and forbidding us from evil! He will say: Yes, I used to enjoin you with good but not do it, and forbid you from evil but do it.\" Al-Bayhaqi brought out from Anas, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The believers are sincere to one another, loving each other even if their dwellings and bodies are far apart. And the wicked are cheating one another, abandoning one another even if their dwellings and bodies are close together.\" \"Notices\" First: The one enjoining good should be knowledgeable about the differences of scholars in what he enjoins and forbids. Second: If he is only capable with the heart, let him say at his denial: O Allah, this is an evil I do not approve of, three times. Let him pray for him at that time for repentance, and turn his face away from him in denial of his action, not in rebuke and revenge. Beware of that; for Sheikh Abu Al-Hasan, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Honor the believers even if they are immoral sinners. Enjoin them with good and forbid them from evil, and desert them out of mercy for them. Do not restrict/estimate against them.",

    "text": "He, may Allah be pleased with him, said: If the light of the disobedient believer were unveiled, it would fill what is between the heavens and the earth, so what is your thought about the light of the obedient believer? \"Notice\" And be safe, O fool, O ignorant, O wicked, O foolish one, from standing for yourself in the face of the one enjoining good and forbidding evil, and attacking him and getting angry, to harm yourself, or for a limb of yours to change. You would be a hypocrite by that, denying the command and prohibition; rather you would be a stubborn tyrant. For you measure yourself against him, so you deny his command, and you do not know that he is an agent for you in commanding and forbidding on behalf of Allah and His Messenger. Rather, you should recognize his right in reverence, dignity, submission, humbleness before him, and accepting his command with hearing and obedience. Rather, hasten to sincere repentance, returning to Allah, and regret. Whenever you do contrary to that, hatred will befall you and you will not find for yourself a protector or a helper. Know that Allah is the protector of the one standing for the truth, commanding [good], forbidding falsehood, and his supporter due to His saying: (O you who have believed, if you support Allah, He will support you). So you must recognize his right at the time of the command, and rectify your excess in the hour he commands you, for fear that Satan shows you anger against the one commanding you. Know the value of his status, for he has the sanctity of standing for Allah and His Messenger, and the sanctity of jealousy for Allah, and anger for Him. These are sanctities understood only by one whom Allah wants good for, and return to Him. Do you not see the one standing at the door of the Sultan or the door of the governor of your city, commanding you with something not related to religion, but a worldly matter, either to take your money, or harm you in your child or dependents; are you able to oppose him, or able to deny his command and prohibition?! So how about one who speaks on the tongue of the Greatest Messenger, and about the command of the King of Kings?! How can he be opposed? That is only due to the greatness of your heedlessness of Allah and the greatness of your calamity! Look at the sanctity of a creature, and your speed in answering him with hearing and obedience, and look at your opposition to the one speaking for the King of Kings, your attack on him, and your denial of his command and prohibition. So beware of the density of your self and the heedlessness of your heart. Know the rights of those who stand for Allah and His Messenger. Were it not for that, calamity would have befallen creation; i.e., were it not for the one standing for Allah, commanding, forbidding, advising creation, admonishing them, and counseling each other, what only Allah knows would have befallen them. So we ask Allah for pardon and well-being, and that He grants us success for His obedience, and keeps us away from His disobedience. He is the Guardian of success. May Allah bless our master Muhammad, his family, and his companions and grant peace. Chapter: On What Should be in the Gathering of Preaching. The gathering of preaching should not be devoid of deterrence from sins. Sheikh Abu Al-Faraj Ibn Al-Jawzi said: And what contains deterrence from sins. I contemplated this regarding myself, and I saw many of my gatherings passing between interpreting a verse, mentioning a report and stories of the righteous, and the horrors of the Resurrection. All that is good, except that due to the soundness of my heart, I did not believe there were many sins and immoralities among Muslims! I hardly mentioned the prohibition of adultery and the like. So I thought and saw the priority is that the bulk of the gathering be on this, for most of them are commoners, and these ills are widespread among them. So what does the standing of \"Sari\" all night benefit them, and the hunger of \"Bishr Al-Hafi\", and the asceticism of \"Malik bin Dinar\"? Even if mentioning that contains a type of rebuke for the negligent. But the most important is that he should follow a path where the generality of the gathering is on frightening about the consequences of sins and strictness in forbidding them. No gathering is free of a wine drinker, a dealer in usury, and one eager for adultery. Then we mention a condition of it also in observing the obligations of the pillars of prayer, Zakat, and others. Then point in the end to the states of the righteous; for every people has a drink. If this is established, he must avoid leadership, and be good to his wife and children in expanding provision, for expanding provision increases life span, and connects the womb (kinship). For the womb (Rahim) clings to the Throne and says: \"I am the Rahim, whoever connects me, Allah connects him, and whoever cuts me, Allah cuts him.\" In a narration: A branch from the Rahman. Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said: \"I will surely connect whoever connects you and cut whoever cuts you.\" So you must change what you deny, and deny what necessitates denial.

    "text": "Know that the scholar's way in changing evil is to speak about it from what Allah taught him by way of admonition in his gatherings or away from gatherings, mentioning the ruling. If he is listened to and returns, the goal is achieved, his word engaged his heart, he established his excuse with Allah, and performed what was obligatory upon him. He is also safe from the great calamity upon him in not speaking; for it is reported \"that on the Day of Resurrection a man will cling to another man who does not know him and say: What is the matter with you? I never saw you. He will say to him: Yes, you saw me one day on an evil and did not forbid me from it.\" This is a dangerous matter before safety from it occurs. By speaking, he escapes this danger. He only leaves it while seeing it due to the souls' familiarity with it, and that destroyed those who passed of nations. It is reported \"that Moses, peace be upon him, passed by a village that Allah Almighty had destroyed. He said: O Lord, how did You destroy them when I knew a righteous man among them? Allah Almighty revealed to him, O Moses: 'He did not have Ghayrah (jealousy/anger) for Me.'\" This report benefitted us that if he had changed upon them, he would not have perished, nor would they. The ruling in that is he is rewarded for changing upon them and denying, just as you are commanded to leave what they innovated. When they fell into opposition and he remained silent, it was a falling from him into what they are in, because he committed what was forbidden of silence upon seeing opposition. So he became equal with them in committing the forbidden. There was no one in the village then to lift the affliction from them when it descended upon them, because punishment is only lifted by compliance, and there was no compliant one then, so what happened happened. Here it is today, no doubt and no hiding in the occurrence of this matter due to the occurrence of what occurs and the silence of our scholars in the gathering; they do not speak upon seeing it nor urge in their gatherings of knowledge to leave it. So undoubtedly, the descent of all causes of punishment is continuous in my view mostly, except for whom Allah protected. Chapter: On Matters People take Lightly and from which Calamity Comes. Some people take lightly matters: Boys Entering Houses: Among them is that a boy enters the houses of some of them to fulfill their needs, and eats and drinks with them, among his women and daughters, until his beard grows, and he is in that state. Someone with knowledge says to him: The entry of this adult youth upon you has become forbidden! The man and woman say: This one was raised with us and among our children, he is like one of them, and we know nothing but good of him. They did not deny this great calamity! Entry of Neighborhood Sons and Neighbors' Sons! Likewise, if there is a youth entering upon them and he says: He is the son of our neighborhood, and the son of our neighbors, and they did not deny that. Most corruption happens from this calamity. The Jurist Teacher Sending Some Boys to His House: Likewise, the jurist teacher sends some of his boys to his house to fulfill his need; he enters upon his wife and daughters and continues on that until he reaches puberty and he did not prevent him. Sending Adults to Houses! Among them: Whoever sends an adult due to his lack of knowledge, and this is great ignorance. Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we shall return. Consequences of Non-Compliance: Know that non-compliance leads to corruption by the entry of foreigners (non-Mahram) upon foreigners. Sometimes this is by the man's choice, and sometimes by his wife's choice. Bringing the Brother to the Wife! Among people is one who brings his brother to his wife and says: He is my brother so do not be shy of him. One Who Manages His Craft in His House! Among people is one who has a craft like a weaver, tailor, and the like, working his craft in his house. His workers and boys work with him, so his wife enters upon them in his presence, talks to the workers, addresses them, chats with them and they chat with her. They do not deny the prohibition in looking nor in speech. Perhaps the master is absent for his need in the market, and orders his wife to do for the worker what he needs of \"spinning\" yarn, or what he needs, and they do not deny that! That became a habit, and intimacy and love occur between foreigners by this malicious habit. Talk and joking are repeated between them until modesty goes from them. This is from lack of chivalry. Bringing in Servants, Farmers, and Tillers: Among them is one who brings into his house people from his servants, entourage, farmers, tillers, sowers, fodder carriers, and hoers from freemen and slaves upon his family, daughters, folk, and neighbors, while they are foreigners to them, to take out the fodder tool and feed and the like of what they need. They look at his folk and family and they do not cover from them. Perhaps some talk to others and that became a habit among them. They do not see that as forbidden, nor do they deny it. Few refrain from their entry except one with jealousy for his family, or who has fear of Allah Almighty. We ask Allah for well-being.

    "text": "First Question: What is the saying of the masters, the scholars, the Imams of religion and scholars of Muslims regarding a group of Muslims who permitted looking at the face of a beautiful beardless boy, buying him for a large sum, giving his price to their Sheikhs, and being alone with him with a foreign man? Some of them hide him under his cloak, and some hide him with him in his garment. The foreign man \"Yasharshihuhu\" (dandles/plays with him), which is placing the chest of the beautiful beardless boy on his chest and shaking him so his heart flutters as the pigeon bird flutters. If they invite a stranger, they order him to wash his hands before putting them in the vessel. If he wipes them on the clothes of his body, they all flee from him. If a morsel falls from him, they say to him: It became impure. They do not pray behind a stranger Imam even if he was the Imam of Mecca and Medina - upon its dweller best prayer and peace - or Jerusalem. They do not greet him nor follow his actions. They say to a man: If a man insults Imam Abu Bakr and Umar, may Allah be pleased with them, and repents, is his repentance accepted? If he says: Yes, it is accepted, they kill him. If a stranger dies among them, they do not attend his funeral. They do not marry anyone from other than their kind. When a man marries a stranger man [to his daughter], their Sheikhs say to him: Do you marry [to] so-and-so?! So they isolate him and prevent his children from him until the Sheikhs are pleased with him. Is the term 'Innovator' (Bid'i) applied to these people? Must they be shunned? Is looking at their faces not permissible? Is dealing with them not lawful? What is obligatory upon them legally? And what is the ruling of Allah Almighty according to you in that? Give us a Fatwa, rewarded, may Allah reward you! The Answer: Deeming lawful what was mentioned above is Kufr (disbelief). If they repent, [good], otherwise they are killed. A man wiping his hand on his garment is not forbidden. A falling morsel does not become impure; rather eating it is recommended. The repentance of youths is accepted. Killing them for saying it is accepted is forbidden; if they deem that lawful, they are killed. These are people of innovation and misguidance. The ruler must support Allah Almighty, support the people of religion, and help in undertaking the interests of Muslims by uncovering these misguided innovators and their likes. If they repent, [good], otherwise he kills them by the legal way, this being the case. And Allah knows best the truth. Fatwa given by the Allama Sheikh Shams al-Din bin al-Imam, may Allah Almighty keep him in goodness and safety. He gave the fatwa and wrote it with his hand. Another Answer to the Previous Questions: The Imam, the Allama, Abu Abdullah Shams al-Din Muhammad bin al-Imam al-Shadhili said, then Sheikh Shihab al-Din Ahmad bin Nasr al-Baghdadi said about this question with another answer: As for their mentioned action regarding the beardless boy, it is the ugliest of ugliness and the most obscene of obscenities. They must be fought for that with what binds them of Hadd punishments and Ta'zir befitting them legally, deterring them customarily and naturally. As for their not praying behind others, it contradicts them based on what they are upon of their lowly innovation and heinous misguidance: That whoever opposes them, prayer behind him is not valid. Disagreement occurred among the Salaf - may Allah be pleased with them - in many branches, and none of them refrained from praying behind one who opposed him in his belief, for the word of Islam encompasses them. Their belief in the impurity of the morsel is part of their ignorance and misguidance. Likewise, their belief in the non-acceptance of the repentance of the insulter of one of the two Sheikhs - may Allah be pleased with them - is contrary to what the majority of Muslims are upon regarding the right of Allah Almighty. As for the right of the oppressed, even if it is said it does not drop by repentance, it belongs to the rulings of the Hereafter. Rather, it is permissible to interact with the one repenting from wrongs against creation after his truthfulness in repentance, due to his inability to satisfy an adversary. For Allah Almighty commanded giving respite to the insolvent for his insolvency. Likewise, everyone who owes a right he is unable to perform is excused. It is not a flaw in him if truthfulness in his repentance and sincerity of his intention is known from him. Rarely do we count this sect in evidence due to their excessive ignorance and Satan's hold on their forelocks. The ruler - may Allah grant him success - must rebuke them from this innovation and deter them from it with what befits them legally, deterring them customarily and naturally. Allah knows best the truth. A Question about the Beardless Boy Also! What is the saying of the masters, the scholars, Imams of religion and scholars of Muslims regarding a group of Muslims who permitted looking at the face of a beautiful beardless boy, seclusion with him, hugging him, and buying the boy for a price to take him as a friend (Khidn), calling him \"Sharshuh\" or \"Bidayah\"? Among them is a sect that did not pray behind an Imam unless they knew his father and grandfather. They say to a man: What do you say about the insulter of Abu Bakr and Umar, may Allah be pleased with them, if he repents; is his repentance accepted or not?! If he says: His repentance is accepted, they kill him. Is the term 'Innovation' applied to these? Must they be shunned and not dealt with? Is looking at their faces permissible? What is obligatory upon them legally? What is Allah's ruling on them? Give us a Fatwa, rewarded, may Allah reward you. The Fatwa:",

    "text": "Our master and Sheikh Sa'd al-Din al-Dayri al-Hanafi, may Allah prolong his life, answered saying: Praise be to the Guide to the Truth. The question about these ignorant misguided ones has been repeated. The detailed answer about their rulings and the summary of their ruling has been obtained: That deeming lawful the association with the \"beardless boy\" in the mentioned manner is Kufr (disbelief), especially if he believes it is an act of worship to draw closer. His leaving the following of Muslim Imams is an innovation and opposition to the transmitted Sunnah. As for their denial of the validity of the youth's repentance, in that is a rejection of the indication of the Clear Book; for its generality implies the permissibility of repentance from every sin with its legal condition. No sin is greater than denying the Lord, Glory be to Him and Exalted, and the repentant from it, acknowledging the reality of His Lordship, it is accepted from him and his punishment drops. Allah Almighty knows best. Then Sheikh Shihab al-Din al-Sarkhasi al-Shafi'i, may Allah keep him, informed us agreeing with this answer and said at its end: My answer is the answer of Sheikh Sa'd al-Din al-Dayri, may Allah be pleased with him. A Third Question: Regarding a group following people known as \"Mutawwa'ah\" who see companionship of boys, looking at them, and seclusion with them [as permissible], and see dancing in mosques and clapping. People from Ahl al-Sunnah came to them and said to them: This is forbidden, you are committing innovations not on the path of truth. A group of them returned and repented to Allah. Then when the people [Ahl al-Sunnah] left them, those who repented forbade them from following Ahl al-Sunnah, and they compelled them, forced them, and made them swear not to follow Ahl al-Sunnah. What is the ruling of these Sheikhs? And those who followed them and those who made them swear? Our Master the Imam, the Flag, Shams al-Din bin Hamid, may Allah pardon him, answered: These people called \"Mutawwa'ah\", it is forbidden to follow them in what they rely on of great corruptions of associating with beardless boys and seclusion with them, because looking at a beardless boy with desire, according to what scholars corrected, and mixing with them and associating with them in seclusion is the greatest danger. As for clapping with the palm, as resemblance to women, it is also forbidden. Likewise dancing in mosques. It is not lawful to associate with them nor follow them in these reprehensible acts. The ruler - may Allah Almighty support him - must ask them to repent from the evil, and disperse their gathering from this malicious meeting, and he will be rewarded for that. As for one who repents from that, it is not permissible for him after repentance to mix with them nor agree with them. Whoever is forced to return to them, and they made him swear under duress, and he is able to escape them with one of strength among them, it is not malicious to me [text unclear/corrupt: 'lam yakhbuth li'? possibly 'lam yahnath li' - he does not break oath? context implies ruling on oath/duress]. As for if he believed the permissibility of sins in mosques and its lawfulness therein is forbidden for them, they disbelieve by that and are asked to repent. If they do not repent, they are killed; because whoever deems lawful what Allah Almighty forbade has disbelieved. End. Sheikh Imam, the Scholar, Ala' al-Din al-Qutni, may Allah pardon him, also answered this question saying: These are a people who went astray and exited the path of truth and the school of Ahl al-Sunnah. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"My nation will split into seventy-three sects, one of which is saved and the rest in the Fire.\" These are from the sects that are in the Fire; for the Saved Sect is what he and his companions, peace and blessings be upon him, were upon. Imam Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said: What appeared of this religion is truth, and what was hidden of it is falsehood, due to His saying: (To make it prevail over all religion). These people, if they believe that seclusion with youths and looking at them is permissible, they have disbelieved. The rulers - may Allah support them - must kill them and cleanse the earth of them if they do not repent. If they believe it is forbidden, they have committed debauchery (Fisq) and their probity drops. The rulers - may Allah Almighty support them - must punish them with severe discretionary punishment (Ta'zir), and rebuke and deter them from that. If they do not return from this, fight them. As for the one they made swear not to associate with Ahl al-Sunnah, no expiation (Kaffarah) is obligatory upon him for associating with Ahl al-Sunnah, for he is forced on the oath. End. Then he answered with another answer saying: There is no doubt that Ahl al-Sunnah are the elite of this nation. Whoever follows them and imitates them has walked the path of truth and the way of the successful. Whoever strays from their path has strayed from guidance and walked the path of the perished. These are a people who committed innovations, prohibitions, and reprehensible matters. No one of the Imams of the Salaf permitted the permissibility of what they do. If they persist in that, they are major destructive sins. If they believe it is permissible; it may lead to Kufr; because it is from the rules that whoever believes the permissibility of a prohibition has disbelieved. They must repent from that, return to the truth, and follow guidance. If they do not, the rulers - may Allah Almighty support them - must punish them with severe Ta'zir, rebuke them from that, and return them to the path of truth. As for one forced to swear, there is no expiation on him if he returns and follows Ahl al-Sunnah. Chapter: Is There a Cure for This Disease?",

    "text": "Ibn al-Qayyim said: If it is said: Is there with all that a cure for this incurable disease, i.e., what was mentioned earlier of sins! And a Ruqyah (incantation) for this deadly magic? What is the trick to repel this insanity? Is there a purposeful path to repentance? Can the one drunk with the wine of passion wake up? Can the lover possess his heart when love has reached its core? So whoever's heart and limbs are attached to the aforementioned sins, it is said: Yes, Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted has not sent down a disease but He sent down a cure for it, known by who knows it and ignored by who ignores it. Speech on the cure of this disease is from two ways: First: Cutting off its material before its arrival. Second: Uprooting it before its descent. Both are easy for whom Allah makes easy, and impossible for whom Allah does not help; for the reins of matters are in His hands. Lowering the Gaze and Its Benefits: As for the way preventing the occurrence of this disease, it is two things: First: Lowering the gaze as mentioned before, for the look is a poisoned arrow from the arrows of Iblis. In lowering the gaze are several benefits: First: It is compliance with the commands of his Lord, Blessed and Exalted. The happy one in this world is only happy by complying with His commands, and the wretched one in this world and the Hereafter is only wretched by wasting His commands. Second: It prevents the arrival of the poisoned arrow, which, were it to reach him, would be his destruction and the hardening of his heart. Third: It bequeaths the heart intimacy with Allah Almighty, and its gathering upon Allah. For unleashing the gaze scatters the heart and disperses it, and distances it from Allah Almighty. There is nothing more harmful to the heart than unleashing the gaze, for it causes alienation between the servant and his Lord, Blessed and Exalted. Fourth: It strengthens the heart and gladdens it, just as unleashing the gaze weakens and saddens it. Fifth: It earns the heart light just as unleashing it earns it darkness. Therefore, Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted mentioned a verse in Surah An-Nur following the command to lower the gaze, saying: (Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts). Sixth: It bequeaths true physiognomy (Firasah) by which one distinguishes between truth and falsehood, and the truthful and the liar. Shah al-Kirmani used to say: Whoever builds his outer self with following the Sunnah, and his inner self with constant observation (Muraqaba), lowers his gaze from prohibitions, restrains himself from desires, and feeds on the lawful, his physiognomy will not err. Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted rewards the servant for his deed with what is of the same genus as his deed. Whoever leaves something for Allah, Allah Almighty compensates him with better than it. So if he lowers his gaze for Allah from Allah's prohibitions, Allah Almighty compensates him by unleashing the light of his insight in exchange for confining his gaze for Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted, and opens for him the door of knowledge, faith, gnosis, and true illuminating physiognomy which is only attained by the insight of the heart. The opposite of this is what Allah described the people of Lot with, of blindness ('Amah) which is the opposite of insight (Basirah), saying: (Indeed, they are in their intoxication, wandering blindly). He described them with intoxication which is corruption of the mind, and blindness ('Amah) which is corruption of insight. So attachment to images causes corruption of the mind, blindness of insight, and intoxicates the heart. Seventh: It bequeaths the heart firmness, courage, and strength. So Allah Almighty gathers for him between the authority of insight and argument, and the authority of power and strength. Eighth: It spoils Satan's entry into the heart, for he enters with the look, and penetrates with it to the heart faster than the penetration of air in an empty space. Ninth: It empties the heart for thinking about its interests and engaging in them. Unleashing the gaze scatters that for him and intervenes between it and that, so his affairs fall apart, and he falls into following his desire and heedlessness of the remembrance of his Lord, Blessed and Exalted. Allah Almighty said: (And do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect). Unleashing the gaze causes these three things alone. Tenth: That between the eye and the heart is a passage or path that necessitates the transition of one by what occupies the other, and that it be rectified by its rectitude and corrupted by its corruption. If the look is corrupted, the heart is corrupted for it likewise. Regarding rectitude, if the eye is ruined and corrupted, the heart is ruined and corrupted, and becomes like a dump which is the place of impurities, filth, and dirt. It is not fit for the habitation of knowing Allah Almighty, loving Him, turning to Him, intimacy with Him, and joy in nearness to Him. Only opposites of that inhabit it. This is a pointer to some benefits of lowering the gaze that informs you of what is behind them. The Second Matter of the Cure: Occupying the heart with what repels it from that, and prevents falling into it: It is either a disturbing fear, or an unsettling love. Whenever the heart is devoid of fear of something whose loss is more harmful to it than obtaining this beloved, it finds no escape from loving images. Explanation of this: The self does not leave a beloved except for a higher beloved, or fear of a disliked thing whose occurrence is more harmful to it than losing this beloved. This requires two things from its owner; if one is missing, he does not benefit himself:",

    "text": "First: A correct insight by which he distinguishes between the degrees of the beloved and the disliked, so he prefers the higher of the two beloveds over the lower, and endures the lower of the two disliked things to be saved from the higher. This is specific to the intellect, and he is not considered sane who is contrary to that; rather animals might be in a better state than him. Second: Strength of resolve, patience, and empowerment in which he can perform this action and abandonment. Often a man knows the extent of difference, but the weakness of his self, determination, and resolve refuse him, so that he does not fall [short] except due to his baseness, greed, lowliness of self, and baseness of ambition. Such a person does not benefit himself nor does anyone else benefit from him. \"Notices\" First: The verses, hadiths, and chapters repeated in this book are for added benefit or returning profit. Second: This book is established by way of admonition and warning, so there is no objection if the speech moves from one school of thought (Madhhab) to another school, because speech in admonition does not depend on the speaker's school. Our Sheikh was asked about some of his gatherings where he gathers speech from his school and the school of others. He said: If the speaker is speaking in admonition, he should not restrict himself to one school. If he is in a Fiqh lesson, he should not exit his school except for necessity. Conclusion on Explanation of Repentance and its Conditions, and Seeking Forgiveness and its Virtue: O Allah, we ask You for a good end with a righteous conclusion by Your grace and generosity. Chapter: On Repentance. Allah Almighty said: (And turn to Allah in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed). So He made repentance obligatory and encouraged it. He said: (Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant). My master Abu Al-Hajjaj Al-Uqsuri said: The reality of repentance is going to the King, the Bestower. The evidence for it is His Almighty's saying: (Indeed, I am going to my Lord; He will guide me). Repentance is of two types: Repentance from Allah Almighty upon the servant, and repentance from the servant to Allah Almighty. Repentance from Allah Almighty upon the servant is that He makes obedience beloved to him and disobedience hateful to him, and grants him success to act according to what He made beloved to him. His Almighty's saying: (But Allah has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance and disobedience). This is the repentance from Him Almighty upon the servant. From this repentance arises the servant's repentance. The Almighty said: (Then He turned to them so they could repent), i.e., He turned to them so that they would repent, because unless Allah Almighty turns to the servant, repentance does not come from him. For this meaning it was said: \"Care comes before guardianship (Wilayah), and consequents are built on antecedents.\" The witness for that from the Great Quran is His Almighty's saying: (Deluded away from the Qur'an is he who is deluded). i.e., He turns away from faith in the Quran, listening to it, and understanding it, who was turned away from it in eternity (pre-existence) and upon whom misery and deprivation were decreed, and the Pen ran. We ask the Generous for [a good] conclusion. The repentance of the repentant is known in four things: First: He restrains his tongue from superfluity and backbiting. Second: No envy or enmity is seen in his heart. Third: He leaves evil brothers, for they are the ones who carry him to reject this intent, and confuse the validity of this resolve for him. Fourth: He is prepared for death, regretful, seeking forgiveness for his past sins, striving. Explanation of the Meaning of Sincere Repentance (Tawbah Nasuh): Our Sheikh said: The Sheikhs said: It reached us from Ubayy bin Ka'b, may Allah be pleased with him, said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, what is sincere repentance? He said: \"Regret for the sin, then you never return to it.\" Maimun bin Mahran, may Allah be pleased with him, said: From Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both: How many a repentant comes to the Resurrection thought to be repentant, but is not repentant, because he did not perfect the doors of repentance. Abdullah bin Shumayl, may Allah be pleased with him, said: As long as the servant's heart persists on one sin, his deed is suspended in the air. If he repents from that sin, [good], otherwise his deed remains suspended. Scholars, may Allah be pleased with them, said: If a servant repents from a sin but not another, repentance from the sin he repented from is valid, and the sins he did not repent from remain upon him, he is punished for them, until he repents from all.

    "text": "Our Sheikh said: Know that the stations of repentance are ten: Regret for the sin by quitting it, abandoning returning to it with much seeking of forgiveness, exiting all ignorance by learning what is necessary of obligations, moving from minor to major sin [avoidance? text might mean moving away from minor to avoid major], returning injustices; what he cannot return he resolves to return, and if he finds something to return in place of the injustice, believing in self-loathing. Al-Fudayl bin Iyad, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Whoever loathes himself for Allah, Allah secures him from His loathing. Among them is leaving desires and decrease [in worldly things?], abandoning your evil companion brothers, rectifying your food and clothing, increasing weeping and pleading to Allah Almighty for pardon for what has passed, and leaving actions whose practice brings sins to a person, otherwise his repentance is not valid. Every repentance for which a sign is not seen on the limbs, how fast is its return!! The sign is decrease in the body, lack of greed, and much weeping. This is validated by His Almighty's saying: (Except those who repented and corrected themselves and made evident - so those I will accept their repentance, and I am the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful). Thus the repentant needs the effects of his repentance to be evident. Explanation of the Reality of Repentance: Sign of Repentance: Know that the reality of repentance in the heart is that the repentant hates the sin as he used to love it, weeps from it if he remembers it, and leaves it as he used to take it. Sign of Abandonment (Khidhlan): Everything has a sign. The sign of abandonment is leaving weeping over the sin. The sign of the repentant in his repentance is seeking forgiveness from Allah and intensity of grief (Kamad). Meaning of Kamad: Necessary fear. People regarding repentance are in five directions: A man procrastinating, and a woman procrastinating repentance, deceived by long hope. This is the one deserving punishment from Allah Almighty. A man repented with his heart but his self calls him to what Allah Almighty dislikes; this one needs discipline for it by fasting, and cutting off desires until he weakens it from what Allah Almighty dislikes. If it weakens, he becomes strong to oppose it; this is his benefit, so Allah Almighty gives him according to his truthfulness in struggling against his self. A repentant man addicted to accountability has stood over himself in the position of an adversary fearing for its first nature, lest it falls from the eye of Allah Almighty, and his enemy Iblis and the brethren of devils triumph over him; this is the one deserving of Allah Almighty's guardianship (Wilayah). Know that the greatest of stations after repentance is Prayer with its conditions, obligations, and Sunnahs; for it is established from him, peace and blessings be upon him: \"The first thing a man is held accountable for is his prayer, then after that his women and what his right hand possesses. If he treated them well and taught them worship, Allah treats him well.\" Explanation of the Meaning of Repentance:",

    "text": "The Imam Sheikh, my master Abd al-Aziz al-Dirini, Allah's mercy be upon him, said: The meaning of Tawbah (Repentance): Return. It is said 'Taba', 'Anaba', and 'Aba' meaning: Returned. Repentance is returning from blameworthy descriptions to praiseworthy descriptions. It is said for one who returned from oppositions out of fear of Allah's punishment \"Anaba\", so he is Munib. And whoever returned out of glorification of Allah's Majesty \"Aba\", so he is Awwab. It is said: The beginning of repentance is an awakening from Allah Almighty falling into the heart, so the servant remembers his negligence and offense, despite the continuity of Allah Almighty's blessings upon him. So he knows that sins are killing poisons, fearing from them the occurrence of the disliked and the loss of the beloved in this world and the Hereafter. If this knowledge occurs to him, it bears fruit as a state (Hal), which is regret for wasting Allah Almighty's right. Then regret bears fruit as action, which is rushing to good deeds, performing obligations, returning injustices, and resolving to correct what is coming. If these three are organized, it is Repentance. The meaning of the Prophet's saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Regret is repentance\" means its greatest pillar is regret; for it does not occur until preceded by the first pillar which is knowledge of the harm of sin. It is said: Repentance is protecting modesty, and constant weeping. It is said: Repentance is regret for what passed and correction of what is coming. It is said: Repentance is that the servant knows his audacity against Allah and sees Allah's forbearance with him, not permitting the earth to swallow him or the fire to burn him for the sins he committed, then he repents from the sin and resolves not to return to it as milk does not return to the udder. It is said: Repentance is taking off the garment of harshness and spreading the carpet of loyalty. Sahl bin Abdullah said: Repentance is replacing blameworthy movements with praiseworthy movements, and that is not completed except by solitude, silence, and eating lawful things. Meaning: Isolation from evil associates. In the Hadith: \"The one who repents from sin is like one who has no sin.\" My master Abu Madyan, may Allah have mercy on him, said: The disturbance of the heart due to the shock of awakening is weightier than the deeds of the two heavy ones (Jinn and Mankind). Sahl said: Repentance is leaving procrastination. Sari al-Saqati said: Repentance is not forgetting your sin. Al-Bushanji said: If you remember your sin and find no sweetness for it, that is repentance. Dhu al-Nun said: The reality of repentance is that the earth narrows upon you despite its vastness until you have no escape, and your soul narrows upon you as Allah Almighty said: (Until when the earth was straitened for them despite its vastness, and their own souls were straitened for them) the verse. It was said to Abu Hafs: Why does the repentant hate the world? He said: Because it is an abode in which he disobeyed Allah. Some said: Repentance is a man sensing the term (death). Know that the sin after repentance is [worse than] seventy before it. Yahya bin Mu'adh said: A slip after repentance is uglier than seventy before it. Repentance is not upright except by constant struggle and continuous sorrows. Explanation of Conditions of Repentance: Know that conditions of repentance are four: Exiting the circle of opposition, accompanying regret, returning what concerns [rights] in the liability, and resolving not to return to the homeland of opposition. He said: The beginning of repentance is the servant waking up from the slumber of heedlessness by success from Allah, so he sees what bad negligence and shortcoming he is in despite the continuity of Allah Almighty's blessings. If he listens with his heart to the deterrents occurring to his mind, he resolves to repent. If Allah grants him success for the resolve, he quits and repents. The least obligatory upon the repentant is abandoning his brothers whom he used to accompany in disobedience. Some scholars said: One should abandon the places where he used to disobey Allah, and this is called: Hijrah (Migration). He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The Muhajir (Migrant) is he who abandons evil.\" He also said: \"The Muhajir is he who abandons what Allah forbade.\" Then by persisting in sitting with the righteous, and sitting in gatherings of Dhikr, his fear strengthens, his remembrance continues, the knot of persistence dissolves from his heart, he stops engaging in prohibitions, and restrains himself from following desires. So he leaves the slip immediately, regrets what passed of ugly deeds, and resolves not to return to the like of it in the future. If he continues on that, he is the one granted success in purpose. If he returns to a sin, he must renew repentance. One should not cut off hope; for every term has a decree. Allah is the Helper to reveal the veil and act by the Sunnah and the Book. Indeed, He is Generous, Accepter of Repentance. Seeking Forgiveness (Istighfar).",

    "text": "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Increase in seeking forgiveness, for seeking forgiveness eats up sins just as fire eats up wood and just as the sheep eats up green plants. If a person's scroll ascends to the sky and does not contain seeking forgiveness, it has no light. If it rises and contains seeking forgiveness, it has a shimmering light. If seeking forgiveness is not in it, it is dark (Yasir - possibly 'gloomy' or 'little' context suggests negative). Any people who sit in a gathering of idle talk then seal it with seeking forgiveness, their gathering is written for them as all seeking forgiveness.\" The Mighty and Majestic said: \"Is the son of Adam unable to seek forgiveness from Me a hundred times every day so I forgive him a thousand sins every day?\" Therefore, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed, my heart becomes clouded, and I seek forgiveness from Allah a hundred times a day.\" From Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, in the Farewell Pilgrimage saying: \"Indeed Allah Almighty has gifted you your sins upon seeking forgiveness. So whoever seeks forgiveness with a sincere intention, He forgives him. Whoever says 'La ilaha illa Allah', his scale tips. Whoever prays upon me, I will be his intercessor on the Day of Resurrection.\" Allah Almighty said in His Great Book: (Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver). And Almighty said: (And ask forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful). Some worshippers said: My sins were presented to me in the day (dream/vision?); what I sought forgiveness from Allah for was erased, and what I did not seek forgiveness for remained. It was said: Iblis - may Allah Almighty curse him - says: I adorned sins greatly - i.e., for this nation - but they broke my back with seeking forgiveness. No trial descends upon them from which they seek forgiveness from Allah but it disperses their desires. From Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him: \"That Iblis said to his Lord: By Your Might and Majesty, I will not cease misleading the sons of Adam as long as spirits are in them. His Lord said to him: By My Might and Majesty, I will not cease forgiving them as long as they seek My forgiveness.\" Narrated by Imam Ahmad. Ended with the praise of Allah, His aid, and His good success. Allah is the Granter of success to what is right. To Him belong favor and grace. Prayer and peace be upon the most noble of creation, our master Muhammad, his family, and all his companions. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. The completion of copying this blessed copy coincided with the blessed Thursday, the thirteenth of the month of Jumada al-Ula, year 1167 AH. Upon its owner be the best prayer and peace. Amen. At the hand of the poor one, confessing sin and shortcoming, Muhammad bin Hamid bin Hijazi bin Muhammad Al-Hatim by title, Al-Mashtuli, Shafi'i by school, Ahmadi by path. May Allah forgive him, his parents, whoever prayed for forgiveness for him, and the Muslim men and women, believing men and believing women, the living among them and the dead. Indeed You are Hearing, Near, Responder to supplications. The Book is finished. The blessings of joy are complete for its owner.",
