He was a researcher in history and news of countries in the second Abbasid era. It has been said of him that he can be considered a geographical teacher for Muslims, and it is said that many geographers following his era, such as Ibn Rustah, Ibn al-Faqih, al-Masudi, al-Istakhri, Ibn Hawqal, al-Maqdisi, and others considered him their teacher. His grandfather Wadih was one of the Mawali (clients) of al-Mansur al-Dawaniqi, the Abbasid Caliph, and Salih ibn Mansur; hence his family was famously known as al-Abbasi. His grandfather and father were government officials, but it is not known whether he had a government position or not, although this can be assumed from his frequent travels. Al-Ya'qubi was born in Baghdad and lived there, then emigrated to the land of Persia (Fars) and prolonged his stay in the land of Armenia, being there in the year 260 AH. He also entered India and the Arab countries, then the Levant (Al-Sham), then the Maghreb to Al-Andalus. In Egypt and the Maghreb, he enjoyed the attention of the Tulunid state. His date of birth is unknown, but his death appears to have been in the year 284 AH.\n\nHis Works:\nHe has several compositions, including: A book on the conquests and achievements of Tahir ibn al-Hasan, Geography of the Byzantine Empire, History of the Conquests of Africa, News of Past Nations, The Roads and Kingdoms (Al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik), Kings of the Romans, The Conformity of People to Their Time, History of Al-Ya'qubi, and Al-Buldan (The Countries).",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nAmong the most enjoyable books to read and benefit from are those that recount the history of countries, cities and their origins, reasons for their naming, and the customs and traditions of their people, especially since many of them still exist to our present day. The book \"Al-Buldan\" (The Countries) by the historian and traveler Ahmad ibn Abi Ya'qub, famous as Al-Ya'qubi, is very rich in its broad horizons and historical outlook on the reasons for the emergence and naming of countries, cities, nations, and their history. It is worth mentioning that Al-Ya'qubi in this book mentions his observations in those countries and cities, and also mentions his questioning of their inhabitants about certain matters therein. Then he presents his opinion on what he heard from them, whether it was logical and convincing or mere myth circulated by the people of that region. In the course of his speech, he comments on that, pointing out the distance of the narration of the people of that time from logic and reason. He mentioned who conquered the lands among the Caliphs and Emirs and the amount of their land tax (Kharaj), leaving no small or large detail he came across without counting it in the book. Thus, his compilation \"Kitab Al-Buldan\" became the oldest geographical source, and the most trustworthy due to the effort, trouble, care, and good performance he endured in its composition. However, whatever the case may be, \"Kitab Al-Buldan\" came as an enjoyable historical and geographical book at the hands of a knowledgeable traveler in journeys and news of past nations.\n\nMuhammad Amin Al-Dinnawi",

    "text": "Biography of the Author (1)\nHe is Ahmad ibn Abi Ya'qub Ishaq ibn Ja'far ibn Wahb ibn Wadih, the Isfahani Writer and Chronicler famous as Al-Ya'qubi, and as Ibn Wadih. He used to be called: Mawla (Client) of Banu al-Abbas, and Mawla of Banu Hashim, because his grandfather was one of the clients of al-Mansur al-Dawaniqi, the Abbasid Caliph. He was a researcher in history and news of countries. He gave exploration its due right in his travels in the lands, east and west. He entered the land of Persia and prolonged his stay in the land of Armenia, being there in the year 260 [AH]. He also entered India and the Arab countries, then the Levant, then the Maghreb to Al-Andalus. He immersed himself deeply in research, so he began questioning the people of the regions about them and about themselves, their customs, sects, governments, and the distances between lands. If he trusted their transmission, he recorded it in his book. He mentioned who conquered the lands among the Caliphs and Emirs and the amount of their land tax, leaving no small or large detail he came across without counting it in the book. Thus, his compilation \"Kitab Al-Buldan\" became the oldest geographical source, and the most trustworthy due to the effort, trouble, care, and good performance he endured in its composition. His prominence was in the third century because he was alive in the year 292 AH; on the night of Eid al-Fitr of that year, he remembered what the Banu Tulun used to enjoy on such a night of luxurious living, ample comfort, and abundant wealth, and he elegized them with verses beginning with: [Al-Kamil meter]\nIf you ask about the majesty of their kingdom ... Then pasture and stop by the grazing grounds of the square.\nTherefore, what is in Mu'jam al-Udaba' (Dictionary of Writers) from Abu Umar Muhammad ibn Yusuf ibn Ya'qub al-Misri in his history that Al-Ya'qubi died in the year 284 [AH] is hardly correct, nor what Al-Zirikli mentioned in",

The First: \"On Ancient History in general from Adam and what followed to the appearance of Islam,\" including the news of the Israelites, Syrians, Indians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, Nubians, Beja, Zanj, Himyarites, Ghassanids, and Lakhmids (Munadhira). And the Second: \"On the History of Islam, ending in the time of Al-Mu'tamid Ala Allah, the fifteenth of the Abbasid Caliphs,\" meaning to the year 259 [AH]. He arranged it according to the Caliphs. Among the features distinguishing it from other general histories, besides its antiquity, is that its author brings forth the core of history and investigates true issues, which only a characteristic historian commits to. Thus, he dictates to you the facts and correct events as if you witnessed them yourself and saw them with your own eyes, with smooth expression and an attractive style. Also among his works is \"Kitab Al-Buldan\" in geography, which is this book we present to the honorable readers. It was first printed in Leiden in the year 1861 [AD] under the care of the orientalist \"Juynboll\", and was also printed within the Geographical Library series in which eight volumes of Arabic geographical books were printed under the care of the orientalist \"de Goeje\". We have informed you of the importance of the book, its author's effort with it, and the extent of trust in it. Also among his works is a small book on \"News of Past Nations\", and a book \"The Conformity of People to Their Time\". These four books are the ones mentioned by Yaqut al-Hamawi in Al-Mu'jam. It appears from the end of the printed copy of \"Kitab Al-Buldan\" that he has another book he named the book of \"Al-Mamalik wa al-Masalik\" (The Kingdoms and Routes). The subject of the biography was a poet, and his prominence was before Al-Tabari and Al-Masudi. Among his exquisite poetry is his description of Samarkand (1): [Al-Munsarih meter]",

So whenever I met a man from those countries, I asked him about his homeland and region. If he mentioned to me the location of his abode and the place of his settlement, I asked him about that country of his regarding... its fertility (1), what is it? And its crops, what are they? And its inhabitants, who are they, Arabs or non-Arabs? ... the drink of its people, until I ask about their clothing ... and their religions and sects, and those dominant over it and the Minra (2) ... the distance of that country, and what countries are close to it... and the riding camels. Then I recorded everything informed to me by one whom I trust in his truthfulness, and I sought verification by questioning group after group, until I asked many people, and a world of people during the Hajj season and other than the season, from the people of the East and the West. I wrote down their news, narrated their hadiths, and mentioned who conquered country by country, and garrisoned region by region (3) among the Caliphs and Emirs, and the amount of its land tax and what rises from its wealth. I continued writing these news and composing this book for a long time, attributing every report to its country, and everything I hear from trustworthy people of the regions to what knowledge I had previously acquired.",

He stopped at the monastery and spoke to the monks in it, saying: \"What is the name of this place?\" One of the monks said to him: \"We find in our ancient books that this place is called Surra Man Ra'a, and that it was the city of Shem, son of Noah, and that it will be inhabited after ages at the hands of a majestic, victorious, triumphant king who has companions whose faces are like the faces of the birds of the wilderness; he will settle in it, and his son will settle in it.\" He [Al-Mu'tasim] said: \"I, by Allah, will build it and settle in it, and my son will settle in it. Al-Rashid commanded one day that his children go out to hunt, so I went out with Muhammad and Al-Ma'mun and the elder children of Al-Rashid. Each one of us caught some game, and I caught an owl. Then we returned and presented our game to him. The servants who were with us began saying: 'This is the game of So-and-so, and this is the game of So-and-so,' until my game was presented to him. When he saw the owl—and the servants had feared presenting it lest he take it as a bad omen or I receive harshness from him—he said: 'Who caught this?' They said: 'Abu Ishaq.' He rejoiced and laughed and showed pleasure, then said: 'Lo, indeed he will attain the Caliphate, and his army and his companions and those prevailing over him will be people whose faces are like the face of this owl. He will build an ancient city, and these people will settle in it, then his son will settle in it after him.' Al-Rashid was not pleased that day by any game as he was pleased by my catching of that owl.\" Then Al-Mu'tasim resolved to settle in that place. He summoned Muhammad ibn Abdul Malik Al-Zayyat (2), Ibn Abi Du'ad, Umar ibn Faraj, and Ahmad ibn Khalid known as Abu al-Wazir, and said to them: \"Buy this land from the owners of this monastery and pay them its price, four thousand dinars (3).\" They did that.

Markets were made there for the people of professions in the city. Al-Mu'tasim built the cultivations as palaces, placing in every orchard a palace with sitting rooms, pools, and squares. The cultivations became beautiful, and the notables desired to have even the slightest land there. They competed for that, and the Jarib (2) of land reached a large sum.

Al-Wathiq built the palace known as Al-Haruni on the Tigris and made sitting rooms in it on an eastern platform and a western platform. He moved into it, and land grants increased. He brought some people close and moved others' houses further away by steps not by distances. He granted Wasif the house of Afshin in Al-Matira. Wasif moved from his old house to Afshin's house and continued to live there, with his companions and men around him.

Market people, professionals, and artisans found space in those shops and markets in the rows of the Congregational Mosque.

He granted land to Muhammad ibn Musa the astronomer, his brothers, and a group of scribes, commanders, Hashimites, and others. Al-Mutawakkil resolved to build a city to move to, to be attributed to him, and through which he would be remembered. He ordered Muhammad ibn Musa the astronomer and the engineers present at his gate to choose a location. Their choice fell on a place called Al-Mahuzah. It was said to him: Al-Mu'tasim intended to build a city here and dig a canal that existed in ancient times. He resolved on that and began looking into it in the year forty-five [245 AH]. He sent for digging that canal to be in the middle of the city. The cost was estimated at one million five hundred thousand dinars. He was pleased with that and accepted it. Digging began, and great funds were spent on that canal. The location of his palaces and houses was planned. He granted land to his crown princes, other children, commanders, scribes, army, and all people. He extended the Great Street from the house of Ashnas in Karkh, which went to Al-Fath ibn Khaqan, a distance of three farsakhs to his palaces. Before his palaces, he placed three great majestic gates through which a horseman enters with his lance. He granted land to people on the right and left of the Great Street. He made the width of the Great Street two hundred cubits. He planned to dig two rivers on the sides of the street in which water flows from the large river he was digging. Palaces were built, houses erected, and construction rose. He used to go around himself; whomever he saw diligent in building, he rewarded and gave, so people were diligent.

Markets were placed in a separate location, and a market was made in every square and district. He built the Congregational Mosque. Al-Mutawakkil moved to the palaces of this city on the first day of Muharram in the year two hundred and forty-seven. When he sat, he rewarded people with splendid gifts, connected them, and gave to all commanders, scribes, and those who held any office. His joy was complete, and he said: \"Now I know that I am a king, when I built a city for myself and inhabited it.\" The Bureaus were transferred: the Bureau of Land Tax, Bureau of Estates, Bureau of Control (Zimam), Bureau of the Army and Shakiriyah, Bureau of Clients and Servants, Bureau of Post, and all Bureaus. However, the canal was not completed, and water did not flow in it except a weak flow that had no continuity or straightness, even though about a million dinars had been spent on it. But its digging was very difficult; they were digging through gypsum and stones (1) that pickaxes could not work on. Al-Mutawakkil remained residing in his palaces in Al-Ja'fariyah for nine months and three days. He was killed on the third of Shawwal in the year two hundred and forty-seven in his Ja'fari palace, the most ominous of palaces.

People moved and carried the debris of the houses to Surra Man Ra'a. The palaces, houses, dwellings, and markets of Al-Ja'fari were ruined in the quickest time. The place became desolate with no companion or inhabitant, and the abodes became empty wastes (3) as if they had never been built or inhabited.

He granted land to Abu Abdullah al-Jadali in Bajila.

The plans changed and came to be known by people who bought them later and built. Each tribe had a cemetery known by them and their leaders, among them: Cemetery of 'Arzam, Cemetery of Bishr, Cemetery of Azd, Cemetery of Salim, Cemetery of Murad, Cemetery of Kindah, Cemetery of the Sa'idis, Sahara (Desert) of Athir, Sahara of Banu Yashkur, and Sahara of Banu Amir.

Another type leans towards blackness; they know it and avoid it. Perhaps some were ignorant of it and died from touching it, especially if their hand had sweated or was moist. Some Caliphs used to order that someone be entrusted with the ships coming from the land of India to Al-Ubullah and other ports to inspect the spikenard and test it. The Bish would be extracted from it, taken with iron pincers, and no one touched it but that he died instantly. That used to be collected in a container and sometimes thrown into the sea. Cloves. Ahmad ibn Abi Ya'qub said: Cloves (1) are all one genus. Its best and finest is the dry, desiccated flower, pungent, sharp-tasting, sweet-smelling. From it is the flower and from it is the fruit. The flower of it is what is small and resembles the sticks of the branches of black hellebore in appearance. The fruit of it is what is thick and resembles date pits or olive stones. It is said it is the fruit of large trees resembling the lote tree. Others said (etc.). He said: It is imported from the lands of Sofala of India and its furthest parts. In the places where it is, it has very sharp, radiating scents, so much so that they call the places of cloves the Scent of Paradise due to the sharpness of its scent (etc.). Ghawali (Perfumes).

Except that this oil is not suitable for Ghawali because it overpowers the scents of ambergris and musk with the scents of spices and their sharpness. Kings do not use it except to oil their hands in winter, and women use it in their perfumes and veils. Apple Water. As for apple water and its distillation from which it is made, Al-Tamimi said from Ahmad ibn Abi Ya'qub regarding the making of perfumed apple water: You take Levantine apples etc. Pills to Remove Bad Breath.

He said: He took it from Ahmad ibn Abi Ya'qub, and it is etc. Naming the Christians of Al-Hirah 'Al-Ibad'. Ahmad ibn Abi Ya'qub said: The Christians of Al-Hirah were named Al-Ibad (The Servants/Worshippers) only because five of them came as a delegation to Khosrow. He said to one of them: What is your name? He said: Abd al-Masih (Servant of the Messiah). He said to the second: What is your name? He said: Abd Yalil. He said to the third: What is your name? He said: Abd Yasu' (Servant of Jesus). He said to the fourth: What is your name? He said: Abdullah (Servant of Allah). He said to the fifth: What is your name? He said: Abd Amr. Khosrow said: You are all 'Ibad (Servants), so they were named Al-Ibad. What Caliphs and Kings Spent. Ahmad ibn Abi Ya'qub, from the descendants of Ja'far ibn Wahb, said: Al-Wathiq distributed in his days wealth in charity, gifts, and acts of righteousness in Baghdad, Samarra, Kufa, Basra, Medina, and Mecca five million dinars.

He distributed it among the merchants whose wealth was lost in the fire, so their conditions improved, and they built their markets with gypsum and baked brick and made the doors of their shops iron doors. Ahmad the Scribe said: He (Ahmad ibn Tulun) spent on it (the Mosque) one hundred and twenty thousand dinars. The craftsmen said to him: On what example should the minaret be made? He never fiddled in a council, but he took a roll of paper and began fiddling with it, so some of it came out and some remained in his hand. Those present were amazed. He said: Make the minaret on this example (spiral), so they made it. When the building of the Mosque was completed, Ahmad ibn Tulun saw in his dream as if Allah Almighty had manifested to the Maqsura around the Mosque but did not manifest to the Mosque. He asked the interpreters, and they said: What is around it will be ruined and it will remain standing alone. He said: From where did you get this? They said: From the saying of the Almighty: \"And when his Lord manifested to the mountain, He made it crumbled to dust\" [Al-A'raf: 143]. And his saying (Prophet), peace be upon him: \"If Allah manifests to something, it humbles itself to Him\" (1). And it was as they said.",

Muhammad (Ahmad) ibn Abi Ya'qub the Scribe narrated, saying: When it was the night of Eid al-Fitr of the year 292 (1), I remembered what the family of Ibn Tulun (2) were in on such a night, of beautiful attire with weapons, colored banners and flags, famous (or month/fame) clothes, abundance of horses, and sounds of trumpets and drums. A thought (a lesson and a thought) overcame me because of that. I slept that night and heard a caller saying: Kingship, possession, and ornamentation have gone... when the Banu Tulun passed away. Ahmad ibn Abi Ya'qub said: If you ask about the majesty of their reign... graze and turn to the pastures of the square. Look at those palaces and what they contained... and frolic in the bloom of that garden. If you take a lesson, in it also is a lesson... informing you how the two eras (night and day) change.",

It (the dominion) was driven to the family of Prophecy and Guidance... and torn away from the party of Satan. Similar to this is what Al-Ya'qubi recounted, he said: ... I headed to the door of Hamduna, daughter of Al-Rashid. Daqaq, her client, came out, and in her hand was a fan on which was written on the first face: The vulva is more in need of two penises than the penis is of two vulvas. On the second side of the fan was written: Just as the millstone (1) is more in need of two mules than the mule is of two millstones. Description of Samarkand. Ibn al-Wadih al-Ya'qubi said in describing Samarkand: Samarkand rose so it is said of it... The Adornment of Khorasan, the Paradise of Districts. Are not its towers suspended... where they cannot be discerned by sight? And below its towers are its trenches... deep, no breach can be attempted. As if it, while in the middle of its wall... surrounded by shadows and trees, is a full moon. Its rivers are the Galaxy and the... fortresses are like the shining stars.",
