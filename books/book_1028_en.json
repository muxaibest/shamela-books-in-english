    "text": "Introduction 1 - Name of the Book: Its name, as it appeared on the first folio of the manuscript, is \"The Book of Approximation of the Definition of Logic, the words of the unique leader Aristotle and others, which the unique and most learned Imam Abu Muhammad Ali bin Ahmed bin Saeed bin Hazm took care to explain?\". Ibn Hazm referred to it multiple times in his book *Al-Fisal fi al-Milal wa al-Nihal*; he said in a chapter regarding the nature of proofs, \"This is a chapter we have mastered in our book marked as *Al-Taqrib* (The Approximation) in the definitions of speech\" (1). He said in another place, \"This is a sophistry we have long warned against in our books which we compiled on the definitions of Logic\" (2), so he applied the name \"The Books\" to this book because it is composed of eight books. He mentioned it a third time in *Al-Fisal*, saying: \"We have explained in the book *Al-Taqrib* regarding the definitions of speech that the instrument called the Giraffe? etc.\" (3). He said a fourth time, \"According to the premises we explained in our book marked as *Al-Taqrib* regarding the essence of proof\" (4), so he referred in this naming to a specific part of the book. Mention of this book appeared in what Ibn Hazm al-Andalusi wrote according to both Al-Humaydi in *Al-Jadhwah* and Sa'id in *Tabaqat al-Umam*. Al-Humaydi said: \"*The Approximation of the Definition of Logic and the Introduction to it with Common Expressions and Jurisprudential Examples*; for in clarifying it, removing suspicion about it, and belying...",

    "text": "...the impostors using it, he followed a path that no one before him had followed, as far as we know\" (1). This title is the most accurate of what is there, and it is exactly what is established fully on folio (55) of the book *Al-Taqrib*. As for Sa'id, he said: \"He concerned himself with the science of Logic and composed a book on it which he named *The Approximation of the Definitions of Logic*, in which he elaborated on clarifying the paths of knowledge, used jurisprudential examples and legal maxims, and disagreed with Aristotle, the founder of this science, in some of his principles—the disagreement of one who did not understand his purpose nor had exercised himself in his book; thus, his book, because of this, contains many errors and clear omissions\" (2). It seems that Ibn Hayyan, the historian of al-Andalus, saw this statement by Sa'id and repeated it without mentioning the name *Al-Taqrib*, as he said: \"Abu Muhammad was a bearer of various arts of Hadith, Fiqh, dialectics, genealogy, and what relates to the fringes of literature, along with participation in many types of ancient teachings of Logic and Philosophy. He has many books in some of those arts in which he was not free from error and omission, due to his boldness in scaling the walls of the arts, especially Logic; for they claimed that he slipped there, and went astray in treading the paths, and disagreed with Aristotle, its founder—the disagreement of one who did not understand his purpose, nor had exercised himself in his books\" (3). Sa'id and Ibn Hayyan agreed on the statement that Ibn Hazm erred in understanding some principles of Aristotle's words, and their opinion is one view because the latter relied on the former. This is a matter I will address in what follows. 2 - When was this book written: Ibn Hazm's references to the book *Al-Fisal* do not indicate to us that *Al-Taqrib* predates *Al-Fisal* in time, for we noted in the previous paragraph that he also referred to *Al-Taqrib* within the book *Al-Fisal* itself. This may indicate that he worked on both books without completing one before the other and that he was alternating work between them. In the book *Al-Taqrib*, he also refers to two other books: *The Book of Politics* and *The Book of Ethics of the Soul*. We do not know the date of his authorship of these two books either, but *Al-Taqrib* precedes them because when he mentions them, he says \"as we will explain in?\", so he attached his speech to the future, and indicated...\n\nThe Approximation of the Definition of Logic. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. \"O God, send blessings upon the Master of Messengers and upon the family of Muhammad and his companions and grant peace.\" The unique, most learned Imam, Abu Muhammad Ali bin Ahmed bin Saeed bin Hazm bin Ghalib bin Salih bin Khalaf bin Ma'dan bin Yazid al-Farisi said: Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, Originator of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, Possessor of the Glorious Throne, Doer of what He intends. And may God bless Muhammad, His servant and the seal of His prophets and His messengers to His servants from among the living souls capable of death, from mankind and jinn, with the religion by which He chose them, so that he who obeys him may dwell in Paradise, which is the abode of eternal bliss, and he who disobeys him may enter the Fire, which is the place of everlasting torment; and our success is only by God Almighty, and there is no power and no strength except by God, the Mighty, the Majestic. As for what follows: The First, the One, the Truth, the Creator of all existents other than Himself, says in His revelation which He gave to His Prophet and His sanctified friend: {God is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things, Disposer of affairs} (39 Az-Zumar: 62). And the Almighty said: {And they give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth} (3 Aal Imran: 191), praising them. And the Almighty said: {The Most Merciful. Taught the Qur'an. Created man. Taught him eloquence} (55 Ar-Rahman: 3). And the Almighty said: {Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous - Who taught by the pen - Taught man that which he knew not} (96 Al-Alaq: 3).",

    "text": "...that he had not yet started composing them at that time, but rather had defined a methodology for himself there. Ibn Hazm says in *Al-Taqrib*: \"We did not compose this book of ours, and much of what we composed, except while we were exiled, banished from home, family, and child, fearing alongside that for our lives from injustice and aggression\" (1). This statement, despite its utility, does not define anything precise; it merely informs us that *Al-Taqrib*, like his other works, was written after leaving Cordoba and starting to move around the cities of Al-Andalus. In *Al-Taqrib*, there are important indications that point to the timing, which are: 1 - Ibn Hazm narrates a story about his tutor Ahmed bin Muhammad bin Abdul Warith and asks for mercy upon him (2), but unfortunately, we cannot benefit from this fact because I did not find a date for this man's death. 2 - Ibn Hazm talks in the book about the incident of his arrest at the hands of Al-Mustakfi (3), because Ibn Hazm was loyal to Al-Mustazhir, and this happened in the year 414 or late 413 at the latest estimation. 3 - He mentions that his friend Ibn Shahid composed a book on the science of rhetoric while he himself was writing the book *Al-Taqrib* (4). Ibn Shahid died in the year 426 and stopped composing a year or more before that. This determines that the book *Al-Taqrib*, or some chapters of it, were written before that. We add to these indications the statement of Sa'id: \"And his son, the jurist Abu Muhammad, was a minister for Abdul Rahman Al-Mustazhir... then he abandoned this path and turned to reading sciences and recording traditions and Sunan, so he concerned himself with the science of Logic... and after that, he delved deeply into increasing his knowledge of the sciences of Sharia\" (5). Thus, he did not begin his studies, according to Sa'id, until after the year 414, and Logic was among the first sciences he turned to... \"And after\" that, he delved into Sharia sciences, accumulating them. All these evidences combined place the date of *Al-Taqrib* after the year 415 and before the year 425 AH. 3 - Reasons for its authorship: Ibn Hazm spent part of his youth seeking knowledge in Cordoba until the year 401. It affected him in that early stage of his life what he heard some inexperienced people say about Logic and...\n\nThese verses are comprehensive of the aspects of expression (Bayan) which the Mighty and Majestic bestowed upon the rational beings of His creation, favoring them with it over all other animals, a favor from Him, the Exalted, which He grants to whom He wills, and God is the Possessor of Great Bounty. We found Him, the Mighty and Majestic, enumerating among His great blessings upon the one He first created of the human species, His teaching him the names of things; for the Almighty said: {And He taught Adam the names - all of them} (2 Al-Baqarah: 31). This is what distinguishes angels, humans, and jinn from all other living souls; it is the expression regarding all existing things, despite their different aspects, and the clarification of their meanings, which, due to their differences, necessitated that their names differ, and the knowledge of the categorization of named things under names. So whoever is ignorant of the magnitude of this blessing within himself and the rest of his species, and does not know its position with him, is not superior to beasts except in physical form; so praise be to God for what He taught and gave, there is no god but He. And whoever does not know the attributes of the named things, which necessitate the differentiation of their names, and defines all of that with their definitions, has been ignorant of the magnitude of this precious blessing, and has passed it by heedless of knowing it, turning away from it; and he has not failed a minor failure, but a very grave one. If an ignorant person says: Did any of the Pious Ancestors (Salaf) speak about this? It is said to him: This knowledge is settled in the soul of every person of [2v] intellect. The sharp mind reaches, with what understanding God Almighty has enabled in it, the benefits of this knowledge, while the ignorant person is withdrawn like the blind until he is alerted to it; and so are all sciences. None of the Pious Ancestors, may God be pleased with them, spoke on issues of Grammar, but when the ignorance of people spread regarding the variation of vowel markings—by the variation of which meanings in the Arabic language vary—scholars established books of Grammar. Thus, they removed great ambiguity, and that was an aid to understanding the speech of God Almighty and the speech of His Prophet, peace be upon him. Whoever was ignorant of that was deficient in understanding his Lord, the Exalted. So this action by the scholars was good and necessitated reward for them. The same is said regarding the compilation of books by scholars on Language and Jurisprudence; for the Pious Ancestors had no need for all of that due to the virtue God gave them and their witnessing of Prophethood. Those after them were in need of all that; this is seen through senses and the deficiency of one who does not study these sciences and does not read these books is known, and that he is close in relation to beasts. Likewise is this science [Logic]; for whoever is ignorant of it, the structure of the speech of God Almighty and the speech of His Prophet, peace be upon him, is hidden from him, and...",

    "text": "...Philosophical sciences in general without verification. Those are the ones he meant by his saying: \"And I have seen groups of losers whom I witnessed during the prime of our seeking [knowledge], and before our powers were firmly established in knowledge, and at our first involvement with various people of different opinions; they used to decide based on their corrupt conjectures without certainty produced by trustworthy research that Philosophy and the definitions of Logic are contrary to the Sharia\" (1). Perhaps the environment of Cordoba and Andalusia in general—at that time, with its hostility towards the sciences of the Ancients—was what stimulated his curiosity, making him study Philosophy and Logic. Hence, the feeling grew strong in him that Philosophical sciences do not contradict the Sharia; rather, Logic specifically can be taken as a standard to evaluate Sharia opinions and correct them. His direction towards debating people of other sects and creeds imposed on him to arm himself with logical strength in debate and argumentation. These two goals were among the first factors that led him to write on Logic to prove the lack of contradiction between it and the Sharia, to reinforce his intellectual position against opponents, to establish correct rules for argumentation and debate, and to clarify the tricks of sophistry and rioting. Ibn Hazm remained of this opinion, believing in the benefit of Logic, Philosophy, and all sciences of the Ancients—except Astrology. In the epistle *Maratib al-Ulum* (The Hierarchy of Sciences), he advises the student, after learning reading, writing, the principles of Grammar, Language, Poetry, and Astronomy, to look into the definitions of Logic, the science of genera and species, singular names, propositions, premises, syllogisms, and conclusions, to know what proof is and what riot is, and to distinguish them from falsehoods a distinction that leaves no doubt (2). Someone asks him his opinion on the people of his time and how they divided into two groups: a group that followed the sciences of the Ancients and a group that followed the science of what Prophecy brought, asking him to explain which one is correct. He says in the answer: Know—may God grant us and you success to what pleases Him—that the sciences of the Ancients are Philosophy and the definitions of Logic which Plato, his student Aristotle, Alexander, and those who followed their footsteps spoke about. This is a fine, elevated science because in it is the knowledge of the whole world with all that is in it from its genera to its species, to the individuals of its substances and accidents, and standing upon the proof without which nothing is valid, and distinguishing it from what is thought to be proof out of ignorance but is not proof. The benefit of this science is great in distinguishing truths from others... (3)\n\n...sophistry passes upon him as valid, and he does not differentiate between it and the truth. He does not know his religion except by imitation (Taqlid), and imitation is blameworthy; and it is likely, if he is safe from confusion—we seek refuge in God from it. For this reason, and what we will mention after this, God willing, it became necessary to hasten to compose this science, and to toil in explaining and expanding it, by the power and strength of God. We say, and we seek God's help: All things which the First—who has no first absolutely other than Him—brought into being, and which the One—who has no 'one' by way of correction, far be it from Him—divided, and which the Creator—who has no creator in reality except Him—invented; their ranks in the aspects of manifestation (Bayan) are four, having no fifth at all. If one of them decreases, the manifestation is disrupted by the amount of that decrease. The first of these is the existence of things as real in themselves (Ontology); for if they are real, their manifestation is possible. If they do not have a manifestor existing at that time, this is the first rank of manifestation; for what is not existing, there is no way to its manifestation. The Second Aspect: Their manifestation to the one who perceived them, and the transfer of their forms and attributes to his soul (mind), and its settlement therein via the material of the intellect by which the rational person is favored among souls, and his distinguishing of them as they are; for he to whom a thing is not clear, his knowledge of it and reporting about it is not valid. This is the second rank of the ranks of manifestation. The Third Aspect: Producing composed words from distinct letters, for which the Wise [3r] and Capable enabled exits from the chest, throat, tubes of the lung, palate, tongue, lips, and teeth; and He prepared for them the air propelled by the knocking of the tongue to the auditory meatus of the ears. Thereby, the soul of the speaker conveys the likeness of what it has perceived and what has settled in it to the soul of the listener, transferring it to it with an understood sound through the nature's acceptance of a language they agreed upon. Thus, what the speaker's soul has perceived becomes clear, and it settles in the listener's soul just as it has settled in the speaker's soul, and the likeness of what is with him goes out to it, as a kindness from the Subtle, the Aware. This is to produce, by what He granted us of this noble property, elevated power, and virtuous nature...",

    "text": "This belief in the benefit of the sciences of Philosophy and Logic is what made Ibn Hazm, after studying them, attempt to convey what he understood of them simply to others. This direction earned him the enmity of the group that hated Philosophy and Logic, which was the dominant group in Andalusia at that time. His enemies took this aspect of him as a target for their attacks. An example of this is that one of the resentful people wrote him an unsigned letter accusing him that corruption entered him from his reliance on the books of the Ancients, the Materialists (Dahriyya), the Logicians, the book of Euclid, the Almagest, and other atheists. So Ibn Hazm wrote in response: Tell us about these books of Logic, Euclid, and Almagest: Did you read them, O you who denied that for yourself? And tell us about the atheism you found in them if you have stood upon its places in them; and if you have not read them, how do you deny what you do not know? (1). Ibn Hazm came to believe that the benefit of Logic is a matter no fair person doubts because it is a benefit not stopping at the borders of knowledge and mental exercise, but intervenes in all sciences: Religion, Articles of Faith, Desires, Grammar, Language, History (News), Medicine, Geometry, and whatever is of this form; it is worthy that it be sought and books be written on it, and difficult truths be approximated in it. This belief in the value and benefit of Logic became—initially—a strong incentive to write on it. However, Ibn Hazm faced two difficulties in his study of this science, so why not attempt to overcome them for the reader who wishes to benefit from the study of Logic? The First: The complexity of translation and the presentation of this science in words that are not common (vernacular). By 'common', Ibn Hazm means widespread, familiar words that people understand due to frequent circulation. So let him write, then, a book close to understandings, \"for the fortune belongs to him who prefers knowledge and knows its merit, that he simplifies it with his effort, brings it closer as much as he can, and lightens it as possible\" (2). He thinks well of the translators and sees that their making words difficult was a miserliness with knowledge and hoarding of it when people were serious about seeking it, spending the precious and valuable for it. The Second Difficulty: Logicians have been accustomed to using symbols and letters in giving examples. Something like this is difficult for the general public to handle. So let Ibn Hazm convert the examples from symbols to others extracted from the familiar in daily and Sharia conditions. He senses the danger of what he is undertaking. And he believes that he is the first to attempt this endeavor.\n\n...which brings the one who uses it in His obedience closer to the eternal success of His pleasure and immortality in His Paradise; a result by which he is distinguished from the beasts upon whom there is no reward or punishment, and which He subjected to us among what He subjected, and made subservient to our command along with what He made subservient, as He created for us what is in the heavens and the earth, except what He prohibited for us and excepted by forbidding it to us. So to Him belongs praise and thanks from us, and hearing and obedience are upon us. And from His completing that for us by His grace and bounty, God Almighty said: {And We sent not a messenger except in the language of his people to make clear to them} (14 Ibrahim: 4). This is the third rank of the ranks of manifestation. The Fourth Aspect: Signs that occur by agreement, the mainstay of which is outlining what has settled in the soul of the mentioned manifestation, with contrasting lines having a color different from the color of what is written upon, agreed upon by the sound mentioned previously. It is called a Book (Writing), represented by the hand which is an instrument for that. Thus, the soul of the writer conveys what it has perceived to the soul that wants to share with it in perceiving what it has perceived; so the eye, which is an instrument for that, delivers it to it. This applies in distant regions and across divergent distances where the air called sound disperses before reaching them, and it cannot be delivered to those therein to inform them of that without informing those neighboring in the place whom one does not wish to inform. Were it not for this mode, the wisdom of the dead would not have reached us over the eons of time, nor would we have known the knowledge of those gone in past ages, nor would the news of past nations and empty centuries have ended up to us. Included in this section are things that clarify but are not widespread [words]; among them are signs by the hand only, and among them are signs by the eye or some limbs. It may be possible to convey manifestation by tastes; from that is what the blind person perceives of manifestation regarding the present object alone according to what is agreed upon with the one signaling that to him. This is the fourth rank of the ranks of manifestation [3v], since there is no way to the Book (Writing) except after agreeing on distinguishing those lines by the sounds assigned to them—a rarity which minds were incapable of fully knowing. The One, First, True Creator stood alone in managing that and inventing it without a cause necessitating that upon Him, except that He does what He wills; there is no adjuster of His judgment, and He is not questioned about what He does, but they are questioned. The utmost virtue became what we mentioned, and its usage in its aspects, and the acknowledgment to the First, One, True Creator of power, ability, and knowledge...",

    "text": "Ibn Hazm did not write this book until he was motivated by many reasons in daily life, and only after he found the need for Logic pressing in practical aspects of people's relationships and thinking. He met someone who described him by asking about the difference between the Subject (Mahmul) and the Possibility (Mutmakkin), and he met many rioters adopting sophistry in argumentation. He faced someone asking him to show him the Accident sifted from the Substance. He read complex writings with no point beneath their complexity. He saw someone claiming wisdom while being innocent of it. So he wanted his book to be a rectification of the crookedness of these matters and a reform of their corruption, a refutation of opponents and rioters, and an establishment of the correct rules for debate, which was at that time a preoccupation of the scholars of Andalusia. - 4 Sources of the Book: Since the era of translation began in the history of Arab thought, translators and the commentators after them began to care for the logical books of Aristotle. It is attributed to Ibn al-Muqaffa that he transferred three of the Aristotelian logic books: Categories (Qatighuriyas), De Interpretatione (Peri Hermeneias), and Analytics (Analutiqa), and that he translated the Introduction known as Isagoge? And he expressed what he translated of that in an easy phrase close to grasp (1). Timothy the Catholicos, who contacted Al-Rashid and Al-Ma'mun, mentions that the Caliph \"ordered us to translate the book Topics (Topica) by Aristotle the Philosopher from Syriac to Arabic. Sheikh Abu Nuh performed this with the help of God\" (2). Timothy believes that the translations done before that were meager, not only in terms of words but in terms of meanings. The author of *Al-Fihrist* left us a picture of the efforts of translators and abbreviators of the eight logical books (3). It is a statement indicating what was exerted by Al-Kindi, Ahmed bin al-Tayyib, Thabit bin Qurra, Matta bin Yunus al-Qana'i, Al-Farabi, Yahya bin Adi, and others in this field: 1 - As for Al-Kindi, he has a treatise on the Introduction, summarized and brief, a treatise on the Ten Categories, a treatise on guarding against the tricks of the Sophists, and a treatise on the brevity and abridgment of Logical Demonstration.\n\n...and that He is distinct from His creation in all their attributes. After: The sages who passed before our time collected books in which they arranged the distinctions of the occurrence of named things under names upon which all nations agreed in their meanings, even if they differed in their names by which expression occurs about them; for nature is one, and choice is different and diverse. They arranged how the manifestation of known things stands from the compositions of these names, what is valid of that and what is not valid. They tracked these matters, defined definitions for that, and removed ambiguity. So God Almighty brought great benefit through them, brought the distant close, eased the difficult, and humbled the proud [in] seeking truths. Among them are the eight books of Aristotle collected in the definitions of Logic. And we say the saying of one who desires his One, First Creator to guide and protect him, and attributes to himself no power or strength except by Him, nor knowledge except what He taught him: From the righteousness by which we hope to be envied with our Lord Almighty is the explanation of those books due to their great benefit. For we saw people regarding them in four categories: Three of them are an ugly error and a heinous license, and the fourth is an abandoned truth, an obscured correctness, and an oppressed science; and aiding the oppressed is a duty and a reward. One of the four categories is a group who judged those books as containing disbelief (Kufr) and supporting atheism, without standing upon their meanings or reviewing them by reading. This, while they recite the saying of God Almighty—and they are the ones intended by it when He says: {And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned.} (17 Al-Isra: 36). And His saying Almighty: {Here you are - those who have argued about that of which you have [some] knowledge, but why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge?} (3 Aal Imran: 66). And His saying Almighty: {Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"} (27 An-Naml: 64). So we saw great, abundant reward regarding this sect in removing this falsehood from their unjust souls which judge before verification, accepting without knowledge, deciding without proof, [4r] and lifting the major sin from them by their casting this corrupt suspicion upon innocent people with a safe courtyard, pure skin, and smooth surface regarding what...",

    "text": "2 - As for his student Ahmed bin al-Tayyib, he summarized Categories, De Interpretatione, Analytics I and II, and Isagoge. He has a book on the Dialectic Art on the doctrine of Aristotle from the book Sophist specifically by Aristotle. 3 - Thabit has De Interpretatione, Compendiums of Analytics I, an Abridgment of Logic, anecdotes preserved from Topics, and a book on the fallacies of the Sophists. 4 - The leadership of the logicians ended up with Matta in his era, and most of his efforts were directed towards transmission (translation); he also interpreted the four books on Logic in their entirety, and people rely on them in reading. He has a commentary on Isagoge. 5 - The most far-reaching of them in impact on logical studies is Al-Farabi. He was not a translator but placed the logical books in an authoritative form and interpreted them in clear phrases that won the admiration of those who came after him, and his books became the preferred reference in this section. 6 - Another logician studied under him and under Matta, who attained leadership after them in Logic, namely Yahya bin Adi. From Yahya, Abu Sulayman al-Mantiqi derived—the teacher of al-Tawhidi and the sheikh of that band of students—who wrote an essay on the purposes of Aristotle's books, an essay on the meanings of Isagoge, and a book on the ambiguity in the four books of Logic. That is the situation in the East. As for Al-Andalus, the demand for Philosophy and Logic before the era of Al-Hakam Al-Mustansir was weak. The most famous person who cared for philosophical studies in general before the Berber Fitna (399) was Abu al-Qasim Maslama bin Ahmed al-Majriti. Some famous wise men of Al-Andalus studied under him, but he and most of his students leaned towards a mathematical direction with some interest in logical matters. This interest was shared by the first class of students of Logic in Al-Andalus, namely: Ibn Abdun al-Jabali, Omar bin Yunus bin Ahmed al-Harrani, Ahmed bin Hafsun, Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ibrahim the Judge, Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Masoud al-Bajjani, Muhammad bin Maimun known as Marcus, and Saeed bin Fathun al-Saraqusti. Ibn al-Kattani, Ibn Hazm's sheikh, studied under these (1). We add to these Andalusians interested in Logic: Malhan bin Ubayd Allah bin Salim...\n\n...they accused them of. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him—the intermediary between us and the First One—said: \"Whoever says to his brother 'O Disbeliever', it has become true of one of them.\" So we hope from our Creator that we be among those for whom a plentiful share is struck in lifting this distress, strictly on the day of our poverty for good deeds and our need for saving ourselves from what sinners fall into. He eases us towards a good sunnah (tradition) so we share the reward of whoever acts upon it after it, because we were the cause of his knowing it, without his reward being diminished at all. Thus the First Creator promised us on the tongue of His Messenger, peace be upon him. So these are one category. The Second Category: People who consider these books delirium of Logic and nonsense of speech. In general, most people are quick to be hostile to what they are ignorant of and to criticize what they do not know. It is as the Truthful One [the Prophet], peace be upon him, said: \"People are like a hundred camels; you can hardly find a riding mount among them.\" We also saw that among the aspects of righteousness is to make those who are ignorant understand this amount which we stipulated its virtue first; and by my life, that is not little, for by knowledge of this meaning we distance ourselves from beasts and understand the intent of the Creator, Mighty and Majestic, in His address to us. The Third Category: People who read these mentioned books with defective minds, afflicted desires, and unsound insights. Their hearts were imbued with the love of being taken lightly; they found the vehicle of incapacity soft, found the transmission of Sharia unwholesome, and accepted the saying of the ignorant. So they branded themselves with understanding them [the books], while they are the furthest of people from them and the most remote from knowing them. What we mentioned added to the confusion about these books and alienated people from them. So hope grew strong that in our explanation of what we explain of them, there will be a cause for the guidance of him for whom guidance was preordained in the knowledge of God Almighty; thus he wins the highest fortune and acquires the most sublime portion, if God Almighty wills. We did not find anyone before us who undertook this, so we hoped for the reward of God Almighty in that. The Fourth Category: People who looked with clear minds and thoughts pure from bias and sound intellects, so they were enlightened by them and stood upon their purposes. They were guided by their beacon, and Monotheism was established with them by necessary proofs from which there is no deviation. They witnessed the division of creatures and the effect of the Creator in them and His management of them. They found these virtuous books like the righteous companion and the sincere friend...",

    "text": "...who had insight into the definition of Logic and reading of philosophy books; and Al-Rabahi, who looked into Logics and mastered them (1); and two Jews, Munajjim bin al-Fawwal, a resident of Zaragoza who wrote a book on Logic in the manner of question and answer, and Marwan bin Janah, for whom no specific composition in Logic is mentioned (2). Based on this, Ibn Hazm would be from the men of the third class who devoted themselves to logical studies in Al-Andalus; indeed, he might be the most prominent of them in his era. I do not rule out that his sheikh Ibn al-Kattani had a far-reaching effect on his direction towards these studies, for he speaks of him in his books with admiration and appreciation (3). But to what extent were the Eastern translations, commentaries, and summaries known in Al-Andalus? Neither Judge Sa'id tells us anything of that, nor does Ibn Hazm in the book *Al-Taqrib* indicate anything clear and precise. All we can say in this regard does not exceed hypothesis and estimation. We can assume that Easterners traveling to Al-Andalus like Al-Harrani, and Andalusians traveling to the East like Ibn Abdun al-Jabali, transferred with them, among the books they transferred, some of the translations in Logic. It is not unlikely that Ibn Hazm benefited from some of them and relied on them as he relied on some works of the Andalusians themselves. Indeed, he says in some of his comments in *Al-Taqrib*: \"The Sheikh said: These are the phrases of the translators, and they contain confusion because they decided that the Sketch (Rasm) is not taken from genera and differentia, but rather it is taken from accidents and properties\" (4). His phrase stopped me because it speaks only of \"the translators\"? in the plural form—but because he prefaced it with his saying: 'The Sheikh said', and such a preface is not of what occurs in Ibn Hazm's books. Then research guided me to a phrase in *Kitab al-Radd ala al-Mantiqiyyin* (Refutation of the Logicians) by Ibn Taymiyya wherein it came: \"And for his veneration? meaning Ibn Hazm—of Logic, he narrated it with his chain of transmission to Matta the Translator who translated it into Arabic\" (5). This phrase solved some problems and created others; it informed us of the source utilized...\n\n...and the loyal friend [4v] who is not surrendered during hardship nor missed by his companion in distress except that he finds him with him. They did not walk a path of the paths of sciences except they found the benefit of the books in front of them and with them, nor did they climb a mountain pass of the passes of knowledge except they sensed their benefit inseparable from them. Rather, they familiarized every locked matter for them, and hinted at every obscure matter in all sciences. They were to them like the moneychanger (standard), and the things in which are properties to clarify their specifics. When we looked into that, we found some of the impediments calling for the calamities we mentioned to be the complexity of the translation in them and their presentation in words that are neither common nor of widespread usage. Not every understanding is suitable for every expression. So we drew near to God Almighty by presenting the meanings of these in easy, simple words, in the understanding of which the commoner and the elite, the scholar and the ignorant, are equal, God willing, according to their perception and what our Creator, Blessed and Exalted, granted us of power and capability. The reason that led the predecessors among the translators to obscure the words, make them rugged, and roughen the path towards them, was stinginess on their part with knowledge and hoarding it. It occurs to us that seekers of knowledge in those days, and those desiring it, were many and possessed of strong zeal. But as for now, people have renounced it, to the point of harming its people, terrorizing them, pursuing them, and attacking them. One is not content to leave it and his ignorance of it, but has become a caller against it and a forbidder of knowledge by his action and speech. They became as Habib bin Aws al-Ta'i [Abu Tammam] said describing them: \"They went forth as if ignorance gathers them... A father, and those of literature among them are extras (anomalies).\" For the fortune belongs to him who prefers knowledge and knows its merit, that he simplifies it with his effort, brings it closer as much as he can, and lightens it as possible. Indeed, if it were possible to shout it on the crossroads of passersby, invite to it in the streets of the wayfarers, call out about it in the gatherings of travelers; indeed, if it were easy for him to give money to its students, pay wages to those who acquire it, increase the payments for it to those searching for it, and elevate the ranks of its people, being patient in that over hardship and harm, that would be a fortune...",

    "text": "...Ibn Hazm in this book of his, which made me believe that the word \"Sheikh\" might refer to Matta al-Mantiqi himself. However, Ibn Hazm mentioned nothing about this Matta in this copy. Is the copy in our hands lacking that chain of transmission? We have the right in this situation to ask: Did Ibn Taymiyyah view the book *Al-Taqrib*? And if he did, why did he not discuss Ibn Hazm as he discussed other supporters of Logic? The strongest conjecture is that he viewed it but did not have it on hand when he composed his book, or that he did not see a threat to Eastern thought in a Maghrebi book, so he sufficed with attacking the books of the Easterners and refuting them. Furthermore: Were there special Andalusian translations other than those we assumed arrived from the East? There is no decisive answer to this question. All we can estimate here is that Ibn Hazm perhaps knew some Latin translations, for he knew this language, and he mentioned it in places in the book *Al-Taqrib*. He said: \"Whoever masters the Latin language knows the difference between the two meanings we intended in the interrogation\" (1). He said another time: \"This is clearly evident to us in the Latin language\" (2). And he said in a third place: \"For this meaning in Latin, there is a word of clear expression\" (3). It is not strange for Ibn Hazm to know Latin, as it was common in Andalusia at that time. As for Greek, there was no one who mastered it, and thus we find in *Al-Taqrib* suggestions that he did not know it (4). However, what draws attention is his discussion of some opinions as being things Aristotle did not say. Did he derive this from Matta al-Mantiqi, or did he know precise sources while quoting from those he calls \"The Ancients\"? There is another Eastern source which I suspect Ibn Hazm reviewed, which is a book—or books—authored by Al-Nashi' al-Akbar Abu al-Abbas, known as Ibn Shuraysh (d. 293). This Abu al-Abbas, the poet, was a Mu'tazilite who wrote in refutation of the Logicians and is among the first thinkers who tried to challenge the logic of Aristotle. Abu Sa'id al-Sirafi cited him in his debate with Matta al-Mantiqi—the debate preserved by Abu Hayyan in the book *Al-Imta' wa al-Mu'anasah*. It appears from what Ibn Hazm cited that some of Al-Nashi's opinions were a type of sophistry, and for that reason, he attacked him and described him as having much prattle.\n\n...abundant [reward], good work, a thankful and noble endeavor, and a revival of knowledge; otherwise, it would have been effaced, worn out, and hidden, except for a fulfilled oath, and nothing would remain of it but faint traces and effaced landmarks. And God is the One sought for help. We viewed these books like strong medicine; if a person of health and strong constitution, sound nature, firm composition, and good temperament takes it, he benefits from it, it clears his structure, removes his [bad] humors [5r], strengthens his senses, and balances his qualities. But if a sick person of disturbed temperament and frail composition takes it, it overcomes him, increases his affliction, and perhaps destroys and kills him. Likewise are these books: if a person of sharp intellect and strong understanding takes them, he will not lack—wherever he turns and however he proceeds in them—great benefit, illuminating guidance, clear expression, success in every science he undertakes, and good in his religion and worldly life. But if a person of silly intellect takes them, they invalidate him, and if a person of dull understanding takes them, they stupefy and confuse him. So let every man partake according to his capacity. And our success is only by God Almighty. Let no reader of this book of ours be terrified by this action, recoiling in retreat, fleeing in panic, turning back his reins from this mountain pass. For we speak a word supported by proof, and we judge a case backed by eyewitness: Indeed, there are people whose minds were too weak to understand the Quran, so they approached it with unjust desires, occupied thoughts, and tainted understandings. They did not delay in deviating from the path and swerving from the truth. Among them are those who deem the blood of the Ummah permissible, those who yearn for some paths of disbelief, and those who say about God Almighty what He did not say. God Almighty repeated His revelation and speech, saying: {He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not thereby except the defiantly disobedient} (2 Al-Baqarah: 26). And so it is with everyone who approaches a thing improperly, or is incapable of it. And we seek help from God Almighty. Let him who reads this book of ours know that the benefit of these books is not in one science only, but in every science. Their benefit in the Book of God Almighty, the Hadith of His Prophet, peace be upon him, and in giving Fatwa (legal rulings) regarding the Halal (lawful) and Haram (unlawful), the obligatory and the permissible, is of the greatest benefit. The summary of that is in understanding the things which God Almighty and His Messenger, peace be upon him, stipulated, the meanings contained therein upon which rulings apply, the named things that fall outside of them, and their categorization under the rulings according to that...",

    "text": "Perhaps Al-Nashi' was among those who drew Ibn Hazm's attention to researching the issue of the Names of God Almighty, because Al-Nashi' used to say: The names are \"literal regarding the Creator, metaphorical regarding the created\" (1). 5 - Ibn Hazm's Methodology in Al-Taqrib: The Muslim logicians inherited from the Scholastics and Alexandrian commentators and others the arrangement of the Aristotelian logical books into eight. This is what Al-Farabi clarified sufficiently in a detailed text quoted by Ibn Abi Usaibia (2). He named the first book \"Categories\" (Qatighuriyas), the second \"Interpretation\" (Peri Hermeneias), the third \"Syllogism\" or First Analytics, the fourth \"Demonstration\" or Second Analytics, the fifth \"Dialectical Topics\" or Topica, the sixth \"Sophistical Wisdom\" or Sophistica, the seventh \"Rhetoric\", and the eighth \"Poetry\" or Poetics. Al-Farabi said: And the fourth part is the most advanced of them in honor and leadership; logic is sought primarily for the fourth part, and the rest of its parts are only borne for the sake of the fourth. Ibn Hazm followed this division, in an approximate manner. He presented before the eight books a discussion on the Introduction or Isagoge. Then he addressed the books of Aristotle; he named the first \"Singular Names,\" and the second \"The Book of Reports\"—which is what Al-Farabi called \"Interpretation.\" He incorporated the following four books (3, 4, 5, 6) into one chapter and collected them under the name \"Demonstration\" (Burhan), rejecting the name \"Syllogism\" (Qiyas). Despite his belief that \"Demonstration\" is the ultimate goal, he did not distinguish \"Second Analytics\" distinctly. He scattered the discussion on Sophistry across several places. Shortly before the end of this chapter, he discussed the rank of argumentation and the etiquette of debate (Paragraph: 18). Then he followed this paragraph with another (Number: 19) in which he discussed taking premises from sciences, dividing them into twelve sciences, stating that he does not adhere in this division to what the predecessors followed. After that, he wrote two small chapters in which he applied judgments of his own on Rhetoric and Poetry and did not stop at any of Aristotle's opinions. He divided the whole book into two volumes (Safers). He stopped at the end of the first volume at the end of Categorical Propositions. He began the second volume by mentioning Conditional Propositions without this division having any relation to the nature...\n\n...and words whose phrasing differs but whose meanings agree. Let the knowledgeable know that whoever does not understand this amount has become distant from understanding his Lord, the Exalted, and the Prophet, peace be upon him. It is not permissible for him to issue a Fatwa between two people due to his ignorance of the definitions of speech, the construction of some of it upon others, the presentation of premises, and their production of conclusions by which proof stands and which are always true, or distinguishing them from premises that are true once and false another time and cannot be relied upon. As for the science of looking into opinions, religions, desires, and articles of faith, its practitioner cannot do without understanding the meanings of these books, due to what we will explain of its chapters, God Almighty willing. The summary of that is knowing what stands by itself and what does not stand by itself, the subject and the predicate, the modes of predication in rioting (sophistry) and adherence, and other than that. As for the science of Grammar, Language, History (News), distinguishing its truth from its falsehood, Poetry, Rhetoric, and Prosody [5v], it [logic] has in all of that intense usage, subtle entry, frequent recurrence, and apparent benefit. As for Medicine, Geometry, and Astronomy, their people also cannot do without it for verifying divisions and escaping the three shared things and other matters, for which this book of ours is not the place to mention. These are sentences that will be evident to anyone who reads these books, becomes skilled in them, exercises with them, and then looks into any of the sciences we mentioned; he will find what we said to be true, and their landmarks will appear to him in their mountain passes and obscurities, revealing to him all that was hidden. And success is by God Almighty. This book of ours falls under the types in which people of knowledge and correct discrimination do not compose except therein, under the fourth type, which is the explanation of the obscure; this is the fourth rank of the ranks of honor in compositions. We will not fail, God willing, to include in it the clarification of correcting a corrupt opinion in which many people are about to err, alerting to an obscure matter, summarizing what the seeker of truths has no necessity for, and collecting scattered things while being comprehensive of everything for which the seeker of proof has the slightest need, abandoning deletion from that entirely. The types we mentioned are seven, with no eighth: They are either something we were not preceded in extracting, so we extract it; or something incomplete, so we complete it; or something mistaken, so we correct it; or something obscure, so we explain it; or something long, so we summarize it, without deleting from it anything whose deletion would harm its purpose...",

    "text": "...of the subject; perhaps he only considered the size of the book itself. He mentioned in one place in his book (1) that he built it upon brevity, but in reality, he gave free rein to himself whenever he found the subject before him allowing for expansion, especially in behavioral aspects, etiquette of interaction, doctrinal matters, and the like. If we examine *Al-Taqrib* closely, we do not find an explanation of Aristotle's opinions as written on the first page, but rather it is mostly a simplification of the closest opinions. Furthermore, a fleeting comparison between what Ibn Hazm wrote about Demonstration (Burhan) and what Ibn Sina wrote in his book *Al-Burhan* indicates something regarding the distance or closeness of the emulation to the Aristotelian original. From other comparisons, we see Ibn Hazm standing alone with logical ambition in many places. The text that Al-Farabi mentioned regarding the names of the eight books themselves is itself proof of that. 6 - Value of the Book: Ibn Hazm did not claim for himself any innovation in Logic; rather, he stated that this book of his falls under the fourth type of compositions, which is the type that deals with explaining the obscure: \"We will not fail, God willing, to include in it the clarification of correcting a corrupt opinion in which many people are about to err, alerting to an obscure matter, scorning what the seeker of truths has no necessity for, and collecting scattered things while being comprehensive of everything for which the seeker of proof has the slightest need\" (2). Ibn Hazm was accused—as previously mentioned—of disagreeing with Aristotle in some of his principles, the disagreement of one who did not understand his purpose nor had exercised himself in his book. Proving this disagreement is something this introduction does not have room for, nor do circumstances allow, but it is a disagreement that is not unlikely for several reasons, including: 1 - Ibn Hazm moved beyond representing with letters and symbols to extracting examples from the familiarities of life and Sharia; hence, error easily enters, and disagreement arises. 2 - He proceeded in his concepts from religious premises that Aristotle did not have, and his passion for bringing Logic and Sharia closer might lead him into illusion or impossibility. 3 - He applied his Zahiri (literalist) view in many matters, so he denied Qiyas (analogy) and denied causality in Sharia matters, and elaborated on explaining rational knowledge, while weakening the value of induction, even though...\n\n...or something scattered, so we collect it; or something disordered, so we arrange it. Then authors vary in merit regarding what they suffered in their compositions of what we mentioned, according to the extent of their comprehension of what they intended, or some fall short of others. For each is a share of excellence, virtue, thanks, and reward, even if he only spoke on a single issue, provided he does not go outside the types we mentioned in whatever science he authored. As for one who takes the composition of another and repeats it as it is, moving things forward and backward without improving its order, or changes its words without bringing simpler and clearer ones, or deletes what is needed, or brings what is [not] needed, or refutes a truth with an error, and brings what has no benefit—these are but the actions of the people of ignorance, heedlessness, impudence, and silliness; we seek refuge in God from that. [Introduction to Logic or Isagoge] This is when we begin, God Almighty willing, by His power and strength, in what we intended, so we proceed to explain the Introduction to the mentioned books, which is called in the Greek language *Isagoge*. The meaning of *Isagoge* in the Greek language is \"The Introduction,\" and it is specifically authored by Porphyry of Tyre. The books following it are authored by Aristotle, the teacher of Alexander and the administrator of his kingdom. Success is by God Almighty, and to Him we hold fast and are supported; there is no god but He. 1 - Discourse on the Division of Heard Sounds [6r] All sounds apparent from those making sound are divided into two parts: Either they indicate a meaning, or they do not indicate a meaning. That which does not indicate a meaning, there is no reason to busy oneself with it because no benefit we can understand is obtained from it; and seeking what has this description is not of the actions of people of intellect. This is like every sound you heard and did not know what it was. Included in this also is the apparent speech of those with pleurisy (delirium) and madmen and whoever follows their course. If a sayer says: \"But this speech you mentioned indicates that its speaker does not reason or that he is sick\"; it is said to him, and success is by God Almighty: It indicates that to you [by] its implication. However, when it departed from the speech of people of discrimination, it was like a sign of an affliction in its owner. Also, such speech may appear from a narrator or a jester, so it does not indicate that its owner does not reason. Thus, what he objected with is not...",

Ibn Hazm was not alone in his attempt to approximate Logic by multiplying Sharia examples, but he was perhaps the first to open this door, just as Ibn Sina tried to derive examples from medicine, and later Al-Ghazali came and returned to deriving examples from Fiqh. Thus, the book *Al-Taqrib* proves that Al-Ghazali was preceded in this attempt. From the beginning, religious thinkers stood in two groups regarding the logic of the First Teacher. A group tried to be independent of it and created what can be called \"The Logic of the Theologians\" (Mantiq al-Mutakallimin), and another group supported Aristotelian Logic. With this book, Ibn Hazm stands in the second group with Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Al-Ghazali, while on the opposite side of them stand Al-Nashi', Al-Nawbakhti, Al-Baqillani, and Ibn Taymiyyah. It is interesting for one to compare two who are extremely close in doctrinal school, like Ibn Hazm and Ibn Taymiyyah, while they stand on far opposite sides in their view of Logic. Whatever the case, the book *Al-Taqrib* is an important link in the history of Islamic philosophical thought in general and in the history of Andalusian thought in particular. In it, if we bypass the logical aspects, are important truths touching the nature of intellectual life in Andalusia, and some of it relates to the personality of Ibn Hazm himself and his view on life and people. There is no doubt that it opens new horizons for researchers in the study of logical terminology, in what Ibn Hazm disagreed with Aristotle on, and establishes comparisons between him and Al-Ghazali, Ibn Taymiyyah, and others within the scope of the attempt he undertook. It also points to the origin which Ibn Mada' was inspired by in *The Refutation of the Grammarians* and the denial of grammatical causes. - 7 Investigation of Al-Taqrib: I relied in it on a unique copy for which I know no second, which is a copy preserved in the Ahmadiyya Library at the Zaytuna Mosque in Tunis, number: 6814. It is among the manuscripts brought by the Institute of Manuscripts at the Arab League, film number: 8. My thanks go to those in charge of it for allowing me to photograph it.\n\n...a valid objection. This science is only intended for what is truth, and distinguishing it from what might be truth and might not be. Then we return and say that the sound which indicates a meaning is divided into two parts: Either it indicates by nature, or it indicates by intent. That which indicates by nature is like the sound of the rooster which indicates, mostly, the dawn (magic hour); and like the sounds of birds indicating similar things; and like the sounds of storks, ducks, geese, and dogs at night indicating, mostly, that they saw a person; and like the sounds of cats in calling their young, their questioning, when seeking mating, and during fighting; and every sound that indicates by its nature its source, like crashing and the tapping of copper and similar sounds of animals other than humans. These only indicate all that we mentioned by the familiar habit of what accompanies those sounds, not that we understand from them what we communicate among ourselves in the languages agreed upon among nations, by which we conduct all our intentions. These sounds we mentioned, we did not intend them in this book of ours, as no instruction in knowledge, learning of a craft, or benefit of a news report is derived from them. As for the sound which indicates by intent, it is the speech with which people converse among themselves and correspond with scripts expressing it in their books to convey what has settled in their souls from one to another. These are what the Philosopher expressed by naming them \"The Logical Indicative Sounds.\" If a rioter riots using what appears from some non-rational animals of understood speech, like what the starling, parrot, and magpie learn of mimicking speech in which an existing meaning is known, that is not correct [as logic], nor is the understanding of a meaning intended by it. It is not counted among what is known, nor does he [the animal] place it in its place, but repeats it just as he repeats the rest of his chirping as he was accustomed. It is in the nature of many animals to make sounds with certain letters in a certain order, and all of that is contrary to the speech of humans [6v] by which they express types of sciences, crafts, news, and all intentions. Then we return and say: This section which we mentioned indicates by intent is divided into two parts:",

    "text": "The manuscript consists of ninety-two folios, with 26 lines on each page and an average of 11 words per line. It is written in a precise Naskh script—or of medium precision—and many words lack diacritical points. Among its most prominent features is that the scribe places the letter \"Ta\" (ط) over a word to indicate its deletion or omission. He establishes the \"Ya\" (ي) in the nominative state [for indefinite defective nouns] in words such as: *Mutanāhī* (finite), *Tālī* (consequent), *Wāhī* (flimsy), and so on. I have deleted this \"Ya\" wherever it occurred and indicated some of that—not all—in the footnotes by way of example. Furthermore, the scribe does not adhere to the rule of reversing the gender of the single number with the counted noun; for example, he writes: \"Six [feminine] legs [feminine],\" and I have taken the liberty of changing this as well. There are no marginal notes on the copy except for some corrections and two or three comments. The copy is not dated, but its script may indicate that it was perhaps written in the seventh century [AH] or slightly before. I have exerted my effort in correcting it, but I was not able to solve every problem I encountered (1), despite prolonged consideration and repeated attempts. I hope that God will make this book beneficial through His grace and generosity. Beirut, July 10, 1959. Ihsan Abbas.\n\nIt either indicates a single person (individual) or it indicates more than one person. As for that which indicates a single person, it is like our saying: Zayd, Amr, the Commander of the Faithful, the Minister, this horse, Khalid's donkey, and the like. These only give us, when we hear the speaker pronounce them, the specific person the speaker intended alone; we do not benefit more than that from it. This is not what we intended to discuss, because the definition of these names is not governed by their name due to a difference we will mention after this, God willing. Know that every collective entity in the world has many parts like it in the world, except that some are distinct from others. We call it an \"individual\" (Shakhs) by agreement among us, such as the single man, the single dog, the single mountain, the whiteness of a single garment, the single movement, and everything else that stands alone from another. So if you hear us mention \"the individual\" and \"the individuals,\" this is what we want. As for the second section: It is that which indicates more than one, such as our saying: People, horses, donkeys, garments, colors, and the like. For every word among what we mentioned, when we say it, indicates very many individuals. Standing in the place of these words in the Arabic language are also nouns that apply to the group, as we mentioned, but also apply to the single one, except that the condition of the speaker clarifies his intent. Like your saying: \"The Human\" (Al-Insan); this word indicates the whole species, as in the saying of God Almighty: {Indeed, mankind is in loss} (103 Al-Asr: 2). He meant the collective children of Adam, peace be upon him. This word also applies to a single one, so you say: \"Are you coming to the human (al-insan) you know?\" while you mean his servant, his wife, or a specific one among people. Likewise in all species, you say \"The Horse\" and mean every horse. Do you not see that you say: \"The horse is neighing\" [meaning the species], or you say \"The horse\" referring to a specific, familiar horse? So if you wanted to remove ambiguity, you would use the plural form assigned to it, saying: \"The horses\" or \"The people\" and the like. This section is what we intended to discuss. Because it applies to a group, we needed to clarify it, and we spoke about it—not the other sections we mentioned before—due to the extreme need to define every single individual under this word with attributes found in all of them...",

For you are able to bring attributes found in everything named \"camel,\" from which it is never devoid, and which are not found at all [7r] in anyone named Zayd. This is the difference we promised to mention just now. Necessity also called for seeking these differences due to the variation of names in Arabic and foreign languages; so we needed to estimate the attributes by which the named things are distinguished, since meanings in all languages are one and do not differ, whereas only the names differ. Also, language might be too narrow to assign a unique name to every type, or perhaps that was not prepared for people by agreement, or God Almighty knows best about it. Most of this is in \"Qualities\" (Kayfiyyat); for you find the yellowness of the narcissus is yellow, the yellowness of the sun is yellow, the yellowness of the gillyflower is yellow, and the yellowness of gold is yellow. All of these are visibly distinct to the eye, yet not every one of them has a specific name clarifying our intent regarding it. Likewise, many types of animals, such as those generated in stagnant waters and rotting dampness, up to types of insects for which we know no specific names, yet the difference between their attributes is visible and known. Therefore, one must seek differentiating attributes by which the clarification of what we want occurs, God Almighty willing, there is no god but He. 2 - Discourse on Nouns that Apply to a Group or Individuals: We looked at the section we intended to discuss and found it to be two parts: One of them indicates the group of individuals with an indication that never separates from them, and is not removed from them except by their corruption. This section the philosopher named \"Essential\" (Dhati) and likened it to a part of the parts of what it is in, due to its adherence to it. We say it is more adherent to what it is in than the part is to the rest of its parts. For the part may go away while the rest of the parts remain as they are, like the hand of a human may fall off while he remains a human as he was. But this term [Essential], if the attributes for which the named thing deserved to be called by this name go away, the named thing is nullified entirely, as we will explain after this, God Almighty willing. The second part indicates a group of individuals with an indication that may separate from what it is in, or its separation is imagined without it being corrupted by its separation. This section the philosopher named \"Accidental\" (Ghayri) due to the evidence we mentioned regarding it. Then we looked at the first section which we said is called \"Essential,\" and found it divided into three parts:",

    "text": "Either it is a word by which many individuals, differing in their individuals and their species, are named, and it answers one who asks saying: \"What is this thing?\" So we agreed to name that word a \"Genus\" (Jins). Or it is a word by which many individuals, differing in their individuals not in their species, are named, and it answers one who asks saying: \"What is this from the group that was named?\" So we agreed to name this word [missing text: likely \"Species\" (Naw')]. Or it is named for many individuals whose species and individuals differ, except that it answers one who asks saying: \"Which thing is this from the group that was named?\" [7v] So we agreed to name this a \"Difference\" (Fasl). The interpretation of these meanings will come after this, God Almighty willing. These three sections are Essentials (Dhatiyyat) as we presented. The explanation of that is that you say: \"What is this?\" It is said to you: \"A body.\" You say: \"Which of the bodies is it?\" It is said: \"Growing.\" It is said: \"Which of the growing things is it?\" It is said to you: \"Possessor of fronds, leaves, branches, tall, and the fruit named dates.\" So Body is a Genus; Growing is a Species; and your saying \"Possessor of fronds, leaves, and branches\" is a Difference. If you drop the attributes we mentioned, for which those individuals deserved to be named by the names we mentioned, and you imagined their meanings to be nonexistent, those names would fall from them entirely; for this reason, they were called Essential. Then we looked at the second section which we mentioned is named \"Accidental,\" and we found it divided into two parts: Either a word indicating things different in their species in answer to \"Which?\", so it is a \"General Accident\" ('Arad 'Amm). Or a word indicating things different in their individuals in answer to \"Which?\", so it is a \"Specific Accident\" or \"Property\" ('Arad Khass). Know that the Arabic language did not enable expression in it with more than what you see. However, asking with \"Ma\" (What) and asking with \"Ayy\" (Which) may be equivalent in the Arabic language, and each of these two words substitutes for the other and occurs with one meaning. Whoever has mastered the Latin language knows the distinction between the two meanings we intended in the interrogation, for it has a word for interrogation about the general different from the word for interrogation about the parts of that general, with a clarity that is not confused for its speaker at all.",

    "text": "3 - Discourse on Interpreting Words Included in the Chapter Before This One Which We Begin With: We mentioned in the chapter before this things that differ in their species and individuals, and things that differ in their individuals only without their species. An example of that is that we say regarding the Essential: \"Animal,\" so it indicates to us the human, the horse, and others. These are things that differ in species and individuals together; for the human differs from the horse in his person in that he is other than it, and differs also in the attributes of his person. We say: Zayd's horse and Amr's horse; these two differ only in person—meaning this one versus that one—otherwise, this is a horse and that is a horse, agreeing in the attributes by which each of them deserved to be named a horse. Likewise, the dinar and the dinar, the dirham and the dirham, and so on with other things. Similarly, we say regarding the Accidental: White and White; we mean the human is white and the wall is white. These are all different in their species in that each one is other than the other. They also differ in their attributes in that one is flesh and blood, the second is woven linen, and the third [8r] is dust, water, and plaster. And we say \"Laughing\" and \"Laughing\"; they differ only in person in that this is other than that. As for the rest of the attributes by which they deserved the name of Humanity, they are agreed therein. This summary is sufficient to dispel most of the cloudiness in ignorance of what is meant by this word presented before. Much interpretation remains which will come after this, God Almighty willing. 4 - Discourse on Definition (Hadd), Description/Sketch (Rasm), the Totality of Existents, and the Interpretation of Subject and Predicate: This is a chapter that should be mastered thoroughly, for it is like the key to what comes after this, God Almighty willing. Know that there is no existent at all, nor any reality whatsoever, except the Creator and His creation only; there is no way to a third at all. The Creator is One, First, Eternal. As for the creation, it is many. Then we say: As for creation, it is divided into two parts with no third at all: A thing that stands by itself and carries another, so we agreed to name it \"Substance\" (Jawhar); and a thing that does not stand by itself and must...",

The Accident is its length, its width, its color, its movement, its shape, and all its attributes carried in the body. For you see the unripened date (1) green, then it becomes red, then it becomes yellow; and the red is other than the green and other than the yellow. The essence (source) upon which (2) these colors alternate is one, then it transforms and becomes another body. Likewise, you see gold as dust (3), then it becomes an ingot, then it becomes a minted dinar, and the body in all of that is itself. Likewise, you see the human lying down, then bowing, standing, then sitting, and he is in all of that one, not exchanged, while his accidents are exchanged and changing; an attribute goes and [an attribute] occurs. It is necessary for everything we mentioned of the two parts of creation to have attributes carried in it, or a meaning existing for it, by which it is distinguished from others, and due to which the difference between names becomes necessary. As for the Creator, Mighty and Majestic, He is neither a carrier nor carried in any way whatsoever; we have mastered this meaning in a place other than this, and praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, for guiding us. Then we return and say: The attributes or meanings which we mentioned are necessary for everything other than the Creator Almighty are divided into two parts: Either indicating the nature of what it is in, distinguishing it from others, so we agreed to name it \"Definition\" (Hadd); or distinguishing it from others while not indicating a nature, so we agreed to name it \"Description\" or \"Sketch\" (Rasm). We say: Disputing (4) over names is meaningless; only people of prattle, foolishness, and ignorance busy themselves with that. Our purpose from them is only the distinction between named things, and what achieves understanding between one another. God Almighty sent messengers with various languages, while the intended meaning is one [8v]. So it is established that the purpose is only mutual understanding. Everything other than the Creator Almighty must necessarily be described (marsum) and defined (mahdud) (5), because there must exist for it a meaning by which...",

    "text": "...its nature is distinguished from others, whether it is an accident or a substance. The predecessors named the noun in this place \"Subject\" (Mawdu'). So if you hear them say \"The Subject,\" they only mean the noun intended to be clarified by description or definition. Every defined thing is described, but not every described thing is defined, because every definition is a distinction of the defined from others, and every description is a distinction of the described from others. Thus, every definition is a description [in the sense of distinction], but not every description distinguishes the nature of the described or clarifies it; and every definition distinguishes the nature of the defined and separates it. So not every description is a definition; thus, the description is more general than the definition. The Sheikh said: This is the phrasing of the translators, and it contains confusion because they asserted that the Description (Rasm) is not taken from genera and differences (differentia), and that it is only taken from accidents and properties. Then they did not delay in contradicting themselves, saying: \"Every definition is a description,\" thereby necessitating that the definition is taken from accidents, or that some description is taken from differences; this is the opposite of what they said before. Also, they said: Description is other than Definition, then they asserted that Definition is a part of Description; this is a contradiction as you see. But the correct view is to say: Every discriminator of one thing from another is either a discrimination found from genera and species, so it is a Definition indicating the nature of the thing, distinguishing it from others; or it is distinguished by a discrimination found from accidents or properties, so it is a discriminator of the thing from others only, not indicating its nature. Thus, the Discrimination is a comprehensive head, divided into two types: either Definition or Description. So Description is divided into two parts: a part that distinguishes the nature of the described, which is Description and Definition; and a part that does not distinguish it, so it is Description not Definition. The Ancients expressed the Definition as: \"A brief statement indicating the nature of the Subject, distinguishing it from others,\" and the Description as: \"A brief statement distinguishing the Subject from others.\" The Definition is predicated on the Defined, and the Description is predicated on the Described, because each of them is attributes of what it is in. So if the distinction is taken from the genus of the thing intended to be distinguished and from its differences, it is a Definition and a mark (Sīma); and if it is taken from its properties and accidents, it is a Description, not a Definition. This is merely a clarification of the meaning of the word 'Definition' and the word 'Description,' not that the Definition needs a definition; if that were so, it would necessitate the existence of infinite definitions, and this is impossible, absurd, and false.

Both are of no concern, because they deny observation; and praise be to God. We have explained that the Definition is merely certain attributes certain to exist in some things and certain to be absent in other things, describing each by what is in it. Whoever denies this has denied sense and eyewitness and has exited the boundary of those we engage with. The Definition is like our saying regarding the Human: He is the body capable of color, possessor of the rational soul, living, dying. \"Living\" is a genus for the soul, whatever soul it is; and the rest of what we mentioned are differences (differentia) for it from other animal souls. This is the Definition as you see. The Description (Rasm) is like your saying (1) regarding the Human: He is the laugher or the weeper. It is, as you see, distinguishing the human from others, but not indicating his nature which is the acceptance of life and death. The Definition clarifies that. The rule of the Definition is that it must be equal to the Defined. The meaning of that is that its wording, when mentioned, necessitates all that is intended, so nothing of what you wanted to define deviates from it, nor does anything that is not of it enter into it. If you add a word to the Definition, and the word you added applies to more meanings than the meanings of the Defined or meanings equal to it, the Defined remains as it is. Like our saying in the definition of the human soul: It is living, rational, dying, a substance, sensing, laughing, weeping, shining in a body accepting color, upright in stature, and the like. The Defined up to now is correct in rank because every soul of every human has these attributes. But if the word you added necessitates fewer meanings than the meanings of the Defined, that is a decrease from the Defined. Like your saying regarding the human soul: It is living, rational, dying, weaving; or you say: practicing medicine or writing. For this is only a definition for some human souls, not all of them, since not every human is a writer, a doctor, or a weaver. However, if you decrease from the Definition that has no excess—meaning no increase in it over the amount of sufficiency in the definition—it is an increase in the Defined. Like your saying regarding the Human: It is living, rational. For the angel and the jinn enter under this definition.

Whatever is Essential among attributes—as we presented—it is said of it: This is an \"Essential Predication\" (Haml Jawhari); and whatever is Accidental, it is said: This is an \"Accidental Predication\" (Haml 'Aradi). All of this is convention regarding simple words under which many meanings are gathered, to approximate understanding. If you say: \"Zayd is departing,\" Zayd is the Subject, and departing is the Predicate upon Zayd, meaning it is a description of him. The grammarians call this the Inchoative (Mubtada') and the Enunciative (Khabar) if it comes in this order. So if you hear \"The Subject\" and \"The Predicate,\" you only intend the Reported About and the Report About It, so know this. Discourse on Genus: The Ancients mentioned a division in Genus that has no meaning, which is: Like Tamim for Banu Tamim, Basra for its people, Ministry for every minister [9v], and Craft for its people. This is unrestricted... so there is no reason to busy oneself with it. We only intend by our speech the Genus we mentioned first, which is: The comprehensive word for two types of creatures or more. It does not indicate a specific single person like Zayd and Amr, nor a group varying only in their individuals like saying: The people, or like saying The camels, or like your saying The tribe. Rather, [it indicates] a group varying in their individuals and their species, like your saying \"The Living\" (Al-Hayy), which indicates horses, humans, angels, and every living thing. The Genus being discussed applies not to some of what its definition necessitates, but to everything to which the definition applies. The Genus does not separate from what is named by it except by the corruption and impossibility of the named. That is like your saying \"Substance\"; for this word names everything standing by itself carrying another. It is not possible to find a thing standing by itself carrying another that is not named a substance, nor is it possible to find a substance that is not standing by itself carrying another. If you imagined this thing not standing by itself, it would cease to be named a substance. As for the town, a human may move from it to another and remain a human as he was. Likewise for the plan, the craft, and the trade. As for Banu Tamim, we may find many people who are not from Banu Tamim, so none of these aspects is a Genus.",

    "text": "6 - Discourse on Species: The Ancients named the Species in some places by another name, which is \"Form\" (Surah). I see this as following the Greek language, for perhaps this name among them—I mean that which is translated into Arabic as \"Form\"—applies to the Absolute Species. There is no meaning in busying ourselves with this as there is no benefit in it. We only intend to name by it every group agreeing in their definition or description (sketch) and differing only in their individuals, like your saying: Angels, humans, jinn, stars, palm trees, apples, locusts, blackness, whiteness, standing, sitting, and all that resembles this. The Species falls under the Genus because it is a part of it. A Genus may gather many Species, such that its name—we mean the name of the Genus—applies to every Species among them, and its definition is found in all of them, while they vary beneath it by attributes specific to each Species to the exclusion of the other. That is, you say: \"Living/Animal\" (Hayy), and under this naming fall humans, horses, mules, lions, and other animals. If you define \"Living,\" saying: \"It is the sensing, moving by will,\" this definition is also comprehensive of all that we mentioned and found in all of them. Yet, every Species we mentioned is distinguished by an attribute excluding the rest, such as speech (reason), neighing, braying, roaring, and so on. So \"Living\" is a Genus, and all that we mentioned are Species under it; meaning \"Living\" gathers them, and they are its parts, and they differ under it as we presented [10r]. Here is a wondrous rank: The starting point in the division of the world is a Genus that is never a Species, such as \"Substance\" (Jawhar); for stones, trees, plants, and animals are named by it; all of that, from first to last, is Substance. Substance is a principle (Mabda') above which there is no Genus such that its name applies to Substance and non-Substance. And the stopping point (Waqf) in the division of the world is a Species that is never a Genus, such as humans, horses, tigers, rubies, grapes, and what resembles that. For under each of these names, there are only its individuals, such as Zayd, Amr, and Hind; every horse individually; every ruby individually; and every grape individually. Do not consider descriptions that gather some humans and not others—such as blacks, whites, flat-nosed, tall, and short—to be species; likewise in every species, these are merely varieties (Asnaf) and divisions. The nature in every one of them is one, and the definition of every one of them is one, comprehensive of them all. The definition of Species is not like that; rather, every Species has a separate definition that no other Species shares with it...",

    "text": "...at all. Between the two extremes are things that are both Species and Genus, such as \"Growing\" (Nami). It is a Species of Substance, because Substance [can be] growing and non-growing. And \"Growing\" is also a Genus for that which has a living, dying soul, and for that which does not have a soul, because trees, plants, the human body, and other animals capable of death are all growing things, and the name \"Growing\" applies to all of them and encompasses them. The Ancients agreed to name the first Genus \"Genus of Genera\" (Summum Genus)—meaning that above which there is no Genus, and which is never a Species at all. They agreed to name the other Species \"Species of Species\" (Infima Species), which is the one regarding which we said there is a stop, and it is never a Genus at all, and there is no Species below it, and nothing is below it except its individuals only. This Species is the one expressed as being adjacent to the individuals. As for the rest of the Species we mentioned that are between the two extremes, being both Species and Genera, they are not adjacent to the individuals in rank, because between them and the individuals are other Species. Like your saying: \"People\" (Humans); this word is between your saying \"Living\" and: Zayd and Amr. Thus, it has become clear, and praise be to God, that the Genus is divided into two parts: A Genus that is not a Species, which is the Principle—I mean Substance; and a Genus that may be a Species. And it has become clear that the Species is divided into two parts: A Species that is not a Genus, which is the stopping point in division, like individuals of humans or horses; and a Species that may be a Genus. The latter falls into three sections: One section is Pure Genus, the second section is Pure Species, and the third section is Genus from one aspect and Species from another aspect. It is a Genus for what is below it because it is generalized by it. Some expressed this by saying it is only a Species for what is below it, meaning gathering it, and no one expressed it by saying it is a Genus [10v] for what is above it. I only mentioned this to you so you do not see it and become confused. The correct view is what we mentioned first: that it is a Species for the Genera above it, and a Genus for the Species below it. Because if you attribute it to what is above it, it is better to call it by a name other than what you call it when attributing it to what is below it, so that the difference between its two attributions becomes apparent. As for the Species of Species which we mentioned, it is not permissible to call it a Genus at all, because Genus is only applied to what gathers two Species or more, not that which is adjacent to individuals only.",

    "text": "7 - A Comprehensive Chapter on Genera and Species: Genera of Genera which are never Species at all, and are the primaries in the division of the world: The predecessors mentioned that they are ten, then they verified and said: The principles among them are four. The ten are: Substance (Jawhar), Quantity (Kam), Quality (Kayf), Relation (Idafah), Time (Mata), Place (Ayn), Posture (Nasbah), State/Possession (Milk), Action (Fa'il), and Affection (Munfa'il). The four which they verified as the heads of principles and primaries of division are: Substance, Quantity, Quality, and Relation. As for the remaining six, they are composites of the mentioned four, that is, from joining some of them to others as will occur in their chapters, God Almighty willing. Know that Substance alone—among the names we mentioned—stands by itself and carries the rest. The remaining nine are predicated in the Substance, are accidents to it, and do not stand by themselves. If a speaker says: \"Why did you not make 'Thing' (Shay'), 'Existent' (Mawjud), 'Established' (Muthbat), or 'Truth' (Haqq) a comprehensive Genus for these ten names, because all of them are existent, established, true, and a thing?\" It is said to him, and success is by God Almighty: We have already presented that the Genus provides the definition of everything under it. Nature is a power in the thing by which its qualities exist as they are. So whatever does not inform about the nature of what is under its name is not a Genus. Since the words 'thing', 'existent', 'established', and 'truth' do not inform about the nature of all they apply to, and contain nothing more than that it is not false or non-existent only, it became necessary that none of these words be a Genus for what is named by them. As for the word 'Known' (Ma'lum), it may apply to the existent and the non-existent, the truth and the falsehood, because falsehood is known to be falsehood, and the non-existent is known to be non-existent; so it is also not a Genus according to what we presented, and because it would necessitate that falsehood and truth be under one Genus, which is a heinous impossibility. Furthermore, our existence of some of these Heads is contrary to our existence of the rest [11r]. Some of them the soul finds through the four senses which convey the attributes of their sensible objects to the sensing soul, not standing by themselves. Some of them the soul finds by pure intellect, not standing by themselves, like the existence of Number, Time, and Relation. Some of them the soul finds through the mediation of both senses and intellect together, not standing by themselves, like Movements. And some of them the soul finds through the mediation of intellect and senses together...",

And the soul may find by pure intellect—graduating from the existence of these ten—knowledge of What is truly existent, not described by any of the attributes of these ten, Who is the First, One Creator, Eternal, there is no god but He. For everything that falls under one Genus, its existence is only upon one attribute comprehensive of its collection—meaning a single definition exists gathering everything under the Genus—or by a single property gathering everything under the Genus, as we will explain in the chapter of each Head of the mentioned ten. The properties of the verified Heads among these ten are different, so it was necessary that they not all be under one Genus. Thus, it was necessary that 'Existent' never be a Genus for these ten. The statement regarding 'Established' is like the statement regarding 'Existent', with no difference. As for the words 'Truth' and 'Thing': Some of these ten are true by themselves, which is Substance; likewise, it is also a thing by itself. The rest of them are true by other than themselves and things by other than themselves, because they were realized through the Substance, and by it (1) they became things. Were it not for the Substance, they would not be truth nor things. Everything that falls under a Genus has one nature, not different ones. These things have different natures as you see, so it was necessary that 'Truth' and 'Thing' not be a Genus for them. For applying names of Genera to what is under them is only according to their agreement in their natures, agreement in their definitions, and agreement in their differences (differentia), which necessitates the agreement of their names. And according to their difference in natures, their differences and definitions differ, so their Genera differ for that reason. Know that 'Existent', 'Truth', 'Established', and 'Thing' apply to everything they apply to as Homonyms (Equivocal Names), as we will explain in the chapter on Names for Named Things. If a speaker says: \"Why didn't you make your saying 'Accident' a Genus for the remaining nine excluding Substance?\" It is said to him, and success is by God: These nine named 'Accident' have different modes of being. The Substance's carrying of them is a different carrying; for some are carried in its person and are an accident in it, like Qualities; some are carried in its nature and are an accident in it, like Number and Time; and some are an accident to it from the direction of another, and carried in its nature by the nature of another, like Relation. We have presented that the Genus informs about the nature of what is under it. These which we mentioned have different natures in their being 'Accidents', and their descriptions differ; so the existence of [11v] 'Accident' as a Genus for them is invalid. So whoever disputes with us among the people of...",

However, we say to you two sufficient statements for one who reasons and does not desire rioting. We say: If you are determined on what you mentioned and you are a Monotheist, know that you have placed God Almighty under Genera, because He, the Exalted, is Existent, Truth, and Established. If you place Him under a Genus, you have made Him defined by necessity, since everything that falls under a Genus is defined (limited); God is exalted above that. The second statement is we say: We do not dispute with you regarding the [letters] Jim, Nun, and Sin. If it appears to you to name your hand, your foot, or your molar a \"Genus,\" there is nothing preventing you from that, except that you need someone to agree with you on conversing in this language you invented. It suffices us that you stop at your obedience regarding a name you agree with us upon, agreeing to apply it to every group gathered by a single nature from which its differences arise, and from which its definitions are found, and under which many differing in their species are found, so that we may understand our intent by it. If you refuse that and place what is other than the Creator Almighty not under definitions, then you fall into open declaration of stubbornness against intellect and senses. For you necessarily see things agreeing in one attribute, and other things differing from them in that attribute while agreeing in another attribute. This is the meaning of Definition, because every attribute defines what it is in, excluding what it is not in. No one rejects this except a madman or one who is in a worse state than a madman by intending to invalidate truths, confuse knowledge, and establish ambiguity. Whoever desires [this] here, speaking with him is abandoned, since our goal with whom we speak is that he turns to the truth or for the sake of truth, not those (1) upon whom intellectual judgments do not apply—along with the fact that this is disbelief (Kufr) from its believer, if he is among those who label themselves with faith. And in God we seek refuge from error and what leads to it. With this, we also speak to the one who says to us: \"Why didn't you call 'Species' what you called 'Genus', and call 'Genus' what you called 'Species'?\" For indeed, a fool may ask this question. Know that Substance alone, excluding the other things we mentioned, exists by itself, while the others alternate upon it.

Substance is perceived by the intellect only; it is not visible, tasted, touched, or smelled. We only see colors, so if color is absent, we see nothing, like moving air—which is wind—for it is perceived by touch and butts [12r] against great bodies knocking them down, yet it is invisible because it has no color. The Jinn are likewise; the Truthful One [the Prophet], peace be upon him, informed us from God Almighty that they see us from where we do not see them; we possess colors and they are without colors. Similarly, we do not smell a stone because it has no scent; we only smell scents according to their differences. Also, a stone is not tasted because it has no taste; tastes are only tasted according to their differences. And the tangible is only touched regarding roughness, softness, smoothness, hardness, or friability. Some Substance might be allowed/heard (1) by an accident in it as will come after this, God Almighty willing. We only placed what falls under the senses under Quality to seek brevity and to gather the many (2) under one name, and because they are all described by one description, as will occur in its chapter, God willing. Each of the Heads we mentioned gathers the nature of many things, so we named each one \"Genus of Genera.\" We also named much of what falls under each Head \"Genera\" as well, until we reach the Pure Species which are adjacent to Individuals. Know that every Higher Head—and we mean by that the Genus of Genera—and everything under it called Genus or Species: everything falling under it is named by the name of the Head which is higher than it, and we define it by its definition. For the human soul is called a substance and called living, and is described by the description of Substance and defined by the definition of Living. Likewise, the human body is called growing, a substance, and a body, and is defined and described by the description and definition of each of these names. Know that the Higher Head is not named by the name of what is below it, nor defined by its definition. The predecessors express this place by saying: \"The Higher is said of the Lower, and the Lower is not said of the Higher.\" This is only because the Lower exists in the Higher Head and others which fall under the Higher Head.

If you named the Absolute Body \"Growing,\" you would be mistaken and lying, because a stone is a Body but the stone is not Growing; this is impossible. But if you named the Growing thing a \"Body,\" you would be correct. Zayd is a human and is defined by the definition of Human; he is named Living and defined by the definition of Living; he is named a Body and described by the description of Body. But the Absolute Body is not called Living nor defined by the definition of Living, nor called Human nor defined by the definition of Human, nor called Zayd nor defined by the definition of Zayd. We mean by Absolute Body everything to which applies [the description of] every long, wide, deep thing. So the stone is a Body but not Living, nor Human, nor Zayd. The Absolute is the universal name that encompasses everything named by it. We have [12v] presented before that things and creatures are divided into three divisions: Genera, Species, and Individuals. Everything called a Genus, whether it is only a Pure Genus or constitutes a Genus and a Species, is defined with us and in Nature. That is, we begin and say: Everything other than the Creator Almighty is divided into two parts: Substance and Non-Substance. The Substance is the Body according to our view, and the Body is the Substance; and there is nothing other than the Creator Almighty except a Body or carried in a Body. Others have affirmed a substance that is not a body, and this is false. This is not the place to solve the doubts raised against us in this statement, and we have mastered it in its place. Success is by God. The discussion on this falls into Metaphysics and the Science of Tawhid (Theology), and we have established it in the book *Al-Fisal fi al-Milal wa al-Nihal*. Likewise, others described the definition of Human as \"Living, Rational, Dying.\" This definition must either mean the Composite Body alone, or the Soul alone, or the Composite Body and Soul together. If he meant the Composite Body, that is an error because he entered the Composite Body under \"Living,\" while the Living is only the Soul alone—which is the sensing, moving [entity] that if it is nullified, the sensation and movement of the body are nullified entirely. If he meant the Soul alone, that is also an error because he entered it under \"Growing,\" and the Soul is not growing; rather, the Growing is only its composite body.

The definition of the Living possessor of life is: The sensing, moving by will. The Rational Souls are the Angels, the souls of the Immortal Individuals which the Truthful One [Prophet], peace be upon him, informed us are in the Abode of Bliss—consisting of Houris and Youths—and the souls of Humans, and the souls of Jinn. Others believe, in place of the Immortal Individuals we mentioned, that the celestial bodies of stars and spheres possess living rational souls; the discussion on all this doubt has a place other than this. The Non-Rational Soul refers to the souls of other animals. The Rational Soul is divided into two parts: Rational Mortal (capable of death) and Rational Non-Mortal. The Non-Mortal are the Angels and the souls of the Immortal Individuals we mentioned. The Mortal are the souls of Humans and Jinn. The meaning of our saying \"Mortal\" is that they separate from the boundary of their vessel—the bodies composed of the four elements to which they began clinging in the world of testing—not that they become non-existent, nor that their sensation, thought, distinction, and movement are nullified at all. The Mortal is divided into two parts: Possessor of sensation [13r] accepting colors, which is the soul of Human; and possessor of a body not accepting colors, which is the soul of Jinn. As for the Non-Rational, it is described by neighing, barking, braying, and other specific attributes distinguishing its species. They are many species adjacent to individuals. As for the Non-Living, it adds to the section of Living, being divided into two parts: Composite and Non-Composite. The Non-Composite are the four elements: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth; and the nine Spheres and what is in them of planets and stars. The nine Spheres are the seven Heavens which are seven paths for the planets; the Footstool (Kursi) which is the sphere of the Mansions; and the Throne ('Arsh) which is the Universal Encompassing Sphere that rotates one rotation every day and night, above which is neither vacuum nor plenum, and which is the end of the body of the world and its existence, and there is nothing after it. The meaning of our saying Composite and Non-Composite is: The Composite is what God Almighty created from various things, like the bodies of animals and trees composed of the four elements. The meaning of our saying Non-Composite is what God Almighty created as one, not from various things; otherwise, every composite and every non-composite is composed of many parts accepting division and partitioning always.

The Not Possessor of Soul (1) are trees and plants, and they are two parts: Possessor of a trunk (stem) and Not Possessor of a trunk. Then each of these two parts divides into many species adjacent to individuals. The Possessor of Soul is divided into two parts: Possessor of a Rational Soul like the bodies of Humans and Jinn, and Possessor of a Non-Rational Soul like the bodies of other animals. The Possessor of Rational Soul is divided into two parts: Colored body, which is the body of Human; and Non-Colored body, which is the body of Jinn. The Possessor of Non-Rational Soul refers to the bodies of other animals, and they are very many species adjacent to individuals. They are defined by their specific attributes and their differences (differentia) distinguishing their natures, and by attribution to their souls. So we say: Possessor of a predatory, roaring soul; possessor of a braying soul; and the like. Thus, every species of tree and plant is defined by its differences distinguishing its natures and by attributes specific to it. This is a matter that becomes very numerous and broad; we only intended here to discuss the generalities. The Non-Growing is divided into many parts: Among them are minerals [13v] like ruby, gold, and others; and among them are woody things. They are pure Species adjacent to individuals. Each species of them is defined by its differences distinguishing its nature from others and by attributes specific to it. These Genera are limited as you see according to us, counted; and limited in themselves, counted. This is what we meant by our saying that they are limited in Nature, because we are certain that these divisions have no increase at all and that they are finite in number as we mentioned. As for everything that is a Pure Species—which are the Species adjacent to Individuals, and which we said are called Species of Species—they are limited in Nature but not limited according to us. We mean by this that the number of these species of animals, trees, plants, and stones is finite in its essence with the Creator Almighty, by a number that never increases or decreases. We are certain that there will not arise afterwards, for example, a four-legged camel that flies, nor a three-headed one; nor will horses perish until no horse is found in the world; and likewise other species.

And the Almighty said regarding that there is no increase in species (1): {And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can alter His words} (6 Al-An'am: 115). Likewise His saying Almighty: {And He taught Adam the names - all of them} (2 Al-Baqarah: 31). A second proof: All species are of a counted number with no increase in them, because the Almighty introduced Totality (Al-Kulliyyah) into them, and Totality only enters into what is finite. However, we do not encompass their numbers; we do not count the species of birds, nor the species of aquatic and land animals and other insects. Only their Creator, Mighty and Majestic, knows their number, but it is finite and counted as we presented. The proof of that is that what is infinite cannot have anything more than it, and the individuals falling under the species are more than the species. Since that is so, it is necessary that the species are not infinite; and if that is so, it is necessary that they are finite by necessity. Since we do not encompass the particulars of the Species of Species, that necessitated us to reach them through the Species that are Genera, to arrive at the knowledge of their agreement and difference. For that reason, we did not descend from the First Genera to the Pure Species. As for Individuals, they are not counted according to us nor in Nature, because we find by necessary sense that individuals of people, if there is a plague or a swift killing on a day of battle, have become very few compared to what they were yesterday. Then if growth and reproduction continue and the lands settle, the inhabited (2) almost narrows for its people due to their multitude. So they are always increasing and decreasing. The Species are not like that. Rather, they [14r] never increase nor decrease, unless the Creator wills the annihilation of what He wills of them on the Day of Resurrection in the World of Recompense; [He is] the Capable of what He wills, there is no god but He. As for Individuals, they have no number at which they stop; so it is not possible that they increase or decrease [as a fixed set], but what emerged from them into existence is limited in number, counted since God created the world until every time it is said \"Now.\" As for what has not emerged from them yet, but is among what God Almighty knew will emerge, it is limited and counted in God's knowledge, and in Nature it is countable when it emerges, not before it emerges.

    "text": "You see—by what we explained—that whenever we start from ourselves, meaning Individuals, ascending to the Genus of Genera, we start with multitude. Whenever we rise, the number decreases until we reach the Heads we mentioned. If we start from there, we only start with two parts: Substance and Non-Substance. Then the number increases in multitude until we reach the Species adjacent to Individuals. Know that Generality is not infinite, but has an end. The most general of things is your saying \"Thing\" and \"Existent\"; this is what the grammarians call the most indefinite of indefinites. Likewise, Specificity is also not infinite, but the most specific of all names below God, Blessed and Exalted, is \"I\" and \"You\"; this is the most definite of definites. Know that the Genus of Genera is a principle for what is below it, like Adam for people; the Species are like nations; and the Species of Species are like tribes—we mean they are like them only in branching off from them. Know that they said: The Genus which is the Genus of Genera is described (marsum) not defined (mahdud), because there is no Genus above it from which a definition can be taken. As for Species, they are defined. As for the divisions into which the Species of Species are divided, they are called Sections and Varieties (Asnaf). That is like the males and females of every species, or its blacks or whites, or what differs in colors among other species, or what differs in tastes among what is leveled under one species of fruits, plants, and other things that differ in an attribute while a single species gathers it all. For you find the black and white among people, and the male and female in every species of people and non-rational animals and many non-living growing things, and those of different colors among horses, chickens, and others. All of that is defined by one definition and gathered in one nature. Much of that encompasses parts of many species, like male and female, black and white. It is impossible that under one species fall different natures with opposite attributes, not all defined by a definition gathering them. Therefore, we did not make these [varieties] species gathering what is below them. We only alerted to this so an ignorant person does not say: \"These sections are different, so why didn't you make them different species?\" So we showed him that their definition is one, their nature is one, their properties are one, and their differences (differentia) are one. They only [14v] differed in accidents...",

    "text": "...only. For this reason, we did not deny dyeing copper until it returns to the likeness of the color of silver, but we denied and prevented that the nature of copper be transformed at all into the nature of silver, just as there is no way to transform the nature of a donkey into a human at all. 8 - Chapter on Difference (Differentia - Fasl): The Ancients mentioned two parts in Difference which they named: General and Specific. Their placement of them, according to us, in the chapter of discourse on Difference which we intend in Philosophy is not correct, because they fall into the chapter of discourse on the difference that does not separate species from one another under one genus. Like you saying: \"Living\" (Hayy), and the soul of the donkey is living; so which of the living do you mean? You say: \"The Rational, Mortal Living.\" So Rational and Mortal are two Differences (Differentia) separating the species of Human from the species of Donkey under the genus of Living. This is the Difference we intend, not other than it. This is what the Ancients call \"Specific of the Specific.\" We seek help from God and by Him is success: The Difference (Fasl) is what separates a nature from a nature, so it becomes clear to us by it that this is other than that entirely. If we imagined that Difference to be non-existent in what it is in, lifted from it, then what it is in would be corrupted and nullified entirely. For if you removed speech (reason) and death from the Human, he would not be a human at all, in any way. This is the difference between the Differentia (Fasl) and the Property (Khassah) as will occur after this, God Almighty willing. Therefore, this Difference was named \"Essential\" in what passed before this. By this Difference, Species stand under the Genus, separate from one another, and are distinguished from one another. Its benefit is great in every science, since some Growing things may require what others do not, and some Living things may require what the rest do not. Were it not for the Differences distinguishing every species individually, rulings, crafts, and all benefits of the world would be mixed up and would not be clear. Know that the Ancients name these \"Substantial Differences\" (Jawhariyyah) because of their adhering to what they are in, so they are like substances due to their stability. Know that Differences, Genera, and Species do not accept \"Stronger\" and \"Weaker\" (intensity), nor...",

    "text": "It applies to what it applies to only in an equal manner. It is not permissible for a human to be 'more human' than another human. We do not mean regarding bravery or manhood (virility), but we mean only regarding being a human and a person. Nor is a horse 'weaker in horseness' than another horse, nor a donkey 'stronger in donkeyness' than another donkey. And so it is with all things that are equal in a genus, species, or differentia; they are all equal within it, and one part of them does not exceed another in being that thing at all, in any way. The definition (sketch) of the Differentia (Fasl) is that you say: It is that by which species are distinguished from one another under a single genus. The differences (differentiae) exist in the species in actuality (bil-fi'l), and in the genus in potentiality (bil-quwwah). By 'in potentiality', we mean: the possibility that it exists; and by 'in actuality': that it has necessarily [15r] appeared and existed. For if you say: 'The Living' (Animal), then 'Rationality' (speech/reason) is in it in potentiality—meaning that some living things are rational. If 'Rational' were in it in actuality, then every living thing would be rational, and this is impossible. But if you say: 'The Rational Animal', then 'Rationality' is in it in actuality, meaning it has appeared and existed. The 'Nutq' (speech/reason) mentioned in this science is not speech [words], but rather the discrimination of things, thinking in sciences, crafts, neighborhoods, and the management of affairs. We have expressed all these meanings by 'Nutq' (Speech/Reason) by agreement among us. Every human is rational with the rationality we have explained, unless an accidental affliction enters his mind; otherwise, his constitution—even if he throws stones—is capable (or if that affliction were removed) of all that we mentioned. This is not the case for other animals, except Angels and Jinn, for it is not imagined that any animal other than what we mentioned understands the matters we described. As for the Differentiae, if you verify them, they are Qualities, except that they do not separate from what they are in, nor is their separation imagined except by its annulment. That meaning by which individuals came to be named species and genera is also a Quality, as we mentioned. If you find an Essential Differentia that suffices to distinguish the species you want from others, then be content with it, and there is no meaning in bringing another differentia. But if you are compelled to use many differentiae, by the sum of which the species you want to separate is isolated from others—while other things share with it in each one of them individually—then you must bring...",

    "text": "...all of them, or whatever isolates it, so that the distinction and extraction you wish to clarify is completed for you. Know that the Genus and the Species are nothing other than the Individuals; they are merely names that encompass a group of individuals that gathered and shared some of their attributes, while other individuals separated from them therein. Do not think other than this, as many ignorant people who do not know think. 9 - Chapter on the Property (Khassah): Among Properties is that which is equal (co-extensive) to the specialized subject, meaning it is in all its individuals; this is what we intend to discuss in this book. And among them is that which is more specific than the subject specialized by it, meaning it is in some of its individuals not all of them. That is like grey hair in old age, for it is in what it is in during one time and not another. And like Grammar and Poetry, for they are in actuality in some of what they are in, and in potentiality in others; for not every human is a grammarian or a poet, except that it was possible and imaginable that he be a grammarian and a poet. As for the Equal Property, it may stand in place of the Definition, and what possesses it may be described (sketched) by it with a correct description (Rasm) [15v] that revolves (is convertible) upon the two ends of its described subject. For you say: 'Every human is a rational, mortal animal', and 'Every rational, mortal animal is a human'. This is the correct Reflection (conversion), and this is the revolving upon the two ends. Meaning that nothing of what you want to describe or define deviates from it. Every human is 'laughing', either in potentiality—meaning by possibility at all times—or in actuality at some times and not others—meaning by the appearance of laughter from him. If a speaker says: 'Why did you differentiate between the Property and the Differentia?' The answer is: The Differentia is that whose non-existence from the thing it is in cannot be imagined except by the annulment of that thing. For if Reason and Death are imagined to be non-existent in a thing, that thing would not be a human at all. As for the Property, it is contrary to that. If we imagined laughter to be non-existent entirely, all at once, such that it is not known what it is, the Human would not be annulled, nor would he be prevented, due to the lack of laughter, from speaking on Grammar, Jurisprudence, and Philosophy, or from making brocade, sewing, planting, plowing, and harvesting. This is what Reason—which is discrimination—produces for him. This is a clear difference.",

    "text": "10 - Chapter on the Accident ('Arad): This, even if it is a Quality like the Differentia and the Property, has a great difference between it and them. The difference is that the Differentia is not found in other than what it differentiates at all, and the Property is likewise, not found in other than its specialized subject at all. As for the General Accident which we intend to discuss in this place, it encompasses very many species. It is divided into sections: Some of it occurs in some species and not others, then in some of its states and not others. That is like the redness of shame, the pallor of anxiety, and the depression of grief; these are very quick to vanish. And like sitting, standing, sleeping, and the like; all of these change the states of the one they are in by the change of the causes generating them, and his states are separated by them from one another. Among them is that which is slower to vanish, like the youth of a boy and the middle age of a middle-aged man and the like. And among them is that which does not vanish at all, except that if it were possible for it to vanish, nothing of the meanings of what it is in would be annulled; like the blueness of the blue-eyed, the aquiline nose of the hook-nosed, the pug nose of the snub-nosed, the blackness of the crow, and the sweetness of honey and the like. For if the Zanj (Negro) were imagined white and the crow white-footed (or white), they would not exit thereby from 'Crow-ness' nor from Humanity. Likewise, honey might be bitter and not cease to be honey. By the attributes we mentioned, some types of Accidents are separated from others. Know that in Accidents there are species, genera, and individuals, just as in Substances, as we presented before. Know that if some [16r] of the Species were imagined non-existent, the Genus would not be non-existent. Do you not see that if whiteness were non-existent, Color would not be non-existent, because blackness, greenness, redness, and others remain? Likewise, if Human were non-existent, Animal (Living) would not be non-existent, because horses, chickens, and others remain. But if the Genus were non-existent, all Species would be non-existent. This is the end of the discussion on the Introduction to the Science of Logic and the Five Terms which are: Genus, Species, Differentia, Property, and Accident. This is what the Ancients call 'Isagoge'. The first to compile it was a man named Porphyry from the people of Tyre. Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, abundantly; there is no partner with Him. There is no power or strength except in God, the High, the Great. May God bless Muhammad, His servant and messenger, and grant him peace.",

We say, and by God is success: [First Introduction]: The Names (Nouns), each of which applies to many—that is, to a group of individuals—under which their named objects fall in all languages, from first to last, occur in five ways, with no sixth. 1. Either the named thing agrees with the second named thing in its name and its definition together. Like our saying: 'Horse' and 'Horse', or our saying: 'Living' (Animal) and 'Living'. For each of these two named things agrees with the other in its name, because it is one word, and it also agrees with it in its definition, because both are sensing, moving by will; and both are neighing, sharp-eared, used for riding, with an expectation of speed in running. This type is called 'Univocal Names' (Mutawati'ah), and if you wish, you can say: 'Agreeing'. 2. The second is that the named thing differs from the named thing in its name alone [meaning they are two distinct things with different names and definitions], like our saying: 'Man' and 'Donkey'. These two are different. This type is called 'Different Names' (Mukhtalifah). 3. The third: That the named thing agrees with the named thing in its name but differs from it in its definition. Like our saying: 'Nasr' (Vulture/Eagle) for the bird that exaggerates in rising in the atmosphere and eats carrion; and our saying 'Nasr' (Frog/Hoof-part) for part of the horse's hoof; and our saying 'Nasr' (Vega/Altair) for the star...",

From this, much tribulation occurs in debate; opponents dispute and increase commotion while one intends a meaning and the other intends another meaning. This only happens between two ignorant people, or an ignorant person [16v] and a scholar, or two sophists, or a sophist and a fair person. It never happens between two fair scholars in any way. No one is safe from this except one who is distinguished in this art, supervises it, and is strong in it, for nothing of the meanings of speech is hidden from him. 4. The fourth is that the named thing agrees with the named thing in its definition, but differs from it in its name. Like our saying: 'Sinnawr', 'Daywan' (1), and 'Hirr' (synonyms for Cat). These are different words, but they all apply with a single application to every individual of the species kept in houses for hunting mice, which persists in begging when eating, and resembles the lion in its creation. This type of names is called 'Synonymous' (Mutaradifah). 5. The fifth: That the named thing differs from the named thing in its definition (2) and in its name which its species is specialized by, except that they agree in an attribute of their attributes which necessitated for them sharing in a name derived from them—either physical or psychological, whether a state or a form. The physical is like our saying: A white garment, a white bird, and a white man. For each one of these named things has a definition other than the definition of its companion, and its name in its species is other than the name of its companion, yet they all shared in that each of them is named 'White'. The psychological is like our saying: A brave lion and a brave man. This type of names is called 'Derived/Paronymous' (Mushtaqqah). These five divisions apply to Genera, Species, and varieties of Species that are like species, such as our saying: Man and Woman, Male and Female. As for the Specialized Names, they are those that apply to the essence of the named thing alone, or to every individual of a certain group. They are such that the named things have names assigned to them specific to the named thing or to certain individuals to distinguish some from others. They either agree in them or differ.

He did not intend by it the clarification of attributes gathered in the named thing to the exclusion of others, as he intended in the first [types], nor are they derived for the one named by them from an attribute in him at all. The grammarians call these 'Proper Nouns' (Al-Asma' Al-A'lam). That is like your saying: Zayd and Amr; or Zayd and Zayd; or Asad (Lion) as a man's name, or Kafur (Camphor) as his name also, and the like. These are all the divisions of Named Things under Names, and the application of all Names to Named Things; there is no addition. The Names of God Almighty, which the Text brought, are Proper Names not derived from anything at all. As for the Attributes of Action for Him, the Exalted, they are derived from His actions, like 'The Giver of Life' (Al-Muhyi) and 'The Giver of Death' (Al-Mumit) and the like. Those actions are accidents originating in His creation, not in Him; God is exalted above that [17r]. B - [Second Introduction]: Chapter on the Divisions of Speech and Its Meanings: We have explained before that speech is divided into two parts: Single and Compound. The Single does not benefit you with a benefit more than itself, like your saying: 'Man' and 'Zayd' and the like. The Compound benefits you with a valid report, like your saying: 'Zayd is a prince', and 'Man is a living thing' and the like. The Compound is entirely divided into five parts with no sixth, which are: Either News (Declarative), Inquiry—which is Interrogation, Call (Vocative), Desire (Request), or Command (Imperative). These four [latter ones], truth and falsehood do not occur in them, nor does a primary demonstration stand upon them. As for those who deny the obligation of the Command, or [argue] regarding the obligation of accepting the Command due to a report necessitating it or by agreement of the two opponents, the Command is then demonstrated regarding the validity of its obligation, but it is not a demonstration [in itself]. A report may be enfolded in the Command; that is, the speaker saying: 'Do such,' enfolded in it is 'You are obliged to do such.' As for Prohibition, it is a type of Command types, because it is a command to abandon. Likewise, enfolded in the Request—which is Desire—is a report that the requester wants the requested thing. Do not think that your saying as a command: 'Stand' (Qum), is a single noun; that is a corrupt thought. Rather, it is compound because its meaning is 'Stand you' (Qum Anta). Likewise your saying reporting about an absent person: 'He stood' (Qama); if it were isolated in the reality of meaning without a pronoun, it would not be complete and would be deficient, so know it.",

As for Desire, if it exits its proper mode, falsehood may enter into it, like one who says while healthy: 'O God, heal me'; whereas the truth is to say: 'O God, perpetuate my health.' Likewise Interrogation, if one asks about a falsehood, like a questioner asking: 'Why did the heat intensify in winter?' As for News (Declarative), truth and falsehood enter into it. In it occurs Necessity and Persuasion. In the corrupt structure of it occurs Sophistry/Rioting. From the correct part of it, Demonstration stands upon every proposition in the world. It is what the Ancients and Moderns intended by speech (logic). Under it enter all Sharias (Laws) and every accepted matter of physics and others upon which people agreed or differed. It becomes valid through several ways: One is that its validity is known by primary reason or by the senses. Among it is what is validated by a proof establishing its validity from premises that produce results, as will occur in this register, God Almighty willing. And among it is what is transmitted by a truthful person whose truthfulness is established by proof from what we presented, or transmitted by those believed by necessity, as has occurred in other than this discourse. Some people thought that Oath, Condition, Wonder, and Doubt are additional modes to what we mentioned. That is a corrupt thought [17v], because they all fall under the division of News and return to it. As for the Oath, it is a report of your will; if you said: 'By God' (Wallahi), your saying that is merely swearing while magnifying the command of God Almighty. As for the Condition, it is a clear report with no hiddenness. The Doubt is likewise. Wonder is reporting the state you wondered at. Some people thought that among News is that which neither truth nor falsehood enters, which is the reporting of a delirious person about a matter whose validity is certain, which he did not intend [to report], like his saying: 'There is no god but God', or 'So-and-so died'. These are two correct reports. Abu Muhammad [Ibn Hazm] said: This thought is incorrect because no one is a reporter (Mukhbir) unless he intends the report. The Report (Khabar) is with the Reporter (Mukhbir) by way of relation (Idafah); so there is no Report without a Reporter. The delirious person is not a reporter by his speech, so his speech is not a Report.",

    "text": "Since the mention of Command has come to us, let us speak briefly on its divisions. Command is divided into sections, among them: The Obligatory Binding, which is the essence of Command; the word of Command is not removed from it except by a demonstrative evidence. Among them is the Encouraged but not binding. Among them is the Permissible, where leaving it is better. Among them is Disavowal, like the speaker saying: 'Do what you wish', while the commander is not pleased with the commanded. Among them is Threat, like His saying Almighty: {Do whatever you will} (41 Fussilat: 40). Among them is Sarcasm (1), like His saying Almighty: {Taste! Indeed, you are the honored, the noble} (44 Ad-Dukhan: 49). Among them is Confirmation, like saying to the disobedient: 'I forbade you, so be patient and bear what has come to you.' Among them is Incapacitation, like His saying Almighty: {Say, \"Be stones or iron\"} (17 Al-Isra: 50). Among them is what is in the meaning of Supplication, like the speaker saying: 'Go away, be chased away.' Among them is Scolding, like the speaker saying: 'Be chased away therein.' Among them is Formation (Creation), and this section belongs only to the Creator Almighty alone in His commanding what He wants to exist by existence (Kun), and what He wants to nullify by destruction. Among them is a command with the meaning of Prohibition, like saying to one whom you previously forbade from something: 'Do it, and you will see what happens', or 'Do it if you are a man', and the like. Among them is a command with the meaning of Wonder, like his saying: 'How good is Zayd!' (Ahsin bi-Zayd), meaning 'How good he is'. Then Nouns (Names) are also divided into four sections: Either Carrier-Describing (Universal Subject), Carrier-Described (Particular Subject), Carried-Described (Particular Predicate), or Carried-Describing (Universal Predicate). The meaning of your saying 'Describing' (Na'itah) is that it is said of a group of individuals under it, so all those individuals are named by that name. The meaning of our saying 'Described' (Man'utah) is that it is named by a single name while it is a group (or individual entity). The meaning of our saying 'Carrier' (Hamilah - Subject) is that they stand by themselves and carry others. The meaning of our saying 'Carried' (Mahmulah - Predicate) is that they do not stand by themselves. The mentioned Predication (Haml) is of two types: Essential Predication and Accidental Predication. The Essential is more general or equal, and is never more specific at all. The Accidental [18r] can be more general, equal, or more specific. The More General Essential Predication is like your saying: 'Man is Living'. For Life is predicated in Man as an essential predication, since without it he would not be a man, and Life also exists in other than Man. Therefore, we said this predication is more general. The Equal Essential Predication is like the existence of Life in the Living (Animal); it is equal to the Living; there is no life in a non-living thing, nor is there a living thing in the world without life.

Otherwise, it would not be permissible for us to name Him 'Living', since Life is only a power by which voluntary movement and sensation exist, and both matters are negated from the Creator, Mighty and Majestic. His Names, Almighty, are not derived at all, nor do they fall under any of the five divisions we mentioned. Rather, they are only Proper Names; no proof necessitated naming Him by them—except that we were commanded, Almighty, to name Him by them, call upon Him by them, and address Him by them; there is no god but He. The Demonstration only indicated that He, Almighty, is First, Truth, One, Creator only. Then we report about Him by His actions, Mighty and Majestic, only: such as giving life, giving death, shaping, arranging, and the like; or what we were commanded to name Him with, without there being anything there that necessitated naming Him that. It is not permissible for an Essential Predication to be more specific at all; in that case, it would be non-essential, since the Essential is that by which the entire species is named, not what is in some of it and not others. As for the More General Accidental Predication, it is like our saying of the Zanj (Negro): 'Black'. For Black is more general than Zanj, because blackness is in the crow, the jet (bead), and the *Marah* (1). As for the Equal Accidental Predication, it is like our saying of Man: 'Laughing'. Laughter is not in other than Man, and there is no Man except he is laughing. As for the More Specific Accidental Predication, it is like our saying of some people: 'Jurists' and 'Weavers' and the like. For these attributes are not found in every human, but in some of them, and they are not found in other than humans. From this predication may be what is the Most Specific of the Specific, like your saying: 'This person is Zayd'. As for the Possible Predication, it can be more general, like whiteness is in some people and others; and it can be more specific like medicine, which is only in some people, not all of them, nor in others; and it is not equal, like laughing is to Man. As for the Necessary Predication, it is divided into two parts: General like Life for the Living, and Equal like Laughing for Man. It can be more general like Life for him and others, but cannot be more specific. The Negation in the Impossible is more general only, like negating Inanimateness from Man; and perhaps it is found equal...",

As for the Carrier-Describing Things (Universal Subjects), it is like your saying: 'The Universal Man', meaning that which applies to all individuals of people. This is what God Almighty intended by His saying: {Indeed, mankind was created anxious} (70 Al-Ma'arij: 19). For He, Almighty, did not intend a specific human, but He, Mighty and Majestic, meant the whole Species. As for the Universal Man—and it may also be said: 'The Absolute Man'—he is a Carrier (Subject) for his attributes of Reason, Life, Color, Length, Width, and others; and a Describer (Predicate/Universal) for Zayd, Khalid, Hind, Zaynab, and every individual among people. This is called the 'Particular Man'. For Zayd is named a human, and Amr is named a human, and every one of the people likewise. So the Universal Man is a Describer for everyone we mentioned, meaning every one of the people is named by it. This section is never carried (a predicate/accident in the philosophical sense of relying on another) at all, meaning it is never an Accident, because the Accident is carried (mahmul) not a carrier (hamil), and the Substance is a carrier not carried. As for the Carrier-Described (Particular Subject): These are the Substantial Individuals, like your saying: Zayd, Amr, Khalid's dog, Ubayd's camel, and others. For all these are Described; they are all named by one name that gathers them as we explained. They are Carriers (Subjects) for their attributes of Knowledge, Bravery, Length, Width, Reason, and other attributes. These also are never Carried (Predicates) at all. As for the Carried-Describing (Universal Predicate): It is like our saying 'Knowledge' for any type of the soul's qualities. Under Knowledge are many types for which it is a gathering Genus, like Jurisprudence, Medicine, Philosophy, Grammar, Poetry, and others. Each one of these is named 'Knowledge'. So Knowledge describes them. Each one of these sciences is a Species under which fall varieties, individuals of chapters, and issues, like the falling of tribes and individuals of people under your saying: 'Man'. Thus is every Species under every Genus. So glory be to the Disposer of the World as He wills; there is no god but Him. Then we return to the interpretation of the Describing-Carried. We say: Universal Knowledge is carried in the souls of grammarians, and likewise every science in the souls of its people. We say: Every science among the sciences describes what is below it of chapters and issues; meaning all of them are named by the name of that science. So every issue of Grammar issues is named Grammar or Knowledge; every issue of Jurisprudence issues is named Jurisprudence and Knowledge; every proposition of Medicine propositions is named Medicine and Knowledge; every...",

These issues are called by (1) the Ancients 'Partial Knowledge'. The knowledge of every single person is also called 'Partial Knowledge', and all people's knowledge is called: 'Universal Knowledge'. As for the Carried-Described (Particular Predicate), it is the knowledge of every man individually [19r], and they are also the issues of every science. For they are carried in the soul of the one knowing them, and they are described by the name of the Science gathering them—meaning they are all named 'Knowledge'—as we said. Know that the Describer may be Described, except that there must be at the first of its ends a Describer that nothing describes, which is the Genus of Genera we presented first; and there must be at the last of its ends a Described that describes nothing, which are the Individuals of Substances—as we presented. Know that the Carrier is never Carried at all, and the Carried is never a Carrier at all. For we have explained that the Carrier is that which stands by itself, and the Carried is that which does not stand by itself. So it is impossible, not formable in the mind, that a thing be standing by itself and not standing by itself [simultaneously]. Some of our friends annoyed me with a tribulation brought upon him by his good opinion of speech he read by the heavy-prattler nicknamed Abu al-Abbas, known as Al-Nashi'. He was always asking me the difference between the 'Carried' (Mahmul - Predicate/Accident) and the 'Situated' (Mutamakkin - Place-occupier). The Creator Almighty did not help him, up to our time in which we wrote this book of ours, to understand the difference between them. It is that 'The Carried' (Mahmul) you say only regarding attributes that become nullified by the nullification of what they are in, like Zayd's whiteness and life. For if Zayd is nullified, his life and whiteness are nullified, without doubt. His whiteness may also be nullified while Zayd is not nullified but remains correct and sound, either due to paleness or some accidents. 'The Situated' (Mutamakkin) we say only regarding Substances that do not become nullified by the nullification of what they are in, like the being of Zayd in the house; then the house is demolished and becomes a hill or a pit (2), while Zayd is standing, sound, looking into his affairs. Zayd leaves the house and neither of them is nullified. Thus, the parts of the body in the body are Situated, not Carried. This is a difference not confused to one of sound sense or fairness. In sum, the being of a body in a body...",

Since the Genus is nothing other than its Species, and the Genus and its Species are nothing other than the Individuals falling under them. Know that the Differentiae (Fasl) of every Genus of the Genera describe everything under it of its Species, and every individual of the individuals falling under its Species. Like 'Sensing' (Hassas); it is said of every Living thing, and of every Human, Horse, and Donkey, and of Zayd, Amr, Hind, and all individuals of animals. And so on in all Genera and Species. We also said: Genera give everything under them—species or individual—their names and definitions. Meaning that the name of that Genus alone names and defines every species under it and every individual falling under [19v] every species of the species of that Genus. Know that the Differentiae of every Species are not found in another Species at all, in any way—neither its name nor its definition.

The Ancients named (1) the individuals of Substances: 'Primary Substances', meaning by that Zayd, Amr, Abdullah's camel, Khalid's dog, Amr's garment, and the like.

By this meaning, the First [God] would be a contrary to His creation, because He, Mighty and Majestic, has no Quality at all, and Contrariety only occurs in a Quality upon a qualified subject. So the Creator, Mighty and Majestic, is not a contrary, nor opposed, nor incompatible; there is no god but He. Substance is not said to be 'stronger' or 'weaker'; meaning a donkey is not 'stronger in donkeyness' than another donkey, nor a goat 'stronger in goatness' than another goat, nor a human 'weaker in humanness' than another human. Likewise Quantity also, as will occur in its chapter, God Mighty and Majestic willing. Contrariety and 'stronger/weaker' only occur in some Qualities as will occur in their chapter, God willing. The definition (sketch) of Substance is that you say: It is the Self-Subsisting, Receptive to Contraries. For the Soul stands by itself and accepts knowledge and ignorance, bravery and cowardice, integrity and greed, and other contraries of its character which are its qualities. Likewise, many bodies accept whiteness and blackness—one of which is a color dispersing vision, which is white, and the second gathering vision, which is black. Many of them accept heat and cold; and tactile qualities which are roughness or smoothness; and scent which is perfume or stench; and other attributes upon which senses fall. So every self-subsisting thing is receptive to contraries because it is a carrier for them in its essence. By this, the Creator, Mighty and Majestic, is excluded from being a substance or named a substance, because He, Almighty, is not a carrier for anything of qualities at all [20r], so He is not a substance. As for what (1) some people think—that Quality accepts contraries because Color accepts whiteness and redness—that is a corrupt thought. Because the species of Quality, some of them are the Contraries themselves. They are contrary by their essence, not carriers of contrariety in their essence; rather, they are the Carried Contraries themselves. The Substance is the carrier for them, like Zayd: at one time he is a boy, another time an old man; at one time yellow from fear or sickness, another time brown from the sun; at one time hot due to proximity to fire, and another cold due to proximity to snow; at one time sitting and another standing. And he is Zayd himself. All these are qualities and accidents succeeding upon him, going and coming; some are contrary and some are different.

Because speech and imagination are either truth or falsehood, based on the validity of the meaning of the imagined thing or the speech, or its invalidity. Truth and falsehood do not alternate upon a single speech; rather, they are two [different] speeches: one is truth and the other is falsehood. The same applies to imagination. 2 - Discourse on Quantity (Which is Number): The Ancients mentioned that Quantity falls into seven types: First is Number, then Body, then Surface, then Line, then Place, then Time, then Speech. Then these seven are divided into two parts: One is Discrete and the other is Continuous. That which has a common boundary (Fasl Mushtarak) includes five of these seven: Body, Surface, Line, Place, and Time. The common boundary for the Body is the Surface; the common boundary for the Surface is the Line; the common boundary for the Line is the Point; the common boundary for Time is the 'Now'; and Place also has a common boundary. The Discrete is that which has an order but no common boundary, which are: Number and Speech. Abu Muhammad Ali bin Ahmed—may God be pleased with him—said: We will, God Almighty willing, explain what we mentioned in this, according to what we stipulated at the beginning of the book. There is no power or strength except in God, the High, the Great. We say: The section that is 'Number' among these seven is the true Quantity, and there is no Quantity other than it. However, it applies to the other types we mentioned. Its application to the Body is by its measurement (area/volume): for every body in the world has a measurement, whether small or large. Measurement is a number found by an agreed-upon amount: either a span, a cubit, a mile [20v], a parasang, the thickness of a fingernail or a hair, or less or more. For this reason, they included Body in the category of Quantity. Number also applies to Bodies in another way, which is the number of its parts after they are divided, or the number of individuals if you wish to count a group of them. 'Bodies' (Ajaram) are 'Physical Bodies' (Ajsam). You count whatever you want of them by one, two, three, four, until you reach what you wish to count of them. I have seen some who claim this science criticize the Ancients for including Body under Quantity. This indicates this objector's absence from this science and from the intended truth...",

    "text": "...Had this class of people been fair or abandoned learning, it would have been more protective of knowledge, less harmful to its people, and of greater benefit. But God Almighty spoke the truth when He said: {And they will not cease to differ, except whom your Lord has given mercy, and for that He created them} (11 Hud: 118-119). The mentioned Body is everything long, wide, and deep. As for the application of Number to the Surface, it is a limit (end) from all its six directions. This is also one of the ways Number applies to the Body, for every Body must have six directions: Up, Down, Front, Back, Right, and Left. Every Body must have these six directions, and there is no way to a seventh direction. Six is a number, so this is a necessary number applying to every Body. The application of Number by measurement to the Body is exactly its application to the Surface. We also say, adding explanation regarding the Surface: The Surface is the termination of every body that meets another body, [whether] air, earth, or other than that—whatever body it is. Measurement applies to the Surface, as we presented, since every Surface has a certain amount, measured in cubits or counted, as we described just now. As for the application of Number to the Line, it is the finite limit of every Surface and its termination. I will exemplify that with an example to increase clarity, so I say: The knife is a body; the limit of its two sides is a surface; the limit of each of its sides is a line. From the beginning of its sharp edge to its end is a line. Likewise, what is taken from the limit of its surface with the edge of its spine is a line. Its end (limit) is the Point. Number, area, and measurement do not apply to the Point because it is not a 'thing' at all; it is merely a name expressing the cut-off, the limit, and the lack of continuation of that body only. The mentioned Line also has a measurement which is measured in cubits or counted; this is also one of the ways Number applies to the Body. As for the application of Number to Place, Place is also a body among [21r] bodies, because it is either earth, air, water, a carpet, or other than that—whatever body contains another body. Every thing among what we mentioned has an area and a counted measurement.",

    "text": "As for the application of Number to Time, times are three: Present, Past (1), and Future. This is one way Number applies to Time. Also, Time is the duration of a body remaining stationary or moving. Motions are counted as first, second, and so on as they increase; thus, Number is necessary and applies to it from this aspect. Otherwise, Time is not a pure, abstract number, but is composed of a body, its quality in rest or motion, and the number of that quality. As for Speech: The Ancients only intended by that the number of melody tones and the number of meanings of speech, for all of that has a number limited in itself—some of which we know and some of which is obscure to us. They also intended by that the letters heard via the sound propelled from the exits of speech, which the common people call \"Letters of the Alphabet\" (Huruf al-Hija), starting with Abjad and Alif, Ba, Ta, Tha. They are limited and counted, with no increase in Nature at all, even if their numbers vary in languages. In Arabic, they are twenty-eight letters; that is where our counting ended. The informant, Abu al-Futuh al-Jurjani, informed me that in the Persian language they reach forty letters. I did not ask him about the quality of that, unless they count among them the sounds resulting from the saturation of the three vowels—which are Raf' (u), Nasb (a), and Khafd (i)—then they reach forty-one letters. Discussion of this meaning has another place. As for Number itself, it is: Two, Three, Four, and whatever exceeds that. One is a principle (origin) and is not a number, as we will explain at the end of this chapter, God Almighty willing. As for what we mentioned just now that some Quantity is Continuous and some is Discrete, and what we mentioned regarding the Common Boundary: The meaning of the Common Boundary is that for the types to which Number applies, there is a limit (end) such that if it meets the limit of another thing of its type, the two things unite together—meaning they become one thing.

Likewise, if a surface meets a surface, they become one line [Note: text says line, likely implies surface continuity], after the two surfaces were [21v] separated—like the surface of dough you joined to the surface of another dough, becoming one dough, and the like. The same is said regarding the meeting of two lines. All of that is only by joining a body to a body. Likewise, a place where Zayd was, and a place where Amr was beside him; if they stood up from it, the two places became one place. This is the Common Boundary between two bodies, which is the end of the first and the beginning of the second. It is not a part of them nor of either of them, but is a limit raised by the occurring meeting. Likewise is the Common Boundary of Time; it is your saying \"Now.\" For the \"Now\" is the end of the past and the beginning of the future. When the future comes, that which was \"Now\" becomes past, along with the past before it, so they unite—meaning they become one past time. And your saying \"Now\" is a state, neither past nor future. This is what we said regarding it being continuous; two things from it become one thing. As for our saying regarding Number and Speech that they are Discrete and have an order but no common boundary: It is because the letters we mentioned just now—the letters of the alphabet—it is not permissible for the Ba to join with the Ta and become together one Ba and one Ta or one letter. Likewise the Ba and Ta with the Ta, and every letter with its like or its opposite; there is no difference. This is contrary to what we mentioned before about two places becoming one place, two bodies becoming one body, two surfaces becoming one surface, and two lines becoming one line. However, these letters have an order in joining one to another; from that order, the understanding of meanings in speech arises. Likewise musical tones; it is not permissible for two tones to become one tone, nor two meanings one meaning. But for all of that, there is a known order. For this reason, Speech was called Discrete, and it was said regarding it that it has [no] common boundary [Note: Text says 'it has', context implies 'has no' or distinct separation]. Likewise Number; it is not permissible to join a Three that has ended, starting another, so the two Threes become one Three. And so is every number, unless some numbers are joined to others in a known order and arrangement by which the ratio of some to others is known, and the occurrence of numbers from adding some to others. This is the utmost clarity in this chapter, and we left no ambiguity in it by the power of God Almighty and His strength arriving to us...",

The Ancients also mentioned another division for the types of Quantity we mentioned, which is also divided into two parts: One is that which has [22r] a Position (Positional), and the other is Non-Positional. The interpretation of that is that his saying \"Positional\" is an expression for what has fixed parts. And his saying \"Non-Positional\" is an expression for what does not have fixed parts. That which has fixed parts includes Body, Surface, Line, and Place, because the parts of each of these are stable as counting passes over them. For whenever you measure a Place or Body, what you measured of it remains along with what you will measure of the remainder. The Line and Surface have counted measurement along with the number of the measurement of the Body carrying them. As for that which is Non-Positional, it includes Time, Number, and Speech. For if you say \"Yesterday\" or count the hours of your day, you find everything you count of that vanishing, passing, not fixed nor remaining. Thus passes the first and then the first [next] of Time; everything that passes of it is vanishing and non-existent, contrary to what we mentioned before regarding the permanence of the parts of the Body. We find the parts of Time that have not come yet to be non-existent, contrary to all parts of the Body and what Number folds within it of its surfaces and lines. The Time you are in does not stabilize with a stability you can establish or hold onto at all, in any way. Rather, it stabilizes then expires without delay, and so on always. Likewise, the parts of Speech; if you speak its letters, organization, and meanings, everything you spoke of that has perished and ceased to exist. What you have not spoken of it is non-existent, not having happened yet. The part you are in of all that, you have no power to establish, hold, or fix at all, in any way. Rather, it expires first by first without delay. So glory be to the Inventor of the World and its Disposer. As for one who thinks that Qualities may also fall under Quantity because he heard people say \"Much whiteness\" and \"Little whiteness,\" that is a corrupt thought. Because he only means by that the surface of the Body carrying the color, or its narrowness and lack of measurement. Quantity here belongs to the area of the Body carrying it as we presented before.

Quantity has no contrary (opposite) at all; there is no contrary to a Cubit, nor a contrary to a Span, and likewise other amounts of Quantity. Similarly, one who thinks that Many is the contrary of Few, and Big is the contrary of Small—his thought is corrupt. That belongs to the category of Relation (Idafah), since there is nothing in the world Big by its essence, nor Small by its essence. Rather, the Big is big in relation to what is smaller than it, and the Small is small in relation to what is bigger than it. Do you not see the mustard seed? Likewise, the Earth is small in relation to the Heaven (Firmament). There is no part, however minute, except that a more minute one is imagined [22v]. Likewise the Highest Sphere, which has nothing in actuality bigger than it; yet in the power of the Creator Almighty, increase in it and the creation of what is greater than it is imaginable. We may say: A small mountain, and a big mustard seed, in relation to a bigger mountain, and in relation to another smaller mustard seed. If Small were a contrary to Big, it would be a contrary to itself, because it is big from one perspective and small from another; this is impossible. The same applies to Few and Many, with no difference. For a hundred is few in relation to a thousand, and many in relation to ten. Thus is every number; increase upon it is always imaginable. Except that whatever emerges from it into actuality is finite (1) always. If there were ten people in a city, that would be a very small number; but if they were with a man and a woman in a house, they would be a very large number; likewise if they were his sons. Know that Many, Few, Long, Short, Small, Great, Despicable, Grand, Minute, Huge, Tiny, Thick, Thin, Massive, Slight, Trivial, and Scant—all these belong to the category of Quantity (via Relation). Nothing is described by them in the world absolutely, but in relation to what is above it or below it—as we presented. Before and After also fall under Number, because two is before three; and they occur in Time; and they occur in Relation as will be mentioned in its chapter, God Almighty willing. Quantity is every meaning where the question \"How much?\" (Kam) is appropriate. Quantity does not accept \"Stronger\" nor \"Weaker\" (Intensity). You do not say five is \"more five\" than [another] five, nor weaker than it in that either. Thus you do not say: A time is \"more time-like\" than...",

The Property (Khassah) of Quantity is not found in other than Quantity, nor is any type of Quantity devoid of it: It is Equal and Unequal, Many and Few, Excess and Deficiency. For you say: This ten is equal to eight and two, and unequal to eight alone. And so on in all types of Quantity. This is an expression for which the Arabic language gave no other [specific term], and Quality may share in it. This is evident in the Latin language, according to us, with a clear evidence that is not confused; it has a word specific to Quantity excluding the rest of the Ten Categories. Quality also has in Latin a word specific to it with a clear indication having no ambiguity, excluding other Categories, for which no matching translation exists in Arabic. In such cases, one resorts to what is furthest from ambiguity according to what exists in the language. Success is by God Almighty [23r]. By what we mentioned, it becomes clear that One is not a Number, because Number is what finds another number equal to it; and One has no number equal to it, because if you divide it, it is not one but becomes a fraction then. By this, it is necessary that the True One is only the Creator, the Originator of all creation, and He is not a counted number, while all creation is counted. 3 - Chapter on Quality (Kayfiyyah): Quality almost encompasses all nine Categories, excluding Substance. But since it is an answer to what is asked with \"How?\" (Kayfa), it does not encompass them with an absolute, universal generality. For whoever asks: \"How is this?\" is not answered: \"It is seven cubits,\" nor \"It is yesterday,\" nor \"It is in the mosque.\" Quality is everything that alternates upon all bodies—those with souls and those without souls—such as a state of health, sickness, wealth, poverty, obscurity, and color. Whether the matters we mentioned are fleeting, like the yellowing of fear, the redness of shame, and the gloom of grief; or non-fleeting, like the yellowness of gold, the greenness of vegetables, the redness of blood, the blackness of tar, and the whiteness of crystal. Among Qualities also are all accidents of the soul: reason, foolishness, determination, silliness...",

Among them are Tastes, Scents, Tactile qualities, compositions of Speech, Heat, Cold, Forms in all shapes, and other Accidents. All of that is Quality. Contrariety (Taddad) exists only in Qualities specifically. It is not in every Quality, but in some and not others. Qualities are very many species; in some species of Quality, contrariety occurs, so one species is a contrary to another species by their essence. Among the properties of Qualities also is that some are stronger (more intense) than others, and some weaker, just as some Quantities are more than others and some less. You say: The sound of thunder is stronger (louder) than the sound of a duck, the scent of musk is more fragrant than the scent of sandalwood, the taste of honey is sweeter than the taste of colocynth. Likewise in roughness, softness, colors, and many Qualities. That only occurs in those that have intermediates between two contraries and accept mixture and the interpenetration of one another—not in every Quality, as we will explain in the Chapter of Discourse on Opposition, God Almighty willing. As for the equality of its individuals under the Species gathering them under the Genus, it is not permissible for \"Stronger\" or \"Weaker\" to occur in any of that. Nor [23v] is it permissible to say: A color is \"more color-like\" than another color, regarding each of them being a color. We do not mean by that brightness or dullness. Likewise, a truth is not \"more true\" than another truth, nor a lie \"more lying\" than another lie. This only varies in sin and ugliness. Otherwise, the lie of a joke is a pure lie, and the lie against the Creator Almighty is a pure lie; likewise, the impossible is a pure lie. All are equal in being lies, a correct equality with no differentiation, no stronger and no weaker. But some are greater in sin and uglier in abomination than others. Likewise, the knowledge of one thing is not \"more correct\" than the knowledge of another thing, nor ignorance of one thing \"more ignorance\" than ignorance of another thing; no stronger and no weaker. If the mediation of doubt enters any of that, that Quality exits from being Knowledge entirely, and that Conjecture does not fall under the species of Knowledge. Likewise, a blackness is not counting \"blacker\" than another blackness unless whiteness, redness, greenness, or yellowness has entered (mixed with) one of the blacknesses. Likewise, a speed is not \"faster\" than...",

Contemplate this with your intellect and you will find it certainly correct, with no deviation for you from it at all. As for the Property (Khassah) that characterizes all Qualities and from which no Quality is devoid at all, it is: Similar and Dissimilar. For you say: This truth is similar to this truth, and this lie is dissimilar to this lie; and so on in every Quality. We mentioned before that this is an expression for which we could not find a clearer one in the Arabic language. For this meaning in Latin, there is a word of clear expression, unequivocal, for which no matching translation was found in Arabic, so recourse was made to the closest found to remove ambiguity. Qualities are Genera, intermediate Species, and Species of Species. For Color is a species under Quality and a Genus for what is below it; then Whiteness, Redness, Greenness, and Yellowness are species under Color having various individuals. Thus are the qualities of the Soul: Virtue is under Quality; Patience is a species under Virtue; Forbearance is a species under Patience. This is very numerous. We say: Qualities are divided into two parts: Physical and Psychological. Physical is what is general to bodies or specific to some, like Color, Taste, Tactile quality, and others. Psychological is what is general to souls or specific to some, like Reason, Foolishness, Knowledge, Ignorance, Thought, Memory, Imagination, and other character traits of the Soul. We also say: The two parts we mentioned are each divided into two parts: One is what is In Potentiality (Bil-quwwah), which is what is possible to appear but has not appeared yet. Like the sitting of the standing person, the disbelief of the believer, the belief of the disbeliever, the anger of the forbearing, the forbearance of the angry [24r], and the blackness of what accepts dye which has not been dyed yet, and the like. The second is what is In Actuality (Bil-fi'l), which has appeared and is known by sense, or by mediation of sense, or by intellect. Like the redness of the red, the tallness of the tall, the sweetness of the sweet, the belief of the believer, the forbearance of the forbearing, and the like. This is the meaning of what we understand from the narration about the Ancients that they say: \"This matter is In Potentiality\" and \"This matter is In Actuality.\" They only mean by \"In Potentiality\": Possibility, and what the structure or rank bears to exist in it or by it. And they mean by \"In Actuality\": That which has appeared, existed, and become necessary. Then we say: Qualities are also divided; one is called \"State\" (Hal)...",

The second is called \"Disposition/Form\" (Hay'ah), which is what is not known to vanish from what it is in, unless its vanishing is imagined while the thing it is in remains as it is: like the nature of greed, the nature of impetuosity, the nature of silliness, the blueness of the blue-eyed, the pug-nose of the snub-nosed, and the like. As for the Physical Quality, it falls under the Senses. It is divided: One part transforms its contrary, if it meets it, into its own nature; this is called \"Active\" (Fa'il). This is like Heat and Cold; for Heat, if it meets Cold that does not resist it, gives its carrier heat; and Cold, if it meets Heat that does not resist it, gives its carrier cold (Note: text says heat, likely error for cold). The second part is weaker in this command and the action of the first part is frequent in it; this second part is called \"Passive\" (Munfa'il). That is like Moisture and Dryness; for Heat, if it meets a moist thing, dries it, and may also moisten it by causing moisture to ascend to it. The occurrence of Physical Quality under the Senses divides into five parts: One is what is perceived by the sense of Sight; the second is what is perceived by the sense of Hearing; the third is what is perceived by the sense of Smell; the fourth is what is perceived by the sense of Taste; and the fifth is what is perceived by the sense of Touch by the hand or the whole body. All these senses are conveyors to the Soul, and the Soul is the sensor and perceiver via these senses delivering to it. These senses are to the Soul like doors, alleys, outlets, and roads. The proof of that is that if the Soul is distracted or occupied by a distraction, all senses are nullified, despite the senses being sound. So glory be to the Disposer, there is no god but He. That which Sight perceives is divided into two parts: One is what is perceived by looking with the eye purely only, and that is nothing other than Colors. The second is what the Soul perceives by intellect and knowledge, and by the mediation of Color and Touch or both together; such as the limit of length and width, the shape of every shaped thing (round, square, etc.), motion or rest, or [24v] the hugeness of a body and its slenderness, and the like.

All of this the Sighted perceives; and the Blind perceives by Touch, just as we said regarding Color, exactly the same. If you touch the tactile surface of a thing moving, you know that the carrier of that tactile surface is moving; and if you touch it stationary, you know its carrier is stationary regarding the essence (what-ness) of vision and its perception. Among this is what is perceived by the mediation of Color alone and the Intellect; they deliver to the Soul what they perceived and what the Intellect understood by the mediation of its perception and the perception of the Sighted [text unclear: Mu'all/Mughfal?], such as meanings understood from writing in a book. For by the termination of the colors of the lines (letters), you know the letters from whose composition you understand the meaning. And like your knowledge of the condition of a human, that he is ashamed, afraid, broken, angry, a king, or a scholar, and the like. From your knowledge by seeing the color and knowing the attributes, you knew who the seen person is and what he is. Discussion of the essence of Vision and its perception of colors has another place. However, we mention a part of it here according to the entitlement of this register: Vision, if it meets a colored object and stops, you know that its carrier has ended and its length has ended. Likewise, you know that two lines/rays exit from the two pupils falling upon the seen object without time, and by the formation of that seen object in them; and in the power of the observer is the acceptance of all colors. We only said \"without time\" because you see the stars in the distant spheres if you close your eyes and then open them, without time (instantly). Likewise, if you close your eyes and then open them, you see the closest things to you in the same state in which you saw the stars, not faster. So it is correct that it falls upon the seen object without time. Also, on the path to the seen object are many things the vision does not fall upon, either due to darkness around them or the resemblance of colors. If it crossed places by a temporal movement, it would see the nearer before the farther. We only asserted the exit of the two lines (rays) from the two pupils—excluding the other opinion of some Ancients—because we are able to direct those two lines however we wish, with another mirror, returning the power of sight to the back of the viewer. Those two lines may also be returned by rising vapors, water, and other things, and by a mirror in them, so those two lines reflect and you see your face. Likewise, the sound exiting from the shouter reflects opposite the mountain after it strikes the mountain, returning to the ear of that shouter, so he hears his own voice as if another speaker replied [25r] to him with the likeness of his speech.

It crosses places in a varying duration according to distance and proximity, and the strength of the strike and its weakness. For that reason, there is a duration between the first strike—which is the element of sound—and the listener's hearing of it. We clarify that: If the sound-maker is very far from you, it is valid that there is a duration, like what is witnessed of the fuller beating the ground with the cloth; we see him when he lifts it without time (instantly), then he holds it for a while, and only then the sound reaches us. The same is said regarding thunder occurring with lightning; the lightning is seen first when it occurs in the atmosphere without delay, then it stays for a while, and then the thunder is heard. That is the decree of the Exalted, the All-Knowing. The second part is what the Soul perceives by intellect and knowledge and by the mediation of sound, such as the composition of melodies, the structure of tones, the meanings of heard speech, and the like, since that was delivered to us by the sense of Hearing and its mediation. By this part, it is valid for us to say we heard the speech of God Almighty, and we heard the speech of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and we heard the speech of So-and-so and So-and-so whom we did not witness and whose time preceded among the past eloquent ones and poets, and everyone whose speech was narrated to us. From that is your distinguishing by speech who the speaker is and what his state is: a beggar, a king, or sick, and the like; and like your knowledge of what the sound-maker is and which thing it is. As for the Perceived by Smell, they are Scents (Spirits) of perfume and stench, and what follows them of intermediates like the smells of some minerals and the like. Smell is the Soul's perception, by the mediation of the nose's smelling, of a change occurring in the air between them and the smelled object, and an affection from the nature of the smelled object and the dissolution of some of its parts from its moistures. The Soul may also perceive, by the mediation of Intellect and Smell, the knowledge of the essence (what-ness) of the smelled object of the scent, like our knowing the intoxicant by distinguishing its smell; and stench likewise, and other smelled things. As for the Perceived by Taste, they are Flavors, such as Sweetness, Bitterness, Insipidity, Acridity/Bitterness (1), Salinity, Sourness, Pungency, and Astringency.

The mentioned organs [25v] may also perceive some flavors by the mediation of air and the dissolution of some parts of the tasted object in it, like crushed colocynth. The Soul may also perceive, by the mediation of Taste and Intellect, the knowledge of the essence of the tasted object, like our knowledge by tasting honey in the dark that it is honey, and likewise other tasted things. Our knowledge that it is honey is other than our knowledge that it is sweet. Knowing it is sweet is by taste purely; knowing it is honey is by the mediation of Intellect and Taste together. The same is said regarding the previous divisions in other senses. As for what nothing dissolves from, it has no taste and no smell, like some stones, glass, and the like. The Soul perceives the taste according to the strength of what dissolves from the tasted object. As for the Perceived by Touch, it is divided into two parts: One is what the Soul perceives by the contact of the skin of the healthy body with the surface of the touched object without the mediation of anything between them. Either from the evenness of the parts of its surface, called Smoothness; or from its stability, called Hardness; or from their separation, called Friability (pouring/looseness); or from the difference of the parts of its surface, called Roughness. The second is what the Soul perceived by Intellect and Knowledge or by the mediation of the mentioned Touch or Vision, like what we presented before of knowing the limits of the body, the quality of shapes, motion, and the essence of the touched object—what thing it is. For it is known what it is by the mediation of Intellect and Touch together, or by the Soul's sense purely, or by the mediation of Touch alone, like Heat, Cold, Moisture, and Dryness. It is correct as you see that the Intellect shares in all senses regarding what they perceive, and stands alone from them in indicating many things and perceiving numerous things. 4 - Chapter on Relation (Idafah): Relation in reality: is joining a thing to a thing.

As for the purpose intended by Relation in this place, it is the ratio of two homogeneous things, the stability of each one depends on the stability of the other, revolving upon it and not negating it. The meaning of our saying 'homogeneous' is that they are under one Genus of the Ten Categories which we presented as the Genera of Genera. The Two Related Things are two things where one is not established except by the establishment of the other. In general, when the Ancients saw two things where one is not established except by the establishment of the other, and that joining each to its companion [produced] a third meaning other than them, they appointed that [26r] meaning as a Head of the Heads of Categories, which is Relation. They spoke about it abstractly, even if it cannot be abstract, just as they spoke about Quality abstractly, Quantity abstractly, and Substance abstractly. Although Substance is never devoid of Quality, Quantity, Time, and Place; nor is Quality devoid of a Substance carrying it; nor is Quantity devoid of a numbered thing; nor Time from a stationary or moving thing; nor Place from a situated thing. But [they did so] to distinguish varying things, so the judgment of each thing individually becomes clear to every seeker of knowledge. For the tribulation in opinions and religions only came from the mixing of speech and the weakness in extracting the judgment of every thing regarding what is specific to it excluding others. The Related is divided into Symmetrical (Nazir) and Non-Symmetrical. The Symmetrical is that in which the two related parties agree in name and relation together, like your saying: Friend, Neighbor, Brother, or Enemy. For no one is a friend to anyone unless that other is a friend to him; likewise the Enemy, the Brother, and the Neighbor. As for what belongs to [the reality of] this relation, like Friend and Enemy, a person may be a friend to one who is not a friend to him—meaning loving—and likewise the Enemy; a person may be hostile to one who loves him, like many sons to their fathers and some spouses to each other. As for the Non-Symmetrical, it is divided into two parts: One is where the essence of each of the related parties existed before the relation, like Master and Slave, Husband and Wife; for the slave may exist before being a slave (owned), and likewise his master. The second part is where the essence of one of the related parties existed before the relation and before the other related party. That is like Father and Son; for the essence of...",

In general, the entitlement of one of the two related parties to the name of the relation between them is equal; neither precedes the other in it. This is because if one of the related parties is mentioned by the name that necessitates the relation, it indicates the existence of the other by necessity. And so it is with every related thing. Likewise, it is not permissible to say 'Double' unless 'Doubled' (Half) is necessary. The Doubled is a half of a number called the 'Second Half' when added to this half, becoming a double of it. The same is said regarding Small and Big, Few and Many, Light and Heavy, Loose and Compact [26v], Equal and Like, and other things that necessitate a related counterpart. Relation occurs in all Categories if you are correct in managing it and applying its judgment. For you say regarding Quality: The form is a form for the one formed by it, and the one formed by the form is a possessor of form; the curly is curly by curliness, and curliness is the curliness of the curly. Likewise, Knowledge necessitates a Knower, and the Knower among us necessitates Knowledge; and so on with other Qualities. Likewise all Quantities: Number necessitates a Numbered, and the Numbered necessitates a Number. Likewise, Place necessitates a Situated (occupant), and the Situated necessitates a Place. Likewise, the Possessor of Time necessitates Time, and Time necessitates a Possessor of Time. And likewise Standing, Sitting, Possession, Action, and Affection. Relation is only correct if you are accurate in the wording of its application and management. Similarly, the Ancients said that Relation exists in all Categories by Accident, not by Nature; meaning it is not present in the requirement of the word in every case. Because if you said: 'The bird is a bird by the wing,' it would be incorrect, because you find a possessor of wings that does not fly, like the ostrich, and you find what has lost its wing due to an affliction still called a bird. But if you said: 'The winged is winged by the wing, and the wing is a wing for the winged,' it would be a correct and valid statement. So guard against the likes of this in your debate and your seeking of truths. For you might be compelled regarding a thing that it necessitates another thing, and you concede to it, while it is not obligatory upon you, otherwise it would bind you—based on what we presented. This is among the fallacies of the deceitful riffraff, such as the saying of some liars: 'The Doer (Agent), because of his action, is a body.'

This is a correct proposition known by the soul through primary reason. Some have used sophistry: 'The Hearer is a hearer by hearing, and the Living is living by life,' wanting to necessitate for the Creator Almighty life and hearing [as accidents]; He is exalted above that with great highness. We did not name the Creator Almighty 'Living' due to the existence of 'life' for Him [as an accident] such that relating life to Him would bind us; nor is the naming of Him Almighty as 'Seeing' likewise. We only named Him Living, Hearing, and Seeing following the Text (Revelation), not because a meaning necessitated it. None of that is derived from an accident in Him—God is exalted above the sayings of the atheist ignoramuses—nor does it fall under Genera and Species, nor [27r] via the carrying of Accidents. All of this implies composition which exists only in a created being. Rather, these are Proper Names for the Creator Almighty only. Likewise, the statement that 'The oar is an oar for the ship, and the ship is a ship by the oar' is an error. The correct statement is: 'The oar is an oar for the rowed object, and the rowed object is rowed by the oar.' Similarly, if a human said: 'The head is a head by the human, and the human is a human by the head,' it would be an error, since there may be a possessor of a head that is not a human. But the correct statement is: 'The possessor of the head is a head-possessor by the head, and the head is a head for the head-possessor.' This rank is the utmost correctness and Relation. These are the four Heads, and the remaining six are composed of them as will occur in their chapters, God Almighty willing. 5 - Discourse on Time (Zaman): We presented in the chapter on Quantity what Time is and what we mean by this word, and that it is the duration of the existence of a body, static or moving. If there were no duration, there would be no body. We mentioned in the chapter on Relation the aspect of Time being related (relative). God, Glorious and Exalted, is not a body nor carried in a body, so He has no time and no duration; God is exalted above that. If He Almighty had a duration, He would have a 'first' and a 'last' other than Himself. If that were so, Number would apply to them, and they would enter via their number under a type of Quantity. If that were so, He Almighty would be limited and created; God is exalted above that. He Almighty is not gathered with His creation by a number, since two things are not counted by one number unless they are gathered in one meaning, and there is no meaning to gather the Creator and the creation at all.",

    "text": "Time is divided into three parts: One is Static (Residing), which the grammarians call the Present verb; then Past; then Coming, which the grammarians call the Future verb. They have engaged much in discussing which of them is first. This is only due to ignorance of the natures of things and their realities. This matter is clear: The State (Hal), which is the Static Time, is the first of all of them, because Action is movement or rest occurring in a duration. If the time of the Action is first relative to other times, then the Action within it is first relative to other actions by necessity. The Static Time is the first of all times because before it existed as static, it was not existing at all, nor was it a thing whatsoever. What is not a thing is merely non-existence ('Adam), so there is no way to speak of it as anything other than non-existence and nothingness. Then when it existed, that was the first of its ranks in reality. Then it expired and became Past, and speaking about it became valid because it had been a true [27v] existent. Those who erred in this chapter erred for two reasons: One is that he looked at the state of himself; when he found himself anticipating matters before their being, and time before its arrival and before the passing of all that, he estimated that Future Time is before the Static and before the Past. This is a gross error and severe ignorance, because he agrees with us from where he does not understand. Do you not see that he only made it first in rank being 'future' because it had not come yet? This is the Static Time in reality, and his doing that is the action of the 'State' (Present) because it is other than it. It is what we said before is the first of times and the precedence of actions. Then that anticipated time and the expected action came together after that. The Past is more verified than the Future because the Past has been existent and a valid meaning about which reporting is good, and upon which Quantity and Quality apply. The Future is contrary to all of that. Know that the Existent among these times is the Static alone. And the Existent among Actions is that named 'State' (Present) which is in the Static Time. Because the Past was only existent, fixed, valid, real, and a 'thing' when it was Static; then when it transferred from the rank of being Static, it became non-existent, nullified, and vanished. The Future only exists, becomes valid, fixed, and becomes a reality and a 'thing' when it is Static; as for before that, it is not a 'thing', but rather non-existence and void. Ponder this with your intellect, and you will find it necessary and certain, with no deviation from it and no way to other than it, except for one who stubbornly denies his senses and rejects his intellect; we seek refuge in God from that. The second reason is that he who did not verify the investigation, when he could not hold Time...",

    "text": "...for two moments, the grasp of Time escaped him and he could hardly verify that with his senses. You must know that Time does not stay fixed; it is merely passing always, thing after thing. The Static Time is the 'Now'. For your saying 'Now' is a boundary existing always between the Past time and the Coming time. The 'Now' is the truly existent part of Time always; what is before 'Now' is Past, and what is after 'Now' is Future. However, the expression in the Arabic language for the Static Time and the Future Time uses a single word, whereas in foreign language[s] it is in two different forms, which is clearer in explanation and understanding. However, in the Arabic language, if you want to extract the Future purely and remove ambiguity from it, you introduce 'Sin' or 'Sawfa' to it, so you say: 'Sa-yakun' (It will be) or 'Sawfa yakun', so the Future comes extracted and abstract. If you wish, you add a word other than this [28r], which is like your saying: 'Tomorrow' or 'After an hour' or 'In what resumes' and similar words that define the meaning of Future purely without ambiguity. Time is composed of a Body, a Quality in its rest or its movement, and the Number of the parts of its rest or the parts of its movements. Therefore, it was not a Head (Category) alongside the four preceding Categories. 'Before' and 'After' occur in Time by the relation of some of it to others. 6 - Discourse on Place (Makan): It is what answers the question 'Where?' (Ayna). You say: 'Where is Muhammad?' The answerer says: 'In the mosque' or 'In the palace' or 'In his house' and the like. Place can never be anything but a Body; nothing else is permissible. Place is composed of a body related to a body in the sense that one of the surfaces of the Place met one of the surfaces of the Situated (object), or some of them, or all of them, according to the situation of the Situated in the Place. The Situated with the Place is divided into two parts: One is that the Situated is shaped by the shape of the Place it is in. That is like every thing with fluid parts or scattered parts, inside every thing with solid parts or gathered parts. Like water in a jar; it takes the shape of the jar, such that if you represented it standing [without the jar], you would see it in the attribute of the jar itself. You see that visually if the water freezes in it after being fluid and the jar breaks. And like wheat and flour in a vessel...",

The second section is that the Place is shaped by the shape of the Situated in it. This is the reverse of the section we mentioned; it is the existence of every thing with solid or gathered parts inside every thing with fluid or scattered parts. Like the existence of a body in water or in air; its place in them is formed by its form. This is exemplified by the body of an egg or a stick you inserted into water, and the water froze around them after having been fluid; you find it shaped by the shape of what is in it, meaning formed by its form and configuration. Likewise, the existence of a stone in flour or wheat; its place is shaped by its shape. Air is a body among bodies, having six directions, accepting contraries of heat, cold, humidity, and dryness, except that since it was not colored, the sense of sight did not fall upon it, so it was not seen. You know it is a body by the movement of your hand or a fan, or if a fast horse runs with you; you find a body meeting you, which you sense with a strong sensation that no one denies except a silly ignoramus or a stubborn person. The existence of bodies situated in it—while it is a place for them—is like the existence of an aquatic animal in water. When a body [28v] moves from the place it was in within the air or water to another place, what was in its place moves to where it went—of air and water—to the place it exited from. The Void (Vacuum) is false. Its interpretation is a place in which there is no situated object. Since Place is of the category of Relation, there is no Situated except in a Place, and no Place except for a Situated. The proof of the invalidity of the Void belongs to a place other than this—except that we will indicate a sufficient part of it, God Almighty willing, to complete the discussion on the nature of Place. It is what is seen of the action of the vessel used for children's amusement called the 'Water-Thief' (Clepsydra/Pipette), and the action of the syringe (Zarraqah) and the cupping glass (Mahjamah). For by these things, heavy objects whose nature is to sink downwards are transformed from their natures to rise and ascend, to allow air or water to enter these things. If another body did not succeed the place of all that, that place would be empty. If that were so, the Void would be valid. Since that did not happen at all in any way, we knew that the Void is non-existent, there is no way to it. In this is sufficiency. If a speaker says: 'If a body necessitates...",

    "text": "...a place, and every place is a body, then every place necessitates a place forever.' He intended by this to prove that the body of the world has no end (infinite). This is corrupt sophistry. We have clarified the finiteness of the body of the Sphere and the World in the 'Book of Al-Fisal', which suffices against repeating it. However, we mention here a part of it so the purpose is completed, God willing. We only present in this book what suits its intended meaning. By the power of God and His strength, we say, and by God Almighty we are supported: The Body falls under Quantity—we measure it as we presented. The sphere of the World is a body that has appeared in actuality, so Number applies to its measurement by necessity. Number only applies to what is limited by it, meaning counted by it. We have presented that there is no Number except that it has other numbers which, if gathered, are equal to it. Equality only occurs in a finite thing by necessity. Everything upon which calculation by Number and Quantity falls is finite without doubt. Also, every number that has come out into actuality possesses parts, like half, third, and the like; and all of this necessitates finiteness with certainty. This is from the category of Relation. So the Sphere (Falak) which encompasses the whole world is finite by necessity. If a speaker says: 'Then the Sphere has a place,' it is said to him, and by God Almighty is success: Every part of it, the part adjacent to it is a place for it; other than that, it has no place at all. Its movement is circular; it does not transfer from its place, but every part becomes where the one following it was only. However, its upper surface has nothing touching it from above it in any way—neither void nor plenum. There is nothing above it: no place, no situated object, no area [29r], and imagination does not fall upon it in any way. We presented that every body has six surfaces: Up, Down, Right, Left, Front, and Back. Up and Down may occur in Relation, because there are things that are above other things. They may also not occur in the category of Relation from this perspective; for the upper surface of the Sphere is 'Up' and it has no 'Up' (above) at all, so it is not 'Down' (under) anything at all. The center of the Earth is 'Down' (Below) originally, so it is not 'Up' (Above) anything at all. The mentioned Center is a beginning from our perspective, and the upper surface of the Sphere is the end of that beginning, meaning a stopping point with no continuation beyond it. We do not mean by this proving that it has a 'beyond'; rather, we mean it is finite in measurement, having no 'beyond', no 'above', and no 'after' at all. This is our intent in saying that a preceding time did not have a time before it; we only mean it has a first beginning, so a time would have preceded. The upper surface of the Sphere is a beginning from the perspective of Universal Nature, meaning the existence of things...",

The First Creation was made [by] 'There is no god but He'. Place is composed of a Quality and a Substance with a Substance. 7 - Chapter on Position (Posture/Nasbah): Position is a valid Quality with no doubt in it. It is a type of the Species, except that they specialized the name for it. The meaning of Position is the configuration (Hay'ah) of the Situated in the Place, like his standing in it, or his sitting, kneeling, reclining, and the like. 8 - Chapter on Possession (State/Milk): Possession is a valid Relation, except that they specialized this name—meaning Milk—for what is of the Relation regarding possessing the Substance, like wealth and the like. This is the reality of Possession. It is composed of a Substance with a Substance and a Relation. However, some Ancients included in Possession your saying: 'So-and-so has a hand and a foot, and has heat,' and the like. This, according to us, is a corrupt judgment, so there is no reason to busy oneself with it, since our goal is truths and what is established by proof or part of a proof leading to knowing them. By God Almighty is success, there is no god but He. 9 - Chapter on Action (Fa'il): Action is an influence occurring from a choosing or natural body upon another body. Either it transforms it to its nature, stripping it of its type and clothing it with the type of itself; or it transforms it from some [29v] of its qualities to other qualities; or it performs an abstract action like the mover, the stander, the thinker, and the like. As for the first two parts: The first of them is like the action of fire on water and air; it strips them of the attributes of their substantial types—meaning it transforms them into fire. And like eating; it transforms the nature of what is eaten into its [the eater's] type. As for the second, it is like the action of the knife, the stone, and the cutter with them; they transform from gathering...",

And like the nature of the Elements of which the human is composed, in that every strong one among them transforms what it meets of the others to its type. This is found in everything composed of them. Every man wants to multiply himself through others in his accidents. Blessed be the Disposer, there is no god but He. Action is divided into two parts: Either an action whose trace remains after its expiration, like the action of the plowman, the carpenter, and the painter (decorator). Or an action whose trace does not remain after its expiration, like the swimmer, the walker, the speaker, and the like. The Agent (Actor) and the Patient (Affected) are composed of Substance, Substance, and Quality. 10 - Chapter on Affection (Passivity/Munfa'il): The Patient is that which is prepared to accept the action we mentioned, like the burnt and transformed by fire, the cut by the knife, the sewn by the needle, and the like. These things, even if they only exist with the assistance of others, were it not for the acceptance of influence in their natures, it would not be possible for the actor in them to do anything in them at all. If that were not so, let him sew with a spear or a banana, or burn with his breath, or cut with his foot. These objections are rioting and sophistry from the objectors who say: 'Fire did not burn, but the human burned with it; and the knife did not cut, but the human cut with it.' We wanted to clarify that the knife has a power, and in the fire likewise; were it not for them, it would not be possible for the human to perform with them an action resulting from them. Know also that the Patient influences the Action—it must be so—except that it is less influencing. For if you prolonged the will with a sharp, polished iron grip on smooth, moist parchment, that would influence the grip with length [of time] an influence appearing to anyone with the slightest sense, a clear, evident appearance. And so is every influencer in the world—do not exclude anything at all—even if it is far from your sense. With length, continuation, and the passing of successive ages, it appears clearly, even if it were the dragging of a finger on iron. So glory be to the True Influencer whom nothing influences; there is no god but He. This is a rank necessitating the existence of the Creator, the Influencer in whom [nothing] is influencing [30r] by necessity, as we explained in the Book of Al-Fisal.

Their intent by this is that Heat and Cold, if they meet something, return it to their nature; whereas Moisture and Dryness do not do that. If a speaker says: 'Moisture may moisten what it encounters, and Dryness dry what it meets,' the answer, and by God Almighty is success, is: Reliable propositions are those that are always true, not those that are true once and false another time. Not everything moistens by meeting the moist, nor does everything dry by meeting the dry. If you threw iron into water and kept it there as long as God wills it to stay, it would not become moist (liquid), nor does the water become dry due to meeting the iron. As for Heat, if it meets something, it must heat it by necessity. Likewise, the Cold does not meet anything except it cools it. By God Almighty is success. The discussion on the Ten Categories has ended, and praise be to God abundantly. D - Discourse on Other, Same (Like), Difference, Opposite, Incompatible, Opposition, Possession, and Privation, and the Interpretation of the Meanings of these Names: We presented our intent by saying 'Individual' and 'Individuals', and informed that we do not mean by that the Body alone, but every gathered, singular part of a body or an accident carried in a body. So we say: The individual of the blackness of this garment is intense or polished; the individual of the movement of this mover is from here to there; the individual of this issue is precise; and the like. This is an agreement from us so that understanding of our intent occurs thereby, God Almighty willing. People of every science and every craft must have words specific to them to express their intentions and to abbreviate many meanings.

Meaning that each one of them is 'Other' than the other. So Zayd is other than Amr; Zayd's knowledge is other than Amr's knowledge; Zayd's garment is other than Khalid's garment; Zayd's height is other than Amr's height; Khalid's whiteness is other than Muhammad's whiteness. And so are every two things also, definitively, and every two existents. The Creator Almighty is 'Other' than His creation.

It is not formable in imagination nor intelligible nor ever existent that two words whose meanings are neither different nor not-different. For it is among the most heinous impossibilities that the meaning of this name is not the meaning of this name, not the meaning of this second name, nor is it another meaning other than it. It is also among the impossible, prohibited falsehoods that the meaning of this name is the meaning of this second name while being also other than it. This leads to 'this is this' [and 'this is not this'], and this is a manifest corruption. For it is not permissible that anything be intended by the two names except one meaning or more than one. Whatever exceeds this is whispering (delusion). We praise God Almighty for what He bestowed of intellect. If a group objects with what the Ancients mentioned, that 'A thing is only other than the thing if its substance is different from its substance'—for they also said: 'The Human is the Donkey by Genus-hood', meaning they are under one genus, and they did not intend what we are discussing. What we intend is only that the thing is not other than this thing at all by its essence, or it is other than it. If a speaker says: 'Is the Part the Whole or is it other than it?' The reality is that it is other than it, because the Part may be nullified while the Whole is not nullified. If it were not other than it, it would not exist without it. 'The Whole' is merely a word by which all these parts are named in the state of their gathering. The Parts are the portions; otherwise, every part is other than the other part. The Whole is divided into two parts: One is a Whole where every part of its parts is named by the name of its Whole. That only occurs in the individuals of a Species, or in what is not composed of different things, like parts of water; all of them are named water. And parts of fire likewise. Likewise, every individual of the Universal Human is named a human. The second part is a Whole where none of its parts is named by the name of its Whole. That is in what is composed of different elements, like the organs of a human; none of them is named a human. Likewise the door; it is composed of wood and nails; the wood and nails are not named a door.

Because the Whole is only a name applying to all parts if they gather, and does not apply to any of them individually. Do you not see that [31r] the Part, if it perishes, the Whole does not perish by its perishing? Nor is it defined by the definition of its Whole. The name 'Whole' is like the name 'Human'; the hand is not a human, the head is not a human, the leg is not a human, and the stomach is not a human. But if all that gathers, the name 'Human' occurs for it then, not before that. Thus is the Whole with its parts. However, in the question, we clarify and do not leave for the confused a meaning to be confused about. So we say: Every two names do not escape one of two ways by necessity, with no third: Either they both apply to one thing, or to more than one thing. The questioned must then proceed to one of these two meanings, otherwise his interruption (silence) becomes evident. It becomes valid then that the meaning of the two words is one meaning—each of the two words expresses a single named thing—or that each of the two words expresses a meaning other than the meaning of the other word. If their meanings are different, then each one of them is other than the other. Then we return, and by God Almighty is success, and say: Then things, after Differentiation, are divided into sections: Among them are 'Similar Others' (Aghyar Amthal), like the blackness of this crow and the blackness of this garment; and like the dinar and the dinar; and everything that falls under one type of the species adjacent to individuals, whether a body or other. Among them are 'Different Others' (Aghyar Khilaf), like the dinar and the dirham; whiteness and redness; standing and reclining; and like the dinar and redness; and everything that falls under two different species or two different genera. Except that everything we mentioned, even if they are 'Different' as we said, they are also 'Similar' (Likes) from another perspective: due to their agreement in the Highest Head which is the Genus of Genera, or their agreement in Division even if a Genus of Genera does not gather them, and in Origination and Composition. As for the Creator, Mighty and Majestic, He is 'Different' (Khilaf) to His entire creation from every perspective. There is no similarity between Him Almighty and all His creation, nor between Him Almighty and anything of His creation in any way at all. The first term, which is Differentiation (Taghayur), occurs in every two named things. These two sections occur in Substances and Accidents. This second section, I mean Difference (Mukhalafah), occurs between every two existents, whether they are (1) under two different species or two different genera, or one of them is among what falls under Genera and the other among what does not fall under Genera.

The second is 'Incompatible Others' (Aghyar Mutanafiyah), like Life and Death, Rest and Motion, and the like. Opposites (Ad-dad) are every two words whose meanings share the two ends of distance (extremes), falling under one Category [31v], and having intermediates between them. Either under two different species under one genus, like Blackness and Whiteness which fall under the genus of Color. Or like Generosity and Miserliness which are two species falling under two different genera, Virtue and Vice. Or like Virtue and Vice which are two genera gathering what we mentioned, and Quality gathers them. Every two Opposites are perceived by a single sense; it is not permissible otherwise. Either they are perceived together by the Intellect, or together by Vision, and likewise Touch, Taste, and Smell. Contemplate this with your intellect and you will find it certain. Every two Opposites: if one of them is in the Soul, the second is in it also; and if one is in the Body, the second is in it also. Only this is permissible. Because Opposites also alternate upon their carrier, like Whiteness and Blackness in the body, and Forbearance and Rashness in the soul. Likewise other character traits of the soul: Knowledge and Ignorance, Justice and Injustice, Piety and Debauchery, Anger (1) and Satisfaction, and all its traits. Likewise other Opposites alternating upon the Composite Body: Heat, Cold, Dryness, and Moisture. Opposites are such that if one occurs, the other is lifted, and there are intermediates between them. The Incompatibles (Contradictories - Mutanafiyah) are what also share the two ends of distance but have no intermediates between them; and when one is lifted, the other occurs. That is like Life and Death, Gathering and Separation, Health of an organ and its Sickness, and the like. Our saying in this place \"Life and Death\" is merely looseness (lexical dispute), not verification. We only intended by that the meeting of the Soul with the Body composed of elements; in this, we expressed it as Life. And we intended by our saying Death the separation of the Soul from the mentioned Body. This Gathering and Separation are the Incompatibles. As for Life, which is Sensation and Voluntary Movement, it is essential in the Soul, never separating from the Soul. Since that is so, there is no Opposite to Life in reality, because an Opposite and its Opposite are always situated alternating upon a single thing. Likewise the Incompatibles. 'Deadness' (Inanimateness) in reality is the absence of Sensation and Voluntary Movement; this is in inanimate objects. So Death is essential to them also, not separating from them in any way. So there is no Opposite to Deadness also in...",

    "text": "...reality in this mode, nor is there an Incompatible to it, nor to Life. The Body composed of the four natures is inanimate always; it has no life in any way at all [32r]. Life belongs only to the Soul permeating it. But we were compelled to express their meeting with the mentioned Body and their separation from it as Life and Death, due to people's habit of these two expressions for these two meanings. We wanted approximation and understanding as you see. So when you see in this book of ours that Death is the opposite of Life, this is what we intended; do not think it an error from us in this meaning. Some people of Sharia said: 'Knowledge is the opposite of Death.' This is corrupt speech, because the Soul, after separating from the Body, is more firmly knowledgeable than it ever was; whereas the Composite Body knows nothing. The difference between the Incompatible (Munafi) and the Opposite (Didd) is that between two Opposites there are intermediates belonging to neither of the Opposites, like Redness, Yellowness, and Greenness between Blackness and Whiteness; and like the state of Moderation between Generosity and Miserliness, as we explain in our book on *The Ethics of the Soul* (1), God Almighty willing. The Incompatibles are those between which there are no intermediates. For Life and Death, in what they are in, have no intermediate that is neither life nor death. Likewise, the Health of an organ and its Sickness; it is not permissible for an organ to be 'healthy-sick', nor 'neither healthy nor sick'. Health is the disposal of the organ in its natural action, and Sickness is its weakness from that. Likewise Injustice with Justice and Judgment: it is not permissible for a judgment to be 'neither justice nor injustice', nor 'justice-injustice'. Since these two matters—I mean Opposition (Tadadd) and Incompatibility (Munafah)—are two different meanings, we needed two different names to express them so ambiguity does not occur. A group defined the Opposite as 'That which if it occurs, the other is lifted.' This is an error, because this statement necessitates that Reclining is the opposite of Sitting, and Greenness the opposite of Redness. This is an error; rather, this is of Difference and Differentiation, not Opposition. The definition of the Opposite in reality is what we expressed just now. As for the state of the body which negates both Opposites together, regarding some Opposites and some Incompatibles, no name is known [for it] in most places. Like the state of the soul of an infant; it is not called righteous nor wicked, nor learned nor ignorant. Rather, all these states are negated from it by the particle 'No' (La). We say: The infant does not know anything; and the name of Ignorance is not applied to him except with the possibility of Knowledge. It is said the infant is 'not righteous nor wicked'; when he grows strong and bears both matters, one of them applies to him according to what appears from him. Like the stone; it is not said to be alive nor dead, but we negate both matters from it...",

That is not necessary [by nature], but according to what exists, but it is possible mostly and imaginable—if it were—[32v] how it would be in general. It may enter into impossibility in actuality due to types of Position preventing it by habit. As for Opposition (Taqabul), it is divided into two parts: Opposition in Nature and Opposition in Speech. That which is in Speech is Affirmation and Negation. We mean by Affirmation the establishing of a thing for a thing, like your saying: 'Zayd is speaking', 'Wine is forbidden', 'Zakat is obligatory on one who owns such and such amount among Muslims', 'The world is originated', 'Muhammad is the Messenger of God', and the like. Negation is the denial of a thing from a thing, like your saying: 'Zayd is not a prince', 'Musaylimah is not a prophet', 'Usury is not lawful', 'The world is not eternal', and the like. The wording of Affirmation and Negation may come as a lie if you affirm falsehood or deny truth. The difference between Affirmation and Negation is the introduction of particles of negation, which are 'La' (No), 'Laysa' (Is not), 'Ma' (Not), or particles that make verbs jussive in Arabic—without the meaning of condition—or make them accusative, which are 'Lam' (Did not) and its sisters, 'Lan' (Will not), and the like. It becomes Negation; or removing them, so it becomes Affirmation. As for that which is in Nature, it is divided into three parts: One is the opposition of Opposites and Incompatibles. The second is the opposition of the Related (Relation). The third is the opposition of Possession and Privation (Nullity). We have spoken before on Opposites, Incompatibles, and Relation sufficiently. Know that regarding two Opposites, the stability of each is by itself; likewise the Incompatibles. As for the Related pair, the stability of each is by the stability of the other, as we explained there. Therefore, each of the Opposites does not revolve upon the other, nor do the Incompatibles. As for the Related pair, each of them revolves upon its companion; we say: 'Double of the Half' and 'Half of the Double'. But we do not say 'Injustice of Justice', nor 'Justice of Injustice', nor 'Whiteness of Blackness', nor 'Blackness of Whiteness', nor 'Evil of Good', nor 'Good of Evil'. The meaning of Opposition is the existence of two things in specific ends necessitating that one implies the existence [or negation] of the other upon the ranks we mentioned; so it is as if one opposes the other. As for the opposition of Possession and Privation, that is like Sight (1) and its lack which is Blindness. For one of these revolves upon...",

The meaning of revolving is Relation; so we say 'Blindness of Sight' (blindness regarding sight), but we do not say 'Sight of Blindness'. Know that Possession is what does not revolve upon Privation—meaning it is not related to it—while Privation revolves upon Possession—meaning it is related to it (1). Privation (Nullity) is not a 'meaning', but the departure of a thing and its annulment. Nothing is counted as 'lacking' (privative) except what bears the possibility of the existence of what it lacks. Do you not see that the stone is not called 'blind' (lacking sight)? This was a meaning with us [33r] in which the Greek language was followed. As for the Arabic language, every state in which something is not present, the name of 'privation' of that thing is applied to it, whether it existed before that or not. Likewise, everything that 'is not' is called Privation (Non-existence) in it, whether its existence is imagined or not. However, the difference between Opposites and between Privation and Existence is that both Opposites have 'Iyyah' (Is-ness/Being)—meaning they are existent—and Existence has 'Iyyah'—meaning it is existent—while Privation has no 'Iyyah', meaning it has no existence. Know that Affirmation and Negation occur only in Propositions (Reports), and thereby Truth and Falsehood exist. The Philosophers mentioned here a thing (2) they called 'Being of a thing in a thing'. It is hardly limitable according to us, even if it is limited in Nature. We saw no reason to busy ourselves with it, as it is merely splitting hairs; such as their saying: The Species is in the Genus, and the Genus is in the Species, and the like, which has no power in perceiving truths, establishing proofs, and the quality of inference which is our goal in this book. They also mentioned a thing they described as 'Being of a thing with a thing' (Simultaneity). They arranged it into three parts: One is the being of a thing with a thing in Time; this is the familiar usage in language, since every two things in one time are 'together', meaning each is with the other. They also arranged in that the being of two Related things with one another, meaning with the half is the double, and with the double is the half. They also arranged in that the being of two Species together under one Genus, meaning equal in it, like the horse and donkey under the genus of Animal. All these parts return to Time and do not exit from it. They mentioned a thing they called 'Anteriority' (Qidam). This is a word used by the people of the Arabic language for what precedes the time of another...",

As for the Theologians (Mutakallimun), they used it in reporting about creatures and the Creator Almighty, so they named the First One, Mighty and Majestic, 'Old' (Qadim). We prevent that and refuse it, and we do not remove 'Old' (Qadim) and 'Oldness' (Qidam) from their places in the Arabic language, nor do we describe the Creator, Mighty and Majestic, with it at all. He, Mighty and Majestic, said: 'Like the old date-stalk' (36 Ya-Sin: 39), meaning the worn-out one over which different times have passed by their prolongation. We place in the stead of this expression the word 'The First' (Al-Awwal), and the report that He, Almighty, never ceased to be, and that all other than Him—which are all creatures—were not, then were; and that everything other than Him Almighty is originated, created; and He is a Creator, First, One, Truth; there is no god but He. The Ancients mentioned things in 'Anteriority' that are not correct. Among them: 'The Genus is anterior to the Species by Nature' [33v], because it is mentioned in rank before it. This has no meaning because the Genus is the sum of its Species themselves; so a thing cannot be anterior to itself, nor is it permissible for the Whole to be anterior to its Parts. They also mentioned that 'The Introduction to Sciences is anterior to Sciences'. This is an error because Science exists in Nature—meaning in potentiality therein—before the entrant enters to seek it. They also mentioned 'Anteriority of Honor'. This is completely corrupt, unless it was in the Greek language. Some were deceived regarding this by the Arabic language in their saying: 'Faras 'Atiq' (Noble Horse), meaning old (Qadim). It is not so, because 'Atq' in Arabic is among Homonymous names; it applies to the Old, as in 'Old Wine'; and applies to the Good/Beautiful, as in 'Atiq al-Wajh' (Noble/Beautiful of face), and 'So-and-so has apparent nobility ('itq)', meaning apparent beauty. Upon this meaning they said 'Noble Horse'. It also applies to Freedom from ownership, so they say: 'So-and-so freed ('ataqa) his slave', and 'The slave is freed ('atiq)', meaning absolved from ownership. As for Cause and Effect (Ma'lul), it belongs to the category of Relation. It is not permissible for the Cause to precede the Effect at all. If it preceded it, there would be a time when it was not necessitating it; if that were so, it would not be a Cause...",

E - Chapter of Discourse on Motion (Harakah): Motion is divided into six parts: The first two parts are the motions of Generation (Kon) and Corruption (Fasad), which are in Substance. The meaning of Generation: \"Its exit from Possibility and Non-existence to Necessity and Existence.\" This is a motion for the emerging Substance, not for its Originator who brought it forth, Mighty and Majestic. The meaning of Corruption: \"Its exit from Existence and Necessity to Nullity and Non-existence.\" That is necessary in Accidents, and imaginable regarding Bodies if their Creator Almighty wills what He wills of them. Corruption, according to us in reality, is the separation of the body into many things, the departure of its accidents, and the occurrence of other accidents upon it. As for all Bodies (Matter), their essences are never non-existent in any way, but they transfer from attribute to attribute as He Almighty said: {Creation after creation} (39 Az-Zumar: 6), and from place to place, and from world to world, until the worshipped among them settle in the Abode of Bliss or Torment in the World of Recompense without end. These two motions occur in all Accidents because they are generating and corrupting. Then two other parts are the motion of Growth (Rabw) and Diminution (Idmihlal) [34r], and they belong to Quantity. Growth is: \"The distancing (1) of the limits of the body from its center.\" Diminution is: \"The approaching of the limits of the body to its center.\" These two only exist in Growing things. Growth is by food transforming into their type and spreading from their center to their extremities. Diminution is by the taking of a part of its moistures, more than what the body accepts of food. You see the tree, the animal, and the composite plant feed, so the food transforms into parts of the fed. In the animal, it transforms into blood, flesh, fat, bone, veins, arteries, nerves, hair, bristles, feathers, and skin; so that body extends, lengthens, widens, and bulges. Food for the tree transforms—from water and moistures of the earth and manure—into wood, bark, leaves, flowers, taste, gum, fronds, and twigs; and it extends and grows big as we mentioned.

Then when all that begins to diminish due to the end of its matter which its Creator arranged for it—from the moistures of the bodies we mentioned being [consumed] more than what it accepts of food—until the tree and plant dry up, the animal dies, its parts separate, and its soul returns to its world. This is the world in which we witnessed the Truthful One sent from the Creator Almighty, the Prophet, peace be upon him, during his journey and disposal in the world of the Spheres by the Divine Power specialized for him. It is what is between the beginning of the Spheres, which is the Sphere of the Moon, and the limit of the farthest of the four elements. May God grant us therein success, salvation, and rest, and save us from what the sinful rebels fall into. The rest of the bodily elements separate to their resting place which He Almighty arranged them in, until He gathers them all on the Day of Resurrection and returns them as He began them; there is no god but He. The parts of trees and plants also separate to their resting place of the four elements which are Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. So glory be to the Originator, the Composer, the Perfecter, the Disposer; there is no god but He. {Indeed in that is a sign for a people who know} (27 An-Naml: 52). {And how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they, therefrom, are turning away} (12 Yusuf: 105). Then two remaining parts are Alteration (Istihala) and Locomotion (Naqla). Alteration is like the transformation of wine into vinegar; for the wine did not grow nor diminish, nor did its essence nor the essence of the vinegar originate [from nothing], nor did either of them cease to exist, nor did it move from place to place. Likewise the transformation of fire to air, air to fire, and some elements to others. We may find a square increase by a square, so it grows and increases but does not alter from squareness. As for Locomotion, it is [34v] the general, apparent motion, which is the change of places. These two parts are Quality. The incompatible of every motion is the Rest of the mover by it; so Rest in general is incompatible with Motion in general. Spatial Locomotion is divided into two parts: Voluntary and Natural. Voluntary is divided into two parts: One is the Creator Almighty moving what He wills of the bodies of the atmosphere where He wills Almighty—of wind, rain, and the like. It is a motion residing in the mentioned things and an influence in them. The second is the Soul moving what it possesses of bodies up and down, forward and backward, right and left; and the moving of every choosing body by its nature. Natural is divided into three parts: Motion from the center, meaning Up, like Fire and Air...",

If the intent in naming were to report that he is a servant of God, it would be [true] for Abdullah too, and you would be lying in your negation that he is 'Abdullah' [if denying servitude], and the one naming him Abdullah in testifying about him and reporting about him would be truthful, and there is no doubt in his lying [if the name is just a proper noun but the attribute is false]. What we mentioned is correct, and by God Almighty is success. It has appeared by the truth we explained that Descriptions and Reports all fall upon the Named Things (Meanings), not upon the Names, and that the Named Things are the Meanings, and Names are expressions for them. It is established by this that the Name is other than the Named. The error of those who thought otherwise among our companions who speak on Theology (Kalam) without verifying it—that the Name is the Named—has become clear. Some of them argued for their error with the saying of God Almighty: {Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High} (87 Al-A'la: 1). This is a severe lapse from them. The explanation of that is that since there was no way to report about Named Things at all except by the mediation of expressions agreed upon for them, the Named Things were made the essence of those expressions, while the intent is [the entity] expressed by them. Since there was no way to praise God Almighty except by mentioning the Name expressing Him, one could not effectuate Praise, Commendation, and Glorification for Him Almighty except by the mediation of the Name. So He commanded us Almighty with what we are capable of, not what we are not capable of at all. The intent of Glorification is He Almighty, not the perishable, interrupted sound, non-existent after its existence, falling under the limit of Quantity in the type of Speech, as we presented. So know this. Among Names are Definite ones, which are Particulars, like your saying: Zayd, Amr, the man you know, Zayd's servant, the man's servant, my servant. And among them are Indefinite ones, which are Generals, like your saying: A man, a donkey. The Names that substitute for them are known in languages; some for the specific speaker (1), some for the present addressee, some for the one reported about (absent), and some for the one pointed [35v] to, like your saying: I, You, He, This.

The Ancients said: It indicates a specific time, because you say 'Sahha' (Past), 'Yasihhu' (Future/Present), so he is 'Sahih'. This is a report about his state Now, and that is a past and future action. This Verb (Kalima) is a sound established by agreement also, as we presented regarding the Noun; some of its parts do not indicate its meaning, except that it indicates a resident (static) time as we mentioned. They mentioned regarding your saying \"Health\" (Sihhah) that it is a Noun, not a Verb (Kalima). This is what Grammarians call the Infinitive/Source (Masdar). In reality, it is a name for safety from illnesses, except that it is divided into two parts: One is an action of an actor and a movement of a mover, like 'Beating' (Darb) from the Beater. The other is a description of a described, like 'Health' for the Healthy; it is carried in him and is one of his attributes. As for 'Healthy' and 'Beater', they are names of the one free from illness and the one moving by beating; they deserved them by their predicate and influence. We only mentioned these two words because they are the Subject of the Report and its Predicate, so they are two parts of the Report. Likewise, your saying 'Fa'ala' (Did) and 'Qa'ada' (Sat) are things established to express the influence appearing from bodies or in them. They are also part of the parts of the Report, like your saying: 'Zayd stood' (Qama Zayd), or your saying: 'Zayd is healthy' and 'Abdullah is departing'. The Report stands on two names: one is a name distinguishing the Reported About from others, which is the Subject (Mawdu'); and the second is a description distinguishing the Report About Him from others, which is the Predicate (Mahmul). 3 - Discourse on Speech (Statement/Qawl): The Ancients intended by the word 'Qawl' here every Report standing by itself. The least of that is a Noun and a Description (Verb/Adjective) as we presented. The mentioned Report: every part of it indicates a part of its meaning, contrary to single words. If you said 'Muhammad is a Prophet', 'Muhammad' indicated to you part of your intent by your saying: 'Muhammad is a Prophet'. The Report has followers which the Ancients named \"Adjuncts\" (Lawahiq) and \"Connectives\" (Rubut). Adjuncts are things added for clarification and emphasis, like your saying: 'The good mind belongs to Zayd', and 'The long, good hair [36r] belongs to So-and-so', and 'The people, all of them, came to me'. For your saying 'The good mind' are two names by which completion is not achieved, like your saying 'Zayd is standing'. The gathering of these two incomplete words was not like the judgment of gathering the two by which the meaning is completed. The Alif and Lam entering the Arabic language for definition, or what stands in their place in other languages, are among the Adjuncts...",

    "text": "...also, because all that is an explanation attached to the explained; therefore, these were named 'Adjunct Additions'. As for Connectives (Rubut), they are what Grammarians call 'Particles' (1) in meaning. They are words established for meanings connecting Noun and Noun, Noun and Description, and Reported About and Report. Like your saying: 'Zayd is in the house', and 'Zayd did not stand'. They are like prepositions such as: In (Fi), About ('An), From (Min), and others; and like particles of interrogation such as: Is (Hal), How (Kayfa), and the like. For you say: 'Did Zayd stand?' And likewise other particles connecting meanings. The benefit of these particles in expression is great, so their meanings in the language should be cultivated, as expression is not complete except with them, and they substitute for much lengthiness. Do you not see that you say 'Your brothers and your uncles came to me'? Were it not for the 'Waw' (And), you would need to isolate each of the two sentences and report about it that they came to you. A Statement (Qawl) may be composed of two words and not be complete, like your saying: 'If you come to me', or 'When Zayd dies'. If you said 'If you come to me, I will honor you', it would be [complete] speech. Or 'If Zayd dies, his movement ceases', it would be complete speech. The Report, as we presented, is either Affirmation or Negation. The Affirmation is either false or true, and the Negation is likewise. If the Report is complete as we mentioned, it is called a Proposition (Qadiyya). It is either true or false. Memorize this and remember it, for it will pass by you often, God Almighty willing. The Negative and Affirmative Proposition each is divided (2) into two parts: Either Suspended by a condition (Conditional) or Categorical (Cutting). The Conditional is like your saying: 'Whoever changes his religion to other than Islam, killing becomes necessary for him'; and your saying: 'If it is moving by will, it is alive'; and your saying: 'When the sun sets, it is night'. Know that 'Mata' (When), 'Ma' (What/Whatever), 'Idha ma' (Whenever), and all these particles—their ruling is one in conditioning and suspending the Predicate on the Subject therein. If you want to make these propositions with a wording of negation, you say: 'Whoever changes his religion, it is not permissible to spare him unless he accepts Islam'; 'If it is moving by will, it is not dead' [36v]; and 'If the sun sets, it is not day'. As for the Categorical, it is that you say: 'Every human is a substance', or that you say: 'The five prayers are obligatory on whoever is addressed by them'. Negation is by inserting 'La' (No), 'Laysa' (Is not), 'Ma' (Not), or...",

    "text": "...the particles we mentioned that make verbs jussive without condition or make them accusative. If you insert one of these particles on a false proposition, the negation becomes true. 'A god other than God' [exists] is a false proposition; 'There is no god but God' is true. If you insert these particles on a true proposition, you would be lying. This is what the Ancients named 'Privation and Affirmation' (Salb wa Ijab), because these particles strip (negate) what you affirmed in your wording upon which you inserted them. For every Affirmative there is one Negative, and that is only by inserting a particle of negation particles we mentioned or removing it only. By God Almighty is success. Know that every proposition where an exception occurs in the first of its knot (structure) is Conditional. The Conditional is of two types: Either Conjunctive (Muttasil) or Separating Disjunctive (Muqassim Fasil). The Conjunctive is what necessitates the connection of a thing to another thing that only exists by its existence. It is of two types: Either Affirmative like your saying: 'If the sun sets, it is night', or Negative (1) like your saying: 'If the sun does not rise, it is not day'. Do you not see that you connected the existence of day [to the existence] of sunrise and linked it to it, and connected the existence of night [to the existence] of sunset and linked it to it? As for the Separating Disjunctive, it is what comes with a wording of doubt—even if it is not doubt—but is a judgment for the Subject with one of the divisions of Predicates. That is like your saying: 'The world is either originated or eternal'. If you wish, you bring the word 'Aw' (Or); except that the word 'Imma' (Either), if you cut and divide, is clearer than the word 'Aw'. If you are deciding interrogatively, if you wish you bring the word 'Am' (Or/Is it), and if you wish the word 'Aw'. You say: 'Is the world originated or (Aw) eternal?' If you wish you say: 'Or (Am) eternal?'. The divisions of this type—I mean the Disjunctive—may be more than two parts. That depends on the division fulfilling all that it bears in the mind. This is a place where error becomes great if a flaw or lack occurs in the division. So guard against it with extreme caution. If you are questioned, contemplate: Did your questioner leave out a part of the parts of his question? Alert to it, for you must err by necessity if you answer [an incomplete division]. If you are a questioner, do not satisfy yourself with this, for it is of the ignorant or those of base character who mislead their opponents, satisfied with overcoming the moment without perceiving truths. Know [37r] that if the Predicate is one and the Subjects are many, they are many propositions, like your saying: 'The Angel, Man, and Jinn are living'. These are three propositions. And if...",

    "text": "...the Subject is one and the Predicates are many, it is one proposition [containing many], like your saying: 'The soul of man is living, rational, mortal, shining upon a body accepting color, upright in stature.' If you separated all that, they would be different propositions. Know that speech is not called a Proposition until it is complete, whether long or short. Like your saying: 'The human composed of a body accepting color and a living rational mortal soul moves his hand with a body having a sharp tip, and in its tip is a fluid body differing from the color of the surface of the body in his hand, writing on that surface lines whose meanings are understood.' All this is equal to your saying: 'A writing human.' Know that propositions are either Binary—which is composed of a Subject and Predicate as we presented—or more than Binary, which is adding an attribute or a time. You say: 'Muhammad was yesterday a minister', and 'Amr is a rational man'. You may also add to this by adding another benefit, which is adding to the proposition: either its Necessity inevitably, or its Possibility, or that it is Impossible to be. If you add to the proposition—which is Reported About and Report—another attribute as we mentioned, that is permissible. The addition you added becomes your goal in the Report; meaning it becomes the Predicate and the Report together, and the Predicate and Subject—which were the Reported About and the Report together—become Subject and Reported About only. Like your saying: 'Zayd is departing'. If you added and said: 'The departing Zayd is generous', or 'Zayd is a generous departer', then your saying 'Zayd is departing' becomes a Subject—meaning Reported About—and your saying 'Generous' becomes the Predicate, meaning it is the Report. The same applies to Negation with no difference. Know that propositions are either Indefinite (Neglected/Muhmala), Singular (Makhsusa), or Quantified (Dhawatu Aswar). The Singular is what is a report about a single person or specific individuals, not about their entire species by negation or affirmation. Like your saying: 'Zayd is not departing', 'Your brothers are not generous', 'So-and-so is a Caliph', and 'Amr is alive'. Know that this section which we named Singular, no general demonstration rises from it; so guard against that. The explanation of this saying will come in the book following this book, God Almighty willing. As for the Quantified, they are divided into two parts in Affirmation and two parts in Negation. The two parts of Affirmation are either Universal or Particular. The Universal is what occurred with a word of [37v] generality, like your saying: 'All' (Kull), or 'Entire' (Jami'), or 'Not one [is not]', and the like. The Particular is what occurred with a word of...",

The two parts of Negation are inserting negation particles upon these two parts. These names [which] give certain Generality or certain Partiality are named 'Walls' (Quantifiers/Aswar) because they are like the wall surrounding it in its circle or other shape. From this—I mean the Quantified—the correct Demonstration rises, as will come after this, God Almighty willing. By them occurs the compulsion by which truths become clear. Like your saying: '[Every] human is living', and 'All people are living', or 'Not one of humans is braying', and 'Not one of humans is neighing'. Or your saying: 'Some people are writers', or 'A faction of Muslims are doctors', and the like. And like your saying in negation: 'Not some people are stones' (Some people are not stones), and the like. As for the Indefinite (Neglected/Muhmala), it is that which has none of the Quantifiers we mentioned. In the Arabic language, the Indefinite may substitute for the Quantified. That is because it is a word applying to the Genus or Species, like your saying: 'The Living (Animal) is sensing', or 'Man is living'. This word, if you do not mean a specific one by it, there is no difference between your saying 'Man is living' and your saying 'Every man is living'. The truth in that, upon strong examination, is that you contemplate the Indefinite proposition and look at its predicate. If it cannot be but general, the Subject is Universal. If it cannot be general, the proposition is Particular. What clarifies this is that if you uttered the Indefinite and said: 'Man is a rational mortal animal', 'Man is laughing', no one would deny that. But if you said: 'Man is a doctor in actuality', 'Man is a weaver in actuality', every listener would deny that upon you and call you a liar, because the attribute is particular. Likewise, if you said: 'Doctors are do-gooders', every listener would call you a liar because 'Doctors' is general, and 'Do-gooders' are [only] some doctors without doubt. When you carried a particular attribute upon the Indefinite, souls denied it. Know that the Quantifier is only permissible to be placed before the Subject—meaning before the Reported About—not before the Predicate, which is the Report. Because if you said: 'Every human is living', you spoke truth. If you said: 'Human is every living', you lied. It is only permissible to join the Universal Quantifier with the Predicate if it is a Definition or Description, like your saying: 'The soul of man is every living rational [thing] thereof possessing a colored body'. Or if you said: 'Man is every laughing [thing]'. Or if the Quantifier is Particular, like your saying: 'Man is some living [thing]'.",

This is called in Laws (Shari'ah): 'The Obligatory and Binding'. Or Possible (Mumkin), which is what may differ and may not differ (may be or may not be), like our expectation that it rains tomorrow and the like. This is called in Law: 'The Lawful and Permissible'. Or Impossible (Mumtani'), which is what there is no way to, like a human remaining under water for a full day, or living a month without eating, or walking in the air without a trick, and the like. These are what, if they appear from a human, we know he is a Prophet. This section is called in Laws: 'The Forbidden and Prohibited'. Then the Possible is divided into three parts with no fourth: Close Possible, like the possibility of rain falling when clouds thicken in the months of Kanun (December/January), and the victory of a large number of brave men over a small number of cowards. Far Possible, like the defeat of a large number of brave men by a small number of cowards, and like a cupper becoming Caliph, and the like. Pure Possible (Equal), where its two ends are equal, like a standing man: either he walks or [sits], and the like. Likewise, we find this middle section in Laws divided into three parts: Permissible Recommended (Mustahabb), Permissible Disliked (Makruh), and Level Permissible (Mustawin) having no inclination to either direction. As for the Permissible Recommended, it is that which if you do it you are rewarded, and if you leave it you do not sin nor are rewarded, like praying two Rak'ahs as voluntary worship. As for the Permissible Disliked, it is that which if you do it you do not sin nor are rewarded, and if you leave it you are rewarded; that is like eating while reclining and the like. As for the Level Permissible, it is that which [if] you do it or leave it, you do not sin nor are rewarded; that is like dyeing your clothes whatever color you wish, and riding whatever mount you wish, and the like. The wording expressing the Possible may come in ways: Some of it comes with the wording of Affirmation, like your saying: 'It is possible that this sick person dies'. It may come with the wording of Doubt, so you say: 'This sick person either dies or lives', and 'This pomegranate is either sweet or sour'. It may come...",

Know that every Possible, you describe it with two contraries together: one in Potentiality and the other in Actuality. Like your saying: 'The sitter is a stander'—meaning he is sitting in Actuality, standing in Possibility. Know that the Necessary is before the Possible, because the Necessary is the Existent, while the Possible has not come yet. As for the Impossible, it is false because it does not exist nor appear. Know that the Necessary is divided into two parts: One [38v] is what was known before its being that it must be, like the rising of the sun tomorrow, or everything that has always been inherent and necessary since it existed, like the inherence of composition to bodies. The second is what was, before necessity, not decided that it would be, like the recovery of the sick or his death. Know that the Impossible is divided into four parts: One is Relative Impossibility. It is either in a time and not a time, or in a place and not a place, or from a substance and not a substance, or in a state and not a state. Like the necessity of elephants being widespread in India and their being, until now, impossible to be widespread in the land of the Slavs. And like the necessity of beardlessness during a person's fulfilling fourteen years, or the impossibility of a beard in that period, and its necessity after its existence. And like the necessity of a man—who is not breathing his last nor fainting—lifting light pounds, and the impossibility of his carrying a thousand pounds. And like the impossibility of the weak carrying five hundred pounds, and the necessity of the strong carrying them. And like the possibility of the intelligent diving into obscurities and creating good poetry, and the impossibility of that from the stupid, dull (1), idiotic nature. This is one aspect. The second is Habitually Impossible definitively. It is formable in the soul's sense and its place—if it were, how it would be—like the transformation of inanimate objects into animals, the invention of bodies without generation, and the speech of inanimate objects. This section is by which the Prophethood of the Prophet, peace be upon him, is validated if it appears from him, while there is no way to it for others. The third is Rationally Impossible, like a man being standing and sitting in one state, and like a body being in two places, and like the transformation of the Eternal into originated or the Originated into eternal, or the existence of many eternal things. This generally includes everything that contradicts the Primaries known by Primary Reason. This is what there is no way to its existence at all, nor does the Creator ever do it, nor does it happen at all.

The fourth is Absolute (Unrestricted) [Impossibility], like every question necessitating a change in the Essence of the Creator. This is the Impossible that contradicts itself and its beginning invalidates its end. This is like the question of one who asks: Can God Almighty create His like? And similar to this. Know it, for it does not happen primarily at all. Know that there is no division for the propositions of the world other than what we mentioned at all. The word expressing the Necessary may come with the wording of Negation and with the wording of Affirmation. The word expressing the Impossible may come with the wording of Negation and may also come with the wording of Affirmation. There is no way for them to come with a wording of doubt. You say: 'It is necessary that the sun rises tomorrow', and 'It is impossible that it does not rise tomorrow'. And you say: 'It is necessary that cold is not found in fire', and 'It is impossible [39r] that cold is found in fire'. A group said the Elements are two: Necessary and Impossible only. They said: There is no Possible at all, because the thing you call Possible is Impossible before its existence, and after its existence it is Necessary; so there is no third. They said: What is absent from us is either in God's knowledge that it will be, or that it will not be. If God Almighty knew it will be, it is now Necessary to be. If He Almighty knew it will not be, it is now Impossible to be. We say: This is a corrupt judgment. As for their argument now that a thing before its being is Impossible, it is an error; rather, in Potentiality and in Conjecture, perhaps it has been and perhaps it has not been. As for their argument by God's knowledge, God Almighty has commanded and forbidden. If the thing God commanded were not yet imagined to be in the commanded person, there would be no meaning to the Command. The imagined-to-be is the Possible. Actions of choosing agents before their being fall into the section of Possible, contrary to actions of Nature. Then we say: Sense and Reason have established that there is a difference between the walking of the sitter who is healthy in limbs and body, not prevented, and the walking of the paralyzed whose legs are invalidated. This is a difference between the Possible and the Impossible. Likewise, there is a clear difference between the sitting of the healthy person we mentioned—who if he wills leaves it, he leaves it—and the sitting of the paralyzed who if he sought his utmost to leave it, he could not.

He should throw himself into fires if it is in the Unseen that he will not burn, so it is Impossible that he burns. It implies for our opponent that his preparation, thought, and striving in defending himself against cold, thirst, and harm is like his preparation to stop the movement of the Sphere or to prevent the sun from rising. We only debate people to return them to the mandate of Reason or Sense, or to compel them to exit the ranks of Reason and [enter] the stubborn denial of Sense. If they exit to what we mentioned, they have spared us the trouble with them. It becomes obligatory on us to turn away from them and leave them wishing for delusions and rejoicing in falsehoods like drunkards and children deceived by their states, happy with their actions. We busy ourselves with what is obligatory on us of clarifying truths to those seeking them. We only speak with rational, distinguishing souls, not with tongues only, nor with silly souls. 5 - Discourse on Affirmation and Privation (which is Negation), its Ranks and Aspects: The Negation that provides a meaning, and by which you negate what your opponent affirmed, its rule is to be for the Predicate, not [39v] for the Subject. Because you establish the Name then affirm an attribute for it or negate it from it. If you negated the Subject—which is the Name reported about—you would not obtain a meaning to report about. Like your saying: 'Not Zayd is departing' (La Zayd Munṭaliq); because the appearance of this wording is the negation of Zayd and the negation of departing with him. The Ancients call such a thing 'An Infinite (Indefinite) Proposition' (Ghayr Muhassala). The correct way is to say: 'Zayd is other than departing' (Ghayr Muntaliq) or 'is not departing' (Laysa Munṭaliqan). Thus, you would have established Zayd and negated departing from him. The Ancients call this a 'Metathetic Proposition' (Ma'dulah) and 'Changed in the Predicate' because you changed it from Affirmation. So be guarded in this place. The least in that is that you answer one of the two aspects of speech—which are either negating the Reported About entirely or negating the Attribute from it—so you become an answerer before verifying the question and correcting it, thus deficiency of understanding and injustice in judgment stick to you. If you want to negate what your opponent affirmed with a complete, correct negation, you must [know] that you only want to refute some of it or refute all of it. If you want to refute some of it, clarify that. And if...",

The first is: The Subject in what he affirmed and in what you negated must be one. If it is two, chaos (sophistry) occurs. That is like a speaker saying: 'The Existent is originated (Muhdath)', and the other says: 'The Existent is not originated'. This is a corruption in the structure of speech, and neither speech is a refutation of the other, because the Creator, Mighty and Majestic, is Existent and is not originated, while the World is existent and is originated. Something like this happened to our companions among the Sunnis and the Mu'tazila; they engaged in much dispute and discussion until they accused each other of disbelief. The Mu'tazila said: 'The Quran is created', meaning the knowledge of the Creator, Mighty and Majestic. The second: The Predicate which one of you affirmed must be the [same] Predicate the other negated, not another at all. That is like a speaker saying: 'Zayd is knowledgeable ('Alim)', and the opponent says: 'Zayd is not knowledgeable'. If one meant knowledgeable in Grammar and the other meant knowledgeable in Jurisprudence, their propositions do not contradict. The third: The part of the Subject upon which the judgment settled must be one in both propositions, not another. Like a speaker saying: 'Zayd is black', meaning black of hair, and the other says: 'Zayd is not black', meaning the [skin] color or the eye. The fourth: The part of the Predicate in the two propositions must be one, not different. Like a speaker saying: 'Zayd is weak', and the other says: 'Zayd is not weak'. One means weakness of the body by general constitution, and the other negates weakness of the body by disease which is a part of the parts of [40r] weakness. The fifth: The Time in which one of them affirmed what he affirmed must be the Time in which the other negated what he affirmed, this and no other. Like a speaker saying: 'Zayd is a writer'—meaning has written [in the past or potentially]—and [the other] says: 'Zayd is not writing now'. The sixth: The State (Condition) in which he affirmed what he affirmed must be the State in which the other negated what he affirmed, this and no other. Like a speaker saying: 'The infant is a knight (rider)', meaning in potentiality and capability in constitution, and the other says: 'The infant is not a knight', meaning in actuality in the state of infancy. The seventh: The relation of the thing he affirmed and the relation of the thing his opponent negated must be to one thing, not to two things. Like a speaker saying: 'Zayd is a servant ('Abd)', and the other says: 'Zayd is not a servant'. One means to God Almighty, and the other means negating that he is owned by a human. Similar to that: 'The sword cuts', and your opponent: 'The sword does not cut', one meaning this meat, and the other meaning this stone. The eighth: The two propositions must be...",

They are both reporting about a sitter in a sailing ship; he is moving by accident—meaning by the ship's moving him—while he is not moving by his essence, rather he is static. In general, inspect your opponent's speech. If in your speech which you want to affirm or negate there is a meaning contradicting what he judged with affirmation or negation, clarify it. Do not contradict anything of his meanings except with the particle of negation only; otherwise, you would be a riotous obstructor or an ignoramus. These are the conditions of the Contradictory (Naqid). Universal Negation—which is your negating the attribute from the entire species, or your negating the entire attribute from some of the species—you utter [it] with a wording whose appearance resembles the Particular. Because if you wanted Universal Negation, which is General, you said: 'Not one of humans is neighing', 'Not any of humans is neighing', 'Not one of horses is speaking', and 'No speech is in this horse'. Particular Negation, which is your negating the attribute from some of the species not all of it, you utter with a particular wording and with a universal wording. Because you say: '[Not] some people are writers [?]' (1). The meaning of these two wordings is one with no difference; the appearance of one is Generality and the appearance of the second is Particularity. Universal Affirmation, which is your affirming the attribute for the entire species, is only with a universal wording: either with a Quantifier as we presented, or Indefinite intended for Generality. Like your saying: 'Every human is living', or 'All people are living', or you say 'Human is living' and you do not mean a specific single person, or you say 'People are living' and you do not mean some of them. Particular Affirmation, which is your affirming the attribute for some of the species, is never except with a particular wording, like your saying: 'Some people are writers'. Understand this rank and be firm in it. Some [40v] of the predecessors said that if a speaker brings an Indefinite proposition saying: 'Human is a writer', the first thing coming to the soul is that his intent by that is some of the species, not all of it. As for us, we say: This saying is incorrect. These Indefinites—meaning words that come in the language sometimes for the whole species, sometimes for the single person, and sometimes for a group of the species—if the speaker using them does not clarify that he intended a single person of the species, or some of the species excluding some, or if a necessary or accepted or agreed-upon demonstration between opponents is not established for that, it is not permissible to carry it upon the generality of the entire species because words...",

It is not permissible to task the addressee with understanding some of what the word necessitates without the rest, since [that] is not in the power of nature at all. Rather, this is of the Impossible to which there is no way, and of the category of divination, unless by agreement between them or additional clarification. Otherwise, it is sophistry, rioting, and prolongation with what does not benefit nor verify a meaning. Some predecessors named the speaker's saying: 'Every human is living', and the opponent's saying: 'Not every human is living', as 'Contrary' (Didd). And they named the speaker's saying: 'Every human is living', and the other's saying: 'Not some people are living' (No human is living/Some people are not living - context suggests contradictories), as 'Contradictory' (Naqid). He mentioned that the Contradictory is stronger in disparity than the Contrary. He argued saying that the first two propositions which we named Contrary are both Universal; one is Affirmative and the other is Negative. The other two propositions which we named Contradictory, one is Universal and the second is Particular; one is Affirmative and the second is Negative. The first two only differed in one direction which is Quality only—meaning Affirmation and Negation—while they agree in Quantity—meaning both are Universal. The other two differed in two directions: One is Quality, meaning Affirmation and Negation like the difference of the Contrary proposition; and the second is Quantity, meaning one is Universal and the second is Particular. He said: What differed in two directions is more disparate than what differed in one direction. We say: This is an error. The speaker only observed the appearance of the wording without the reality of the meaning. This speaker's judgment, even if truthful in the number of aspects of difference, is a false judgment regarding the intensity of difference. Had he said: 'It was stronger [or] more', it would have been true. Rather, we say: That which is called Contrary, we call 'General Negation' or if you wish 'General Contradictory'; [it is] more disparate than [41r] the other which we call 'Specific Contradictory' or if you wish 'Specific Negation'. Because the speaker of the first negated all that the other affirmed and belied him in all he narrated, leaving no meaning of the meanings of his proposition except he opposed him in it and disparated him in all of it. As for the second, its speaker only negated some of what the other affirmed and withheld from the rest of the proposition; he did not negate it nor affirm it, nor did he oppose him in it nor agree with him. He only disparated him in part of his proposition, not in all of it. The disparater in all is stronger in opposition than the disparater in part. If your opponent brings you an Indefinite premise, decide with him its meaning: Did he intend Generality or Specificity? Meaning, does he carry it on the Whole or some of what the word he spoke necessitates?",

    "text": "Guard against neglecting this chapter. If you judge a proposition and your opponent negates it, contemplate: If what you affirmed and he negated is of those having intermediates, verify with him to clarify what he intended. Like your saying: 'Zayd is white', and he says: 'Zayd is not white'. It does not bind him by this saying that Zayd is black; perhaps he intended that he is red or yellow. An example of this in Laws (Sharia) is that you say: 'Such matter is forbidden (Haram)', and your opponent says: 'It is not forbidden'; or you say: 'Such matter is obligatory (Wajib)', and your opponent says: 'It is not obligatory'. In his saying 'It is not forbidden', it does not bind him that it is obligatory; nor in his saying 'It is not obligatory' that it is forbidden. Rather, perhaps he intended that it is merely permissible (Mubah). As for those without intermediates, do not care (1) about this. Because if you said: 'Zayd is living', and your opponent said: 'He is non-living', he has necessitated that he is dead by necessity, and there is no intermediate here. Death is bound to him by his saying. Look, the meaning of Negation may be in the wording of Affirmation, except that this is not a general condition the soul trusts, but is in one place and not another. Because you say: 'So-and-so is dead', and your opponent says: 'So-and-so is writing' or 'So-and-so is alive'; this is a correct meaning in negating death, but do not trust this. For if you said: 'So-and-so is reclining', and your opponent says: 'So-and-so is sitting', you might both be lying if the reported about is standing. The reality of Negation is where one is true and the other is false. If you want the reality of Negation and the removal of ambiguity, there is no escape from one of the particles of negation we mentioned before, so you are safe from error. For this reason, the predecessors said: Every Affirmative has one Negative, and every Negative has one Affirmative; meaning that is only by inserting the particle of negation only. [41v] 6 - Chapter on the Divisions of Propositions regarding Truth and Falsehood: Since we mentioned that the elements of Reports are three—meaning their division is three: Necessary, Possible, or Impossible—let us mention, God Almighty willing by His success to us, the modes of division of Affirmative and Negative propositions regarding Truth and Falsehood in these sections.

Likewise in the element of Possibility. For your saying: 'Every human is a writer', if you meant in potentiality [it is true]. But if you meant in actuality, the two General propositions, Affirmative and Negative, are always false in it. Like your saying: 'Every human is a writer'—meaning proficient in writing—or your saying: 'Not one of humans is a writer'; both are false. As for the element of Impossibility, the Negative is always true, and the Affirmative is always false. Like your saying: 'Every human is braying'; this is false. If you said: 'Not one of humans is braying', this is true. Then let us speak on Specific Negation and Specific Affirmation, God Almighty willing. We say, and by God we are supported, that the propositions of Specific Negation and Specific Affirmation in the element of Necessity share Truth and Falsehood by necessity.

As for the element of Impossibility, they also share Truth and Falsehood, in that your saying 'Some people are stones' is false, and its negation 'Some people are not stones' is true.

But now he has been truthful in his negating braying from some of them, a correct, certain truthfulness, and he remained silent about the rest. It does not bind the one who reported about some of the Species with a report general to it and general to the rest of its species that he must report about the rest of the Species unless he wishes to report. Silence is not speech; whoever is silent has not spoken. Do not judge anyone by his silence as a judgment that is only known by speech, except where the Sharia has passed judgment regarding what became—by command—outside the known customary practice only. That is only in two places with no third: One is the Prophet's approval, peace be upon him, of what he saw. The second is the silence of the virgin [in marriage consent]. Whoever spoke has not remained silent. Do you not see that whoever said 'Zayd's soul is living, rational, mortal' is truthful? If the opinion of this thinker whose error we invalidated were true, the speaker saying 'Zayd's soul is living, rational, mortal' would be a liar, because according to the judgment of these ignorant people, he would be affirming for the rest of people's souls the contrary of what he reported about Zayd's soul. This is what no rational person thinks. If this were so, all Singular Propositions would be false—meaning every report about an individual would be false, since it implies for them that the rest of his species is contrary to that. Since this is stubborn denial of sense, what we said first is correct: that the reporter stating that 'Some people are not donkeys' is truthful. The negation of what is negated is more worthy of truth in it than the affirmation of what is affirmed. It does not bind him that he be thought to have necessitated donkey-ness for the rest of the remaining species he was silent about. Rather, the rest of the species is suspended on what it is upon—meaning it has the judgment that became necessary for it by other than this proposition which judged some of it. This is what many of those who spoke in the science of Sharia erred in regarding \"Dalenat al-Khitab\" (Implication of Address/Inverse Implication), judging corrupt propositions by it. Likewise, whoever reported a Possible thing saying: 'Some people are writers' or 'Zayd is not a writer', there is not in it that the rest of people are not writers, nor that whoever is other than Zayd is a writer. His saying does not necessitate what we mentioned regarding what he was silent about at all. Rather, the judgment of the rest is taken from other proofs and propositions other than this. If what these heedless people thought were true, it would be necessary by necessity that the saying [43r] of the speaker: 'Zayd is a writer' is a lie, since that necessitates according to their judgment that all people except him are [not] writers.

The saying of one who said: 'What is beyond it is outside its judgment' is false, and the saying of one who said: 'What is beyond it is inside its judgment' is also false. By God Almighty is success. Let no thinker think that this is a refutation of what we said in our books on Religious Rulings: that the ruling by which the First One Almighty judged on the tongue of the one He sent as a Messenger to us regarding an individual of a species is binding on the entire species, unless it is clarified that He specialized that individual with it. We also said that it is not binding on other than that species at all, except by a statement indicating that it is in other species. Whoever thinks this thought about our speech has missed understanding our saying. The explanation of that is that the number of individuals is infinite according to us, as we presented at the beginning of this register. There is no way to encompass every individual among them with an address specific to him, since they are originating generation after generation. The Messenger, peace be upon him, is sent to judge in every individual and upon every individual that originates forever until the end of the World of Testing. So if he, peace be upon him, judged regarding an individual with a ruling and did not inform us that he specialized him with it nor that individual was singled out by a speech specializing him, it was like his ruling on the part (some) which was in his era, and that was applicable by accepted premises to every originating individual forever. It suffices for the invalidity of this objection that nothing of his speech, peace be upon him, came isolated except that a clear, general explanation came with it for whoever is other than that individual and what is other than it forever. This is not the place to discuss that; we only alerted to it so that one who encounters it among those who hold our view does not become confused. By God Almighty is success. Know that your saying: 'All people are living' and the saying of the one debating you: 'Some people are living' is not a contradiction to your saying. Likewise if he said: 'Zayd is alive'. Rather, this is 'Following' (Tatali/Subalternation) in Affirmation, because he followed you and verified some of your saying, and did not contradict you in the rest nor agreed with you, but withheld from it. Likewise if you said: 'All people are not stones', and he said: 'Some people are not stones', he did not contradict you, but followed in Negation—meaning pursued.

As for Singular Propositions—which report about a single person—they always share Truth and Falsehood in the Necessary, Possible, and Impossible. As for the Necessary, the Affirmative is always true and the Negative is false, like your saying: 'Zayd is alive' / 'not alive'. As for the Impossible, the Affirmative is always false and the Negative is true, like your saying: 'Zayd is a stone' / 'not a stone'. As for the Possible, however the reality of the report agrees with the attribute of the reported person—like your saying: 'Zayd is a doctor' / 'Zayd is not a doctor'—the one that agrees with his attribute is true, either the Affirmative or the Negative, and the one that contradicts his attribute is false, either the Affirmative or the Negative. 7 - Chapter on Mentioning the Position of Negation: Know that it is obligatory to observe, if you want to negate a certain attribute, where you place the particle of negation. The principle of judgment in it, if you want clarification and removal of ambiguity, is to place the particle of negation before the Report (Predicate), not before the Reported About (Subject). Your opponent says: 'Zayd is living', so you say: 'Zayd is not living'. Know that the Ancients, if they placed the particle of negation before the Subject—which is the Reported About—whether a report was with it or not, they called it then 'Non-Obtained' (Indefinite/Infinite). [And] if they placed it before the Subject, and placed it a second time also before the Predicate which is the Report, they called it 'Non-Obtained and Changed'. If they placed it before the Predicate [only], it was named 'Changed' (Metathetic) only. They mentioned that it may occur in the Indefinite (Neglected) which has no quantifier, in the Singular which is reporting about a single person, and in the Quantified. If they placed it before the Predicate in the Quantified proposition, they called it: 'Privative' (Maslub). If they placed it before the Quantifier, they called it 'Contradictory' (Naqid). If they placed it in every place of these places, they gathered for it the three mentioned names. Every proposition where the particle of negation is not before its subject—which is the Reported [About]—is called 'Simple', whether negative or affirmative, quantified or unquantified.

For if you said: 'Not every human is a writer' (2), you spoke truth, and you only negated (3) by that writing from some people in reality, not from all of them—as we presented that Partial Negation appears by a universal statement and by a particular one also. Contemplate that in your saying: 'Laysa kullu insanin katiban' (Not every human is a writer); this is clearer in the Arabic language and more evident in that it is a negation by a particular [44r]. Likewise if you implied the noun of 'Laysa', saying: 'Laysa kullu insanin katib' (Not every human is a writer), meaning 'The judgment is not: every human is a writer'. These are all Particular Negations, so grasp that firmly. But if you said: 'Every human is not a writer' (Kullu insanin la katib), you negated writing from all as one. So guard against the likes of this. The least in that is that your report is a lie, even if you did not intend it, so you mislead by that one who thinks well of you. This is a plan of degradation a virtuous person is not pleased with. Know that you only negate what you attach the negation particle to. If you attached it to the Predicate—which is the Report about the Reported About—you negated the entire Predicate. If you attached it to the Quantifier, you only negate part of the proposition or all of it according to the form of your wording in the language. Do you not see that you say: 'It is possible that Zayd be a prince'; this is a 'Contradictory' because you negated the Mode (Naw'/Type) which is the Element, meaning you negated the possibility of the entire proposition. If you placed the negation particle after 'possible' and before the mention of 'be' (yakun) which is the Time, saying 'It is possible that Zayd not be a prince', this is 'Change' because you did not negate Possibility but affirmed it, but inserted into it the negation of what your opponent inserted Possibility into. The premise changed from its state, which is: Zayd being a prince. If you placed the negation particle after the Element and the Time—meaning after the word of admissibility which is Possibility and after the word of Being—and before the Subject which is the Reported About, saying: 'It is possible that be not-Zayd (other than Zayd) a prince', you did not negate anything from Zayd.

Rather, you reported about 'other than Zayd', and 'other than Zayd' is not obtained—who he is nor what he is. You kept Possibility and Being as they are, affirmed not negated. Likewise, the premise your opponent affirmed, you did not negate it nor affirm it either, but kept silent about it entirely, so you did not contradict him nor oppose him. If you placed the negation particle after the Mode, after the Time, after the Subject, and after the Predicate (1), saying: 'It is possible that Zayd be not-a-prince', this is Privation, and also called 'Transfer' (Intiqal), because you affirmed the Mode which is Possibility, the Time which is Being, and the Subject which is the Reported About, and negated from them the Predication which your opponent affirmed only. This is a negative proposition. The same is said in Indefinite propositions and in Predicative propositions with no difference in negating what you negate and affirming what you affirm. Understand the difference of these ranks; their benefit in presenting truths, cultivating, and removing ambiguity is of very [great] benefit. By God Almighty [44v] is success. Know that if you affirmed for the Reported About—using the word \"Dhu\" (Possessor of)—a certain thing, like your saying: 'Possessor of wealth' or 'Possessor of such attribute', then if you want to negate that from him for whom you affirmed it, you must keep the word \"Dhu\" in your negation of that, saying: 'He is not a possessor of wealth'. 8 - Remaining Discourse on the Divisions of Propositions regarding Truth and Falsehood: Know that among propositions are those that are true individually and true collectively; those that are true individually and false collectively; those that are false individually and true collectively; and those that are false individually and false collectively. That which (2) is true individually and collectively is like your saying: Human is living, Human is rational, Human is mortal, Human is laughing. All that is right and true. If you said: Human is living, rational, mortal, laughing; all that is right and true. As for that which (3) is true individually and false collectively, it is like a slave who is striving (Mujtahid) for himself not for his master.

This is only in the two predicated attributes if they are related to two different things, so you confused by dropping what it is related to, giving the illusion that both attributes are related to one thing. As for that which is true collectively and false separately, it is like a man strong of soul, weak of body. If you said: 'So-and-so is weak', you lied. If you said 'So-and-so is strong', you lied. Until you combine and say: 'So-and-so is strong of soul, weak of body'. This is only in what (1) the attribute is not said absolutely but by relation. As for that which is false collectively and individually, it is like your saying: 'Man is neighing', 'Man is braying', 'Man is brave' [if false]. This is a lie. If you combined it saying 'Man is neighing braying brave', it is also a lie. Grasp all of this if you want to verify knowledge and correct propositions. By God Almighty is success. 9 - Chapter on Discourse on Equivalents (Mula'imat): This is a term by which the Ancients expressed propositions of different wordings but agreeing meanings, even if the appearance of the wording of some is Negation and the appearance of some is Affirmation—yet they are agreeing in meanings a correct agreement with no difference between them. Know that reports [45r] and propositions may come with various wordings while their meaning is one. The ignorant thinks they have different meanings because of what he sees of the difference of their wordings, so he errs greatly. This is something seekers of truths should grasp and stand upon its ranks, not passing by it turning away. An example of that from Sharia examples is your saying: 'A man's intercourse with anything other than his permissible wife or his permissible maidservant is forbidden (Haram)', and your saying: 'Nothing of what is other than a man's permissible wife or his permissible maidservant is lawful (Halal)'. Two meanings agreeing, corresponding. The wordings are different; the appearance of one proposition is permission [if read loosely, but here structure implies prohibition definition] and the appearance of the other is prohibition. Likewise if you said: 'Everything that is not pork is lawful', and your saying: 'Some of what is not pork is not lawful' [Note: Text seems to contrast lawful/not lawful]. These are two different wordings and two agreeing meanings. Thus you should contemplate the incoming words and contemplate their meanings so that you and your opponent do not pull at arts of difference and dispute while you are agreed, not disagreeing.",

An example of that is that we say: 'Zayd is righteous'. If you privated righteousness saying 'Zayd is other than righteous', then if you negated the negation saying 'Zayd is not other than righteous', you have affirmed righteousness for him. Preserve this, you will rest from much rioting and much confusion. Do not transgress this rank, God willing. Know that the Universal among Reports which are called Propositions and Premises necessitates the Particular among them; meaning that the Particular is part of the Universal if both are Affirmative or both are Negative. This is a meaning of the meanings of 'Following' (Subalternation/Tatali) which we mentioned before. Do you not see that you say: 'Every sensing thing is living'; this is a Universal proposition. Then your opponent or you say: 'Every human is living'. This Particular is not opposing that Universal at all nor incompatible with it; rather, it is part of it and entering under it. An example of this in Sharia is the saying of God Almighty: {The thief, male and female, cut their hands} (5 Al-Ma'idah: 38). Then the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: \"Cutting is in a quarter of a dinar.\" This Particular is part of that Universal and an explanation of a part of its parts. It is not refuting it nor anything of it at all, nor preventing cutting in less than a quarter dinar unless by inserting a particle of negation, so what the particular wording negated is negated then. That would be like a speaker saying: 'The sensing is rational', then saying after that: 'There is no rational except human, angel, and jinn'. This Particular would be explaining the intent of the speaker: 'The sensing is rational', meaning he intended some sensing things not all of them. That is not a lie, because 'Sensing' applies to 'Human'—meaning he is described by it—just as it applies to every animal. This statement is for Universals among Negatives [46r] and Particulars among them, with no difference. By God Almighty is success. We have come upon everything the seeker of truths and supervisor of correct meanings of speech has need and necessity for regarding the rulings of Reports which are Composite Nouns. Things remain which will occur, God Almighty willing, in the book following this, which is the Book of the Art of Demonstration.

We also added to it what he mentioned in his fifth book of his books on Logic, named \"Topica\", which is the subject on Dialectic. We increased in this things from the ranks of argumentation and its conditions which disputants seeking truths cannot do without, since what is mentioned in this book is among the condition of establishing Demonstration and its consequences attached to it. We also added to it what he mentioned in his sixth book on Logic, named in Greek \"Sophistica\", which is the description of the people of rioting who deviate from truths to supporting ignorance and jugglery, since the seeker of truths cannot do without knowing the people of this description and preparing for them. Since all we mentioned is clinging to Demonstration, we gathered it to it and reached the limit in investigation, expansion, explanation, and brevity as we promised. Praise be to God. We say, and by the First Creator we seek help: Matters have passed for us in the preceding books of this register which must be grasped, remembered, and present in understanding and memorization, and brought forth when needed for clarification to yourself from others and clarification from you to others, by the power of the First One and His strength gifted from Him to us, Mighty and Majestic.

    "text": "...for us in the parts preceding this part. Our purpose is the clarification of establishing Demonstration and the quality of correcting Inference in the sentences of difference occurring between differers in whatever they differed in. We say, and by the First One we are supported: We have said that the Proposition does not give you more than itself. If two opponents agree on it, validate it, and commit to its judgment, and differ in a branch of the branches of that meaning, they must bring another proposition they agree on its validity also. If the two mentioned propositions are correct in their nature and composition, then submission to them is necessary for each one. Know that the two mentioned propositions, if they gather, the Ancients named them \"The Conjunction\" (Premise Pair/Qarinah). Know that by their gathering—as we mentioned—a third proposition always occurs from them, always true, necessary by necessity, from which there is no deviation. This proposition occurring from the gathering [47r] of the two propositions is named \"Conclusion\" (Natijah). The Ancients call the two propositions and the conclusion together in the Greek language \"Syllogismos\" (1). All three are called in the Arabic language: \"The Collector\" (Al-Jami'ah). An example of that is you say: 'Every human is living'; this is a proposition called individually: \"Premise\". Then you say: 'And every living thing is a substance'; also a proposition called individually \"Premise\". If you gather them together, its name is \"Conjunction\" (Qarinah) due to their pairing. That is if you said: 'Every human is living, and every living thing is a substance', a third proposition occurs from this gathering, which is 'Every human is a substance'. This proposition is called individually \"Conclusion\". If you gather all three, they are called \"The Collector\" (Al-Jami'ah); and the Collector is the Syllogism. We presented in the part before this the mention of Propositions, that they are Simple and Changed. We said that the Changed in the Subject are the Non-Obtained, which are those where negation particles fall before the Described Thing which is the Reported About, which the Ancients call the Subject. Know that these which (2) are called Changed do not produce [a conclusion]. Meaning it is not trusted that they produce in every case a correct production always never betraying. Even if they may produce in some conditions, they may also produce falsehood. What is of this description, which is true once and false another, should not be trusted regarding its premises nor the results occurring from them, nor...",

Then we have said that Simple [Propositions]—which are verified with the Reported About then affirmed an attribute for it or negated an attribute from it—among them are Quantified and Indefinite. We explained that the Quantified is what is preceded by a word clarifying that the intent is Generality, called Universal; or a word clarifying that the intent is Specificity, called Particular. That is like your saying: 'All people are speaking', 'Some people are speaking' or 'writing' if you wish, 'Not one of people is neighing', 'Not some [people] are neighing' or 'writing' if you wish, and the like. The Ancients mentioned that Indefinite [propositions] do not produce, just as we mentioned regarding Changed ones, exactly the same. This is not correct in the Arabic language; the people only narrated about their language. But we say that the Indefinite, as long as its speaker does not clarify that he intends by it some of what its name gives, or a necessary preventer does not prevent Generality in it, is like the Quantified Universal with no difference. The explanation of this will come in what we resume, God Almighty willing. Upon this judgment, it follows that the Indefinite produces like the production of the Quantified Universal. Then we return and say that Particulars among [47v] the Quantified, and the Indefinite which is certain to be particular, do not produce; meaning they do not produce a correct, necessary production always. We only said this if the two premises are both Particular, whether Negative or Affirmative. But if one is Universal and the other Particular, that produces, as we will explain after this, God Almighty willing. Know that the Singular Proposition, which specializes a specific single person, its rule in all we said is the rule of the Particular with no difference in that, like your saying: 'Zayd is departing' and the like. Then we said that the Quantified is divided into two parts: Affirmative and Negative. Know that Negative Propositions also do not produce, whether Universal or Particular—meaning they do not produce a trusted production in every case. That is only if they are both Negative. But if one is Negative and the other Affirmative, that produces, as we will explain after this, God Almighty willing.

Either one of the premises combines both matters: Generality and Affirmation; or the premises share the matters so one is Universal and the second is Affirmative. Know that we presented that the least of propositions is a proposition of two words: Subject and Predicate, meaning Reported About and Report. If you want to gather two propositions from which a Demonstration rises, there must be in both propositions a word existing in each of them—meaning that word is repeated in each of the premises. And there must be in each of them a word unique to it and not repeated in the other. Since if they agreed in the Reported About and the Report, the two propositions would be one proposition by necessity. Like your saying: 'Every human is living', and 'Every living thing is a substance'. These are two propositions; the mention of 'Living' is repeated in each of them. This repeated word as we mentioned is called by the Ancients \"The Middle Term\" (Al-Hadd Al-Mushtarak) due to the sharing of the two propositions in it. Each of them is unique with a word; the first is unique with 'Human' because it is mentioned in it and not in the second—if it were mentioned, the second would be the first itself. The second is unique with 'Substance' and it is not mentioned in the first—if it were mentioned, they would be one. Understand this and grasp it, God Almighty willing. Know that Simple Quantified Propositions [48r] are divided into two parts: A part that Reflects (Converts) and a part that does not Reflect. Reflection (Conversion) is to make the Report a Reported About (Subject) described, and make the Reported About a Report (Predicate) described by it, without the meaning changing in that at all. Rather, if the proposition was Affirmative before Conversion, it is Affirmative after Conversion. If it was Negative before Conversion, it is Negative after Conversion. If it was True before Conversion, it is True after Conversion. If it was False before Conversion, it is False after Conversion. Except that in some places, the proposition is Universal before Conversion, and Particular after Conversion; it does not differ in Conversion other than this at all. We only mean by this Conversion what does not transform (become impossible/false) ever in what we mentioned before. As for what may convert as we mentioned in some places, but perhaps also changes when converted—either from truth to falsehood, or falsehood to truth, or negation to...",

This section is not what we care about in establishing Demonstration because it may betray and is not continuously true always. The Conversion we mentioned is only the exchange of the positions of words in the proposition only. We presented the modes of divisions of attributes in the described before, and that they are six: Describing a thing by what is Necessary for it is divided into two parts: Either more General than it, like Life for Man, for it encompasses him and encompasses with him many species (1) other than him. Or Equal, like Laughter for Man, for it is for every human and not for non-humans at all; and it is not permissible to be more Specific at all. Describing a thing by what is Possible for it is divided into two parts: Either more General like Blackness, for it is in some people and in things other than people. Or more Specific like Medicine, for it is in some people not others, and not in non-people; and it is not permissible to be Equal at all, because if it were Equal it would be Necessary, and the Necessary is other than the Possible. Describing a thing by its Impossibility, by what is Impossible in it, so it is more General like describing Man that he is not a stone; for this description encompasses him and encompasses every animal. It may be possible to find it Equal like negating Inanimateness from Animal. Then we return to the clarification of Conversion. We say, and by the One Creator we are supported: The Universal Negative Converts to Universal Negative. We say: 'Not one of humans is a stone'. If you convert it, you say: 'Not one of stones is a human'. Know that whatever converts universally converts particularly, since whatever you affirmed for the Whole is affirmed for every part of its parts named by its name, and whatever you negated from the Whole is negated from every part of its parts which [48v] is named by its name. We mean by Parts here the individuals of the Species, where every individual is named by the name of the Species—for every human is named in his essence 'a human', and the Species also is all named 'Human'. We did not mean parts of the body where the name of the Whole does not apply to the part, like the hand of a human and his leg. Do you not see that if you said also 'Not some stones are human' or said 'Not some humans are stones', you would be truthful? This which we mentioned is a correct Conversion true always.

If you also said: 'And some sensing things are living', you would be truthful. This is only true in the Equal (Co-extensive). For this conversion, if it is true in one place, it is false in another, as we presented. It is only false if the Description is more general than the Described or more specific than it, as we presented. As for the more General, it is like your saying: 'Every human is living'. As for the more Specific, it is like our saying: 'Every doctor is human'. If you converted and said: 'And some humans are doctors', you would be truthful. If you said: 'And all humans are doctors', you would be lying. Therefore, we intended its conversion to Particular because it is true in all that always, in every case of General, Specific, or Equal (1). Guard against this chapter and do not err in it. If you follow the path we paved for you, you are safe from error entirely, and there is no way against your speech. The Particular Affirmative converts to Affirmative. You say: 'If some humans are grammarians, then some grammarians are humans'. It does not convert to Universal, because even if you are truthful in some places, you would be lying in other places also. It is true in the Specific and Equal Predication, and false in the General Predication. If you converted it to Particular, it would be true always in every case. Do you not see that you say: 'If some grammarians are humans, then all humans are grammarians', you lied. Know that all these propositions which we mentioned convert—meaning they are true if converted always—are true in your affirming the Necessary, in all your reporting about the Possible with what is true of its attributes, and in your negating the Impossible. [49r]. Know that the Particular Negative does not convert; meaning it has no rank in which it is true always. Because even if it is true in negating the Impossible—if you said: 'Some humans are not stones', and converted saying: 'And some stones [are not humans]', you spoke truth—if you negated the Possible with a true negation saying: 'Not every human is a doctor', you are truthful. If you converted saying: 'And not every doctor is a human', or said: 'And not some doctors are humans', you would be lying. Therefore, we did not busy ourselves with converting...",

We exemplify that with a Sharia example. We say: You say in the Universal Negative: 'If it is correct that no intoxicant is lawful, then no lawful thing is an intoxicant'. Or if you converted it to Particular, it would also be true. But the Universal is more complete and more general of requirements, so we sufficed with it if we found it, and dispensed with mentioning what is folded within it of particulars, except that reporting about the Whole is reporting about every part of its parts. We say in the Universal Affirmative: 'If every parent is obligatory to be treated kindly, then some of those obligatory to be treated kindly are parents'. If you converted it to Universal, you would be lying, because kindness is obligatory to the mother, the Caliph, the scholar, the virtuous, and the neighbor, and not one of these is a parent (father). You say in the conversion of the Particular Affirmative: 'If some disbelievers are of permissible blood, then some of those of permissible blood are disbelievers'. If you converted it to Universal saying: 'And everyone of permissible blood is a disbeliever', you would be lying, because the married adulterer is of permissible blood and is not a disbeliever. Understand all this and trust it, for it never betrays you. The proof of the validity of what we mentioned first—if we said 'No human is a stone' and that it converts universally so we say 'And no stone is a human'—is that if an opponent opposes us in the validity of this conversion, we say: If our conversion is not true, then its contradictory is true according to what we presented of the divisions of the two propositions of Negation and Affirmation regarding Truth and Falsehood. The contradictory of our saying 'No stone is a human' is 'Some stones are human'. We join our saying 'Some stones are human' to our premise which we validated, saying: 'No human is a stone, and some stones are human'. If some stones are human, then some humans are stones. Yet we presented that 'No human is a stone'. This is a contradiction and impossible. This is what we mentioned in the element of Necessity, which is the inherence of the Attribute to the Described. As for the element of Possibility, there is no difference between [49v] propositions in Particular Affirmatives and what we mentioned of propositions of the element of Necessity. We say in the General Predication: 'If some humans are black, then some blacks are humans'. We say in the Specific Predication: 'If some humans are doctors, then some doctors are humans'. There is no Equal Predication in Possibility because the Equal is necessary for the entire Species in actuality. As for Universal propositions of Possibility, they are false in Affirmatives. We say: 'It is possible that every human is black or a doctor'; this is false. The conversion of the Specific Predication...",

We say: 'If it is possible that not one of humans be black or a doctor, then it is possible that not one of blacks or doctors be a human'. As for the Particular Negative in the element of Possibility, it converts to Particular Negative. We say: 'It is possible that some humans are not black', and its conversion: 'It is possible that some blacks are not humans'. This is in the General Predication. It is false in the Specific Predication, because if you said: 'It is possible that some humans are not doctors', you are truthful. If you converted and said: 'It is possible that some doctors are not humans', you lied. As for the element of Impossibility, the Particular Affirmative converts to Particular Affirmative. We say: 'It is impossible that some humans are not stones' [Double Negative? Context implies Affirmation: Impossible some humans are stones -> Impossible some stones are humans], and 'It is impossible that some stones are not humans'. It also converts to a true Universal Affirmative, so we say: 'It is impossible that every stone be a human'. As for the Universal Affirmative, it also converts to true Universal and Particular always. We say: 'It is impossible that every human be a stone', and 'It is impossible that every stone be a human', and 'It is impossible that some stones be human'. As for the Universal Negative in the element of Impossibility, it converts to Particular. You say: 'If it is impossible that not every human be living' [Impossible that no human is living], then 'It is impossible that not some living things be human'. This is true in preventing the negation of Laughter which is equal to the Species. In the Specific Predication like Medicine and the like, we say: 'If it is impossible that no doctor is a human, then it is impossible that some humans are not doctors' [Logic unclear in text, likely means 'Impossible no human is a doctor']. As for the Particular Negative in the element of Impossibility, it converts to Particular Negative, like your saying 'It is impossible that some living things are not humans'. This converts in the Equal and Specific Predication always. Our benefit in knowing the conversion of propositions is from two aspects. One is what we resume of reducing some Demonstrations that contain difficulty to the clear explanation among them, which is what will come, God Almighty willing [50r], in reducing the modes of the Second and Third Figures to the First Figure, explained...",

The second aspect is in correcting the premises which seekers of invalidating truths want to present to make them principles to produce from them what witnesses to the correct sayings. Since we presented that the Proposition consists of Subject and Predicate—meaning Reported About and Report—and that the Conjunction (Syllogism pair) consists of two premises in each of which is a word shared by the two premises together, know that every word of the words of the two premises is called by the Ancients a \"Term\" (Hadd), and they call the shared word: \"The Middle Term\" (Al-Hadd Al-Mushtarak). Know that the Figures of Demonstration are only three—we mean by its Figures the forms of Conjunctions from which Demonstration arises—because the Middle Term must be Predicate in one premise and Subject in the second; or be Predicate in both of them; or be Subject in both of them. There is no way for the rank of Reason to a fourth division in any way at all. Know also that there is no difference between your saying: 'Life is in every human' and your saying: 'Every human is living'—you mean in meaning. The Ancients call this \"Predicate Precedence\" (Taqdim al-Haml), meaning you make the Attribute reported about, and the Described returned to the Attribute as if it is a report about it. Do not mind the difference of these expressions. Know that the Ancients call the premise containing the more General word \"Major Premise\" (Muqaddimah Kubra). Like your saying: 'Every human is living', and 'Every living thing is a substance'. The one mentioning Substance contains a word more general than the word in the other premise, because Substance is more general than Living and Human. The other they call the Minor (Sughra). Know that two Particular Negatives do not produce [a conclusion], nor two Singulars—which is reporting about a specific single person. Know that the Middle Term is not mentioned in the Conclusion at all; if it were mentioned in it, the Conclusion would be one of the premises. Only the word unique to the one premise and the word unique to the second premise are mentioned in the Conclusion. Know that nothing comes out in the Conclusion except the least of what is in the two premises and the farthest from certainty and decisiveness, because the Conclusion by its nature follows the truth in them. Therefore, nothing comes out in it except the least regarding which there is no doubt. If one of the premises is Indefinite and the other is Quantified...",

Except that if they are both Universal (1), the Conclusion is Universal, and perhaps it is Particular; do not mind this, for the Particular is enfolded in the Universal, while the Universal is not enfolded in the Particular. We mention based on what we told you that the Figures of Demonstration are three: The First Figure has four Moods (Anha'); the Second has [four Moods]; and the Third Figure has six Moods. We only mean by that the Moods true in production always in every case. The Figure for Demonstration is like the Genus, the Mood for it is like the Species, then the taken Premises are like Individuals—and they are uncounted by number because they are used in every science in every issue.

Indeed, we may present them correct and they produce for you a false conclusion. The deceptive of this chapter is like what I say to you: 'Not every human is a stone, and not every stone is a donkey'. Conclusion: 'So not every human is a donkey'. This is true. The exposer of all we mentioned is like what I say to you: You say 'Not every human is black, and not every black thing is living'. These two are true. Conclusion: 'So not every human is living'.

The first conjunction was true due to the good arrangement of the premises, because you arranged them such that what you negated from the stone is what is negated from the human entirely. I show you now increased clarity in the truth of this judgment. I will make for you two premises, one of which is a pure lie, producing for you a true production. That is to say: 'Every human is a stone, and every stone is a substance'. Conclusion: 'So every human is a substance'. You say: 'Not every human is a dog, and not [51r] every dog is a horse'. Conclusion: 'Not every human is a horse'. That is true. The first is a lying premise that produced truth by its good arrangement, which is that you described the stone with an attribute encompassing it and encompassing the human. The other in negation is likewise—we mean in good arrangement only. Know now that there must be truth in each of the premises, and with truth in them, there must be good arrangement on the path I described to you. Otherwise, matters will confuse and confound you, and truth will mix in your mind with falsehood. Likewise in two Particular premises. We presented that the ruling of the Singular is the ruling of the Particular with no difference. We say: 'Zayd is rational, and some rational beings are dead'. So 'Zayd is dead'. This is a true conclusion. But do not trust two Particular premises at all, nor two Singulars, nor a Singular and a Particular. Know that these were only true due to the truth of the report about the natures of the reported-about and the generality of the attribute for the reported-about. I show you the treachery of this path. That is to say: 'Zayd is white, and some white things are stones'. True. Conclusion: 'So Zayd is a stone'. This is a lie. If you wish, you say: 'Zayd is rational, and some rational beings are writers'. These are two true premises. Conclusion: 'So Zayd is a writer'. This is a conclusion possible to be true and possible to be false. Ponder the likes of this and do not forget it; you will be safe from great rioting and know that two Particulars, two Singulars, and a Particular [mixed] do not produce a true, consistent, consistent production that does not betray. Here we are, by the power of God our One Creator Almighty and His aid to us, commencing the specification of the three Figures mentioned just now with a Sharia example to be easier for the seeker and clearer for doubt.

Taste it a taste that never betrays you, ponder it deeply, and guard it strictly. It is what the Ancients made rugged and expressed [51v] with letters of the alphabet, being stingy with it. We sought reward in revealing it, facilitating it, and bringing it closer to everyone who looks into it for the reasons we mentioned at the beginning of this register of ours. We were not content until we made all Moods from one word in Affirmation and one word in Negation, so that the return of some to others and the suitability of some to others and the existence of work in taking Demonstration by them appears. We brought close the distant of that, clarified the problematic, explained the difficult, eased the rugged, and humbled the hard. We do not know anyone who permitted that nor tired his mind in it before us; praise be to God first and last. By your standing on this chapter, you push away from yourself the cloud of ignorance and aversion generated by panic from bad opinion of this science and the intensity of distress from the jugglery of many who claim it while not being of its people.

The Major is always delayed so that the word unique to it comes out as Predicate in the Conclusion—meaning Report. Know that if an attribute falls under the Species in Time in one of the premises, it is necessary by necessity that the other be Universal. We mentioned before that some Ancients described that the Major Premise contains a word more General than the two final words—the Shared one and the one the other premise is unique with.

Proof of the validity of this Conclusion: We convert the Negative Premise saying: If not one of stones is living, then not one of humans is a stone [Error in text logic? Should be: then not one of living is a stone]. And we said 'Every human is living'. We add the word obtained for us in conversion to this one not converted, saying: 'Every human is living, and not one of the living is a stone'. This is the Second Mood of the First Figure exactly. The Reported About came out in the conversion as Report, and the Report as Reported About, as we presented when we described the ranks of Conversion, so remember it. We only did not convert the Affirmative because if we converted it, the Third Mood of the Figure would come to us, and it will come after this, God Almighty willing. The Second Mood of the Second Figure: And not one of stones is living, and every human is living. Conclusion: Not one of stones [52v] is a human. There is no [difference] between this Mood and the one before it at all, except that the Major of that is the Minor of this—delayed there and advanced here—and the Minor of that is the Major of this—advanced there and delayed here.

So: Not one of the living is a stone, and every human is living; so not one of stones is a human [Error in deduction steps in text? Should lead to: No human is a stone]. Then we convert this Conclusion saying: If not one of stones is a human, then not one of humans is a stone. This is the Conclusion of the Second Figure from the First Mood exactly. Know that the two premises of this Mood and the one before it are equal; there is no word in one more general than the word in the other.

This Mood is different in rank from the one before it regarding presenting the Particular and delaying it. The Major of that is the Minor of this, and the Minor of that is the Major of this. Except that the Subject of the Conclusion of the one before this comes out as Predicate in the Conclusion of this one in rank, and the Predicate of the Conclusion of that as Subject in the Conclusion of this one, since the Term in the Major Premise is [53v] the one that comes out as Predicate in the Conclusion. Its proof is by converting the Particular Premise. We say: If some people are substances, then some substances are people. Then we add to the Universal Premise saying: Some substances are people, and all people are living. Conclusion: Some substances are living. This is the rank of the Third Mood of the First Figure exactly. The Fifth Mood of the Third Figure: Every human is living, and some people are not stones. Conclusion: So some living things are not stones. There is no conversion in this, because if you converted the Universal, it would convert to Particular, and we add to it another Particular; and two Particulars do not produce. And the Negative Particular does not convert. But its proof raises speech to absurdity. We say: If...",

    "text": "...the mentioned Conclusion were false, then its contradictory is true, which is 'Every living thing is a stone'. Then we say: 'Every human is living, and every living thing is a stone'. Conclusion: 'So every human is a stone'. Yet we agreed in the Premise that 'Some people are not stones'. This is impossible. The Conclusion of this Mood is the Conclusion of the Second Mood of the Third Figure. This Mood returns to the Fourth Mood of the First Figure by taking the Conclusion and adding it to the Minor Premise. You say: 'Every human is living, and some living things are not stones'. Conclusion: 'So some people are not stones'. This is the Conclusion of the Fourth Mood of the First Figure. This Mood does not have in its Major a word more general than in its Minor. The Sixth Mood of the Third Figure: Some living things are human, and not one of living things is a stone. Conclusion: Some living things are not stones. Its proof is by one conversion. We say: If some living things are human, then some people are living. Then we add that to the Universal Negative saying: Some people are living, and not one of living things is a stone. This is the Fourth Mood of the First Figure. We only did not convert what did not convert of the premises in the Second and Third Figures because they would only result in two Particulars, or result in what had resulted before or after them of Moods, or because it would be longer in operation. We intended the briefest and most beneficial. These are the Moods other than which do not produce a consistent production. We will explain, God Almighty willing, the objections of the rioters in these Figures, and the solution to that by God's power and strength. Here we are taking to exemplifying these Moods with a Divine Example and a Sharia Example by the power of God, the Giver of virtues to whom He wills of His servants, to show the merit of this [54r] Art in every science. The First Figure. The First Mood of the First Figure: Every thing emerging into actuality from the world is counted, and every counted thing is finite (1). So every thing emerging into actuality from the world is finite. Sharia Example: Every intoxicant is wine (Khamr), and every wine is forbidden. So every intoxicant is forbidden. The Second Mood of it: Every thing emerging into actuality from the world is counted, and not one of counted things is eternal. So nothing of what emerged into actuality from the world is eternal. Sharia Example: Every intoxicant is wine, [and no wine] is lawful. So every intoxicant is not lawful.",

Sharia Example: Some owned things are forbidden to have intercourse with, and every forbidden thing that avoidance of is not mandated [? Context suggests: every forbidden thing is mandated to avoid]. So some owned things are mandated to be avoided. The Fourth Mood of it: Some of the world is composite, and not everything of composites is eternal. So some of the world is not eternal. Sharia Example: Some sales are usury, and nothing of usury is lawful. So some sales are not lawful. The Second Figure. The First Mood: All groups of the world are composed of their parts, and nothing of composed things (1) is eternal. So nothing of the world is eternal. Sharia Example: Every slaughter of what you do not own you have been forbidden from, and nothing is lawful of what you have been forbidden from. So your slaughter of a thing you do not own is not lawful. The Second Mood of it: Nothing eternal is composed, and all groups of the world are composed of parts in them. So nothing in the groups of the world is eternal. Sharia Example: Nothing is lawful of what you have been forbidden from, and every slaughter of what you do not own you have been forbidden from. So your slaughter of what you do not own is not lawful. The Third Mood of it: Some of the world is composite, and nothing eternal is composite. So some of the world is not eternal. Sharia Example: Some fathers are disbelievers, and not everyone whose obedience is obligatory is a disbeliever. So some fathers, their obedience is not obligatory.

Since we have completed, by God Almighty's power and His aid to us, what we promised of mentioning the Moods of the Figures of Demonstration, let us say that every Conclusion appearing in what we presented of Conjunctions: If it is Universal Affirmative, its conversion—which is Particular Affirmative—may be valid by its validity. If it is Particular Affirmative, its conversion—which is Particular Affirmative—may be valid. If it is Universal Negative, its conversion—which is Universal Negative—may be valid by its validity. If the Universal is valid, its particulars are valid; but it is not that if the Particular is valid, its Universal is valid. Contemplate this, you will find it. We have presented clear examples of that for you, dispensing with repetition. Ponder in this place the great benefit of Conversion, because what is folded within it of what we mentioned now becomes valid for you by the validity of the Conclusion. [55r] As for the Particular Negative, we have presented that it does not convert. Since what we said is so, that is a production from the Conclusion true always.

O God, bless our Master Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. 2 - Chapter on Mentioning Conditional Propositions: We say, and by God we seek help, that the Conditional is that wherein a necessary thing is not decided in the description of the described [absolutely]. This Conditional is divided into two parts: Either Suspended (Mu'allaqah) on another thing, or Separating (Disjunctive/Muqassimah). The Suspended is divided into two parts: The Suspended by a sentence, called Conjunctive (Muttasilah), which is where the judgment is suspended on another judgment; it becomes valid by its validity or void by its invalidity. Example of that: 'If the one who committed adultery is chaste (Muhsan), mature, sane, but previously married (Thayyib), then he is flogged and stoned (1).' This is a Conditional proposition composed of two judgments: One is the description of the adulterer, and the second is the description of what is done to him if he commits adultery, which is flogging and stoning. The first judgment is called the Antecedent (Muqaddam), which is your saying [55v] 'If he committed adultery while being chaste, mature, sane, previously married'. The second judgment is called the Consequent (Tali), which is your saying 'Then he is flogged and stoned'. Stick to this naming also so it repeats for you, God Almighty willing. One of the two parts of the Suspended which we mentioned just now it divides into is that you except (affirm) the Antecedent. The meaning of our saying 'except' is that you stipulate that the existence of the matter mentioned first is a cause for the existence of the matter mentioned last. If the first is not, the last is not [necessarily]. The second part is what you except (affirm) the Consequent in, meaning you stipulate that the existence of the thing mentioned last is a cause for the existence of the matter mentioned first. If the mentioned last is not, the mentioned first is not. The first part is a premise composed of a Subject and Predicate except that...",

If you want its production, you add another to it, saying: 'If the chaste, mature, sane adulterer is flogged and stoned'—this is a premise of Reported About and Report with a condition particle associated with one. Then you say: 'And this is a mature, sane adulterer'—this is a second premise to it. So a Conjunction is completed. The Result: 'Then this one is flogged and stoned.' The saying regarding everything accompanied by a condition particle is one; they are: In (If), Idh ma (Whenever), Mata ma (When), Mahma (Whatever), and the like. If you wish to advance in wording the Suspended over the Suspended Upon, you may do so. The Suspended is the Effect (Musabbab), and the Suspended Upon is the Cause (Sabab). Like Adultery with Chastity is the cause of Stoning; Sunrise is the cause of Day; and the interposition of Earth between Sun and Moon is the cause of the Moon's Eclipse. These causes are the Suspended Upon, and the Eclipse, Sun [Day?], and Day are the Effects, which are the Suspended. We say in advancing the Suspended: 'If it is Day, then the Sun has risen'; 'If he is chaste, sane, the name of Thayyib applies to the adulterer if he is mature, then he is flogged and stoned'. This is like your advancing the Predicate over the Subject in Categorical Propositions that have no condition. We say: 'Life is in every human (1) and Substantiality in every living thing, so Substantiality is in every human'. The two premises in the Conditional may be Negative, may be Affirmative, and may be Affirmative and Negative. Like your saying: 'If the sun does not set, the night does not come'; 'If there is no lightning in the atmosphere, there is no thunderbolt'; 'If he does not acknowledge what the Messenger, peace be upon him, brought, he is not a Muslim' [56r]. The first premise is your saying: 'If the sun does not set', 'If there is no lightning in the atmosphere', 'If he does not acknowledge what Muhammad, peace be upon him, brought'. The second is your saying: 'Night was not', 'Thunderbolt was not', 'He was not a Muslim'. As for two Affirmatives, it is like what we presented before. As for Affirmative and Negative, it is your saying: 'Water settles by nature unless it corrupts or alters', 'Fire rises by nature unless it corrupts or alters', 'The two sellers are by choice unless they separate'. It is as if you said: 'If you left water to its nature, it is settling'; 'If you left fire to its nature, it is rising'; 'If the two sellers are together, the choice is theirs'.",

    "text": "The premises may be many in this chapter, like your saying: 'If the world is originated, and the originated necessitates an originator, and nothing is other than the Originated and the Originator, and there is no originator other than the Originator of the world, and the origination of unnatural things appearing from a human is originated by his choice, and he brings them as witnesses to his claim, and their Originator is the Originator of the world for him, and if their Originator requested them from the Originator of the world, then the Originator of the world is a witness to the validity of what he claims. And if the Originator of the world is a witness to him, and the Originator of the world does not bear witness for a false claimant, then this is not a false claimant. And if he is not a false claimant, he is a true claimant. And if he is a true claimant, believing him is obligatory.' The Antecedent of this Conditional inference, as you see, is many premises, and the Consequent is one: 'Then if he is a true claimant, believing him is obligatory'. This is the first section we mentioned wherein the Antecedent is excepted (affirmed). Meaning the first premise is what we decide is true after stipulating that: If the first is valid, the one whose validity is suspended on its validity is valid. And if it is void, the one whose validity is suspended on its validity is void. This is necessary by primary reason, since everything that cannot be valid until another thing is valid, then if that other thing is not valid, it is necessary by necessity that the one having no validity except by the existence of a validity is not valid. From this necessary demonstrative principle, we invalidated in Laws every contract linked to a corrupt condition; it is not valid in Marriage, Divorce, Sales, Manumission, and all contracts. Likewise, if the Consequent does not exist necessarily except by the existence of the First (Antecedent), and the Consequent is not existing necessarily except by the existence of the First, then [if the First is not existing] the Consequent is not existing. If you found the first premise Particular, and said: 'If Zayd is a doctor, he is rational (speaking); but Zayd is a doctor, so he is rational'. If you excepted the contradictory of the First, whose negation you validated [56v], saying: 'But Zayd is not a doctor', it would not be valid for you that 'he is not rational'. And so is everything where the description in the premise is Particular to that in the Consequent. But if it is Equal to it or More General, then if you negated the First, the Second is negated. Like your saying: 'If the human is sensing' or you said 'laughing', 'then he is living (animal)'; 'but he is not sensing' or 'not laughing', 'so he is not living'. It is not permissible for the Consequent to be Particular to the Antecedent at all, because it is linked to it, existing by its existence; so it is always either Equal or More General. Memorize all this and grasp it. If you excepted the negation of the Consequent [meaning] you validated it, it produces for you...",

Do you not see that if you said: 'If Zayd is a doctor, he is knowledgeable; but he is not knowledgeable at all, so he is not a doctor'. Likewise the Equal; do you not see that if you said: 'If the body is a human, it is laughing; but it is not laughing, so it is not a human'. Regarding the Particular, it is also licensed to say: 'If the body is a human, it is rational; but it is not rational, so it is not a human'. If you excepted the Consequent—meaning validated it—the First is not valid for you except in the Equal alone. As for the More General, no; because if you said: 'If the body is a human, it is living', [and said 'It is living'], it is not valid for you by that that 'it is a human'. So the way is: You either validate the First, so it produces for you the validity of the Consequent; or you validate the negation of the Consequent, so the negation of the First is valid for you. But if you validated the Consequent or validated the negation of the First, validating the Consequent does not validate the First for you. Nor does validating the negation of the First validate the negation of the Consequent for you, except in the Equal only. However, if you want to negate the Consequent by negating the First in the Equal, you need an operation extending in producing that, since that is not quickly evident like the evidence of the negation of the Consequent by the negation of the First. Do you not see that if you said: 'If life is long, old age exists; but life is not long', Conclusion: 'So old age does not exist'—[this is] evident. If you said—while the Conjunction remains—'for the existence of old age is non-existent', you need, in producing from that 'that long life is non-existent', an operation. Which is to say: 'If old age exists, long life exists; so it is not possible that old age is non-existent and long life exists. Since if life were existing then by existence, then old age would not be existing [due to] long life; yet we presented that old age exists by the existence of long life. This is a contradiction'. It would only be evident if you advanced and said: 'If [57r] the weakness of old age is non-existent, then long life is non-existent'. This is evident. We have said that the section from which the opposite of the Consequent premise is excepted—meaning you validate it—produces for you the negation of the First by necessity. Like you saying: 'If the world were not originated, it would be non-composite and not finite in body; but the world is composite, finite in body; so the world is originated'. The Consequent premises in this type may be incompatible, like your saying: 'If a time exists for a non-body possessing time—while Time is only a duration by which rest or motion is counted—then a time does not exist for a non-body possessing time'.

As for the Disjunctive (Separating) Conditional, it is that you divide the thing whose ruling validity you want to know into all its parts that Reason gives it as a division originally. Those parts are only different or disparate, varying; each one is contrary to the rest. It is permissible for the parts to be two or more, but the mentioned difference is necessary. That which divides [into two] is like your saying: 'The world is either originated or eternal'; 'This thing is either forbidden or not forbidden'; 'This thing is necessary or not necessary'. And like your saying: 'These two names either apply to one meaning or to more than one meaning'. As for that which divides into more than two parts, it is to say: 'The world, if it is originated, is not devoid of: either it originated itself, or another originated it, or it originated for an originated matter'. And like saying: 'This thing is either obligatory, or level permissible, or recommended permissible, or disliked permissible, or forbidden'. These parts, as you see, are complete in meanings—meaning each part is contrary to the rest—and its division is complete, exhaustive. But if the division is incomplete—which is that you omitted some of its parts either out of ignorance, forgetfulness, or intent—its parts then are not completely differentiated. That is like your saying: 'The Originator of the world is not devoid of: either He originated it for His generosity, or His nobility, or to draw a benefit, or to repel a harm, or for a cause other than what we mentioned'. This is an incomplete division because you dropped from it the correct part, which is that He originated it for no cause at all. It may occur in this chapter [57v] that the division is only into two parts, so the divider deletes one of the two parts and mentions the other, making it universal in judgment while it is in reality particular. Like the speaker saying: 'Time is a motion of dimension', outputting that as a universal attribute of Time. Whereas Time is a meaning adhering to us—meaning not that Time is a meaning adhering to us—meaning not that Time is a motion of dimension or rest of dimension. From that also is to say: 'The Mudabbar (slave promised freedom at death) freed by death is bequeathed, so he is from the third [of the estate]'. The correct way is to say: 'The Mudabbar freed by death is either bequeathed his freedom or freed by an attribute', fulfilling the right of division. So guard against the likes of this with all caution. For the entry of fallacies often enters this chapter. The least in this chapter is that truths are blinded to you...",

If you are intentional, that is uglier, so turn away from it. From that also is to say: 'Either Zayd is sitting or reclining'. This is not a correct division, since perhaps he is walking or standing. Know now that Division, if it falls into two parts only and fulfills the reality of nature in the Complete Division from which nothing deviates: if you validate one of the two parts, affirm it, and remove it from doubt, it produces for you that the other part is valid [invalid?] by necessity—it must be so [Context: Validating one invalidates the other in disjunctive, or validates the negation]. Like your saying: 'The world is either eternal or originated; but the world is originated, so it is correct that it is not eternal'. If you validate the negation of one of the two parts and affirm it, it produces by necessity the validity of the other division. Like your saying: 'The world is either eternal or originated; but it is not eternal, so it is correct that it is originated'. Likewise if the parts are more than two; if you validate one of them, it is correct that it is contrary to the rest—it must be so. Also, if you validate the negation of all those parts except one, it is correct that its judgment is that one which remained by necessity. If you validate that its judgment is contrary to some of those parts and more than one remains, the parts which became correct that it is contrary to drop, and it is not correct that the judgment of the thing whose [58r] validity of judgment is sought is in one of what remains excluding the rest of what remains. Do not mind which parts you advanced in wording nor which you delayed in all these aspects. We exemplify the three aspects we mentioned. We say, and by God Almighty we are supported: If you said 'This taste is either insipid, or acrid, or sweet, or bitter, or sour, or salty, or pungent, or astringent; but it is bitter', you have negated from it all remaining tastes with certainty, without doubt. Likewise if you said: 'This number is either equal to this number, or less than it, or more than it', [and you negate equal and less], you have negated the two remaining parts without doubt [error in text logic or translation of example intent], and it is then neither equal nor less with certainty.

    "text": "If you invalidate all parts except one, saying in the first question: 'But it is not insipid, nor acrid, nor sweet, nor bitter, nor sour, nor salty, nor pungent', then it is doubtlessly correct that it is astringent. Likewise, if you said in the second: 'But it is not more than it nor equal to it', then it is correct that it is less than it with certainty. If you invalidate some parts and remain silent about more than one of them, only the parts you validated as contrary to it drop, and you have not affirmed one specifically among what you did not negate. Inference and examination remain obligatory regarding them. Like your saying in the first question: 'But it is not bitter nor sweet', so bitterness and sweetness drop from it, and the taste remains doubtful regarding the remaining parts. Whenever you drop a part, it remains suspended on the rest until only one remains; then it is correct that that one is its judgment. This is in all issues. I only extracted all aspects for you from one issue so you see the ratio of aspects to one another more enablingly and easily than if they were from various issues. If you mention two or more of the many parts with a particle of doubt, saying: 'But it is either sweet or sour or bitter', you have invalidated the rest, and the judgment remains suspended on what you restricted it to. Know that this chapter is not correct unless you mention all parts that Nature necessitates. If you begin by mentioning some parts, restricting to them in the division, you have performed poorly. The correct way is that it is prevented except from one direction which you should not shrink from: that the validity of one of the parts you mentioned happens to agree with the thing whose judgment validity you seek. For if you validate that specific matching part [58v], you encounter the truth not by doing well in hitting it, but like a person whom searching led to a treasure. That is like your saying: 'This thing is either hot or cold; but it is hot'. If you were correct in describing it with heat as the reality of its nature, that produced for you the invalidity of every part you mentioned or did not mention. But if you negated in this operation one of the two parts you mentioned, nothing is valid for you yet. That is like your saying: 'This thing is either hot or cold; but it is not hot'. Know that you have not yet hit upon the reality of its nature, nor affirmed cold for it, because you dropped the third part which is the Moderate (Temperate). Perhaps it is moderate since it is not hot, so it would not enter the second part you mentioned, which is the Cold. Had your division been exhaustive, the ambiguity would have been lifted—as we presented before. If you decide in the incomplete division that it must be one of the parts...",

Memorize these meanings and distinguish them if they pass by you in all your pursuits. Inspect them in everything that comes to you; you will be illuminated in knowledge with a complete light and overlook wonders that relieve you of great worries if you are among those concerned with truths. Know that your bringing in the division the word 'Imma' (Either), or the word 'Aw' (Or), or 'It is not devoid of such and such', or 'It must be such and such', or 'This divides into such and such, a part of it is such and a part is such', or 'There is no way to other than such and such', or whatever gives the meaning—all that is equal. Nothing of that disrupts the meaning at all. 3 - Chapter on Types of Demonstration in which Attributes are Doubled: Know that premises may occur with a ratio of numbers in multitude or paucity or equality, or a disparity of qualities in intensity or weakness or their similarity. Some of them are a correct presentation producing a correct production returning to the First Figure. Like your saying: 'The Narcissus is more yellow [59r] than the Apple, and the Apple is more yellow than the Citron. Conclusion: So the Narcissus is more yellow than the Citron.' The Middle Term—which is the word shared in both premises, which I have long explained to you describing the moods of the three Figures—is our saying: 'The Apple'. Our saying 'more yellow' is the intended purpose and the link between the two terms; so it must come out in the Conclusion like the exit of the word 'All' or 'Some' in the previous Figures. The Divided Terms are the two words each premise was unique with, which are the Narcissus and the Citron. It may come with a correct symmetrical wording, so you say: 'The ratio of Five to Ten is like the ratio of Two to Four. Conclusion: So Five is half of Ten.' Thus if you likened a quality to a certain quality, then likened that second quality to another quality, that produces for you the likeness of...",

Conclusion: So Zayd's whiteness is like Khalid's whiteness.' This Conjunction gave the Five that it is half of the Ten, and also gave it that it has a ratio of a number resembling the ratio of another number. Likewise, the other gave that Zayd's whiteness resembles Amr's whiteness and resembles Khalid's whiteness. This is a place where one should be cautious, for some fools might use sophistry in it, as Al-Nashi' nicknamed Abu al-Abbas did when he said: 'If ten times ten is a hundred, then five times five is fifty.' That is because fifty is half of a hundred and five is half of ten, and the ratio of ten to a hundred is like the ratio of fifty to fifty [sic, text error?], and the ratio of five to ten is like the ratio of fifty to a hundred. This fallacious illusion only occurred because the speaker used an unclear wording in the premise. The correct way was to say: 'If ten repeated ten times is a hundred, then five repeated five times is twenty-five.' But people of the art of calculation abbreviated the lengthiness with a word they agreed to establish for understanding among themselves. They are not obliged more than clarifying to the ignorant only. Guard also against bringing different sentences. The meaning of that is that the attribute you describe the Reported About with in this type of Demonstration is different, so an error is generated upon you from that. Like your saying: 'The Rose is better in scent than the Lavender, and the Lavender is weaker in scent than the Musk.' This is a corrupt composition [59v] because the right of these Conjunctions is that the attribute be of one type except in degree only, because it is the Middle Term. It is not permissible except to be with one word in one meaning. The Middle Term in these two propositions is different: one is 'better in scent' and the second is 'weaker in scent'. This is not shared; both are different; the limit of Conjunction is not complete in them. Therefore, the result came out corrupt in some places. Perhaps it is true, but it is not trusted as we presented. It may be true once and false another. Do you not see that if you said: 'The Rose is better in scent than the Lavender, and the Lavender is weaker in scent than the Violet', Conclusion: 'So the Rose is better than the Violet' is true. If you said 'The Rose is better in scent than the Lavender, and the Lavender is weaker in scent than the Violet', Conclusion: 'So the Rose is better...",

If you said: 'The Rose is better in scent than the Lavender, and the Lavender is weaker in scent than the Musk', Conclusion: 'So the Rose is better in scent than the Musk' is false. If you commit to what I defined for you, you will always be truthful without doubt. That is to say: 'The Rose is better in scent than the Lavender, and the Lavender is better in scent than the Basil (Daymaran), so the Rose is better in scent than the Basil'. This arrangement never betrays you. We exemplify that with a Sharia example. We say: If a deceiver deceived and said 'Ali is more in virtues than Al-Abbas, and Al-Abbas is less in virtues than Abu Bakr', wanting to conclude from that: 'So Ali is more in virtues than Abu Bakr', and said: 'My premises are both true', that is not permitted for him. It is said to him: Put in the place of Abu Bakr the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. For two true premises also come to you, then look what is produced. You say: 'Ali is more in virtues than Al-Abbas, and Al-Abbas is less in virtues than the Messenger of God, peace be upon him'. These are two true premises. 'So Ali is more in virtues than the Messenger of God, peace be upon him'. This is a lie and disbelief. He is not left to take in the conclusion of one conjunction what the Reported About was described with in the first premise, and in the conclusion of another conjunction what the Reported About was described with in the second premise—like taking the mention of 'More' in one and 'Less' in the second. But what he wants from that is reversed upon him, so his deception appears shortly. Until if you make the judgment of the Middle Term one in wording, you are correct. That is like your saying: 'Ali is more in virtues than Abu Hurayrah, and Abu Hurayrah is more [60r] in virtues than Mu'awiyah. Conclusion: So Ali is better than Mu'awiyah'. This arrangement never betrays you. Two attributes became valid for you for the Reported About in this type of Demonstration: One is his superiority over the one you related him from, and the second is his superiority over the one you related to, who you related from first. Therefore, we titled it first that attributes are doubled in it. By God Almighty is success. 4 - Chapter on Types of Demonstration whose Premises Differ in Appearance but the Purpose in their Negation and Affirmation is One: This is a type of establishing Demonstration that is always true if arranged well.

    "text": "...existents are a thing that never ceased to be (Eternal). No existent is except the Creator, Substance, and Accident. That which never ceased to be is not Substance nor Accident. Conclusion: So He is the Creator, Mighty and Majestic. The first premise of these three premises is of the type we mentioned before this, connecting its end to the beginning of this chapter, which gives the Reported About more than one attribute. Do you not see that you affirmed for the Reported About that He never ceased to be, and that He is existent, and that He is a Creator, there is no god but He. The third premise is of the Disjunctive propositions; you validated in it the negation of Him being Substance or Accident, so it became necessary that the third part by necessity is the Creator, Mighty and Majestic. The second middle premise is of the two mentioned types; you took from the type giving the Reported About more than one attribute—like your saying in it that He never ceased to be and is not Substance nor Accident—and took from the Disjunctive your saying 'Not Substance and Not Accident', and also described the Existent therein as being more than one. These three premises produced one result. This type is frequently repeated in the folds of debate, frequently passing (1) during the search for requested truths. Because you are certain of the necessity of a certain thing, so you want to verify its attributes. You take every possible part the described could be described with, then negate from it what is valid to negate by correct evidences, until all are negated except one of them. That remaining one is the attribute of the thing whose true judgment you want to know. From that is that we say: One of [the people] killed Zayd (2). There was no one in the house except Yazid, Khalid, and Muhammad. Muhammad was sleeping, and Yazid was unconscious from an illness in him. Conclusion: [60v] So Khalid killed him. Premises here may be very many, and may be from all types of Demonstration, producing a correct production according to what we mentioned of the rank of every type of Demonstration in its chapter. From this chapter, it is understood that the father has two-thirds from the saying of God Almighty: {And his parents inherit from him, so for his mother is one-third} (4 An-Nisa: 11). That is because the money is a third and two-thirds. The money belongs to the parents, and for the mother from it is the third. Conclusion: So the two-thirds are for the father.

    "text": "5 - Chapter on Types of Demonstration whose Premises are Many, and each Premise necessitates the Premise following it: An example of that is you say: If eating is excessive, indigestion is necessary. If indigestion is necessary, the stomach weakens. If the stomach weakens, bad digestion is necessary. If bad digestion is necessary, sickness is necessary. Conclusion: So the existence of excessive eating necessitates excessive sickness. This is a correct demonstration because corruption of digestion does not exist except with sickness of the stomach; sickness of the stomach does not exist except with bad digestion; indigestion does not exist except with corruption of the stomach; and increase above the amount agreeing with the power of nature does not exist except with indigestion. What does not exist except another thing exists with its existence, and the second also if it exists necessitates a third, then the third does not exist except by the existence of the first. This also is something one should be cautious in placing its premises so that a false premise does not enter them. For if a speaker said: 'If lack of money is found, poverty is found; and if poverty is found, need is existing', and wanted to conclude from that: 'If lack of money is found, need is existing', this is false. Because lack of money is not poverty; a man may be a craftsman and possessor of (1) sufficiency, needing no one and having no excess. But if you said: 'If the state of falling short of sufficiency is found, poverty is found; and if poverty is found, need is found', that would produce a correct production, which is: 'If the state of falling short of sufficiency is found, need is found'. One should be cautious of such things from Homonymous Names general to meanings, so verifying their meanings with words specific to them. And be cautious of Universal Attributes, so do not apply them by their generality to some of what is under them excluding others. Some opponents deceived, saying to invalidate this Demonstration: 'If [61r] fire is non-existent, heat is non-existent; and if heat is non-existent, we do not need cooling'. He wanted to conclude: 'If fire is non-existent, we do not need cooling'. This is a lie because the feverish and the one in summer need cooling, and no fire is apparent with them. This is because the first premise is a lie. The correct way is to say: 'If fire is non-existent, the heat generated from it is non-existent'.",

Every eye (person) permissible for the intercourser is a marriage-bed. Everything not a marriage-bed is adultery. The shared maidservant is adultery. Every possessor of adultery is an adulterer. So every intercourser with a shared maidservant is an adulterer. Every adulterer has the stone (punishment/deprivation). So every intercourser with a shared maidservant has the stone. These premises all produced that every intercourser with a shared maidservant has the stone. 6 - Chapter on Demonstration Conditional in Wording, Categorical in Meaning: Its example: If describing a thing with Intoxication is a description with Prohibition, and fig wine (Nabidh) if it ferments is described with Intoxication, then Prohibition is necessary for fig wine if it ferments. This, as you see, its appearance is that the description with Prohibition is only suspended on Intoxication. If you want to make it Categorical in its wording, you say: Prohibition is the ruling of every intoxicant; some intoxicants are fig wine if it ferments; so Prohibition is the ruling of fig wine if it ferments. A group of rioters used sophistry in this chapter saying: You have decided that two negatives do not produce a trusted production, yet in some of these chapters you established, you produce a consistent production from two negatives. And in this chapter also, like your saying: 'Whoever is not laughing is not human; the horse is not laughing; so the horse is not human'. And you say: 'Everyone who does not believe is not accepted by God Almighty; the idolater is not a believer; so he is not accepted by God Almighty'. The answer, and by God Almighty is success: The Negation from which we excluded establishing consistent Demonstration is every pure negation, which is every negation [not] affirming an attribute for the Reported About at all. Whether the negation is of this description—meaning with a wording of negation or a wording of affirmation—it never produces anything. We will mention something of this in a separate chapter in this register regarding the confusions [61v] some sophists attempted in Figures, God Almighty willing. As for what was Negation in wording while affirming a meaning and an attribute for the Reported About, it is not Negation but a correct Affirmation. One only observes the meaning the word gives, not the form of the word alone. Hence, it does not bind us to liken the Creator Almighty [to creation] in our negating from Him things that are also negated from many in...",

That does not necessitate likening Him Almighty, like our saying: 'The Creator Almighty is not a body', and 'The Accident is not a body'; 'The Creator Almighty is not an Accident', and 'The Body is not an Accident'. Because in this judgment we did not affirm for the Creator a state in which He shares with the Accident since we negated Bodily-ness from Him, nor with the Body since we negated Accident-ness from Him. This is the pure, abstract Negation. As for the propositions we mentioned just now, we affirmed Laughter for whoever is human, and affirmed for the Horse the negation of Humanity, and affirmed for it with every resemblance with everyone who is not laughing that they are not humans. Likewise, we affirmed for whoever does not believe the opposite of Acceptance, which is Disavowal (Tabarru'). We affirmed for whoever does not believe the opposite of Acceptance, which is Disavowal [Repetition in text]. And we affirmed the opposite of Faith, which is Disbelief, for the Idolater. We presented that if the meaning is restricted to two things, and you negate one of them, you have affirmed the other by necessity—so memorize this. If you negated both, you affirmed nothing at all. If you negated, you have affirmed by necessity; and if you affirmed the Negation, you have negated without doubt. Cultivate all this; it produces your certainty in the validity of your knowledge. 7 - Chapter on Demonstration Taken from a False Conclusion by Validating its Negation: Know that if one of the premises is a lie and the other is truth, and they produced a false conclusion of apparent falsehood, and the lying premise was what your opponent accepted, you indulge him in that to show him the obscenity of his production. Because if a thing is false, its negation is true without doubt. So if a conclusion is false, its negation is true. Taking Demonstration in this manner may be valid with a consistent validity trusted always. Example of that: A person opposed you saying: 'The world is eternal'. You said to him: I indulge you in the criticism of this premise, so I say: 'The world is eternal'. I add to it another correct one which is: 'The Eternal is not composed'. The Result: 'The world is not composed'. This is an apparent lie. If this is a lie, its contradictory is true, which is 'The world is composed'. If this is true, and we have presented that 'The Eternal is not composed', it is correct that 'The world is not eternal' since it is composed. The falsehood of his premise appeared when he said: 'The world is eternal'. This is a correct inference that [62r] never betrays, since it takes the opposite of the conclusion and returns the conclusion to absurdity.

Then we add to this premise a correct, certain premise which is: 'And Three is a number, and Number is composed of its parts equal to its whole'. So Three is composed of its parts equal to its totality. You said 'The First is Three', so 'The First is composed of its parts equal to its totality and whole'. Yet you and we are certain that 'The First is non-composed and non-possessor of parts'. So 'The First is composed possessor of parts, non-composed and non-possessor of parts'. This is impossible. Since this is impossible, and it is correct that He is [not?] composed [Text says 'correct that he is composed', context implies logical reductio leading to negation], it is correct that He is not a number. Since it is correct that He is not Three, the falsehood of your corrupt premise appeared. By God Almighty is success. 8 - Chapter on Demonstration Composed of Many Conclusions Taken from Various Premises: Example of that is to say: Every counted thing possesses two ends (limits), and every possessor of two ends is finite; so every counted thing is finite. Then we take the conclusion of this first demonstration and say: Every counted thing is finite, and every finite thing possesses parts; the Conclusion: Every counted thing possesses parts. Then we take the conclusion of this second demonstration and say: Every counted thing possesses parts, and every possessor of parts is composed; Conclusion: So every counted thing is composed. And every composed thing is accompanied by composition; Conclusion: Every counted thing is accompanied by composition. Then we take this fourth demonstration and say: Every counted thing is accompanied by composition, and every accompanied by composition [is preceded by composition? or did not precede composition]; Conclusion: So every counted thing did not precede composition. Then we take the conclusion of this fifth demonstration saying: Every counted thing did not precede composition. Then we take this sixth demonstration saying: The world did not precede the Originated, and what did not precede the Originated is originated like it. Conclusion: So the world is originated. In this chapter, premises may come to you as Categorical, Conditional, Conjunctive, Disjunctive, and Inference by the contrary of what comes out in the conclusion. In general, it disposes for you in all types of Demonstration. All of that, if you take it according to the conditions we presented, its production is trusted. Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds.",

This meaning is taken from Equivalents and from Conversion of Propositions, and we have mentioned them. This is like your saying: 'It is not permissible for the Eternal to be composed'. Enfolded for us in this speech is that 'It is not permissible for the Composed to be Eternal' by necessity, inevitably. Enfolded in it also is that 'The Composed is Originated'. Likewise if you said: 'Every intoxicant is forbidden', enfolded in it is that 'The intoxicant is not lawful', and 'What is not forbidden is not intoxicant' [Logic check: Contrapositive]. Enfolded in it also is that 'Date wine if it intoxicates is forbidden', 'Henbane if it intoxicates is forbidden', 'Apple wine if it intoxicates is forbidden', and so on. Just as if you said: 'Zayd is walking', enfolded for you in it is that he is moving, possesses a healthy leg, and is alive, and many things. Therefore, a group possessing rioting and ignorance thought that we are mistaken in our saying that 'The single proposition produces', and they refused what we mentioned. Their thought is not correct because all we mentioned is not 'Production' (Inference/Syllogism), since the condition of the meaning of Production is that we benefit from the gathering of both propositions a meaning not enfolded in one of them at all. For if you said: 'Every intoxicant is forbidden', there is no affirmation in it that 'Date wine intoxicates' inevitably at all, but until you utter it and validate for it that it may intoxicate. If you made this attribute for it, then you decide for it Prohibition without condition. Otherwise, in your saying 'Every intoxicant is forbidden' is only the possibility that it intoxicates, not the necessity; since in the world are many things that do not intoxicate, so perhaps it is one of them. Ponder this, leave indulgence, and verify. This which we mentioned in this chapter regarding propositions understood from propositions not uttered is only 'Enfoldment' (Intiwa') in them. The meaning of Enfoldment is that we [pointed] to many meanings and expressed them with one word seeking brevity. In general, reporting about their particulars enters into reporting about their totality. Like their saying: 'Human is living'; you have reported that Zayd and Amr are living, and Hind is living, and in general every man and woman, because they are parts of Human. Understand this. Likewise, enfolded in every proposition is the invalidation of its opposite. Like the saying of God Almighty: {Indeed, Abraham was forbearing, grieving} (9 At-Tawbah: 114). Enfolded in it is the negation of the opposite of Forbearance, which is Foolishness. So enfolded...",

    "text": "...in it is that Abraham is not foolish. As for Production (Inference), it is contrary to that, which is what we have explained. Praise be to God. Know also that not every time [63r] the speech you want to make a premise comes to you in the arrangement we presented to you in taking Demonstration. Rather, sayings contradicting those ranks come to you in three ways. One way is contrary to all we mentioned in rank and meaning; do not pay attention to it, and verify the rank and truth upon the conditions we presented to you, for no Demonstration stands for you from other than what we said at all. Another way contains extra words that neither fix the meaning nor corrupt it; if you remained silent about them, you would not need them nor mind them. You undertake taking Demonstration from the rest of the correct speech. Those extra words only give a meaning that is not in anything. From this place, establishing the Hadd (punishment) is affirmed for us by the testimony of two witnesses who agreed on what necessitates the Hadd, then differed in attributes having no meaning in the testimony, while the testimony is complete without them. Like two witnesses testifying against Zayd that he stole a cow; one said 'Yellow' and the other said 'Black'. Its being yellow or black is not what contradicts his stealing it nor negates it—we mean his stealing it—and the speech is complete without mentioning any of that. From this same chapter and its opposite, we invalidated the confession of one who confessed an impossibility, like one who said: 'So-and-so, I killed him with my magic', because of our knowledge that magic does not kill. The addition he added is corrupting the meaning, so it is a corrupt premise. If he confessed once saying: 'I killed him with a sword', and said another time: 'I killed him with a spear', it would be a valid confession because none of these additions contradicts the killing; his silence about them and his mentioning them is equal since there is nothing in mentioning them that corrupts the premise. Similar to this is what people of sects opposing us mention, that the world since it originated has [existed] seven thousand years. Others said five thousand years. Others said six thousand years. Others said four hundred thousand years. We said: We have no limit regarding that. It is possible it is multiples of multiples of all these numbers, and possible it is less than that. All these sayings do not impugn (1) our agreement that the world has a First and a Beginning. These...",

    "text": "...are all words regarding which we do not say they merely do not corrupt the Beginning and Origination, but we do not restrict to all that so we say: Rather, all of them, despite their difference, necessitate Origination and Beginning. So we are not harmed by the difference of such words, nor their increase, nor their decrease, if they give the correctness of the sought meaning and do not corrupt it. The third way is that a wording comes for which Demonstration has established the obligation of submission to it, so it needs to be taken in the premises between us and those who oppose us [63v] in some opinions among those who acknowledge with us that wording and submit to it. In that wording is a clear omission (deletion) and a word whose mention was left out. Our opponent cannot deny that, and that omission harms nothing; it is as if it were mentioned with no difference, if its being established in the meaning is certain. That is like a premise we take from the saying of God Almighty: {And if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and find no water, then seek clean earth} [4 An-Nisa: 43]. There is no doubt for the hearer of this verse, if he has the slightest understanding of the Arabic tongue and the least knowledge of the Islamic creed, that here is a meaning we pointed to by necessity which was omitted from the wording, sufficing with the fact that it is not hidden at all. It is \"Fa-ahdathtum\" (and you became ritually impure). The place of the meaning of this word is between \"Journey\" and \"Or comes\". Likewise, if we needed another premise from His saying Almighty: {That is the expiation for your oaths when you have sworn} [5 Al-Ma'idah: 89]. There is no doubt for one who has a tongue among the people of the Islamic creed and Arabic language that the meaning is \"Fa-hanithtum\" (and you broke the oath). Omission may be on another rank, which is that the wording in the structure of the language necessitates a link to a meaning not mentioned, which must be corrected. Like the speaker saying: 'So-and-so repented'; it is not confused to a hearer that he sinned. 'So-and-so apostatized'; it is not confused to a hearer that he had been a Muslim. 'This money is weighed'; it is not confused to a hearer that it is by a scale. Like this is much. Such omission does not harm the speech at all; the speech is correct. Taking premises from it for Demonstration is obligatory, and affirming the meaning for the omitted part is necessary. No one makes excuses in such omission except a dull ignoramus, a silly stubborn person, or an interrupted sneaker-away (1). Likewise if you said: 'Zayd struck Amr with the sword and separated his head', you produced that 'Zayd killed Amr'. This is a true, correct production and correct presentation. It does not harm you if you omitted from the premise: 'And everyone whose head is separated is killed', and 'Everyone who separated...",

Those are ten} (2 Al-Baqarah: 196). This is a correct production sufficing instead of saying: 'Seven and three is equal to ten, so those are ten', due to the correctness of knowledge of that. Understand now from this chapter that contradicting the ranks presented is only in three ways: Corruption of rank and meaning, so discard it. Increase of wording; if it corrupts the meaning, discard it; if it does not corrupt, do not mind (1) it, for it will not harm you. Omission from wording; if it corrupts the meaning, discard it; if it does not corrupt the meaning, do not mind it [64r], for it will not harm you. Cultivate all this, for the benefit in it is very great. Know that if the opponent acknowledges to you the two premises which are upon the conditions of correctness we presented, but denies the Conclusion, he has contradicted himself, fallen, and his saying is void. Likewise, if the Conclusion is false as we presented, it is obligatory on him to believe its opposite, as we presented regarding the Demonstration taken from the false Conclusion where you indulge the opponent in one of the premises. If he believes that opposite, he has returned to the truth, and it binds him to declare his corrupt premise a lie. If he believes the Conclusion and does not retract declaring his corrupt premise a lie, he has believed the thing and its opposite, or denied them both. Speech with him has become silly and fallen, and the invalidity of his saying has appeared. By God Almighty is success, and to Him belongs the command before and after, there is no god but He. Do not err and estimate that whoever agreed with you in your saying, what bound you binds him. This is ignorance from the one who wants to bind his opponent with that, or rioting. Know that the agreement of opponent to opponent is divided into two parts: One is agreement in the Conclusion only without agreement with him in the Premises producing the Conclusion. This is what we told you not to regard, since he only agreed with you on that due to his presenting other premises that produced that result—either they are corrupt or your premises are corrupt. For this, even if his premises entered him into agreeing with you now, they will exit him shortly to disagreeing with you. The second way is that he agrees with you on your premises. This is the necessary agreement by which the proof is established if they are correct in general, or...",

If a speaker says: 'How do premises differ and produce one [result], especially when one operation in some premises is truth and the second operation is falsehood, so truth and falsehood produce a single production?' Let him remember what we mentioned before beginning to mention the Moods of Figures: that corrupt premises may produce a correct production. We explained it there. What we mention after this chapter is mentioned there: presenting two negative premises. So we say to you: 'Not every human is a stone (1), and not every stone is inanimate'. Result: 'Not every human is inanimate'. We said there that this is a deceptive, treacherous presentation, because if you trusted it and submitted to it, he would present to you like it saying: 'Not every human is black, and not every black thing is living'. Result: 'Not every black thing is living' [Text error: Result should be 'Not every human is living', which is false]. This is a corrupt presentation. It may produce a production agreeing [64v] with the correct production in some places, except that if you follow it, just as it entered you into truth in a place, it exits you from it in another. We explained this there and in the chapter following this chapter, and we left no way for ambiguity against you. The Jews often argue against us that we have agreed with them that their religion was true and their prophet true, and they want from here to bind us to acknowledging it even now. Grasp this place and know that we only agreed with them on their premises, which are premises that produced for us agreeing with them in what they mentioned. So strike away from those premises and following them in what they produced, and cling to the agreement in the Conclusion only. Do not be deceived in the Conclusion at all until the Premises are correct. We and they only corrected that 'Whoever is established to have come with miracles is a Prophet; Moses, peace be upon him, came with miracles, so Moses is a Prophet'. This premise itself produces the Prophethood of Muhammad, peace be upon him. We say: 'Everyone who came with a miracle is a Prophet, and Muhammad, peace be upon him, came with miracles, so he is a Prophet'. Grasp this very well. We have agreed with the Proponents of Analogy (Qiyas) in many results, except that their premises are other than our premises. It is not obligatory that our binding them or their binding us—lifting the riot with those results—is binding, but until we agree on the premises necessitating them.

The Kharijite said: 'Traditions and verses have been authenticated that the Killer burns therein except the most wretched who denied and turned away. So the Killer is the most wretched who denied and turned away.' The Murji'ite said: 'Traditions and verses have been authenticated that the Acknowledger of Tawhid and Faith enters Paradise, and the Fire is burned therein by none except the most wretched who denied and turned away. The Adulterer did not deny nor turn away, so the Adulterer does not burn therein.' Know that this is of the Demonstration I alerted you to—so remember it (1)—when I informed you that among accepted premises is speech containing omission. The omission in these premises which the ignorant estimated produced a different production is something Demonstration has indicated. It is the intent: 'He does not burn therein', and that it is specifically among the fires of Hell; no one burns in *that* fire except people of this description. It is not in this that *every* fire in Hell is burned therein only by people of this description. This is also something one should be cautious of by exhausting all that is connected to the premises; otherwise, it is an incomplete premise. It is not accepted by us in this verse alone, but [65r] many verses and many reports. We join them all to one another and do not take some speech without some, corrupting meanings. I warn you against the rioting of a group who, if they debate, seize upon it being a single verse or a single hadith. This is a severe fall and excessive ignorance, since what they seized upon is not more worthy to be taken as a premise to whose production one returns than other verses and other hadiths. This is arbitrariness and sophistry, so beware of it also greatly. 10 - Chapter on Fallacies We Cited Fearing a Rioter May Riot with Them in Demonstration: One should be cautious of fallacies and rioting used by rioters (2) in converting premises and in Figures. We have mentioned a part in some past chapters. From that is that we said: The Universal Negative converts to Universal Negative. If a speaker says to you: 'No Persian except a Non-Arab ('Ajam)'; this is true. Its conversion 'No Non-Arab except a Persian' is a lie. So be alert to the place of fallacy. Know that this proposition is Affirmative not Negative, even if its appearance is Negation.

    "text": "...two premises whose appearance is that they are Negative. That clarifies this place for you. We increase clarification here, so we say: Do you not see that you have affirmed Non-Arabness for every Persian? This is Universal Affirmative and not Negative at all. Since it is so, its conversion is Particular Affirmative, which is your saying: 'And some Non-Arabs are Persian'. Likewise your saying: 'Not a thing of Substances is carried in an Accident'; this is true. If you converted and said: 'And not a thing of Accidents is carried in a Substance', this is a lie. Understand the place of fallacy in this chapter. It is that the Conversion whose ruling we mentioned in Negatives and validated is only the negation of the resemblance of the two Essences or the negation of the resemblance of their parts. We did not intend the negation of the resemblance of other than them. Here, you only negated the resemblance of the *place* of the Substance to the *place* of the Accident. Their place is other than them, and the place of every thing is other than the thing in the place without doubt. Be cautious also of the fallacy occurring in converting the Universal Affirmative. It may be said to you: 'Is not every past of time having been future?' You must say Yes. It is said to you: 'So some future has been past?' This is a lie. Be cautious of the place of fallacy here. It is that the erroneous speech entered only from equating two times which are other than the two attributes which are Past-ness and Future-ness. For Past-ness is a report about a thing that was existing; [it is] a state. As for Future, because the Future is non-existence, and there is no state for non-existence. The wording of [65v] the two Reported About necessitates their difference, not equating (1) them. The correction of that is to say: 'Some future becomes past'; this is correct. Be cautious also of an error occurring in converting the Particular Affirmative. Example: 'Some wine has been juice'. If you said: 'Some juice has been wine', you lied. The error here is from equating the two times of the two Reported About, while their time is other than them. Conversion is only valid in attributes adhering to the two Reported About, not in attributes adhering to others. The correction of that is to say: 'And some juice became wine or becomes wine'. Memorize now that Conversion is only in Essences or Attributes adhering to Essences. A group also used fallacy [from] some fools whose doctrine is spoiling truths and running to no goal, seeking what he does not know—so how about others? He said: The First Figure may lie. He says: 'The horse alone is neighing, and the neighing is living (animal); so the horse alone is living'. The error here came only from an addition added spoiling the meaning, which is 'Alone'.

Know that the Described in the Conclusion does not necessitate that that attribute is only for it inevitably; rather, it may encompass it and encompass others. We increase clarification for you to strengthen your caution against the confusion of everyone who does not fear God Almighty in striving to spoil truths among the deceivers who are more deserving of punishment than deceivers in cash and sales. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: \"Whoever cheats us is not of us.\" No cheat is greater than cheating in invalidating truths. We say, and by God Almighty is success: Contemplate the weakness of this deceiver. If he decides that 'The horse alone is neighing', it becomes correct without doubt that 'The neighing alone is a horse', because neighing is an attribute equal to the horse, not more general than it—we alerted you to this in the chapter of Converting Propositions. When this deceiver brought a proposition necessitating that 'The neighing alone is a horse', he said: 'And the neighing is living', after stipulating the uniqueness of the neighing to horseness. He inserted in his saying 'The neighing is living' that it is the neighing intended by mention in the first premise. He necessitated by the rank of his wording that the description of the neighing with life is an equal description, because it is a more general description. So he became a sayer of 'The neighing alone is living'. This second premise is camouflaged as you see; it is false because it was placed in a position of falsehood and made to resemble truths. Due to the falsehood of the premise, the conclusion was false. I have explained [66r] to you that the falsehood of the second premise was only because he built it universal in wording upon a particular described object. Understand this and be very cautious of the people of stupidity. The correct way was to say in the Conclusion: 'So the horse is living', and not mention 'Alone'. Because 'Alone' in reality with 'Neighing' is a report about the horse. The word 'Alone' is not a follower of the Horse to be mentioned in the Conclusion, but it is a follower of the Neighing—which is the Middle Term. Had he mentioned it in the second premise with the Neighing saying: 'The horse alone is neighing, and it alone is neighing living, so the horse is living', he would have been correct. From that also, if a speaker said while pointing to a specific man: 'The human is a doctor', this wording would be general while its interior is Specificity. If he carried upon it a description that must only apply to a general meaning, he would be lying. Some sophists asked a doctor saying to him: 'Does heat dissolve cold?' He said Yes. He said: 'And does cold dissolve heat?' He said Yes. He said: 'So heat is cold and cold is heat.' The doctor said to him: 'The two modes of their dissolving are different.

He said Yes. He said: 'And is the dog alive?' He said Yes. He said: 'So you are the dog and the dog is you.' Know that these two riots are from the Second Figure. He performed poorly in their arrangement because the condition in the Second Figure is that one of its premises must be Negative inevitably. Understand this and grasp it; it will never betray you. Do not pay attention to the people of rioting, for such people only run the course of jesters for silly kings and entertainers for weak obeyed ones; they are not of the people of truths at all, so do not care about them a bit. They also said: We have found two Affirmatives that do not produce [truth]: 'It is impossible that the human be a stone' and 'It is impossible that the stone be living'. These are two true [premises]. Result: 'It is impossible that the human be living'. This is a lie. Understand also the place of fallacy here is: These two premises are Negative with a pure negation having nothing of Affirmation at all. We said that two Negatives do not produce. We mentioned to you before that what is observed is only the reality of the meaning understood from the word, not the form of the word alone. These two premises, even if they are with the wording of Affirmation, their meaning is Pure Negation because they negated from [66v] the Human Stoniness and from the Stone Life, and did not affirm for a stone nor for a human a meaning at all other than what their names affirmed for them only. They also used fallacy saying: 'Every braying thing is living, and not one of humans is braying living'. These are two true [premises]. Result: 'So not one of humans is living'. This is a lie. The fallacy only came from the Attribute with which the Braying was described, which also encompasses with it the thing from which Braying was negated. This is the worst arrangement. He should have shared it with what is not shared by the one from whom he negated sharing it entirely in the second premise. From this chapter is that we say: 'Not every taker of money without its right is a thief; and every taker of money without its right while knowing is a debauchee'. These are two true [premises]. Result: 'So not every taker of money without its right while knowing it is a debauchee'. This is a lie. The fallacy only came because you described taking money without right in the Affirmative premise with an attribute encompassing it and encompassing every thief with it. You should have described it with what is not shared by the one from whom you negated sharing it in the other. They also used fallacy by dropping something from the Described.

This is an ugly fallacy, because the Subject—which is the Reported About intended by description in the first premise—is only the Bones, because he negated Hair from them. Then he affirmed the mention of Bones in the second premise in that he described their place only. We presented that the Relation by Affirmation is only in the Essences of the Reported About and in the Attributes adhering to them, not in their places. However, if you corrected, you would say: 'So hair is not in any of the bones of the human'. Also, the power of these two premises is a Particular power because bones are some of the parts of the human, not in all of him. Remember what we told you before: that the Middle Term must be Reported About in one premise and Report in the other, or Reported About in both, or Report in both. If it is Reported About in one and Report in the second, look: If both are Affirmative, the description by it of what was described must be essential general to all of it; and the Reported About must also be generalized in the other premise by what became a description for it therein. If one of them is Negative, let the Negation you described the Negated-from in one of the premises be negated in reality from it and from the other by that Described in this [67r], because the Described thing in one of the premises is an Attribute in the other. If it is Described in both premises, one of the premises must be Negative. Then what you negated in the one will be general to what you negated it from, and negated from the Described in the second, according to what is stipulated in it.

It is known by primary reason that from the Word, its meaning is [understood], not part of its meaning nor none of its meaning. Therefore, languages were established so that meanings are understood from words. The third part is Particular in Wording, Universal in Meaning. It is what the Wording came with regarding some of the species not all, but that judgment includes the rest of that species. This is not known [67v] from that Particular Wording, but from another incoming word to transfer the judgment of this Particular to the rest of the Species. The fourth part is Universal in Wording, Particular in Meaning. It is what came with a general wording while the intent is some of what that wording necessitated. However, this section and the [previous] one, their meanings are not understood from their wordings at all, but by a demonstration from another word, or intuition of reason, or sense. All that clarifies that only some of what that word necessitates was intended by it. Were it not for the Demonstration we mentioned, it would not be permissible at all to transfer it from its place in the language, nor to specialize some of what is named by it excluding the rest of all that is named by that word. As for the type which is Universal in Wording, Particular in Meaning, it is like people's saying in customary...",

    "text": "...address: \"People are corrupted\"; the meaning is only some of them. This is by intuition of reason, because people do not become corrupted all of them except by the departure of virtues entirely. Virtues are genera and species arranged in the structure of the world, and there is no way for an entire species to be non-existent completely such that it is not found in the world at all. And like the speaker saying: \"Water is life for the thirsty\"; he only means some waters. This is known by sense because seawater and bitter waters are not life for the thirsty. Of this type is the saying of God Almighty: {Those to whom the people said, 'Indeed, the people have gathered against you'} (3 Aal Imran: 173). This is known by reason that He Almighty only meant some people, because the meeting of all people informing them is impossible. From that is the saying of God Almighty: {When you stand up for prayer, wash your faces} (5 Al-Ma'idah: 6). The intent of that is only some states of standing for prayer, not others, which is the state of a person being in ritual impurity; this is only known by another clarification. Know that the meaning of this word is what we mentioned. This is used greatly in speech, except that there must be a proof diverting it from what was established as an expression for it in the language; otherwise, it is arbitrariness from its claimer and corruption of the clarity by which understanding occurs. I wish I knew: If the word is not an expression for the meaning, and every meaning does not have a known expression... (text unclear: 'ah'?), then what does he want to do with these words which... (text unclear: 'r'?) carries them on the basis that their universality... (text unclear)? Or he says by suspension (Tawaqquf) until the intent appears to him? And by what does he want to distinguish between meanings according to his claim? Does he find anything other than another word? And is that other word, in the possibility of doubt regarding the intent by it and its meaning, except like this first word with no difference? And so on forever. If this were correct, our superiority over beasts would be void, since understanding did not occur for us by names applying to named things. The rational person should not be pleased for himself [68r] with any speech that leads him to invalidating understanding, for that is an exit from the culture of reason and mockery of the blessings of the First One who favored us with these great powers by which we deserved that He addresses us. Among what exited by correct evidences from some of what its apparent wording necessitates is His saying Almighty in the verse of prohibition: {And your mothers who suckled you and your sisters through nursing} (4 An-Nisa: 23). And His saying Almighty: {The [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilty of sexual intercourse - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes} (24 An-Nur: 2). {And the thief, male and female, cut their hands} (5 Al-Ma'idah: 38).",

    "text": "...and much of the like. Were it not for accepted proofs from other words clarifying to us that the intent by prohibition is some wet-nurses and sucklings, and some adulteresses and adulterers not others, and some thieves not others, it would have been obligatory to carry these words upon everything named by them, even if the Part also of these meanings is applied to by what applies to the Whole. As for the Particular Wording into which a Universal Meaning enters, it is His saying Almighty: {O you who have believed} (4 An-Nisa: 19) at the beginning of Surah An-Nisa, then the address continued to His saying Almighty: {Prohibited to you are your mothers} (4 An-Nisa: 23) the verse. Everything mentioned therein is prohibited for other than those who believed, but not by this wording, rather by other proofs from other words which also applied this judgment to those not named in this place. Were it not for those other words, those not named by the name of who was addressed would not have entered into this judgment at all. We only mentioned this section so an ignorant person does not think that this judgment transferred from this wording to other than whom it necessitates. If you want to present premises from the types we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter—and we have said that return is made to them regarding what is disputed—you say: 'Every intoxicant is wine (Khamr), and every wine is forbidden. Result: So every intoxicant is forbidden'. This is a Conjunction from the First Mood of the First Figure. If you wish, you say: 'Every thief of property equal to or more than a quarter of a dinar, cutting his hand is [obligatory] upon him; and Zayd stole something not less than a quarter of a dinar; so cutting his hand is [obligatory] upon Zayd'. Thus is done in all Commands, which is that the Command comes out with a Universal Report wording encompassing what the word necessitates, to which obedience is obligatory. Know that the Word, if it is of Homonymous words, runs upon all the types necessitated by that word—if capable of that—wherever they are found gathered or separate. No one has the right to say: 'I do not apply the judgment except upon the gathering of all meanings necessitated by the Name', because he becomes then contradictory to the judgment of the Name from where he estimated he is agreeing with it. Because every part of it, that Name applies [68v] to it. So if he does not apply it to that part if he finds it separate, he has prevented applying the Name to its generality and what it necessitates. This is invalidating the subject of the Name.

Because what exceeds this amount, one is not capable of fulfilling it. Incapacity is a preventing cause, and an utmost limit in clarifying that that wording was not intended for a generality that cannot be borne at all. That is like a speaker saying: 'Call the people for me to feed them'; there is no way to generalizing all people. This is only for a group to whom the name 'people' applies. Likewise where God Almighty mentioned 'The Needy' (Masakin) or 'The Poor' (Fuqara), since other than this is not bearable at all. Whoever tasks another with the Impossible has exited the boundary of one being spoken to. From the section which we said is a word encompassing possessors of various attributes is His saying Almighty where He mentioned 'Muhsanat' (Chaste/Protected women). It is not permissible to specialize some to whom this name applies excluding others, nor is it permissible to refrain from applying the judgment until all attributes gather, where every attribute of them is not Ihsan (protection/chastity) [alone]. But if one attribute or more is found, the name expressed by it becomes obligatory for it. It is a name applying to chaste women, free women, married women, and Muslim women—unless a wording comes preventing the generality of all we mentioned, so one stops at it as we presented. Likewise His saying Almighty: {And do not marry those [women] whom your fathers married} (4 An-Nisa: 22). Marriage (Nikah) applies to the valid contract and to intercourse, whether valid or invalid. So everyone the father had intercourse with by adultery or otherwise is forbidden to the son. You say in a premise of this chapter: 'Everything the father married of women is forbidden to the son; and Hind, Zayd's father married her; so Hind is forbidden to Zayd'. The Middle Term here is Marriage and Father. The Divided Terms: In the Major Premise are Women, Son, and Forbidden; and in the Minor are Zayd and Hind, which come out in the Result. Know that what I told you—that the Word applying to various types is upon its generality for all types under it, because they have no genus—is like the Word applying to the single Type in its generality of individuals, with no difference.

Then it is taken in that place specifically, not where that word is found in another place; for it is carried upon its generality for everything under it always. Because that proof which transferred it from its generality in the first place did not enter on the basis that it transferred it from its place in the language definitively, but it indicated that the intent by it in this place specifically is some of what its place in the language necessitates only. As for the speaker saying: 'So-and-so does not wrong [anyone] a grain of mustard', nothing is understood from that upon verification and abandoning looseness except what the wording necessitated specifically—that he does not wrong [regarding] mustard specifically. This is what the wording was established for in the language. It is not understood from that that he does not wrong in fortresses, estates, and houses, because estates and houses are not called 'mustard' at all. But if a speaker said: 'He does not wrong people a thing', or said 'He does not wrong in a thing', then he generalizes with negation everything upon which the name 'wrong' falls. If this is not so, it is because I attached a meaning in Names to Named things, and it was established in intellects that there is no clarification except by words expressing meanings assigned to them in the language. This is what no one knows other than it except one misleading himself, stubborn against his sense, indulgent where indulgence is not appropriate. Likewise His saying Almighty: {Say not to them [so much as], \"Uff\"} (17 Al-Isra: 23). Nothing is understood from the wording except the prevention of \"Uff\" only. As for killing, beating, and others, there is no prevention from them in this wording at all, because all that is not named \"Uff\" nor expressed by \"Uff\". If a human killed another, and a reporter reported about him and a witness testified that he said \"Uff\" to him, he would be a liar, a false witness, and a committer of a major sin—by the judgment of the Chosen One for mediation between us and the First One, peace be upon him, mighty is his Sender and majestic—since he judged that false testimony is among the major sins. Whoever is not deterred by the ugliness of exiting intellects, let him be deterred by the fear of severe punishment on the Day of Recompense; we seek refuge in God from that. If a swearer swore against the killer that he said \"Uff\" to the killed, his oath would be a false oath (Ghamus). So how did one describing himself with understanding permit judging a judgment by which he admits against himself that he is a liar if he verifies the judgment? By my life, many of them are virtuous, understanding, righteous, honored by their merit, but deficiency has not spared any human except those protected by Divine powers among the Prophets, peace be upon them [69v] specifically. The slip of the scholar is very harmful; if it did not infect others, its harm would be less. But when God Almighty said {And to parents, good treatment (Ihsan)}, this wording necessitated...",

Goodness is obligatory, so Badness is forbidden. Because your saying 'Do good to So-and-so' stands in place of your saying 'Do not do bad to him'; that is a meaning necessitated by it only. But your saying 'Do not do bad to him' does not contain 'Do good to him'. Likewise if you said 'Do not do good to him', there is not in it that you do bad to him at all, because this is of the Opposites having intermediates. The intermediate here is what is between Badness and Goodness: Leaving alone (Mutarakah). But if you said 'Do bad to So-and-so', in it is the removal of Goodness from him, because the Opposite repels the Opposite; if one occurs, the other is invalid. Ponder these meanings; you will be illuminated in all your requests by the light your Creator Almighty granted you, by which He brought your resemblance close to Angels and separated you from Beasts. Otherwise, you would be like one stumbling in the dark, confused, not knowing what you undertake in reality, nor leaving by certainty but by sensing and rushing—which perhaps lead you to destruction and cast you into perils. May God guide us and you by His grace. If you reach this chapter, stop at it and cast your thought to what we spoke to you about just now regarding Equivalents (Mutala'imat) which we expressed with expressions. Perhaps [some] of the heedless—whose righteousness is desired more than they desire righteousness for themselves—will say upon looking into it: 'This author has troubled himself with something everyone equals him in knowing'. Let him know that we only view meanings with agreed-upon words to be decisive over what is obscure to understand of what is not of their type. Here the merit of our speech just now on Equivalents appears to you, and you find great relief in understanding it. Since we presented at the beginning of our book that there is no way to know the realities of things except by the mediation of the Word, there is no way to transfer the mandate of Reason from its place regarding the existence of things on their ranks which their Originator, Glorious and Mighty, arranged them upon. Nor is there a way to transfer the requirement of the Word from its place arranged for expression. Otherwise, you have committed Falsehood and left Truth. All evidences invalidate transferring the Word from its place in the language, and no proof validates it at all. If a speaker says: 'We have found a transferred word', it is said to him: That which you found, it has become clear to us that it is its placement in that place, and we did not find that in what we want to attach to it without proof. Not every named thing you found transferred from its rank by a proof necessitates that you transfer [another] to other than it by your opinion without proof.

So judge every command as abrogated because you found many abrogated matters! And you found also in people's speech many lies; this is invalidating truths, so turn away from it as is appropriate. By God Almighty is success. 12 - Chapter on Divisions of Knowledge (Ma'arif), which are Sciences: Know that the knowledge of every knower among us regarding what he knows—which is his knowing of what he knows—is divided into two parts: One is Primary and the second is Secondary (Consequent). The Primary is divided into two parts: One is what the human knows by his instinct (Fitrah) and the mandate of his creation favored with Speech (Reason), which is discrimination, disposal, and distinguishing between witnessed things. He knew this chapter by his primary reason, like knowing that the Whole is more than the Part; that whoever was not born before you is not older than you; that whoever did not precede is not before; that the two halves of a number are equal to its whole; that the existence of a single body in two different places at one time is impossible; that everything truthful in its negation, its affirmation is lie—[and everything false] in its negation, its affirmation is truth; that Truth is not in a thing and its opposite; and that all parts extracted by Reason in their totality completely, a correct extraction, where one of them is inevitable—if all are false except one, that one is true by necessity. The second part of this First Division is what the human knew by his Sense leading to certainty by the mediation of Reason. Like knowing that fire is hot, snow is cold, aloe is bitter, dates are sweet, new snow is white, tar is black, hedgehog (1) skin is rough, silk is soft, the sound of thunder is stronger than the sound of a chicken, and the like. This—no one knows how the validity of knowledge of it occurred to him, nor was there any time at all between the first times of his understanding and discrimination and his self's habituation to mentioning it, and his knowing the validity of what we mentioned. Neither long nor short, neither little nor much, nor delay. Rather, it is the action of God Almighty in the soul. It is compelled to do that by necessity and finds no deviation from it at all.

If a human tried to make a human imagine contrary to what we mentioned, he would not be able. If he is able to do that one day, it is known that there is a severe [defect] in his mind; it is not permissible otherwise. Into the second part of these two divisions enters the validity of knowledge of what Transmission (Naql/Tradition) validated for the informed person, a necessary realization. Like our knowing that the elephant exists though we have not seen it [70v]; that Egypt and Mecca are in the world; that Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them, existed; that Aristotle and Galen existed; and like the Battle of Siffin and the Camel; and the people of Constantinople being kings of the Romans and Christians, and Christianity being their dominant religion among them; and like news appearing to us every day regarding which a person finds no way to doubt at all. Likewise [that] in the human head is a brain, in his belly are intestines, in his chest a heart, and in his veins blood. Reference in that is made to the saying of anatomists and the saying of those who saw the heads of the killed cracked open and their insides brought out. That became valid also with a necessary validity. These two divisions, it is not permissible to seek proof for their validity, nor does anyone task another with that except one lacking reason and abundant in ignorance, or resembling them—they are few in number. Rather, from these two divisions all evidences stand. All demonstrations return—even if their end is far—as we presented to you, from conclusions taken from premises, and so on forever, even if conjunctions and conclusions multiply and their types differ, until you stop returning at these two knowledges gifted from the First One, and by His bounty and the overflowing of His favor upon us without merit from us for that. Since no action preceded from us necessitating He gives us this great gift by which He created for us the way to relation with Angels who are the best creation He created, and whom He overflowed with a complete overflowing, purifying them from every deficiency or defect (1). By these ways we mentioned, we knew that we have a One, First, True Creator who never ceased to be, and that what is other than Him is originated, many, created, was not then was. By them we knew the truthfulness of the Messengers calling to Him Almighty, the Mission of Muhammad, peace be upon him, and upon all Prophets, Messengers, and Angels.

That produces for him the denial of Lordship, Tawhid, Prophethood, and Laws. Either he enters into that, or contradicts himself the contradiction of a madman with his tongue; we seek refuge in God from abandonment. According to the closeness of these conclusions to these Primary Knowledges, their clarification is easy; and according to their distance, their stability is distant. Except that whatever is valid from these ways, closely or distantly, is equal in being Truth, an equality; even if some is more obscure. It is not permissible that a Truth be 'more true' than another Truth, nor a Falsehood 'more false' than another Falsehood. Since if it existed, it is established and existed. What is invalid, and what exited from the certainty of existence and stability and did not enter [71r] into the certainty of invalidity, is doubted by the doubter. In its essence, it is still either Truth or Falsehood; it is not permissible otherwise. Ignorance of the one ignorant of it or doubt of the doubter in it does not invalidate it if it is Truth; nor does the error of one imagining it or doubting it make the Falsehood true. This is the summary of speech on the First Division. As for the Second, it is what I mentioned to you just now that is known by premises producing [conclusions] upon the attributes we defined, that they return to Reason and Sense either closely or distantly. Into this division enters the description of knowledge of Tawhid, Lordship, Eternality, Invention, Prophethood, and what Laws, Rulings, and Worships brought, as we presented in our other books. Because if Tawhid is valid, Prophethood is valid, the obligation of obeying it is valid, and commands and prohibitions from the Prophet, peace be upon him, are valid, then believing their validity and obeying them becomes obligatory. Into this division also enters speech on Physics, Canons of Medicine, modes of treatment and temperament, and most ranks of Number and Geometry. Know that nothing is known at all in any way without these two paths. Whoever does not arrive from them is claiming knowledge and is not a scholar, even if his belief agrees with the Truth. But he is lucky here. We have found people of determination do not praise safety by risk. Waiting for finding a lost item and abandoning seeking is a blameworthy, rejected, very base character. In this, the Imitator (Muqallid) has a strong resemblance and correct relation to one whose craft is this. Rather, the Imitator is in a worse state because his waste is uglier and more dire in consequence, unless the Sharia necessitates that he be called a scholar and that be known by demonstration, so one stops at what the...",

However, there is a way here you should use in debate specifically by way of restraining the rioting of the ignorant opponent—not by which a saying becomes valid nor binds anyone in reality nor establishes a demonstration. It is that a group has become accustomed to a bad habit, so the virtue of discrimination is corrupted in them entirely. That is, they do not pay attention to Demonstration even if they acknowledge it is Demonstration. They have become accustomed to Persuasion and corrupt Rioting such that they are restrained if opposed by it. These, if you oppose them [with proof], it does not affect them, and perhaps they harm you with their tongues. But if you oppose them with Persuasion, they become humiliated with the humiliation of an orphan, spare you their evil, and their disgrace and rage intensify; perhaps that affects some of them. The matter of this sect, despite their multitude among people, reminded me of what some ancient physicians said: 'The one of severe nature whom strong medicines do not anesthetize [71v], a tablet of violet anesthetizes him.' Example of that are groups you see: if you support the correct opinion with correct premises stated in the Quran and Hadith which they acknowledge as authentic, that does not affect them at all. Likewise if you stood them upon it by sense and reason. Until if you said to them 'So-and-so says this saying' and mentioned a man of the common people marked with good, they submit to him, pause greatly, and their side becomes easy. Especially if you mentioned to them a group saying that, you are spared the trouble with them. These should be deterred by what affects them. The skilled physician does not give medicine except according to the endurance of the patient's constitution. Treating souls is more worthy of gentleness for their reformation than treating bodies. As for seeking the presentation of premises: either it is sought in its proper way which he placed, so the seeker is on certainty and confidence; or he and his opponent agree on premises not established by the work we presented but by mutual consent. This is divided into two parts: One is that the premises happen to be [on] truth, so they enter into the section we presented by their luck not their search, by their fortune not their effort, and by their lot not their inspection. The second is that they agree on a corrupt premise or two premises. This is divided into two parts: One is that they mutually consent to that, being unjust to themselves. What those calamities they smeared themselves with produced is binding on them in the laws of debate, not in reality. The reality remains as it is; the mutual consent of the ignorant to falsehood does not harm it. That is very frequent in sects, natural opinions, and creeds; like the agreement of Manichaeans on the eternality of the two principles, Christians on the Trinity, and a group of...",

The second part is that the verifying scholar opponent agrees with his opponent on a corrupt premise, presenting it not satisfied with it, but to show him the corruption of its production and that it leads him to an impossible, inherent corruption. Know that this judgment should bind the one satisfied with it to commit to it. It does not bind the one tolerant in it on the condition of clarifying its corruption. What bound Adurbadh bin Mara was like what refuted the Mobadh Mani bin Hammani in his own saying before it, which is contrary to what Mani verified first. Often in Sharia we bind the arbitrary proponents of Analogy (Qiyas) with things from their premises that return to contradiction or to what binds them, so the corruption of [72r] their doctrine appears. Like what a great one [of] our predecessors (1)—we love him for his virtue but the Truth is more beloved to us than him and better—presented. He said: 'Whoever reaches puberty, male or female, and does not know God at the beginning of his puberty with all His attributes by knowledge of inference, speculation, and research, is a disbeliever whose blood is lawful.' We swear by God our Creator an oath in which we make no exception that the Chief produced this judgment against himself to be a disbeliever whose blood and wealth are lawful. We repeat the oath by God Almighty a second time that he did not enter his grave except ignorant of the complete validity of what he narrowed after his knowledge this narrowing, even though he exceeded eighty-five (2) years of age. May God have mercy on us and him and forgive us and him. Were it not that this premise of his is corrupt, what is obligatory on one defined by his definition and described by his description would be obligatory on him. But it is, praise be to God, a false proposition, so what it produced is not obligatory on him nor on others. We mentioned this chapter in the Fifth Type of Demonstration. Know that whoever agreed with us in these Primaries then denied their requirements, or opposed us in the Primaries and did not affirm them, we left him. If we spoke to him, we would be like one speaking to a drunkard, except in two cases: One is that fear compels [us] to speak with him if we leave speaking with him. The second is hope for his return, or the return of another present or absent whom our speech reaches or our speech establishes [proof against?].

For the First, One, Creator, Creator of Truth and Commander of it in His covenants to us said: {Be maintainers of justice, witnesses for God} (4 An-Nisa: 135). And Almighty said: {Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best} (16 An-Nahl: 125). His Messenger, the intermediary between us and Him Almighty, peace be upon him, said to us in his commandments to us: \"That God guides by your guidance one man is better for you than red camels.\" Until if our fear or hope rises, it becomes obligatory on us then to do what the One, First, Mighty and Majestic commanded us in His covenants to us: {Upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided} (5 Al-Ma'idah: 105). So we say to the one of this sect whom we are obliged to speak to—and by my life they are many as the One First Almighty described when informing us about those who wandered in falsehoods: {Say, \"Shall we [not] inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds? [They are] those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while they think that they are doing well in work.\"} (18 Al-Kahf: 103-104). And Almighty said: {Do they have eyes by which they see? Or do they have ears by which they hear?} (7 Al-A'raf: 195). We say to one whose description is this: If you deny truths [72v] and what Sense and Reason witnessed and delivered to the Soul, do not be ashamed of the ugliness of this description. Leave the fatigue in eating food and striving for it, and wait as you are. Go out individually to the enemy's camps from the edges of the frontiers and the desolate wildernesses, trailing your robes. Remain there reassured, visible, until you see the truth of what we tell you becoming clear to the Soul that it befalls you. Throw yourselves on the crowns of your heads from the top of the minaret. Throw knives and stones at your flesh, then cut with them. If they refrain from all this, they have verified the Primaries indicating the consequences of matters. If they persist, we turn away from them to what is more useful for us and worthier for us, by which we hope to draw near to our Creator on the Day of our gathering for Judgment in the World of Recompense. We ask Him humbly to favor us and establish us in the number of the righteous rational ones in this abode, and to enter us into the number of the winners there. We seek refuge in Him from the opposite of what we asked, Amen. More complete in stupidity and more impudent in face than those we mentioned are the claimants of Inspiration (Ilham). The thick-faced is not incapable of claiming that he was inspired with the invalidity of their saying without proof. Such people are pitied for their departure from the Truth. By God Almighty we seek help. A group rioted saying: By what thing were these matters which became valid by Reason established for you?",

We have said that the validity of that is established by necessity in the Soul without proof for the validity of that at all. What we opposed them with suffices us if they are fair to themselves; otherwise, we have no speech with one who admitted that he is not correct and has no reason. 13 - Mention of Things that are Confused for a Group in the Way of Demonstration: Know that a group estimated that Demonstration stands from what we mentioned in the Chapter of Relation regarding one of the two things necessitating the other. They did not differentiate between the Necessary of that and other than it. We differentiate, God Almighty willing, between the correct of that and the corrupt. We say, and by God Almighty is success and we are supported: This thing is called by the predecessors \"Circular Argument\" (Burhan al-Dawr). Example of that: A speaker says: 'The proof that the existence of moderation in matters exists is that excess exists.' It is said to him: 'And what is the proof that excess exists?' He says: 'Since moderation exists, it is necessary that excess exists.' From this speech arose: 'When excess existed, excess existed.' This is invalid, corrupt in rank, which is to cite the thing as witness for itself. The correct way [73r] is to cite the Certain as witness for the Unknown. If the thing is Unknown, it is not Certain for the one to whom it is unknown. You desire that it be clarified here by itself, which is that Unknown itself. If the thing is Certain, the Certain does not need a demonstration. This is a corrupt inference as you see. Every thing is either Known or Unknown. The Known validates others among Unknowns, and the Unknown is validated by others among Knowns. The existence of each of the two Related things necessitating the existence of its companion is a matter known by primary reason, so seeking inference for it is an error. As for the error in explaining the Unknown, it is like a human saying to a human: 'What is the description of the Elephant?' He says to him: 'The description of the Buffalo (Khanzir - Pig/Buffalo context dependent but likely logic example).' The questioner does not know the description of the Buffalo. He says to him: 'And what is the description of the Buffalo?' He says to him: 'The description of the Elephant.' This is severe corruption, returning to 'The description of the Elephant is the description of the Elephant.' Into this enters the confusion of one who desires to establish Analogy by Analogy or Report by Report and the like. As for a thing being used as evidence for its own invalidity, that is not permissible either except from one aspect: that it leads to corruption or contradiction, so it invalidates it then.

We presented that the validity of the mandate of Reason has no known cause other than its stability in the Soul by necessity, with no deviation from it. Reason is not established by Reason, but by the Necessity that met the Discrimination which nothing precedes (1) at all. Into Inference may also enter a thing called \"Inference by the Effect (Ma'lum) to the Cause ('Illah),\" like one who wants to establish Demonstration for the existence of Fire by Smoke which is generated from Fire and its action. The Cause is more apparent in minds than the Effect. However, if the questioner is ignorant of the Cause being a cause, and is knowledgeable that the Effect is generated from the Cause, it is obligatory then to verify for him that this thing is a cause for this other by deducing the Effect by it and its being existing by its existence. If a man saw smoke from a distance and said: 'In that place is fire inevitably because I see smoke has risen there', he would be inferring by the reality of Inference. This one did not infer that the totality of Fire exists because of the Smoke, but knew that the Effect does not exist unless its Cause exists. When he saw the Smoke, which is the Effect, he knew that the Cause is there, which is the Fire.

So a group decides, because of what we mentioned, that all individuals of that species—even if absent from them—contain that attribute; and that everything in which that attribute exists among things is judged by that judgment. By my life, if we were able to exhaust those individuals from first to last until we encompass with knowledge that not one of them deviated from us, and we found this attribute general to all of them, it would be obligatory that we require by its generality for them. Likewise, if we found the rulings stipulated for everything containing that attribute, we would decide that it is adhering to everything containing that attribute. But since we are not able to exhaust that, nor do we find it in the Judgment stipulated for everything containing that attribute, this is divination from the one judging arbitrarily by it, fabrication, looseness in lying, judging without knowledge, and deception of people and of himself first—whose advice (1) is more obligatory upon him. We exemplify that with a visual example. We say, and by God is success: The description of the Described by the Attribute is divided into two parts: One is an attribute inevitable for the Described by necessity, like our certain knowledge that every possessor of spirit is breathing, and every breather possesses an instrument by which he breathes—either by taking air or expelling it, or grasping by it and expelling it if he is among water dwellers. This is a division established in Reason, known by necessity, with no deviation from it. If the Soul lacked the Instrument, it would separate from the Body. The second part may be found adhering to the Described by it, but if it were absent it would not harm it, like the Gall Bladder. If you opened most types of animals, you would find it in them, except the Camel, for it has no Gall Bladder. A group mentioned that the Horse has no [74r] Spleen. And like the common knowledge among people that we have not witnessed a female mule nor a male mule (2) being born. And like our never finding a ram of sheep with a beard. An informant informed me in the gathering of some chiefs that he witnessed a female mule giving birth in a land, and a group who were in that region testified to the validity of that for him. One whom I trust informed me that he saw rams with beards and he-goats without beards. I saw a small cat give birth to two distinct, separate, complete bodies, no organ missing from them at all; in each body a tail, two hands, and two legs, gathered by one head having no eyes, two ears, and one mouth. I also saw a chick and a gosling; the two eggs hatched them, and each of them had four legs; a group who were with me were shown the chick.

As for those opposing us in creed while agreeing with us in religion, they tracked Doers (Agents) and did not find a choosing Doer at all except a Body. So they decided that the First Doer, Mighty and Majestic, is a Body because they did not witness a Doer except a Body. Guard against such rioting; many people's error was great in it. I have shown you the path by which they were deceived, so avoid it. It is the saying [asserted] despite the establishment of Demonstration on its invalidity and despite it being a mere claim. In all that, they were contradicted in it. That is because if they [do not] mislead themselves and deceive them, and track what they found a correct tracking, they would not find a choosing doer other than originated and other than composed—either from birth or from transforming moistures. God is exalted above what the wrongdoers say with great highness. They have contradicted and invalidated their proof. Let them know that they are in a heinous trial. They acknowledge without disagreement among them that whoever believes this is separating from the religion, his blood is lawful, disavowing his Creator. It binds them—if their judgment is correct since they never witnessed a choosing doer except composed from birth or transforming moistures—to decide regarding the First One Almighty that He is originated, composed; otherwise they have contradicted. Is not one with the slightest understanding and reason ashamed to testify against himself that he is firm on a false thing? As for what those agreeing with us in creed among our companions the Traditionists (Akhbaris) erred in, they tracked every Described thing in the world and saw it only deserved that name by an attribute in it from which [74v] that name was derived for it. So they decided because of that that the First One, Mighty and Majestic, is Possessor of Hearing, Sight, Life, and Will, and that He is speaking not silent; that He Almighty is described as Hearing, Seeing, Living, Willing, having Speech. Had they been fair to themselves and not rushed into what they reproach their opponents with, they would have—if they inspected this inspection—found with certainty that they never see nor witness a Described with a thing except that attribute is an Accident carried in the Described, and that the Attribute is only carried by a Substance. Although what we mention, no thinker in the world imagines a rank other than it. It binds them—since they never witnessed a Described with an attribute except it is a Substance carrying an Accident in its essence—to say: The First, like Whom there is nothing, is a Substance carrying Accidents and never separating from them. God is exalted above that with great highness. But they recoiled from this error and fled from it.

And not to rest on Induction (Istiqra') at all unless he encompasses with knowledge all Particulars under the Whole in which he judges. If he cannot, he should not decide in judgment on what he did not witness, and should not judge except on what he perceived, not what was not perceived. This, if you ponder it in Sharia rulings, benefits you greatly and prevents you from Analogy (Qiyas) which deceived many people and virtuous Imams by whose error thousands of thousands of people erred. If you do that, you are on certainty of correctness because you did not decide with Analysis (Halal) nor Prohibition (Haram) nor Obligation except on what the ruling from God Almighty came to you about. As for what you did not find a text in, withhold from it and do not decide on it, for it is [not] included in the ruling of what you found a text in; so withhold from it. Know that a group erred in this type an error by which they did not exit from this affiliation, except that by poor insight they thought themselves out of it, so they named their action in this chapter by another name: they called it \"Inference by the Witnessed (Present) upon the Absent.\" In reality, had they achieved the search, they would have known that the Absent from the senses among known things is not absent from the Intellect; rather, it is witnessed in it like the witnessing of what is perceived by senses, with no difference. If a man is certain that senses are conveyors to the Soul, and that the Soul only [75r] validates its judgment by sensed things if its reason is healthy from defects, and by emptying itself of all that occupies its reason, and isolating itself to clarify by it and think in what guided it to it—the man would not find then for what is witnessed by his senses a superiority over what he witnessed by his intellect without his senses. There is no Absent among known things at all such that if it is absent from the Intellect, it is not permissible to be known at all. We find the blind man born blind certain that colors exist, like the certainty of the sighted, with no difference. Likewise, our certainty of the existence of the elephant even if we never saw it is like the certainty of one who saw it, with no difference. The blind and sighted only differed in the Quality (How-ness) of colors only. As for Color being correct existing, there is no difference between them in the certainty of knowledge of that.

It is not that our finding many things sharing some of their attributes a correct sharing, then our finding some of those things isolated by a ruling we are certain of from them, necessitates that we judge on the rest of those things with equality in this second ruling because of their equality (1) in the first ruling. This claim is ugly and foul arbitrariness. This is only binding if a nature necessitates that a thing exists in what it is in, and we know the necessity of that by our intellects. If that is so, we judge by necessity on what we did not witness of the parts of that thing by our judgment on what we witnessed of them. Like the nature of the measurement of every moving body necessitating it to be finite in diameters; this is known by the priority of Reason and the requirement of the judgment of Quantity. And like the nature of human beings necessitating that a mule is not born from him nor does he become pregnant, but [is born] a body (2) of a certain shape, having a rational soul accepting education, disposal, and craft. Our knowledge that our bodies are finite because the nature of Reason necessitates that is not stronger than our knowledge that the body of the Sphere is finite. It did not become valid for us because our bodies are finite; but the mode by which it was correct that our bodies are finite, by it it was correct that the body of the Sphere is finite. Likewise also our knowledge that every soft thing meeting a solid thing with a strong meeting clashes, the solid influences the soft by necessity—either by separating its parts or transforming it from its shape—not because we witnessed that in counted bodies, but the nature of Reason necessitates that [75v].

God Almighty cursed disobedient, transgressing people; do you think He curses every human because they are like those cursed ones in being humans and disobedient transgressors? He burned a people because they cheated the measure, and burned with them their children and women; do you think every cheater of measure and balance is burned, he and his child and wife? Indeed, this is the far error. Among the wondrous things occurring to those deceived by this corrupt type is that if they like to change their mind in this judgment they judged, leaving it is not difficult for them. They extract things from the similar ones from a judgment found in some of them and say: 'This exited its principle and became anomalous (Shadhdh), and the Anomalous is not analogized upon.' We say: If this anomalous judgment were a principle for the anomaly, what deviated from it would not have deviated. It is not permissible for a branch to spring from other than its root. If that were so, the Root would not be a root for what is rooted in it, nor would the rooted be rooted from it. Do not think that what contradicted the form of its species gathering it is anomalous to its species and root, for you would err. Because if you knew that it does not deviate from its root at all, and that those additions are only from an increase in the matter of the element over the amount from which the complete individual stands—likewise the decrease also is a decrease from the matter of the element. Thus are the correct roots (principles). Like this is what Grammarians use in their causes ('ilal); they are all corrupt, nothing of them returns to reality at all. The truth of that is only that this was heard from the people of language to whom return is made in recording and transmitting it. What exceeds this is, along with being [76r] corrupt contradictory arbitrariness, also a lie. Because their saying 'The origin was such, then it was deemed heavy so it was transferred to such' is a thing every person of sense knows is a lie that never was, nor were the Arabs upon it for a period then transferred to what was heard from them after that. The First Creator said a saying that sufficed everyone of toil when He said Almighty: {Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"} (2 Al-Baqarah: 111). Then He added clarification saying Almighty: {And if they testify, do not testify with them} (6 Al-An'am: 150). Then He added clarification saying Almighty: {He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned} (21 Al-Anbiya: 23).

Some of them named this chapter: \"Applying the Cause to the Effect.\" By my life, if it were correct that that is a cause—like killing being a cause for death, hunger a cause for wanting food, thirst a cause for wanting fresh water—it would be obligatory to apply it to its effects. Even so, there is no way that a Cause exists ever in time except its Effect exists. But if it is not so, know that it is not a Cause. As for what an arbitrary person claimed is a Cause without proof, it is not obligatory to apply it to what is not an effect of it. In general, there is no Cause in Sharias (Laws) at all in any way, nor anything necessitating them except the Commands coming from God Almighty only. Since there is nothing in Reason necessitating prohibiting anything in the world and permitting another, nor obligating an action and leaving the obligation of another. Commands are causes necessitating what they brought. If they do not come, there is no cause necessitating anything at all nor preventing it. Since the Cause is only that which is never found except its effect is with it, this is only in Natural things. Since this is so, it is not permissible to raise the name of Cause to other than this meaning, causing confusion by applying one name to two different meanings. This is the strongest path for people of jugglery. Know and be alert to what I am presenting to you, God Almighty willing: That this thing which they named 'Inference by the Witnessed upon the Absent' and 'Applying the Cause to the Effect' is only valid for invalidating the Equal in Judgment, not affirming it.

Therefore, we are then not decisive that what is absent from our senses among those absent things equaling these present ones in the attribute in which all these present ones equaled—that it agrees with the judgment of these [76v] present ones nor that it disagrees. This is what our opponents do not disagree with us on, because it is necessary. So it is established that the benefit is great and correct by the difference of Witnessed things in invalidating the decisiveness of the equality of Absent things from senses with them. And that we do not benefit by the equality of Witnessed things—in what the nature of Reason did not necessitate for them—in knowing the judgment of Absent things. Do you not see that if we do not find a donkey ruminating, we do not decide that it does not exist; rather, if found, we would not deny it. Indeed...",

    "text": "...[an informant] informed me that he has the existence of a horse that ruminates. And no possessor of a horn was ever found except with a cloven hoof, except the Indian Rhinoceros (wild donkey?), for it is possessor of a horn without a cloven hoof. Such matters which Nature does not necessitate are in the limit of Possible, except that according to the scarcity or abundance of their existence, they enter the Far Possible or the Close Equal. We find luminous, red, hot things. Whoever says Light is the cause of burning, we showed him luminous things like mirrors and others which are not burning. Whoever says Redness is the cause of burning, we showed him blood, not burning. Whoever says Heat is the cause of burning, we showed him things that heat the body but do not burn. It became necessary by necessity that nothing of what we mentioned is a cause, while they are consistent attributes as you see. But every simple element, hot, dry, ascending, luminous, elevating moistures, descending by force, transforming into air, is burning without doubt, because the nature of Reason necessitates that. Whoever follows the path we forbade is not safe from confusion, contradiction, or arbitrariness without proof. What this corrupt inference also led a group to is that they said: 'Since we are living rational beings, and the Stars are higher than us and in a purer place, their influence was apparent in us, and they were more worthy of life and speech than us; so they are living rational wise beings.' It binds them by this corrupt demonstration that since they found every wise distinguishing rational living being among us is only flesh and blood possessing brain and heart—no other way is permissible, nor did they ever witness a living being except thus—they must decide that Stars and Angels are composed of flesh and blood and possessors of brains and hearts because they are living rational beings. All this is error, because it is not because of our nobility over stones and that we influence them that Speech and Life became necessary for us. Nor is it because we are rational living beings that we must be flesh and blood. But since we were distinguishing, knowing, sensing, [77r] the name of Speech and Life became necessary for us as an expression of that state of ours and a naming for it. Some of them also deceived, saying to prove the residence of the Soul in the Brain: 'The King always resides in the high citadels; the Soul is the King of the body, and the Brain is the highest of the body; so the Soul is in it.' How many kings we saw residing only in the lowlands of their province, leaving the citadels! A confused one like him opposed him, saying to prove it is in the Heart: 'The King always resides in the center of his province; the Heart is the center of the body; [so] it is necessary that the Soul be in it.' How many kings resided at the edge of their province or near their province and left the center! All this is weak arbitrariness. Like one who said: 'I found the dog long-tailed, so it is fit also for guarding sheep.'...",

    "text": "...and the predator has a long tail, so it is also fit for guarding livestock. This occurs very frequently, and what we mentioned is sufficient. Many people have used things like this; they forbade and permitted based on it and judged arbitrarily in God Almighty's religion. That is like their judgment that 'measuring' is the cause (Illah) of prohibition in Usury (Riba), and the arbitrariness of others that 'storing' is the cause of prohibition in Riba, and others said: 'eating' (1) is the cause of prohibition in Riba. Is this [anything] but exactly like what we mentioned before? Likewise, if we find an attribute in a described object, and that described object has a certain judgment, and if that attribute is removed, that judgment is removed—it is not necessary just because of this that whenever that attribute is found in a described object, that judgment is found for it. Rather, perhaps that attribute may be found for it, but that judgment is not found for it. An example of that: If life was never existing in a certain body, it is necessary by necessity that that body is not a human, without doubt. If a man wanted to proceed on the path I criticized, he would have to say: 'So if life is found in a body, it must be a human,' and this is a pure lie. An example of that in Sharia: If your ownership is removed from a thing, its ownership has passed to another, or it is correct that no creature has ownership over it—which is more rightful. So [they argue] if another's ownership is removed from it, does it compel that its ownership becomes valid for you, or that no creature has ownership over it? Rather, perhaps a third party other than both of you owns it. Know that looseness (tolerance) in seeking truths is not permissible at all. It is only Truth or Falsehood. It is not permissible for a thing to be 'true falsehood', nor 'false truth', nor 'false not-true'. If these two divisions are invalid by primary reason necessarily, the third division is established since no division remains other than it, which is: either Truth or Falsehood. Therefore, the First One, Mighty and Majestic, said to us in His covenants to us: {So what is [77v] there after the truth except error?} (10 Yunus: 32). Perhaps an ignorant person objects to us regarding two things, saying: 'You speak of the permissibility of things like singing and other than that; is it truth or falsehood?' The answer, and by God Almighty is success: Everything we permitted, if the doer does it to recreate himself and aid his health and energy to be strong enough to execute the commands of his Creator, Mighty and Majestic, then all of this is Truth. If he does it out of vanity and insolence, then all of that is Error. However, some error is idle talk (Laghw) not counted against us out of kindness to us, and some is counted...",

The Chosen One sent from the First One, peace be upon him, said to us: \"Actions are only by intentions, and for every man is what he intended.\" The second thing is that the critic says: 'You said there is nothing but Truth or Falsehood. Truth is demonstrative: either primary, or produced from primary, or nearby, or distant; and whatever is other than these two ways is Falsehood. Yet you judge by the Single Report (Khabar al-Wahid) in rulings and by the testimony of two witnesses, and you acknowledge that your judgment in that might be false.' The answer, and by God Almighty is success: Judging by the Single Report in rulings and by the testimony of two witnesses is a necessary demonstrative Truth; we decide upon its Unseen [validity as a command]. As for the particulars of that—meaning the testimony—we do not know whether it agrees with what we are certain is Truth [reality] or not; this is due to our falling short of knowing the Unseen. However, we verify without doubt that every proposition of it is either Truth or Falsehood in its essence; it must be so. We did not claim that every [judgment of ours] is Truth or Falsehood [in factual reality]; rather, the judgment in many matters is hidden from us, while they are in their essences either Truth or Falsehood. Among the strange things in which our brothers—who agree with us in friendship and creed but oppose us in Fatwa—erred is that two rulings appeared regarding Barley and Dates; they transferred one of them to Olives and Figs, and prevented transferring the other to Olives and Figs. That is: Prohibition came regarding Barley for Barley and Dates for Dates in sale except like for like, measure for measure, hand to hand; and we were commanded to give Barley or Dates in Zakat al-Fitr. They said—the saying of one who judges arbitrarily—: 'As for the prohibition in sale except like for like and hand to hand, it is transferred to Olives and Figs; as for giving in Zakat, it is not transferred to Olives and Figs.' They have thousands of propositions like this and more heinous, which we will explain in our books on the rulings of religion, God willing. Arbitrariness with the tongue is not impossible for one who accepts it for himself [78r], and Falsehood is abundant. As for that which we praise the Giver, the Benefactor, Mighty and Majestic, for its people having it, it is the Truth. That which the achiever should rejoice in is what Demonstration necessitated. Know that there is no difference between what validates Legal (Sharia) Rulings and what validates Natural Propositions in the ranks of Demonstration we presented. Rather, error in Sharia is more harmful and of more corrupting nature in the World, and of worse consequence in the Hereafter, and more deserving of being looked into and managed for correction, and worthier of abandoning looseness, and more fortunate in seeking correctness. One should not proceed in it except upon what existing premises necessitated from their likes until reaching the primaries of Reason and Sense. By God...",

Error in that is encompassed by Falsehood, and that group is singled out for punishment in the Abode of the Hereafter for he who was stubborn and abandoned research while capable of it. Know that the predecessors named the Premises \"Qiyas\" (Syllogism). Our brothers, the proponents of Qiyas (Analogy), devised a weak, sophistical trick: they applied the name Qiyas to Arbitrariness and Sophistry. They named their arbitrariness via blameworthy Induction (Istiqra') \"Qiyas\". And they named their judgment—in what no text appeared—by the judgment of another thing in which a text appeared due to their resemblance in some of their attributes, \"Qiyas\", \"Inference\" (Istidlal), and \"Applying the Cause to the Effect\". They wanted to correct the Falsehood by naming it with a name others applied to the Clear Truth. Like what reached us about some ignorant Berbers who wanted to legitimize eating a piglet he hunted by naming it \"Child of the Deer\". It has come from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he warned of a people who legitimize wine by calling it by other than its name. This is a camouflaged trick that does not stand upon clarification. We said before that there are no two things in the world except that there is some resemblance and difference between them by necessity; it must be so. If resemblance necessitates equality of judgment, let us judge everything in the world with one judgment because of its resemblance in some attribute. Why did gathering in resemblance necessitate equality of judgment, while separation in resemblance did not necessitate difference of judgment? According to this, we must not judge two things at all with one judgment because of their difference in some attribute. All of this is error and confusion, leading to contradiction and misguidance. We seek refuge in God from all that, and there is no power or strength except in God. 15 - Chapter on Additional Discourse in Explaining Sophistry: The Ancients named what is taken from corrupt premises \"Sophistry\" (Safsata). We will explain sufficient modes of it by the power of God, the Giver of knowledge and His strength; there is no god but He. Know that the Rioter supporting Falsehood, his greatest weapon is Obfuscation (Talbis). That is either by affirming what is not necessary; or by dropping a division of the divisions or more than one division; or adding a corrupt division [78v]; or by bringing divisions that are all corrupt; or by clinging to a Homonymous word agreed upon in its validity which gives many things of different rulings and attributes, while agreeing also in things; so he wants to...",

Affirming what is not necessary is like saying: 'If the Creator Almighty were other than a body, He would be an accident; since it is established that the Creator Almighty is not an accident, it is correct that He is a body.' This one suspended His Almighty being non-body on His being an accident, and this is not necessary. Had he suspended that on what necessitates his proposition, he would have been truthful; that is if he said: 'If the Creator Almighty were originated and was other than a body, He would be an accident.' This is a correct presentation, but the Creator Almighty is not originated, so He is neither a body nor an accident. We are now only in the clarification of the validity of the work of Conjunctions, not in the clarification of particulars, for that has its place. As for dropping a division, it is like the speaker saying: 'This color is not devoid of being red, green, yellow, or black,' after dropping white, azure, and others. As for adding a corrupt division, it is like the speaker saying: 'This thing is not devoid of being this thing, or being other than it, or neither it nor other than it.' This is a corrupt additional division. As for coming with divisions that are all corrupt, it is like the speaker saying: 'The Creator Almighty is not devoid of having done things to repel harm, or to attract benefit, or for a nature, or for a defect, or for His generosity and nobility.' These are all corrupt divisions. The correct view is that He did them not for a cause nor for a reason at all. Whoever claims against his opponent that he came with something of these modes, he must explain that. As for the Error occurring in the resemblance of Names (Homonymy), it is from an ignorant person and from an intentional one. As for the ignorant, he is excused. As for the intentional, he is blameworthy. The ignorant's error in that is like Adi bin Hatim when he heard the verse: {so eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct to you from the black thread} (2 Al-Baqarah: 187), he thought it referred to familiar threads. As for the intentional, it is like those to whom it was said \"Ra'ina\" (observe us) from Mura'at (observance), so they said 'Ra'ina' from Ru'unah (frivolity/stupidity). And like what some of the great ones said when asked about uttering (Lafz) the Quran; he said: 'This question is impossible, and uttering the Quran is not permissible because it is not uttered (Yulfaz).' He turned away from 'Lafz' which is speech and talk, and transgressed to that which is casting out (Qadhf), like a man spitting (Lafz) a morsel from his mouth. This and its like are vanishing juggleries. Likewise, you should guard against the resemblance of Script (Writing), especially in Arabic, for...",

One of the Caliphs wrote to his governor: 'Ahsi (Count) the effeminate men before you,' meaning counting the number. The scribe read it 'Akhsi' (Castrate), so he castrated everyone before him among them. For this reason, the seeker of truths is compelled to Grammar. Do you not see that if a reciter read: {Innama yakhsha Allaha min 'ibadihi al-'ulama'u} (It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah), and he put the nominative (u) on the Ha of Allah and the accusative (a) on the Hamza of Al-'Ulama, intending that while being knowledgeable, that would be an exit from the Creed? Likewise if he read: {Annnallaha bari'un min al-mushrikina wa rasulihi} (That Allah is disassociated from the disbelievers, and His Messenger), with a kasra (i) on the Lam of 'Rasulihi' (implying disassociation from His Messenger too). Guard against the likes of this with severe caution, as we will describe to you after this, God Almighty willing. From that are things occurring in the Conjunction (Ma'tuf) that are confusing, like what a group of scholars erred in regarding the saying of God Almighty: {And no one knows its interpretation except Allah. And those firm in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.\"} (3 Aal Imran: 7). They thought that \"Those firm in knowledge\" is conjoined to God Almighty [meaning they also know the interpretation]. It is not so; rather, it is the beginning of speech and a proposition, and a conjunction of a sentence to a sentence, for a necessary demonstration we have mentioned in its place. Among Sophistry also is validating another thing and its invalidity by the invalidity of another thing without a proof necessitating their correlation; that is very corrupt. Like the saying of one who said: 'If it were permissible for the Creator, Mighty and Majestic, to be seen, [it would be] a seeing unlike the familiar.' And like the saying of the speaker: 'Since prohibition is valid in wheat for wheat with excess, prohibition is valid in rice for rice with excess.' All this is arbitrariness and claim. No one is incapable of linking a thing to a thing with no link between them with his tongue if he permits deciding by what he desires. And like the saying of one of the blind men who said: 'If Color were visible, Reason would be visible; since Reason is invisible, it is necessary that Color is invisible.' Contemplate this; you will find it slander, ignorance, and boldness out of place, like the boldness of children against their fathers, with no difference. Therefore, we have covered what is needed of clarifying the correct Demonstration, mentioning sentences of corrupt dialectics and fallen riotous arguments, and clarifying many of them to the extent that the student distinguishes them if he sees them. We said that whatever is other than Demonstration via other than the path we presented, it is obligatory...",

By my life, we have increased clarification and repeated, because the error of our companions increased in that and became very obscene, so we needed to exaggerate in clarification. Let us limit ourselves to that, and let us start increasing on the merit of what we perceive by Reason. By God Almighty we hold fast and are supported; there is no god but He. 16 - Discourse on the Merit of the Power of Reason's Perception over Sense Perception: Know that sound senses may fall short of many of their perceived objects, may be weak regarding them, and may err. Then it does not take long for the Soul [79v] to clarify its error, its shortcoming, and what was hidden from it, and it perceives it with a complete perception in its reality. The perception of Reason in all that is one perception. In general, Reason is a power God Almighty singled out the Soul with, and He did not make a share in it for anything of the Body. The perception of the Soul via senses has a share for the Body, and the Body is murky and heavy. Its perception by Reason, if it looks with it and bodily desires or other blameworthy characters do not overcome it, is a pure, complete, unmixed perception. Among the closest things we exemplify to you regarding the murkiness of the Soul by its sharing with the Body and its purity by its isolation from it, and the lightness of the Body by the sharing of the Soul and its heaviness by its isolation from it, is what you see of the state of the sleeper; for his body then is heavier in weight (1). The porters who are hired know this; they frequently forbid him (the carried) from sleeping so that if he wakes up, his weight lightens and becomes less. You see the Soul in the state of sleep may witness a part of Prophecy through true vision, which there is no way to witness in the state of wakefulness. Thus, whenever it isolates and empties itself from the Body, it perceives the obscurities of things and the correct outcomes in opinions, such that a man in that state does not hear the speech of those with him nor see much of what is present. Then we return to what we began with. We say, and by God Almighty is success: You see a human from afar as a very small body, like a child, while you do not doubt with your Reason that he is bigger than what you see. Then it does not take long for him to approach you, and you see him at the size he is, which Reason never doubted he was. Likewise occurs to you regarding Sound. Also, if a thing is very far from the sense, its perception is nullified entirely. For if a human is five miles away from you...",

Until when he approached, you distinguished all that, recognized his eye, and heard his speech. And like a rumble you saw from afar and did not hear its sound; Reason did not doubt that it has a terrifying sound if you approached it. Reason in all we mentioned does not betray. As for the sense of the body, like a mustard seed added to a human's load; he does not feel it at all. Until if the pouring of mustard increases, it does not take long for him to be incapable of carrying it, even if poured on the back of an elephant or a sea ship. Reason teaches you that that poured mustard seed has a share of weight by necessity, except that Sense fell short of perceiving it due to the delay of Sense perception from Reason's perception, and that it only perceives what appears with a strong appearance; and many truths may be hidden from it as you see. Reason perceives, as I explained to you, the share of the mustard seed of weight, a perception with no difference between it and the perception of what appeared to the Sense of the weight of gathered quintals. Likewise Smell; an amount of a fals (small coin) of Asafoetida (Haltit) may be with you in the house and you do not smell it at all [80r]. Until if the parts of Asafoetida increase, it does not take long for the Smell to find it and be annoyed by it. Reason is certain that that fals has a part of the stench. The same is said regarding Musk. Reason teaches you that the power of scent in the little and the much is one, but the much, if it increases, what dissolves from it separates in the air and occupies a wide place. Likewise the Heaven; you do not see it moving, but Reason is certain it is moving due to what you see of the difference of the two motions of the bodies in it from East to West by the motion of the Heaven for them from West to East, and by their transfer in degrees and their motion by themselves. Likewise, the eye does not distinguish the movement of the Sun at all, until if a period passes, its movement appears to it with certainty by seeing it in the middle of the sky after seeing it in the horizon of the East. And like the growth of bodies of animals and plants; you do not distinguish its growth even though it is before you and in front of your eyes, until if a period passes, you see the growth with your eyes apparently and know the ratio of its increase over what it was. Reason witnesses that for every hour there is a share of growth of that tree which you did not distinguish with your sight. This, if you ponder it, is very much. We have explained in the Chapter of Discourse on Quality in this register the sharing of Reason with Senses in all their perceived objects and its being unique without them in many things. Were it not for Reason, we would not have known what is absent from Senses, nor known God Almighty. Whoever denies his Reason has denied the testimony...",

By Thought (Fikr) and Memory (Dhikr), premises are taken a correct taking by the Soul looking into joining the natures of things to one another until its desire is established regarding what it wants to know. This Memory is established in animals. Animals may differ in degree in it: Among animals are those that distinguish their master and remember him even if he is absent from them, and rejoice in him if he comes to them; the strongest in that are the elephant, dog, monkey, and bear, then the cat. Among animals are those that remember a lesser remembrance, like the horse and camel. Among animals are the rest of what we mentioned that do not remember anything of that, like the rooster and others. Know that Sense, Reason, Opinion (Zann), and Imagination (Takhayyul) are powers among the powers of the Soul. As for Thought (Fikr), it is the judgment of the Soul regarding what these powers delivered to it. You find the Soul, if it loses something it stored due to forgetfulness, seeks it and inspects its memories by Thought, just as the owner of goods inspects his goods if he lost them and they mixed for him among various things; so he searches for them in one mode and place after place until he finds them and returns to them, or does not find them at all. Thus exactly same to same; glory be to the Disposer of that and its Inventor, there is no god but He. There is nothing in the powers we mentioned [80v] that is trusted always in every case except Reason. In it is the discrimination of the perceptions of sound Senses and those forsaken by illness and the like, such as the sick finding honey bitter like colocynth, while Reason testifies with correct, truthful testimony that it is sweet. And as a thing is seen in water contrary to its shape which Reason testifies is its shape in reality. As for Opinion (Zann), it is the most lying guide, because it pictures for you the huge armed man as brave while he might be the utmost coward, and pictures for you the disparate in appearance as dull while he might be extreme in intelligence. God Almighty alerted to this, saying: {Indeed, it is not the eyes that are blinded, but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts} (22 Al-Hajj: 46). So He, Mighty and Majestic, informed that Senses follow Reason, and that the possessor of Reason whose desire overcomes him does not benefit from what his senses perceived. And Almighty said: {Indeed, some assumption is sin} (49 Al-Hujurat: 12). It is narrated from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that he said: \"Assumption (Zann) is the falsest of speech.\" As for Imagination, it may make you hear a sound where there is no sound, and show you a person where there is no person.

And Almighty said, blaming one who turned away from using his reason: {And how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they, therefrom, are turning away} (12 Yusuf: 105). And Almighty said regarding everything for which no demonstration is established: {Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"} (2 Al-Baqarah: 111). And He said blaming one who spoke without knowledge: {Here you are - those who have argued about that of which you have [some] knowledge, but why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge?} (3 Aal Imran: 66). And Almighty said in the like of that: {But they have denied that which they encompass not in knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet come to them} (10 Yunus: 39). These are the commandments of the First One which His Messenger, peace be upon him, brought to us, and these are the requirements of intellects. So where is the escape from the Creator Almighty and from the Reason leading to knowing Him, except to the accursed Satan, destructive madness, and clear error? We ask the Granter of blessing to increase us in virtuous knowledge, and not to strip us of what He granted us of Reason and the love of using it and believing its testimonies. To Reason we return in the validity of Religion and the validity of Action leading to the success of the Hereafter and eternal safety. By it we know the reality of Knowledge, exit the darkness of Ignorance, and reform the management of Livelihood, the World, and the Body. Among people are those who cite Reason to validate something which Reason only invalidates; like one seeking in Reason causes necessitating the particulars of Sharias. For there is nothing in Reason except the obligation of obeying the First Creator only in whatever [81r] He commanded, even if by types of killing ourselves—less than which is Tuberculosis (consumption) (1); or a cause necessitating the prohibition of pork and permission of goat meat; or obligating prayer after the sun's decline and preventing it at its rising; or why a prayer is four rak'ahs and another three; or fasting Ramadan excluding Dhu al-Hijjah; or Hajj to Mecca in Dhu al-Hijjah excluding other months; and killing one who commits adultery while chaste (Muhsan) whether the husband of the woman or her father pardons or does not (2) pardon; or forbidding the killing of one who killed a forbidden soul if the guardian pardons him.

He created the donkey a lowly creation for labor, created the horse for riding, endowed the form of man with Reason, empowered the dog over the gazelle, permitted the slaughter of some animals for eating excluding others, created some animals flying, some aquatic, some food for others, some rational, some ignorant, some with two legs, some with four (1) legs, some with six legs, some with more than that, and some without legs also. He created the lion brave and bold, and the monkey cowardly and anxious. He created things with sharp vision and created the mole blind. He created venomous creatures harmful to animals. Thus the Generous Creator arranged all things. It binds one who flees from this to [saying] that the Soul did that [...] in necessitating incapacity or indulgence in futility regarding the Creator, according to his principle; Exalted is He above that. We clarified that in \"Al-Fisal\" with a healing explanation. Reason is only a power by which the Soul distinguishes all existents on their ranks, or witnesses by it what passed upon it of their true attributes only, and negates by it from them what is not in them. This is the reality of the definition of Reason. Senses follow it in that exactly. This discrimination is the perception of Reason; there is no perception other than it. As for the definition of the benefit of Reason in using acts of obedience and virtues, this definition implies avoiding sins and vices. Discussion on this and other things connected [to it] is exhaustive, God Almighty willing, in our book \"On the Ethics of the Soul.\" Know that for the vast majority of people, stupidity and weakness of minds prevail over them. The virtuous rational person is rare and few indeed. This is taken by sense. The text has come with that from the First Creator and from His Chosen One sent to us, peace be upon him. Almighty said: {And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of God} (6 Al-An'am: 116). And the Messenger of God [81v], peace be upon him, said: \"People are like a hundred camels; you can hardly find a riding mount among them.\" As for [what] the people of weak minds think is Reason while it is not Reason and Reason has no entry in it, they have erred in that greatly.

But if it is by whatever is possible of lying, hypocrisy, wasting a duty, wronging a human, and assisting in falsehood, it is the opposite of Reason—after the prohibition of God Almighty coming to us blaming this state a correct blame. So how can what Reason blames, invalidates, and forbids be Reason? Reason was never found blaming these vices, nor did the Command from God Almighty ever come except blaming them. Likewise, what others thought—that praiseworthy Reason which should not be opposed is adhering to familiar fashions—has no meaning. If you acquired it, is it anything but silliness and ignorance? This is not of Reason in anything. The explanation of this is mentioned in our book on \"Ethics of the Soul and Virtuous Conduct\" and in our book on \"Politics,\" God Almighty willing. God Almighty is the Granter of success to every virtue. Know that things are not perceived in their realities except by one who strips himself of all desires, looks into all opinions with a single equal look not leaning to any of them, and inspects the character of his own self with his reason an inspection that leaves nothing of desire and imitation in it at all. Then he walks with his reason the path we described in this register and avoids what is other than it among what we have shown the signs of all of. Whoever does what we said, perceiving truths in their modes in every quest is guaranteed for him. God Mighty and Majestic alerted to that in His covenants to us, saying: {They follow not except assumption and what [their] souls desire, and there has already come to them from their Lord guidance} (53 An-Najm: 23). And Almighty said: {They follow not except assumption, and indeed, assumption avails not against the truth at all} (53 An-Najm: 28). And Almighty said: {So give good tidings to My servants - Who listen to speech and follow the best of it. Those are the ones Allah has guided, and those are people of understanding} (39 Az-Zumar: 17-18). Know that people, except whom God Almighty protected—and how few they are—denounce the action of one who judges by desire, mislead one who imitates, and invalidate imitation. Yet they do not speak a word after this except it returns to one of these two malicious ways whose ugliness and the error of whose follower they have testified to. Contemplate this, you will find it often. Suffice is God Almighty's blame of these when He says: {Why do you say what you do not do? Great is hatred in the sight of God that [82r] you say what you do not do} (61 As-Saff: 2-3). We seek refuge in God from His hatred. However, we say: One who does good from one aspect and evil from another is better than one who does evil from every aspect. These are hated for doing contrary to...",

Since we have brought a sufficient sentence of this purpose—although speech on that is very long and broad—let us cut short, according to our doctrine in this register of brevity and clarification, God Almighty willing. Let us take, by the power of our Creator, to the quality of Debate, its praiseworthy and blameworthy modes, and its ranks, for it is connected to what preceded, God Almighty willing. 17 - Chapter on the Divisions of Questioning about what you want to know the reality of, among what is ascended to by proofs returning to the Primaries we presented: Know that knowledge of a truth is not reached by inference except by Search (Bahth). Search is via the thought of one, or via reminder from two: either from a teacher to a learner, or from two differing debaters researching. This mode is the utmost by which we reach the clarification of truths due to the abundance of investigation in it, such that fulfilling its right leaves no remainder at all. We say, and by God Almighty is success and we are supported: Know that necessarily, at the beginning of questioning about every questioned object among what is ascended to by proofs returning to the Primaries we presented, there are four questions, and for each there is an answer. The first is the Question with \"Hal\" (Is it?). We say: Is this thing existing or not? Is such matter true or not? The questioned must then answer by necessity with No or Yes. If he says No or says I do not know, the question about it drops in every case. Because the questioned thing is not devoid of being what is perceived by Reason and Senses, or what is perceived by Consequences (Tawali) of the premises we described. If it is what is perceived by Senses or Reason, speech with one denying that is futile, likewise with one doubting it. If it is what is perceived by Consequences, the question about it also drops, not because he is defeated, but [because] he did not establish a thing so one can proceed (1) with him in searching for it, and because he told the truth about himself when he said I do not know.

Whoever wants to bind him to acknowledge a matter must clarify it to him and establish it for him. The obligation is that no one believes a thing for which no proof has been established [82v], and that he believes it if proof is established for it. As for a person invalidating by demonstrations what an affirmer affirmed without demonstration, it is a volunteer act from him and a strength, but that is not obligatory on him, since the affirmer of a thing without demonstration is a claimant, and a claim falls if no proof supports (1) it. The origin in the structure is that man is born knowing nothing, then he hears sayings. Everyone considers his own opinion good. So there is no way to bind him to acknowledge any of them at all unless a demonstration necessitates the validity of one of them, so it binds him then. Otherwise, some are not more worthy of belief than others. There is no way for all of them to be true so that one believes all of them. Negating all of them and doubting them is possible until Demonstration stands on the validity of the correct one among them. If he answers with Yes and validates what was asked about, he is asked then by the second rank, which is the Question with \"Ma\" (What is it?). It follows the Question with \"Hal\". It is said to him: Since you verified it, what is it? Meaning: Inform us of its substance, definition, description, or what you can inform us about regarding the attributes of its essence adhering to it. If he informs with what he informs, he is asked by the third rank, which is the Question with \"Kayfa\" (How is it?). Meaning: This which you verified, what is its state? How is its configuration? How is the existence of what you affirmed for it in it? If he informs us with what he informs, he is asked by the fourth rank, which is \"Lima\" (Why?). It is said to him: Why was what you brought as you described? What is your demonstration for the validity of what you claimed of what you mentioned? There is no question against him regarding what he did not mention—whether he omitted or [did not] omit—except by claiming contradiction or refutation against him. Whoever affirms that against him must establish the demonstration on the validity of the contradiction or refutation he attributed to him. In this fourth rank, objection and seeking proofs or their clarification (2) occurs. An example of that is you say: Does a lunar eclipse exist or not? The answerer says: Yes, it exists. If he said No, it is said to him: Then what is this blackness appearing on the middle night of the month? If he denies the visual evidence, he becomes (3) in the category of those not spoken to. If he acknowledges it, it is said to him: It is what we intend by our saying \"Eclipse\".",

If he verifies, it is said to him: What is it? He says: It is the departure of light from the moon due to the entry of the earth between it and the sun from which it accepts light. The questioner says: How does the earth enter between the sun and the moon? The answerer says: By the sun being in a degree opposite to the degree the moon is in, with the intersection of their two orbits. The questioner says: Why was that? The answerer says then: The configuration of the sphere, the transfer of the sun and its traversing [83r], the transfer of the moon and the duration of its traversing (1), and what completes this meaning. This saying applies to every questioned object in every science. Know that it is not permissible to advance a delayed one of these four (2) ranks over what we arranged before it, because it is speech contrary to the familiar. Know that the one questioned with Ma, Kayfa, and Lima answers in the response with what is possible for him, not exiting the requirement of the questioner. Except that what is necessary in the Question [with Ma] is that he informs the questioner of the Definition (Hadd) of the questioned thing or its Description (Rasm). And if with Kayfa: it is that he answers with the general states of the thing and [those of] others, or the common specific ones, or what distinguishes it from others if the questioned thing is an individual. If he is asked with Lima, [he is] to answer with the Cause necessitating the existence of what he reported exists, and describe the Cause with its description that others do not share. The Cause should be adhering to what is inferred by it, like killing; for it is the cause of killing-death, since it is not permissible that there be killing and no death. Death is an effect of killing, but not every death is an effect of killing, since there is death without killing. Likewise, death is not a cause for killing. The Definition is taken from the attribute of the thing which is the attribute of its element (genus), and taken from its completion (differentia) also. Like your saying if asked about the definition of Medicine: 'A craft'—this is the element of Medicine—then you say: 'curing for the bodies of people'. By this the [definition] of Medicine is completed and it becomes Medicine. If asked about Disease: 'Weakness occurring in the body by the enmity of its humors and their exit from moderation'. Weakness is the element of Disease, and the enmity of humors is its completion, and by it it is named Disease. Likewise your saying in the definition of the Breather: It is...",

The Definition and Description in everything we mentioned and in everything asked about should be such that you answer with what indicates its defined and described object. Like your saying: 'Every line is either straight or curved, and everything that is either straight or curved is a line.' 'Every body is long, wide, deep, and every long, wide, deep thing is a body.' This is necessary for everything you described in every time, every place, and every state. If you want to verify, let that be with the wording of Affirmation and its meaning. For if you said 'Hot' or 'Cold', you affirmed a necessary meaning. If you want to negate, let that be with the wording of Negation and its meaning. For if you said 'Not hot', you did not affirm a meaning at all in any way. Likewise if you said 'Not a body', 'Not an accident'. The non-hot may be cold, may be moderate, and may be a celestial nature into which none of these attributes enter. If you want to divide, you should [83v] be cautious of the likes of this by not leaving a part except you verified it—either by a particle of negation so the burden is sufficed, or by inspecting all parts one by one and looking: is there a corrupt or added (1) one, or a possible negation? And from what we mentioned regarding the conditions of placing the negation particle in its place.

This one, being on certainty of his affair by a decisive demonstration, wants to deliver to his debater a part of the truth like what he has, and tries to solve the doubt of this erring opponent or the sophist, exposing his secret in sophistry and repelling his evil. Or one of them is certain as we presented, and the second has not stood upon the clarification of truth, so he seeks truth and standing upon it. If it happens that the two debaters are like this, that is a virtuous debate of praiseworthy consequence; it is about to resolve into a guaranteed good or an abundant reward. It is what God Almighty commanded saying: {And argue with them in a way that is best} (16 An-Nahl: 125). And Almighty saying: {Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction} (16 An-Nahl: 125). And Almighty saying: {Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"} (2 Al-Baqarah: 111). No one ever dispraised this debate except a silly, ignorant person of blameworthy nature, spoiling things for people, having made this aversion a curtain before his ignorance; he was not content to deprive himself of good until he strove to deprive others of it. But if both debaters are erring, or one is an ignorant [84r] seeker and the second is erring or a sophist, that is a debate where rioting abounds, fatigue becomes great, shouting increases, anger intensifies, and its harm is about to intensify. As for benefit, there is no benefit. Perhaps the ignorant therein rushes to accept what strikes his hearing without correct demonstration, so he perishes by believing falsehood and accepting it. As for if he were a rational certain person, guaranteed for him is the shattering of the structure by regret and rage, except that he is praised in supporting the truth, rewarded for that, and perhaps he benefits a listener. The bond of that is that a third party does not speak a word between them unless he sees apparent injustice, so he testifies to it. And that one does not cut off the speech of his companion until he completes it. And that speech from them does not prolong where there is no benefit. And that they proceed to brevity that does not fall short of exhaustive clarification. If one of them errs and wants retraction, that is his right, and it is obligatory on the other to accept his retraction, because a man's saying is not a part of him, but it is obligatory on him to leave error if he knows it is error. The preventer of retraction is unjust, riotous, ignorant. Likewise, if he sees his argument is corrupt and wants to leave it and take another, that is his right and he does well in that.

If they dispute over speech or dispute over speaking—like each saying: 'I will ask,' or each saying to the other: 'You be the questioner'—this is incapacity from both and lack of confidence: either in the power to support the saying he wants to clarify, or in the validity of the saying itself. If it is due to lack of confidence in the strength of his support, let him expand in knowledge and not expose himself to debate until he is strong; he is like the coward who does not attend the fight, weakening his sect. If it is due to lack of confidence in the validity of the saying, this one is very blameworthy for staying on a saying he does not trust its validity. It is obligatory on them in general to agree on a matter to open the speech with. As for us, our way in that is giving the opponent the choice to be questioner or questioned. Whichever he chooses, we answer him. If he returns the choice to us, we choose that he be the questioner, because this action is the most intended by the weak and the mainstay of their desire, as they weaken if questioned. So we choose cutting off their excuses and fulfilling their utmost demands in which they think they are stronger, so that it is stronger in cutting their attachments. Then if he changes his mind in that and chooses to ask [be asked?], we answer him to that also. However, we do not judge that for others because it is not obligatory. Whoever chooses to be a questioner and his opponent permits him that, he has the right to ask. He does not have the right to be arbitrary and leave that [84v] and move to be questioned. If he does, this is incapacity and a breach in the rule of debate. We choose for the virtuous not to be strict in that, out of our desire to show the truth and lack of joy in overcoming. Thus it is obligatory for everyone who follows our path. Whoever permits his opponent to be the questioner, it is obligatory on him in the rule of debate to answer. If he does not, it is out of injustice or ignorance, unless there is a fearsome ruler preventing declaring the answer; we do not speak with fears. Debate is only with safety—except for one who sacrificed himself for God Almighty and knew what he seeks and what he sacrifices of that; for him is success if he intended supporting Islam or the Truth in what Muslims differed in only. I do not see that the rational Muslim descends from himself [degrades himself]; nothing existing in his time from the Creator is dearer to him than it, nor more obligatory in sanctity except what contains its eternal success only. The rational sees no price for himself except Paradise. Whoever asked and his opponent answered him, then he fell silent from objecting, this is a place where the debate they started has ended (been cut off), unless another is resumed—unless there is fear as we presented.

Except what is of that not needing proof due to its clarity and the audience's equal knowledge of it. Victory (Falj) (2) in debate is the appearance of the true Demonstration only. The interruption (silencing) of the opponent is not victory (3). He may be silenced out of ignorance, fear, or a preoccupation of mind that befell him. All that is not a cutting of the truth if it is in his hand. The testimony of those present to the victory of one of them is nothing, since they might be agreeing in their opinion with his opinion for whom they testified; so their path and his path are one. Fairness among people is rare. They might not be realizing what they say nor understanding what they hear; this is very frequent. Whoever is cut off from opposing his opponent due to incapacity to answer, not due to a preventing fear, he is the defeated one, not his saying.

Demonstration never contradicts itself. What is valid by demonstration, another demonstration never invalidates it, unless it is of what transforms—like a demonstration valid by Zayd's life yesterday, then another valid by his death today. Thus is everything whose transfer is possible; it does not transfer by anything we mentioned of what is valid [85r] by demonstration except by another demonstration. Otherwise, the judgment of the first demonstration remains (4). A thing does not transfer from Possibility to Necessity except by a demonstration, nor transfer after Necessity to Possibility except by a demonstration. Stubbornness and denial are shame, sin, and silliness. Know that if the questioner says to his opponent: 'What is your say in such?', the answer is delegated to the questioned to answer as he wishes. But if he says to him: 'Is matter such-and-such true?', he must answer either with Yes or No. Like a questioner asking: 'What do you say about the earth, is it spherical or not?' He must have Yes or No. 'What do you say about wine, is it lawful or not?' Likewise. Or he says to him: 'Does Void exist or not?' He must have Yes or No. Likewise if the questioner asks...",

'What do you say about the earnings of a cupper, is it recommended, forbidden, or disliked?' If the divisions are exhaustive, the questioned must commit to one of those divisions. If he does not do so, he is cut off (silenced) in reality. If they are not exhaustive, the questioner is ignorant or stubborn. If the interruption of the opponent appears, the predecessors [say]: It is not upon the questioner to clarify the truth. As for us, we say: That is upon him. Whoever invalidates a judgment, it is upon him to clarify his saying: either to enter into the like of what he invalidated, or to clear the confusion. Clarifying truths is an obligation; God Almighty took a covenant from scholars to clarify what they knew and not hide it. If the opponent exhausts the divisions and adds a corrupt division to them, the other does not have the right to leave what they are in and take to arguing in clarifying the extra division he added. But he says to him: 'You added a corrupt division which is such-and-such. I only mentioned it to you so you do not circulate it against me, so my silence about it would be like my acknowledgment of it to one who is not fair. But I am harmed by that, and I commit to the divisions you mentioned, division such-and-such, which is the correct one.' Know that whoever leaves what he is in with his opponent of debate and exits to another issue is an ignorant, riotous persuader (1). Like what we witnessed often of one who left what they were about and started pursuing his companion's grammatical errors in his speech. We do not say this to support grammatical errors and leave being busy with other than what they started in. The opponent has no more right than to express his intent with what his opponent understands; there is no addition [required] with whatever word and whatever language it is—except that we choose brevity—but to support the Truth Gathering [85v] many meanings from few, simple, easy, eloquent words for whoever is capable of that. Otherwise, there is no blame on him except in one place: that the questioner asks him, and the questioned knows that the questioner holds a view by which he returns to binding the opponent or to contradiction. His answer here is to say to him: 'What do you say in such?' Meaning: 'I hold your view.' If the one opposed by this says to him: 'I do not say what you think, nor do I say anything, nor do I support a hopeful answer; I am only a seeker of demonstration, and my error is not upon you; so support your saying or admit error.' It is obligatory then not to oppose him with a question at all, but with a demonstration by which he clarifies the validity of his saying only.",

This action is error from two aspects: One is that he is truthful in his admission of the invalidity of his saying and his return from it and his seeking knowledge of the truth; this is a great virtue and its doer is very praiseworthy. The second is that he has known that his opponent brings the like of that, so he wants to bind him with the like of what he bound him, to restrain his rioting from himself; this is fairness. An example of that is that one of the opponents says: 'Debate (Jidal) is disliked.' The other says: 'If it is disliked, by what thing is knowledge of the truth reached according to you, regarding what those you consider satisfactory of your creed differed in? Bring [what] you have and leave debate aside now.' This returns to what we said before of modes of divisions that are all invalid except one, so that one becomes valid. The opponent then must mention Imitation (Taqlid), or Inspiration (Ilham/Delusion), or abandoning the search for truth. All these modes are invalid and corrupt. If they are invalid, Debate is valid. This which we said restricts the opponent to this mode of the modes of Demonstration, so he returns to the truth or is cut off either by silence or slander he brings. We mentioned in the Chapter of Divisions of Knowledge what the ignorant opponent is opposed with of things the ignorant (1) count as proof while they are not proof at all. It is obligatory to restrain the harm of their ignorance of them in every case. Know that it is an error to oppose Error with Error in debate. Like the questioner saying to the questioned: 'You say such and such', 'Did you not say such and such?' The answerer says: 'And you also say such and such', or 'Because you also say such and such'. He brings him the like of what he denied on him or more heinous. All this is a gross error, great shame, and following error. Except in [86r] two places: One is that the saying the answerer objected with is a correct saying producing what he says; this is a virtuous mode and a cutting of the questioner. That is like a Mu'tazili saying to another: 'Why did you say God Almighty is the Creator of Evil?' He said: 'Because you say with me that Almighty created the entire world, its substances and accidents; and evil is an accident; so God Almighty is the Creator of Evil.' This is a correct opposition, except that the appearance of its wording is not precise, because in appearance he made the cause of his saying what he says to be his opponent's saying what he says. It implies for him that were it not for his opponent saying that, he would not have said what he said. This is an error. The correct way is to say...",

The second way is if the questioner is a rioter intending defamation, incitement, and rebuke, and does not intend to seek a truth. It is obligatory to break his sharpness and deter his fault with the like of this only. He should not be debated with more than that, since the purpose is only restraint, and his harm is not restrained by a correct debate at all; so nothing is more restraining to his harm than what we mentioned. Know that it is not permissible for a thing to validate itself at all, but it is permissible for it to invalidate itself. Do not think that the Primaries from which Demonstration is taken validated themselves, thus erring; rather, those are things we mentioned that Creation validated, and no person of understanding was ever devoid of knowing their validity. Do not think either that invalidating a thing by itself is a validation of it, thus erring. It was not invalidated by itself because it validated its invalidation by it—for then it would be a validater and an invalidater, which is impossible. But when it was invalidated by itself, we became certain it is false, because the correct Truth is never invalidated at all, and because it contradicted its own judgment; and everything that is contradicted is false. The saying of one who said, invalidating speculation (Nazar): \"Speculation is not valid except by speculation,\" is not a correct saying. Because the Speculation by which things become valid is returning them to the Primary Premises which Nature judged to be valid. Whatever returns to them and they testify for it is correct, and whatever does not return to them is corrupt. This is the Speculation by which things become valid, because Speculation is only valid by another Speculation. If the judgment is cut off (silenced), the debate is cut off. They have the right then to begin a second question. The silenced one has the right then to say: \"I ask you a question connected to our issue, and I bind you to say like my saying which you denied upon me.\" The other has no right to refuse that; if he refuses, he is a weak evader. If the other fulfills a condition, both are blameworthy if they do not return to the truth when the questioned is unable to differentiate between the two sayings. Just as we blame one to whom a demonstration appears yet he persists in falsehood and does not return [86v] to the requirement of the demonstration, we likewise blame one who rushes to accept what he hears without a demonstration. And just as we praise one who returns to the requirement of the demonstration, we likewise praise one who remains firm on its requirement and does not return due to auditory persuasion or sophistry. If he is unable to break them, and these premises are established for the two debaters (1), praised is he who believes only what the demonstration necessitated.",

Accept his retraction if he errs. Do not leave a problem except you make him stand upon it; if it settles free of deficiency and ambiguity, then answer. Everything you demand of your opponent regarding that, commit to the like of it yourself, exactly. Clarify your question [to be] free from deficiency and ambiguity. Beware of introducing what is not part of the debate; this is the action of madmen or one who wants to prolong speech so the end makes the beginning forgotten, to forget his error and slip. Contemplate his premises and your premises, your conversion and his conversion, his results and your results. Do not be pleased for yourself from your opponent except with the clear truth. Know that it is not upon a person more than supporting the truth and clarifying it. Then it is not upon him to visualize for the senses or in souls what there is no way to visualize, nor what has no form at all. Like one who proves that the First One is neither substance, nor accident, nor body, nor in time, nor in place, nor a carrier, nor carried; and the opponent wants him to form a shape of that for him. This is not binding. This is like a blind man tasking a sighted man to visualize colors for him; this is what there is no way to. This is a corrupt tasking; incapacity regarding it is not a deficiency in the tasked. As for what remains possible, it is obligatory on the tasked to explain it to the utmost he can. My tutor Ahmed bin Muhammad bin Abdul Warith, may God have mercy on him, told me that his father modeled the letters of the alphabet for a son he had who was born blind, as bodies from tar (pitch). Then he made him touch them until he understood their forms with his reason and sense. Then he made him touch their composition and the establishment of things from them until the script was formed [in his mind] and how writing is clarified and read in himself; he lifted a great distress from him by that. As for colors, there is no way to that regarding them; there is nothing but what demonstration established, even if it is not formed in the soul at all. I was tested once by some of our friends; he tasked us to show him the Accident sifted from the Substance, standing by itself. He said to me: \"If you do not show me that, I will not believe in the Accident.\" I cannot count how many times I squared a triangle for him, then rounded it, and [showed] the departure [87r] of the squareness and the remaining of the clay as it was; and the movements of a person from his standing and sitting; and the redness of a garment after its whiteness. He refused all that unless I showed him the Accident removed from the Substance, remaining as it is, seeing it in other than a substance. I cannot count how many times I told him: \"If the Accident stood by itself and was as you want from me, it would not be an accident; it is only...",

As for the whole world, it is a solid sphere and a connected jewel (substance) with adjacent parts; there is no porosity (rarefaction) in it nor gap (2). Even if an accident separated from a substance and it was permissible for it to remain after its separation from it, it would only end up in another substance.\" This mockery did not deter him from what occurred in his soul, and I left him refusing. I do not know if he was guided after me to reject this agitated desire or not. Such corrupt tasking, and the fact that truths are not formed for a person [visually], is not a flaw in the demonstration nor something to pay attention to. It suffices from that, and is enough for us, the establishment of the validity of that in the soul by the indication of Reason that it is true only. If it were permissible for everyone for whom a thing is not formed in his soul to deny it, it would be permissible for the one with no sense of smell to deny scents, and the one born blind to deny colors, and for us to deny the elephant and the giraffe. All this is false. Rather, the rational person must affirm what Demonstration affirmed and invalidate what Demonstration invalidated, and pause regarding what a demonstration neither affirmed nor invalidated until the truth appears to him. Likewise, it is not upon us to force tongues to acknowledge the truth, but it is upon us to force souls to acknowledge it and to cut off tongues from correct opposition due to its non-existence, since Demonstration does not contradict itself. If we established it, we are safe from our opponent establishing it. Likewise, if a person falls short of establishing demonstration for a truth he believes, that does not harm the truth a bit. None rejoices at this from his opponent except one who rejoices in wishful thinking, which is the fool who is cited as an example. Do not be content with the negligence of your opponent regarding all that can validate his saying. If you find a truth by demonstration, return to it and do not hesitate. Do not be pleased for yourself to remain an hour refusing to accept the truth. If you find a deception, clarify it, and do not be deceived by your opponent missing it, for perhaps another of the people of his doctrine will notice what he missed. Furthermore, do not be content except with the reality of victory. Do not mind if it is said about you that you are a falsifier; you have in those attributed with that among the verifiers a most noble model, among the Prophets, peace be upon them, and those below them.

The session broke up with me being the victor. When I came to my house, something wavered in my soul about it. I sought it in some books and found a correct demonstration showing the invalidity of my saying and the correctness of my opponent's saying. One of our companions who witnessed that session was with me, so I informed him of that. Then I marked the place in the book and said to him: \"What do you want?\" [He said:] \"Carrying this book, presenting it to So-and-so, and informing him that he is the verifier and I am the falsifier and that I am returning (1) to his saying.\" A perplexing matter attacked him from that, and he said to me: \"And your soul permits this?!\" I said to him: \"Yes, and if I could do that in this time of mine, I would not delay it to tomorrow.\" Know that this action earns you the most beautiful mention along with adorning yourself with fairness which nothing equals. Let not your purpose be to delude yourself that you are a victor, or to delude those present who are deceived by you and trust your judgment that you are a victor while you are in reality defeated. You would be, then, mean, very low, absolutely silly, and of fallen ambition; like one who deludes himself that he is an obeyed king while he is a wretched unfortunate, or in the category of one who is told \"You are white and beautiful\" while he is black and deformed, becoming a mockery and laughingstock among people of intellect whose judgment is the truth.",

The Ancients mentioned regarding the description of the 'Cut-off' (Defeated/Silenced) modes which we mention: One is that he intends invalidating the truth or doubting it.

The fourth is using obscure speech which the rational thinks is full of wisdom while it is full of prattle.

By my life, most of his speech he does not understand, let alone others.

You find one of this description being stingy to his brother and neighbor with stinking manure at his donkey's leg, spending it [only] for one who benefits from it, yet he is the most generous of people with speech—by which he is distinct from he-goats and dogs—in other than reward or righteousness, but in falsehood, sin, and corruption. Even if he obtains nothing from that outwardly except the congestion of his chest tubes, the headache of his head, the heating of his temper, and that he acts foolishly and is acted foolishly against. Another category supports what he tied his intention to and believed without demonstration. He does not care what he supports—truth, falsehood, impossible, stubbornness, or harm. Likewise, you do not find him believing what he believed except by familiarity, imitation, or desire, without seeking truth nor avoiding falsehood. These are many, and they are below the first ones. A third category intends nothing but supporting the Truth and suppressing Falsehood. These are very few; I do not know in existents anything less [89v] than it at all. We ask God Almighty to establish us in their number and not leave us void of this noble attribute by His grace, Amen. For the rational person should hate spending his life and speech—by which his Creator distinguished him from inanimate objects and other animals—in other than what benefits him for his Hereafter, more than he hates spending his money which comes and goes. Know that what we mentioned of standing upon truths is only by intense search. Intense search is only by much reading of all opinions and sayings, looking into the natures of things, listening to the argument of every arguer, looking into it and inspecting, and supervising religions, sects, schools, choices, people's differences, and reading their books. Whoever among the ignorant dispraises what we mentioned has opposed his Lord Almighty. For He, Mighty and Majestic, informed us in His revealed Book of the sayings of the differers among the people of denial saying the world is eternal, the people of Dualism, the people of Trinity, and the atheists, in the description of all that, to show us Almighty their contradiction and the corruption of their sayings. Then we return and say: It is necessary for the seeker of truths to view the Quran, its meanings, the narration of its words, and its rulings; and the Hadith of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and his biographies gathering all praiseworthy virtues in the world and leading to the Hereafter. It is necessary with that to read ancient and modern history (News), supervise the division of lands (Geography), know Astronomy (Hay'ah), and stand upon the language in which translated books are read, and investigate its usage.

This is collected in the book \"Al-Jumal\" by Abu al-Qasim Abdul Rahman bin [Ishaq] al-Zajjaji al-Dimashqi. As for all that preceded, let him increase of it as much as he can. For that, there are two limits: A limit which is the maximum (Goal), and a limit less than which one should not restrict himself to. The Greater Limit is not to be empty of looking into the sciences we presented except at times of performing obligatory duties, looking into what is necessary for livelihood, and leaving everything of worldly matters that can be dispensed with. Know that your looking into sciences with the intention of perceiving truths, denying falsehood, supporting truth, teaching it to people, guiding the ignorant, and knowing what you worship your Creator Almighty with—so you do not worship Him out of ignorance and err more than you are correct regarding the religion of God Almighty, the creed of Truth, and the correct doctrine in performing what He tasked you with Almighty [90r]—and your benefiting people in their religions, bodies, management of their affairs, execution of their rulings and politics, enlightening the one in charge of any of that, adjusting his nature, advising him in that with truth, making him understand, and making the ugly ugly to him—is better with God than everything by which one draws near to God Almighty, greater in reward, and more returning [benefit] upon you than all you earn—after what your body and eye have no subsistence without—of what you perhaps leave to one whom if you witnessed his action with it after you, it would enrage you. And [better] than every status that perhaps earns you nothing but sin, fear, fatigue, and rage. Know that that is greater in reward, better in consequence, and more beneficial than your gifting people dinars and dirhams. The harm of ignorance and error is more severe and greater than the harm of poverty and obscurity. Know that you do not bequeath High Status except to one who earns you good deeds while you are dead, and good mention while you are decayed bones; he mentions you only with every beautiful thing. You do not bequeath it after you nor accompany in your life on its path except every virtuous person. You do not accompany in seeking money and status except the likes of foxes and wolves. I tell you regarding that something I hope its reader benefits from, God Almighty willing. That is: I was detained in the hands of the one nicknamed Al-Mustakfi, Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman bin Ubayd Allah bin Al-Nasir, in a dungeon (Matbaq). I was not safe from his killing because he was an unjust, tyrannical, transgressing ruler, of little religion, much ignorance, untrusted, and unverified. Our sin with him was our companionship to Al-Mustazhir, may God be pleased with him.",

I was thinking about a difficult issue among the universals of sentences under which fall great meanings—regarding which rioting abounded anciently and recently in the rulings of religion, and its branches dispose in all chapters of Jurisprudence. My thought in it prolonged for days and nights until the face of clarification appeared to me in it, and it became correct and true for me with certainty in its judgment, and dawned. I was in the state I described. By God, other than Whom there is no god, the Creator, Disposer of all matters, I swear—by Whom it is not permissible to swear by other than Him—my joy that day, while I was in that state, at my victory with the truth in what my mind was busy with, and the shining of correctness for me, was more intense than my joy at my release from what I was in. We did not compose this book of ours, and much of what we composed, except while we were exiled, banished from homeland, family, and child, fearing alongside that for our lives from injustice and aggression. We do not hide this but announce it, and we do not enable the seeker to invalidate our saying in that. To God we complain, and Him we ask for judgment, no other; there is no god but He. As for the Lesser Limit which the rational person should [90v] [not] fall short of: Let him look at the time he isolates for superfluities of talk that does not suffice with his neighbors, or sitting idle without work—neither of Hereafter nor of World—or when walking in the land arrogantly (while his Creator forbade him from that). Let him make these times for learning and looking into the sciences we presented, and training his nature on Justice which is the head of every virtue. For Justice necessitates that he does not lean to a saying over a saying except by a clear demonstration. It necessitates for him also that he does not busy himself with the lower and leave the better. If he does so, he is about to succeed with what contains success in the Two Abodes. As for the times in which the people of ignorance busy themselves either with pleasures in sins, or with wronging people in their wealth, striving for corruption in their politics, attacking their honors, and being unjust to them—their busying themselves with diseases painful to their souls, harmful to their bodies, is more returning [benefit] upon them than that, and better. So how about busying with sciences leading to the good of the World and the success of the Hereafter? The First One has said: {It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah} (35 Fatir: 28). The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: \"Whomever God intends good for, He gives him understanding in religion.\" There is no understanding except by knowing what we mentioned...",

This rank is other than the rank that was with the Ancients, but we speak on what people benefit from in every time regarding what they reach their quest of perceiving sciences with, by the power of God Almighty and His strength. The sciences we mentioned are: Science of Quran, Science of Hadith, Science of Schools (Madhahib), Science of Fatwa (Jurisprudence), Science of Logic, Science of Grammar, Science of Language, Science of Poetry, Science of History (News), Science of Medicine, Science of Number (Arithmetic), Science of Geometry, and Science of Astronomy (Stars). Resulting from these are Sciences of Expression (Rhetoric) and Science of Eloquence. As for the Science of Quran, it is divided into sections [91r]: Science of its Readings, its Parsing (I'rab), its Strange words (Gharib), its Exegesis (Tafsir), and its Rulings (Ahkam). Returning to it regarding the Science of Quran Readings is [via] accepted premises returning to satisfactory known readers, returning to the Prophet, peace be upon him, for whom demonstrations established the validity of their transmission from him and the validity of his establishment. As for its Parsing, it is a correct premise in it: if the word is taken in it upon certain vowel movements and a certain form, it is a principle returned to. As for its Language (Gharib), it is the familiar from it in the Arabic language. As for its Rulings, [return is] to the concept of its words and to the clarification of the Prophet, peace be upon him, for them. As for Hadith, it is divided into two parts: Science of its Narrators and Science of its Rulings. As for its Narrators, the reference to it regarding them is premises transmitted from trustworthy people who testified to their probity (Justice) and proof; the testimony is taken from the Quran whose validity we mentioned. As for its Rulings, [return is] to the concept of its words and to the [indication] of some of them upon others, as we explained in other than this place.",

    "text": "As for the Science of Schools (Madhahib), whatever of it is outside the Islamic Creed, [return is] to premises returning to the primaries of Reason and Sense as we mentioned in the book \"Al-Fisal.\" As for the Science of Logic, we have explained it in this register; it is the expression over every science. As for the Science of Fatwa, [return is] to premises taken from the Quran and Hadith which were validated by demonstrations, and to the Consensus of virtuous scholars which was validated by the Quran as we explained in our other books. As for the Science of Grammar, [return is] to premises preserved from the Arabs, whose knowledge increases the understanding (1) of meanings in their language. As for the Causes ('Ilal) in it, they are very corrupt. As for the Science of Language, [return is] to what was also heard from the Arabs by the transmission of accepted trustworthy people that this is their language. As for the Science of Poetry, [return is] to what was also heard of their usage in meters specifically, excluding every meter used by others, since people only name 'Poetry' what is guaranteed by the Prosody meters only which Al-Nadim mentioned in his book. As for its good and bad, [return is] to things agreed upon by those who narrate it much and devote themselves to inspecting its meanings: of sweet easy wording, meaning gathering beauty, hitting a simile, fine metonymy, and marvelous composition. As for the Science of History (News), [return is] to premises which Recurrent Transmission (Tawatur) compelled the acknowledgement of their validity, regarding the existence of famous lands, known kings, their battles, and the rest of their news about which there is no doubt. As for the Science of Medicine, [return is] to premises validated by Experience or what appeared and became clear of the powers of diseases and what generates them from the disturbance of temperament, and opposing that with the powers of medicines [91v]. All that returns to the primaries of Reason and Sense. As for the Science of Arithmetic and Geometry, its premises are all from the primaries of Reason. As for the Science of Astronomy, it is divided into two parts: One is the Structure (Hay'ah) of Spheres, the traversing of stars, sun, moon, and heavens, the divisions of the Sphere and its centers. This part's premises return to Arithmetic, Geometry, and primaries of Reason and Sense. The second part is the Propositions (Judgments) occurring by the position of the transfer of the planet, sun, and moon in the Zodiac signs and their opposition to one another. If Experience validates anything of that, it is true; otherwise, there are only sayings from ancient people only.",

It reached us at the time of this composition of ours that our friend Ahmed bin Abdul Malik bin Shahid composed a book on that; he is among those firmly established in the science of Eloquence, very strong in it. He wrote to us informing us of that, but we have not seen the book yet. We are sufficed by the books we mentioned from going deep into speech in this affair. But we speak on it with comprehensive brevity, and refer to what others whom we named and whom we will name have explained, God Almighty willing. We say, and by God Almighty we are supported: Eloquence may differ in languages according to what the people of each language deem beautiful regarding the locations of words upon meanings which agree in every language. Strange (uncommon) words may be counted in Eloquence, but if their usage becomes frequent, they are no longer counted in Eloquence nor deemed beautiful. We say: Eloquence is what the commoner understands like the understanding of the elite. It should be with a wording the commoner is alerted to because he is not used to the like of its arrangement and meaning. It exhausts the entire intent, does not add to it what is not of it, nor omits anything needed of that request. It brings the understanding close to the one addressed by it, due to its clarity and bringing close what is distant. It multiplies meanings [92r] and makes its memorization easy due to its brevity and ease of words. The mainstay of that is brevity for the one who understands, explanation for the one who does not understand, abandoning repetition for the one who is told and understands, and persisting in repetition for the one who does not accept or is heedless.

Then people's eloquence is under these ways we mentioned. As for the composition of the Quran, its Revealer Almighty prevented the capability of its like and intervened between the eloquent ones and coming with what resembles it. Ibn Darraj had invented, in our view, a type of eloquence between speeches (Khutab) and epistles (Rasa'il). As for the Moderns, we say: They are distanced from Eloquence and close to Arrogance and Excess (Zayd/Zayf?), except Al-Hatimi and Badi' al-Zaman; they lean to the method of Sahl bin Harun. This is the reality of Eloquence and its meaning; we have gathered it, and praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds. It is necessary for one who wants the science of Eloquence to take a share in all sciences we presented before this. The most of this is Quran, Hadith, History (Akhbar), and the books of Amr bin Bahr. He must be, with that, naturally gifted (Matbu') in it; otherwise, he will not be eloquent. Natural talent does not benefit without expansion in sciences. The Book of Eloquence is completed, and praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds.",

Almighty informed that they say what they do not do. The Prophet, peace be upon him, forbade maximizing it; that is only because it is lying, except what exited the limit of [lying] poetry and came as wisdom, sermons, and praise of the Prophet, peace be upon him.

The lord of this chapter among the ancients is Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma, and among the moderns is Habib bin Aws (Abu Tammam). Nature is what has no affectation in it, and its wording is common with no excess over its meaning, such that if you wanted to express that meaning in prose, you would not bring an easier nor more concise (1) one than that wording. The lord of this chapter among the ancients is Jarir, and among the moderns is Al-Hasan. Brilliance is disposing in subtle and distant meanings, increasing in what people are not used to saying, hitting the simile, and improving the subtle meaning. The lord of this chapter among the ancients is Imru' al-Qais, and among the moderns is Ali bin Abbas al-Rumi. The poetry of other people returns to the divisions we mentioned and is composed of them. As for one who wants to become skilled in the divisions of poetry, its chosen parts, and the varieties of disposing in its beauties, let him look into the book of Qudama bin Ja'far on *Criticism of Poetry* and the book of Abu Ali al-Hatimi; in them is sufficient sufficiency and exhaustiveness for this meaning. A person being a poet is not acquired, but it is a trick (talent), except that we strengthen its possessor by expanding in poems and pondering them. Since we have spoken on Poetry with speech gathering its divisions, and our purpose is fulfilled, we say: This is the definition of Logic from which we warn against conjectures and leaving certainty.

The summary of his opinion is that God is not named except by what He named Himself, following the Text, without ever deviating from that. He said: Among what the people of Islam introduced in the names of God Almighty is \"Al-Qadim\" (The Old/Eternal). This is not permissible at all because no text authenticated it at all, and it is not permissible to name God Almighty with what He did not name Himself. God Almighty said: {And the moon We have determined for it phases, until it returned [appearing] like the old date-stalk.} So it is correct that \"Old\" (Qadim) is of the attributes of creatures, so it is not permissible to name God Almighty with that. \"Al-Qadim\" is only known in the language from temporal priority, meaning this thing is older (aqdam) than this by a limited duration. This is negated from God Almighty. God Almighty has sufficed against this naming with the word \"First\" (Awwal).

Which is: That we see Earth, Water, and earthen bodies like rocks and mercury, and similar things whose nature is 'Down' (Descent) always and seeking the Center and Middle, and that they do not leave this nature to ascend except by a force overcoming them and entering upon them—like our lifting water and stone by force. If we lift them, they rise; if we leave them, they return to their nature by sinking. We find Fire and Air, their nature is Ascent and distance from the Center and Middle. They do not leave this nature except by a forced movement entering upon them; that is seen visually like the blown skin (bellows) and the hollow vessel turned upside down in water. If that forced movement vanishes, they return to their nature. Then we find the vessel called 'Water Thief' (Clepsydra), [water] ascends in it and does not spill. We find the syringe (Zarraqah) lifts dirt, mercury, and water? And we find the cupping glass (Mahjamah) sucks the earthen body to itself. (In Al-Taqrib: Al-Mahsajah; perhaps the word Al-Mahjamah is the correct one). 11 - 72: See his epistle in *Mudarat al-Nufus*: 145 where he speaks about virtues in a Platonic manner. 8 - 80: And the error of those who thought... that the Name is the Named became clear: This is the title of a chapter in the book *Al-Fisal* \"Discourse on the Name and the Named\" 5: 27. Abu Muhammad said: A group went to [the view] that the Name is the Named, and others said the Name is other than the Named. Those who said the Name is the Named argued with the saying of God Almighty: {Blessed is the name of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor}, and it is also read {Owner} (Dhu) [referring to the Lord, not Name]. He said: It is not permissible to say 'Blessed is other than God'; if the Name were other than the Named, it would not be permissible to say 'Blessed is the name of your Lord'. And by His saying Almighty: {Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High}, etc. 5 - 104: *Al-Muqtadab* by Al-Mubarrad: A book on Grammar. There is a single copy of it in Koprulu (No: 1507 - 8) in four volumes, corrected by Al-Sirafi. Among the narrators of the book is Ibn al-Rawandi the Atheist. People neglected this book until it was said that the bad omen of Ibn al-Rawandi...",

He said: As for people's difference regarding Date (History), the Jews say the world is four thousand and some years old; the Christians say the world is five thousand years old. As for us, we do not decide on a known number with us. Whoever claimed regarding that seven thousand years or more or less has lied, and said what never came from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in a valid wording; rather, the contrary was authenticated from him, peace be upon him. 7 - 160: Ibn Hazm refers to a debate that took place between Mani and the Mobadh regarding the issue of cutting off progeny and hastening the emptying of the world. The Mobadh said: Are you the one who says marriage is forbidden to hasten the annihilation of the world and the return of every form to its form, and that is a necessary truth? Mani said to him: It is necessary to aid the Light in its liberation by cutting off progeny from the mixture it is in. Adurbadh said to him: Then of the necessary truth is to hasten this liberation for you which you call for, and to aid in invalidating this blameworthy mixture. Mani was silenced, so Bahram ordered Mani to be killed. (*Al-Fisal* 1: 36). 11 - 160: Muhammad bin Jarir al-Tabari and all Ash'aris—except Al-Simnani—went to [the view] that no one is a Muslim unless he infers (uses reasoning), otherwise he is not a Muslim. Al-Tabari said: Whoever reaches puberty (dreaming) or grows hair among men and women, or reaches menstruation among women, and does not know God Almighty with all His names and attributes by the way of Inference, is a disbeliever whose blood and wealth are lawful. He said: If the boy or girl reaches seven years, it is obligatory to teach them and train them in Inference for that (*Al-Fisal* 4: 35). 14 - 17: 180: Review *Rasail Ibn Hazm*: 144; there he spoke about the definition of Reason. He said: \"As for mastering the matter of the world, courting people with what agrees with them and improves the state of the courter—of falsehood and other things, or vice or otherwise—and trickery in growing...",

He said: Do not sacrifice yourself except in what is higher than it. That is only in the Essence of God Almighty, in calling to truth, in protecting the sanctuary (women/honor), in repelling humiliation not obligated upon you by your Creator Almighty, and in helping the oppressed. The sacrificer of himself for worldly goods is like the seller of rubies for pebbles. He said: The rational person sees no price for himself except Paradise. 15 - 192: Ahmed bin Muhammad bin Abdul Warith Abu Omar, known as Ibn Akhi al-Zahid (Nephew of the Ascetic), is Ibn Hazm's tutor in Grammar (See *Al-Takmila*: 790 and *Al-Jadhwah*: 99). 13 - 197: *Al-Luma'* by Abu al-Faraj the Judge: It is the book *Al-Luma'* in Principles of Jurisprudence by Abu al-Faraj al-Maliki Omar bin Muhammad, who died in the year 331 AH (See *Al-Fihrist*: 283 Egypt Ed.). 23 - 197: Classes of people in their speech: Ibn Hazm presented this idea briefly in his epistle \"Mudawat al-Nufus\": 147 of *Rasail Ibn Hazm*. 2 - 199: Abu al-Qasim al-Zajjaji and the book *Al-Jumal*: Abdul Rahman bin Ishaq al-Zajjaji died in the year 340 in Tiberias. His method in Grammar was intermediate, and his compositions intend benefit (See his biography in *Inbah al-Ruwat* No: 376; in the footnote is a list of references). As for the book *Al-Jumal*, there are many copies of it today. Multiple commentaries have been written on it as well. The Andalusians cared for it; they explained it and explained its verses. Among that is the commentary on verses by Al-Shantamari. Al-Batalyawsi composed a book on it he named \"The Robes in Correcting the Defect Occurring in the Book of Al-Jumal.\" Ibn Kharuf has a commentary on it, and Ibn Hariq has a commentary on its verses. Likewise Ibn Asfour and Ahmed bin Yusuf al-Fihri al-Labli have a commentary on its verses \"Washy al-Hulal fi...",

He appointed Ibn Hazm and Ibn Shahid as ministers. Then Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman al-Nasiri revolted against him in the month of Dhu al-Qi'dah of the same year and killed him. He was pledged allegiance as Caliph and nicknamed Al-Mustakfi. He was backward and weak. He imprisoned Ibn Hazm and his cousin Abu al-Mughira. He stayed in the Caliphate for sixteen months. After that, the command of Cordoba returned to Banu Hammud, and Al-Mustakfi fled to the frontier region and died in his exile. 5 - 201: Dispelling Worry: Ibn Hazm treated this idea extensively in his epistle on Ethics (See *Rasail Ibn Hazm*: 116 and following, also the Introduction to the Epistles). 7 - 201: What Ibn Hazm said about sciences here, he explained extensively in an epistle of his titled \"Maratib al-Ulum\" (Ranks of Sciences); see *Rasail Ibn Hazm* 59 - 90. 2 - 204: Abu Amir Ahmed bin Abdul Malik bin Shahid (382 - 426), foster child of the Amirid state. The demise of Amirid glory in Cordoba affected him, but he did not emigrate from his country as Ibn Darraj or his friend Ibn Hazm did. He participated in political life when Al-Mustazhir came with Ibn Hazm, then praised Banu Hammud who overcame Cordoba. He was afflicted in his last days with paralysis that crippled him. He was extravagant in his generosity, intense in self-pride, leaning to humor and jest, admiring his poetry, mocking the sons of his people especially the class of tutors. He became famous among the Easterners for the epistle *Al-Tawabi' wa al-Zawabi'*. As for his book on Eloquence which Ibn Hazm mentions, Ibn Bassam cited some paragraphs from it in *Al-Dhakhira*. (See his biography in *Al-Dhakhira* 1/1: 61, *Al-Jadhwah*: 124, *Al-Mughrib* 1: 78, *Al-Matmah*: 16, *Al-Kharidah* 12: 201, *Al-Yatimah* 1: 382, and *I'tab al-Kuttab*: 74; I have written a detailed study on him in my book \"History of Andalusian Literature\" - under print -). 4 - 204: Qudama bin Ja'far: Meaning his book \"Jewels of Words\" (Jawahir al-Alfaz) - most likely - for it is specific to Eloquence.",

He was a scribe among the scribes of composition (Insha') in the days of Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Amir, and the greatest praiser of the Amirid state. When the command of that state ended in Cordoba, Ibn Darraj began moving around the cities of Andalusia praising its princes until he settled down with the ruler of Zaragoza, Mundhir bin Yahya, and lived in his care until he died. The critics of Andalusia advanced him and testified to his merit. Ibn Hazm said of him: \"If I said there was no one in Andalusia more poetic than Ibn Darraj, I would not be far [from truth].\" Muhammad bin Ibrahim al-Qaysi al-Washqi collected his Diwan alphabetically in the year 467, but it did not reach us.
