And there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner} (Fatir: 24). This continued until the final nation, the nation of the Arabs, who took polytheism as a religion, injustice as a method, and sins as a profession.

So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires away from what has come to you of the truth. For each [community] We have made a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He could have made you one community, but [He did so] to test you in what He has given you. So race toward good deeds. To Allah is your return altogether, and He will inform you regarding that in which you used to differ.”} (al-Mā’idah: 48)\n\nSince the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) is the Seal of the Messengers and his ummah—the Ummah of Invitation—is the most widespread in lands and the longest-lasting in time, it is inevitable that some of this ummah, indeed most of it, will fall into great distance from what pleases the Lord of the Worlds, Exalted is He. And because no prophet will come after him, it is from the bounty of Allah upon this ummah that He sends at the head of every hundred years someone who renews for it its religion.\n\nAbū Dāwūd—may Allah be pleased with him—reported in his Sunan, at the beginning of the Book of Malāḥim, with his chain from Abū Hurayrah—may Allah be pleased with them both—that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Indeed, Allah sends to this ummah at the head of every hundred years someone who renews for it its religion.”\n\nThose who are sent are the imams of the scholars—the inheritors of the prophets. They renew for this ummah the understanding of its religion, so that its religiosity is renewed and its righteous commitment in conduct according to what came to it from Allah in His Book and from the Prophet (ﷺ) in his purified Sunnah, in the manner that pleases Allah, Exalted is He.\n\nThis renewal by the scholars—the inheritors of the prophets—is, in fact, a renewal of understanding of the Book and the Sunnah, an understanding that motivates people toward sound religious commitment to the Book and the Sunnah, and nothing else.",

    "text": "Among the subtleties and marvels of the Prophetic statement is that he called what the scholars who are sent at the beginning of every hundred years do of renewal \"Deen\" (Religion), meaning religiosity (Tadayyun). In this is a Prophetic indication that what comes from scholars in understanding the religion (the text/the divine and prophetic address to the Ummah) is part of the religion (religiosity) and not something external to the Book and the Sunnah; rather, it is something emerging from them. For the scholar's Ijtihad (independent reasoning) in understanding the Book and the Sunnah according to the principles of correct understanding of them is part of the Book and the Sunnah. Therefore, the Ummah should not feel reassured by an Ijtihad unless it is from a scholar of the Book and the Sunnah and the methods of understanding them. And its reassurance in what comes from the assemblies of the people of knowledge should be stronger than its reassurance in what comes of oddities and unique opinions from individual Ijtihads. We are today in the context of collective Ijtihad, upon which a group of sincere specialized scholars cooperate and collaborate. For in their gathering, consultation, and mutual advice is a safety from stumbling, and from the temptation of a devil or the audacity of a ruler. Also in this is a Prophetic guidance for the Ummah that what scholars produce of Ijtihad in understanding and comprehending the Book and the Sunnah according to the principles of Fiqh (jurisprudence) and understanding from Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and from His Messenger, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, contains the goodness of this Ummah. And that it should accept this goodness and thank Allah, the Almighty, for raising among them those who renew for them their Fiqh and understanding of His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet, peace be upon him. Thus, from that renewal in Fiqh and understanding comes the renewal of religiosity through the Book and the Sunnah. In this is also a Prophetic guidance for the Ummah to observe the rights of the scholars of the Book and the Sunnah who act upon them, so their honors and biographies are not attacked, and no corrupt speech is listened to that casts falsehood into the ears of the common people, wounding the images of the Ummah's scholars in the hearts of its children, causing them to turn away from them towards others who earn worldly gains by speaking about the Book of Allah, the Almighty, and the Sunnah of His Prophet, peace be upon him -",

    "text": "And in the sending at the beginning of every hundred years is an indication that Allah, the Almighty, out of the abundance of His mercy and compassion, did not leave this Ummah to reside in indulgence in sin and recklessness in distancing from obedience for a long time. Rather, He places in every generation of its generations someone who renews its religion for it, so the darkness does not accumulate upon it, making its extraction from that darkness not difficult. Because one who resides in the darkness of sin for a long time, it becomes not easy for the one who rises to extract him from it to accomplish what he rose for. This is from the overflow of divine aid to the heirs of the Prophet, peace be upon him. The renewer sent at the beginning of every [hundred] years is not necessarily one; rather, the sending can be of more than one in several fields. Hence, I count some of the people of knowledge in a single century and fields of understanding in the Book and the Sunnah, whom Allah, the Almighty, sent to renew for this Ummah its religion: understanding His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet, peace be upon him, in the ninth Hijri century, as renewers for this Ummah. Among them is \"Burhan al-Din al-Biqa'i\", the author of the exegesis \"Nazm al-Durar\" (The Arrangement of Pearls). He renewed for this Ummah the understanding of the Book of Allah, the Almighty. I desired to prepare this book about the life of his mind, the jihad of his pen, and the methodology of his interpretation of the rhetoric of the Holy Qur'an and publish it among the students of knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah. Hence, I made the book into two chapters: The first: His jihad in seeking knowledge and teaching it. The second chapter I dedicated to explaining his methodology in interpreting the rhetoric of the Holy Qur'an. I was keen to mention examples from his exegesis \"Nazm al-Durar\" because I see it as a landmark of his methodology in interpreting the Holy Qur'an, hoping that reading these examples would entice the reader to read in his exegesis itself, a reading of research and knowledge worthy of patience and perseverance.",

    "text": "In an age where a group proclaims that what sufficed the Companions in the era of Prophethood does not suffice them, and that we must reread the Holy Qur'an a modern reading that keeps pace with the movement of life in the age of (Globalization). So books multiplied with those readings whose primary concern is nothing but trivializing the interpretive heritage of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah and elevating the status of the philosophical interpretation of the Holy Qur'an, which was championed by a group of those attributed to scholars like \"Ibn Arabi\" and the interpretations of some of the Mu'tazila. Some of those engaged in knowledge strive to spread their rational methodology that elevates itself over the text and call for the text not being prioritized over reason; rather, reason stripped of subordination to the text has authority over the text, even if it is Mutawatir (mass-transmitted). Hence, we saw those who try unsuccessfully to apply foreign methodologies in literary criticism of texts to the Qur'anic discourse. And we saw those who proclaim among their students the necessity of studying the Holy Qur'an as a \"literary study\" and that any lesson of the Holy Qur'an that is not based on this literary study is a sterile lesson, and that literary study is based on stripping away the belief in the sanctity of the text during its study, so it becomes a subject of criticism like any text. Then, when the literary study of the text ends, one may return to establishing the sanctity of the Qur'anic text in his heart. Just like that, as if the sanctity of the Holy Qur'an and its establishment in the heart is a garment or less that the remover takes off when he wishes and puts on when he wishes. All this under the claim of scientific objectivity in scientific research, and much more than this with which the published newspapers among the people surge.",

    "text": "And perhaps I will soon publish, God willing, among students of knowledge, a book dedicated to clarifying the controls of understanding meaning from the Book and the Sunnah. I have finished, praise be to Allah, the Almighty, preparing its first draft, and I ask Allah, the Almighty, for help in revising and finalizing it. Perhaps there will be help in it for those searching for the truth to gain insight, and perhaps I will demolish some of what the corrupters are building of a mosque of harm (Masjid Dirar), so I would be striving to perform some of what is obligatory upon us of advice (Naseehah) towards the Book of Allah, the Majestic. Imam \"Muslim\", may Allah be pleased with him, narrated in his Sahih in the Book of Faith with his chain of transmission from \"Tamim al-Dari\", may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, said: \"The religion is advice (Naseehah). We said: To whom? He said: \"To Allah, His Book, His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.\" If every student of knowledge and those engaged in it placed that noble Hadith before their eyes, and remembered that the field of Jihad with the word of truth and standing guard (Ribat) in verifying scientific facts in the chapter of creed and Sharia is a vast door of Jihad in the path of Allah, the Almighty, they would find sweet whatever trials and tribulations they encounter in that path. And Allah, the Almighty, has said to us: {And We have made some of you as a trial for others - will you have patience? And your Lord is ever Seeing} (Al-Furqan: from verse 20)",

    "text": "Indeed, among the most severe trials that destroy not a few students of knowledge in our time is the trial of those in authority and power elevating the status of the people of debauchery and disobedience, bringing them close, appointing them to many of the affairs of the country and the people, and lavishing money and forms of honoring upon them, while distancing the people of knowledge and piety and neglecting to honor them if they do good. So, young students of knowledge thought that this justifies for them turning away from striving in the chapter of knowledge and standing guard at the frontiers of Da'wah and enlightening hearts with the meanings of guidance from the Book and the Sunnah. And [they thought] there is in this a justification for them to throw themselves into the embraces of the brothers of devils and increasing the numbers of those who loose and bind (decision-makers) in the affairs of the country. So they hastened to the doors of everyone with authority and turned away from the doors of inheriting from the Master of Messengers, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace. Indeed, what befits every caller to Allah, the Almighty, who strives with the word of truth, is the companionship of Surah \"Al-Ankabut\" (The Spider) in recitation, understanding, and adopting the character of the meanings of guidance to the Straight Path contained therein. It is a Surah dedicated to inciting striving in enjoining good and forbidding evil, and confronting the falsehood of the people of the world. For in their falsehood, even if they appear strong and fortified in apparent view, they are in reality protecting themselves with what is flimsier than a spider's web; none falls into it except he who is deceived by it. As for the people of insight, they are capable of uprooting it. {Alif, Lam, Meem * Do the people think that they will be left to say, \"We believe\" and they will not be tried? * But We have certainly tried those before them, and Allah will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely make evident the liars} (Al-Ankabut: 1-3) {And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good} (Al-Ankabut: 69)",

    "text": "So look wisely at the beginning of the recitation from that Surah and its end, for in it is what every caller to Allah, the Almighty – and every Muslim is a caller by the tongue of his state – needs to stand for a long time in understanding and comprehending the meanings of guidance to the Straight Path hidden within it. If you add to that the understanding and comprehension of the meanings of guidance in Surah (An-Nahl), you will have from that a generous provision that does not perish, and whose wonders and delights do not end. Indeed, what benefits the student of knowledge and helps him, by the permission of Allah, the Almighty, is the good reading of the lives of the Imams among the scholars of the Book and the Sunnah, especially in eras of tyranny and the abundance of worldly enjoyment. For in every era of those eras, there are Imams scholars who bit onto guidance with their molar teeth and held fast to guidance, and did not cast their foreheads under the shoes of those in authority, but rather spoke the word of truth and lit the lamps of guidance in the darkness of falsehood. Indeed, it is upon us to present the lives of those scholars standing tall in the face of tyranny, patient in supporting the truth and patient against the temptation of money, authority, and prestige scattered from under the feet of Satan. O Allah, I ask You by my bearing witness that there is no god but You, the One, the Eternal Refuge, who begets not nor was born, and there is none co-equal or comparable to Him, to send blessings, peace, and blessings upon Your servant, Prophet, and Messenger Muhammad bin Abdullah, and upon his family, wives, companions, and his heirs among the people of knowledge in every glance and breath, the number of Your creation, the satisfaction of Your Self, the weight of Your Throne, and the ink of Your words.

He taught me - may Allah honor him - that this is a major door among the doors of saving the Ummah from the clutches of ignorance and humiliation. He - may Allah elevate his mention with the Holy Qur'an in both abodes - had and still has a penetrating influence on many students of Arabic knowledge.

Indeed, when Allah, the Almighty, made His servant our Master Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, the Seal of the Prophets and Messengers, and made his religion: Islam, the seal of religions, and for all people: {And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. But most of the people do not know} (Saba: 28). And since people are in need of someone to take their hands to the Straight Path: {The path of Allah, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Unquestionably, to Allah do [all] matters evolve} (Ash-Shura: 53), He made that the mission of the scholars after him, peace be upon him. So they were the stars of the Ummah as he, peace be upon him, informed in what \"Ahmad\", may Allah be pleased with them, narrated in his Musnad from \"Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with them:\" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, said: \"The likeness of the scholars on earth is like the stars in the sky by which one is guided in the darkness of the land and sea. If the stars are obliterated, the guides are on the verge of going astray\" (Musnad Ahmad vol. 3 p. 157). And He made them the heirs of the Prophets: \"Ahmad\", may Allah be pleased with them, narrated in his Musnad from \"Abu Darda, may Allah be pleased with them\" that he heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: \"... Indeed, the scholars are the heirs of the Prophets. They did not inherit a Dinar nor a Dirham, but rather they inherited knowledge. So whoever takes it has taken an abundant share\" (Musnad Ahmad: 5/196). According to the amount of a person's intellect is the amount of his striving to take from the inheritance of Prophethood in word and deed. So there were many in the Ummah in the past who strove to take from the inheritance of Prophethood; to undertake the clarification of the Straight Path in everything that arises from the renewed movement of life.",

    "text": "And indeed, what also entices one to be keen on being a person of knowledge is standing upon the glorious biography of scholars, especially those who approached seeking it seeking reward with an open heart. They did not adopt in seeking it the methodology of repeating what came from their predecessors, but rather adopted a critical methodology that invests in high and noble speech and adds to it; because of what came in the majestic Prophetic wisdom: \"At-Tirmidhi\", may Allah be pleased with them, narrated with his chain from Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with them, who said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, said: \"Do not be a blind follower (Imma'ah), saying: If the people do good, we do good, and if they do injustice, we do injustice. But discipline yourselves: if the people do good, you do good, and if they do evil, you do not do injustice\" (Sahih Al-Tirmidhi: Book: Righteousness - Hadith: 2007). Scholars are the most capable of the Ummah to discipline themselves with this tempting Prophetic wisdom towards a critical methodology for everything that the movement of life brings. It is a methodology that no one is capable of except one who has a good origin and pasture, a lofty goal, seeing the world as it is with its Creator, so he does not place it in his heart above its reality. Thus, he wonders at one who tempts a scholar with it, when his Lord, the Almighty, has made him an heir of Prophethood, not an heir of a kingdom that vanishes. And he wonders even more at one who affiliates himself with the people of knowledge and looks up to what the hand of the ruler waves of the scraps of the world. And \"Burhan al-Din al-Biqa'i\" is, as I reckon - and I do not purify anyone before Allah, the Almighty - one of those scholars striving in seeking knowledge, teaching it, and publishing his beneficial books in the Ummah. He presented to his Ummah many books of beneficial knowledge, so I desired to inform the students of knowledge about something of his struggle.",

    "text": "Chapter One: His Jihad in Seeking Knowledge and Teaching It. The Origin and Pasture.. At the beginning of the ninth Hijri century and in the land of Sham, there was the arrival of a man who would have, with the revolutionizing and pondering of the Holy Qur'an, a methodology that would raise his mention among his peers in his era, then in the successive eras after him, and make his mention prominent among those standing to ponder the generous Qur'anic statement. They are many before him and after him, their number hardly countable, but he will have the privilege of being a head in one of the methodologies of rhetorical pondering of the Holy Qur'an. Even if he was not the founder of that methodology, he is the one raising its bases, standing guard at its frontier defending it, and completing its structure. That one coming from the land of Beqaa, attributed to it, so he placed it on the tongues of many people of knowledge, thus being dutiful to its mention: \"Ibrahim bin Umar bin Hasan al-Rubat bin Ali bin Abi Bakr\" \"Abu al-Hasan Burhan al-Din al-Biqa'i\". His lineage ends - as he mentions - with our master \"Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas al-Zuhri\", may Allah be pleased with them (1).",

    "text": "His birth was in the village of \"Khirbat Roha\" in the Beqaa al-Azizi in the land of Sham in the year eight hundred and nine of the Hijra. This date was transmitted from him by those who chronicled him (1). He remained alive in this world for seventy-six years, suffering from hardship and grief what he suffered, until he departed to his Lord, the Almighty, on the night of Saturday, the eighth of the month of Rajab in the year eight hundred and eighty-five (885) in Damascus and was buried on Saturday in the Hamidiyya cemetery towards the grave of \"Atika\" in Damascus (2). *** His Creed and Jurisprudential School: In the chapter of creed, \"Al-Biqa'i\" was on the methodology of the Ash'aris, and in the jurisprudence of Sharia on the methodology of Imam Al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him. He did not suffice with that but studied the Maliki school under his Sheikh \"Al-Mashdali\" at Al-Azhar Al-Sharif, and studied \"Al-Muwatta\" under his Sheikh Muhammad bin Ali al-Safawi\" in Cairo in the year eight hundred and thirty-seven (3). Combining two schools of jurisprudence in study after mastering one of them is an aid to broad intellectual vision and penetrating insight. The difference in schools of jurisprudence is based on a difference in the methodology of insight into the texts of the Book and Sunnah on one hand, and insight into the movement of life and the civilizational context in which the owner of the school and its student stand. A jurist is not one who devotes himself to memorizing the opinions of the people of knowledge and his chest contains what they wrote in their papers and books while isolating himself from the movement of his people's life and the context of their temporal and spatial existence. If the Sharia of Islam is valid for every time and place as is famous, it is also reforming for every time and place. There is no era or city where corruption prevailed and it surrendered its affair to the Sharia of Islam as a patient surrenders his affair to his doctor, except that it was healed and its glory, honor, and security returned to it. Indeed, upon the jurists of the Ummah in this era of ours and the eras following it is a necessary obligation that no individual among their group can perform alone:",

The good lies in leaving for the people - especially the common folk - a wide space of the permissible and of what the verified pious scholars' investigations have not unanimously agreed upon its prohibition. For the temptations of life are stronger than the pillars of faith in the hearts of not a few people. If words of prohibition not definitively indicated by texts pour into their ears regarding everything they ask about, the ways of escape are many. Let our jurists be Rabbani (godly), and such will not be realized if their sights and insights are confined to what the four schools of jurisprudence brought. In the heritage of our scholars before those four Imams, with them, and after them, are Ijtihads of Imams and scholars who are no less in status in their knowledge, Ijtihad, and advice to Allah, the Almighty, His Book, His Messenger, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, and the Muslim leaders and their common folk, seeking the pleasure of their Lord, glory be to Him. It is worthy of us to revive the study of their heritage and benefit from the principles of consideration they had. *** His Scientific Journeys: The First Stage: (809 - 835). When Al-Biqa'i reached the age of discernment, he received several sciences in his village \"Khirbat Roha\". He read the Holy Qur'an to his uncle Al-Shihab Al-Biqa'i (770-820) and memorized it. He attended the Zawiya of Sheikh \"Musa\" to review his memorization of the Holy Qur'an, and led prayers with it (1).",

Then a calamity befell his people in the twenty-first year of the ninth century (821), while the boy was in the twelfth year of his life. The calamity claimed a group of his family: his father, his two uncles, and six others. So he leaves his village with his mother and grandfather, moving through several villages: entering the villages of Wadi al-Taym and al-Arqub, remaining there until he entered Damascus\" in the year (823). He becomes active in seeking knowledge: studying Al-Shatibiyyah up to Surah Al-Munafiqun under his Sheikh \"Sharaf al-Din al-Masharati\" (d. 825) (1). He reads grammar, morphology, jurisprudence, and rational sciences under his favorite Sheikh \"Muhammad bin Bahadur\" (d. 831) and sticks to him (2). He receives logic from Sheikh \"Al-Badr Al-Hindi\" (d. 833), student of Al-Sayyid Al-Sharif (d. 816). The Sheikh admires him and promises to teach him \"the science of geometry,\" but \"Al-Badr\" left Damascus for \"Hama\" before he could fulfill his promise (3). In the year (828), he studies the ten readings under Al-Shams bin Al-Jazari (d. 833), memorizes \"Al-Nashr fi al-Qira'at al-Ashr\", and he grants him license (Ijazah) for everything permissible for the Sheikh (4). He travels to \"Jerusalem\" for the first time with his mother, studying there \"the science of arithmetic\" under his Sheikh \"Al-Imad bin Sharaf\" (d. 852). He memorizes the two poems of \"Ibn Al-Ha'im\" in algebra and the rules of inflection, presenting them to his Sheikh \"Al-Imad\", who admires him and entitles him Sheikh, Imam, and the Proficient Reciter (5).",

He completes the authorship of his book: \"Kifayat al-Qari wa Ghunyat al-Muqri fi Riwayat Abi Amr\" (1).

Thus ends one stage of his stages of receiving knowledge, to begin another stage where he combines receiving knowledge from its luminaries and teaching students of knowledge what he received, keen on being the learner-teacher. That is the way of the intelligent person among those affiliated with this Muhammadan nation in goal and method. For there is no good in a day in which a person does not learn beneficial knowledge, nor teach a Muslim what benefits him, whether by the tongue of his speech or pen, or by the tongue of his state, deeds, and morals. ***** The Second Stage: (835 - 880). In this stage, he took Cairo as a home and homeland, and undertook some travels inside the Egyptian lands and outside them. He used to reside in Cairo above a mosque in \"Rahbat Bab al-Eid\", which is a wide square that was in front of the eastern gate of the Great Fatimid Palace built by \"Jawhar al-Siqilli\" for Al-Mu'izz Al-Fatimi. It is now branching from Qasr al-Shawq Street in Al-Ghouriya at Al-Azhar, and \"Rahbat Bab al-Eid\" Street still exists and is populated. \"Al-Biqa'i\" assumed the function of \"Mu'id\" (Repetitor) in this mosque and in the \"Al-Zahir\" mosque. It is a function whose holder undertakes making some students understand what they could not understand from the Sheikh, repeating the lesson to them with some clarification as Al-Taj Al-Subki says in \"Mu'id al-Ni'am\".",

For its neighbors are in dire need for the light of beneficial knowledge to shine upon them from it. It is not sufficient for it to be an Islamic monument viewed by non-Muslims while the sons of Islam do not benefit from it with anything other than performing the obligatory prayers, then the doors are closed in their faces. Mosques in Islam are not only for performing prayers, but they are likewise institutes of education, assemblies of consultation, and homes of mercy and connection. However, the people, fearing for the chairs of their emirates, trembled with fear that the youth would meet under the care of a scholar reciting the Book of Allah, glory be to Him, and studying it among themselves. So the mosques were closed outside the times of obligatory prayers, and brothels were opened at all times and for whoever desired. Al-Biqa'i remained attached to his Sheikh \"Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani\" in his residence and travels until the death of \"Ibn Hajar\" (d. 852). \"Al-Biqa'i\" was active in authorship during this stage. Among his travels with \"Ibn Hajar\" was his trip to Sham in the year (836) in the company of Sultan \"Barsbay\". There he reads with some Sheikhs of Sham like Al-Burhan Al-Tarabulsi, \"Ibn Sheikh al-Souq al-Hanbali\", \"Ibn al-Adim\", and Al-Shihab Al-Ramli\". He sought to meet the poet \"Ibn Hijjah al-Hamawi\", but it was not facilitated for him (1). In the year (837), he returns with his Sheikh \"Ibn Hajar\" to Cairo, so he increases reading with its scholars: He reads with \"Al-Maqrizi\" the historian some of his works, and with \"Al-Mashdali\" exegesis and Maliki jurisprudence, learning from him the general rule for the proportionality of the verses and Surahs of the Holy Qur'an, and establishes on its basis his great exegesis: \"Nazm al-Durar\". He reads with \"Al-Badr Al-Busiri\", and with \"Ibn al-Safawi\". He reads grammar, rhetoric, Tafsir al-Kashshaf, logic, jurisprudence, and its principles with \"Al-Qayati\".

Numerous severe events and tribulations happened to him in Egypt due to his confronting what he saw as evil that is not permissible to remain silent about, so he leaves it for \"Damascus\" (2).

A group of scholars showed bias against him because of verses he said in his poem \"Al-Ta'iyyah\". They objected to him regarding that, and explicitly declared his debauchery, even his disbelief, and attributed him to those who say incarnation (Hulul) and union (Ittihad). Far be it from him to be attributed this meaning, but the understandings of a group of scholars of this age fell short, and they did not understand the meaning of Sheikh \"Umar's\" saying in what he intended by these verses. So they took them literally and did not direct a meaning for them. It was as Al-Mutanabbi said: 'How many fault a correct statement * And its bane is from the sickly understanding.' 'But minds take from it * According to the capacities and understandings.' The head of those who showed bias against Sheikh \"Umar bin al-Farid\" was: \"Burhan al-Din al-Biqa'i\", and the Chief Judge: \"Muhibb al-Din bin al-Shihna\", and a large group of students of knowledge followed them saying he was a debauchee. As for those who showed bias for Ibn al-Farid among the scholars, they were: Sheikh Muhyi al-Din al-Kafiyaji al-Hanafi, and Sheikh al-Qasim al-Hanafi.... When the agitation increased in this issue, fatwas were written regarding the matter of \"Ibn al-Farid\" whose appearance is departure from the rules of Sharia. So Sheikh Muhyi al-Din al-Kafiyaji wrote on this question what is the best expression and closest to justice 0. And Al-Jalal Al-Suyuti composed a book on that naming it: \"Qam' al-Mu'arid fi al-Radd 'an Ibn al-Farid\" (Suppressing the Opposer in Defending Ibn al-Farid). And \"Al-Badri bin al-Fars\" composed a healing book on this meaning clear in refuting those who objected to \"Ibn al-Farid\". And some scholars authored a book naming it: \"Diryaq al-Afa'i fi al-Radd 'ala al-Biqa'i\" (The Antidote of Snakes in Refuting Al-Biqa'i). Contentions occurred in this issue among the scholars which would take long to explain in this meaning. Then they satirized \"Al-Biqa'i\" and \"Ibn al-Shihna\" and others who showed bias against \"Ibn al-Farid\" and began writing papers satirizing the objectors to \"Ibn al-Farid\" and sticking those papers on his shrine....",

As for \"Al-Biqa'i\", the common people almost killed him, and he received from the Emirs what had no good in it, so he fled and hid.....\" (1). \"Al-Biqa'i\" stood guard struggling against the aggression of the people of falsehood upon the purity of the doctrine of Tawheed. So there was nothing left but to migrate from Egypt to \"Damascus\". This which \"Al-Biqa'i\" undertook is an obligation upon the people of knowledge to undertake the like of in every age and city. For if the people of falsehood know that their proclaiming of falsehood will meet eloquent hardship from the people of truth, they will not proclaim their falsehood. Falsehood will not appear except from the weakness of the people of truth, their silence, and their leniency in repelling what arises of evidences of falsehood. For falsehood and its people are too weak to triumph by themselves; their victory is only from the weakness of their enemies, the people of truth. This stage of \"Al-Biqa'i's\" life is the richest stage of his life in learning, teaching, and authorship, and in acquiring many scientific and social skills. I think this stage is what resulted in him becoming one of those whose heritage a serious student of the sciences of the Holy Qur'an cannot dispense with. He is distinguished in this over his peers like Al-Sakhawi in that what he presented of scientific heritage cannot be replaced by others, especially his majestic exegesis: \"Nazm al-Durar fi al-Ayat wa al-Suwar\". As for Al-Sakhawi, although he presented what he is praised for, there is in what others presented what suffices from it.",

Al-Biqa'i has in his exegesis at least very much of what you hardly find with a predecessor or contemporary to him. For his scientific personality stands in his exegesis traversing it and cutting across it lengthwise and breadthwise, so his tone and breath hardly disappear from you. That is the affair of the glorious scholar. Hence, I claim that he and his Sheikh \"Ibn Hajar\" are among the renewers in the ninth Hijri century. ***** The Third Stage: From the year 880-885. This stage begins with his departure from Cairo to Damascus, and ends with his departure to his Lord, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. In Damascus, \"Ibn Qadi Ajlun\" (d. 928) and his students receive him and exaggerate in honoring and revering him for what reached him of his knowledge. He remains in the generosity of Ibn Qadi Ajlun until a fitnah erupts known as the fitnah of (There is nothing in possibility more wondrous than what was), which is a philosophical proposition said by \"Al-Ghazali\". \"Al-Biqa'i\" confronts it, refutes the opinions of those who say it, and writes about this. \"Ibn Qadi Ajlun\" does not approve of this from him, out of partisanship for Al-Ghazali.",

And Al-Ghazali or anyone else besides the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, is not infallible such that some of what he brings cannot be rejected. So \"Ibn Qadi Ajlun\" and his students turn away from \"Al-Biqa'i\"; indeed, some people attack Al-Biqa'i because of that (1). He is tested in Cairo with the fitnah of Ibn Arabi and Ibn al-Farid, and tested in Damascus with the fitnah of: \"There is nothing in possibility more wondrous than what was\". But he does not submit except to the truth he sees with evidence from the Book and the Sunnah and believes in. During his stay in Damascus, he authors some of his books and treatises, edits, and produces the fair copy of his final version of his exegesis \"Nazm al-Durar\". He finishes this editing in the afternoon of Sunday, the tenth of Sha'ban in the year eight hundred and eighty-two at his house adjacent to the \"Badra'iyyah\" School in Damascus, meaning three years before his death (2). Seventy-six years Al-Biqa'i lived struggling, not softening, nor slackening, nor tiring. He knew the value of life and the greatness of what he was coming to of meeting his Lord, glory be to Him, and His questioning him about his life and in what he spent it. So he strove to prepare for this majestic question an answer with which he would not regret nor be disgraced. If every one of us occupied himself with searching for a praiseworthy answer to this divine question to him on the Day of Resurrection, you would not find a Muslim reckless in killing his leisure times, nor consuming his life in what leaves him nothing praiseworthy and glorious upon departing to his destiny.",

    "text": "What remains for Al-Biqa'i – God willing, and I do not purify anyone before Allah, the Almighty – is his struggle in establishing a majestic methodology for interpreting the Qur'anic statement, an interpretation that guides to knowledge of some features of the Great Qur'anic Inimitability, and guides to knowledge of some subtleties of the truths of the meanings of guidance to the Straight Path. So one ascends with this knowledge in the stations of proximity to the Lord of the worlds, and moves in the teeth of obedience from the start of faith (those who believe) to its end (the believers), and from it to the start of piety (those who fear Allah) then to its end (the pious), to enter after that into the tooth of Ihsan (those who do good), worshipping Allah, the Almighty, certain that Allah, the Almighty, sees him so he does not turn to other than Him, then to the end of Ihsan (the doers of good), worshipping Allah, glory be to Him, as if he sees his Lord, the Almighty, tasting the sweetness of proximity and intimacy with obedience to the Lord of the worlds. ******* His Sheikhs and Students: It is not hidden that the working scholar is indeed an heir of the Prophet, peace be upon him, an inheritance of upbringing and education {Be Rabbaniyyin (pious scholars) because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied} (Al Imran: from verse 79). And every intelligent noble student of knowledge is but the fruit of a sincere effort of a Sheikh or Sheikhs sincere in their teaching and upbringing. This entices every parent to be keen on placing his child before a Sheikh who instills in the student's heart the love of beneficial knowledge and acting upon it, and its elevation over every enjoyment of the worldly life. That is more worthy of keenness to realize for his child than his keenness to realize for him fleeting enjoyment and false prestige. Our righteous predecessors did not throw their children before everyone who threw himself into the field of education. For how many an educator is in more need of being educated, and how many a teacher is in more need of someone to teach him, especially in this time of ours where not a few of those engaged in education are the great danger to the morals of the youth.",

They repeat to their hearing what contradicts the explicit Book and Sunnah without mentioning to them what came in the Book and Sunnah contradicting their teachings so that some of those children or parents do not feel embarrassed. So children grew up in the Ummah for whom the evil (Munkar) religiously is with them the good (Ma'ruf), and the good religiously is the evil from which they flee as they flee from everything hateful to them. If a nation reaches the point where evil transforms in it into good that is sought eagerly and boasted about, and the rulers, those affiliated with knowledge, its students, and the common people respect its people for it, and the general public believes that this is from the opening of Allah, glory be to Him, upon its owner and His honoring of him, then that nation has approached the edge of a crumbling cliff that may collapse with it into the fire of Hell, and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. Saving this nation at that time is very difficult, but it is not impossible, which imposes upon its scholars struggle and perseverance, and mutual advice with truth, patience, and mercy. Indeed, upon us – we fathers – is to choose well the places of our children's education and choose their Sheikhs, and to teach them that the message of the Sheikh is from the message of the Prophet: good advice seeking reward. There is no deed at all that is descended from the deed of Prophethood like the deed of teaching people good. Hence, its reward was great: Al-Tirmidhi narrated with his chain from \"Abu Umamah Al-Bahili\", may Allah be pleased with them, that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, said:",

The countries where he met scholars the most were Cairo then Damascus. He was not on an equal level in his reception from those scholars, nor was he attached to many of them with the attachment of studentship. Perhaps the most attached to him were his Sheikh Ibn Bahadur, and his Sheikh Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani. I am not here to classify them in terms of the sciences he received from them, for he used to receive a single science from more than one scholar in more than one country; indeed, he used to receive a single book from more than one Sheikh. The dictionary of his Sheikhs and peers overflows with the mention of his Sheikhs and what he received from them and his conditions with them, and with the mention of his peers. It is a vast dictionary that filled four manuscript volumes. I desired to suffice here with transferring Al-Biqa'i's biography of some of them from his manuscript dictionary to be a model of his methodology on one hand and biographies of his Sheikhs and students on the other, but I did not succeed in that. Transferring that from his manuscript dictionary completely was difficult for me due to lack of time and effort and numerous preoccupations, especially since many of his Sheikhs are luminaries whose biographies are presented in several references. I saw fit to arrange some of his Sheikhs according to the date of their death, and to summarize the biography by pointing to them and the sources of their biographies: Sharaf al-Din al-Masharati: Sadaqah bin Salamah bin Husayn bin Badran bin Ibrahim al-Jayduri (760-825). Al-Masharati with a Fatha on Meem, Sukun on Seen, and Fatha on Ha is attributed to the village of Mashara from the works of \"Al-Jaydur\" a stage away from Damascus. He had extreme care for readings, and the Sheikhdom of recitation in Damascus ended up with him. He taught readings in the Umayyad Mosque. Crowds in Damascus benefited from him, and most of its Sheikhs graduated through him. Al-Biqa'i read \"Al-Shatibiyyah\" with him and recited the Glorious Qur'an well with him up to Surah \"Al-Munafiqun\".",

Al-Ala' Al-Bukhari was biased against the Hanbalis and exaggerated in attacking \"Ibn Taymiyyah\" may Allah be pleased with them, explicitly declaring his disbelief. A group showed bias for Ibn Taymiyyah, and a collection of scholars in Egypt did not support Al-Ala' Al-Bukhari in unleashing his tongue against Ibn Taymiyyah. The Sultan issued a decree that no one should object to another's school, so the fitnah subsided (2). ***** Al-Shihab Al-Ramli: Abu al-Abbas Ahmad bin Husayn bin Arslan al-Maqdisi al-Shafi'i, known as: Ibn Arslan (773-844).",

And much more. He was known for righteousness, asceticism, and many acts of obedience. \"His son-in-law \"Al-Hafiz Al-Taj bin Al-Gharabili\" recounted about him that he slept little at night, and that at the time of his waking he would rise standing like a lion; perhaps his standing preceded the completion of his waking up. He would stand as if terrified, perform ablution, and stand before his Lord, the Almighty, conversing with Him with His speech with contemplation and pondering. If the meaning of a verse confused him, he would hurry in those two Rak'ahs, look in the exegesis until he knew the meaning, then return to prayer.\" In summary, he is among those who became famous for knowledge and asceticism, so students of knowledge sought him and benefited from him (1). ***** Taqi al-Din Al-Maqrizi: Ahmad bin Ali bin Abd al-Qadir bin Muhammad al-Hanafi al-Shafi'i \"Sibt Ibn al-Sa'igh\" attributed to \"Al-Maqarizah\" which is a neighborhood in \"Baalbek\".

So Ibn Hajar was the Sheikh pointed to in this. He traveled in search of knowledge like many students of his time, traveling to Mecca, Yemen, Hijaz, and Sham.

He wrote a commendation for his student \"Al-Biqa'i\" on his interpretation (1). Indeed, the sheikhs of \"Al-Biqa'i\" are very numerous, and space does not allow for mentioning their names. His book *Unwan al-Zaman fi Tarajim al-Shuyukh wa al-Aqran* overflows with the biographies of many of them, Al-Biqa'i's relationship with them, the sciences he received from them, the books he read to them, the types of those readings, and the licenses (Ijazahs) they granted him and the types of those licenses. - - - His Students: If the sheikhs are among the most important sources that flow into the stream of \"Al-Biqa'i\", shaping his scientific personality from what he received from this multi-sourced spring, I argue that a brilliant student can be a tributary increasing the sea of his sheikh's knowledge. He draws his sheikh's attention to things his sheikh's care had not turned to. How often has a question from a brilliant student to his sheikh been the cause of a scientific work undertaken by the sheikh, thereby benefiting science and its people? Al-Biqa'i had students who sat with him, especially since his name became widespread in conjunction with his interpretation, unique in its methodology and goals. Among his students were those who took him as a primary sheikh, and those who took some of his knowledge. What I have found regarding his students is not equal to the amount of his sheikhs. It is clear that he held the position of repetitor (Mu'id) in the mosque of \"Rahbat Bab al-Eid\", and in the mosque of \"Al-Zahir\", known now as the neighborhood of \"Al-Zahir\" in Cairo. He undertook the teaching of the Holy Quran and Qira'at in the Mu'ayyad School. His sheikh \"Ibn Hajar\" appointed him as a reciter of Sahih al-Bukhari in the Citadel during the reign of Sultan \"Jaqmaq\", and he assumed the sheikhdom of reciters in the tomb of Umm al-Malik al-Salih. The important point is that he had students who became people of knowledge after him, teaching people what they had learned. \"Ibn Hajar al-Haytami\" (d. 974) says:",

Among his most famous students are: Al-Shihab al-Dimyati: Ahmad ibn Ali ibn Husayn ibn Ali al-Ashmuni (d. 840-890). He learned from Al-Shihab al-Bayjuri, Al-Alam al-Bulqini, and Al-Burhan al-Ajluni, and from Al-Biqa'i.

He held the sheikhdom of recitation at the Umayyad Mosque, Dar al-Hadith al-Ashrafiyyah, the Ashrafiyyah Tomb, and the Tomb of Umm Salih after his sheikh Al-Biqa'i. He became the Sheikh of Reciters in Damascus after him (1). Al-Shams al-Dalaji: Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Dalaji al-Shafi'i (860-947). He cared for jurisprudence and Hadith. Among his works are: *Sharh 'ala al-Khazrajiyyah*, *Sharh 'ala al-Arba'in al-Nawawiyyah*, *Sharh 'ala al-Shifa* by Qadi Iyad. He summarized *Al-Minhaj* and *Al-Maqasid*, naming it *Maqasid al-Maqasid*, and explained this summary (2). Ibn Hajar al-Haytami says about him: \"He was given, in Sharia and rational sciences, a robustness of composition and strength of phrasing that no one of his time was given.\" He also says about him: \"He authored works in the art of jurisprudence that rival the works of Al-Sa'd al-Taftazani and others in rhetoric, beauty of phrasing, and quality of structures, but no one cared for them, nor turned to them; rather, people turned away from them with extreme avoidance.\" Ibn Hajar al-Haytami explains this by saying: \"Because this Sheikh did not believe in 'Ibn Arabi', the author of *Al-Futuhat al-Makkiyyah*, like his sheikh 'Al-Biqa'i', so he was punished by the removal of blessing from his writings\" (3). This is misguidance and misleading from Al-Haytami, as if belief in \"Ibn Arabi\" is the key to benefiting from him. This is not said by a fair person nor accepted by a rational one. The standard for benefiting from knowledge is sincerity to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, in it. And what does \"Al-Haytami\" say about \"Ibn Taymiyyah\" and \"Ibn al-Qayyim\"? Is there no benefit in the knowledge they left behind? Or were they among those who believed in \"Ibn Arabi\", about whom I believe that he himself did not believe in himself, for he knew his own state better than others? No rational person reads anything from the book *Fusus al-Hikam* and retains in his chest a trace of belief that its writer is correct in what he blackened the pages of the book with, and his own pages as well. ***",

    "text": "Al-Jalal al-Suyuti: Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr ibn Uthman ibn Muhammad al-Khudayri al-Suyuti (849-911). One of the most famous scholars of his time, he excelled in many sciences and arts. He wrote his own biography in his book *Husn al-Muhadarah*. He received knowledge from the scholars of his time, including Al-Biqa'i (1). There were criticisms between him and Al-Biqa'i that exceeded the limit of moral tolerance between people of knowledge and between a sheikh and his student. The students of every scholar are the carriers of his knowledge and the methodology of his life, and they are more dutiful to him than the child who came from his loins. The scholar who is worthy of having the ink of his pen be purer than the scent of musk on the Day of Resurrection is the one who is capable of transforming the lives of his students first, and his nation after them, from a level of the levels of proximity to what is higher than it, and to transform their lives into what establishes them in the station of enjoying the pursuit of knowledge, learning and teaching, and disciplining and adopting morals; so that they may one day be the heirs of prophecy. Formatting one student who carries the methodology of his life from the sheikh is equal to the world and what is in it. The true scholar is not keen on teaching his students how to memorize knowledge in their hearts like the memorization of books and papers; rather, the scholar is the one who teaches his students the methodology of thinking, analyzing, evaluating, selecting, and investing. If we taught our students in our universities - at least - how to think, analyze, evaluate, and select, we would have a different status. He makes his students stand before human knowledge, whatever its human source, with an open heart that does not take a stance of sanctification or desecration towards things before probing, analyzing, and evaluating. An open heart is the sign of its owner's life, and whoever closes his heart to human knowledge has closed the doors of life in his face, for knowledge is the lost property of the believer, and the value of the 'Other' to him is to the extent that the 'Other' does well.",

    "text": "Chapter Two: Jihad of the Pen - His Scientific Works. A scholar is not beneficial to his people if he does not have his praiseworthy standing before his students in lecture halls, discussion, and dialogue, forming and shaping their scientific personalities, enticing them to enjoy seeking knowledge and adopting his noble morals and attributes. And if he does not have his praiseworthy standing as a caller to Allah Almighty through his good character and great asceticism regarding what is unbecoming for an heir of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to aspire to, for it is an inheritance of knowledge, character, and obedience to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. He - meaning the scholar - does not limit his generosity and noble giving to students of knowledge in his time and city; rather, he is the one who is extremely keen that the table of his knowledge be set and full of hospitality for every student of knowledge in every era and city. If his body is absent from them, his mind, heart, and literature remain in his books which his right hand writes, for which his reward with Allah Almighty on the Day of Resurrection will be that their ink transforms to be purer than musk in scent. That is a reward of the same nature as the deed, for that ink was a cause for changing people's lives through the beneficial knowledge it spread to what is higher and purer, so the reward was its transformation into what is better than musk on the Day of Resurrection. The soul of the scholar finds the scent of ink more pleasant than others find the scent of musk in this world. Preparing research, writing books, and publishing them among students of knowledge is a majestic responsibility. It is not fitting for a scholar who possesses the ability to fulfill some of its rights to turn away from it or distract himself with a fleeting matter of worldly life. The darkness of ignorance and atheism will not envelop our lands as long as there remain among us scholars who teach, educate, research, and write, and students of knowledge who strive to acquire knowledge, understand it, and invest it to cultivate the land and the hearts of the servants. That was the case with \"Al-Biqa'i\". He presented to students of knowledge and the Islamic library more than sixty books and treatises. Some of his works reached several volumes, and some of his treatises were handwritten leaflets which, if their summary were detailed, would reach a huge volume. Eyes turned away from many of his works for a long time, and many people barely heard his name until less than three decades ago. Indeed, he was not known as an exegete except by a few of those occupied with the sciences of the Book, the Sunnah, and Arabic.",

Allah Almighty has facilitated for me the viewing of many of his books while they were manuscripts nearly a quarter of a century ago. I have divided the discussion here on his works into two sections according to my relationship with them: The First Section: For what I found and read, and this I have arranged according to its arts. The Second Section: For what I trusted in its attribution to him, but I was not successful in viewing, either because it is still a manuscript deposited in treasuries outside Egypt and I could not afford to go to them due to lack of funds, or because they are missing with no known location. This I arranged alphabetically according to its title, and I took care to document its attribution to Al-Biqa'i, and to clarify something of what I trusted regarding the subject in which it was written. Perhaps Allah Almighty will help me to work on publishing what benefits the servants from them, seeking His pleasure and drawing near to Him and showing love. The First Section: What I viewed of his works. First: Exegesis and Sciences of the Holy Quran: The requirement of what I adopted was to arrange the books of this art according to their title alphabetically, but I deviated here to start with his interpretation because of its high status in his soul and its majestic status regarding the arts of scientific research I am concerned with, and because it is the basis of \"Al-Biqa'i's\" fame among the Imams, for his interpretation is the main source for the high status Al-Biqa'i had in his time and subsequent eras. {Nazm al-Durar min Tanasub al-Ay wa al-Suwar} I was not able to view the author's copy, but I viewed a part of a manuscript copy written in his time in the year (871) which the author corrected himself, while the rest of the copy is fabricated and incomplete.

He authored many books; Allah Almighty refused that anyone should benefit from them at all [sic]. He has a book on 'Correlations of the Quran' in about ten volumes, known only to the elite by hearsay, while others do not know it at all. Had this book belonged to our Sheikh 'Zakariyya' [meaning Zakariyya al-Ansari] or others among those who believe [meaning believe in the sainthood of 'Ibn Arabi' and 'Ibn al-Farid', and hold their views], it would have been written in gold; because no like of it [i.e., the interpretation of Correlations] has been created. But {To each [category] We extend - to these and to those - from the gift of your Lord. And never has the gift of your Lord been restricted} (Al-Isra: 20) (1). This statement from \"Ibn Hajar al-Haytami\" is closer to absenting the monotheistic Muslim mind than to anything else, for the landmarks of misleading are very apparent in it. If this is the state of those who believe in \"Ibn Arabi\", then this is proof that believing in his sainthood is clear misguidance. Who possesses the right to claim that believing in someone like \"Ibn Arabi\" is an obligation and obedience, such that whoever does not adhere to it is punished and expelled? What ignorance and misleading is this?!! The Islamic nation has been afflicted in later ages, and continues to be so, by many of those responsible for numbing and hypnotizing the Muslim mind which draws its nourishment and healing from the Book and the authentic Prophetic Sunnah. Not a few of those affiliated with knowledge and taking the lead in Dawah and teaching servants base their knowledge on myths, stories, and comic superstitions imagined for them by devils of mankind and jinn. Such people have the false dominance in the media; thus, such a situation allows every tyrant to spread corruption among his people and find no one to deter him and expose his tyranny and misleading of his people.",

He says: \"It is strange that the neglect of this aspect of important Quranic studies still exists and has not advanced a single step forward. Although government and private publishing institutions are diligent in publishing traditional books on interpretation, some of which suffice for the collection of them, they have closed their doors in the face of the first encyclopedic interpretation of its kind specialized in this type, which is 'Nazm al-Durar' by Al-Biqa'i. There is no excuse for these houses that they seek commercial popularity for books, for this book is in the first degree of popularity due to the lack of a peer for it among scholars, and due to its superior quality on the other hand. Nor is there an excuse for senior scholars in their ignorance of this book, for what we know is that it was permanently on the desk of Sheikh Al-Maraghi [meaning the Sheikh of Al-Azhar], and a senior scholar borrowed sentences from it to create an interpretation he attributed to himself. If withholding the book from printing was to make it a source for plagiarism, then what a miserable deed. And if withholding it with others was execution of a plan intended to keep Muslims in the clamor of boring repetition of the sciences of interpretation, then what a disappointing endeavor\" (1). Perhaps among the reasons for turning away from printing this interpretation is the difficulty of reading it, for its phrasing is interlaced, reaching the point of complexity. Not a few readers can barely endure continuing to read it. I have seen this from some students of knowledge, and even its teachers and sheikhs; they can hardly endure it, making the excuse that they did not find what they sought in it!!! They have overlooked [the truth], for what they seek from it - and he told me so - is hidden in the interpretation \"Nazm al-Durar\" in a manner you may not find a tenth of in others. This interpretation remained trapped in manuscript treasuries until some people of knowledge in the Indian lands were destined for it, so they set about verifying, printing, and publishing it in the Islamic lands:",

    "text": "That was from \"Da'irat al-Ma'arif al-Uthmaniyyah\" in Hyderabad, Deccan, India, a house that has great credit for publishing books of Islamic sciences. This is among the wonders of the Arab lands: people of culture there devote themselves to publishing the book *Al-Futuhat al-Makkiyyah*, the dreams of Al-Wahrani, the epistles of Ibn Sab'in, *Al-Aghani* by Al-Isfahani, the epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa, and the interpretation of Al-Tha'alibi..., while they are stingy towards something like \"Al-Biqa'i's\" interpretation, leaving students of knowledge in the Indian lands to spend on its verification and publication despite what they suffer. The interpretation was produced in twenty-two volumes of medium size (17x24 cm). The first volume was published in India in the year one thousand three hundred eighty-nine (1389) and the last in the year one thousand four hundred four (1404). Sheikh \"Muhammad ibn Abd al-Hamid\", Sheikh of Nizamia University, undertook the verification of the first, second, third, and half of the fourth volume (end of Surat Al-Baqarah interpretation - Vol 4, p 194). The young Sheikh: Muhammad ibn Imran al-A'zami al-Ansari al-Umari undertook the verification of the remaining volumes – may Allah Almighty reward them well in the Abode for how they did well by us. The edition was compared with the Morocco \"Rabat\" copy, the Arif Hikmat copy in Medina, the Zahiriyyah Library copy in Damascus, and the Egyptian National Library copy. The verifier took the Rabat copy as the original without mentioning its number to us, without explaining the reason for choosing it as the original over other copies, and without describing the copies he relied upon nor their numbers in their treasuries, which makes the matter ambiguous. He also did not write an introduction to the verification, which is a very important matter, especially since the book is being verified for the first time, and such a thing would not have cost him much, and I think he is capable of such a thing. The verifier was keen to mention the comparisons of copies in the margin, but he did not explain his methodology in this to us: Does he place in the main text what was in the mother copy even if another is superior, or does he place the correct reading in the text and the rest in the margin?",

    "text": "He did not explain to us. Therefore, you find him placing the correct reading sometimes in the text and the other in the margin, and sometimes you find the correct reading in the margin and the error in the text, and it is not from the mother copy. The verification methodology is not straight, and many of his verifications were built on erroneous reading and understanding far from correctness (1). The verifier burdened the margin with quoting much from the interpretation *Tabsri al-Rahman* by Ali al-Mahatmi, which is printed, and from *Al-Bahr al-Muhit* by Abu Hayyan, which is printed and circulated. There is no requirement for this burdening, and what he quotes does not clarify what \"Al-Biqa'i\" said. Had he directed his attention to adjusting the text, especially some words wrapped in ambiguity or vagueness in Al-Biqa'i's speech, editing it, indicating the clarification of the ambiguity of some phrases, and connecting the speech together due to the distance of its parts in Al-Biqa'i's explanation, it would have been more appropriate. And had he cared for dividing the speech and distinguishing it to help with good reading, it would have been superior. For I suffered greatly in reading the manuscript copy I relied upon in preparing my PhD research {Quranic Correlation according to Burhan al-Din al-Biqa'i} (1399-1402) under the supervision of my Sheikh Muhammad Abd al-Rahman al-Kurdi, despite the clarity of its Naskh script; yet it has misspellings, distortions, and severe omissions. The important point is that the Indian edition became like a rarity in Arab lands, and you can hardly find it except with prohibitive difficulty and at a high price. I suffered from collecting its volumes from the libraries of Hijaz and Najd during five years I resided there (1408-1412). The interpretation is worthy of being re-verified on more and older manuscript copies and published in a well-printed and produced edition.",

    "text": "If the Indian edition began (Year: 1389) and ended (1404), there is an edition like a stolen one from the Indian edition, committed in Beirut at Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah (1415). \"Abd al-Raziq Ghalib al-Mahdi\" undertook the extraction of verses and hadiths and placing footnotes. By comparing this Beirut edition, I became certain that it is the Indian edition transferred with all the errors in the Indian one. There was nothing but the deletion of the verification footnotes and placing hadith extractions in their place. As for the text of the interpretation, it is the same, distorted and misspelled even in the Quranic verses, as you see in the interpretation of the saying of Allah Almighty: {And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient} (Al-Baqarah: 155). Al-Biqa'i used as support in interpreting this verse the saying of Allah Almighty {Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah knows, while you know not} (Al-Baqarah: 216). The verse came in the Indian edition as follows (O you who have believed, fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you). Likewise in the Beirut edition. It is not hidden from you that the noble verse did not start with this call in the Book of Allah Almighty. Indeed, the matter reached the point that a part of a page from the interpretation was deleted from the Beirut edition: The last page of the first volume of the Indian (p. 357) (Beirut Vol 1, p 322, line 159). The one in charge of the Beirut edition did not notice the significant deletion in his edition which disrupted the text such that the speech does not make sense.",

Although Sheikh \"Abd al-Raziq al-Mahdi\" did well in what he did of extracting the hadiths in the interpretation, so may Allah Almighty reward him on our behalf with the best reward. Were it not for these extractions, the Beirut edition would have no scientific value... Second: Manuscript Copies: I said that the Indian verifier has great credit in bringing out this interpretation worthy of overflowing thanks, but the interpretation needs re-verification on other manuscript copies. The interpretation has very many manuscript copies in Egypt and abroad. I have before me texts listing dozens of manuscript copies and their locations, but I mention some of them, not all: - A copy at the Egyptian National Library under number (213 - Tafsir) in six volumes of large size. It is complete except for the amount of a leaf from the fourth volume (f. 373a - 374b). Its layout is (27 lines). It was written in the year (1270) by the hand of Muhammad Abu al-Fadl al-Safti. The total of its leaves is (2304 f). From it is a photocopy at the National Library number (1006 - Tafsir). I took the original as a source in preparing this PhD research of mine, as it is the clearest copy I could view in Egypt. I finished with it in the year (1402) and was not able to view any part of what was printed in India at that time. In this copy, there are misspellings, distortions, and omission of some words, as if the copyist was not among the careful people of knowledge. - - - - An incomplete copy of it, four volumes only, under number (285 - Tafsir at the Egyptian National Library). The existing volumes: First, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth. Some of the first volume was written during the author's lifetime. - - - - A complete copy under number (590 / 12855 - Tafsir) at Al-Azhar Library in seven volumes written between the years (1325 - 1331). Its script is good and it is in (3731: f). From it is a transcribed copy under number (2308) at Al-Azhar Library written in the year (1370). - - -",

Not a few people of knowledge used to speak in humility to Allah Almighty about Allah Almighty's favors upon them, as if they are announcing by this to people that if Allah Almighty has poured such favors upon them while they are who they are in the station of servitude to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, then how will He deal with one who is higher than them in that station?",

    "text": "In this, there is an urging for people to aspire to the stations of the Holy Effusion, and to establish themselves in stations of exposure to the breezes of Allah Almighty. Al-Biqa'i was one of those who frequently spoke about the favor of Allah Almighty upon him, especially the favor of His Majesty guiding him to author his interpretation \"Nazm al-Durar\". The phrases that followed in his interpretation expressing his joy with it are very many, including his saying: \"This is a wondrous book of high status in an art in which I have not seen anyone precede me, nor has penetrating thought relied upon it\" (1). His saying \"in an art in which I have not seen anyone precede me\" does not mean that he is the first to speak on the correlations (Munasabat) of the Holy Quran, for he has explicitly mentioned those who preceded him in that, but they did not undertake this in their contemplation of the entire Holy Quran, but rather in parts of it. Therefore, looking into his work and their work is requested, for he is the one who established his entire interpretation on the science of Quranic Correlation in all elements of Quranic eloquence. Truly, no one before him undertook this among those whose interpretations have reached us as he did in his interpretation. The origin of the science is undoubtedly preceded, but as for this comprehensive manner, he is truly unique in his age in it. Therefore, you see him mentioning the precedence of \"Abu Ja'far ibn al-Zubayr\" with his book (*Al-Burhan fi Tartib Suwar al-Quran*) and says: \"It is for explaining the appropriateness of following a Surah with another Surah only; he does not address verses in it\" (2). He mentioned \"Al-Zarkashi's\" book (*Al-Burhan fi 'Ulum al-Quran*) and said about it: \"I saw that he mentioned in it what defines the value of this book of mine\" (3). And he mentioned the interpretation of \"Jamal al-Din ibn al-Naqib\" (d. 698) named (*Al-Tahrir wa al-Tahbir li Aqwal A'immat al-Tafsir fi Ma'ani Kalam al-Sami' al-Basir*). His student \"Al-Dhahabi\" said about it in *Mu'jam al-Shuyukh* that it is in ninety-nine volumes covering Qira'at, causes of revelation, parsing, sayings of exegetes, and sayings of Sufis and their realities.\"",

    "text": "Al-Biqa'i said about the attention of this interpretation to the correlation of verses and Surahs: \"There is much of it in the treasury of the Hakim Mosque. I requested a volume of it and saw the matter was so regarding verses, not their sentences, and regarding stories, not all their verses. Whoever looks into this book of mine along with others will know the ratio between them\" (1). He said: \"Some Persian scholars spoke to me, and I asked them about something of that, and he found it difficult. Then I established for him the aspect of its appropriateness, and asked him: Did it become clear to him? He said: 'O my master, this speech of yours races to the mind.' So do not think, O viewer of this book of mine, that the correlations were like that before the unveiling of their mask and the lifting of their curtains. Many a verse I spent months contemplating, among them: {And [remember] when you left your family in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing} (Al-Imran: 121), and {And they request from you a [legal] ruling concerning women. Say, 'Allah gives you a ruling about them...'} (Al-Nisa: from verse 127), {They request from you a [legal] ruling. Say, 'Allah gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants...'} (Al-Nisa: from verse 176). Whoever wants to verify that, let him contemplate some of the verses before looking at what I said, then let him look at it; it will appear to him what I tired myself in, and what was achieved from Allah Almighty, and from the help, whether the face of that appeared upon his contemplation or not. Likewise, if he sees what others mentioned of correlations of some verses\" (2). He also said: \"These purposes are not revealed completely except to one who wades into the depth of this book, and becomes confident and correct from its beginning, end, and middle. None will remember except those of understanding. Al-Zarkashi mentioned about four leaves of correlations of some verses, and if you contemplate them, what is in this swelling sea of precious gems will become great in your estimation\" (3).",

He said about it: (The interpretation which ages have not allowed the like of, nor has flowed upon them from interpretations, despite their large numbers, like the pouring of its rain) (2). He mentions at its end, praising it, a poem of Majzu' al-Rajaz meter, saying: (I said praising the mentioned book for what it revealed of the wonders of destiny and strange matters, explaining my state and their state, and the success of my hopes and the disappointment of their hopes, from Majzu' \"Rajaz\" and its beat is Maqtu' and the rhyme is Mutawatir, Mutlaq, Mujarrad, naming it \"Kitab Lamma\" (Book of When/Since) because most of its purpose is explaining the connection of sentences to one another such that every sentence holds the belt of what is before it, connected to it. That is the intended manifestation of speech, its secret and core which is to speech like the soul. And explaining the meanings of vocabulary and every sentence on its own is like the body. So the soul is the greatest intent, realized by one who tastes and understands, and whose mind travels in the fields of structures and knows. \"Lamma\" is an adverb intended for the establishment of the second of what it entered upon by the establishment of the first at the utmost possibility, meaning it is like the conditional requiring two sentences, necessary for that necessary implication. So the book was completed in this system with \"Lamma\" because I frequently used it in it for this purpose (3). Among what he said about his interpretation in his book *Masa'id al-Nazar*:",

    "text": "The poor servant has contemplated it truly as should be in many places, and found it full of types of precious organized proportionate high pearls, crowned with types of shining expensive gems, its beginning fitting its end, and coupled with the subtleties of minute meanings and implication with observance of context and precedence. For this reason, it became a famous proverb in countries and horizons. None of the virtuous and scholars swam in its sea except the Very Learned Scholar... The Sheikh, the Magnanimous Imam, honor of the predecessors, best of successors, the teacher, the author, the Mufti Burhan al-Din Abu al-Hasan Ibrahim famous as Al-Biqa'i...\" (1). Other endorsements than this he established in his book (*Masa'id al-Nazar*), and he decides that his purpose was not to present his interpretation to any of the Imams to endorse it, but when some envious people spoke against it, he was forced to present it to the Imams to testify to what is in it. It was not his habit in the beginning of his affair to be keen on taking the handwriting of his sheikhs with their endorsement on his writings. His companions used to blame him for that, so he used to say to them: \"If I reach an age where knowledge is taken from the likes of me, if I am worthy in myself, I do not need the testimony of anyone, and if I am not worthy, the licenses of Sheikhs will not benefit me\" (2). Those whose endorsements Al-Biqa'i mentioned are not all his supporters in some of his stances in which he fought, especially his stances on Ibn Arabi and Ibn al-Farid and proponents of Unity of Existence (Wahdat al-Wujud) and Union (Ittihad)... You see him saying in the introduction of mentioning the endorsement of \"Amin al-Din al-Aqsara'i\": \"He inclined against the Sunnis in the fitna of 'Ibn al-Farid', and Allah - and to Him is praise - sufficed against him, and he harmed only himself.\" And he said in presenting the endorsement of \"Adud al-Din al-Sirafi\": \"He was silent in the fitna of 'Ibn al-Farid'.\"",

    "text": "This which I mentioned is some praise of his contemporary people of knowledge. As for the praise of scholars after him for this interpretation, it is very much, space does not allow mentioning it. It suffices you to look at what \"Ibn Hajar al-Haytami al-Makki\" said, who is among the obstinate opponents of Al-Biqa'i in his stance on Ibn al-Farid and Ibn Arabi, and what Al-Shawkani said about Al-Biqa'i's interpretation despite the fact that Al-Shawkani does not adopt the school of correlation of verses and Surahs. Al-Shawkani says: \"Whoever looks deeply into his book... in interpretation which he made regarding the correlations between verses and Surahs knows that he is among the vessels of knowledge, excessive in intelligence, combining the science of the rational and the transmitted. Often something in the Book confuses me, so I return to the long interpretations and their summaries and find nothing that heals, and I return to this book – Nazm al-Durar – and find in it what benefits mostly\" (1). *** ((The Opponents)) At the head of Al-Biqa'i's opponents was his peer \"Shams al-Din al-Sakhawi\": Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad (d. 902). He held the view that Al-Biqa'i had been audacious against the Book of Allah Almighty with this interpretation of his and that he relied on quoting from the Torah and Gospel in his interpretation. So \"Al-Sakhawi\" authored his book: \"Al-Asl al-Asil fi Tahrim al-Naql min al-Tawrah wa al-Injil\" (2). \"Al-Badr ibn al-Qattan\" was among the fiercest opponents of Al-Biqa'i, and the dispute heated between them, so \"Al-Biqa'i\" satirized him with what repels a person from mentioning (3). The summary of what the opponents objected to in his interpretation: This is a book whose existence among people is not lawful because it is two parts: - Transfer from the distorted ancient books: Torah, Gospel, and Psalms, and this is not lawful. - Speech from his own self, so it is interpretation by opinion which is not lawful. That he plagiarized the essays of others and attributed them to himself. There is no need for such an interpretation, nor reliance upon it, and it does not fill a gap in others.",

This is among what led to accusing him of disbelief, and attempting to establish the penalty for apostasy upon him (1). \"Ibn Iyas\" says in the events of the month of \"Dhu al-Hijjah\" of the year (877): \"Among the incidents in this month is that 'Al-Burhan al-Biqa'i' and the Judge of the Community 'Abu Abdullah al-Qaljani al-Maghribi al-Maliki' had a discussion regarding some issues. An answer occurred from 'Al-Burhan al-Biqa'i' in that assembly which the Judge of the Community recorded against him, and declared his disbelief, and testified against him (2). He wanted the lawsuit to be established against him before the Maliki Chief Judge. When the Confidential Secretary 'Ibn Mizhar' knew of that, he requested 'Al-Biqa'i' to his presence, and some judges ruled for sparing his blood. Were it not for the Confidential Secretary, no good would have happened to 'Al-Biqa'i'. What happened to 'Al-Biqa'i' was because of the sin of 'Ibn al-Farid', for he was the head of those zealous against him (3). 'Al-Biqa'i' continued in reversal until he died.\" \"Ibn Hajar al-Haytami\" says: \"It was recorded against him in his Correlations, so he was judged with disbelief and the shedding of his blood, and nothing remained of that except taking his soul, were it not that he sought help from some notables until he saved him from that predicament, and he was asked to repent in the Salihhiyah in Egypt and he renewed his Islam\" (4).",

It is not befitting for anyone, let alone a person of knowledge, let alone a Judge of the Community, to strive to make one of the Muslims fall into what does not please, nor to lie in wait for him counting his slips. Rather, the Muslim's nature is apologetic, accepting the excuses of his brothers, nay establishing excuses for them within himself increasing his approach to them even if they have no excuse within themselves.\n3.

The stranger thing – as he says – is that this renews for him at every question or whenever a difficulty appeared in the verse. He is the one who noted in this book of his quoting from a group whom the \"Egyptians\" did not know except from him, such as \"Abu al-Hasan al-Haralli\" and \"Abu al-Fadl al-Mashdali al-Maghribi\". Some Maghrebis asked him to drop the mention of \"Al-Mashdali\" from his interpretation so he would copy the book and send it to Morocco, for the Maghrebis do not acknowledge merit for \"Al-Mashdali\", so he refused that (3). ** The saying that the book does not fill a gap, there is no need for it, and no reliance upon it is refuted by the fact that his book stands such that were it not for it, most of them would be exposed if a debater stood against him regarding the Holy Quran, and conversed with him regarding many sentences from people of religions in a place where he is safe from injustice and does not fear the power of the sword. Then he mentions examples of those verses which, were it not for his interpretation of them, it would be possible for the obstinate disbeliever to attack many (4). ** The saying that he was asked to separate between his speech and the Quran but refused; I did not view a refutation by Al-Biqa'i on it.",

    "text": "Perhaps it is among what was rumored about him falsely, or he saw it as an opinion too trivial to reply to, and he is clearly right in this. For that is a very strange accusation for a man who announces morning and evening the affirmation of the inimitability of the Holy Quran. Add to this that mixing the Holy Quran with the speech of the exegete such that it does not appear is a matter that never stands, and people of knowledge do not all separate in their interpretations with the word (i.e. / meaning), and we see Al-Biqa'i mentioning it in his interpretation in numerous places in the manuscript copies. The truth is that this interpretation of his is not dispensable by other books of interpretation in the chapter of interpreting the appropriateness of sentences, verses, ties, and Surahs. No one becomes certain of its high status among previous and subsequent books of interpretation except one who endured and persevered in reading it a reading of research and inspection. As for one who looked into it a hasty look, he is closer to turning away from it than accepting it. It is among the books that teach the student of knowledge looking into it the methodology of contemplation and pondering due to the hidden meanings in it. Struggling with difficult knowledge has a pleasure, and Al-Biqa'i's interpretation grants you an overflow of that pleasure. I do not find sweet the explanation that is exposed, for dominant on such is its lack of many minute meanings and their subtleties and many Ihsani meanings, because the nature of those Ihsani meanings is such that exposed human explanation is incapable of carrying them. *** {Dalalat al-Burhan al-Qawim 'ala Tanasub Ay al-Quran al-Azim} It is as if Al-Biqa'i felt that the expansion of speech in his interpretation and his addressing of matters that others might see as not part of interpretation at all, or that do not help the reader with good following and awareness, especially one who is impatient with the trouble of reception, so he intended to summarize his interpretation: Nazm al-Durar, and named it (Dalalat al-Burhan al-Qawim 'ala Tanasub Ay al-Quran al-Azim).

Hence, I claim that this copy alone might not help its verifier in good verification and editing of the text. Perhaps Allah Almighty will destine for it one who possesses the ability to bring other copies aiding people of knowledge in verifying, editing, and publishing it. The verifier of the book (*Masa'id al-Nazar*) had the credit of guiding me to it, so may Allah reward him with the best reward. I had no knowledge of it while I was preparing my PhD research in the year (1399). In my library, there is a copy of this manuscript part awaiting completion and finding another copy to verify and bring it out to students of knowledge if Allah Almighty wills. The part I was honored to acquire a copy of ends with the end of the summary of the interpretation of Surah \"Al-Ma'idah\": The Introduction took from (f: 2 / b – 7 / a), Al-Fatiha from 7 / a – 35 / b), Al-Baqarah from (35 / b - 261 / a), Al-Imran from (261 / a - 327 / a), Al-Nisa from (327 / a - 399 / b), and Al-Ma'idah from (399 / a - to the end of the manuscript part). In the beginning of this manuscript copy (f: 1-7), his saying after the Basmalah, Hamd, and Salah: \"To proceed, I wanted in this Diwan of great status to summarize my book: Nazm al-Durar min Tanasub al-Ay wa al-Suwar min al-Furqan, because it became long by driving hadiths, turning over materials of language, and citing what witnesses from ancient books to the invalidity of religions opposing Islam... and I increase it - if Allah wills - replacing what I delete from it with what raises it over... Gemini and Libra. I adjust in it - as I did in its original - the Surah with a statement of its objective, for it is a guide to knowing its correlation. I indicate it by applying between it and the indication of its name whether that is one or more and whether it is a name of meaning or a letter of spelling; because the name of every Surah translates its objective; because for every thing, the appropriateness between it and its named is noticed, its title indicating in general the detail of what is in it.",

    "text": "I interpret the Basmalah with what suits that objective without departing from the indications of words from the perspective of language. Then I start in the Surah after linking its beginning to the end of what is before it. I interpret the word, whether from the names of Allah Almighty or others, according to the preceding and following speech, while preserving the linguistic law, even if extracting that from the speech of linguists is difficult for one who has not practiced the language. I interpret the word with two words or more as clarification because a single word does not stand in place of a word from the Quran at all. Thereby appear the secrets of specification of some synonymous names like Sanah, 'Am, Hawl, and Hujjah (year) in some places, while another synonymous to it does not stand in another place, for the context looks at the origin of the meaning from which that word is derived, so another meaning from the origin of derivation joins the meaning for which that word was coined, so the synonym does not stand in its place due to missing what the derivation performed as called for by the context...\" He expanded the discussion in the introduction of the (Summarized) book just as he expanded in the introduction of the original (*Nazm al-Durar*). He does not undertake summarization by deleting sentences from the original only; rather, he performs types of advancing and delaying, rephrasing, and adding things to the original: words, sentences, and paragraphs. Whoever compares his work in his interpretation of Al-Fatiha in the original (*Nazm al-Durar*) and his summary (*Dalalat al-Burhan*) realizes that his work in the Summary is straighter and more coordinated than his work in the Original. He does not care in the Summary to quote from the treatises of \"Al-Haralli\": Miftah al-Bab al-Muqfal, as his care for that was in the Original.

The axis of this is the servants' observation (Muraqabah) of their Lord; to single Him out in worship because He encompasses all attributes of perfection and is exclusive in them. So He is its objective essentially and other than Him are means to Him.

And what pleases Him is not known except through Messengers, and that will not happen except through what was mentioned of knowledge and action.

And how advancing the preposition indicated Oneness and that He is the God, and His name Al-Rahman indicated the clarification of laws by revealing books and sending messengers, and His name Al-Rahim indicated the success of some of the invited and the abandonment of some of them. And that this is the summary of Surah Al-Fatiha which is the summary of the detail of the rest of the Quran. He explained the reason for legislating seeking refuge (Isti'adhah) at the opening of reading and the ruling of this seeking refuge according to scholars and the formula which is most appropriate, and what is in the formula of seeking refuge of indicative signs, and what is in starting the Basmalah and ending it with a labial letter. Afterward, he started analyzing the Basmalah, concerned with interpreting the Beautiful Names in it. Here (f: 11/a) he does not quote from \"Al-Haralli\" as he was doing in the Original: \"Nazm al-Durar\", just as he is here more organized regarding the overlapping of speech in the Original, while the Summary he did not mix his speech with Al-Haralli's speech, so it was straighter. He expands the discussion in interpreting the Basmalah more than he expanded in the Original. He confirms that \"there is no repetition at all in anything of the Book of Allah Almighty, rather whatever you find in it repeated is for a meaning other than the preceding or for an increase in its meaning by emphasis for what the state required, so rhetoric is not complete except with repetition\" (f: 14/a). He points to the indicative sign of the number of Basmalah letters in script and their number in pronunciation, saying: \"The Basmalah being nineteen scriptural letters and eighteen pronounced ones is a sign that they are repellents of vengeance by the Fire whose keepers are nineteen, and bringers of mercy by the Rak'ahs of the five prayers and the Witr Rak'ah which are the greatest of worships\" (1). This is among what he mentioned in the Original. He explains the aspect of bringing Al-Hamd after the Basmalah and that this is from observing the counterpart.

While in the Original: \"Nazm al-Durar\" he quoted the essay of \"Al-Sa'd al-Taftazani\" on the aspect of opening five Surahs of the Holy Quran with 'Al-Hamdu Lillah', in the Summary \"Dalalat al-Burhan\" he mentions that in general without reference to \"Al-Sa'd's\" essay (f: 16/a). He quotes a little from \"Al-Haralli\" from his interpretation while expanding the quote from him in his interpretation and his treatise \"Al-Miftah\" in the Original: \"Nazm al-Durar\". He clarifies for us the aspect of describing Allah Almighty with his saying: \"Rabb al-Alamin\" (Lord of the Worlds), and he poured forth in explaining the meaning of the Worlds. Then he decides: \"That Mankind and Jinn are incapable of bringing the like of Basmalah and Hamdalah, nay even bringing a word parallel to a word of their words, and sufficing for it in all its indications. Likewise every verse of the verses of the Noble Quran, nay every word cannot have in its meaning in its style and the state which required it what stands in its place, even if counted as synonymous.",

It is either 'Ila' (to) which is the origin, like His saying, Glory be to Him: {Guide us to the straight path} (Al-Fatiha: 6) [Note: The verse cited here uses direct object, the example with 'Ila' is usually elsewhere, e.g., Yunus 25, possibly a slight confusion in text or referencing specific verse context] {And indeed, you guide to a straight path} (Al-Shura: from verse 52). Or 'Lam' (for) indicating that the Guide has great effect in guidance, and from it: {Indeed, this Quran guides to that which is most suitable} (Al-Isra: from verse 9). It may be expanded, so the preposition is deleted if a more eloquent effect is intended than what was intended by Lam, so it becomes transitive by itself, to indicate including the meaning of 'Ilzam' (bind/adhere), like His saying Almighty: {And guide you to a straight path} (Al-Fath: from verse 2). Like this letter, so the meaning is clearer to us by clarifying the road, and creating success in everything that pleases You, for me and all Your servants, that You guide us and lead us a very great guidance with kindness and support by adding the powers by which we are enabled to know the beneficial, and setting up proofs distinguishing between truth and falsehood, and illuminating our insights, and granting us success to adhere to (Al-Sirat), meaning the most perfect road as felt by the 'Lam' of perfection, and masculinity, the Wide Clear one which swallows [Yastrits - with un-dotted Sin] and swallows it due to what it has of width metonymized by its ease and clarity as indicated by the composition of its letters, and the difference of readers regarding them with contemplation of their attributes: The opening (Infitah) of its 'Sin' which is the origin in this material in the narration of 'Qunbul' from 'Ibn Kathir' and 'Ruways' from 'Ya'qub', and its 'Zay' generated from impregnating the 'Sad' in the reading of 'Hamza', and its 'Ra', and the whistling (Safir) of the first two, and the 'Sad' substituted from the 'Sin' according to the rest,",

There is another manuscript copy at the Egyptian National Library other than what the verifier mentioned, number (20323/b), copied from (19691/b) and its script is better, copied in the year (1356). And another copy in the library of Asir Efendi in Turkey = See Index of Rare Manuscripts by Al-Jaza'iri - Vol: 2 p 48, 69 - (MS) Egyptian National Library. Goal of the Book: Al-Biqa'i explains that his book stands to clarify the objectives of Surahs to realize the knowledge of the truth from the interpretation of every verse of those Surahs. It is as if his book completes his book: (Nazm al-Durar), for it is like an introduction to it. Therefore, he made its rank first in terms of being like a definition, so it is a general knowledge of the interpretation of Surahs, and his book (Nazm al-Durar) is a detailed knowledge of their interpretation. Thus, his book Al-Masa'id is among what is known as Quranic Sciences auxiliary to the science of Quran interpretation; it is among what speaks about the Great Quran and not among what speaks in it, so it is like what defines the philosophy of the science and not the science itself. His Methodology and Plan in it: \"Al-Biqa'i\" made for his book \"Al-Masa'id\" a long introduction in which he explained the name of the book, his invention of it, and the motive for authoring it due to what happened to him because of his book (Nazm al-Durar), mentioning scholars' stances on his interpretation, praise and objection. He quoted some endorsements of scholars for his interpretation, then spoke about the science of Correlation (Tanasub), defining it and explaining its status in the science of Rhetoric, its goal and benefit, and other things that occurred to him (1). Then he began dealing with Quranic Surahs as follows: - He explains the status of the Surah regarding Meccan and Medinan and scholars' opinions, determining the difference. In Surah \"Al-Fatiha\", he explains the rule of Meccan and Medinan saying: \"Everything revealed before the Hijra is Meccan, and everything revealed after it is Medinan, even if the Prophet, peace be upon him and his family and companions, was in another town at the time of its revelation...",

Then the order of the Uthmani Mushaf, transferred from the Mushafs which 'Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq', may Allah be pleased with them, copied, transferred from the parchments written before our Master the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his family and companions, by his command, and according to how he was commanded to arrange it as Allah Almighty commanded him, abrogated it [the chronological order]. He used to say when a verse was revealed to him: Put it in Surah such-and-such between verse such-and-such and the verse before it\" (1). He says in Surah \"Al-Imran\": \"Medinan by consensus, thus they said. 'Al-Najm al-Nasafi' said in his Taysir: Meccan in the saying of 'Ikrimah' and 'Al-Hasan al-Basri', Medinan in the saying of the generality of exegetes. 'Al-Ja'bari' said in Sharh al-Shatibiyyah: Medinan except five verses which are Meccan\" (2). He says in Surah Al-Nisa: \"Medinan by consensus, thus some said. 'Al-Asbahani' said except one verse revealed in Mecca in the Year of Conquest regarding 'Uthman ibn Abi Talha', which is: {Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice. Excellent is that which Allah instructs you. Indeed, Allah is ever Hearing and Seeing} (Al-Nisa: 58). It was said it was revealed upon the migration of the Prophet, peace be upon him. And it was said the Surah is Meccan. There is no disagreement that some of it was revealed in Medina. The apparent is the first, for in 'Al-Bukhari' from 'Aisha', may Allah be pleased with them: Surah 'Al-Nisa' was not revealed except while I was with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. And there is no disagreement that the Prophet, peace be upon him, consummated marriage with her in Medina\" (3).

That is because he holds that \"the name of every Surah translates its objective; because for every thing, the appropriateness between it and its named is noticed, its title indicating generally the detail of what is in it\" (1). He explains to us the names of Surah Al-Fatiha saying: \"So this Surah's name, along with Al-Fatiha, is Umm al-Quran, Umm al-Kitab, Al-Sab' al-Mathani, Al-Asas, Al-Mathani, Al-Kanz, Al-Shafiyah, Al-Kafiyah, Al-Waqiyah, Al-Shifa, Al-Ruqyah, Al-Hamd, Al-Shukr, Al-Du'a, and Al-Salah\" (2). He says in Surah Al-Baqarah: \"And it is named: Al-Sanam (The Hump), Al-Dhirwah (The Peak), Al-Zahra (The Radiant), and Al-Fustat (The Tent).\" He says in Surah \"Bara'ah\": \"Its name is also Al-Tawbah, Al-Fadhihah (The Exposer), Al-Bahuth (The Searcher), Al-Muba'thirah (The Scatterer), Al-Muthirah (The Excavator), Al-Hafirah (The Digger), Al-Mukhziyah (The Disgracer), Al-Musharridah (The Disperser), Al-Murshidah (The Guide), Al-Munakkilah (The Punisher), Al-Mudamdima (The Destroyer), Surah al-Bu'uth (Surah of Deployments), Surah al-Adhab (Surah of Punishment), and Al-Muqashqisha (The Curer)\" (3). ... - - - - He mentions the number of verses of every Surah and the schools of scholars regarding that, mentioning the aspects of difference and its locations. He mentions in Surah \"Al-Fatiha\" that the people of counting are five: Medinan, Meccan, Kufan, Basran, and Levantine. He explains the narrators of every school of counting, and explains that the cause of difference is Tawqif (divine instruction) like Recitation. \"Abu Amr said: These numbers, even if stopped (Mawquf) upon these Imams, they undoubtedly have a source they connect to, even if we do not know it, since every one of them met more than one of the Companions, witnessed him, and heard from him, or met those who met the Companions, while they were not people of opinion and invention, but people of adherence and following. And with Allah is success. Al-Sakhawi said meaning: 'If that were referable to opinion, the Kufans would have counted (Alif Lam Ra) as a verse, and would have counted (Alif Lam Mim Ra) as they counted (Alif Lam Mim Sad), and would have counted (Ta Sin) as they counted (Ya Sin), and would have counted (Kaf Ha Ya Ayn Sad) as two verses, as they did in (Ha Mim. Ayn Sin Qaf).",

And for them is a great punishment} (Al-Baqarah: from verse 7), and similar to that is much.'\" (1). It is not hidden to the companion of the Quran that dividing Surahs into verses will never be referable to a linguistic, grammatical, or semantic standard, for not a few of its verses have the subject in a verse and the predicate in another, and the agent in a verse and what it relates to in another verse. This is often not hidden to one of heart. There is a narration from the Mother of Believers \"Aisha\", may Allah be pleased with them, that the number of Quran verses is according to the number of degrees of Paradise. It is as if the companion of the Quran in this world is in a moral spiritual paradise whose bliss is not felt except by one who has a heart safe from the disease of heedlessness and a satisfied soul reassured by obedience to Allah Almighty. Whenever he reads a verse, his soul ascends in the steps and ladders of the Holy Proximity. He arranges on this his stance on the saying of Saj' (rhyme) in the Holy Quran, saying: \"From here we know for certain that there is no Saj' in the Book of Allah Almighty at all; for there is no doubt for one who has the slightest practice of that that 'Ta Sin' is more fitting for rhymers to 'Mubin' than 'Ya Sin' to 'Hakim'. Had Saj' been intended, consensus of counters would not have occurred that 'Ta Sin' is not a verse while some of them counted 'Ya Sin' a verse...\" (2). He expanded the discussion of critiquing the saying of Saj' in the Holy Quran just as he expanded it in Nazm al-Durar = He - also - explains what is in the Surah resembling separators but not counted as a separator by consensus of scholars, defining that and defining the rhyme (Rawi) of the Surah and scholars' schools in this. He says in Surah \"Al-Baqarah\": \"The number of its verses is two hundred eighty Kufan, seven Basran, and five in others. Their difference: Eleven verses.",

According to the extent of the objective of every Surah is its greatness, and that is known from what was narrated regarding its virtues.

He titled this chapter: \"The First Chapter on what is relied upon regarding the reward given to its reciter and what he obtains.\" Second: To explain the meanings of this verse, titling it: \"The Second Chapter in highlighting the meanings from its vocabulary and repeated themes.\" After the opening praise and salutations, he indicates that he had previously composed his interpretation *Nazm al-Durar* and mentions some of its merits, and that he followed it with his book: *Masa'id al-Nazar lil-Ishraf 'ala Maqasid al-Suwar*. \"I loved to single out the discussion from both of them regarding the Greatest Verse in a book I name: 'Al-Fath al-Qudsi fi Ayat al-Kursi', and I added to it what arouses desire and drives those of high aspirations towards it.\"",

He was concerned with mentioning the narrator of the hadith and the source of its narration, opening with the famous hadith of Ubayy bin Ka'b regarding the virtue of this Surah, which was narrated by Muslim, Abu Dawood, and Al-Qasim bin Salam in *Fada'il al-Qur'an*, and other books of Sunnah such as Musnad Ahmad, Al-Mustadrak, Shu'ab al-Iman, and Sharh al-Sunnah... In \"Al-Fath\", he mentions hadiths he did not mention regarding the virtue of the verse in his book \"Masa'id al-Nazar\", though he hardly concerns himself with commenting on these hadiths. The second chapter: \"In highlighting the meanings from its vocabulary and repeated themes\"—as he says—he explains the intent of the verse as \"Exclusivity in Sovereignty which necessitates complete Knowledge and comprehensive Power, which necessitates Exclusivity in Divinity; thus it is the Verse of Knowledge and Sovereignty.\" Then he explains the relationship of its name to its intent and its inclusion of the mother-issues of theology, containing the rules of religious beliefs. Among what he explained is that Monotheism (Tawhid) has three degrees: First: Testifying with the word of Sincerity (Ikhlas) based on correct belief, which is the Clear Tawhid... Second: The Tawhid of the Elite, which issues from deduction using evidence and clear proofs not mixed with doubt in any way. Third: The Tawhid of the Elite of the Elite: This is the dropping of apparent causes and ascending above the disputes of intellects and attachment to evidence. It is to not witness a proof in Tawhid, nor a cause in reliance, nor a means in salvation. He becomes a witness to the precedence of the Truth by His ruling, His action, His placing of things in their places, His suspending them, and His hiding them in their forms, not verifying the knowledge of causes, and treading the path of dropping the created event....",

    "text": "In these classifications of his, he does not rely on the Book of Allah Almighty, nor the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him), nor a narration from a Companion. Such a thing cannot be called Ijtihad (juristic reasoning), for there is no Ijtihad in theological inquiries except Ijtihad in understanding the text. The texts of the Book and Sunnah in the chapter of Creed (Aqidah) are definitive in implication; one does not need an interpretation that bears diverse or opposing facets. This is because difference in the chapter of Creed is a difference in the realm of Truth and Falsehood, Right and Wrong. The doctrinal truth has one face and one path. The sources of doctrinal understanding are two sources with absolutely no third: The Book and the Sunnah. There is no room for Consensus (Ijma') and Analogy (Qiyas), unlike the sources of Legal Jurisprudence (behavioral), which are four according to the majority: The Book, Sunnah, Consensus, and Analogy. The texts of the Book and Sunnah in the chapter of legislation have broad implications, and the scope of disagreement does not necessarily mean one is absolutely right and the other absolutely wrong, or absolutely lawful and absolutely forbidden; hence there was room for Ijtihad in interpretation. So, it was not for Al-Biqa'i to proceed to dividing Tawhid into those divisions without taking support from the Book and Sunnah. He addresses what came from Al-Hallaj, Ibn Arabi, and Ibn al-Farid, criticizing what came from them. His stance on them is not his stance on all Sufis, for he meets not a few of their seniors with reverence, especially their predecessors, and those who do not profess Unity of Existence (Wahdat al-Wujud) and Incarnation (Hulul) which appeared in the sayings of Ibn al-Farid and Ibn Arabi. He explains the meaning of \"Jam' al-Jam'\" (Union of the Union) among the Sufis and its relation to the degree of \"Ihsan\", the difference between \"Taste\" (Dhawq) and \"Knowledge\", and the wisdom of dispersing the proofs of Tawhid in the Holy Qur'an, and the verses of rulings and stories it contains. He is concerned with clarifying the location of the verse in its context and with interpreting and analyzing the vocabulary of the verse, especially the Beautiful Names it contains, and analyzing its sentences. He says in explaining its appropriateness to what precedes it:",

Then He made Himself known through actions, increasing them. When no ambiguity remained, He established Oneness with its preceding verse [v. 254] wherein He urged spending before the attack of the Day of Meeting, the day of severing of lineages and connection by relations, a day when nothing saves at the reckoning except the causes legislated by Allah Almighty. Likewise [is the connection to] what is before that which resembles it, interspersing that with varieties of wisdom, beauties of rulings, and types of encouragement and intimidation in precise construction and arrangement. When matters were complete and those deterrents were terrifying, and souls yearned, and thoughts looked forward to knowing the cause of the severing of connection by the cutting of ties, and the negation of intercession on that Day... Allah Almighty explained the attribute of the Commander regarding His Majesty, Greatness, effectiveness of command, elevation above an opposite, and transcendence above an equal or peer, and His exclusivity in all perfections and the preventing awe after its revelation there with the most complete revelation; so that aspirations would not turn to other than Him, nor speak without His permission, and that nothing would be other than what He wants. This is to be more conducive to accepting His command and stopping at His prohibition and deterrent. For the sake of these purposes, the speech was driven as an answer to a question, as if it were said: 'This is what is unknown of the conditions of kings; so who is the King on that Day?' So He mentioned the Verse of the Throne (Ayat al-Kursi), the Mistress of the verses of the Qur'an....\"",

    "text": "This shows you that the Name of Majesty (Allah) at the beginning of Ayat al-Kursi, in Al-Biqa'i's interpretation, is a subject (Musnad Ilayh), and its predicate is omitted, indicated by the estimated question derived from the context in which Ayat al-Kursi was established. It is as if the meaning is: 'Allah is the King on that Day.' This construction [defining both terms] implies exclusivity (Qasr). It is as if it was said: 'There is no King on that Day except Allah,' so that the following sentence comes explicitly stating what the first alluded to and confirming its content, saying (There is no god but He). Al-Biqa'i says: \"So He said (Allah), meaning the King who possesses all Beautiful Names, High Attributes, Majesty, and Honor, is the King on that Day. Then He explained what preceded by establishing for Himself attributes of perfection, purified from impurities of deficiency...\" Al-Biqa'i points out that the consecutive sentences in the structure of Ayat al-Kursi stand as clarification and detailing for what was firmly established in the opening sentence of this verse, which is a sentence where the Name of Majesty was mentioned alone. In the conclusions of his interpretation of the verse, he says: \"Every sentence that is started anew is a cause for what preceded it, arriving by way of clarification for what resulted from it. The clarification is united, as Al-Zamakhshari said, with the clarified; if a conjunction mediated between them, it would be, as the Arabs say: between the stick and its bark.\" That is more of what abounded in his interpretation of the Mistress of the Verses of the Holy Qur'an.

In the eight chapters, he spoke about the scholars' stance on his interpretation and cited eleven commendations by the seniors of his era for this interpretation (Al-Aqwal: 17-42). Then he clarified the ruling of quoting from the Torah, Gospel, and Psalms, the proofs for this ruling, the names of Imams of knowledge who preceded him and some who quoted, the sources of quoting and its locations.

    "text": "Al-Biqa'i also mentioned: \"In the virtues of Imam Abu Al-Hasan Ali bin Muhammad Al-Raba'i from Wathilah bin Al-Asqa' (1) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to me: 'Damascus will be the most populous city in the end times, a stronghold for its people, having the most Abdal (Substitutes/Saints), mosques, and men, and the least disbelief. And Egypt is the city with the most Pharaohs and disbelievers, the most injustice and immorality, and the most adultery and magic. When its outskirts are built up, the Dal [Dajjal/Antichrist?] will be sent, so woe to its people from his followers and partisans.'\" The editor mentioned that \"Al-Raba'i\" narrated the hadith (p. 44) at length, and Ibn Asakir (2/54) briefly without mentioning Egypt. Both are from the path of \"Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Ibrahim\" with his chain to Wathilah. And Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Ibn Asakir said about him: \"An unknown man.\" So the hadith is not established (2). In a treatise by Al-Suyuti titled: \"{Al-Khabar al-Dall 'ala Wujud al-Qutb wa al-Awtad wa al-Nujaba' wa al-Abdal}\" from the hadith of \"Wathilah\", may Allah be pleased with them, there is no mention of Egypt and its people; it is restricted to mentioning \"Damascus\" and its people (3). Investigators hold that every hadith narrated from the Prophet regarding the number of Awliya, Abdal, Nuqaba, Nujaba, Awtad, and Aqtab... nothing of that is authentic from the Prophet (peace be upon him). The Salaf did not utter any of these terms except the term \"Abdal\". A hadith was narrated about them that they are forty men, and that they are in Sham; it is in Musnad Ahmad, may Allah be pleased with them, from the hadith of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, and it is a disconnected hadith, not established.",

So the best of people cannot be in the army of our master Muawiyah, may Allah be pleased with him, excluding the army of our master \"Ali\", may Allah be pleased with him. They narrated in the Two Sahihs from Abu Sa'id, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: \"A renegade group will emerge at a time of division among Muslims; the party closer to the truth will kill them\" (Muslim: Zakat: 2/745 - Hadith No. 150). These renegades are the Haruriyyah Khawarij who emerged when the division occurred among Muslims during the caliphate of \"Ali bin Abi Talib\", may Allah be pleased with him, so he killed them. The authentic hadith indicates that \"Ali\", may Allah be pleased with him, was closer to the truth than Muawiyah, may Allah be pleased with him. So how can the Abdal be in the inferior of the two armies excluding the superior one, in Sham with Muawiyah, may Allah be pleased with him?\" (1) \"Ibn al-Qayyim\" says: The hadiths of Abdal, Aqtab, Aghwath, Nuqaba, Nujaba, and Awtad are all false (2). Philosophical Sufism, which took argumentation and theology as worship, had very bad effects on the progress of the Ummah. Many Muslims in past times inclined to those absurdities and delusions promoted by the masters of philosophical Sufism.

    "text": "The people of this path hardly expose their chests to the public in gatherings, nor do they give people the illusion that they are people of arrival and acceptance, and that they veil themselves from people out of fear for them from their lights shining from their hearts onto their lights. They are closer to hiddenness in their states with Allah Almighty. They set before their eyes and in their hearts filled with fear of Allah Almighty the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) which \"Muslim\", may Allah be pleased with him, narrated with his chain from \"Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas\", may Allah be pleased with him, who said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say: Verily Allah loves the servant who is God-fearing, rich [content], and hidden\" (Muslim: Zuhd: Hadith No. 11/29). Every scholar of the Book and Sunnah who acts upon them is on this Straight Path, and whoever is other than them is the misguiding deviant. The summary is that Al-Biqa'i was concerned with amassing many hadiths indicating the virtue of Sham and encouraging living there, and he did not guard against fabricated and weak ones. It was more appropriate for him, being a Muhaddith, to limit himself to what has a strong chain, for therein is sufficiency for his goal. *** {Inarat al-Fikr bi-ma huwa al-Haqq min Kayfiyyat al-Dhikr} (Illuminating Thought with What is the Truth regarding the Method of Remembrance).

    "text": "He says: \"When I returned from Egypt after a long absence to Damascus, hoping for a good return with few evils and many helpers against the oppressor... I found it had changed, its people had changed.... I found in its Great Mosque [Umayyad Mosque] people sitting in circles and chanting 'La ilaha illa Allah' in one voice from after the Friday prayer until Asr, a Dhikr they take out of its proper manner into the realm of disobedience with disturbing voices...\" (1) He narrates to us some of what happened between him and them when he forbade them from evil. In this book, quoting from the book (Al-Madkhal) by Ibn al-Hajj dominates. \"Al-Suyuti\", Al-Biqa'i's student, wrote a treatise titled: \"Natijat al-Fikr fi al-Jahr bi-al-Dhikr\" (The Result of Thought regarding Loud Dhikr) in which he establishes that there is no dislike in what the Sufi masters are accustomed to of holding Dhikr circles and reciting it loudly in mosques and raising voices in Tahlil. It was published within his book (Al-Hawi lil-Fatawi - Part Two). This treatise is like a contradiction to Al-Biqa'i's treatise \"Inarat al-Fikr\". It seems \"Al-Suyuti\" did not distinguish between the ruling of a thing in itself, and its ruling in a specific manner. No one said that loud Dhikr absolutely or in mosques at times other than prayers is not permissible, but what happens of that at the hands of those affiliated with Sufism is a matter wherein the least that can be said is that it obstructs some of what mosques were built for, such as prayer and teaching Qur'an and beneficial knowledge. .......Principles of Religion: Creed (Aqidah)....... Al-Biqa'i has several writings in the sciences of Creed and Theology. Al-Biqa'i was on the school of the companions of Abu Al-Hasan Al-Ash'ari. He was severe in opposing those who profess Unity of Existence (Wahdat al-Wujud) and those professing Union (Ittihad). He used to frequently denounce them and proclaim their misguidance whenever an opportunity arose in any of his works, especially his Tafsir, and he dedicated treatises to this. Among his works in Creed are what is printed, manuscript, and lost. Among the non-lost: {Tahdhir al-Ibad min Ahl al-Inad bi-Bid'at al-Ittihad} (Warning Servants about the People of Obstinacy regarding the Innovation of Union).",

There is a manuscript copy of this book in the Zakiyyah Collection at the Egyptian National Library and a copy in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin (Iraqi Al-Mawrid Journal, p. 200, No. 2, Vol. 3). The book was edited and published with another book by Sheikh: Abdul Rahman Al-Wakil\" under a title he invented, \"Masra' al-Tasawwuf\" (The Demise of Sufism) in the year: 1373 AH. Sheikh Al-Wakil, may Allah have mercy on him, should not have done that, for that title does not indicate Al-Biqa'i's stance on Sufism. The two books contain nothing but demolition of those who profess Unity of Existence, Union, and Incarnation. Most of those affiliated with Sufism do not say that, and do not see correctness in those who say it. Al-Biqa'i does not hold hostility towards all Sufis; rather, he takes a hostile stance against those who say what Ibn al-Farid and Ibn Arabi said regarding Unity of Existence, Union, and Incarnation. So the book exists to refute \"Ibn al-Farid's\" poem named: \"Al-Ta'iyyah Al-Kubra\" or \"Nazm al-Suluk\", which consists of seven hundred and sixty-one verses (761 verses) in the Tawil meter. Its beginning is: *The hand of my pupil gave me the wine of love to drink / And my cup was the face of the one who is exalted above beauty.* Many Sufi commentators collaborated to explain it, the first being \"Sa'd al-Din al-Farghani\" whose commentary is named: \"Muntaha al-Madarik wa Mushtaha Lubb Kull Kamil wa Arif wa Salik\", a manuscript at the Institute of Manuscripts in Cairo. \"Al-Biqa'i\" aimed at what this poem contains of contradiction to what the Book and Sunnah brought, and transgression of the truths of Shari'ah and the logic of a mind healthy from the disease of Shirk. He begins his speech by explaining that the path of the Jurists is the path of the great Sufis based on the Book and Sunnah, which is Behavioral Sufism. Whatever Ibn al-Farid and Ibn Arabi are upon is Philosophical Sufism. He states that the scholars judge the two men, Ibn Arabi and Ibn al-Farid, as disbelievers; he even goes so far as to say that whoever pauses in declaring them disbelievers is a disbeliever. He attacks the testimony of Ibn al-Farid's grandson for his grandfather, explaining what implies Sainthood (Wilayah) for a servant from the Book and Sunnah. *** {Tanbih al-Ghabi 'ala Takfir Ibn Arabi} (Alerting the Dimwit to the Takfir of Ibn Arabi)",

It is printed with the book: \"Tahdhir al-Ibad\" mentioned previously in a book titled \"Masra' al-Tasawwuf\" edited by: Abdul Rahman Al-Wakil\", referenced earlier. Al-Biqa'i says in its beginning: \"I named these papers: 'Tanbih al-Ghabi 'ala Takfir Ibn Arabi', and if you wish, name it: 'Al-Nusus min Kufr al-Fusus' (The Texts regarding the Disbelief of the Fusus).\" He finished writing it in Shawwal of the year eight hundred and sixty-four (864) in Cairo. If he made his book \"Tahdhir al-Ibad\" to refute \"Ibn al-Farid's\" poem \"Al-Ta'iyyah Al-Kubra\", he made his book \"Tanbih al-Ghabi\" to refute the book: \"Fusus al-Hikam\". He identifies the pivot of \"Ibn Arabi's\" speech in Al-Fusus as Absolute Unity, meaning that there is nothing other than this world, and that the God is a universal matter that has no existence except within its particulars. He asserts that whatever appears from \"Ibn Arabi's\" speech contrary to this is deception and obfuscation, rejecting the interpretation (Ta'wil) of his speech, for not every speech is interpreted and diverted from its apparent meaning. In this, he enters the chapter of precaution and repelling harm which every Muslim must hold fast to in the chapter of Creed, for the first thing that must be preserved pure and clear is Monotheism (Tawhid) stripped of every impurity of Shirk. It is upon scholars and rulers to compel people, with wisdom and good preaching and clarification of truth, to adopt that precaution, and not to leave people to what their devils from humans and jinn beautify for them. So everyone who persists in misguiding people and diverting them from what the Book and Sunnah brought should be taken to task. Al-Biqa'i tracks the sayings of \"Ibn Arabi\" in Al-Fusus, highlighting what is in them that contradicts the creed of Islam. He states that he relied only on a copy of Al-Fusus brought to him by one of those who believe in \"Ibn Arabi\" and are fanatical for him. This is from Al-Biqa'i's precision and precaution in scientific research and documenting his sources.",

    "text": "Al-Biqa'i's book \"Tanbih al-Ghabi\" met opposition from some scholars like his student \"Al-Suyuti\" (d. 911 AH), who wrote a book opposing it titled: \"Tanbih al-Ghabi bi-Tabri'at Ibn Arabi\" (Alerting the Dimwit to the Exoneration of Ibn Arabi). It was edited by \"Muhammad Ibrahim Salim\" in the year one thousand four hundred and fifteen (1415). Al-Suyuti did not explain the face of truth in Ibn Arabi's statements which Al-Biqa'i refuted. It was appropriate for him to refute Al-Biqa'i's arguments and show us the correct meaning of Ibn Arabi's speech and the proof for the correctness of what he says. But Al-Suyuti sufficed with mentioning the scholars who supported Ibn Arabi, as if a statement is proven to be true by who said it and who supported it, not by the truth contained in the speech. This indicates an inability to find what supports the speech from itself, which indicates that the speech itself does not contain what decisively proves its correctness. No one's speech is evidence for anything other than the Speech of Allah Almighty, then the speech of His Prophet (peace be upon him). If it is said: Allah, Majestic is His Majesty, said, or His Messenger (peace be upon him) said, and the attribution of the speech to them is authenticated, then the proof stands compellingly against one who believes in them. Otherwise, we need to establish proof for those who do not believe in them from the speech itself, not from the status of the speaker. Hence we heard the Truth Almighty calling to ponder His Speech and look into it so one may know it is the Speech of Allah Almighty: {Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction.} (Al-Nisa: 82) (1)",

His saying (much) is a description of the contradiction that occurs in other than the Qur'an; as for the Qur'an, there is no contradiction in it at all to be described as little or much. \"Abu Ja'far al-Tabari\" says in the interpretation of the verse: (He, Majestic is His Praise, means by His saying {Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an}: Do not those who plot other than what you say to them, O Muhammad, reflect upon the Book of Allah Almighty, so they may know Allah's proof against them in obeying you and following your command, and that what you brought them of Revelation is from their Lord, Majestic is His Majesty; due to the consistency of its meanings, the harmony of its rulings, the support of some parts by others in verification, and the testimony of some parts to others in truth? For if that were from other than Allah Almighty, its rulings would differ and its meanings would contradict, and some parts would reveal the corruption of others) (4 / 200).",

Al-Suyuti's method in this book is far from the scientific method, while Al-Biqa'i's method is based on principles of scientific research and verifying scientific issues. Al-Suyuti should have addressed every text Al-Biqa'i mentioned from Fusus al-Hikam by Ibn Arabi proving his disbelief, and revealed to us the face of truth that was hidden from Al-Biqa'i if there was truth in it, and the facet of its indication of that truth, instead of mentioning the names of scholars who believe in the Sainthood of Ibn Arabi. It was the sophistry of the disbelievers to oppose the Truth by attacking the one who supported it and not the Truth itself: {So the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, \"We do not see you but as a man like ourselves, and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of us [and] at first suggestion. And we do not see in you over us any merit; rather, we think you are liars.\"} (Hud: 27). Al-Suyuti argues that the one undertaking the Takfir of \"Ibn Arabi\" did not fear a bad reckoning, and that it would be said to him: Is it proven to you in a text that he is a disbeliever? If he says: His books indicate his disbelief. Is he safe from being told: Is it proven to you by an accepted path in transmitting news that he said this specific word? And that he intended by it its customary meaning? The first is impossible due to lack of a document to rely on for that, and fame now is of no consequence. Even assuming the origin of the book is proven from him, every single word must be proven; due to the possibility that what is not his speech was inserted into the book by an enemy or an atheist... The second: That he intended [such and such] by this word is also impossible to prove. Whoever claims it has disbelieved; because it is of the matters of the heart which no one views except Allah Almighty -",

Al-Suyuti should not have thrown himself into such exposed defect. He knows that scholars judge people's sayings and actions, not what is in their hearts, for that matter belongs to Allah Almighty. You have nothing from your brother except his speech and action; as for his heart, it is for his Lord Almighty. Sayings and actions are the mirror of what is in the hearts and the translator for them. No one utters a word of disbelief and atheism without legal compulsion and then says to people: Did you tear open my heart to judge me by that? The thing that tore open his heart is his tongue and pen. So the one who announces that Pharaoh – curse be upon him – is a believer, is he not thereby explicitly denying the clear and definitive Qur'an? Whether Ibn Arabi said that or someone else, the important thing is that the sayer of this is undoubtedly stating a disbelief that bears a likely or unlikely interpretation; because one who is like that, his speech is not interpreted. So what drives him to that?!!! In Fusus al-Hikam: The bezel of Sublimity Wisdom in a Mosaic Word regarding the picking up of \"Moses\" from the ark and the saying of his wife [Pharaoh's wife], may she be pleased: \"A coolness of eye for me and for you\" (Al-Qasas: 9), explaining how Moses, peace be upon him, was a coolness of eye for Pharaoh.",

Is this not explicit in denying what the Holy Qur'an and authentic Sunnah brought regarding Pharaoh's disbelief and that he is among the people of the Fire? {And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs and a clear authority * To Pharaoh and his establishment, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not right. * He will precede his people on the Day of Resurrection and lead them into the Fire; and wretched is the place to which they are led. * And they were followed in this [world] with a curse and on the Day of Resurrection. Wretched is the gift which is given.} (Hud: 96-99). Did the author of Fusus al-Hikam not read the saying of Allah Almighty (He will precede his people on the Day of Resurrection and lead them into the Fire)? Is this not definitive that Pharaoh leads his people to the fire of Hell? {But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a ruinous seizure.} (Al-Muzzammil: 16). The author of Al-Fusus goes further than this when he views that criminals in this world reach in the Hereafter the very essence of nearness to Allah Almighty. This is when discussing the saying of Allah Almighty: {And We will drive the criminals to Hell as a watering place [thirsty].} (Maryam: 86)",

When He drove them to that spot, they obtained the essence of nearness, so distance vanished, and the named 'Hell' vanished in their right. Thus they won the bliss of nearness by way of entitlement; because they are criminals. He did not give them this sweet taste-based station by way of favor, but they took it by what their realities deserved from their deeds they were upon.

    "text": "He says: \"Do you not see 'Ad, the people of Hud, how they said: 'This is a cloud bringing us rain,' so they thought good of Allah Almighty, and He is as His servant thinks of Him [sic]. So the Truth turned away from this saying to them, and informed them of what is more complete and higher in nearness. for if He rained on them, that would be the luck of the earth and watering the grain, so they would reach the result of that rain only after a distance. So He said to them: 'Rather, it is that for which you were impatient: a wind, within it a painful punishment.' He made the wind a sign for what is in it of comfort (Rahah) [sic]. For by this wind, He relieved them of these dark structures and rugged paths and dark gloom. In this wind is a punishment ('adhab), meaning a matter they find sweet ('adhb) if they taste it [sic], except that it pains them because of separating from the familiar\" (1). No sane person advising himself and his Ummah can claim that these statements of the \"Author of Fusus al-Hikam\" are not manifest misguidance, and do not proclaim explicit disbelief for their speaker. \"Al-Suyuti's\" argument that there is no proof that \"Ibn Arabi\" said this is closer to deception. Whether he said it or it was attributed to him, this statement is a statement of explicit disbelief. So whoever originated it, narrated it believing its correctness, or is pleased with it, has fallen into disbelief; because it is a repulsion, rejection, and destruction of what stands in the Book of Allah Almighty, a standing that bears not the slightest interpretation contrary to its explicit appearance. \"Ibrahim bin Muhammad Al-Halabi\" (d. 952) has a treatise: \"Tasfih al-Ghabi fi Takfir Ibn Arabi\" (Fooling the Dimwit regarding the Takfir of Ibn Arabi) in which he replies to Al-Suyuti. I was not able to see it. I expanded the discussion here for reasons: - The relationship of this to interpreting the Quranic Bayan (clarification) contrary to the correct face and method.",

    "text": "- That many of the agitators of Fitnah in the Ummah among the secularists controlling the reins of culture and media in our lands struggle to publish the works of atheists, renegades, and distorters of words from their places, such as: \"Ibn Arabi\", \"Ibn Sab'in\", and \"Ikhwan al-Safa\". The cultural institutions in the Ministries of \"Culture\" and \"Information\" collaborated to facilitate the entry of this destructive atheistic heritage into the libraries of the youth and the common people, many of whom do not master understanding a journalistic article, let alone understand the delusions in the works of those saboteurs. If you asked the Minister of Culture himself and the Minister of Information himself about the meaning of anything published by the ministry of those falsehoods, silence would be his refuge. So how about one who does not master reading a book from the Ministry of Education books despite their shallowness and cultural and scientific poverty?!!! I would not have raised dust in the face of Ibn Arabi and his followers if his heritage were buried in libraries and manuscript repositories, looked into only by people of knowledge capable of distinguishing truth from falsehood. But for government institutions to work on publishing their heritage while leaving the heritage of investigative scholars like Al-Shafi'i, Al-Biqa'i, Al-Khattabi, Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi the Maliki Jurist, Al-Shatibi, Al-Bayhaqi, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn al-Qayyim, Al-Shawkani, and those who supported them in protecting the creed of Monotheism from those delusions inserted by many atheists, the matter requires struggle and combat pleasing to the Lord of the Worlds. Silence about confronting their falsehood is pleasing to Satan and angering to the Most Merciful. *** {Tahdim al-Arkan min Laysa fi al-Imkan Abda' mimma Kan} (Demolishing the Pillars of 'There is nothing in possibility more wondrous than what is').

He finished it in the year eight hundred and eighty-three (883 AH) in Damascus. In it, he discusses the statement: \"It is not in Allah's possibility Almighty to invent a world more wondrous than this world.\" \"Al-Ghazali\" had mentioned that in some of his works, so it stirred controversy.",

The creation of humans in the best form does not negate that among a species, some individuals may be better than others, and there is no limit to the perfection among them. One observes the variety of individuals in their own species; Allah's power is limitless. Beware of accepting what is mentioned in Imam Al-Ghazali's books that nothing could possibly be better than what exists. Even though he responded to objections in his book, that response is not decisive because it would imply that Allah cannot create a world better than this one, which no one claims. This does not diminish the value of Al-Ghazali; everyone’s statements can be examined and critiqued, as Imam Malik said. Al-Ghazali himself attributed his knowledge to Ibn ‘Abbas. Imam Al-Shafi‘i said: 'I have written these books and exerted my utmost effort, yet I know they contain errors; for Allah says: {And if it had been from other than Allah, they would have found therein much discrepancy} [An-Nisa: 82].' Al-Biqai also explains the verse: {It is Allah who created seven heavens and of the earth the like of them. His command descends among them so that you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge} [At-Talaq: 12].

And beware of turning to the one who said: 'It is not possible to create [something] more wondrous than this world'; for this is a wicked philosophical doctrine, and the verse is a text in its invalidation. Even if some atheists attributed it to 'Al-Ghazali', I do not doubt that it was fabricated against him!!! For it is a wicked philosophical doctrine by the testimony of 'Al-Ghazali' as I clarified in my book: 'Tahdim al-Arkan min Laysa fi al-Imkan Abda' mimma Kan' (Demolishing the Pillars of 'Nothing in Possibility is More Wondrous than What Was'), and my book: 'Dalalat al-Burhan 'ala anna fi al-Imkan Abda' mimma Kan' (Evidence of the Proof that in Possibility is Something More Wondrous than What Was), and my book: 'Itbaq al-Aghlal fi A'naq al-Dalal' (Locking the Shackles on the Necks of Error). Despite being a doctrine of philosophers, the most disbelieving of renegades, 'Ibn Arabi', adopted it and placed it in his 'Fusus' and other books of his, relying in it in some of them on 'Al-Ghazali' to perfect his plotting – may Allah protect us from his evil – and 'Al-Ghazali' is innocent of it by the testimony of what was found of his beliefs in 'Al-Ihya' and others\" (1). And his saying when interpreting the saying of Allah Almighty {We have certainly created man in the best of stature} (At-Tin: 4): \"And the form 'af'al' (superlative/elative) does not indicate what the heretics said, even if that was attributed to some of the great ones, from their saying: 'Nothing in possibility is more wondrous than what was'; because a single degree varies to what cannot be counted, like the variation of humans in their forms and colors and other aspects of their existences and wondrous affairs. I have clarified that in a separate composition for this phrase which I named: 'Tahdim al-Arkan min Laysa fi al-Imkan Abda' mimma Kan', and I clarified it with the utmost clarification and explanation. Trials occurred in it that deafen the ears, and Allah Almighty supported the truth by the agreement of notables, and vanquished the people of tyranny. Then I followed it with the book 'Dalalat al-Burhan 'ala anna fi al-Imkan Abda' mimma Kan', then I cured the ailments, refuted the opponents, and repelled the illusions with 'Al-Qawl al-Fariq bayna al-Sadiq wa al-Munafiq' (The Distinguishing Word between the Truthful and the Hypocrite), which is about two pages of utmost creativity in cutting off the dispute.",

    "text": "It is possible that the form 'af'al' is restricted relative to something Allah Almighty willed such that we realize it, because it is agreed upon among Ahl al-Sunnah, and stated by 'Al-Ash'ari' and others in more than one place in their books, that Allah Almighty's capabilities are infinite. Among those who stated what 'Al-Ash'ari' stated and elaborated on it is the Imam, Hujjat al-Islam 'Al-Ghazali' in his books 'Al-Ihya' and others, especially: 'Tahafut al-Falasifah' (Incoherence of the Philosophers), where he clarified that this [i.e., 'nothing in possibility is more wondrous than what was'] is one of their rules for negating the attribute of Will, and their saying that His action is by essence, and he clarified the corruption of that\" (1). This issue is related to the fundamentals of creed (Aqidah) which we should strive to keep pure and cleansed from every impurity. I believe that the greatest mission, most worthy of care, attention, and struggle by scholars, is the protection of the creed of Monotheism (Tawhid) – first and foremost – from the misleading of people of intellectual immorality, doctrinal error, and corruption in the hearts of servants hovering around its sanctuary. And that the ruler – if he wants good for his nation – must assist the scholars in that and empower them in the land, and lie in wait for those who infiltrate the hearts of servants with their doctrinal errors from atheist philosophers who distort words from their [proper] places. This is the most important and takes precedence over others, even if others are very important, for falling into drinking a glass of wine is not like falling into the trap of Shirk (polytheism). Allah Almighty has decreed, saying emphatically in the Surah of establishing the Muslim family upon His guidance, Mighty and Exalted, Surah 'Al-Nisa': {Indeed, Allah does not forgive that you associate partners with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin} (Al-Nisa: 48) {Indeed, Allah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray} (Al-Nisa: 116).",

Dr. \"Muhammad Ahmad Al-Qasim\" surmised that the book \"Tahdim al-Arkan\" and the book \"Dalalat al-Burhan\" are one book and not two, and that what appeared in Hadyat al-Arifin contains an omission like (Ibtal or similar).

Al-Biqa'i had no choice but to confront the claim that such a thing is obligatory or that it is Sunnah, for he struggles so that nothing is attributed to the Sharia that is not from it. This does not mean that he forbids reciting Al-Fatiha after prayer, but rather forbids saying that it is obligatory or that it is from the Sunnah or that it is a recommended act (Nafilah). We must distinguish between saying something is forbidden to do and saying that doing that thing is Sunnah when it is not proven to be Sunnah. Whoever performs an act of obedience that is not timed with a time, then times it or restricts it and claims that the timing and restriction are Sunnah, has lied against the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his family and companions.",

A treatise in six folios of small size, containing nothing new, based on mentioning definitions and examples in grammar chapters, as if it were written for young students. He finished authoring it in the year eight hundred thirty-six (836) in Cairo, i.e., at the beginning of his arrival in Cairo, and perhaps he was working teaching young students.

O Copy of Shahid Ali in Turkey under number (204) within a collection. This book is not indicative of \"Al-Biqa'i's\" standing in the science of Arabic grammar; rather, his standing in it you see clearly and highly in his Tafsir Nazm al-Durar, for he has in it contemplation of Quranic grammar issues that indicates to you his mastery in this science, and he often digresses in explaining a grammatical issue and what grammarians said about it, and what he approves of that because of its relation to the science of Quranic correlation. *** .....History and Biographies...... Al-Biqa'i had great attention to history and biographies of notables, as if he was influenced by his sheikh Al-Maqrizi and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani. He left us a distinct heritage in the art of history and biographies. I have not seen printed of it except one part of one of his historical books, which is \"Izhar al-Asr\", and the dictionary of his sheikhs and peers is worthy of being verified and published: {Akhbar al-Jallad fi Futuh al-Bilad} (News of the Struggle in the Conquests of Countries).",

In it, he spoke about the conquests until the end of the caliphate of our master \"Uthman\", may Allah be pleased with them. As for the caliphate of our master \"Ali\", may Allah be pleased with them, it was not an era of conquests but an era of internal disputes over the caliphate (f: 523-524). In its opening, he mentioned his sources of books and scholars, the value of each scholar and book, and the degree of his truthfulness and investigation (f: 3). Then he listed the verses of Jihad and what he himself said in urging Jihad (f: 4-15). He spoke about what was before the mission and the kings and rulers in it (f: 15-33). Then he reviewed the Islamic conquests (f: 33-523) and singled out the conquest of his town: \"Al-Biqa' al-Azizi\" for discussion (f: 150). He finished authoring it in the year eight hundred eighty-four (884 AH).

Attributed to him in Kashf al-Zunun (1/118, 171), Mu'jam al-Musannifin (3/278), and Hadyat al-Arifin (1/22). He made it a sequel to the history of his sheikh Ibn Hajar called (Inba' al-Ghumr bi Akhbar al-Umr), which began with the news of the year seven hundred seventy-three (773). He stopped in it at the news of the year eight hundred fifty (850), which was also like a sequel to the history of Ibn Kathir which ended with the news of the year seven hundred seventy-three. In his history, he begins with Muharram of the year eight hundred fifty-five (855) and ends with Dhu al-Hijjah of the year eight hundred fifty-seven (857). The book was verified by Dr. Muhammad Salim Al-Awfi, Associate Professor at Imam University in Riyadh. He questioned: Is what is between (850-855) missing or did Al-Biqa'i not write it? (1)",

Among what he said was: \"Al-Biqa'i presented in detail the events of his time... and described what was happening in his era of political situations, military events, social manifestations, and natural events. He described the struggle for power and competition for positions of leadership and pioneering in society... and presented the customs and traditions that prevailed in his society... He described the Mamluks, the imported slaves (Ajlab), and soldiers in their revolutions... and the epidemics and famines that afflicted society... He also paid attention to currency, its increase and decrease. Likewise, he chronicled the deaths of the most important notables of his time and also cared about the Mamluk state's relationship with neighboring kingdoms in peace or war... His interest in Egypt did not divert him from following the news of the Levant. The importance of Al-Biqa'i's history increases if we know that he was at odds with the Mamluk authority, looking at it with indignation and resentment, as he suffered harm from it... unlike the most important contemporary historians to him: Ibn Taghri Bardi and Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Iyas, who were of Mamluk origin, imported, and indeed close to the Mamluk state and possessors of wealth and feudal estates in it...\" (1) ***** {Badhl al-Nush wa al-Shafaqah li Suhbat al-Sayyid Waraqah} (Exerting Advice and Compassion regarding the Companionship of Master Waraqah).

So Al-Biqa'i provided evidence for his Islam and Monotheism before the Mission (f: 2) and his resolve to support the Prophet, peace be upon him. He cited news indicating his Islam and that he is in Paradise (f: 49). He spoke about Zaid bin Amr (f: 12) and the difference between him and Waraqah (f: 18) and between him and Abu Talib (f: 43). He spoke about the definition of the Sabian (f: 46) and about the disbelief of Al-Muqawqis (f: 48). Then he elaborated on the biography of \"Waraqah\" (54-68).

A dictionary in which he chronicled his sheikhs and peers in seeking knowledge. He arranged the names of the biographees alphabetically, starting with the name (Ahmad) for blessing. Among what is noted about it are matters: He committed to mentioning lineage, titles, kunyas, birth, and death if it had occurred when recording the biography. He relies on meeting, oral transmission, and writing for whom he chronicles, and repeats the meeting and compares and confronts with the discrepancy if it occurs (Vol: 2 p 168, Vol 3 p 135).",

Repetition of biographies of some notables occurred, perhaps from the copyists or an oversight from him (Vol: 2 p 29, 68, 71, 101).

Its subject is clear from its title. It is a book worthy of verification and publication in this time of ours if it were available. How much we need such a thing, as we have fallen into the \"swamp\" of that detestable sin until people became certain that there is no harm in this, while it is very serious in Islam. We are now in a time where the matter is confused, so many of the common people and some of the elite intellectuals undertake the evil thinking it is not evil. If the matter were explained to them nicely and the explanation repeated by major scholars in lecture halls, mosques, forums, and media, the difference between the Known (Ma'ruf) and the Denied (Munkar) legally would be established in their hearts. Indeed, it is a great obligation on the scholars of Islam to explain to people what is Ma'ruf and what is Munkar in the Book and Sunnah with wisdom and fair preaching, for that is a great principle of Commanding the Good and Forbidding the Evil. ***** {Tatmim Isaghuji} (Completion of Isagoge). There is a handwritten copy of it in \"Shahid Ali Library in Turkey\" within a collection containing books by Al-Biqa'i under number (2804).

    "text": "Increasing the authoring and publishing of books refuting the errors that strike at the doctrinal foundations of the Muslim Ummah is a great matter that a scholar should not tire of, nor say 'I have already written a book on this', especially in an era where various sects flock and collaborate to entrench error, like this era of ours. Many a word written by a scholar is not heard by many, and another word penetrates everywhere and revives in every land. People of knowledge have said: What is repeated is established. Whoever wants to establish something in the hearts calls it out morning and evening in the ears of the servants, for it will inevitably penetrate their hearts. This is what the media in our countries pursues, not ashamed of mentioning, publishing, repeating, and varying the call to what they want to establish in the hearts of servants of low morals and bad lifestyles far from the Book and Sunnah. ***** {Tahdhib Jumal al-Khawnaji} (Refinement of Al-Khawnaji's Sentences).

This is also inaccurate; these are not books by Al-Biqa'i, but rather poetic verses in which he arranged the chapters and sections of each book to facilitate memorization.

Second: Hadith and Sciences of the Sunnah. Third: Creed, Theology, and Logic. Fourth: Science of History and Biographies. Fifth: Science of Jurisprudence and its Principles.

    "text": "Chapter Two: His Methodology in Interpreting the Rhetoric of the Holy Qur'an. Introduction to the Methodology. Al-Biqa'i established his contemplation of the Holy Qur'anic statement on the basis that all its words, sentences, verses, passages, and surahs are linked to one another with a semantic and rhetorical connection. Every element of it - if the expression is permitted, and I fear it may not be - holds the belt of what is in front of it. And that every Surah has a great universal objective dominating all its parts; it is to it like the spirit to the body in the world of creation, while the Holy Qur'an is from the world of command. This is but an approximation of what is from the world of command using something from the world of creation, called for by my rhetorical inability to fulfill the saying regarding the Holy Qur'an as befits it. Otherwise, most of our rhetorical terms that we chew in tasting our human statement hardly befit the speech regarding contemplating the Holy Qur'anic statement. This implies with a dazzling, compelling implication - about which one who advises himself and submits to the principles of healthy rational observation free from sterile argumentation would not hesitate - that the miraculous rhetoric of the Holy Qur'an silencing all worlds is not in some of what was revealed but in all of what was revealed. There is not the slightest hesitation in this for one in whose heart it is established that the Holy Qur'an is from Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted, alone. If this is correct - and it will only be correct and eloquent - then what was revealed is not the Qur'anic meaning alone, nor the order of the sentence or verse alone, but all of this was revealed, and the position of every word in its sentence, every sentence in its verse, every verse in its passage, every passage in its Surah, and every Surah within the total context of the Holy Qur'an. Thus, the position where the word stands and what is above it up to the Surah is from what was revealed. So there must be, in the position where the word, sentence, verse, passage, and Surah were placed, a miraculous rhetoric which is the sign of the Muhammadan Prophethood, immortal as long as life remains on this earth.",

    "text": "This necessitates with an urgent, binding requirement that the contemplation of the Holy Qur'an, which is an obligation, be based on the rhetoric of all that was revealed, including the location of words, sentences, verses, passages, and Surahs. Therefore, Al-Biqa'i believes that it is obligatory to contemplate what can be called in human expression the Rhetorical Unity of the text built upon the Unity of its Universal Objective and the Unity of the Significance (Maghza) it aims for. The word \"Significance\" (Maghza) is one of the glorious words in this context, revealing the great effort of the human clarifier in high expression in his striving to reach his goal, standing like a ghazi (conqueror) with the armies of his words, structure, and tone, captivating the hearts of the receivers, capturing them with the ammunition of enchanting words he possesses, and establishing in the tent of hearts the hidden meanings which are his immortal rhetorical existence, as his physical existence perishes after a while and he remains as a rhetorical existence as long as life remains. The important thing is that the Holy Qur'an as a whole comes to a great end; its words, verses, passages, and Surahs came proportionate and brotherly to reach that end and that significance, and to convey to the heart free from arrogance the meanings of guidance to the Straight Path leading to the pleasure of the Speaker of this Noble Book - Majestic is His Glory. Al-Biqa'i, in his contemplation of the Holy Qur'anic statement, made the pivot of his contemplation its miraculousness existing in every sentence of its sentences, verse of its verses, passage of its passages, and Surah of its Surahs. That is the proportion (Tanasub) of the meanings of its statement and structures. That miraculousness is the spirit flowing in all the numerous, extensive faces of Qur'anic inimitability which are endless and encompassed by none, for it is one of the blessings of Allah Almighty that cannot be counted. This tempts us to seek to briefly explain the concept of Qur'anic Proportion in meaning and structure according to Al-Biqa'i, and its levels and fields, then we clarify the features of his methodology in contemplating the traits of this miraculous proportion.",

    "text": "Qur'anic Proportion according to Al-Biqa'i. The Concept. From what Al-Biqa'i named his interpretation: \"Nazm al-Durar fi Tanasub al-Ayat wa al-Suwar\" (Stringing of Pearls in the Proportion of Verses and Surahs). It is a naming he intended deliberately, for one of his principles that he adopts is the relationship of the name to the named. He considered naming as part of the brilliant opening indicating what is hidden in the named. We will look into this principle of his in its appropriate place, God willing. You see he made his work a \"Stringing of Pearls\" on the subject of \"Proportion of Verses and Surahs\". Perhaps he is looking at the relationships of agreement and divergence between Order (Nazm) and Proportion (Tanasub), for every proportion is an order, but not every order is a proportion. In Proportion - as will come God willing - there is what is not in Order: \"Proportion\" (Tanasub) comes from three roots: \"N / S / B\" revolving around the meaning: \"connection of a thing to a thing\" as \"Ibn Faris\" says in \"Maqayis al-Lughah\". This connection is an essential connection; it is based on internal relationships running in the essence of the proportioned items, and regulating their external aspects. This is what you see in the human world: the relationship of lineage among them is an essential relationship running in their joints, shaping their moral and physical traits, and they are eternal relationships. The world of rhetoric is from the world of humanity; the word in it is like the individual in the world of humanity. These two worlds: the Rhetorical and the Human, proceed on a similar path in many of their conditions. This term: \"Proportion\" (Tanasub) has an indication of its meaning different from the indication of \"Order\" (Nazm) of its meaning adopted by \"Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani\" for his theory. The indication of the term Nazm on its meaning requires explanation with a precaution against including what is not intended. Hence, you find Imam \"Abd al-Qahir\" saying: \"Among what must be mastered... is the difference between our saying: ordered letters and ordered words. For the 'ordering of letters' is their succession in pronunciation, and their ordering is not due to a meaning, nor does their orderer follow in that a drawing from the mind to pursue in his ordering of them what he pursued. If the establisher of language had said 'Rabad' instead of 'Darab' (he struck), there would be nothing in that leading to corruption.",

So it is an order in which the condition of the ordered parts with each other is considered, and it is not the 'Order' whose meaning is joining a thing however it came and happened...\" (1). \"Proportion\" (Tanasub) does not need its speaker to take precaution likewise unless he places the word out of its place, and does not notice the germ of its derivative meaning signaling that it is an internal relationship running in things like the spirit in the body, possessing external effects accompanying it, subject to its authority. So between the verses of the Holy Qur'an, its rhetorical sentences, passages, and Surahs, there are spiritual relationships, with a deep lineage between them. It is as if in its appearance and perception, it is like the relationships of the sons of Adam to each other: \"All of you are from Adam,\" as the purified Prophetic word guided, even if that lineage in its attachment and effects is greater and more majestic than what is between the sons of Adam. \"Al-Biqa'i\" makes Qur'anic Proportion a science among the sciences of the Holy Qur'an, revealing its concept by saying: \"A science through which the reasons for the arrangement of the parts of the Qur'an are known, and it is the secret of rhetoric because it leads to achieving the conformity of speech to what the situation requires\" (2). When using the term \"Science\", he proceeds from its concept in Arabic terminology, indicating \"realizing principles and rules based on evidence, and the possibility of recalling them whenever desired.\" Through this, the student stands in a position of understanding and knowledge of the causes requiring the placement of every word and what is more than it in the appropriate location, and in the suitable form. You notice that \"Al-Biqa'i\" has defined this science by its effect, not its reality and essence, so he said: A science through which is known. By this, he reveals to us the effect of this science on one who encompasses or realizes it. By realizing its principles, we stand upon what required the parts of the Holy Qur'an - the word and what is above it - to be placed in their rank in which they were placed.",

Insight into Rank is above Insight into Order: In \"Arrangement\" (Tartib), the ranks of things and their measures are observed, so nothing is placed except in the rank it deserves. As for Order (Nazm), its origin is joining things to one another without restriction by observing the ranks of these things and their stations. Looking at the saying of \"Abd al-Qahir\" increases your insight into this: \"And I found the reliance to be that there is here (Order and Arrangement / Compilation and Composition) and (Drafting and Portrayal / Weaving and Adornment)\" (2). The Imam arranged these eight in this place in a wondrous sequence indicating their escalation. The beginning of the stages of \"Building\" is \"Order\", and its end is \"Composition\". The beginning of the stages of Form (Portrayal) is \"Drafting\", and its end is \"Adornment\". The context is not for elaborating on the statement of \"Abd al-Qahir\", but I wanted to indicate that Arrangement is a stage higher than the stage of \"Order\" in building meanings, and Order is the foundation of them all. Perhaps that is what made \"Abd al-Qahir\" apply it to all stations of relationships between words, for there is no stage except that Order exists in it. If \"Al-Biqa'i's\" expression here indicates that he sees the science of Proportion restricted to explaining the Rank between parts of speech, and Rank is one of the conditions of speech, implying a shortcoming in his stance, then the matter becomes more liberated by his saying about his work in explaining the Proportion between sentences and verses: That he \"prepares for every sentence a cradle indicating the condition that required its placement, and necessitated its arrangement on what preceded it of its form or what necessitated its emphasis or stripping and restriction, and the like of the arts of speech and styles of the system\" (3).",

Perhaps he wanted by what he did to draw insights to the status of \"Arrangement\" between passages and sections in the \"Science of Qur'anic Proportion\" and that it is not less in status in the rhetorical miraculousness of the Holy Qur'an than Composition in the field of the sentence. Perhaps he also indicates by restricting to the declaration of Arrangement in the definition to the higher level, because the \"Proportion\" which is the secret of the Qur'anic miracle depends on two types of systems for him, the second of which has what the first does not. *** Levels of Proportion. Qur'anic Proportion according to him consists of two types of systems, one higher than the other: {First: Compositional Order (Nazm Tarkibi)}: It is for him: \"The ordering of every sentence independently according to composition\" (2).

Arrangement for him does not occur in the construction of the sentence, even if the vocabulary extends. For him, vocabulary is not arranged but composed, to form a single sentence which is then arranged upon another. So everything that deals with the order of the sentence, even if extended, is for him composition. When you look at {Ayat al-Kursi}: the master of verses of the Holy Qur'an, you see that its order is a compositional order, not an ordinal one, because it is almost one rhetorical sentence, even if composed of ten consecutive grammatical sentences as follows: {Allah} - {there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence} - {Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep} - {To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth} - {Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission} - {He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them} - {and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills} - {His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth} - {and their preservation tires Him not} - {And He is the Most High, the Most Great} (Al-Baqarah: 255). The name of Majesty for him is a subject whose predicate is deleted, understood from the question extracted from the previous verses, which he estimated as: \"To whom does sovereignty belong today?\", so the answer comes (Allah). The sentences coming after are explanation and detail, so the connections between them are compositional relationships, not ordinal relationships between rhetorical sentences. Most of what the \"Science of Meanings\" (Ma'ani) deals with regarding the conditions of the subject and predicate and their attachments, and what the \"Science of Clarification\" (Bayan) and \"Science of Embellishment\" (Badi') deal with, most of this is from the Compositional Order according to \"Al-Biqa'i\".

And every time he looks closely at the meaning, the location of the miracle becomes greater for him.\" Many people, in the company of recalling the rules of the science of Arabic rhetoric which rhetoricians cared for in editing and application, feel within themselves the ability to speak about Compositional Order in sentence construction, so they think they have sailed into the dictionary of the rhetorical miraculousness of the Holy Qur'an, while they have not yet dipped the sole of their foot in the shore of the ocean with crashing waves. It can be said that \"Al-Biqa'i\" leaving the declaration of this Compositional Order in the definition of \"Science of Proportion\" - despite its importance to him - is a type of indicating the value of this system compared to the value of Ordinal Order for him, and this is a type of his method in evaluation and expressing it. {The Other: Ordinal Order (Nazm Tartibi)}: It is for him: \"The ordering of every sentence with its sister with regard to arrangement.\" It is a system that does not deal with rhetorical characteristics except the relationships of sentences to one another, and among that is what rhetoricians call \"Disjunction and Conjunction\" (Fasl and Wasl), and relationships of passages and Surahs to one another. These are relationships that look at the stations of sentences, passages, and Surahs relative to each other. From the relationships of stations, the escalation of the statement embracing the escalation of meanings is achieved. This system is the main pillar of Proportion for \"Al-Biqa'i\", and its task is building the product of Compositional Order into an integrated, brotherly, harmonious structure so that every element of this integrated structure holds the belt of some of it. Holding the belt is not of the type of partial linking between elements of the statement, but of the type of essential attachment between sentences, passages, and Surahs in the entire Holy Qur'an. *** He holds that the Holy Qur'an is miraculous in all its rhetorical components:",

He says: \"As for the side of vocabulary, it is due to them being the ultimate in majesty of words, elegance of letters, and gathering of meanings, which benefits that no other word can take the place of a word from it at all. As for the side of composition, it is due to every word of it being more rightful in its place such that if anything of it were advanced or delayed, the intended meaning in that context would be disturbed according to that station. As for the side of arrangement in sentences, verses, and stories in beginnings and ends, it is because the likeness of the composition of words: every sentence is organized with what precedes it like the organization of a unique pearl in a tightly strung necklace; because it is either a cause for what followed it, or a proof, or complementary in a face of the faces superior in a manner forbidden to approach, majestic in veil; to be sweeter in his mouth, and clearer after his taste in his ordering and all his knowledge\" (1). So his school does not stop him at the building of a sentence from words, nor the building of a verse from sentences, even if the verse reaches a great length, but goes beyond it to the building of the passage from verses, the building of the Surah from passages, and the building of the entire Holy Qur'an from Surahs. The smallest unit of Ordinal Order which is the spirit of the statement for him is the complete sentence, and the largest unit is the Qur'anic Surah. The units in the Productive Compositional Order, the sentence, transform in their relationship to each other, like the units of building the word which are letters and vowels in building each other. It is clear that any change occurring to any unit (letter or vowel) in the building of the word affects the indication of the word, and its semantic capacity, a clear effect for some people, and hidden for others, but it is an existing effect differing in appearance and concealment relatively due to matters returning to the faculties of the receivers.",

In every unit formed from smaller units, there is a spirit dominating it. This spirit emanates from the relationships of the components to each other, and in the receiver's possession of awareness of this dominating spirit is what helps him to perfect understanding and improve contemplation. From here \"Al-Biqa'i\" goes to say that in every Surah there is a spirit dominating its statement, called: (The Greatest Objective). He says: \"Every Surah has one objective around which its beginning and end revolve, and it is evidenced within it\" (1). This universal Greatest Objective, knowing it benefits knowing the objective of all parts of the Surah (2). The science of \"Qur'anic Proportion\" for him \"proficiency in it depends on knowing the objective of the Surah sought in it (3)\". And due to the difference of objectives of Surahs, the orders of stories and their words change according to the style useful for indicating that objective (4). He also says: \"Through it, the secrets of repeated stories become clear, and that every Surah in which a story is repeated, is for a meaning claimed in that Surah evidenced by that story other than the meaning for which it was driven in the previous Surah. From here the words differed according to those purposes, and the orders changed by delaying, advancing, brevity, and elongation, while nothing of that contradicts the original meaning by which the story was formed\" (5). And he says: \"Whoever realizes the objective of it knows the proportion of its verses, stories, and all its parts\" (6).",

The important thing is that defining this universal Greatest Objective does not come haphazardly, nor does a person possess it from hasty readings of the Qur'anic Surah, but he does not possess its major features except after living with the Surah, and a profound striving to reside in it with his mind, heart, and spirit until it transforms into part of his internal existence or until it stands within him. The contemplator remains moving between contemplating the part and contemplating the whole, living in a circular oscillating movement, trying to interpret the Surah and contemplate it. \"Al-Biqa'i\" used to rotate in his contemplation analyzing words, sentences, verses, and passages in light of the major features of the Surah's Greatest Objective, until he ends up defining the precise features of that objective, then returns to contemplating the sentences, verses, and passages deeper than before in light of this precise definition of the precise features of the objective. We see \"Al-Biqa'i\" for example modifying his method and plan in contemplation when he advances in it. When he reaches Surah \"Saba\", he returns to what he previously did from the beginning of Surah \"Al-Fatihah\" until Surah \"Saba\" and re-examines it. Thus he establishes himself in a circular oscillating movement between the universal objective and the elements within the framework of the Qur'anic Surah, then in the entire Holy Qur'an, due to the vastness of the field of Proportion. If the two pillars of \"Proportion\" for him are \"Compositional Order\" and \"Ordinal Order\", and each of them depends on the other as you see in his saying: \"The intended by Arrangement are meanings majestic in description, wondrous in construction, high in matter, great in value, distant from the meanings of speech although they are taken from it.\" If this is so, then \"Al-Biqa'i\" goes to say that \"Ordinal Order\" requires its contemplator to possess rhetorical insight (Firasah) in his contemplation, because it is extremely hidden.",

Thus he gets from constriction and distress multiples of what he got from hearing of shaking and expansion. Perhaps that makes him doubt and shakes his faith, and displaces his certainty, and perhaps that stops many of the opponents from entering this religion\" (1). Let us overlook somewhat Al-Biqa'i's exaggeration regarding the effect of ignorance of some stations of \"Ordinal Order\" to conclude that \"Ordinal Order\" which represents the spirit of speech for him derives its high effect and difficulty of contemplation and perception from its concealment, comprehensiveness, and dominance over every element such that the contemplator requires a breadth of horizon, depth of understanding, insight, ability for faithful storage of rhetorical subtleties, and precise tracking of every partial movement, monitoring it with penetrating insight; to obtain the spirit holding every small, large, and stray matter after it surrendered its leadership to him. That is a difficult matter to practice, and hence it was exciting for pleasure and enjoyment in us. ***** He adopts a methodology in his contemplation of the miraculous Qur'anic proportion. This methodology has universal features; I see a need to explain some of them, and my explanation of some of these features will not fulfill the right of revealing and explaining much of what exists in Al-Biqa'i's interpretation. *** If what passed was an explanation of the concept of Proportion for Al-Biqa'i, its levels, and fields in which it is realized, then Al-Biqa'i adopts this as a basis for the methodology of interpreting the rhetoric of the miraculous Qur'anic statement with its hidden contents and components: meaning and structure. This methodology has numerous traits and features; I preferred to summarize the speech on the most important of them, and to follow every feature with some of his interpretation so that what my explanation could not clarify becomes clear from it.

For every Surah is revealed in its wise position which has no other due to what its greatest objective required and what universal and partial meanings of guidance descended from it, realizing for the Surah its escalation in its arrangement and the generation of its objectives and meanings. This type is seen in the first four features, and I made them the First Chapter of this section. The attention of many exegetes to this type is little compared to its status in the rhetorical miraculousness of the Holy Qur'an, and its status in jurisprudence and understanding. Al-Biqa'i's attention to this type is distinct from the attention of his peers and teachers, which gives his interpretation (Nazm al-Durar) a place where you can be certain that no other rivals him. His methodology in contemplating this type is distinct from the methodology of his predecessors and successors who spoke about the occasions of Surahs. The coming papers will reveal to you - God willing - some of the features of this distinction in Al-Biqa'i's methodology in his interpreting the rhetoric of the Holy Qur'an in the proportion of its Surahs. {The Other Type}: Features of interpreting the construction of the Qur'anic Surah, the escalation of its universal and partial meanings, and their generation from a universal greatest objective. This you see in the rest of the features I summarized the speech on, and I made it the Second Chapter of this section. This type is the combiner of the two types of Order for Al-Biqa'i: Compositional Order and Ordinal Order. If the paths of Compositional Order are numerous and hardly encompassed as you see in Arabic rhetoric sciences, then the paths of Ordinal Order are more burdensome on the traveler in understanding and contemplation, and simpler in field and further in range, which necessitates upon the one undertaking to understand them to take provision, and the best provision is piety (Taqwa) and perfecting the work.",

Every book of value in human expression has a goal to which the statement is driven and a greatest objective aimed at. The most deserving of books for that is what is a statement from Allah Almighty to His servants; rather, its favor in this over servants' books is like the favor of Allah Almighty over His servants. The most deserving of Allah's books entirely for this is His Noble Book revealed to His servant, Prophet, and Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. It is the Seal Book revealed to the Seal Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to the best nation brought out for people. It is the Book whose statement He made a miracle of the One who revealed it, while no book before it had its statement made a miracle of the One who revealed it. So it was worthy that everything in it be of the miraculousness that silences all worlds. \"Al-Biqa'i\" explains in his interpretation of Surah \"Al-Fatihah\" and his clarification of its greatest objective: \"That the purpose of sending Messengers and revealing Books is establishing laws, and the purpose of establishing laws is gathering creation on the Truth, and the purpose of gathering them is introducing them to the King and what pleases Him.

Rather, it decided that for us in many verses. For the Holy Qur'an has a speech about itself unlike the speech of anyone in the worlds. Whoever wants to know the reality of the Holy Qur'an, its message, status, and virtue, has only to gather in his hearing, sight, and heart the verses that speak about the Holy Qur'an, and arrange them recalling their contexts in which they stand in their Surahs. For in this is a revelation. The best speech about the Holy Qur'an is the speech of the Glorious Qur'an itself, then after it the speech of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace. It is beautiful for someone to intend to gather the two speeches: the speech of the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah about the Great Qur'an in a vessel of analytical interpretive research. From the mercy of Allah, Majestic is His Glory, or His Rahmaniyyah (attribute of being All-Merciful), is that if He opens the Surah (Mother of the Book: Al-Fatihah) by speaking about Himself announcing His deserving of Praise, and teaching His servants how to praise Him, highlighting for them five of His Beautiful Names: the Name of the Essence and four attributes of His High Perfection: Allah - Lord of the Worlds, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Master of the Day of Judgment; then He, Majestic is His Glory, opens the first detailing of {The Mother of the Book} with Surah {Al-Baqarah} initiating His statement by speaking about the Holy Qur'an: {That is the Book, no doubt in it, a guidance for the pious} (Al-Baqarah: 1-2). And if He, Majestic is His Glory, arranged His Name and Beautiful Attributes in a sequence indicating the greatness of their link and attachment, dispensing with a linguistic connector (conjunction), so they came consecutive without conjunction (Allah Lord of the Worlds the Most Gracious the Most Merciful Master of the Day of Judgment), then He, Glory be to Him and Exalted, also arranged His speech about the Great Qur'an in a sequence where descriptions followed one another in a manner having no place for a conjunction.

He announced that that Book of far status and high destiny is also far removed from being a place for doubt or deserving that a doubter doubts in it whose doubt stems from something in what he doubts. As for those who doubt in what has nothing tempting to doubt, but rather project the doubt fermenting in their chests onto what is the High One transcending such things, no attention is paid to the likes of them. As if in this is guidance and instruction to the Ummah not to pay attention to all that tongues throw about of sayings, but upon it is to verify and validate. This which His saying (No doubt) conveyed implies and alludes to what the statement came explicitly in the saying of Allah Almighty: {O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful} (Al-Hujurat: 6).",

Let him look at what he sees? And what does he end up with? He will not end up except at the reality of realities: that this [Book] revealed to the servant of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, is nothing but the Book of High Destiny like which there is no book, and that it is transcendant above having in it what is valid to be a place for doubt.

For such studies, if they adhered to scientific objectivity and adhered to principles of observation and scientific verification, the matter would not end except in submission and announcement that the Holy Qur'an is indeed the Perfect Book that none says except the Lord of the Worlds, Glory be to Him and Exalted. All there is to it is that those striving for such studies commit to being characterized by the morals of objective scholars. The Truth, Mighty and Majestic, announced after this that that Book, High, Transcendant above being a place for a doubter's doubt that anyone pays attention to, is indeed a book sent down to be a guidance for the pious. Everything that others were afflicted with - mentioned at the head of the meaning of Surah Al-Fatihah: the Maghdub 'alayhim (those who earned anger) and the Dallin (the astray) - the methodology of these two groups in searching for the Straight Path is the methodology worthy of being avoided (Taqwa), turning away from, and fleeing from.

The important thing is that in clarifying this objective, achieving it, defining it, and designating it is a standard for everyone who strived to interpret a word, sentence, verse, passage, or Surah from the Holy Qur'an: that in this interpretation of his, there should be what manifests the methodology of the Holy Qur'an in guiding to the Straight Path.

If the Glorious Qur'an has a Greatest Objective from which meanings generate, then Allah Almighty, from the overflow of His mercy, has made the Great Qur'an into Surahs varying in the number of their verses and length, and made every Surah from verses, and made the verses sentences.

Hence, Al-Biqa'i's care for contemplating the rhetoric of the proportion of the Holy Qur'anic statement was from several faces, the most general being the rhetoric of the arrangement of Surahs and the proportion of their location. It is a great matter upon which the methodology of contemplation and interpretation in Al-Biqa'i's Tafsir stands, and he does not abandon it in any place. We will point to other features descended from this universal feature, all aiming to establish the truth of the proportion of the Holy Qur'an in the arrangement of building its sentences, verses, passages, and Surahs. \"Al-Biqa'i\" states at the end of his introduction to his Tafsir \"that there is no full stop in the Book of Allah, nor at the end of Surah (Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind), rather it is connected, despite being the last of the Qur'an, to Al-Fatihah which is its beginning, like its connection to what is before it, or even stronger\" (1). He states when interpreting the saying of Allah, Majestic is His Glory: {And they said, \"Our hearts are wrapped.\" Rather, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe} (Al-Baqarah: 88) following \"Al-Haralli\" that: \"The beginning of this Surah organized the manifestation of the two Satanisms of Jinn and Mankind which the Qur'an concluded with in His saying: 'from the jinn and mankind' (An-Nas: 6) so its two ends connect, making it a seal with no beginning and no end, and Al-Fatihah encompasses it. It is not said: It is its beginning or its end. Therefore, some reciters deemed it necessary to connect so that no end becomes clear for it, as the Arab woman said when asked about her sons: 'They are like the continuous ring; it is not known where its two ends are' (2). This which he takes as a basis for his interpretation decrees that every face of interpretation for the Glorious Qur'anic statement in which the realization of the Greatest Objective of the Glorious Qur'an is not present, and does not proportionate with it, that face of interpretation is not from correctness in anything. This is an objective standard from the interpreted statement itself acting as a resort and reference for what might be disputed in interpretation among groups of scholars. The Second Feature ...

In his explanation of the objective of Surah \"Al-Baqarah\", he focuses on the meaning which is the basis of meanings descended from the meaning of Al-Fatihah, which is the summary of the meaning of the Great Qur'an: the meaning of Belief in the Unseen. He says: \"Its objective is establishing the evidence that the Book is guidance; to be followed in every condition, and the greatest thing it guides to is Belief in the Unseen, and its gathering point is Belief in the Hereafter, and its pivot is Belief in the Resurrection which the story of the Cow expressed, whose pivot is Belief in the Unseen.

This Belief in the Unseen is the foundation of every righteous, reforming deed, for there is no meaning at all for any righteous deed or belief in a religion if that is not established on the settlement of the meaning of Belief in the Unseen. There is no religion among religions that stands only on what all eyes see, all ears hear, and hands touch... Rather, the foundation of every religion embraced by anyone of the servants, whether that religion is false or true revealed by Divine Revelation from the sky, is Belief in the Unseen; because the foundation of religion is Belief in the existence and oneness of the Worshipped God. The Worshipped God is not fit to be witnessed and tangible, but must be Absolute Unseen, whose existence, oneness, perfection of majesty, beauty, dominance, mercy, etc., are witnessed by eyes [of insight] and insights. Hence, the objective of the first Surah of the detailing of the Mother of the Book (Al-Fatihah): Surah Al-Baqarah, was Guidance to Belief in the Unseen. This you see clearly in naming the Surah the Hump (Sanam), the Peak (Dhirwah), and the Tent (Fustat), for the Tent is a gatherer of what relates to it. If \"Al-Biqa'i\" comes to explain the Greatest Objective of Surah (Al-Imran), he elaborates the speech in this: he clarifies to us what appeared to him first in its interpretation, then when he reviewed and exaggerated contemplation, the definition of its objective became clear to him in another way. He elaborates the speech, explaining the relationship of the objective of Surah (Al-Imran) to the objective of Surah (Al-Baqarah) and their objective together to the objective of Surah (Al-Fatihah), rather he extends the view further to the objective of Surah (An-Nisa).",

    "text": "He says: \"The objectives for which this Surah was driven are establishing Oneness (Tawhid) for Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted, and informing that worldly leadership through wealth and children and other things which the disbelievers preferred over Islam does not avail them anything in this world nor in the Hereafter, and that what is prepared for the pious of Paradise and Good Pleasure is what should be approached and hastened to. And in describing the pious with faith, supplication, patience, truthfulness, devotion, spending, and seeking forgiveness is what many arts of the styles of this Surah incline towards. This is what appeared to me first. Better than it is that we single out the First Intent, which is Tawhid, as the intent in it, for the last two matters return to it. That is because the description of Qayyumiyyah (Self-subsisting/Sustaining) necessitates standing with uprightness (Istiqamah). Standing is over every soul, and uprightness is justice... This aspect is more consistent with the arrangement, because Al-Fatihah, since it was comprehensive of religion in general, what details it came parallel to that. So it started with the Surah of the Book [Al-Baqarah] encompassing the matter of religion, then with the Surah of Tawhid [Al-Imran] which is the secret of the letter 'Al-Hamd', and the first letters of Al-Fatihah, because Tawhid is the matter upon which no building stands except on it. When the path was correct, and the foundation was firm, came the one after it [An-Nisa] calling for the gathering on that. Also, when the matter of the Book was established in Al-Baqarah that it is guidance, and the five pillars of Islam were established by it, this one [Al-Imran] came to establish the Comprehensive Call in His saying, Glory be to Him, (O Mankind, worship your Lord) (Al-Baqarah: 21). So it established Oneness for Allah Almighty by refuting the divinity of other than Him by proving that 'Jesus', peace be upon him, who used to revive the dead, is His servant, so other than him [is servant] by priority. When it was established that all are His servants, Surah 'An-Nisa' called for their turning to Him and gathering upon Him.",

It is the Crown which is the tangible property of the King, just as Tawhid is His intellectual property. And Tawhid necessitates the radiance (Zahrah) of the one adorned with it, that is why it was named Az-Zahra' (The Radiant)\" (1). This Oneness is the second brick in the foundation of Faith; because if it is established that the God must be Unseen, not viewed or touched, then He must also be One, nothing is like Him. Just as it contradicts the meaning of Divinity for the God to be witnessed, viewed, and tangible, it also contradicts the meaning of Divinity for the God to be not one; because this results in the corruption of the universe and life, a corruption decided by the logic of the sound mind free from error. The connection between Surah \"Al-Baqarah\" and Surah \"Al-Imran\" is a great connection; because they stand on one matter which is establishing what is essential in the meaning of Divinity and what must be a great foundation of the foundations of the attributes of the God worshipped by right: to be Unseen not perceived by eyes, and to be One, there is nothing like Him. This is like coupling the specific to the general. This connection is seen clearly in what the Noble Prophetic Sunnah brought regarding the virtue of these two Surahs. \"Muslim\" narrated in his Sahih in the Book: Prayer of Travelers: Chapter: Virtue of Reading the Qur'an and Surah Al-Baqarah, with his chain from Abu Umamah Al-Bahili, may Allah be pleased with him, that he heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, say: \"Read the Qur'an, for it comes on the Day of Resurrection as an intercessor for its companions.",

Read Surah Al-Baqarah, for taking it is a blessing, leaving it is regret, and the sorcerers cannot withstand it\" (Hadith No: 252/804). This indicates a majestic indication of the proportion, brotherhood, procreation, and harmony between these two Surahs. Al-Biqa'i, as you heard, did not suffice with explaining the connection of the objective of Surah (Al-Imran) to the objective of Surah (Al-Baqarah), but he extends the view to the relationship of the objective of Surah (An-Nisa) to what is before it. In the opening of his interpretation of Surah \"An-Nisa\", he clarifies what establishes knowledge and confirms that its objective is built upon the objective of \"Al-Imran\" built upon the objective of Surah \"Al-Baqarah\", saying: \"Its objective: Gathering on the Tawhid to which 'Al-Imran' guided, and the Book to which 'Al-Baqarah' urged; for the sake of the religion which 'Al-Fatihah' gathered, warning against what 'Shas bin Qais' and his peers intended of division\" (1). When you look at the rulings and etiquettes that Surah \"An-Nisa\" established, you see they are rulings and etiquettes realizing for the society adopting them its unity on the basis of religion: \"Tawhid\". This basis, if the relationships of any society are established upon it such that its movement is linked to the certainty that there is no god for this universe except One God, One Creator, One Owner, One Bestower, One Withholder... you will not see in this society what you see in other societies that do not base their religion on pure Tawhid. Al-Biqa'i's interpretation and clarification of the Greatest Objective of Surah \"Al-Ma'idah\" comes, and it does not depart from that methodology. He says: \"Its objective is fulfilling what the Book guided to, and what the covenant of reason indicated of the Oneness of the Creator and mercy for creation, in gratitude for His blessings and seeking removal of His vengeance\" (2). He says in Surah \"Al-An'am\":",

    "text": "\"Its objective: Providing evidence for what the Book called for in the past Surah regarding Tawhid, that He encompasses all perfections of creating, annihilating, power of resurrection, and others.\" He also says after interpreting the beginning of the Surah: ... \"It appeared that the objective of the Surah is providing evidence for what the Book called for - which was clarified to be the Guidance - of Tawhid of Allah Almighty, gathering upon it, and fulfilling His covenants that He Almighty alone is the Creator possessing all perfections of the power of resurrection and others\" (1). He thus shows you the existence of the objective of \"An-Nisa\", \"Al-Imran\", and \"Al-Baqarah\" in the objective of Surah \"Al-Ma'idah\" and the existence of the objective of all those in the objective of Surah \"Al-An'am\". And when you look at Al-Biqa'i's statement at the beginning of Surah \"Al-A'raf\", you see him explaining its objective establishing its structure on what the Surahs preceding it established, starting from Surah \"Al-Baqarah\" and what it stood upon of the call of the Book whose statement opened by pointing to its great value: {That is the Book, no doubt in it, guidance for the pious}, and what Surah \"Al-Imran\" stood upon of establishing the meaning of Tawhid, and what Surah \"An-Nisa\" stood upon of establishing the call to gathering on Good, and what Surah \"Al-Ma'idah\" stood upon of the call to fulfilling contracts, and what Surah \"Al-An'am\" stood upon of providing evidence for what preceded the establishment of previous Surahs (2). Thus the objectives of Surahs generate from one another, a generation standing on two majestic matters: First: Founding a meaning that was not founded in the one before it. And Second: Confirming what was previously founded. In every confirmation there is a founding from another aspect. Confirmation is not by repetition but by rhetorical variation in portraying meanings. That is because the Holy Qur'an does not proceed on the method of sterile repetition whose result is restating the statement in component and content. It is impossible for an important element of the statement which has a majestic effect in portraying the meaning to repeat.",

That context is protected from copying; it is like the surge of a wave in the context of the water of the teeming ocean, never repeating. Al-Biqa'i looks at the Total Context of the Qur'anic Meaning, seeing that it consists of stations and stages with numerous faces. Among those faces is looking at the statement of Allah Almighty about the Holy Qur'an, its status, and its objective. \"Al-Biqa'i\" looked into this statement and saw that the detailing of the Mother of the Book started with Al-Baqarah initiating its statement about the Holy Qur'an {That is the Book, no doubt in it, a guidance for the pious}.

The story of Luqman, by which the Surah is named, is clear evidence for that. As if He, Glory be to Him and Exalted, when He completed what He wanted from the beginning of the Qur'an to the end of 'Bara'ah' which is the Surah of the Roman invasion, and He, Glory be to Him and Exalted, had started the Qur'an after 'Mother of the Qur'an' by negating Doubt from this Book and that it is guidance for the pious and provided evidence for that in the Surahs following it, then He started Surah 'Yunus' after the Surah of the Roman invasion by proving His Wisdom, and followed that with its evidence until He concluded Surah Ar-Rum, He started a new cycle in a more massive way than the first. He described it at the beginning of this one following Ar-Rum with what He described it in 'Yunus' following the Roman invasion, and that description is Wisdom, and added that it is guidance and mercy for the doers of good (Muhsinin), for these are people of Endings, and the pious (Muttaqin) are people of Beginnings. And when He proved in 'Al-Imran' [following Al-Baqarah which is the first of the First Stage] that it was sent down with Truth, He proved in 'As-Sajdah' [following Luqman which is the first of the Third Stage] its revelation and negation of doubt that it is from Him Almighty and proved that it is the Truth.

This becomes increasingly founded and established in the two features coming after. The Third Feature. Relationship of the opening of every Surah with the conclusion of the one before it. Every Surah has a beginning of recitation and an end of chanting. The station of the beginning in indicating its objective and content, and the station of the end in dedicating its meanings and condensing its contents will become clear to us. \"Al-Biqa'i\" pays attention to interpreting the relationship of the opening of the Surah to the conclusion of the one before it, just as he paid attention to interpreting the relationship of the objectives of Surahs to each other, so that the Proportion between Surahs has numerous causes and manifests in many appearances. Our saying \"opening\" of the Surah, or its Fatihah, and \"conclusion\" of the Surah or its Khatimah does not mean that its opening is disconnected from the one preceding it. The term here does not look at the relationships of the meanings of Surahs, but looks at the matter of recitation and chanting. The important thing is that \"Al-Biqa'i\" does not restrict his method to linking the first verse of the Surah with the last verse of the one before it only. Rather, the beginning of the Surah for him is its key and the treasure of its objective. Linking its beginning to the end of the one before it, which represents the good conclusion returning to its beginning, is in reality linking an objective to an objective. So his action here is not linking particulars with particulars but linking a universal content of a Surah to a universal content of another preceding it. This is a type of methodological conduct by Al-Biqa'i in establishing the truth he arrived at. He says regarding Surah \"Al-Ma'idah\" following Surah \"An-Nisa\": \"When He Almighty informed at the end of Surah 'An-Nisa' that the Jews, when they broke the covenants He took from them, He forbade them good things permitted to them from much of the livestock animals indicated by His saying:",

And He Almighty continued tearing their veils and exposing their flaws until He concluded with a verse on Inheritance, which He opened its verses by willing (commanding) and concluded them by saying He is All-Encompassing in Knowledge. It suited the opening of this one with the command to the Believers - whom He severely warned against them - to fulfill (contracts) whose basis is the heart which is Unseen. So He said, indicating that the people addressed in the beginning of that one were qualified for the first ages of Faith (2) and described with what they needed. Singling them out indicates that those above them in ages (3) have firmness that suffices them from being loaded with the command, and that is more inciting for him to contemplate and comply (O you who have believed) (Al-Ma'idah: 1) meaning they claimed that with their tongues (fulfill) meaning verify that by fulfilling (the contracts) (4). This is a look at the head of the meaning in Surah \"An-Nisa\" and how it is like a cradle for what is the origin of the meaning in Surah \"Al-Ma'idah\". In Surah \"An-Nisa\" there is preparation by addressing those who were in a degree where they were not qualified for the call by \"O you who have believed\", as was the opening of \"Al-Ma'idah\", rather the call to them was \"O Mankind\", and this is the lowest degree of address, and the most general.",

While those with you, I made them only an apparent instrument, yet they ask (about the spoils) which I entrusted you with by the hands of my soldiers, a question of dispute which one should seek refuge in Allah from - as warned against by the end of Al-A'raf - because that leads to the division of the word and weakness in resisting enemies\" (1). You see him not stopping in the link at the last verse of the previous Surah but looking at the concluding passage, so the consideration is not by the last sentence of the Surah but by the sentence which is the mother of the seal, even if numerous sentences came after it.",

And he might extend his contemplation of the relationship of the Surah's opening to a Surah before it, not restricting it to the one immediately preceding it, as you see him acting in Surah \"Yunus\", saying: \"When He presented in the beginning of Al-A'raf the incitement to convey advice via this Book and finished what the context required of warning against the likes of the events of the ancients and the demises of the past peoples, and what followed that of connecting the speech regarding the biography of this Noble Prophet, peace be upon him, with his people in his commands, during it, and its end in Surahs 'Al-Anfal' and 'Bara'ah', and concluded that by stating that the Surahs of the Book increase everyone in what is suitable for him making him ready to accept it and distance him from what is repugnant to him far from accepting its suitability, and that the Messenger, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, by that has contained descriptions, ornaments, and high morals necessitating turning to him and hastening to him, and informing that turning away from him does not harm him at all; because his Lord Almighty suffices him; and because there is nothing like Him, and He is the Owner of the Great Throne. When that was so, He Almighty repeated the speech regarding the matter of the Book with which He opened 'Al-A'raf' and concluded Surah At-Tawbah, and added to it the description of Wisdom, and pointed with the tool of distance to the fact that its rank in it is far to reach, wondrous in example, saying: 'These'...

It is built upon the belief that the arrangement of Surahs in the recitation context which is between the two covers of the Mushaf upon which the whole Ummah is, is a manifestation of its rhetorical miraculousness, and that its miraculous proportion is not restricted to the proportion of its Compositional Order represented in the building of the sentence, but is also realized to perfection in its Ordinal Order represented in the relationships of sentences to each other in building the passage, the relationships of passages to each other in building the Surah, and the relationships of Surahs to each other in building the entire Great Qur'anic statement opening with Surah \"Al-Fatihah\" and concluding with Surah \"An-Nas\". *** Critique of the view that the arrangement of Surahs is Ijtihad. \"Al-Biqa'i\" declares in the opening of his interpretation of Surah \"Al-Imran\" the opinion of \"Abu al-Hasan al-Haralli\" represented in that the arrangement of some Surahs as it is before us between the two covers of the Mushaf is a Tawfiq (Divinely ordained/guided): \"Al-Haralli said, pointing to the correct opinion regarding the arrangement of Surahs that it is by the Ijtihad of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, as a confirmation by Allah Almighty for this organization and Surah arrangement in the established text of this Book: it is what Allah Almighty was pleased with and confirmed...\" (1). Al-Biqa'i, as you see here, declares the correctness of the saying that the arrangement of Surahs is by the Ijtihad of the Companions. Perhaps Al-Haralli and Al-Biqa'i after him, and a group of scholars before them, in their going to the saying of Ijtihad from the Companions in arranging some Surahs, their resort or proof is what was narrated from the Hadith of \"Yazid al-Farisi\" from \"Ibn Abbas\", may Allah be pleased with them.",

So when something was revealed to him, he would call some of those who used to write and say: Put these verses in the Surah in which such and such is mentioned. And if a verse was revealed to him, he would say: Put this verse in the Surah in which such and such is mentioned. Al-Anfal was among the first of what was revealed in Medina, and Bara'ah was from the last of the Qur'an, and its story was similar to its story, so I thought it was part of it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, died and did not clarify to us that it was part of it. So for that reason, I joined them and did not write the line {In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful} between them, and placed them in the Seven Long Ones.\" Abu Isa said this is a Hasan Hadith... We do not know it except from the Hadith of Awf from Yazid al-Farisi from Ibn Abbas. Yazid al-Farisi narrated other than this Hadith from Ibn Abbas. It is said he is Yazid bin Hormuz. Yazid al-Raqashi is Yazid bin Aban al-Raqashi and he did not meet Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him; he only narrated from Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him. Both are from the people of Basra, and Yazid al-Farisi is older than Yazid al-Raqashi. (Al-Jami' as-Sahih by Abu Isa At-Tirmidhi: Book: Interpretation of the Qur'an - Surah At-Tawbah - Hadith: 3086).

So if this is the state of the one who was unique in narrating this Hadith, how can it be thought that it can be accepted regarding what is in it, especially in a matter related to the delivery of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace? How can a calculator calculate that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, could leave informing the Companions of something from the Holy Qur'an, even if that thing was regarding the arrangement of the Qur'an's Surahs? Indeed, in inferring with this Hadith, there is what does not reassure one to say it or prefer what is in it or assume it. I am not rejecting this inference because it is an inference by a Ahad Hadith, but because its narrator: \"Yazid al-Farisi\" is not of that standing, and if he were of status with the Imams, we would be the first to submit. The strange thing is that \"Al-Haralli\" says in the opinion I mentioned to you before \"that it is by the Ijtihad of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, as a confirmation by Allah Almighty for this organization and Surah arrangement...\" So we do not know how that confirmation was?

So the outcome of the matter is that it is a Prophetic Sunnah whose path is confirmation. What \"Al-Haralli\" says regarding Allah's confirmation of the Companions' Ijtihad in arranging the Qur'an's Surahs is a matter existing according to his claim after the cessation of Revelation. So how was the knowledge of Allah's confirmation of what happened of the Companions' Ijtihad in this obtained? If \"Al-Haralli\" meant by his saying \"by the Ijtihad of the Companions\" their Ijtihad in arranging it by gathering it between the two covers of the Mushaf just as it was gathered in the chest of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, then the chests of his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, it would be an undeniable matter to us... But that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, moved to the Supreme Companion while the Companions did not have the arrangement of the Wise Qur'an's Surahs in their chests according to the manner existing between the two covers of the Mushaf before us, this is the matter rejected by us. And when you follow \"Al-Biqa'i\" in his Tafsir, you find him stating in places of it what indicates clearly that the arrangement of Surahs is a manifestation of His miraculousness which is from its Revealer, Majestic is His Glory. In the opening of his interpretation of Surah \"An-Nisa\", he establishes that it is among the last of what was revealed, and mentions what Al-Bukhari narrated in the Virtues of the Qur'an in his Sahih that an Iraqi asked the Mother of the Believers \"Aisha\" the Truthful, may Allah be pleased with her, saying: \"Which shroud is best?

If the first thing revealed was: Do not drink wine, they would have said: We will never leave wine. And if it was revealed: Do not commit adultery, they would have said: We will never leave adultery.

His comment is based on the fact that the Mother of the Believers pointed to two matters: First: Observing the condition of the Ummah at the time of revelation, so the revelation was like medicine for the maladies that occurred, so it was a revelation conforming to the condition of the Ummah and the reality of its movement in founding the Muslim Ummah. And the Other: Observing the condition of meaning and rhetorical miraculousness, so every verse descends in the context of its recitation in its position realizing for it the perfection of its rhetorical miraculousness by what it produces with what is before it and what is after it of meanings of guidance to the Straight Path.

But what can happen is that a Muslim reads a Surah before another Surah. And the answer of the Mother of the Believers, may Allah be pleased with her, indicates that she guided him that no harm, any harm that removes him from the station of obedience to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, or confuses for him the understanding of the Majority Faith Meaning, befalls him if he read a Surah before another Surah, even if the delayed one was prior in the order of revelation or the order of recitation. For the meanings taken from understanding the arrangement of Surahs are Ehsan meanings (excellence) rising above the Majority Faith meanings. So she said to him, may Allah be pleased with her: \"And what harms you which of it you read first\" meaning in the context of the arrangement of Surahs, not in the context of the arrangement of verses; because there is no doubt that if he read a verse before the one preceding it in the recitation sequence, a great harm would befall him in understanding the Majority Faith Meaning which is guidance for people. Then she said to him: \"Indeed, the first of it to be revealed was a Surah from the Mufassal in which Paradise and Hell are mentioned, until when people returned to Islam, the Halal and Haram were revealed\". This from her indicates clearly that the revelation was in accordance with what the methodology of psychological and spiritual education and culturing of the Ummah required, and taking the hands of people to what is easy for them, and escalating with them in the steps of obedience and closeness: \"If the first thing revealed was: Do not drink wine, they would have said: We will never leave wine.

    "text": "So if this was with regard to the condition of the Ummah before people returned to Islam and it became established in their hearts, then the matter requires observing the requirement of another condition other than that observed by the Revelation Order. But a matter remains, which is that \"The Iraqi\" asked about the composition of Surahs, not the composition of verses in the Surah, and the end of the report says: \"So she brought out the Mushaf for him, and dictated to him the verses of the Surah\" and in a narration (verses of the Surahs). The apparent requirement is that the report says: So she brought out the Mushaf for him, and dictated to him the composition of the Surahs, and not the verses of the Surah, for the composition of the verses of the Surah is not the object of questioning. So what is the explanation for this? \"Ibn Hajar\" says in Fath al-Bari: \"What appears to me is that this Iraqi was one of those who took by the reading of Ibn Mas'ud, and Ibn Mas'ud, when Uthman's Mushaf came to Kufa, did not agree to return from his reading nor to destroy his Mushaf... so the composition of his Mushaf was different from the composition of Uthman's Mushaf. There is no doubt that the composition of the Uthmani Mushaf is more appropriate than others, so for this reason the Iraqi stated that it is uncomposed. And this is all assuming the question occurred regarding the arrangement of Surahs. What indicates that is her saying to him: 'And what harms you which of it you read first'. And it is probable that he wanted the detailing of the verses of every Surah due to his saying at the end of the Hadith: So she dictated to him the verses of the Surahs' meaning the verses of every Surah, like saying Surah such-and-such for example has such-and-such verses, the first is such, the second... etc. And this goes back to the difference in the number of verses, and in it is a difference between the Madani, Shami, and Basri, and the Imams of Reciters took care to collect that and clarify the difference in it. And the first is more apparent. And it is probable that the question occurred regarding both matters, and Allah knows best\" (1). What \"Ibn Hajar\" said is not sufficient or healing.",

As if she indicates to the Iraqi that what is more appropriate for the likes of you is to be concerned with the composition of the verses of the Surah, for you or your likes are in more need of that than disputing with others regarding the composition of Surahs. And so that the Iraqi does not take her action as a cause for arguing or fighting those who take by the arrangement of the Mushaf of \"Ibn Mas'ud\" or the Mushaf of \"Ubayy bin Ka'b\", standing in the face of the other with a copy of the Mother of the Believers' Mushaf in his hand, and she is who she is, so the dispute intensifies. That is from her wisdom in warding off Fitnah and closing the door of argumentation in what does not befit the Ummah to dispute about, while it was concerned at that time with what is more important than that.

The clarification of that is in the report of 'Ibn Abbas' who said: 'I said to Uthman what made you proceed to Bara'ah which is from the Mi'un, and to Al-Anfal which is from the Mathani, so you joined them and did not make between them a line containing {In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful} and placed them in the Seven Long Ones? ...

It explains the reason for the delay in collecting it in that manner between the two covers of a Mushaf (written copy), and the reason the Companions undertook making its collection in the hearts during the time of Prophethood joined by its collection between two covers. Thus, the two collections served as documentation and verification, for fear that the first collection might vanish with the passing of the hearts (people) who collected it, when killing intensified against many of them during Jihad in the path of Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted. What the Companions did regarding the collection was no more than transcribing the collection existing in the hearts to be between the two covers of a Mushaf. This is similar to the scribes who copy a book from the master copy created, arranged, and composed by the book's author in the world of scholars; the scribe does nothing but transfer it from the master copy written by its author exactly as it is to other multiple copies. However, the master copy here regarding the Holy Qur'an was the hearts preserved by faith, and that which was within them of the Holy Qur'an was preserved by the protection of its Revealer, Glory be to Him and Exalted, upon His servant and Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace: {Indeed, it is We who sent down the Dhikr and indeed, We will be its guardian} (Al-Hijr: 9).",

    "text": "When you look at the rhetoric of this majestic verse, you do not find it consisting of a single sentence in which the subject is informed about by two predicates, the second conjoined to the first. Rather, it consists of two sentences, the second conjoined to the first. Each is built upon the emphasized subject indicated by the Royal 'We' (Inna - Indeed We), with its emphasis in the first [sentence]—which informs about Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted, exclusively sending it down—by His saying (Nahnu - We), unlike the second [sentence] which informs about Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted, specifically restricting His preservation to the Wise Dhikr (Quran). In each, there is exclusivity (Ikhtisas): In the first, He restricted the revelation to Himself, so no one else sent down the Holy Qur'an; this is restricting the Attribute to the Entity: restricting the revelation of the Holy Qur'an to Him, Glory be to Him and Exalted. In the other, He restricted His preservation, Exalted be He, to the Holy Qur'an; meaning, We did not guarantee the preservation of any book We sent down from the heavenly books except the preservation of the Wise Dhikr. That is, the restriction of His preservation is to its occurrence upon the Holy Qur'an to the exclusion of others. This follows the method of \"I listened to no one but Muhammad\"; it is restricting the Entity to the Attribute. Thus, two matters gathered for the Holy Qur'an: First, that no one sent it down except Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted. Second, that it is specifically singled out for Allah's preservation, Glory be to Him and Exalted, unlike other heavenly books preceding it which were afflicted with distortion at the hands of the followers of those to whom they were revealed.",

The Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, were instruments for confirming the preservation of that Book and its infallibility from distortion, alteration, addition, and subtraction. Whereas the nation of previous Prophets was a cause for distortion, alteration, and change through addition and subtraction. So look at the favor of Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted, upon the followers of His beloved Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace. This confirms the statement that the preservation of the Holy Qur'an from the slightest change by advancing or delaying a verse or a surah is indeed from Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted, and that the favor Allah conducted at the hands of the Companions of His servant, Prophet, and Messenger, our Master Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, was represented in making them instruments to manifest this preservation in another vessel joined to the previous vessel: preservation between the two covers [of the Mushaf] added to preservation in the hearts. The summary of the matter in this is: The arrangement of the Surahs between the two covers of the Mushaf in the manner that is before us, and which will remain so until the Hour, is exactly what existed in the heart of the Prophet, our Master Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, as revelation from Allah Almighty, and in the hearts of his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, receiving it from the Prophet, peace be upon him, and not by Ijtihad (independent reasoning). And that within this arrangement are signs of rhetorical miraculousness equal to what is in the composition of its verses in a single Surah, and even what is in the composition of the words of a single verse of great, majestic rhetorical miraculousness.",

    "text": "If this is what you heard from the opinion of \"Abu Sulaiman Al-Khattabi,\" then the author of the book \"Al-Mabani li Nazm al-Ma'ani\"—who is one of the scholars of the fourth and fifth centuries—goes in the introduction of his book in the third chapter to state that the Holy Qur'an, in the arrangement before us between the two covers of the Mushaf, is the same as that which is in the Preserved Tablet (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz), saying: \"As for the evidence that it is in the Preserved Tablet in this arrangement which is in our hands, and that He Almighty sent it down as a whole to the lowest heaven on the Night of Decree, then parts of it were sent down one after another according to need, it is the saying of Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted: {Indeed, upon Us is its collection and its recitation. * So when We have recited it, then follow its recitation. * Then upon Us is its clarification} (Al-Qiyamah: 17-19). This is the strongest evidence that Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted, took charge of its revelation, collection, and ordering, and sent it down upon the Chosen One, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, on the tongue of Gabriel, peace be upon him, and protected him from oversight, error, and alteration in it\" (1). Then he says: \"And indicated by the reports narrated from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, regarding naming the Surah 'Al-Hamdu lillahi Rabb al-'Alamin' as the Opening of the Book (Fatihat al-Kitab). Were it not that he, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, commanded the Companions to arrange this order by the command of 'Gabriel', peace be upon him, from 'Allah', Mighty and Majestic, his naming of this Surah as 'Opening of the Book' would have had no meaning, since it is established by consensus that this Surah is not the opening of the Qur'an's surahs in revelation. Thus, it is proven that it is its opening in order, arrangement, and speech\" (2). The Fourth Feature: Returning the end of the Holy Qur'an to its beginning.",

    "text": "Al-Biqa'i's interpretation of the Holy Qur'anic rhetoric is based on the premise that the parts of the Holy Qur'an are proportional in their rhetoric, whether a word, a Surah, or what is between them. Every part stands in its station based on the requirements of the context (Maqam), and that which is advanced is not advanced over the other while its meaning is separated from the meaning of what it was advanced over. Rather, the meanings of guidance in the Holy Qur'an reproduce from one another. You cannot say that such-and-such meaning is a beginning not preceded by meanings upon which it is built; rather, in the proportion and reproduction of its meanings, it is like a continuous ring whose ends are unknown. Therefore, in the introduction to his Tafsir, he declares that \"there is no complete stop in the Book of Allah Almighty, nor at the end of Surah {Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind} (Al-Nas); rather, it is connected—despite being the last of the Qur'an—to Al-Fatihah, which is its beginning, like its connection to what is before it, or even stronger\" (1). The purpose of detailing the Qur'an into verses and Surahs exists for \"Al-Biqa'i\" in \"that a thing, if it is a genus and types are made for it, and its types contain categories, it is better, more magnificent for its status, and nobler. Especially if the forms follow one another with wondrous organization, and analogues respond to one another with good cohesion, and likenesses embrace in similarity with perfect precision and beauty of rulings. That is also more invigorating for the reader, and greater for him when he takes from it a named portion of numbered verses, or known Surahs, and so on\" (2). This detailing into Surahs does not mean, as you heard, that Surah \"Al-Nas\" is its end where meanings of guidance in it do not fuse with meanings of guidance in the beginning of the Holy Qur'an. This primacy and finality in the arrangement of Surahs is primacy in the order of recitation, not primacy in the separation of meaning. It possesses a circular context that has no beginning that does not fuse with something, nor an end where it cuts off. Hence, the Prophetic incitement for the reciter of the Holy Qur'an was to be the \"Hal Al-Murtahil\" (The one who alights and departs).",

    "text": "\"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, was asked: 'Which deed is best?' He said: 'The Hal Al-Murtahil (The one who alights and departs).' It was said: 'What is the Hal Al-Murtahil?' He said: 'The companion of the Qur'an who travels from the beginning of the Qur'an to its end, and from its end to its beginning; whenever he alights (finishes), he departs (starts again)'\" (Sunan Al-Darimi: Virtues of the Quran). Thus, \"Al-Biqa'i\" sought to return (link) nine surahs from the end of the Holy Qur'an to nine surahs from its beginning. By this, he exceeds with the style of \"returning the end to the beginning\" (Radd al-'ajuz 'ala al-sadr) what rhetoricians hold, making it encompass the structure of the Surah, nay, the structure of the entire Holy Qur'an. At the conclusion of Surah \"Quraysh\", he begins looking at returning nine surahs from the end of the Holy Qur'an in recitation to nine surahs from its beginning in order, saying: ((Just as the end of every Surah met its beginning, so too the end of the Great Qur'an met its beginning regarding nine surahs; this is the first of them if you count from the end towards it. For its summary is the favor upon \"Quraysh\" by aiding in trade, harmonizing them for travel in it, and striking in the earth because of it, and specifying Him with the command to worship the One who favored them with the Sacred House and brought them provisions and security through it. Among the greatest objectives of [Surah] At-Tawbah, which corresponds to it as the ninth from the beginning, is the disavowal (Bara'ah) of every renegade, and that doing so is a cause for unity after it was thought to be a cause for division, and mentioning the virtues of the House and who is fit to serve it, and winning its security and blessing, and the glad tidings of wealth in a manner greater than acquiring it through trade—more splendid, dazzling, fulfilling, abundant, radiant, blooming, majestic, and proud—by His saying Almighty: {It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah [while] witnessing against themselves with disbelief. For those, their deeds have become worthless, and in the Fire they will abide eternally} (At-Tawbah: 17) and His saying Almighty: {And if you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you from His bounty if He wills. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Wise} (At-Tawbah: from Verse 28).",

Among the greatest correlations in that is that the beginning of the Surah in which He started returning the segment to the opening is strongly similar to the Surah corresponding to it, such that each of them with the one before it is like a single Surah. For Bara'ah with Al-Anfal is like that, to the extent that \"Uthman\", may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, passed away without clarifying its matter, so it was not established for him that it was independent from it; therefore, he did not write the line {In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful} between them.\" Whereas this one from the end [Quraysh] is decisively independent, along with what was reported of it being with the one before it [Al-Fil] as a single Surah in the Mushaf of \"Ubayy\", may Allah be pleased with him, and the recitation of \"Umar\", may Allah be pleased with him, of them in a way that suggests that, as passed, indicating that the latter is clearer than the former. Among the strangest of that is that the two Surahs preceding the two corresponding Surahs have an antithesis (Tibaq) between their matters. The first in the end, which is \"Al-Fil\", Allah, Glory be to Him and Exalted, honored Quraysh in it by destroying the People of the \"Gospel\" [Abrahah's army]. The first in the beginning, which is \"Al-Anfal\", Allah, Majestic is His Glory, honored them [the Believers] in it by giving victory to the People of the Qur'an over them [Quraysh] by destroying their tyrants. That was a cause for breaking their power and the fall of their pride leading to their happiness. And it was known that the Disavowal (Bara'ah) and others were only done to honor them; because they are intended essentially and by primary intent in the Message, and people are followers to them, just as all Messengers are followers to the Opening and Sealing Messenger...))

He continues clarifying the connection of each of the nine surahs at the end of the Holy Qur'an in recitation with the corresponding one of the nine at its beginning in reading. Among what is clear and undeniable, showing no taint of forced interpretation, is what you see of the close relationship between Surah \"Al-Masad\" [111], the fourth from the end of its recitation, and Surah \"An-Nisa\" [4], the fourth from the beginning of its recitation. He says in the conclusion of interpreting Surah \"Al-Masad\": \"The summary of this Surah is that Abu Lahab severed his kinship ties, deviated from the intended path, strove after his misguidance to misguide others, and wronged the One advising him and compassionate towards him, who spared no effort in advising him despite what you see of him sparing no effort in harming him. He relied on his wealth and earnings, so he perished and destroyed his wife with him, and whoever followed him of his children. Among the greatest objectives of Surah 'An-Nisa', corresponding to it in returning the segment to the opening, is connection, closeness, and benevolence, especially to kin, and justice in all sayings and deeds. Thus, the explanation of the state of the Advisor who does not speak from desire, and the state of the misguided one who only speaks from desire, was His saying Almighty: {Allah wants to make clear to you and guide you to the [good] practices of those before you} (An-Nisa: 26). He concluded it pointing to the warning against a state like his [Abu Lahab's]. As if it was said: Allah clarifies to you lest you go astray and become like Abu Lahab in ruin and roasting in the Fire, as He clarified to you. So be cautious of everything resembling his state, even if the contrary appears to you, for I am more knowledgeable than you, and Allah is Knowing of all things. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds)) (1). This which \"Al-Biqa'i\" showed regarding the embrace of Surahs \"Al-Masad\" and \"An-Nisa\" shows no taint of artificiality; once he draws your insight to it, you find repose in what he drew you to.",

    "text": "Here he offers us guidance to extend the field of rhetorical study of styles, so we do not restrict them to the construction of a sentence or verse, but extend beyond that to the construction of a passage (Ma'qid) or Surah, or even the entire Holy Qur'an. Antithesis (Tibaq) extends from the opposition between two words in the structure of a sentence, or two sentences in the structure of a verse or line of poetry, to making it a contrast between a story and a story, similar to what exegetes and rhetoricians knew of conjoining a story to a story, and we extend it to make it a contrast between a Surah and a Surah. Thus, we have singular Tibaq, multiple Tibaq, and complex universal Tibaq. Rhetoricians had a similar view regarding Simile (Tashbih), but they did not do so regarding Tibaq, though it is worthy of it. Likewise, \"Exportation\" (Tasdir - Epanadiplosis): we extend it from returning the end to the beginning in the structure of a poetic line to the structure of a section in a poem and returning the end of the poem to its opening. In the Qur'anic statement, we extend it to returning the end of the Surah to its opening, and returning the final segment of the Holy Qur'an in recitation to its opening. Similar things can be done in styles of advancing and delaying, omission, disjunction, and conjunction. In summary, this action of \"Al-Biqa'i\" indicates that he holds that the arrangement of the Surahs of the Great Qur'an contains secrets of rhetorical miraculousness, and that it is not [only] miraculous in the order of its sentence or verse structures, but in the arrangement of its verses and Surahs. If a group of modern rhetoricians directed their attention to fulfilling some of the rights of this chapter through contemplation, pondering, and deriving the principles of its rhetoric in the Holy Qur'an, we would be able to establish, alongside what the predecessors established, what satisfies Allah Almighty from us as being part of giving advice (Nasihah) to His Noble Book.",

    "text": "Chapter Two: His Methodology in Interpreting the Rhetoric of the Holy Qur'an in the Construction of the Surah. First Feature... Realizing the Objective of Each Surah and the Escalation of its Meanings. The previous features were related to \"Al-Biqa'i's\" methodology in interpreting the proportion of the arrangement of Qur'anic Surahs. The features coming to you are established to clarify his methodology in interpreting the proportion of Compositional Order (Nazm Tarkibi) and Ordinal Order (Nazm Tartibi) in the construction of the Qur'anic Surah. The basis of his methodology in this is his care for verifying and liberating the Greatest Objective of the Qur'anic Surah which he is interpreting and demonstrating the rhetorical miraculousness in its order, compositionally and ordinally. The Greatest Objective is what the meanings of the statement in this Surah revolve around, and it is what controls everything in it. He states in the introduction of his Tafsir (Nazm al-Durar) that the science of Appropriateness (Munasabat) of the Holy Qur'an is a science by which the reasons for the arrangement of its parts (i.e., parts of the Qur'an: its sentences, verses, passages, and Surahs) are known, and it is the secret of rhetoric; because it leads to achieving the conformity of meanings to what the context requires. This means he does not see that the secret of Qur'anic rhetoric lies only in the Compositional Order realized from the relationships of words to each other in the construction of a sentence isolated from its indicators in its context, even if extended. Rather, it lies in the Ordinal Order. The high miraculous rhetoric is not in defining this word to convey such meaning, or advancing it to convey such, or deleting the subject or object to convey such meaning; for you can find something of that in the construction of a sentence isolated from its indicators in its context in other than the Qur'anic statement. But the high miraculous rhetoric that silences all worlds lies in the relationships of sentences to each other in the context of the verse, relationships of verses to each other in the context of the passage, relationships of passages to each other in the context of the Surah, and relationships of Surahs to each other in the total context of the Holy Qur'anic meaning. Al-Biqa'i also explains in the introduction of his Tafsir what mastering understanding this and perfecting the interpretation of miraculous Qur'anic rhetoric depends on, saying: ((And proficiency in it [i.e., in the science of understanding the appropriateness of the Holy Qur'an] depends on knowing the objective of the Surah in which that is sought. And that benefits knowing the objective of all its sentences)) (1). As you see, he makes knowledge of the Surah's objective the basis of proficiency in understanding the proportion of the Holy Qur'an regarding knowing the reasons for the arrangement of parts of the Qur'anic statement starting from the word in the sentence ending with the Surah. At the same time, this returns with great benefit on knowing the objective of the Surah's sentences by understanding their Compositional Order. This places the interpreter of the Holy Qur'anic statement in a position of reciprocating movement between contemplating and tasting the part, and contemplating and tasting the whole. The more you increase looking into the Qur'anic statement in a part of it, the more it increases your ability to know the Greatest Objective; and the more you increase looking into the Greatest Objective, the more it increases you in understanding the statement of the Compositional Order of the sentence.",

Thus, the Surah becomes like a verdant, tall tree and a magnificent, elegant garden adorned with types of ornaments arranged after elegant leaves with branches of pearls. Its branches bend back to those sections like circles; every circle of them has a branch connected to what is before it, and a branch fused with what is after it. The end of the Surah has connected with its beginning just as its termination adhered to what is after it, and its commencement embraced what is before it. So every Surah became like a great circle containing circles of radiant verses, wondrous in order, amazing in joining, with the softness of the sympathy of its branches and the beauty of the continuity of its fruits and boughs\" (1). He proceeds in this from the Universal Rule which his Sheikh \"Abu al-Fadl al-Mashdali al-Maghribi\" guided him to, and which he stated in the opening of his interpretation of Surah \"Al-Fatihah\" saying: \"The Universal Matter useful for knowing the appropriateness of verses in the entire Qur'an is that you look at the ranks of those premises in proximity and distance from the Desired [Meaning], and look, when speech is dragged into the premises, at what it entails of the listener's soul anticipating (Istishraf) the rulings and implications following it, for which rhetoric requires healing the sick by removing the pain of anticipation through informing about them. This is the Universal Matter dominating the rule of linking between all parts of the Qur'an. If you do this, the face of the Order will become clear to you in detail between every verse and verse in every Surah and Surah, God willing, and Allah is the Guide\" (2).",

And the most rightful to be called after relatives, and the most worthy of priority, were the People of Knowledge who were upon truth but deviated from it, especially if they had kinship; because they are worthy of rushing to answer with the slightest explanation and easiest reminder. If they return, the ignorant will follow them, so his matter becomes easy and his evil is cut off. If they do not return, their argument is prolonged, so their misguidance becomes clear to the ignorant, who then becomes worthy of returning and refraining from his error and abstaining. From the prolongation of speech with them, rulings became known and Halal and Haram became clear. Therefore, when He finished the call to the Arabs which included others briefly, and concluded by promising for following guidance and threatening [for opposing], He Almighty began specifically mentioning the scholars among the Hypocrites, who were those who showed Islam from the People of the Book in a way entailing the generality of those among them explicitly declaring disbelief, since they were among the greatest of those singled out to receive what He pointed to of guidance and statement containing healing. Their Book containing guidance was among the greatest, most famous, and most comprehensive of Books. So He narrated to them what softens iron and humbles rocks, saying Almighty reminding them of His specific favors upon them (O Children of Israel)\" (1).

    "text": "\"And it is permissible to establish the appropriateness from the beginning of the Surah in another way, so it is said: Since the disbelievers were of two types: a type whose disbelief was pure (Mahd), and a type who mixed it with hypocrisy and deception. And the Pure was of two types: a type having no knowledge from a previous scripture, who are the polytheists of the Arabs, and a type having a scripture from which they know the truth. He Almighty mentioned the Pure type with what encompasses its two parts: the Knowledgeable and the Ignorant, saying Almighty: {Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe} (Al-Baqarah: 6). Then He followed it with the type of Hypocrites; because they are more important due to their intense mixing with the believers and showing that they are of them, so that they [believers] may be wary of their deception. So He Almighty said: {And of the people are some who say, 'We believe in Allah and the Last Day,' but they are not believers} (Al-Baqarah: 8). When He finished that, and what it entailed of commanding Oneness, establishing its proofs and pouring out its virtues, and expressing wonder at one who disbelieves despite the establishment of proofs, warning of those calamities, and soliciting affection by mentioning blessings, He began mentioning a type of the Pure who is like the Hypocrite in that he knows the truth and hides it. For the Hypocrite accustomed himself to disbelief, then desisted from it [outwardly], and showed putting on Islam while continuing on disbelief inwardly. This type [Jews] was upon belief in this Prophet, peace be upon him, before his call. When he called them, they erased the faith they were wearing and showed disbelief, and their state continued on showing disbelief and hiding the Knowledge which is the beginning of Faith. So their state, as you see, is most similar to the state of Hypocrites; that is why you see them paired with them in much of the Qur'an. He delayed them due to the length of their story and what it contains of proofs of Prophethood and signs of Message by revealing what they hid of the details of their knowledge. For debating the Scholar sends the horses of thoughts into the fields of knowledge, so they speed into the regions of desires until they become like birds and bring wondrous secrets.",

In its details, as you will see of wondrous description, are matters too majestic for description, tasted by good instruction, and curing the stuttering of the one ignorant of it by subtle speech. Allah is the Guardian of success and the Guide to the straightest path\" (1). You see in the second face a detail not present in the first, facilitating for you the vision of the movement of the Qur'anic meaning in the verses of that passage of the Surah's passages. In his reference to the multiplicity of faces of proportion and generation is guidance to the firmness of the attachment between parts of the Qur'anic Surah. This is the nature of the High Statement; it does not grant you a single face of meanings or giving, but rather treasures for you in its statement types of meanings of guidance, and leaves you to strive in extracting what aligns with your capacity as an incitement to continue striving in deduction. At the same time, it wards off the calamity of boredom if you were to take in every attempt of Ijtihad what you took in the previous one. But if you encounter in every time from the overflow of giving other than what you encountered in the one before it, you approach with the approach of the aspiring, yearning hopeful. In it is [the fact] that degrees of giving multiply and vary with the multiplicity of those striving in contemplation and vary with the variation of their capacities. Al-Biqa'i, after presenting to you what stood in his chest regarding the two faces of proportion and generation in the verses of this passage paving the way for the verses of the following passage, proceeds to establish before you what stood in the chest of \"Abu al-Hasan al-Haralli\" regarding that, saying: \"And 'Al-Haralli' said: 'Then the address turned to the Children of Israel, organized by the beginning of the address to the Arabs from His saying (O Mankind). Likewise, the organization of the Qur'an organizes the head of an address with the head of another address suitable to it in the totality of its meaning, and organizes its detail with its detail. So the first and most worthy to be addressed after the Arabs - who are a Seal - were the Children of Israel - who are a Beginning, being the first upon whom was revealed the First Book",

Then he said: When the turning of the address to the Arabs, who had no prior guidance, was organized by what preceded it of address to the Prophet, peace be upon him, the address to the Children of Israel was organized by the address to the Arabs, due to what preceded for them of guidance in their time {Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. The prophets who submitted [to Allah] judged by it for the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the Scripture of Allah, and they were witnesses thereto. So do not fear the people but fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for a small price. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers} (Al-Ma'idah: 44). And due to what was covenanted to them of doubling the guidance by what preceded for them in their ascension from the perfection of guidance through Muhammad, peace be upon him, and through this Qur'an. Therefore, the priority was their rushing to it so the Arabs would be guided by them, to be the first believer due to what they have of His previous knowledge.' End quote\" (1). What \"Al-Haralli\" explained contains what guides to the rhetorical Sunnah of the Holy Qur'an in coordinating meanings and presenting some over others due to the succession of the second upon the first and its generation from it. It is not hidden from you that what Al-Biqa'i explained, especially the second face, has a bond of lineage to the saying of \"Al-Haralli\". \"Al-Biqa'i\" still summarizes for you the movement of meaning in its context during the Surahs. You see him, when interpreting the saying of Allah Almighty {These are the verses of Allah which We recite to you in truth. And indeed, you are of the messengers} (Al-Baqarah: 252), saying: \"Perhaps the conclusion of the stories of the Children of Israel with this story is because it contains for the Prophet, peace be upon him, clear indication of the validity of his claim to Messengerhood; because it is of what none knows except the few of the skilled scholars of the Children of Israel.",

So that was in the utmost appropriateness to what is in the beginnings of the Surah in the saying of Allah Almighty: {O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous} (Al-Baqarah: 21) to the end of those verses of proofs of Tawhid containing proofs of Prophethood with which the stories of the Children of Israel opened. Thus, proofs of Tawhid bracketed their story, its beginning and its end, along with what is in its midst, proceeding on the Wise Style in struggling against scholars and debating the virtuous. So the summary of that is as if it was said (Alif, Lam, Mim) alerting the souls with what the All-Knowing, Glory be to Him and Exalted, kept exclusive to His knowledge. When hearing was cast and understandings were present, it was said: 'O Mankind'. When anticipation became great, He said: 'Worship your Lord'.

When you look at his stance on the escalation of the Qur'anic meaning in Surah Al-Baqarah and the generation of those meanings when he interprets the verse which he holds to be the conclusion of Surah Al-Baqarah despite being followed by thirty other verses: \"Ayat al-Kursi\" (2), you hear him saying: ... \"When He Almighty began 'Al-Fatihah' as passed by mentioning the Essence (Dhat), then made Himself known by Actions; because they are witnessed, then elevated the address to making known by Attributes, then elevated it returning to the Essence for qualification for Gnosis (Ma'rifah), He began this Surah [Surah Al-Baqarah] with the Attribute of Speech [meaning His saying: That is the Book...]; because it is the greatest of miracles, the clearest of them, the most indicative of the Unseen of the Essence, and the most effective in souls especially among Arabs. Then He made Himself known by Actions, and multiplied them. When no ambiguity remained, He established Oneness with His preceding verses, interspersing that with arts of wisdom and beauties of rulings and types of encouragement and intimidation in precise description and arrangement. When the commands were complete, and those deterrents struck terror, and souls looked forward to that Day—since the familiar from kings of the world is that they are hardly capable of a matter of matters with true capability due to the multitude of intercessors and willing friends, for the king among them his council is never free of a group each of whom is fit to stand in his place, and if he abandoned him or directed his plot against him, he would weaken his command and enfeeble his arm; so he needs to observe them, please them, and humor them—He Almighty clarified the attribute of the Commander with what He is upon of Majesty, Greatness, effectiveness of command, loftiness above prevention, and transcendence above ungratefulness (Kufr) and peer (Nidd) and uniqueness in all perfections and the preventing awe after its revelation there with the most complete revelation; lest intentions turn to other than Him, or one speaks without His permission, or it be other than what He wants; for that to be more conducive to accepting His command and stopping at His prohibition",

He Almighty has established the matter of Resurrection in this Surah after 'Al-Fatihah' pointed to it with the Day of Judgment in the best establishment.

In every confirmation is a founding of what the Qur'anic statement stands upon of the methodology of distributing meanings. These two matters: escalation of meanings and their generation on one hand, and distribution of the statement about them on the other, are among the majestic characteristics of the Rhetorical Sunnah in the Holy Qur'an which you do not find in other than it in a manner even strictly distinct from it.

That is the path of the people of righteousness, guidance, and correctness. And Allah Almighty is the Grantor of success to the right way)) (1). With this comprehensive summary of what are main pillars upon which Surah Al-Baqarah stands and rises, realizing for it its miraculousness in arranging the meanings of guidance within it in a manner making it the Hump of the Holy Qur'an, its Tent, and its Peak. Al-Biqa'i was aware of the good division and its wonder for the universal meanings from which Surah Al-Baqarah was established, and aware of the methodology of the Holy Qur'an in dividing the high rulings and etiquettes contained in the Hump of the Holy Qur'an and the methodology of the Surah in opening every section and concluding it. *** We look into another Surah from the \"Hundreds\" (Mi'un) after looking at a Surah from the \"Long Ones\" (Tiwl). We look at his explanation of the objective of Surah \"An-Nahl\". He says: \"Its objective is indicating that He Almighty is Perfect in Power and Knowledge, Doer by Choice, Transcendent above impurities of deficiency\" (2). Then he adds an explicit statement on proving Tawhid (Oneness) which he expressed generally by his saying (Transcendent above impurities of deficiency), for the first and greatest of impurities of deficiency is Shirk (Polytheism). Whoever has a partner is not transcendent above the head of impurities of deficiency. Perhaps Al-Biqa'i did not explicitly state Tawhid first in verifying the objective of the Surah—and he frequently reviews his interpretation—as an indication from him that Tawhid is the antecedent (Malzum) of what he explicitly stated of the perfection of His Knowledge, Power, Choice, and Transcendence above impurities of deficiency. Explicitly stating the consequents (Lawazim) necessitates knowledge of the antecedent. Whoever accepts the consequent must accept the antecedent inevitably: Whoever accepts for you that so-and-so moves must accept that he is alive, for life is the antecedent of movement. This is a methodology of the methodologies of binding to the truth.",

    "text": "As if Al-Biqa'i points by that to the methodology of the Surah in providing evidence. It takes the mention of blessings as gratitude-inducing evidence for the Oneness of the Benefactor and the perfection of His Knowledge, Power, Choice, and Transcendence above impurities of deficiency. This is what the Surah is based on. So Al-Biqa'i made us feel by this action of his the reality of the methodology on which the statement in the Surah is based: stating explicitly the consequent to achieve and confirm the antecedent. However, the statement of the Surah establishes sentences explicitly stating Tawhid in specific locations of the area of statement within it: You find in the beginning of the first passage Him saying, Mighty and Majestic: {That you warn that there is no deity except Me, so fear Me} (An-Nahl: from Verse 2). And He says at the conclusion of enumerating a group of His blessings bestowed and used as evidence for His Oneness, Knowledge, Power, and Transcendence above impurities of deficiency (Verses: 2-21): {Your god is one God} (An-Nahl: from Verse 22). After mentioning what the disbelievers objected to the Call with and demolishing it (Verses: 24-50), He explicitly states Tawhid {And Allah has said, \"Do not take for yourselves two deities. He is but one God, so fear only Me.\"} (An-Nahl: 51). When you follow the look into the verses of the Surah, you find they are descended from the meaning of proving the Oneness of Allah Almighty and the Beautiful Attributes necessitated by it: Perfection of Knowledge, Power, and Choice, by means of blessings, even if the indication of verses to this meaning varies. Thus, the Surah is based on the methodology of distributing the statement about the single meaning (The Greatest Objective) in different ways regarding clarity of indication to it. This is not specific to Surah \"An-Nahl\" but inclusive of every Surah of the Holy Qur'an.",

Whoever wishes to study a Surah in the light of the methodology of the Science of Bayan, he must not limit his diligence in contemplation and interpretation to these styles in the Surah. Rather, it includes contemplating and pondering the indication of every sentence and verse to the Greatest Objective of the Surah (The Single Meaning) designated in it, and the degrees of difference in indication, and the relationship of this variation in ways of expression to the partial meaning and the universal meaning, relying on contemplating and pondering the Compositional and Ordinal Order of sentences, verses, and passages. *** If Al-Biqa'i is concerned with achieving the objective of the Surah whose methodology of statement he is contemplating, he is also keen on reviewing what he concludes of deducing the Greatest Objective of the Surah whose statement he is interpreting and whose great system proportion he is explaining. He shows us sometimes that he has re-examined the verification and liberation of the Surah's objective and something higher appeared to him than what he had indicated before. He says in the opening of Surah \"Al-A'raf\": \"Its objective is warning those who turned away from what the Book called to in the past Surah of Tawhid, gathering on good, and fulfilling what evidence established as obligatory in Al-An'am, and cautioning him with the calamities of the two abodes. This is better than what appeared to me [before], and I mentioned it at: {And the weighing on that Day is the truth. So those whose scales are heavy - it is they who are the successful} (Al-A'raf: 8) (1).

    "text": "So it became liberated that the objective of the Surah is urging to follow the Book, which implies urging to follow the Messenger, proving Tawhid and the Power of Resurrection by explaining the terrifying actions in the beginning of creation and destruction of the ancients, signaling that whoever does not follow him and declare the Oneness of the One who sent him down in this style that cannot be imitated and the methodology before which minds and natures stood still—due to the establishment of proofs of His Oneness that others are incapable of His sayings and actions—he is on the verge of being hastened before the Day of Resurrection with a punishment like the punishment of past nations and empty generations, along with what is stored for him on that Day of evil outcome and to show the effect of Anger\" (1). You see him at the beginning of the Surah dedicating the objective to the meaning of Warning. This meaning is the axis around which the universal meanings of the Surah revolve, composed of partial meanings portrayed by the Surah's sentences and verses. In his interpretation of the eighth verse {And the weighing on that Day is the truth. So those whose scales are heavy - it is they who are the successful} (Al-A'raf: 8), he makes the objective more general than the meaning of Warning, even though Warning exists in that general objective, for in pointing to the Power of Resurrection is the meaning of Warning, because there is no meaning for Resurrection if it does not result in recompensing servants for what they did, whether good or evil. The summary of the matter is that Al-Biqa'i is keen on striving to verify the Universal Meaning dominating the Surah whose statement he is interpreting and whose system proportion he is explaining. He is keen that this meaning has existence in the passages of the Surah, even if its trace is subtle sometimes in understanding the partial meanings forming the meanings of the passages from which the Surah's system is composed. This methodology is among the most important things distinguishing Al-Biqa'i's Tafsir from other Tafsirs preceding it, or even succeeding it, for you hardly find a Tafsir like his in that keenness and tracking in every Surah of all the Holy Qur'an's Surahs.",

    "text": "There is no doubt that turning to highlight some faces of proportion of some verses in their succession is not something innovated by \"Al-Biqa'i\"; it is something you find in quite a few books of Tafsir before him. However, you find this in them like nuggets/fragments. You do not find someone whose care turns to verifying the Universal Meaning for every Surah of the Holy Qur'an, and turns to the care of explaining the cohesion, rather the generation, of Universal Meanings existing in the Surah's passages, and the generation of Partial Meanings existing in the Surah's sentences and verses. But you find Al-Biqa'i doing that in every Surah of the Holy Qur'an. The Second Feature. Relationship of the Surah's Name to its Objective. Every Surah of the Holy Qur'an has a name or more by which it is known since it was revealed and until the Hour starts. Al-Biqa'i pays attention to interpreting the naming of Surahs. It is predominant for him to mention the name of the Surah or its names after explaining its Greatest Objective to clarify the face of its name's indication to its objective. That is one of his principles which he declared in the beginning of his interpretation of Surah Al-Fatihah after mentioning the Universal Rule he learned from his Sheikh \"Al-Mashdali\", saying: \"It appeared to me by using this rule after reaching Surah 'Saba' in the tenth year of my starting to work on this book: That the name of every Surah translates its objective; because the name of everything, the appropriateness between it and its named appears [as] its title indicating generally the details of what is in it. That is what 'Adam', peace be upon him, informed of during the Presentation to the Angels - upon them be blessings and peace\" (1). This is based on [the view] that the names of Surahs are traceable (Marfu') [to the Prophet] or Stopped (Mawquf) based on Ijtihad from the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them. Al-Biqa'i did not explicitly state his school in that, although his methodology of interpreting the naming indicates that he is closer to Marfu' (Traceable) than to Mawquf (Stopped).",

    "text": "The important thing is that in Naming there is a temptation that there might be a bond of lineage between the meaning of the Name and the objective of the Surahs named by it. So it is worthy for us to look into it, especially since the naming of quite a few Surahs is not fit to be justified by saying they were named so because of its mention in them. Otherwise, what is the reason for naming the Surah following At-Tawbah as \"Yunus\" peace be upon him, while his story is mentioned in others more extensively than it is mentioned in it? And why was not a single Surah named after \"Moses\" peace be upon him, while he is the most mentioned of Prophets regarding his story with the Children of Israel? And why was Surah \"Bani Isra'il: Al-Isra\" not named \"Musa\"? Nay, why was Surah Al-Qasas not named \"Musa\" peace be upon him, while his story was elaborated in it and news of him was mentioned in it that was not mentioned in others, and no story of other Prophets was mentioned in it other than his story, and what came of the story of Qarun, for Qarun was from the people of Moses peace be upon him. This indicates clearly that the matter of Naming does not revert to the mere mention of the name in that Surah. The important thing is that Al-Biqa'i takes care to mention the name of the Surah or its names if multiple, and in their multiplicity is an indication of its great merit and the breadth of its objective. He mentions to us the names of Surah Al-Fatihah: \"So Al-Fatihah, its name is 'Mother of the Book', 'The Foundation', 'The Mathani', 'The Treasure', 'The Healer', 'The Sufficient', 'The Fulfilling', 'The Ruqyah', 'The Praise', 'The Gratitude', 'The Dua', and 'The Prayer'. He explains the relationship of the objective of Al-Fatihah: 'Observation of servants of their Lord; to single Him out in worship', saying: 'The pivot of these names as you see is upon a hidden matter sufficient for every desire, which is Observation (Muraqabah) which I will say is its objective. For everything not opened by it has no consideration. It is a treasure for everything, healing for every worry, fulfilling every desire, protecting from every evil, a Ruqyah for every affliction. It is the establishment of Praise which is encompassing attributes of perfection, and Gratitude which is magnifying the Benefactor. It is the essence of Dua, for it is turning to the Called, and the greatest of its gatherings is Prayer'\" (1).",

Contemplating the meaning of the Name guides to seeing a feature of the features of the Surah's objective. If you gather those features, coordinate them, and visualize a universal meaning they revolve around, you are close to realizing the Greatest Objective of the Surah. He says in Surah \"Yunus\" peace be upon him, clarifying the reason for specializing this Surah with this name, and specializing the story of \"Yunus\" peace be upon him to be the title of the Surah although other stories were mentioned in it: \"Noah\" peace be upon him (Verses 71-74) and \"Moses\" peace be upon him (Verses 75-93), then one verse was mentioned regarding the story of the people of \"Yunus\" peace be upon him: {Then has there not been a [single] city that believed so its faith benefited it except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life and gave them enjoyment for a time} (Yunus: 98). He says: \"Its objective: Describing the Book as being from Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted, due to what it contains of Wisdom, and that it is only from Him Glory be to Him and Exalted because other than Him is incapable of anything of it. That indicates without doubt that He is One in His dominion, having no partner in anything of His affair. The completion of the proof for this is the story of the people of 'Yunus' peace be upon him, that when they believed at the signs of doom, He removed [punishment] from them. This proved decisively that the One bringing it is Allah in whom they believed. For if it were another, their belief in Him would have necessitated bringing [punishment] upon them. And if they were punished like others, it would have been said: This is the habit of time, just as they said 'Hardship and ease touched our fathers'. This indicated that the punishment of others among nations is only from Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted for their disbelief, due to the consistency of that directly with the conditions of all nations, that whenever persistence in denial is found, punishment is found, and inversely, whenever it is negated in a time accepting the acceptance of repentance, it is negated.

It was from the overflow of the Self-Subsistence of the Truth (Al-Haqq) and that He is Doer of what He wills, and that He is the One who punishes whom He wills with what He wills and when He wills and for what He wills, for that is for a wisdom of which He is knowledgeable. He is the One who revealed this Wise Book which guides to that and narrates to us from those news what others did not narrate. So the One who brought Mercy from the punishment to the people of Yunus is the One who brought the Wise Book to His servant and Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace.

What was inspired to the Bee contains knowledge that achieves its security and happiness in its life, which is known and famous among humans, believer and disbeliever alike. If this is undoubted, then Inspiration to the Best of Creation must be greater in achieving the security of servants and their happiness in the Two Abodes. And no one does that except One God, Knowledgeable, Powerful, Choosing, Transcendent above impurities of deficiency. Contemplating the state of the Bee indicates clearly that the One who created it and inspired it is indeed the One, All-Knowing, All-Powerful, Chooser. So this verse and that blessing were among the strongest proofs for establishing the objective of the Surah, for you do not find anyone disputing the characteristics the Bee was specialized with, dazzling characteristics whose most apparent features are knowledge, order, and ability to achieve the desired. As for naming the Surah \"An-Ni'am\" (The Blessings), Al-Biqa'i suffices in its interpretation and justification by saying: \"And its naming as The Blessings is clear in that.\" This clarity is like the clarity of naming it \"An-Nahl\" except that the direction of clarity is different: Clarity of indication in naming it An-Nahl is from what was known and famous among commoners and elite regarding the affair of the Bee which I pointed to before. And clarity of naming it \"An-Ni'am\" is from the abundance of mentioning blessings and favors in this Surah. It was from the Sunnah of the statement about these blessings to order it in a way indicating the exclusivity of the Truth, Mighty and Majestic, in doing that, like His saying Almighty: {It is He who sends down rain from the sky; from it is drink and from it is foliage in which you pasture [animals]} (An-Nahl: 10). Such a structure: defining both parties \"He - Who\" is useful for Exclusivity. As if it was said: No one sent down water from the sky except Him. This is a meaning of the meanings of \"La ilaha illa Allah\" (There is no deity but Allah) which is the title of Tawhid and Absolute Perfection.",

And that this Universal Meaning is the distinguisher between Surahs. And that in the name of every Surah is an indication to its objective, an indication generated from the fact that that Name is linked firmly to that Universal Meaning dominating that Surah. Hence, the criterion for naming or its motive is not that the name was mentioned in that Surah as previously pointed out. The matter stems from and returns to the Universal Meaning dominating that Surah and what is hidden in that Name of indication to that dominating Universal Meaning. If literary critics in Al-Biqa'i's era and after him had invested this and searched for the Universal Meaning dominating the poem and chose for it a name indicating that dominating meaning, they would have opened for Literary Criticism a wide road and a wondrous path. --- The Third Feature. Interpreting the Basmalah according to the Surah's Objective. Among what the methodology of interpreting the Holy Qur'an according to Al-Biqa'i is based upon is that every word of the Holy Qur'an, if mentioned again with its letters in another context, what is repeated is only what the tongue pronounces. As for what the heart perceives of that uttered word repeated in another context, it is another matter whose perception has not occurred in the manner it is now. This is not specific to the word but [applies] to the sentence and verse. Therefore, he looks at the Basmalah as carrying in the opening of every Surah in which it came a meaning other than what it carried in the previous Surah. This means that the context in which the Basmalah stands has a great effect in words and structures carrying meanings that do not wear out with frequent repetition.",

    "text": "He says: \"And I interpret every Basmalah with what agrees with the objective of the Surah, and I do not depart from the meanings of its words\" (1). In his interpretation of the Basmalah of every Surah, he turns to the three Beautiful Names: Allah, Al-Rahman, Al-Rahim, mentioning with every name what fits the content of the Surah of this Basmalah, provided he commits to pointing to the meaning of Gathering and Encompassment with the Name of Majesty (Allah), to the meaning of Generality and Breadth with His name \"Al-Rahman\", and to the meaning of Specification with His name \"Al-Rahim\". He says in the Basmalah of \"Al-Imran\": \"(In the name of Allah) The One, Unique in Encompassing Perfection, (Al-Rahman) whose mercy of creating encompassed every creature and clarified for the legally responsible the path of salvation, (Al-Rahim) who chose the People of Tawhid for the place of His intimacy and the homeland of His gathering and holiness\" (2). You notice here he pointed to the meaning of Oneness and Uniqueness in Encompassing Perfection in his interpretation of the Name of Majesty; because the objective of Surah \"Al-Imran\" is proving Oneness for Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted, and informing that worldly leadership is of no avail. He pointed in interpreting \"Al-Rahman\" to the meaning of the breadth of the mercy of creating for every creature, pointing to His Uniqueness, Majestic is His Glory. And he pointed in interpreting \"Al-Rahim\" to the meaning of choosing the People of Tawhid for closeness. In his interpretation of the Basmalah of Surah \"An-Nisa\", he says: \"(In the name of Allah) The Gatherer of dispersed matters by perfecting the pairing in the subtleties of destiny, (Al-Rahman) who made wombs a general mercy, (Al-Rahim) who singled out whom He wanted for connection based on what His religion called to, which He made a complete blessing\" (3). That is because the objective of Surah \"An-Nisa\": \"Gathering on the Tawhid to which 'Al-Imran' guided and the Book to which Al-Baqarah urged for the sake of the Religion which Al-Fatihah gathered...\" (4). The relationship between the Surah's objective and what \"Al-Biqa'i\" interpreted the Beautiful Names in its Basmalah with is not hidden. - - -",

    "text": "Let us look at his interpretation of the Basmalah of Surah \"An-Nahl\". I have previously explained that its Greatest Objective is: Providing evidence by blessings for the Oneness of Allah Almighty and the perfection of His Knowledge, Power, Choice. We see him say: \"(In the name of Allah) Encompassing the Circle of Perfection, so whatever He wills He does, (Al-Rahman) whose blessing encompassed His great creation and His small creation, His little and His big, (Al-Rahim) who singled out whom He wills with the blessing of salvation from what angers Him to what pleases Him\" (1). His saying (Encompassing the Circle of Perfection) instead of saying: (Encompassing Perfection) is an indication of the breadth of His encompassment of all types of perfection such that a circle surrounds them in which all types of perfection head towards the center of the circle, which is the Divine Essence. So you cannot define the first of the types of perfection nor their last, for everything contained in His verbal and active manifestation revolves in the circle of Divine Perfection. There is no doubt that this will not be unless the Center of Perfection is One. If He is One, He is Perfect in Knowledge and Power and Perfect in Choice, doing what He wills, transcendent above all impurities of deficiency. He explains the name (Al-Rahman) by his saying: (Whose blessing encompassed His great creation and His small creation, His little and His big) indicating that He is the One who bestowed upon Man and guided him to what stabilizes his livelihood and showed him the means of acquiring the necessities of his life and perfections, and He is the One who bestowed upon the most despicable creatures in size among beasts and insects that as well. Likewise, He is the Rahman who bestowed Revelation upon the most perfect of creation, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, containing the happiness of the Two Abodes, and He is the One who inspired the insect, the Bee, and inspired it with what contains its happiness and the happiness of others. No one can generalize that except One who is One, Perfect in Knowledge and Power, doing what He wills. And this is the objective of the Surah.",

    "text": "You see him mentioning his saying (His great creation) first, and concluding with his saying (and His big [creation]). In this is a look from him at Circular Wrapping (Al-Laff Al-Da'iri). This is something Al-Biqa'i cared to look into, almost basing his view of Qur'anic Proportion on the basis of the theory of Circular Order of the statement, whether in the construction of the verse, passage, Surah, or the entire Holy Qur'an. He interprets the name (Al-Rahim) by his saying: \"Who singled out whom He wills with the blessing of salvation from what angers Him to what pleases Him\" indicating that He is the One who singled out the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace, by revealing the Holy Qur'an to him (Verse 44) and by giving glad tidings of the Night Journey (Isra) (Verse 127), and singled out the Friend, the Father of Prophets Abraham peace be upon him, by making him a model for the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family and companions and grant them abundant peace (Verse 123), and singled out the Muslims with the Holy Qur'an as a methodology of life so He saved them from His wrath by the religion He was pleased with for them (Verse 89), and singled them out by permitting for them much of what He forbade for others (Verse 114), and singled them out by accepting Friday which others from the People of the Book before them rejected, so it was a blessing on the Muhammadan Ummah (Verse 124), and singled out the Bee with precision of understanding in engineering hives and caring for its affairs with a system from which humans derive much of their methodology (Verses 68-69). This can never be except from One, Perfect in Knowledge and Power, doing what He wills. Thus Al-Biqa'i's methodology in interpreting the meanings of the Basmalah in Surah An-Nahl becomes clear to you according to its Greatest Objective, which is the Universal Meaning that all its verses came to clarify in different ways regarding the clarity of their indication to it. *** When you look at this action of his, it becomes clear to you that what he interprets the Basmalah with is not deduced from the objective of the Surah, but rather he mentions meanings that align with that objective. His methodology in this specific topic is not a deductive methodology but a conciliatory one, mentioning what agrees with what became clear to him of that objective, all while adhering to the universal principles of the meanings of the three Names: \"Allah\", \"Al-Rahman\", and \"Al-Rahim\".",

    "text": "Interpreting the Basmalah in every Surah differently from how it was interpreted in another Surah was not an innovation of \"Al-Biqa'i\". You encounter it in the Tafsir of \"Imam Al-Qushayri: Abd al-Karim bin Hawazin bin Abd al-Malik\" (d. 465) titled: \"Lata'if al-Isharat\", even if the interpretive methodology and its basis differ for each. \"Al-Qushayri\" says regarding the Basmalah of Surah \"Al-Imran\": \"The People of Verification differed regarding the name 'Allah': Is it derived from a meaning or not? Many of them said it is not derived from a meaning, and it is for Him, Glory be to Him, by way of Exclusivity, functioning in its placement like proper nouns for the description of others. So if this word strikes the ears of the People of Gnosis, their understandings and knowledge do not go to a meaning other than His Existence, Glory be to Him and Exalted, and His Right. The right of this statement is to be accompanied by the witnessing of the heart. If he says with his tongue 'Allah' or hears with his ears, he witnesses with his heart 'Allah'. Just as this word does not indicate a meaning other than 'Allah', the witnessed of its speaker is none but 'Allah'. So he says with his tongue 'Allah', knows with his heart (Fu'ad) 'Allah', recognizes with his heart (Qalb) 'Allah', and loves with his spirit 'Allah'... So there is no share in him for other than 'Allah'. If he is on the verge of being annihilated (Mahw) in 'Allah' for 'Allah' by 'Allah', the Truth, Glory be to Him, overtakes him with His mercy, so He unveils to him His saying 'Al-Rahman Al-Rahim' to preserve their souls from perishing, and desiring for their hearts to be purified. Kindness is a Sunnah from Him, Glory be to Him and Exalted, lest His allies (Awliya) perish completely\" (1). It is not hidden that \"Al-Qushayri\" focuses here on meanings of Unifying Allah, Majestic is His Glory, in remembrance, knowledge, worship, witnessing... etc., as if he observes the meaning of Tawhid in Surah \"Al-Imran\". As you see, he points out that mentioning His name \"Al-Rahman Al-Rahim\" comes as a mercy to the Allies from annihilation in the seas of the abstraction of Tawhid. This contradicts Al-Biqa'i's methodology in interpreting the Basmalah. \"Al-Qushayri\" says in interpreting the Basmalah of Surah \"An-Nisa\":",

    "text": "\"They differed regarding the Name: from what was it derived? Some of them said it was derived from 'Sumuw', which is Elevation. Others said it is derived from 'Simah', which is the Brand/Mark. Both are in the allusion (Ishara): Whoever said it is derived from 'Sumuw', it is a name of One whom whoever remembers Him, his rank elevates; whoever knows Him, his state elevates; whoever accompanies Him, his ambition elevates. Elevation of rank necessitates abundance of rewards and kindnesses; elevation of state necessitates appearance of lights in the secrets; elevation of ambition necessitates guarding against the slavery of others. Whoever said its origin is from 'Simah', it is a name of One whom whoever seeks Him is marked with the mark of Worship; whoever accompanies Him is marked with the mark of Will (Murid); whoever loves Him is marked with the mark of the Elite; whoever knows Him is marked with the mark of Specialization. The mark of Worship necessitates the awe of Fire to throw its sparks at its owner. The mark of Will necessitates the modesty of Gardens to covet enslaving its owner despite its noble worth. The mark of the Elite necessitates the fall of self-admiration regarding entitlement to closeness for water and clay in general. The mark of Specialization necessitates the erasure of judgment upon the seizure of the authority of Reality. It is said: A name of One whom whoever connects with, His destiny, Glory be to Him, elevates in his view above illusions; and whoever disconnects from Him, his heart is marked with the brand of separation\" (1). \"Al-Qushayri\", as you see, made the basis of interpretation in the Basmalah of \"An-Nisa\" the derivation of the word \"Al-Ism\" and the allusive indication of this derivation. It is as if I see him observing in this the meaning of the derivation of offspring from wombs and observing the meaning of the saying of Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted: {O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed Allah is ever, over you, an Observer} (An-Nisa: 1). The generation of meanings from the root of derivation establishes between them a semantic womb (kinship) like the womb existing between the offspring of our father Adam, peace be upon him.",

    "text": "And when you look into his interpretation of the Basmalah of Surah \"Al-Hijr\", you hear him saying: \"The Alif of connection (Wasl) fell from the writing of 'Bismillah', and there is no cause for its falling. And an increase was made in the length of the 'Ba' of 'Bismillah' and there is no cause for its increase; to make known that affirmation and dropping are without cause. He who was accepted was not accepted for deserving a cause, nor was he who was rejected rejected for necessitating a cause. If it is said: The cause for dropping the Alif from 'Bismillah' is frequent usage in its writing, it is problematic that the 'Ba' of 'Bismillah' was increased in its writing while frequent usage exists. If it is said: In increasing the length of the 'Ba' is the blessing of its favors, it is problematic due to the deletion of the Alif of connection; because connection is present through it. Thus, nothing remains except that Affirmation and Negation have no cause; He raises whom He wills and prevents whom He wills\" (1). He made the basis of interpretation here the orthographic aspect of the Basmalah: dropping a letter and increasing the shape of another adjacent letter, noting the absence of a rational Arabic cause such that the effect is realized where the cause is realized. He explained that the matter belongs to absolute Divine Will, and that there are no causes by whose existence effects exist, but there are means where effects exist *at* them, not *by* them. There is a difference between a thing being *by* a thing and being *at* (in the presence of) a thing. As if in his choice to point to this meaning in interpreting the Basmalah of Surah Al-Hijr, he is looking at His saying, Mighty and Majestic, in it: {And there is not a thing but that with Us are its depositories, and We do not send it down except according to a known measure} (Al-Hijr: 21). As if this verse is the Mother Verse and the Axis Verse upon which the Holy Qur'anic meaning in Surah Al-Hijr revolves. The important thing is that interpreting the Basmalah of every Surah differently from how it was interpreted in another is a methodology that some people of knowledge brought before \"Al-Biqa'i\", and each has his way in interpretation. What is taken from all this is that those adopting that way in interpretation proceed from a matter of value in the Rhetorical Jurisprudence of speech:",

    "text": "They proceed from the desire to avoid saying there is verbal and semantic repetition of words in different contexts, and that the word and what is above it only comes once and has only one position. If it is established in another station, it is not the one that was before. This means that the semantic existence of the word renews with the renewal of the locations of the word and what is above it, and that the claim of rhetorical repetition in high speech, let alone the miraculous High Speech, is a claim lacking scientific verification. Hence, the world of Rhetoric does not know copying (Tanasukh) between its components and contents. It is a world composed of renewing elements. As if the world of Rhetoric is from the world of Paradise, for example: its fruits resemble each other but do not become identical, rather they renew and multiply: {Every time they are fed with a fruit from it, they say, \"This is what we were fed with before,\" and it is given to them in resemblance. And for them therein are purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally} (Al-Baqarah: from Verse 25). Based on this, it is worthy for one who undertakes to sail in the dictionaries of Rhetorical Interpretation of the Holy Qur'an to be aware that the Qur'anic statement is void of emphatic repetition that does not add something new and praiseworthy to what was previously founded. And to be aware that the Qur'anic statement has two great characteristics: First: The characteristic of generation of Qur'anic meaning and its escalation. And the Other: The characteristic of Rhetorical Distribution (Tasrif). These two characteristics I see as among the most comprehensive characteristics of the Rhetorical Miraculousness of the Holy Qur'an after the characteristic of establishing the feeling of the majesty of the Speaker in the heart of the receiver who is healed from the disease of heedlessness. The Fourth Feature. The Brilliant Opening and its Relationship to the Surah's Objective.

    "text": "If we have seen him interpreting the Basmalah in a way fitting the Surah's objective as an indication that there is a Brilliant Opening in the Basmalah, just as he sees in the Surah's name a brilliant opening of its Universal Meaning and Greatest Objective as previously indicated, then above this is the opening of the first verses of the Surah with its meaning. Thus, in every Surah, there is what points to its Universal Meaning: its Name, its Basmalah, and the first verse or verses of it. It is predominant for Al-Biqa'i not to specify the opening of the Surah and its exordium for us, but he alludes to that during his interpretation. Also, the specification might be understood from the place where he mentions what he quotes in the opening of every Surah from the speech of \"Abu Ja'far bin al-Zubair\" regarding the proportion of Surahs from his book \"Al-Burhan\". The matter becomes clearer at the conclusion of his interpretation of the Surah when he returns the Surah's segment (end) to its opening. In Surah \"Al-Baqarah\", its opening is from its beginning to His saying, Mighty and Majestic: {Those are on guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful} (Al-Baqarah: 5). What follows it of mentioning those who disbelieve and the hypocrites is a completion of the exordium, so that the subject of the Surah begins with His saying Glory be to Him {O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous} (Al-Baqarah: 21). This opening contains an exordium with the Surah's Greatest Objective: \"Establishing the evidence that the Book is guidance to be followed in everything it says, and the greatest thing it guides to is Belief in the Unseen.\" This is what the Opening focused on as is not hidden, for it explicitly made the basis and origin of the attributes of the Pious—for whom the Book was guidance—Belief in the Unseen. It made the head of their attributes in the first verse of describing the Pious: \"and out of what We have provided them, they spend,\" and made the head of their attributes in the second verse of describing the Pious that \"and of the Hereafter they are certain.\"",

    "text": "Spending in the cause of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, seeking reward is but the fruit of Belief in the Unseen. And belief in the Hereafter is but belief in the Unseen of which there is no way to know anything except from the reporting of the Book or the Sunnah. In the Exordium (Istihlal) are main sentences explicitly stating the Objective. If the contemplator is guided to visualize them, the path to understanding the Surah's Greatest Objective becomes paved. Therefore, you see him in Surah Al-Baqarah pointing out that the incitement to spending has appeared clearly in several places of the Surah. You see him pointing out, when interpreting the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic: {They ask you what they should spend. Say, \"Whatever you spend of good is for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler. And whatever you do of good - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.\"} (Al-Baqarah: 215), that there is an indication to Spending in the beginning of the Surah, saying: ... \"Since Spending is among the fundamentals upon which the Surah was built regarding the attributes of the believers [the pious] (and out of what We have provided them, they spend) (Al-Baqarah: 3), then He repeated encouraging it in the folds of verses until He commanded it in the first verses of Hajj passed recently, although it is among the pillars of the beginnings of Jihad, until the previous verse contained it along with fighting which is the end of Jihad. This was the place of asking about them, so He Almighty informed about that by way of 'Irregular Spreading' (Nashr Mushawwash)...\" (1). It is clear that spending seeking reward for the sake of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, is only adopted by one who believes in the Unseen; otherwise, his spending would not be 'seeking reward' (Ihtisab), and thus void in the scale of Law. He confirms the like of what I quoted from him here in interpreting the saying of Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted: {Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? And it is Allah who withholds and grants abundance, and to Him you will be returned} (Al-Baqarah: 245).",

And when interpreting the saying of Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted: {O you who have believed, spend from that which We have provided for you before there comes a Day in which there is no exchange and no friendship and no intercession. And the disbelievers - they are the wrongdoers} (Al-Baqarah: 254), he says: \"Since differing over Prophets was a cause for Jihad which is the Enclosure of Religion, and the pillar of Jihad is Spending, He followed that by His saying—returning to the beginning of the Surah from here to its end, and to emphasizing with the word of Command regarding what He previously encouraged of the matter of Spending—(O you who have believed)\" (2). *** In Surah \"Al-Imran\", we find the Opening of the Surah from its beginning to the end of the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic {And Allah is Exalted in Might, Owner of Retribution} (Al-Imran: from Verse 4). In this Opening is care for portraying and establishing the meaning of Oneness for Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted, and informing that worldly leadership is of no avail in this world or the Hereafter. That is the Greatest Objective of the Surah. As you see, it is apparent to you from the saying of Allah, Majestic is His Glory, in the Opening: {Alif, Lam, Mim * Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence} (Al-Imran: 1-2) and from the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic: {...Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a severe punishment, and Allah is Exalted in Might, Owner of Retribution} (Al-Imran: 4). These two sentences signal the Greatest Objective of the Surah to one who has insight in understanding the statement of the Wise Reminder about its meanings. *** In Surah \"An-Nisa\", you find the Opening of the Surah from its beginning to the end of His saying Glory be to Him and Exalted:",

For in this Opening is what explicitly states the objective of the Surah, such as His saying, Majestic is His Glory: {created you from one soul} and His saying Glory be to Him and Exalted: {through whom you ask one another, and the wombs} and His saying, Majestic is His Glory: {Indeed Allah is ever, over you, an Observer}. These sentences are like explicit declarations of the meaning of Gathering upon a great matter, and the greatest thing to gather upon is the Tawhid of Allah Glory be to Him and Exalted. It is a gathering that achieves the meaning of uterine connection by which human existence stands. This is the Greatest Objective of Surah An-Nisa, to begin the detailing of the statement about this objective by His saying: \"And give the orphans... etc.\" (1). You see the Surah has established rulings and etiquettes that guide to realizing the firm, merciful, cohesive structure of the family and the nation, so it gathers upon what pleases its Lord, Mighty and Majestic. Al-Biqa'i compares the opening of this Surah with the saying of Allah Almighty: {O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed Allah is ever, over you, an Observer} (An-Nisa: 1) with the opening of Surah \"Al-Hajj\" with the saying of Allah Almighty: {O mankind, fear your Lord. Indeed, the convulsion of the [final] Hour is a terrible thing} (Al-Hajj: 1). And how the objective of every Surah is what required that the description of the Lord commanded to be feared in the beginning of every Surah be different from what He was described with in the other. Rather, he looks at the position of every Surah in the extended Qur'anic context. He says in interpreting the opening of Surah \"An-Nisa\": \"He, Glory be to Him, made the command of Taqwa (Fear/Piety) an opening for two Surahs: This one, which is the fourth of the first half, and Hajj, which is the fourth of the second half.

    "text": "And He justified that in Hajj with what portrayed the Return (Al-Ma'ad) in a depiction upon which there is no addition. Thus, He indicated in them the Origin and the Return, alerting that it is the focus of Wisdom; existence was created only for its sake; so that the Beautiful Names and Lofty Attributes appear with the most complete appearance humans can view. He arranged that in the most precise arrangement, so He advanced the Surah of Origin over the Surah of Return; so that the recited verses would be congruent with the seen verses\" (1). *** Al-Biqa'i has good attention to the Brilliant Opening of the five Surahs with \"Al-Hamdu lillah\" (Praise be to Allah). They are the Surahs: Al-Fatihah, Al-An'am, Al-Kahf, Saba, and Fatir. And how the objective of every Surah required that it opens with other than what the other opens with, even if they share starting with 'Al-Hamdu lillah'. In this, he relies on a statement by \"Al-Sa'd Al-Taftazani\" in the introduction of his book \"Al-Talwih 'ala Sharh Al-Tanqih\" in Hanafi principles of jurisprudence by Sadr al-Shari'ah. Al-Biqa'i quoted it from him in his interpretation of Surah Al-Fatihah saying: \"And it was indicated in 'The Mother of the Book' - as the scholar Sa'd al-Din Mas'ud bin Umar Al-Taftazani Al-Shafi'i said - to all blessings. For they return to Creation (Ijad) and Preservation (Ibqa') first, and to Creation and Preservation second in the Abode of Annihilation and the Abode of Survival. As for the First Creation, it is by His saying Glory be to Him and Exalted {Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds} (Al-Fatihah: 2), for bringing out from non-existence to existence is the greatest nurturing. As for the First Preservation, it is by His saying Mighty and Majestic: {The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful} meaning the Bestower of major blessings and their subtleties by which survival is. As for the Second Creation, it is by His saying, Majestic is His Glory {Master of the Day of Judgment}, and it is apparent. As for the Second Preservation, it is by His saying: {It is You we worship} to its end, for the benefits of that return to the Hereafter. Then the exportation with Praise came after Al-Fatihah in four Surahs; in each Surah of them, one of these blessings was indicated according to their arrangement.\" (2).",

    "text": "So Al-Fatihah \"Mother of the Book\" gathers the indication to everything for which Praise is due to Allah. Then the four universal causes of Praise are distributed, each cause in a Surah, and these Surahs are coordinated according to the arrangement of causes. So Surah Al-An'am opens with Praise to Allah for the blessing of the First Creation: {Praise be to Allah, who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light. Then those who disbelieve equate [others] with their Lord. * It is He who created you from clay, then He decreed a term and a specified time [known] to Him; then [still] you are in doubt} (Al-An'am: 1-2). And Surah \"Al-Kahf\" opens with Praise for the blessing of the First Preservation, the highest of which is the blessing of revealing the Book: {Praise be to Allah, who has sent down upon His Servant the Book and has not made therein any deviance. * [He has made it] straight, to warn of severe punishment from Him and to give good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a good reward * In which they will remain forever * And to warn those who say, \"Allah has taken a son.\" * They have no knowledge of it, nor had their fathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie} (Al-Kahf: 1-5). And Surah \"Saba\" opens with Praise to Allah for the blessing of the Second Creation (Resurrection).",

If We should will, We could cause the earth to swallow them or [could] let fall upon them fragments from the sky. Indeed in that is a sign for every servant turning back [to Allah].} (Saba: 1-9).

Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. * Whatever Allah grants to people of mercy - none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds - none can release it thereafter. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.} (Fatir: 1-2). In every Surah, there is scattered evidence pointing to the cause of the Praise with which it begins, according to the arrangement. The context here does not allow for a detailed discussion of this, and I have detailed it in my doctoral dissertation: \"Quranic Proportionality according to Al-Biqa'i\". In the opening of each of the four Surahs starting with \"Al-Hamd\" (Praise be to Allah), there is an indication of the Surah's content and its objective, based on the order of the blessings for which Allah Almighty is praised, which are comprehensive, universal blessings. The attention to interpreting the opening of the Surah and its indication of its greatest objective stems from the belief that the Quranic Surah is based on a total meaning that dominates all components of the Surah, and that the opening of the Surah guides to the hidden meanings within it. This methodology in interpretation is one of the fundamentals of Arab theory in understanding rhetoric. The scholars of Arabic paid attention to this chapter; some critics advised writers: \"Improve, O assembly of writers, the openings, for they are the indicators of the statement\" (1). The Fifth Feature: Returning the End (Maqta') of the Surah to its Opening (Matla'). Al-Biqa'i establishes his methodology in interpreting Quranic rhetoric on the basis that the structure of the Quranic Surah is like the structure of a continuous circle whose ends are joined together in a fusion where no joint is visible between its beginning and its end. Nay, there is no beginning and no end, nor joining nor mending, but rather there is casting and molding.",

    "text": "In his book \"Masa'id al-Nazar lil-Ishraf 'ala Maqasid al-Suwar\" (The Ascending Steps of View for Overseeing the Objectives of the Surahs), he states that \"Every Surah has a single objective around which its beginning and end revolve, and evidence is provided for it within. The premises indicating it are arranged in the most precise manner and the most creative approach. If there is something in it that requires proof, it is proven, and so on for the proof of the proof, and so forth. When the matter reaches its conclusion, it concludes with what the beginning started from. Then the speech bends back to it, and the view returns to it, on a creative path and a formidable ascent different from the first. Thus, the Surah becomes like a verdant, tall tree and a delightful, elegant, adorned dome, decorated with types of ornaments organized after the elegance of leaves with branches of pearls. Its branches bend back to those cut-off points like circles. Each circle among them has a branch connected to what is before it, and a branch fused with what is after it. The end of the Surah has joined its beginning just as its termination has soldered to what follows it, and its commencement has embraced what preceded it. So every Surah became like a great circle comprising circles of verses, radiant in arrangement, wondrous in assembly, with the gentleness of the sympathy of its branches and the goodness of the connection of its fruits and boughs\" (1). The statement of the circular structure of the Surah does not contradict the statement of the ascent of meaning in its construction on one hand, nor the ascent in the entire Holy Quranic context. This is because the ascent is not based on a cumulative pattern but on a generative methodology. This considers that meanings in the Quranic Surah procreate to circle around a single axis, which is the axis of the circle that Al-Biqa'i calls: The Greatest Objective. So every Surah is like a circle whose meanings generate and ascend to form a circle, and the other Surah is a circle whose generated, ascending meanings revolve around an axis (Greatest Objective) built upon an axis (Greatest Objective) around which the generated, ascending meanings in the preceding Surah revolved. And you hear him affirming that in what I quoted to you from his explanation in his book \"Masa'id al-Nazar\".",

    "text": "He pays great attention to contemplating and interpreting the relationship of the Surah's recitation ending (Maqta' al-Tartil) with its reading opening (Matla' al-Tilawah), and revealing to you the landmarks of closeness between the two meanings existing in the Opening and the Ending. Our saying \"two meanings\" does not mean they differ by separation, but means they vary in degrees of clarification, depiction, and rhetorical derivation; otherwise, in every meaning, there is a single dominant universal. They are, in the world of Quranic rhetoric, like the relationship of the firstborn child in labor to his sibling who is last in birth. I have indicated before that by our saying (Matla') we mean the opening of the reading, and by our saying (Maqta') we mean the ending of the recitation/arrangement; they are two terms not intended to denote the relationship of meanings to each other per se, but rather looking at the matter of reading and recitation. Al-Biqa'i did not leave any Surah, even if its number of words and verses were few, without explaining the relationship of its ending in arrangement to its opening in reading. There is no difference for him in this between the shortest Surah (Al-Kawthar) and the longest Surah (Al-Baqarah). In his interpretation, he does not look at the general meaning of the Opening and the Ending, but looks at the essence of the meaning linked to the axis of the Surah (its Greatest Objective). For the general meanings of the verses of the Surah might not show the landmarks of their proportionality and generation from the Greatest Objective to the passing glance, but the essence of the meaning and its spirit is what the contemplator sees the landmarks of proportionality between them on one hand, and generation from the Greatest Objective on the other. In his interpretation of returning the ending of Surah \"Al-Baqarah\" to its \"opening\", he says when interpreting the saying of Allah Almighty {The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and the believers...} (Al-Baqarah: from verse 285): \"As for its appropriateness to the beginning of the Surah by returning the ending to the opening, it is that when He began the Surah by describing the believers with the Book in which there is no doubt in the manner that preceded, He concluded it with that after detailing the spending with which He described them in its beginning, in a manner that connects to what preceded of commands and prohibitions and characterizing with attributes of perfection in the strongest connection.",

    "text": "And He made the Messenger (peace be upon him) their head to honor the praise and encourage that description. So He informed of their belief in what was revealed to him specifically and in all Books and all Messengers, and of their statement indicating complete desire and the utmost humility and submission. So He said, resuming as an answer to one who seemed to say: 'What did he do upon whom these commands and prohibitions and others were revealed?' (The Messenger believed)...\" (1) Then he says after interpreting the last two verses in the arrangement: ... \"And it has become clear by mentioning the Revelation, belief in it, and victory over the disbelievers after detailing the matter of expenditure and the wealth that is spent from, the return of its ending to its opening, and its last to its first\" (2). The proportionality between what Surah Al-Baqarah opened with in reading—speaking about the Holy Quran, belief in it, spending, guidance, and success—and what it concluded with in arrangement—speaking about the belief of the Messenger (peace be upon him) and the belief of the believers in the Holy Quran, their conduct, and what they have—is evident. You do not see artificiality in stating it or pointing to it, nor ambiguity in explaining its landmarks. Everyone of insight whom you alert pays attention and finds rest, while people of deep insight are in no need of alerting and indication. And its relationship to the objective of the Surah, which is establishing belief in the Unseen—the highest of which is belief in Allah Almighty and belief in the Last Day and what is in it—is not hidden. For its end establishes belief in what was revealed, belief in Allah, the Angels, the Books they did not see, and belief in the Messengers they did not meet, making no distinction between any of them out of certainty in the truth of the news about them. All of this is belief in the Unseen. This supplication, invocation, and hope for salvation on the Day of Resurrection is from belief in the Unseen. Thus, the proportionality of the Surah's recitation ending with its reading opening becomes clear to you on one hand, and their generation from the Greatest Objective on the other. *** And in Surah \"Al-A'raf\", he does not suffice with returning the last verse or two to the opening of the Surah, but returns twenty-eight verses from its end to its beginning.",

And 'Al-Din' had concluded with the stingiest of misers and the lowest of traits: Withholding, to alienate from stinginess and from the denial it brings. So 'Al-Kawthar' began with the most generous generosity and giving to the most noble of creatures to encourage it and call to it [Meaning that the clear statement of Al-Kawthar is opposite to the clear statement of Al-Ma'un]. So it was as if it was said: You, O best of creation, are not clothed in anything of what that [Surah] concluding with withholding assistance (Al-Ma'un) forbade (Indeed, We have granted you... Al-Kawthar) which is part of the generosity towards those who believe in the Day of Judgment.\" (1) The relationship of Al-Kawthar to Al-Din becomes clear to you, and that it is a relationship of contrast between the clear statements of the two Surahs on one hand, and correspondence between the clear statement of Al-Kawthar and the implication of \"Al-Din\" on the other. And it becomes clear to you that the initiation of \"Al-Kawthar\" with clear statement establishes the Divine Giving to the Prophet (peace be upon him). If you look at its conclusion {Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off}, you see in the structure of its arrangement an indication that cutting off and prevention from every sensory and moral good is specific to the enemy of the Honored, Revered One (peace be upon him). This implies that he (peace be upon him) is the one connected to the magnificent giving, granted every possible good. So what its recitation ending conveyed is what the clear statement of its reading opening indicated, thus the glorious proportionality between the Ending and the Opening was achieved. Al-Biqa'i says: \"When He commanded him to occupy time in worshiping the Creator and doing good to the creatures with the highest character, He justified it with what implies that he has no distraction nor any need that befalls him at all. So He said: {Indeed, your enemy... is} i.e., specifically {the one cut off (Al-Abtar)} meaning cut off from his root, cut off from offspring, destitute, and cut off from good, blessing, and mention; no one succeeds him to take care of his affairs or mention him, even if he gathered wealth and emptied his body for every beauty.

The concept of returning the Ending to the Opening, or the 'Ajuz (last foot) to the Sadr (first foot) as rhetoricians say, is something the creative eloquent ones in the world of high expression cared for in the past, and rhetorical critics drew attention to its value. \"Ibn al-Mu'tazz\" made it in his book: \"Al-Badi'\" the fourth pillar or chapter of the five chapters of Badi' upon which he established his book Al-Badi'. If the attention of rhetoricians in this style was towards the correspondence of a word in the end of the verse or paragraph with another that preceded it—a correspondence in pronunciation that might be combined with correspondence in concept (meaning) or might not—then the matter here with Al-Biqa'i goes beyond phonetic correspondence first to semantic correspondence. And the correspondence goes beyond the scope of the word to a wider scope that may reach several verses. In this, there is a transfer of the style of returning endings to beginnings from verbal embellishment among the Badi' scholars to the Arrangement Order (*Nazm Tartibi*) based on the relationships of meanings to each other according to \"Al-Biqa'i\", and that type of Order is the Exalted, the Praiseworthy. *** The Sixth Feature. Relationships of Verses in the Construction of the Node (*Ma'qid*). The Quranic Surah, in its circular structure whose parts are generated from a main axis: {Greatest Objective} around which it revolves and which dominates its components and contents, consists of nodes, and each node consists of proportionate, generated verses. I have indicated before that the Surah in Quranic expression is composed of nodes (*Ma'aqid*), and each node is composed of verses, and each verse of sentences, and each sentence of words. The status of the word to the sentence is the status of the organ to the individual, and the status of the sentence to the verse is the status of the individual to the family.",

    "text": "And the status of the verse to the Node is the status of the family to the clan (Batn), and the status of the Node to the Surah is the status of the clan to the tribe, and the status of the Surah to the Quran is the status of the tribe to the human race. And that the Holy Quranic expression has a Greatest Objective from which Quranic meanings generate and to which they belong. I said this is only an approximation, not a depiction, for how can what belongs to the World of Command be depicted by what belongs to the World of Creation? If we have looked at the construction of Quranic expression in terms of Surahs and the relationship of Surahs to each other: objectives, endings, and openings, and we have looked at the establishment of Quranic expression in Surahs upon a central axis around which the meanings of the Surah revolve, and we have explained \"Al-Biqa'i's\" methodology in interpreting the ascent of meaning in the Surah as you heard in his interpretation of the construction of expression in Surah \"Al-Baqarah\", then we shall look at the construction of the Node from verses and the interconnection or proportionality of these verses. Al-Biqa'i in his interpretation does not resort to satisfying himself with linking the verse to the one immediately following it in reading; rather, he may look and see the proportionality of a verse to a verse preceding it in reading with several verses between them. Rhetoricians and exegetes before had attention to what is known as conjoining story upon story. The statement of conjunction in the correlation of verses is not the unique methodology in this correlation, for the relationships of verses go beyond what can be termed as Attachment (*Ta'liq* / tying) where a linguistic factor is responsible for that tie or attachment, to Interlocking (*Ta'aluq* / mutual bond) where a moral, internal factor is responsible for that interlocking. In their naming of this type of attachment as \"Conjunction\" (*'Atf* - also meaning sympathy/affection) is a subtle meaning: as if meanings sympathize with each other, like the sympathy of a loving mother for her newborn or a lover for his beloved. Relationships exist between the conjoined and the conjoined-to, and there is nothing in life that sympathizes with something it has no connection with. So is the matter in the world of Expression, as it is the world of Man; methodologies, doctrines, and landmarks of beauty approximate in each.",

    "text": "Among relationships are those of symmetry, some of support, and some of sympathy. So relationships of meanings vary, and their tools vary. If we were to look into rhetorical and linguistic terminology in the field of meaning relationships to see the semantic differences between them, their variety, and what they converge upon, this would enrich the jurisprudence of relations of expression, choosing for each type of relationship between meanings the term most specific and appropriate to it. The important thing is that \"Al-Biqa'i\" quotes from \"Al-Harralli\": \"That in every verse there is a meaning by which it is organized with what precedes it, and a meaning by which it is prepared to be organized with what follows it. Thereby, the organization of verses is included in the meaning of inimitability (I'jaz) which creation cannot produce the like of, even if they were assistants to one another\" (1). Hence, we see Al-Biqa'i making the Order (*Nazm*) in Quranic expression into two orders: Compositional Order (*Nazm Tarkibi*) and Arrangement Order (*Nazm Tartibi*). He says: \"Inimitability has two paths: One is the ordering of every sentence on its own according to composition. The second: Ordering it with its sister considering arrangement. The first is closer to grasp and easier to taste, for everyone who hears the Quran... is moved by its meanings, and upon hearing it, acquires an awe with vigor and fear with expansion that does not occur when hearing other than it. The more one scrutinizes the meaning, the greater the position of inimitability becomes to him. Then, if the astute one crosses from that to contemplating the link of every sentence to what followed it and what it followed, that becomes hidden to him, and he sees that sentences have distant purposes and remote objectives, so he thinks they are discordant. Thus, he acquires from contraction and distress multiples of what he acquired by hearing of vibration and expansion....",

Indeed, You are the Bestower} (Al-Imran: 8), then that door opens for him, and behind it flash the lights of those secrets. The thought dances from it in joy, and they thank Allah in astonishment and wonder, and his heart burns for the greatness of that, so his faith becomes firmly established without doubt\" (1). If we look at Surah \"An-Nahl\" for example, we see it consists of an introduction, a conclusion, and four Nodes: The Introduction is the first [verse]. The First Node is from the second verse to the twenty-first (2-21). The Second is from the twenty-second to the sixty-fourth (22-64). The Third is from the sixty-fifth to the eighty-ninth (65-89). The Fourth is from verse ninety to verse one hundred and twenty-four (90-124). And the Conclusion is the last four verses (125-128). When we reflect, we find that \"Al-Biqa'i\" has made the Third Node conjoined by its opening to the ending of the First Node, i.e., Verse (65) to Verse (19). The reason is that the First Node of Surah An-Nahl is dedicated to providing evidence through Allah's blessings for His Oneness, Power, Knowledge, and Perfection. The Third Node is also dedicated to establishing a new type of evidence through blessings for His Oneness... evidence in which the meaning of gratitude/bounty appears, whereas in the verses of the First Node, the evidence [aspect] was more apparent than the gratitude. As for the verses of the Second Node, they are like a parenthetical sentence between the First and Third Nodes. The verses of this Third Node stand to explain and refute the objections of the polytheists. So there is a resemblance between the location of this Third Node and its content, which is a marvelous type of resemblance between location and content.",

All verses of the Node speak about blessings indicating the Oneness of Allah, His Knowledge, Power, and Choice. The first evidence is Unseen evidence whose effects are seen and heard, but senses do not perceive it: sending down angels with revelation and creating heavens and earth. The second, connected to it without a linguistic connector, is Witnessed evidence that can be observed, especially in our era: creating man from a sperm-drop. Conjoining upon it a Witnessed evidence that shares with man being created from a drop: the creation of cattle... (Verses: 5-9). Then comes an evidence from blessings spread out, sharing with the animal world in being a blessing subjected to man (10-16). This third evidence used for the Oneness of the Benefactor and the perfection of His Knowledge, Power, and Choice has had its verses arranged in a marvelous manner making them three worlds: First World: The Exposed World surrounded by air (Verses: 10-13). Second World: The Submerged Descending World (Seas) (Verse: 14). Third World: The Towering World (Mountains) (Verses: 15-16). Then comes the ending of the Node standing with rebuking denial for those who equate the One who creates that marvelous creation indicating His Oneness... with one who does not create anything. The verses of the Node interconnect and are arranged in a marvelous sequence that no one has the power to advance or delay. As you look at the types of linking, you find some are internal moral linking as in the first verses of this Node, and some are linking by a linguistic connector, as in the verses of the last evidence of the Node's verses. The context does not allow detailing the interconnection between verses of every Node in the Surah. Looking into Al-Biqa'i's interpretation of the proportionality of verses of this Node reveals to you many of the landmarks of his methodology in this\" (1). *** He may present several faces in linking the verse to what preceded it, not satisfying himself with one face, as you see in explaining the placement of Allah Almighty's saying:",

And in that was a warning to those who sought to tread that Straight Path from their condition, and a notification that the pious who are answered in the supplication for guidance are not upon anything of that; rather they said: 'Guide us', out of certainty and sincerity, absolving themselves of claims and objection to Messengers. He alerted that whoever acted contrary to their action, and believed from among them or others from all denominations, was upon the contrary of their condition with their Lord. So He is not angry with them, but pays them their rewards in full, and bequeaths them security and joy implying the opposite of humiliation and misery. So He said: {Indeed, those who believed}. Or it is said: When He Almighty justified the humiliation of the Children of Israel by their disobedience and transgression, it was as if it was said: 'So what is for the one who obeyed?' So it was answered with a general answer for them and others. Or it is said: When He Almighty informed that they were made to wear disgrace like a dove's necklace, and that might have given the illusion that there is no escape for them from it even if they repented—and His custom Almighty was running that if He mentioned a promise or a threat He followed it with a ruling of its opposite so the speech would be complete—know that the door of repentance is open, and the Lord is Generous in a general manner.\"",

It started with mentioning the Revealer of the Quran [meaning the one commanded to carry the revelation and send it down: Gabriel peace be upon him]; because their enmity to the one it was revealed to for the sake of what was revealed to him is enmity to its Revealer; because he is the cause of what the enmity was for.

As if he indicates by this that the Holy Quran strengthens the bond of necessary meanings—by virtue of being necessary to it—with the stated meanings, so it suffices with the indication of this bond instead of explicitly mentioning these necessary meanings to which what follows the declared is conjoined. So he brings what follows the conjunction returned to an implied [meaning] which is in severe necessity of expression for it, like the explicitly mentioned. Thus, the rhetorical fabric of Quranic meanings is based on a method of weaving where some silk threads hide in the brocade fabric, hardly appearing to the casual eye but appearing to the penetrating insight. Hence, you see the predominance of going to Brevity by Omission in Al-Biqa'i's interpretation of the pattern of Quranic expression, especially omitting the conjoined-to estimated from the womb of meaning in the previous explicitly mentioned sentence.

He says: \"When the evidence that their hearts are denying out of arrogance and what relates to it ended, and He concluded it with what He gives life to hearts with—Faith and Knowledge after their death by Disbelief and Ignorance—and the Greatest Objective of the Quran was establishing four principles: Divinities (Theology), Prophecies, the Hereafter, and establishing Decree and Destiny and Action by Choice; and the greatest of these objectives was Divinities, He began with proofs of Oneness, Power, and Action by Choice necessitating the ability to Resurrect in a manner different from the preceding.

So He conjoined to His saying Almighty {And Allah knows what you conceal and what you declare} a comprehensive saying in evidence between the Upper World and the Lower World {And Allah has sent down rain from the sky...}\" (1). This is based on what is known among rhetoricians as conjoining story upon story, which is a method of meaning relationships. Al-Biqa'i himself emphasizes that the method of relationships between meanings in the Quranic Surah is like the method of relationships of branches, twigs, and boughs of a tree. The discussion on the relationship of verses to each other is vast and hardly encompassed. It is built upon what scholars agreed upon that the arrangement of verses is *Tawqifi* (divinely ordained) brought by Revelation. No one among the worlds—angel or prophet—had an intervention in it. You hardly find anyone attributed to knowledge claiming that the arrangement of verses in the Surah is an Ijtihad (reasoning) from a Companion, Prophet, or Angel.",

The Seventh Feature. Interpreting the Order (*Nazm*) in Quranic Stories. The Quranic expression about Allah Almighty's will for His servants came mixing two contexts: A legislative context whose pillar is Command and Prohibition with their differing paths and forms, and an educational context whose pillar is Encouragement and Intimidation. Hardly does one context strip itself of the company of the other; they exist together, even if the degrees of appearance of one and subtlety of the other vary. The Holy Quranic Stories are a type of psychological and spiritual education through encouragement and intimidation. Insights penetrating its depth perceive a flux of degrees of assignment with Ehsan-based meanings for a group that ascended in their march to their Lord from the lower degree of obedience to Allah Almighty to a higher degree: ascended from the age of \"Those who believed\" to the age of \"The Believers\" and above them to the honor of the age of \"The Doers of Good (Muhsinin)\" who worship Allah Almighty as if they see Him with the eye of insight. The Holy Quran establishes the status of Stories and their majestic message in several noble verses: {Indeed, this is the true narration. And there is no deity except Allah. And indeed, Allah is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.} (Al-Imran: 62) {So relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought.} (Al-A'raf: 176) {We relate to you, [O Muhammad], the best of stories in what We have revealed to you of this Qur'an although you were, before it, among the unaware.} (Yusuf: 3)",

A careful look at the statement of this last verse which concludes Surah \"Yusuf\"—existing as a complete story where no scene was repeated contrary to the rhetorical Sunnah in the Holy Quran regarding Quranic stories—tempts you to contemplate His saying Almighty: {A lesson (*Ibrah*) for those of understanding}. As if in this is an indication that the crossing (*'Ubur*) from busying oneself with the apparent event narrated in those stories and what the narrative scene established therein, to what is the erected goal for which this story was driven, is only for those of understanding (Ulul-Albab). The Holy Quran attaches *Tadhakkur* (Remembrance)—which is summoning what one had previous knowledge of—to them. So the Holy Quranic Stories are only for taking lessons. And by contemplating His saying Almighty: {Never was the Qur'an a narration invented, but a confirmation of what was before it, and a detailed explanation of all things...}, this reveals the reality of these stories which no other stories can approach, and which nothing that times throw up will ever be able to belie a majestic or minute matter of. And by contemplating His saying Almighty: {and guidance and mercy for a people who believe}, this is a clear indication that these stories guide in a manner befitting their worth only those who uphold the belief that what they hear of these stories is not fabrication nor the product of imagination and wandering in every valley, but a confirmation of what is before it of the True Books which Allah Almighty revealed to His messengers, peace be upon them.

Above this, they are divergent in message and goal. This necessitates a divergence between them in the methodology of clarification and depiction. Hence, it is not from the objectivity of interpretation as Quranic rhetoric, nor the objectivity of criticism as literary creativity, to take from the methodology of literary criticism—Arabic or foreign—for artistic stories what the Muslim reads the landmarks of rhetorical inimitability of the Holy Quranic Stories with. *** Al-Biqa'i contemplates the chapters of stories and their events, highlighting the proportionality of that with the context and the intent of the Surah. He may draw a comparison between the locations of a single story in multiple Surahs, highlighting the similarity of Compositional and Arrangement Order in the story. Al-Biqa'i's essay regarding Quranic Stories is a vast essay that papers like these cannot accommodate. It is worthy of having a scientific research dedicated to it, encompassing the gold nuggets scattered in the context of his interpretation of the Holy Quranic expression according to the principles of the science of Quranic Proportionality he has. We are only pointing to some of what incites undertaking the examination of what Al-Biqa'i's essay was in this. He says about \"The Science of Proportions\": \"By it, the secrets of repeated stories become clear to you, and that every Surah in which a story was repeated, it was for a meaning more called for in that Surah, evidenced by that story, other than the meaning for which it was driven in the previous Surah. From here, wordings differed according to those purposes, and orders changed by delaying, advancing, brevity, and elaboration, while nothing of that contradicts the original meaning by which the story was formed\" (1).",

    "text": "This, from \"Al-Biqa'i\", is a great principle of Rhetorical Interpretation of the Holy Quran, looking at the status of the Context and the Purpose for which speech is established in understanding the meaning and tasting the rhetoric. It indicates that Quranic expression does not contain sterile repetition, but is towards rhetorical derivation in depicting meanings, which grants the recipient a flood of semantic giving that repels the calamity of boredom and weariness. It is the Expression that does not wear out with much repetition, and its wonders do not end. Among what he said in interpreting the stories in Surah \"Al-A'raf\": \"Know that there is no repetition in these stories, for every context of them is for a matter whose like has not preceded. The purpose of the story of 'Moses' (peace be upon him) and 'Pharaoh' (upon him be curse and blame) is this existential evidence for His saying: 'And We found most of them to be defiantly disobedient'. From here you know that the context of the story of the Children of Israel after salvation from their enemy is to explain their haste into disbelief and breaking of covenants. He Almighty continued in this evidence until the end of the Surah. And how appropriate His saying Almighty: {And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, \"Yes, we have testified.\" [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, \"Indeed, we were of this unaware.\"} (Al-A'raf: 172) is to His saying Almighty: {And We did not find for most of them any covenant; but indeed, We found most of them defiantly disobedient.} (Al-A'raf: 102). And He mentioned in the beginning of the one following it [Surah Al-Anfal] their dispute over spoils to warn them against being among the blameworthy majority in this one. This is contrary to the purpose of the context of the Children of Israel stories in 'Al-Baqarah', for there it is to solicit faith by reminding of blessings; because that is in the context of His address—Almighty—to all people by His saying: {O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous} (Al-Baqarah: 21).",

And Allah knows best\" (1). This indicates clearly that he sees a special context for every story and for every aspect/scene of its aspects, which dictates that this story be here and this aspect of it be [here], and its order be in this manner. *** Among what he is concerned with explaining is the arrangement of events in Quranic stories, and showing that the criterion for its arrangement is not the chronological succession of events in reality, but the Context and the General Purpose of the expression is what dictates presenting the news of an event ahead of the news of an event that preceded it in occurrence. You see something of this in the first story mentioned in the Arrangement Context of the Holy Quran: The story of our father Adam (peace be upon him) in Surah \"Al-Baqarah\": The news of commanding the angels to prostrate to Adam (peace be upon him) came after the news of teaching him the names and informing the angels of what they did not know. The implication of the apparent [text] to him is that the prostration was first, and the command to the angels to inform of the names of things was after it in reality, but the narrative expression came otherwise. He says: \"'Al-Baydawi' proceeded on [the view] that the command to prostrate was after informing of the names, and he did not mention a proof diverting from this apparent meaning (2).",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) - Nazm al-Durar: Vol 8, p 70 \n2. - Al-Baydawi says in his Tafsir (Anwar al-Tanzil): \"{And when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate to Adam'} When He informed them of the names and taught them what they did not know, He commanded them to prostrate to him as an acknowledgement of his virtue, fulfilling his right, and apologizing for what they said about him. It was said He commanded them before He fashioned his creation due to His saying Almighty {So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration} to test them and show his virtue\" (Anwar al-Tanzil - Vol 2, p 130). Al-Shihab Al-Khafaji comments in his footnote \"Inayat al-Qadi\" (2/130) on Al-Baydawi's saying (It was said...): \"The author, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, indicated [by saying: It was said] his lack of approval, and did not point to the answer to his deduction from the verse [i.e., then fall down], which is that the 'Fa' (Then) of answer does not necessitate immediate sequence, as in His saying Almighty: {When the call is made for prayer on Friday, then proceed to the remembrance of Allah}, for proceeding is not obligatory immediately after it...\"",

    "text": "However, proceeding upon it is better from the aspect of meaning; because the prostration of angels (peace be upon them) before [i.e., before manifesting the virtue of knowledge to Adam, peace be upon him] would be belief in the Unseen based on the rule of assignment. But after manifesting the virtue of knowledge, the cover was removed, and the facet of virtue became from the chapter of Certainty of Sight ('Ain al-Yaqin). As for the arrangement in mention here in this manner, placing prostration after informing, it is for a marvelous subtlety: It is that He Almighty, as He was in the explanation of blessings necessitating His thanks by singling Him out for worship for being a Benefactor, explained first His blessing upon every soul in its individuality by creating it and pouring provision upon it [referring to verses: 21-22]. Then He reminded all of a blessing encompassing them, which is His argumentation with the closest of His creation to Him at that time regarding our father Adam (peace be upon him) before creating him. The Wise Style required clarifying the proof of the virtue of this Caliph to them, so He mentioned what He gave him of knowledge. When He finished arguing with them with what necessitated their submission, He reminded his sons of the blessing of prostration to him. So presenting the manifestation of the virtue of knowledge was only to preserve the good context in arranging the proof on the most upright method and clearest path\" (1). \"Al-Biqa'i\" highlights, as you see, the effect of Context and the Purpose for which speech is established on the Arrangement Order of the story's events, and how they might dictate presenting an event in mention over an event preceding in the occurrence of the story. So consideration is for what the Situation and Station require. ***",

Most of what the Holy Quran related of stories, those informed about and whose news was told were not speakers of the Arabic tongue. But the Holy Quran depicted with the clear Arabic tongue their precise meanings existing in their foreign tongues and the meanings hidden in their chests which Allah Almighty created and knew their secrets. {And conceal your speech or publicize it; indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts. * Does He who created not know, while He is the Subtle, the Acquainted?} (Al-Mulk: 13-14). {He knows the traitor of the eyes, and what the chests conceal.} (Ghafir: 19).

It may be said that since among what they slighted was the Sabbath by hastening to extinguish countless souls they were forbidden from (whales), and in the story of 'The Cow' was obstinacy and slowness regarding extinguishing one soul they were commanded to, He followed it with it\" (1).

He says: \"When the story was divided into two halves to alert to the two blessings: the blessing of pardon for pausing regarding the command, and the blessing of clarification for the killer by the supernatural command; and to alert that they have two rebukes thereby: one for bad manners in accusing of mockery and pausing from compliance, and the second for killing the soul and what followed it.

It is clear that one of the methodologies of the Holy Quranic Expression is detailing its Surahs into verses. These verses—their detailing and designation of reading opening and ending—was not based on a linguistic rhetorical basis. Look at the saying of Allah Almighty: {Have you seen the one who forbids * A servant when he prays?} (Al-Alaq: 9-10). The Truth, Majestic is His Majesty, made the reading opening of the second verse the object of the verb He made the reading ending of the verse preceding it. This indicates that the matter is not returned to a linguistic criterion, even if such is not dominant in detailing the Surah into verses, especially verses that are extended, formed of several sentences which may have grammatical relationships or contextual relationships between them. Al-Biqa'i has glorious attention to interpreting the Arrangement Order of sentences in the construction of the verse, especially extended verses where the grammatical sentence holds the status of the word in the sentence.",

This is due to him considering the Arrangement Order (*Nazm Tartibi*) higher in rank in contemplating the proportionality of the Holy Quran than the Compositional Order (*Nazm Tarkibi*). He considers standing upon it as something specific to the Imams of knowledge. As for the Compositional Order based on sentence construction, that is something many can easily stand upon and master understanding. He says while explaining the subject of the Science of Proportionality: \"Its subject is the parts of the thing whose suitability is sought from the aspect of arrangement. Its fruit is viewing the rank the part deserves because of the connection and attachment it has to what is behind it and in front of it, which is like the bond of kinship\" (1). And he says: \"By this science—meaning the Science of Munasabat (Proportions)—faith becomes firmly established in the heart and settles in the intellect. That is because it reveals that Inimitability has two paths: One is ordering every sentence on its own according to Composition. The second: Ordering it with its sister considering Arrangement. The first is closer to grasp and easier to taste...\" (2). Perhaps the ease of interpreting Compositional Order in sentence construction relative to interpreting Arrangement Order of compound sentences in verse construction is because Compositional Order has an objective reference in grammatical relationships between meanings of words. This is what Abdul Qahir called *Al-Nazm* (3).",

Rather, if you look at his book: (Dala'il al-I'jaz), you see a stance from him regarding a statement by Al-Jahiz in the introduction of Kitab al-Hayawan saying: ((May Allah keep you from doubt and protect you from confusion... etc.)) which he did not consider of the Order by which virtue is mandatory (Dala'il: p 97-98). Despite every sentence being established from high Compositional Order wherein meanings of grammar were sought between meanings of its words, if it lacked Arrangement Order between sentences—whose pillar is Context and Purpose for which speech is set—you could advance a sentence over a sentence without the building demolishing.",

What is such, its matter is easier relative to what is not returned to an objective criterion like Compositional Order; for its reference is contextual, intentional, i.e., referring to the context of speech in the wideness of its circles: the circle of verse construction, the circle of Node construction, the circle of Surah construction, and the circle of the entire Quranic Expression construction. Whenever the circle widens, the hearing and sight become subtler, so hearings and sights vary. The sentence looked at in its Arrangement Order in verse construction might be an extended sentence embracing within its womb numerous smaller sentences linked to it by compositional linkage based on grammatical relationships. What concerns us here is the relationships of grammatical sentences established from Compositional Order to form, by the Arrangement Order between them, a verse of the Surah's verses. That is where Arrangement Order exists. This [order] existing between sentences in verse construction is the narrowest field of Arrangement Order, whose fields may widen to ordering verses in constructing Nodes, ordering Nodes in constructing the Surah, then ordering Surahs and arranging them to achieve the Arrangement Context of the Holy Quran opening recitation with Surah Al-Fatihah and concluding recitation with Surah Al-Nas. I have previously looked at what is higher than the field of Arrangement Order between sentences for verse construction. The Quranic verse may be formed from a collection of grammatical sentences, each having its syntactic independence. However, despite that, the meaning of speech is not complete except with the sum of these grammatical sentences, nor can you stand upon the full rhetorical meaning of the speech except with the sum of these grammatical sentences. If you look at Ayat al-Kursi, you find it to be nine grammatical sentences, or ten sentences if we say the Name of Majesty is a sentence with one pillar deleted indicated by the estimated question: Whose is the Sovereignty today? Which is what Al-Biqa'i went to. The grammatical meaning in every sentence does not lack the preceding one according to grammarians, even if generated from it.",

    "text": "These grammatical sentences are elements of a single Quranic (rhetorical) sentence. You do not stand upon the Holy Quranic meaning of this verse from a single grammatical sentence. For the Rhetorical Quranic meaning that made this verse the Mistress of Quranic verses, as the Sunnah guided to, is not established by the first grammatical sentence alone (Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence) but one must encompass all sentences built upon it. The first grammatical sentence here is the Key Sentence and the Base Sentence upon which the rest of the sentences were built in constructing and forming the Quranic meaning of this Quranic sentence. Al-Biqa'i was concerned with interpreting the Mistress of Holy Quranic verses: Ayat al-Kursi in his interpretation, and dedicated a book to it: *Al-Fath al-Qudsi fi Tafsir Ayat al-Kursi*. Let us look at his interpretation of the Arrangement Order of this verse's sentences in his Tafsir. He says: \"When He Almighty began Al-Fatihah, as passed, by mentioning the Essence, then made Himself known through actions because they are witnessed, then ascended the address to definition by Attributes, then elevated it back to the Essence to qualify for knowledge, He began this Surah with the attribute of Speech; because it is the greatest of miracles, the clearest and most indicative of the Unseen Essence, and the most impactful on souls, especially among the Arabs. Then He made Himself known through actions, increasing them. When no ambiguity remained, He established Oneness with its preceding verse, interspersing that with varieties of wisdom, beauties of rulings, and types of encouragement and intimidation in precise description and arrangement. When the commands were complete and those deterrents were terrifying, and souls yearned, and thoughts looked forward to knowing the cause of the severing of connection by the cutting of ties and the negation of intercession on that Day—since it was familiar from worldly kings that they are hardly enabled in any matter fully due to the abundance of intercessors and willing friends... He Almighty explained the attribute of the Commander regarding His Majesty, Greatness, effectiveness of command.....",

So He mentioned Ayat al-Kursi, the Mistress of Quranic verses, which no book contained the like of, opening it with the Unique Comprehensive Proper Name by which no other is named. That is when the listener qualified, after introduction by Speech and courtship by Actions, for the station of Knowledge, so he ascended to the apogee of Observation and the presence of Witnessing. So He said returning to the manifestation of Majesty gathering attributes of Majesty and Honor; because it is one of His greatest stations (Allah) i.e., He is the King on that Day. Then He established for Him attributes of perfection purified from impurities of deficiency, opening them with Exclusivity, so He said (There is no deity except Him)... And when He Almighty unified His Noble Self, He established His entitlement to that by His Life, and explained that the intended is Eternal Life by the description of Sustainment (*Qayyumiyyah*), so He said (The Ever-Living... The Sustainer). Then He explained His Sustainment and perfection of His Life by His saying Majestic is His Majesty (Neither drowsiness overtakes Him... nor sleep)... Then He explained this sentence by His saying Almighty (To Him belongs... whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth)... Then He explained what this sentence included by His saying, denying upon whoever might imagine that something exits His command so it is not specific to Him (Who is it that can intercede... with Him except by His permission) i.e., by His enabling; for whoever no one can oppose, it is clear that everything is in His grasp. All that is evidence of His exclusivity in Divinity... Then He explained all that passed by His saying Almighty (He knows what is [presently] before them... and what will be after them)...",

Thus what preceded became clear by that; because whoever has this Greatness in this precise management and perfected making has this Knowledge and this Power that nothing burdens. Therefore He said Almighty (And their preservation tires Him not...) in His Sustainment as it burdens others... And since His Loftiness and Greatness by Subjugation, Authority, and encompassing Perfection were not confined to what preceded, He conjoined to it His saying Majestic is His Majesty (And He is... the Most High... the Most Great) as indicated by opening the verse with the Greatest Proper Name gathering all meanings of Beautiful Names in Height and Greatness that understandings fall short of due to illusions overcoming them... It is known from this establishment that every sentence started anew is a cause for what preceded it, and that the last one is explanatory of the necessary consequence of Comprehensive Knowledge, which is Complete Power... So whoever claims partnership, let him preserve this universe, even for one year of years, and let him know what is acting in that year for his saying to be valid. And how can he do that, and how!!! It became clear by what was established for Him Almighty of Highness and Greatness that the disbeliever in Him is the Wrongdoer (Zalim), and that the Day of His manifestation for judgment will have no intercession nor friendship. As for trade (bargaining), they are in the busiest occupation from it. Even if Ransom is meant by it, it is known that there is no way to it and no stopping at it.

It fulfilled proofs of Tawhid in the most complete manner in the wisest system and most creative style, being purely for that.\" (1) It became clear to us from Al-Biqa'i's interpretation the relationships of the ten sentences forming Ayat al-Kursi, and that its Arrangement Order is based on the methodology of Ascent and Generation. Al-Biqa'i stated in the conclusion of his interpretation that every sentence is a cause for its predecessor and clarifying what is hidden in what preceded it. In justification (Ta'lil) is the meaning of Generation, and in clarification is the meaning of Ascent; because clarification does not stop at explaining what preceded and clarifying it, but adds new [meaning] to it. The other comes and clarifies it, so the meaning ascends to its peak, and lights of clarification condense, so no ambiguity remains in a meaning of the meanings of the Mistress of Holy Quranic verses, which is in reality the conclusion of the Quranic Meaning in Surah Al-Baqarah. What came after it of verses is only clarification, as stated by \"Al-Biqa'i\" in the opening of Surah \"Al-Imran\" (2). *** If you look at the \"Verse of Debt\" (Ayat al-Dayn) also, you see that it is a single Quranic (rhetorical) sentence despite being the most extended verse in the Holy Quran. You see the Conditional Style with its two sentences as the base upon which the rest of the verse (The Rhetorical Sentence) was built. What was arranged upon the Conditional Style in debt transactions is very numerous. At the end of the verse is a Conditional Style in sales (And take witnesses when you conclude a contract). He did not attach numerous sentences to it as He attached in the Conditional Style in debt transactions due to the differences between the two financial dealings. His saying Almighty (Take witnesses) is in reality conjoined to the Conditional Style at the beginning of the verse. So the meaning is: O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down, and when you conclude a contract [of sale], take witnesses.)",

    "text": "This is one face of the \"Waw\" (And) about which we can say that it initiates a new sentence about Sale after finishing the talk about Debt, due to subtle relationships between the two dealings. It is from conjoining story upon story with a connected womb between them. Thus, the simplest context for the Quranic Meaning has five stages: Stage of talking about Charities (v: 261-274), Stage of talking about Usury (Riba) (v: 275-281), Stage of talking about Debt (v: 282), Stage of talking about Sale (v: 282), and Stage of talking about Pledge (Rahn) (v: 283). The talk about the last two stages was brief, and about the first three stages was expanded. He made the talk about Riba flanked by talk about two majestic financial dealings; no one cares for his share in them among servants except one with great belief in the Unseen: Belief in Resurrection and the Last Day. That is the head of the Universal Meaning and Greatest Objective of Surah \"Al-Baqarah\". He combined the talk about Sale with the talk about Debt in one verse because Debt, in one of its faces, is a type of Sale except it is with Allah Almighty, for He is the One who guaranteed the return. Hence, interest taken from the debtor was forbidden because the contract of debt is originally a contract with Allah Majestic is His Majesty and not with the debtor; for Allah Almighty bears on behalf of the debtor what is the counter-value of the debt. Hence, the reward of the Good Loan (Qard Hasan) was higher than the reward of Charity. There is another indication for people of Ehsan: In every legal sale disciplined by Prophetic manners is a debt. Al-Bukhari narrated with his chain from Jabir bin Abdullah that the Prophet (peace be upon him and his family and companions and salutations abundant) said: \"May Allah have mercy on a man who is lenient when he sells, when he buys, and when he demands payment\" (Al-Bukhari - Book of Sales - Chapter: Ease and Lenience in Selling and Buying). As if what he was lenient in during sale and purchase is looking towards its reward in the Hereafter.",

The Ninth Feature. Contemplating the Compositional Order (*Nazm Tarkibi*) of Sentence Construction. I indicated before that Order (*Nazm*) according to \"Al-Biqa'i\" is of two types: Arrangement Order (*Nazm Tartibi*), whose narrowest fields is to be between grammatical sentences as they form the Quranic Verse construction, and the relationships between these sentences are contextual relationships, not parsing relationships with grammatical standards. I have looked at Al-Biqa'i's stance on interpreting that pattern of Order, and its status in the Rhetorical Inimitability of the Holy Quran. And Compositional Order (*Nazm Tarkibi*) which exists between elements of grammatical sentence construction, its basis being grammatical relationships between components of the sentence. It is clear that the grammatical sentence, even if its elements extend, multiply, and vary—being words and being sentences with the force of a single word (having a parsing position)—the basis of relationships is only the Predication relationship existing between Predicate (*Musnad*) and Subject (*Musnad Ilayh*). Then, upon that mother Predication relationship, other relationships are built such as relationship of dependency, annexation, or attachment... Some Quranic verses, even if composed of several sentences, if you look at this verse, you see relationships between its sentences are grammatical relationships. Nay, some Surahs are nothing but a grammatical sentence embracing in its context smaller sentences attached to each other grammatically.",

Hence, the entire Surah is established from Compositional Order, not Arrangement Order. This is what you see also in Surah (Say, \"He is Allah, [who is] One\"). Despite that, it is a miracle for all creation. \"Al-Biqa'i\", in his interpretation of Compositional Order in sentence construction, links the signification of composition and stylistic features to the near and far context and to the main purpose of the Surah sometimes. Although his explanation of the link of the sentence's compositional signification to the extended context of the sentence might be faint, unseen by one in haste. It is not hidden that the wider the circle of context, the more the relationship of sentence construction characteristics to it enters into subtlety that requires its contemplator to have a flood of intellectual intelligence and tasteful purity. ***** There is no doubt that styles and patterns of Compositional Construction are very numerous styles and patterns that can hardly be encompassed, let alone counted. This places us in the position of one compelled to take and leave, to summarize and not exhaust detailing in what he takes. There are two defects I cannot purify myself from: the defect of taking some styles and leaving others, and the defect of summarization or satisfying with some forms of the style. This is a heinous defect in scientific research I detest greatly. How I wished not to be stained by either of them, but the goal set for this research leaves me no room for avoidance. *** Among the Compositional Order cared for by Al-Biqa'i, for example, is Specification (*Takhsis*) and its paths, which rhetoricians call (Restriction/Exclusivity - *Al-Qasr*). It is clear that paths of Specification in Arabic are very numerous, even if rhetoricians' attention was to a type with specificity in signifying Specification. In their study of methods of Restriction, they chose specific methods (Negation and Exception, *Innama*, Preposing, Conjunction with *Bal* and *Lakin* and *La*, Pronoun of Separation, and Defining both terms).",

Not everything indicating Specification according to non-rhetoricians is of the terminological Specification according to rhetoricians which they call (Restriction - *Al-Qasr*).

    "foot_note": "1. (1) The Science of Bayan is the science concerned with studying methods of indicating meanings, and is not concerned with studying meanings themselves nor studying how to compose and author the image indicating the meaning. We must differentiate between studying the meaning itself as it is, studying the image indicating it in terms of its composition method, and studying the image of meaning in terms of the face of its indication and the method of its indication of that meaning. Every study of the method of indication of image on meaning is from the Science of Bayan, whatever the image: simile, preposing, omission, command, prohibition, separation and connection, torus, matching, or punning... etc. Hence, the Science of Bayan is vast, not limited to Simile, Metaphor, and Metonymy as some students might imagine. These three: Simile, Metaphor, and Metonymy are only the most apparent and famous, but Science of Bayan is not confined to them. Science of Ma'ani is the science pursuing the view into meanings as they are, and into authoring images indicating them. So the method of authoring between components of the style of الاحتباك (Deletion for brevity/Implication), or Folding and Spreading, or Employment, or Enallage (Iltifat), or Restriction and Release, or Emphasis, or Matching, or Pairing, or Good Division, and others is from Science of Ma'ani. So the difference between the two sciences is a difference in the methodology by which the style is studied, not a difference in the styles themselves studied by each science. It is not said Preposing, Omission, and Separation are from Science of Ma'ani alone, just as it is not said Simile is from Science of Bayan or Punning and Returning Endings are from Science of Badi'. The matter returns to the methodology of handling and study, not to the style being studied. Every style is studied in the three sciences with three methodologies; each science has its methodology.

    "text": "In his interpretation of Specification which rhetoricians call (*Al-Qasr*), he is concerned with matters including its methods, its signification, and the relationship of that to context and the near or far intent. Sometimes you see him stating that the method of \"Negation and Exception\" is the most explicit type of Restriction. He says regarding the saying of Allah Almighty: {So I have warned you of a Fire which is blazing. * None will [enter to] burn therein except the most wretched one. * Who had denied and turned away.} (Al-Layl: 14-16): \"Since it had preceded more than once the specification of each of the Doer of Good and the Doer of Evil with his abode by way of Restriction, rejecting that a doer of good be equated with a doer of evil in anything, and Restriction by (La - No) and (Illa - Except) is its most explicit type, He said (None will burn therein) i.e., suffer its heat and severity by way of necessity and immersion (except the most wretched) i.e., who is at the peak of wretchedness, and he is the Disbeliever\" (1). Observe his saying \"its most explicit type\". This indicates he is looking at the method and degree of its indication of the meaning of Restriction. This is from the characteristics of the Science of Bayan \"A science by which presenting a single meaning in different ways of clarity of indication is known\" as \"Al-Khatib\" says in \"Al-Idah\". He explains to us the reason the Station required expression with the most explicit method of Specification: Negation and Exception. The Station dictates that there be no ambiguity at all in distinguishing between the destiny of the Doer of Good and the Doer of Evil and the abode of each in his Hereafter. So it was necessary that Restriction be by a tool whose indication of restriction is by *Wad'* (linguistic assignment), wherein no one hesitates, and which has no indication of anything else in any other context. Negation and Vacated Exception provides the meaning of Restriction by way of *Wad'* - and you do not find this method indicating other than specification in any case, unlike *Innama* or Preposing or Definition.... And Al-Biqa'i looks in another place at Restriction by Negation and Exception, and selecting it from among other methods of Restriction.",

And Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. And they will have a painful punishment.} (Al-Baqarah: 174). If you look at this sentence, you see that the predicate of the Subject expressed by the demonstrative pronoun came as a sentence built from a style of Restriction whose method is Negation and Exception. The gaze stops at two words from the elements of this sentence located in the position of the predicate: \"consume/eat\" and \"the Fire\". One might calculate that in each is a semantic shift (metaphor). But Al-Biqa'i sees in selecting Negation and Exception as methods of Restriction in the verse a preventer preventing the assumption of metaphor. He says: \"In mentioning it with the form of Restriction is a negation of the interpreter's interpretation of it being a cause [i.e., cause of fire], and diverting it to the face of reality which revelation attains but senses fall short of. They were in that like the numbed person whose hand is in the water but he does not feel it. This indicates the death of the senses of these people regarding the state of what they consumed\" (1). The context of the verse speaks about those rabbis concealing what Allah Almighty revealed to buy a small price with it. That is the lowest a person busy with knowledge or affiliated with it can reach. So \"Al-Biqa'i\" explained that the explicit mention of His saying Almighty (into their bellies) fits with the giving of Restriction, as they lift the assumption of metaphor in eating or fire. Both are reality, not metaphor (2).",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) - Nazm al-Durar: 2 / 351 \n2. - There is a significant matter in this related to the statement of metaphor in some words of the Holy Quran or its structures. It is thought that its indication of what was sensory of its meanings is a real indication, and what was abstract of them, its indication was metaphorical, like here, and like Blindness in Allah's saying: ((And whoever is blind in this [life] will be blind in the Hereafter...)) (Al-Isra: 73). The basis of this for those who say it is their calculation that the First Man did not use words except in sensory indication. When he rose culturally, he perceived abstracts, so he borrowed for them from words what resembles them in sensory things... This is a misleading calculation: The First Man in the guidance of the Book and Sunnah is Adam, father of humans. He is a Prophet whom Allah Almighty created with His hand and taught him all names and dwelled him in Paradise, the model of sensory and abstract beauty. So he was never oblivious to abstract significations of words. Words accommodate indicating many sensory and abstract significations without preference by priority or precedence of assignment or otherwise, even if degrees of clarity in indicating these significations vary. It is not a variation of assignment (*Wad'*). So the indication of the word \"Blindness\" on losing the eye of the heart (Sight) ability to perceive sensory things is not the real assigned indication, and its indication on losing the eye of the heart (Insight) to perceive abstracts is the metaphorical indication of similarity. Nay, the word Blindness indicates losing the ability to see things. Vision is two types: vision of the sensory aspect of things, this is for the head's eye (Sight), and vision of their abstract aspect, this is for the heart's eye (Insight). Whoever loses either is blind in reality, not metaphorically.",

Lack of feeling this fire is due to the dullness of their sense, not its non-existence in them or their existence in it. Selecting Negation and Exception does not fit with stating metaphor in Fire or Eating, because metaphor has a claim, while in Restriction by this method is decisiveness and finality. The crime here is not committed except by one who reached a great extent in misguidance and severance. Whoever is among the scholars of the Revealed Divine Book then exchanges it for a worldly offer that does not weigh the wing of a mosquito with Allah Almighty, his deed is only from the burning of meanings of goodness in him, a severe burning. In this is a warning to the scholars of the Muhammadan Ummah not to conceal anything of what Allah Almighty revealed to please a person of authority or out of fear of him or looking forward to an enjoyment of the world. *** We look at another place of Al-Biqa'i's interpretation of the style of Specification in the saying of Allah Almighty: {Say, \"I am only a warner, and there is not any deity except Allah, the One, the Prevailing.} (Sad: 65). Al-Biqa'i sees that the Restriction in (I am only a warner) is a Restriction of a Described to a Description (*Qasr Mawsuf 'ala Sifah*), a Restriction of Reversal (*Qasr Qalb*). And that in (And there is not any deity except Allah, the One, the Prevailing) is a Restriction of a Description to a Described (*Qasr Sifah 'ala Mawsuf*), a Restriction of Singularity (*Qasr Ifrad*). He says: \"Since it was their custom when threatened to say: 'Hasten this for us if you are truthful in what you claimed', and it is cut (certain) that no one is capable of that except the Deity, they became as if they attributed to him that he claimed Divinity. He Almighty said alerting to that, commanding him to answer (Say) i.e., to the one who says that to you (I am only a warner) i.e., frightening to one who disobeyed. I did not claim I am a god so that might be asked of me, for no one is capable of the like of it except the Deity. So it is a Restriction of Reversal of the Described to the Description. And He singled out a restrictor of the Description in His saying (And there is not) and drowned in negation by His saying (any deity) i.e., worshiped by right, due to Him encompassing attributes of perfection.",

    "text": "And since the context was for Monotheism (Tawhid) which is the root of religion, He turned the speech from the manifestation of Greatness to One greater and clearer, so He said (Except Allah). For Encompassing, He expressed with the Proper Name gathering all Beautiful Names; if anything shared with Him, He would not be Encompassing. For Exclusivity, He said proving that (The One) i.e., in every consideration; so it is not possible that He has a part or has a like, thus being needy and equaled. (The Prevailing) i.e., who subdues others to what He wants. This is proof that He is the Deity alone, and that their deities are far from deserving divinity due to their multiplicity, equivalence by similarity, and neediness\" (1). The Context and Intent guide that the Composition in (I am only a warner) indicates restricting the Prophet (peace be upon him and his family and companions and salutations abundant) to the attribute of Warning, and removing him from the suspicion that he claims Divinity. For their habit upon which they proceeded when he frightened them with evil consequence was to attribute to him the claim of what is only from Allah Almighty, and demand him to bring them what he frightens them with. So the Holy Quranic Expression comes turning their claim of attributing him to that against them, confirming that he does not exceed being a warner causing fear as revealed to him. Designating the Attribute negated in the Restriction by *Innama* here is linked closely to the context and the stance of the addressees. It looks at the near context existing in explaining the return of the pious and the return of the tyrants, and what it included of threatening the deniers, and at the condition of the deniers when they face that threat and explanation of their destination if they persist on it. If \"Al-Biqa'i\" holds that the Negated in (I am only a warner) is the claim of Divinity, he points out shortly after that in that is also a negation of the claim that he is a liar. As if the Composition in this context gazes at the beginning of the context and its end:",

And the beginning of the context {And the disbelievers say, \"This is a magician, a liar.\"} (Sad: from verse 4) guides that the description negated in (I am only a warner) is Lying. Al-Biqa'i says afterwards: \"When He restricted his noble self to Warning, and they were disputing him in it and attributing lying to him, He indicated his truthfulness and the greatness of this news by His saying Majestic is His Majesty: {I had no knowledge of the exalted assembly [angels] when they were disputing} (Sad: 69).\" He glances in the saying of Allah Almighty (I had no knowledge...) an indication of his truthfulness in what he informs about his Lord, refuting their claim that he is a liar. And he glances in it a confirmation of the concept of Restriction in (I am only a warner) on the other face. As if the Restriction in (I am only a warner) was surrounded by what guides that he restricts himself to Warning and negates from it what some of them accuse him of claiming Divinity and ability to bring what he threatens them with, and negates from it what others accuse him of that he is a liar. So the Composition carries the indication of the negation of both descriptions with the aid of Context and surrounding clues. *** Let us look at another Compositional pattern, high in status, glorious in giving, generous: based on the positions of words in sentence construction, known among Bayan scholars as Preposing and Postposing (*Taqdim wa Ta'khir*). Standing upon the positions of words and fields of their movement in style construction is of glorious importance and at the same time of extreme difficulty. Perhaps for that reason, Abdul Qahir Al-Jurjani's attention to Preposing and Postposing and ranks of words and their orders in explaining the pillar of speech rhetoric (*Nazm*) was great. He frequently referred to Preposing, Postposing, and Arrangement. He dedicated a special chapter for Preposing in Dala'il al-I'jaz, opening it with a noble introduction in which he says:",

You continue to see poetry whose hearing pleases you and whose impact is gentle to you, then you look and find the reason it pleased you and was gentle to you is that something was preposed in it, and the wording was transferred from a place to a place\" (1). An introduction of high order and phrasing. I see it was phrased in a way by which the Imam reveals something of the status of Preposing and Postposing in the order of Expression, and at the same time tempts us to linger at that rhetorical methodology to fulfill some of its due and harvest some of its fruit. He did the like of that with the chapter of (Omission) and the chapter of (Separation and Connection), which are chapters he almost exhausted speech on in their place. Al-Biqa'i has attention to the style of Preposing, Postposing, and Arrangement. Nay, he makes Preposing, Postposing, and Arrangement in sentence construction part of what he called Compositional Order (*Nazm Tarkibi*). There is no Preposing unless there is a diversion of the thing from its place which belongs to it originally. So everything established to be preceding is not of the Preposing based on diversion for indication of a desired meaning to be expressed. Preposing particles of interrogation or negation is not said to have behind it a meaning the speaker raced to by preposing, a race requiring artifice and choice. Rather, it is preposing from the origin of the language, existing as an obligation in every tongue speaking Arabic. So there is no merit for the speaker in this preposing; rather the merit—and it is existing and established—is for the nature of the clear Arabic tongue. Similar to this is preposing the semi-sentence predicate over the indefinite subject. There is no precedence behind it that the preposer aimed for contrary to the rhetorical nature of Arabic. Rather, you see in preposing that subject then a race to an effort to indicate a meaning that would not exist except by that precedence based on diversion from what is the origin of rhetorical nature.",

    "text": "Thus, Preposing looks at the diversion of the word or the preposed item from its place which belongs to it to a preceding place. This might be accompanied by diversion from the grammatical case that belonged to it or not. While later rhetoricians' attention was directed primarily to preposing one of the two pillars of the sentence over the other, then preposing attachments over what they attach to or what what-they-attach-to is attributed to, or preposing attachments over each other, Al-Biqa'i's view extends to preposing numerous elements, whether from the sentence pillars or its restrictions or attachments. ***** The Truth Majestic is His Majesty says: {[The time of] their account has approached for the people, while they are in heedlessness turning away.} (Al-Anbiya: 1). Al-Biqa'i looks at the order of the verse, seeing a preposing of the verb's attachment (for the people) and postposing of the subject (their account). He explains to us that \"The expression came by delaying the 'Subject' and preposing the verb's attachment, because in this delay is 'Intimidation (*Tahwil*), so the soul may go every way in determining it'\" (1). This fits the objective of the Surah and what it was driven for of \"Deducing the realization of the Hour and its proximity even by death, and the occurrence of Account in it for the great and the small\" (2). As if opening with the form *Ifti'al* (Iqtaraba - Approached) instead of the simple verb (Qaruba - came near) is an indication \"to increased nearness; because there is no nation after this nation whose affair is awaited\". So it is in the breath of the Hour. Thus, expression by the form *Ifti'al* and delaying the Subject met in indicating the severity of the Hour's proximity and the severity of the terror within it.",

    "text": "And his saying \"so the soul may go every way in determining it\" contains an indication that the vastness of the signified and its variety might not be expressed by a word uttered by the tongue, but might be by diverting a word's location to another location. As if the word giving up its place which belongs to it is only for a majestic matter that forms of expression speaking by word failed to fulfill its right, so diversion from locations of words was assigned to fulfill its right. In this is a discipline for the Ummah that every position-holder who sees that in delaying himself from it or advancing [another] over him is what grants this Ummah a flood of blessing, then it is of High Manners to adopt it descending to the requirement of its condition. How many a person advanced in life's setting, conditions dictate his delay and advancing one who is below him in rank of setting. So consideration is for what conditions dictate. *** Among instances where Diversion was of glorious giving is the saying of the Truth Almighty: {And He brought down those who supported them among the People of the Scripture from their fortresses and cast terror into their hearts - [so that] a party you killed, and you took captive a party.} (Al-Ahzab: 26). What surrounds the verses depicts the terror, panic, and exemplary punishment that befell the Jews supporting the Confederates. The expression about Bani Qurayzah by the relative pronoun and its clause (those who supported them) does not hide its giving, highlighting fame by the clause and correspondence of recompense to their crime. So bringing them down from their strongholds was the sign of recompense for this treachery. Merely starting with this in the context of terror and exemplary punishment is understood as bringing down for humiliation. But \"Al-Biqa'i\" sees that \"Since bringing down from a place of immunity is a wonder, and was of various types, it was not explicit in humiliation. So the soul yearned for the clarification of its condition. He clarified that it is Humiliation, so He said conjoining with 'Waw' (And) to be fit for what is before and what is after {and cast terror into their hearts}...\" (1). He directs the conjunction with \"Waw\" that His saying {cast terror into their hearts} was fit to point to two terrors: The terror that brought them down from their fortresses...",

To this day, we have not seen even one of those heavens, and what our eyes perceive is not the heaven in its reality but a blue expanse between our vision. As for making the earth seven, this is something that human knowledge might be able to comprehend.

His command descends among them so that you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge} [At-Talaq: 12].

It will not be in the possession of Science in any of its stages until the Hour rises to view it with its tools and methods. For we, until this day of ours, have not seen a single heaven of those heavens, and what our eyes perceive is not the heaven in its reality; rather, it is a blue barrier between our eyes and the heaven.

    "text": "Likewise, the making of what is in the heavens for us, since it is not apparent to many servants unlike what is on the earth, He deleted it, and mentioned what is apparent in its matter to all servants. He folded what was not apparent to all of them to achieve complete communication of gratitude by mentioning the blessing. So He combined for us the blessing of informing us of what we have no way to know except by Revelation—which is a very high blessing not appreciated fully except by one who knows the value of the blessing of knowledge and science, and knows the danger of the calamity of ignorance and misguidance, and that knowledge is life and ignorance is death—and the blessing of gratitude that what is on earth is for us. So we must strive to invest it well for what contains a good return and destiny, and that whoever neglects the good comprehension of investing what is on earth has indeed lost a manifest loss. If we were to return with our insight to His saying, Majesty be to Him: {It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth}, and contemplate this definition of the two parties (He) (who), and its indication of exclusivity signaling Monotheism (Tawhid), and that there is no maker of that except Allah, Glory be to Him. And taste the preposing of (for you), overflowing into the hearts of the people of knowledge floods of intimacy, love, and anticipation to know the beloved's gift to them. Look how much is the longing of the lover to know what his beloved gifts him when it is indicated to him that he has a gift from him?!!! So how if the gift is from the Lord of the Worlds?!! And taste the openness of the gift in His saying (what is in the earth) and what the phrase indicates of signs of preserving it and guarding it from the hands of those who do not deserve it. And that the gift, due to its preciousness to its giver, He did not place on the surface of the earth to be touched by hands not worthy of it, but rather He placed it (in the earth). This adverbiality indicates great preservation first for the majestic hidden [treasure], and the obligation of seriousness in seeking, believing in the great value of the hidden gift.",

    "text": "And contemplate His saying (all together), which has a broad indication: It can be a circumstantial adverb (Hal) from the pronoun in (for you), meaning there is no difference between you in this except by the amount of your striving to acquire your Lord's gift to you. This is descended from the meaning of His saying (Lord of the Worlds) and His saying (The Most Merciful) at the beginning of Surah Al-Fatiha, for they are two names indicating His vast grace and that He bestows upon all His creation floods of Merciful Lordship. And it can be a circumstantial adverb from the object of (created/made), meaning He made what is in the earth all of it, not withholding any of it from any of His creation if he is worthy to receive. I see no harm in combining both aspects together. That is what became clear to me. Although he addressed the style of Ihtibak in Surah Al-Baqarah in several places, he did not explain to us the concept of Ihtibak except in Surah (Al-Imran) when interpreting the saying of Allah, Glory be to Him: {Already there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met - one fighting in the cause of Allah and another of disbelievers. They saw them [to be] twice their [own] number by [actual] eyesight. But Allah supports with His victory whom He wills. Indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision} (Al-Imran: 13). He says: \"The verse, as you see, is from the valley of Ihtibak, which is: to bring two statements from each of which something is deleted for brevity, what is mentioned indicating what is deleted from the other. In other words: it is to delete from every sentence something for brevity, and mention in the other sentence what indicates it\" (1). The dominant feature of Al-Biqa'i's methodology is that he is concerned with clarifying what was deleted and what indicated it mentioned in the statement, and he may mention the rhetorical aspect for deleting what was deleted and mentioning what was mentioned. That is like what you see in his interpretation of the compositional system in the saying of Allah, Mighty and Majestic:",

And whoever fights in the cause of Allah and is killed or achieves victory—We will grant him a great reward.”} (al-Nisāʾ: 74)\n\nHe says:\n\n“(And whoever fights in the cause of Allah) meaning: his intention is to elevate the word of the Sovereign who encompasses all qualities of beauty and majesty.\n\n(And is killed) meaning: in that path, while maintaining that intention, after divine decree and destiny take hold of him.\n\n(Or achieves victory) meaning: he overcomes the disbelievers and is saved.\n\n(We shall grant him) meaning: with a promise that has no failure…\n\nThe verse contains *iḥtibāk* (stylistic omission): mentioning *killing* first indicates safety second, and mentioning *prevailing* second indicates the possibility of being overcome first.\n\nPerhaps the use of the particle *sawfa* (shall) hints at the usually long life of the mujāhid, contrary to what many people assume—informing us that the matter belongs to the action of the All‑Wise Doer, not to outward causes.\n\n(A great reward)…\n\nHis limitation of the verse to these two states encourages steadfastness, even if the enemy is more than twice in number…\"\n\n(1) Al‑Biqāʿī points out that the Qur’anic expression mentioned *killing* in a form where the Muslim is grammatically the recipient of the action *(yuqtal – is killed)*, and mentioned *prevailing* in a form where he is the doer *(yaghlib – he overcomes)*. This illustrates the essence of Islam’s objective in jihad: the Muslim’s aim is not to slaughter the enemy nor to pursue worldly gains, but rather to seek victory for Islam and martyrdom in the path of Allah.\n\nVictory is indicated by his saying *(yaghlib – he overcomes)*, and martyrdom is indicated by *(yuqtal – is killed)*.\n\nThis obligates every mujāhid to remain firm in battle even if his enemy possesses numbers and weapons.\n\nAnd when this is the Muslim’s method, the result is nothing but honor and glory; in the honor of the Muslims lies the safety and security of the people of the world. For whenever the authority was in the hands of the Muslims in any time or place, people lived in peace and ease. ***",

    "text": "\"Ihtibak\" (reciprocal omission) and Compound Simile may intersect, such that the fabric of the simile is built upon reciprocal deletion. One of the most famous verses regarding this is the saying of Allah, Majestic is His Majesty: {The example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries cattle or sheep - deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand.} (Al-Baqarah: 171). This verse came in a context depicting the state of a group of people who take rivals besides Allah Almighty and follow the footsteps of Satan. When they are commanded to follow what Allah Almighty has revealed, they say, \"Rather, we follow that upon which we found our fathers,\" even though their fathers understood nothing, nor were they guided. So, He depicted them in an image from which every rational soul flees; He depicted them, along with those calling them to guidance, in the image of a shepherd and his sheep at which he shouts to drive them away from danger, yet they hear nothing but his voice and do not comprehend what he shouts at them. Al-Biqa'i says: \"Since the estimation was: 'Their example, then, is like one who follows a blind man on a rugged, hidden path in vast, dangerous deserts,' He conjoined to it what guides to its estimation from His saying Almighty - alerting that they have become by this like cattle, or even more astray; because even though [cattle] do not reason, they hear and see, thus finding their way to their benefits - (The example). And He explained the description that carried them to this ignorance by His saying (of those who disbelieve)... in that they do not hear from the call anything but the sound of the tone and the echo of the voice without applying their minds or having insight (is like that of one). Al-Harralli said: 'A mathal (parable) is what is obtained in the inner perception from the realities of sensory things, so it is subtler than the sensory thing. Therefore, it occurs clarifying a meaning like the intelligible meaning. The more apparent of the two serves as a parable for the more hidden. Thus, the clarification of a parable comes by a parable to refine the apparent sensory [image] and bring down the known absent [concept]. In this verse, the clarification occurs between the two parables, not between the two objects of the parable, due to the closeness of the two parables in meaning—which is the point of resemblance—and the distance between the two objects of the parable...'",

    "text": "In mentioning these two parables, there is a contrast that allows the understanding of two other parables. This necessitated two representations within a single parable. It is as if the fulfillment of the wording understood by this brevity is: 'The example of those who disbelieve and the example of their shepherd [caller], is like the example of the shepherd and the example of what he herds of cattle.' This is of the highest speech of the eloquent Arabs. Whoever does not reach the understanding of combining the two parables limits himself to interpreting it as a single parable, estimating the speech as: 'And the example of the caller of those who disbelieve (is like that of one who shouts)' i.e., yells. This is because interpretation (Ta'wil) leads to ellipsis and estimation, while understanding prevents it and necessitates understanding the Quranic delivery according to its definition and face... It is known by this that the verse is of *Ihtibak*: The likeness of the 'Caller' was deleted from the first part due to the indication of the 'Shouter' to it [in the second], and the 'Shouted at' was deleted from the second due to the indication of the 'Called ones' to it...\" (1). Interpreting the order of the verse according to this method (Reciprocal Deletion), in which he relied on \"Al-Harralli\", is the interpretation whose origin you see in the work of \"Sibawayh\" in \"Al-Kitab\" (2). This interpretation looks at the simulative representation and its composition from several elements; the context does not require mentioning all of them, but rather requires indicating some by others, folding from each side what is indicated by the mention in the other side. When we look at the first parable: 'The example of those who disbelieve', we see their representation as sheep at which their compassionate, kind shepherd shouts, driving them to their salvation, yet they hear nothing but a sound and do not understand what he shouts at them. So He mentioned what they are established in: their state of turning away from the Caller, to be evidence of what they know regarding the state of the sheep being shouted at while hearing nothing but calls and cries (And the example of those who disbelieve in their turning away from the call of the one who benefits them is like the example of sheep shouted at by their owner to save them).",

    "text": "And in the second parable: 'The example of the caller of those who disbelieve', we see his representation by the state of the shepherd of sheep in his eagerness for them and driving them away from what harms them to what benefits them. The Arabs were people of grazing who understood the state of the shepherd with his flock, his compassion for them, his eagerness for what benefits them, and his patience with them. This summons in the heart of the one among them who reasons the reality of the state of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his family and companions and abundant salutation) with them. Therefore, what was mentioned of this parable was something they could not overlook because it existed among them morning and evening. So He mentioned the shepherd of the sheep and folded the mention of the state of their shepherd and driver to their salvation (And the example of their caller to guidance is like the one who shouts...). The phrasing of the verse in this manner is something that alerts the recipient when he hears or reads that there is something in the matter, and that it cannot be at all - based on the evidence of the context accompanying numerous previous verses - a representation of the state of those who disbelieve (while it was summarized and the point of the represented was not clarified) by the state of 'the one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls', if what is meant by 'what hears not' is the sheep, indicated by 'shouts'. If it is said the meaning is: 'The example of those who disbelieve in their supplication to their idols when a need befalls them is like the one who shouts (calls) to what hears nothing but calls and cries', then this interpretation, even if its perception is close, the context indicates that His saying (deaf, dumb, blind, so they do not understand) refers to those who disbelieve, not the idols. The entire context is not a discussion about idols but a discussion about those who disbelieve and their stance on being invited to follow what Allah Almighty has revealed, claiming they follow what they found their fathers upon; so they are like sheep following the ram leading them, not understanding what they are led to. ***",

It involves manipulating pronouns that have a single referent, so it appears once as a third-person pronoun and another as a first-person pronoun, while the referent is one. However, if the pronouns vary and their referents vary with them, it is not of the *Iltifat* which is of the boldness of Arabic at all. I am not here to look into the critique among rhetoricians regarding clarifying what is shifted from (*al-multafat 'anhu*) in that style, but rather what was from \"Al-Biqa'i\" regarding this. He holds the view that what is shifted from is what the apparent context required it to be—which is known as the school of Al-Zamakhshari and Al-Sakkaki—not what the expression started with, which is known as the school of Al-Khatib and the majority. You see this in Al-Biqa'i's interpretation of the expression at the beginning of Surah 'Abasa: {He frowned and turned away * Because there came to him the blind man * But what would make you perceive, [O Muhammad], that perhaps he might be purified} (Abasa: 1-3). He says in explaining its greatest objective: \"Its objective: explaining {You are only a warner to him who fears it} (An-Nazi'at: 45), that the greatest intent is purifying the one capable of fear by warning of the Resurrection...\" Then he proceeds to interpret the opening of the Surah's recitation, saying:..",

    "text": "In this method of addressing the Prophet (peace be upon him and his family and companions and abundant salutation) is an elevation of his status firstly, and a clarification of his rank with his Lord Almighty secondly, and a teaching to his Ummah on how their address should be with their Prophet (peace be upon him...). It is also a clarification that his action (peace be upon him) was merely out of consideration for the welfare of the whole Ummah, prioritizing the benefit of the Ummah over the benefit of one individual within it. For if those leaders, or some of them, entered Islam, their entry would be a benefit to the Ummah on one hand, and to Abdullah bin Umm Maktum himself (may Allah be pleased with him) secondly, in that he would be safe from their harm. Al-Biqa'i indicated the symmetry of the *Iltifat* (shift) from the direct address required by the apparent situation to the third person, then from the third person to the direct address. Along with that is the *Iltifat* from the simple verb form in (*'abasa* - he frowned) to the derived form (*tafa''ul*) in (*tawalla* - he turned away/took it upon himself to turn). All of that stands to clarify the great status of the Prophet (peace be upon him...). It is not hidden that the shift from the simple form in the verb (*'abasa*) to the increased form (*taf'il*) in (*tawalla*) is not of the terminological *Iltifat* according to later rhetoricians, but it is from the chapter of shifting from one thing to another for a meaning and a requirement. *** Among the Compositional Order known to the Badi' scholars is *Laff wa Nashr* (Involution and Evolution / Folding and Spreading).

They were touched by poverty and hardship (*al-ba'sa' wa al-darra'*) and were shaken until the messenger and those who believed with him said, \"When is the help of Allah?\" Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near. * They ask you what they should spend.

    "text": "\"Since spending is one of the fundamentals upon which the Surah was built regarding the attributes of believers {and out of what We have provided for them they spend}, then encouragement for it was repeated within the folds of the verses until it was commanded in the beginning of the verses of Hajj mentioned recently [v: 195-197], alongside being the pillars of the beginnings of Jihad until the preceding verse contained it [v: 214] along with killing which is the ultimate Jihad, this was the place for asking about both. So He Almighty informed about that by way of Disordered (Reversed) Spreading (*Nashr Mushawwash*), and that supports what I understood regarding *Al-Ba'sa'* and *Al-Darra'*, for its usage [i.e., the disordered] in the Quran is more frequent than the ordered. So He said, teaching the one who asked: Did the addressees ask about both of them with that? (They ask you what... they should spend...\" (1). Al-Biqa'i holds that *Al-Ba'sa'* is used more for war and *Al-Darra'* is used more for wealth. This is an indication from him to the statistical interpretative method which gathers evidences of the rhetorical phenomenon in the entire pondered discourse so the contemplator stands upon what is dominant in the discourse regarding its rhetorical sunnah (norm), to adopt that as his methodology in interpretation based on what is dominant in that expression. If you look at the signification of the material of *Al-Ba'sa'* in the Quranic expression, you find it for what afflicts the body (An-Nisa: 84, An-Nahl: 81, Al-Isra: 5, Al-Anbiya: 80, An-Naml: 23, Al-Hadid: 25). And if you look at the material of *Al-Darra'*, you find it for what afflicts wealth (Al-Baqarah: 233, Al-Imran: 134, Yusuf: 88, At-Talaq: 6). So what Al-Biqa'i went to is higher and more fitting to the Quranic expression. And if you look at the context of the verses in which Al-Biqa'i claimed Disordered Spreading, you find that Surah \"Al-Baqarah\" abounds in talk about spending, making it a fundamental attribute of the Muttaqin (pious). Affliction in wealth preceded affliction in self in the Surah (v: 155), and it spoke about spending (v: 177, 261, 262, 265, 274).",

Since the context was for spending, He prioritized it over fighting, saying first (They ask you what they should spend) then saying (Fighting has been enjoined upon you). Thus, it was a disordered (reversed) Folding and Spreading. Al-Biqa'i did not point to the reason for the expression using this Compositional approach in this verse. Perhaps it is because when Allah Almighty said in the beginning of the Surah (Guidance for the righteous * Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and out of what We have provided for them, they spend) (Al-Baqarah: 2-3), and since the statement about Islam's stance on wealth has such a significant status in the Surah, it was of care to make the statement about it in the middle of the meaning. It is as if there is an indication that Jihad with wealth is the pillar of Jihad with the sword, and that victory of the religion is not by the sword alone but by other matters wherein wealth is primary. *** Looking into the interpretation of Compositional Order in the construction of the sentence or verse in Al-Biqa'i's Tafsir cannot be fulfilled in all its aspects in this space.

The universal objectives of the Holy Quran are not expressed in a single place in the Holy Quran; rather, you see Him varying the expression about them in numerous places and diversifying the ways of indicating them, a diversification that penetrating and vast contemplation can hardly encompass. Al-Biqa'i says in interpreting the saying of Allah Almighty: (*Mutashabihan Mathaniya*): \"(Mutashabihan/Consistent) meaning in miraculous eloquence and good admonition; there is no disparity in it at all in wording or meaning, despite it being revealed disjointedly over twenty-some years... He did not say 'Mushtabihan' (ambiguous/confusing) lest it be thought that it is all unclear in indication, for that is not praise. Since it is detailed into Surahs, verses, and sentences, He described it with the plural in His saying (*Mathaniya*), plural of *Mathna* from *Tathniya* meaning repetition. Meaning: stories, admonitions, rulings, and wisdoms are repeated/doubled in it, differing in expression in aspects of wisdom, varying in methods in clarity of indications, without any difference at all in the original meaning. One does not tire of its repetition, nor of repeating its reading, contemplation, and consideration. Additionally, everything in it is pairs of a thing and its opposite... No reward is arranged for anything therein except that it is doubled (followed) by understanding what is for its opposite by allusion, so it is mentioned twice, and encouraged or warned against twice... The benefit of repetition is that souls are most averse to the talk of preaching and advice. Unless it is repeated to them, returning to the beginning, it does not become firmly established with them, nor does it do its work. Hence, the Prophet (peace be upon him and his family and companions and abundant salutation) used to repeat his saying three times or more...\" (1).

    "text": "Rhetorical Derivation/Variation (*Tasrif Bayani*) for the fundamentals of meanings of Guidance in the Holy Quran. These two principles are present in the Quranic Expression, a presence whose dazzling, conquering evidences do not disappear or cloud over. The second principle (Rhetorical Derivation) has received some of its due from many scholars, and books have been written on it. It has been known among scholars as \"Mutashabih al-Nazm\" (Similarities in Order). The truth is that \"Rhetorical Derivation\" to me is wider in scope than \"Mutashabih al-Nazm\": I hold that \"Mutashabih al-Nazm\" should be a term for what is similar in expression regarding its order-based relationships such as preposing, postposing, separation, connection, mention, and deletion in the construction of the sentence, verse, node (Ma'qid), or Surah. Meaning, the similarity whose pivot is the Order features which are grammatical relationships between meanings of words in sentence construction (Grammatical/Compositional Order), and that whose pivot is the Order features which are contextual relationships between meanings of sentences in verse construction, or between meanings of verses in node construction, or meanings of nodes in Surah construction... (Contextual/Arrangement Order). And \"Rhetorical Derivation\" includes this joined with the similarity whose source is choosing one word in place of another (exploded/gushed), (decreed/wrote), (swore/oath), (feared/dreaded), (year/season), (spouse/woman), (sent down/revealed), (saved/delivered)... etc., which is known among scholars as Derivation (*Tasrif*) in choosing words and their forms. Al-Biqa'i has extreme, eloquent care for contemplating this type of Rhetorical Derivation (*Mutashabih al-Nazm*), adhering to the method of looking into what the Context and Intent require. In this, he is worthy of having a special study dedicated to him, and balancing his method in this with the method of \"Abu Ja'far bin Al-Zubayr\" in (*Milak al-Ta'wil*), or \"Al-Kirmani\" in (*Al-Burhan*), or \"Al-Iskafi\" in (*Durrat al-Tanzil*). From this chapter is what came from Al-Biqa'i in interpreting the saying of Allah Almighty: {Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.} (Al-Baqarah: 7) and the saying of Allah Almighty:..",

    "text": "{Have you seen he who has taken as his god his [own] desire, and Allah has sent him astray due to knowledge and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil? So who will guide him after Allah? Then will you not be reminded?} (Al-Jathiyah: 23). He says regarding the verse of Al-Baqarah: \"Since He equated warning them with the lack thereof, starting with hearts was more appropriate to equate them with cattle. Since the stupid person might hear or see, thus finding guidance, and [the need] for hearing is more harmful due to its generality, while vision is specific to conditions of light, He negated hearing then vision to lower them below the state of cattle. Contrary to what is in 'Al-Jathiyah', for when He informed therein of misguidance, and the misguided one is most in need of hearing the Guide, He negated it. And since the deaf one might possess understanding or sight, making his guidance possible, and understanding was more noble, He negated them in that order\" (1). And he says in interpreting the verse of 'Al-Jathiyah': \"Since the misguided is in greater need of hearing the Guide's voice than anything else, and one who does not benefit from what he has is judged as lacking it, He said: (And has set a seal) i.e., in addition to the present misguidance (upon his hearing) so he has no understanding of the heard verses. And since the deaf might understand by gesture, He said (and his heart) i.e., so he does not retain what is rightful to retain. And since the deaf insane person might see his harms and benefits, engaging them like cattle, He said (and put over his vision a veil) so he became unable to see the visible signs. Its order is thus; because it is in the context of misguidance as preceded in 'Al-Baqarah'.\" (2). It is clear that Al-Biqa'i did not stop in interpreting the similar order in the two verses except at the similarity in the arrangement between the heart, hearing, and sight, as He prioritized hearing over the heart in Al-Jathiyah after prioritizing the heart [in Al-Baqarah].",

    "text": "He did not stop at the repetition of the preposition in Al-Baqarah with hearing and heart (*'ala* qulubihim wa *'ala* sam'ihim) and leaving it in \"Al-Jathiyah\" (*'ala* sam'ihi wa qalbihi). Nor did he stop at bringing the nominal sentence in \"Al-Baqarah\" (wa *'ala* absarihim ghishawatun) with the nominative case, and the verbal sentence in \"Al-Jathiyah\" (wa *ja'ala* 'ala basarihi ghishawatan). From this is what you see of his clarification to us of the facet of expression in the saying of Allah Almighty in Surah Al-Baqarah: {And We said, \"O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.\"} (Al-Baqarah: 35) and His saying Almighty in Surah \"Al-A'raf\": {And \"O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat from wherever you will but do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.\"} (Al-A'raf: 19). The story of our father \"Adam\", peace be upon him, came in several Surahs, but the command to eat from Paradise wherever they willed did not come except in two Surahs: Al-Baqarah and Al-A'raf. In Surah \"Al-Baqarah\": The expression came conjoined with 'Waw' (And), and in Al-A'raf with 'Fa' (Then). In Al-Baqarah, the expression came saying (therefrom), and in Al-A'raf (from wherever you will). In Al-Baqarah, His saying (plentifully/raghadan) came driving His saying (wherever you will), and that did not come in Al-A'raf, despite the Divine Expression regarding their command being about one thing. So for which of them was the Divine Expression commanding them? If we come to the similar order in this sentence depicting the Divine Command to Adam (peace be upon him) and his wife to eat from Paradise, we find that when the context therein was \"merely to explain the blessings as an appeal for familiarity, conjoining eating with 'Waw' in His saying Majestic is His Majesty (And eat therefrom) was sufficient for that. Explicitly mentioning 'Raghad' (plenty/ease), which is the greatest of blessings, had a great position, so He Almighty said (plentifully)... (wherever... you will)..",

    "text": "Unlike the context of Al-A'raf, for it was intended therein, along with reminding of blessings, to define the increase in empowerment (*Tamkin*), and that it did not prevent expulsion, as a warning to those established in the earth, expanded in livelihoods, against the descending of punishments...\" (1). In Surah \"Al-A'raf\" he says: \"Since the context here is for defining that He empowered our father, peace be upon him, in Paradise greater than His empowering us in the earth by bestowing upon him therein the abundance of life accompanying his existence, then it was good in His saying (So eat) to conjoin with 'Fa' (Then) indicating that the eaten thing was with the dwelling, not delayed from it. There is no contradiction between it and expressing with 'Waw' in 'Al-Baqarah'; because the concept of 'Fa' is a type included under the concept of 'Waw', and there is no contradiction between Type and Genus. And His saying (from wherever you will) means 'plentifully', i.e., widely, for it indicates the permissibility of eating from everything in it except what is forbidden. As for the verse of Al-Baqarah, it indicates the permissibility of eating from it in any place. This context to its end indicates that whoever disobeys His command Almighty, his throne is demolished and his glory destroyed, even if he has the utmost ability and end of strength, just as He expelled the one for whom He maximized ability by making His angels prostrate, dwelling him in His Paradise, and permitting everything therein except one tree...\" (2). *** Among the similar order that Al-Biqa'i lingers at is what came of delaying (Purification/*Tazkiyah*) after Teaching in the supplication of the Father of Prophets Abraham, peace be upon him, and presenting it before it in others. Allah Almighty said: {Our Lord, and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise.} (Al-Baqarah: 129)",

    "text": "{Certainly did Allah confer [great] favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom, although they had been before in manifest error.} (Al-Imran: 164) {It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom - although they were before in clear error.} (Al-Jumu'ah: 2). These are three verses; Purification (*Tazkiyah*) was presented over Teaching in the first of them, and Teaching was presented over Purification in the other two. What is the facet of expression in that? Al-Biqa'i looks, in interpreting the systemic similarity of preposing and postposing, at the meaning of the preposed word, the context in which it appeared, and who the speech was about. He looked and saw that the verse of Surah \"Al-Baqarah\", narrating the supplication of the Father of Prophets: Abraham peace be upon him, is regarding the supplication for the Muslim Ummah (my descendants), and it is not such unless it has acquired Purification from Polytheism (*Shirk*) by the origin of Islam characterizing it. So the Purification required here is not purification from Shirk, but rather a purification founded upon prior knowledge of the Book and Wisdom, i.e., it is a purification of ascending in stations of obedience and proximity. And the Purification in Surah Al-Jumu'ah is purification from Shirk by which the origin of Faith is established; because the context is to talk about the Unlettered (*Al-Ummiyyin*), the Nation of Invitation (*Ummah al-Da'wah*), who have Shirk within them. So it is as if the Purification here is not the one requested by our master Abraham peace be upon him for his people in the verse of Surah \"Al-Baqarah\". Purification here needs to precede teaching the Book and Wisdom, because teaching them does not bear fruit for one whose heart is not purified from Shirk. Hence, Purification from Shirk was presented over teaching the Book and Wisdom...",

So the requirement of the apparent was to delay Purification after Teaching as was in the supplication of our master Abraham peace be upon him. But Al-Biqa'i notices an important matter, which is that the verse of \"Al-Imran\" came in the context of admonishing the Believers regarding the spoils of war on the Day of Uhud. This was a grave matter from them; they were in need of purification from it first, then the teaching of the Book and Wisdom comes as an elevation for them and a cleansing from what does not befit them, even if they were purified from Shirk. The difference in the signification of Purification and who the speech was about is what necessitated the preposing and postposing. \"Al-Biqa'i\" says regarding the verse of \"Al-Baqarah\": \"When he requested what belongs to him in the office of Prophethood—Allah Almighty teaching him the rituals without an intermediary—he requested the like of that for his descendants through the intermediary of one whom custom established for their likes. So he said (Our Lord, and send among them) i.e., the Muslim Ummah which is from my descendants and the descendants of my son Ishmael (a messenger from themselves)... and that Messenger is Muhammad, peace be upon him and his family and companions and abundant salutation, for no one else was sent from their descendants with the Book...

Since the appearance of his call, peace be upon him, was that the Sending in the Muslim Ummah meant they were in greater need of teaching what was mentioned than of Purification—for its origin exists through Islam—he delayed his saying (and purify them) i.e., cleanse their hearts with what he was given of precise wisdom, so they ascend by its purity and subtlety from the peak of Religion to a place where they are safe from turning back on their heels and distorting their Book as those before them did...

What I have pointed to guides to that feature among the features of \"Al-Biqa'i's\" methodology in interpreting the Wise Quranic Expression. The Eleventh Feature. Rhetorical Direction of Quranic Readings (*Qira'at*). It was from the grace of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, upon His servants that He did not reveal His Book in a single mode of recitation from which meanings of guidance are deduced; rather, the Revelation came in several modes, as the Purified Sunnah guided to: \"This Quran was revealed in seven letters (modes), so read what is easy of it\" (The Two Sheikhs: Al-Bukhari, Book: Virtues of the Quran, and \"Muslim\", Book: The Travelers - and the text belongs to him, Hadith No. 270/818). In the same chapter, Muslim narrated from Ubayy bin Ka'b that the Prophet, peace be upon him and his family and companions and abundant salutation, was at the pool of Bani Ghifar. He said: Gabriel peace be upon him came to him and said \"...Indeed Allah commands you that your Ummah read the Quran on seven letters; whichever letter they read upon, they have done right\" (Hadith: 274/821). In the multiplicity of these readings is a flood of mercy of alleviation for this Ummah. It is an alleviation not limited to performance and recitation, though this is the most apparent, but it is an alleviation in the assignment (*Taklif*) arising from the meanings of guidance deduced from those readings. Whoever reads with a letter and deduces from it meanings of guidance—a correct deduction according to the scientific principles of deduction—has done right. All of it is sufficient and healing, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.",

    "text": "The multiplicity of forms of performance is not a sterile multiplicity regarding the objectives for which the Quran was revealed: informing servants of the meanings of guidance desired by the Truth Almighty. Rather, every form of the Mutawatir (consecutive) performance possesses a giving from types of these abundant meanings which do not wear out with much repetition. Hence, listening to the Holy Quran was an act of worship {So when the Qur'an is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy.} (Al-A'raf 204). He conditioned the realization of mercy on two conditions: Listening (*Istima'*) and Silence (*Insat*) together. Listening by casting the hearing and striving not to be distracted by a distraction, as alluded to by the form *Ifti'al* (Istami'u); and Silence (*Insat*), which is leaving speech entirely so that there is not in the slightest forms of speech what distracts from receiving the subtle meanings in listening to it, which one might not be able to perceive if occupied by a distraction of speech even if he listened along with it. If the forms of performance are *Tawqifi* (divinely ordained), then in every form established in its place and context is what makes it proportionate, interwoven, brotherly, and harmonious with the context in which it was established. This is what makes readings multiply in the performance of a Quranic word in a context, while the same word in another context has only one reading. This indicates that Context and Intent have a strong relationship with the multiplicity or unity of forms of performance. This is what urged me to look into Al-Biqa'i's interpretation of such faces. ***** Among the forms of performance are Idgham (merging) and Fak (separation) of a certain word among the words of the Glorious Quran. Idgham has an apparent phonetic face in entering the sound of a letter into the sound of another letter, and Fak is its opposite. It is strange that in the form and performance of the word \"Fak\" itself is Idgham [the double Kaf]. This paradox is like an allusion that even if Fak is the origin, consideration of what phonetic proportionality requires in this is a great basis of the bases of Holy Quranic proportionality...",

    "text": "Scholars of Arabic rhetoric had majestic attention to phonetic proportionality in their rhetorical books, especially the later ones who made that phonetic proportionality the introduction to the eloquence of discourse which is the basis of its rhetoric. This phonetic face: Idgham and Fak has a semantic face in the Quranic expression; Al-Biqa'i contemplates some of its images. The word (*yartadda*) came in Surah Al-Baqarah and in Surah Al-Ma'idah. The Almighty said in Surah \"Al-Baqarah\": {They ask you about the sacred month - about fighting therein. Say, \"Fighting therein is great [sin], but averting [people] from the way of Allah and disbelief in Him and [preventing access to] al-Masjid al-Haram and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater [evil] in the sight of Allah. And fitnah is greater than killing.\" And they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able. And whoever of you reverts (*yartadid*) from his religion [to disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire, they will abide therein eternally.} (Al-Baqarah: 217). And in Surah \"Al-Ma'idah\": {O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert (*yartadda*) from his religion - Allah will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic. That is the favor of Allah; He bestows it upon whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.} (Al-Ma'idah: 54). In Surah Al-Baqarah (v: 217), the narrators agreed on reading with the separation of Idgham in it (*yartadid*). They did not agree on that in Surah Al-Ma'idah (v: 54). In Al-Ma'idah, \"Nafi', Abu Ja'far, and Ibn Amir read (*man yartadid*) with separation of Idgham, and the rest of the Ten read (*yartadda*) with one stressed Dal\" (1).",

Hence, it was incumbent to look into the requirement of the multiplicity of the performance form in Al-Ma'idah and its unity in Surah Al-Baqarah. Al-Biqa'i says in contemplating the verse of Al-Baqarah: \"The consensus of the Reciters on Separation (*Fak*) here is to indicate that the nullification [of deeds] is conditioned upon disbelief outwardly by the tongue and inwardly by the heart. So it alludes to forgiveness for the pronunciation of the tongue while the heart is at rest [with faith]. The reading of Idgham in (Al-Ma'idah) indicated that patience is a higher degree than responding with the tongue even if the heart is at rest\" (1). And he says regarding Surah Al-Ma'idah: \"When He forbade taking them as allies and informed that the doer of such is one of them, He negated the metaphor, declaring the intent explicitly. So He said, manifesting the result of what preceded (O you who have believed) i.e., acknowledged faith, whoever allies with them among you - this was the original [meaning], but He stated explicitly that this is leaving the religion, so He said (*man yartadda*), even if in a hidden way as indicated by Idgham in the reading of those other than the Medinans and Ibn Amir (*minkum 'an dinihi*)...\" (2). The verse of Al-Baqarah is in the context of judging the nullification of the work of the apostate from Islam in the world and the Hereafter. This does not happen except to one who apostatizes outwardly by tongue and inwardly by heart. The verse stated explicitly the internal apostasy by the heart in His saying: (and dies while he is a disbeliever). So the external apostasy remained; the Performance was the indicator of it. So Separation (*Fak*) is necessary here because in Separation is Manifestation (*Izhar*), which is a linguistic/tongue action, alluding to the precise proportionality in the indication. So the verse combined the two conditions of nullifying deeds by apostasy: Apostasy outwardly indicated here by separation of Idgham, and Apostasy inwardly indicated by the phrase (and dies while he is a disbeliever). It is strange that internal apostasy was indicated by the phrase, and external apostasy was indicated by the performance of the phrase (Separation of Idgham).",

    "text": "In conditioning internal apostasy for the nullification of deeds and indicating it by way of the phrase is an opening of the door of pardon for one who is compelled while his heart is content with faith; he is one compelled to external apostasy without combining it with internal apostasy. As for the verse of (Al-Ma'idah), it was in the context of prohibiting taking Jews and Christians as allies (Verse: 51) and lack of patience in tribulation (Verse: 52). So Verse (54) came indicating that Allah Almighty might punish for internal apostasy indicated by the narration of (Idgham) and external apostasy indicated by the narration of (Izhar/Separation) by bringing a people He loves and who love Him. In this is a great threat that tears out the hearts of those who understand. Had the narration come with a single mode of performance, this would have been a deficiency in the conditions of punishment: realizing apostasy by one of two ways. Punishment is not dependent on the gathering of both conditions together at one time; rather, realizing one of them might result in punishment: Bringing a people He loves and who love Him. There is another indication: Idgham here points out that patience, which the one discussed in Verse (52) did not strive for, is indeed a higher degree than external apostasy by the tongue. We must note the difference between the answer to the condition in (Al-Baqarah) and its answer in (Al-Ma'idah): In (Al-Baqarah) it is nullification of deeds, and that is a destructive killer. In (Al-Ma'idah) it is replacement and substituting a people in place of a people; although it is great to the people of Gnosis, it is less than nullification of deeds. So the indicator of the condition of the answer to the condition in (Al-Ma'idah) was by way of Performance, which is an indication containing some concealment not understood by many people. And the indicator of the main condition for realizing the answer [in Al-Baqarah] was by way of the explicit phrase. This contains types of proportionality. This was \"Al-Biqa'i\". Look in his company at what his Sheikh \"Ibn al-Jazari\" said in Al-Nashr justifying the separation of Idgham by agreement in Al-Baqarah with his saying:..",

    "text": "\"Because the length of Al-Baqarah necessitates verbosity (*Itnab*) and increasing the letter is part of that. Do you not see His saying Almighty (*wa man yushaqiqi Allaha wa rasulahu*) in Al-Anfal (v: 13) how separation of its Idgham was agreed upon, and His saying (*wa man yushaqq Allaha*) in (Al-Hashr: 4) how its Idgham was agreed upon? That is due to the closeness of the two stations to Verbosity and Brevity\" (1). What \"Ibn al-Jazari\" said, if it stood, would imply that everything in Al-Baqarah must be on the method of expansion, and that there should be no brevity by deletion of a word or brevity of restriction in it. How can \"Ibn al-Jazari\" justify a rhetorical approach with a rhetorical approach that itself is in need of justification like it? Length of statement is not a requirement by which a rhetorical face is directed; rather, the requirement comes from the very meanings and objectives to which the Surah is driven, and the conditions surrounding the Revelation. ***** Among what the narration agreed on performing in one way in a Surah and differed on in another Surah is the verb (yara/tara - see) in the saying of Allah Almighty: {Do they not see (*alam yaraw*) the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky? None holds them except Allah. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.} (An-Nahl: 79) {Do they not see (*awalam yaraw*) the birds above them with wings outspread and [sometimes] folded in? None holds them except the Most Merciful. Indeed He is, of all things, Seeing.} (Al-Mulk: 19). They differed in reading (*yaraw*) in (An-Nahl) with the third person and the second person, and agreed on the third person in Al-Mulk: \"Abu Ja'far, Nafi', Ibn Kathir, Abu Amr, Asim, and Al-Kisa'i read (*alam yaraw*) with Ya [they], and Ibn Amir, Hamza, Ya'qub, and Khalaf read (*alam taraw*) with Ta [you]\" (2). Al-Biqa'i holds regarding the verse of An-Nahl that \"The speech and its context admit the Acceptor and the Turner-away, unlike the context of Al-Mulk, for it is for the Turner-away (Adversary). Thus, the reciters differed here and agreed there\" (3).",

    "text": "He said regarding Surah Al-Mulk: \"The reciters agreed on reading here in the third person; because the context is for refuting the deniers, unlike what is in An-Nahl\" (1). If we look at the context of the verse of An-Nahl, we see it came in the exposition of enumerating blessings as evidence and gratitude. Gratitude, at least, is for the Acceptor and the Turner-away, and verses (70-72, 78, 80-81) confirm this. Whoever read with the second person (address) noted the side of the Acceptor; because blessings were created in reality for him (Al-A'raf: 32), so he is prioritized for that. Let the performance of the verse observe that in some aspects. And whoever read with the third person noted the side of providing evidence which is primarily for the Turner-away so he may be convinced from this aspect; thus the third-person reading observed it. The context of the verse of An-Nahl, as you see, accommodates both faces together, the Acceptor and the Turner-away, so there were two narrations. The context of (Al-Mulk) is for exposition only and refuting the deniers (Verses: 15 and following), so it is a context that does not admit directing the address [to believers] in this verse. Also, because it did not come to threaten the Turner-aways like its predecessor and successor, but to explain that He who causes the earth to swallow the tyrants by the authority of Subjugation possesses the power to hold the weak bird by the flood of His Mercy so it does not fall. Hence, the expression in the verse of Al-Mulk was His saying (except the Most Merciful), while in the verse of An-Nahl (None holds them except Allah). **** We look at another verse in which Al-Biqa'i borrowed the interpretation of the performance form from Al-Harralli but did not add anything to it, although he had the ability to do so, which shows us an aspect of his methodology in this. The Almighty said: {And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease. But if you give [from your right as] charity, then it is better for you, if you only knew.} (Al-Baqarah: 280). In His saying (*'usrah*) there are two readings (with Damma on Sin and with Sukun). And in (*maysarah*) there is a reading with Damma on Sin, a reading with Fatha, and a reading with Damma on Sin and Kasra on Ha causing saturation (Ishba'). \"Ibn Mahran\" says: \"Abu Ja'far alone read (*wa in kana dhu 'usurah*) with Damma on Sin, and the rest read (*'usrah*) with Sukun on Sin.",

And the rest read (*ila maysarah*) with Fatha on Sin\" (1). In the verse are modes of performance, and every mode has a flood of meaning proportionate to the extended context and the vast intent that gathers the Ummah, granting every degree a portion of its giving. Al-Biqa'i says, quoting from \"Al-Harralli\": \"Since people are divided into solvent and insolvent, i.e., rich and poor, it was as if said: This is the ruling of the solvent. (And if there is) i.e., found among the debtors (one of hardship) unable to pay at this time (then a look/respite) i.e., upon you is a respite for him. 'Al-Harralli' said: It is the delay anticipating accomplishment (until ease) if you are not satisfied except with taking your wealth. Nafi' and Hamza read with Damma on Sin. 'Al-Harralli' said: An indication of the dominance of ease, which is the wider of the two respites. The rest with Fatha is an indication of its intermediacy, so ease is in two ranks. Whoever waits until the widest of the two eases, it was a better repentance. End quote\" (2). Al-Biqa'i looked, following Al-Harralli, at the signification of the Damma of Sin in (*maysurah*), sensing from its strong sound an indication of the complete ease of the insolvent, thus being a call that his respite be until his ease is complete. And he looked at the signification of the Fatha of Sin in it, sensing from its sound an indication of the intermediacy of ease, since Fatha is weaker than Damma. In the conditions of the word's vowel sound is an indication of the conditions of the meaning itself and its relation to the one the statement belongs to. Either of the two respites for the insolvent is obedience, except that the lower of them is a necessary right upon every Muslim, and the higher of them is a virtue upheld by the people of Ihsan (Excellence). Whoever is towards the higher indicated by Damma, it was a better repentance from what came from him of lending with interest which is the very detested, obliterated Riba. So the reading of Fatha is for the people of the first ages of Faith (Those who believe), and the reading of Damma is for those above them in ages of Faith: The Believers... The Doers of Good (Muhsinin).",

    "text": "Diversity of meanings through diversity of readings fulfills the stations and ranks of obedience. For the people of obedience are not equal in their stations within it. Some readings depict an Ihsani (Excellence-based) meaning transcending what another reading depicts of the general meanings which are guidance for mankind and those who believe. All are sufficient and healing for every possessor of a station and rank of the ascending ranks of proximity. In the verse are modes of performance in (*'usrah*) with Damma on Sin and with its Sukun. Behind every mode is a meaning existing in the context towards the intent aimed at by the noble verse. It was sensed in the reading of Damma on Sin of (*'usurah*) an observation of the state of one whose hardship is severe; his right is inevitably to be given respite according to the amount of his hardship. If it ceases, the creditor has the right to demand from him. And in the Sukun of Sin of (*'usrah*) is an observation of the state of one whose hardship is light; his right is to be given respite also according to it, and not be deprived of respite. Had the narration come with Damma on Sin alone, there would be in this a deprivation of the one whose hardship is slight from the mercy of respite. In giving respite to the one of slight hardship is education and training on adopting the character of mercy, benevolence, and grace. In His saying (*nazirah/respite*) are modes of performance, some of which are not from the Ten Readings: The majority read (*fanaziratun*) with Kasra on (*Za*), being a predicate of an omitted subject, i.e., the obligation is a respite. Al-Hasan, Mujahid, and Al-Dahhak read (*fanazratun*) with Sukun on (*Za*), which is a lightening of (*nazirah*), following a dialect in Tamim: they say in *kalimah*: *kalmah*. It is as if in this verse is a lightening for the owner of wealth from one aspect and an encouragement for him to give respite from another, and a suggestion to him that respite is indeed light, so let him not calculate that calling to it is a burden upon him. The reading of Kasra on (*Za*) has an allusion that the respite should be complete, strong, encompassing the state of the insolvent, and that the owner of wealth be enabled to fulfill this duty: Respite. In this is education on excellence, mastery, and relieving those of need and hardship..",

    "text": "In the Sukun of the *Za* is a meaning of permissibility that the respite be according to the insolvency without excess, and an allusion that its realization is not difficult for the owner of wealth. It is a reading looking at the state of the wealth owner from two aspects: an aspect that is his right, and an aspect containing benefit for him through education, enticement, and incitement not to find the respite heavy, for it is light even if its duration is long. So the people of high aspirations perceive in the Sukun of *Za* an enticement for them to endure and a depiction to them that this is not difficult for them, rather it is light in reality due to the lightening of the sound of the middle of the word. (That is best and most suitable for final determination) (An-Nisa: 59). And the people of lower aspiration look at the fact that in Sukun is an indication of their right that the respite does not have to reach the complete perfection of the removal of insolvency. Everyone reads in the mode of performance what suits him (And follow the best of what was revealed to you from your Lord) (Az-Zumar: 55). In the word is another reading: Ata' bin Abi Rabah read (*fanaziruhu*) with Alif: Active Participle (Subject Noun), and the Ha is a pronoun annexed to the Active Participle, i.e., whoever gives respite to the debtor is towards ease. In this reading is an indication of glad tidings that whoever gives respite to the insolvent debtor, his state and all his affair, because of his respite to him, will be towards ease. In this is a response to what the Prophetic statement brought: \"...And whoever relieves a Muslim, Allah will relieve him of a distress from the distresses of the Day of Resurrection\" (Agreed upon: Al-Bukhari: Al-Mazalim, and Muslim: Al-Birr). And a fourth reading in it: Ata' also read (*fanazirhu*) with Sukun on Ra on the basis that it is an Imperative Verb meaning: treat him with ease and forgive him until the time of respite. It is from *Munazarah* meaning forgiveness and closeness (*Mudanah*), not from *Munazarah* meaning argumentation and debate..",

    "text": "Thus it becomes clear to you that there are modes of performance in the verse, and that in these modes is proportionality with the context. For the verse is established to call the Muslim to be in the aid of his brother, and that his lending to him should not be for the sake of benefiting from what he takes from him, but benefiting from what he earns of Allah Almighty's reward, then from what he realizes for the Ummah of the feeling of harmony and mutual support. This, if spread in a nation, purifies it from many of the diseases that exhaust its powers, tear its structure, and throw it into the humiliation of division, fighting, negligence, and distraction from caring for the conditions of brothers. That is the disease from which the Ummah is attacked. ***** Indeed, every element of expression, especially the Quranic expression, has a profound, glorious effect on constructing the meaning, depicting it, and embellishing it. The features of that effect might be hidden from us, but this is not valid to be a cause for denying its existence. If one were to deny everything not seen, the matter would be very dangerous. The head of Faith in Islam is Belief in the Unseen. So one must stop at what he knows without denying the existence of what he does not know. *** Standing upon what came in these verses of readings is from the chapter of beneficial knowledge. Arabic study celebrates the like of this.

This feature of his methodology in interpreting the rhetoric of the Holy Quran is a vast feature; a single research cannot encompass the abundance of what came from him regarding it. The material of the word is the original letters from which the word is formed and in which it shares with its peers and sisters. These original letters carry in themselves and in the method of their arrangement what they indicate of a meaning. Scholars of Arabic have extreme care for this. Linguistic theories in this field are extensive, deep, possessing subtleties and niceties. \"Ibn Jinni\", \"Ibn Faris\", and others had a merit in this field that does not hide. What is meant by the signification of the material is what the word inherits from its origins that formed it. It carries this inheritance with it in its locations, mixing some of the significations it acquires from other tributaries with it, like the significations of its form or the significations of its performance. The word in Arabic expression is like the individual in the human world; it carries from the origins of its lineage and germ a flood of traits and characteristics it does not abandon as long as life remains in its bond or it remains in its bond. Then its actions vary, and what it grants and prevents, and what it shows and hides, according to what it aims for and intends, and what it stands in or is established. So it is eloquent in its action, descending upon the requirement of its conditions and the contexts of its existence in their variety and multiplicity. Like it is the word in Arabic expression; eloquent by what it descends upon of requirements of conditions in their variety and multiplicity, and contexts in their extension, distance, and nearness. The world of Expression in the Arabic tongue is from the world of Man in the Arabian Peninsula when it was Arab.

So repent to your Maker (*Bari'ikum*), and kill yourselves.

Since the context here, after what came in Surah (Al-Asr), is a context of educating the soul prone to evil with great intimidation from those deeds crushing the structure of the Ummah and turning away from what saves it from loss—through good faith, righteous deeds, advising truth, and advising patience—\"Al-Biqa'i\" reveals the proportionality between the signification of the material of this verb and this name and their contexts, saying: \"...(*la-yunbadhanna*): i.e., he will surely be thrown after his death, the throwing of what is light, very despicable to every thrower, as indicated by the expression with *Nabdh*, and in the passive voice (into *Al-Hutamah*) i.e., the layer of Fire whose nature is to crush (*tah-tim*), i.e., break and smash with severity and violence everything thrown into it. So he will be the greatest loser. He expressed with it in contrast to preparation with wealth which drives one to disdain creation. The Master 'Abu Al-Hasan Al-Harralli' said:..",

And He magnified its matter by His saying: (And what can make you know... what is the Crusher... It is the fire of Allah... Kindled). When He described the Scorner (*Hamaz*) and Mocker (*Lamaz*), He described the Crusher (*Hatim*), so He Almighty said (Which). And since the conditions of a thing are only viewed from its front through knowledge, He said (Mounts (*Tattali'u*)) a severe mounting (over the hearts (*Af'idah*)) plural of *Fu'ad*: which is the heart that almost burns from the intensity of its blaze/intelligence (*Dhakai'hi*). He should have used his intelligence in causes of salvation. And its mounting over it is by rising over its center and encompassing it with a profound encompassing. It was named so for the intensity of its burning. It was singled out for mention because it is the subtlest thing in the body and the most severely pained by the slightest harm, and because it is the origin of corrupt beliefs and the mine of the love of wealth which is the origin of corruption and misguidance, and from it issue ugly actions\" (1). \"Al-Biqa'i\" glances a high proportionality between the signification of the material of the verb \"Nabdh\" (throw) and the crimes committed by those scorners and mockers reckless in gathering wealth. So their punishment was a great humiliation and extreme hatred balanced with what came from them. If we look at the places where words of this material came in the Holy Quran, we see that meaning dominating it, confirming that it is selected to highlight it in the context where it appears: (Al-Baqarah: 100, 101, Al-Imran: 187, Al-Anfal: 58, Al-Qasas: 40, Adh-Dhariyat: 40, Al-Qalam: 49). Likewise, the expression about the Fire with the name *Al-Hutamah*, declaring the signification of crushing and breaking with violence, has a high proportionality with the context in which the verse came.",

If we look into the signification of words of this material in the Holy Quran, we see that meaning also dominating it, confirming that it is selected to highlight it in the context where it appears (An-Naml: 18, Az-Zumar: 21, Al-Waqi'ah: 65, Al-Hadid: 20). The indication of \"Al-Harralli\" which \"Al-Biqa'i\" quoted from him regarding the names of \"The Fire\" and the locations of expression with every name in the Holy Quran was a glorious indication carrying much subtle meaning. This draws our attention to the importance of pausing at the expression with names of Recompense for obediences and sins and the relationship of that to what corresponds to it of servants' earning, whether good or evil. In this is a clarification from Allah Almighty to His servants that their recompense is of the type of their deeds, so the servant must choose the recompense he wants. This highlights the great responsibility of the servant for what his hands earned. Added to what preceded of proportionality of the material's signification to the context is what that selection produced of tonal proportionality between: \"Humazah, Lumazah, Hutamah\". This harmony has effectiveness in highlighting meanings and depicting them. Al-Biqa'i, as you saw, has the ability to perceive the status of selecting words for the signification of their material which summons in the recipient's heart the reality which the Holy Quran educates the human soul by casting into hearts.

    "text": "If we placed the word \"yutrahanna\" (will be cast) in place of \"yunbadhanna\" (will be thrown) in other than the Holy Quran, and the word \"Al-Nar\" (The Fire) in place of \"Al-Hutamah\", the context would reject that, and the expression would lack much of what performs what it is driven to. *** The Holy Quran selects a word in a context by which it depicts what burns in the hidden recesses of a people whose speech it relates, so the word, by what it depicts in its context, becomes the exposer of them. Allah Almighty says relating the speech of the Hypocrites in Surah \"Al-Ahzab\": {And when a faction of them said, \"O people of Yathrib, there is no stability for you [here], so return [home].\" And a party of them asked permission of the Prophet, saying, \"Indeed, our houses are exposed,\" while they were not exposed. They did not intend except to flee.} (Al-Ahzab: 13). The word (Yathrib) did not come in other than this verse. The word \"Tathrib\" (blame), which is from its material, came in Surah (Yusuf: 92) {He said, \"No blame (*tathrib*) will there be upon you today. Allah will forgive you; and He is the most merciful of the merciful.\"}. \"Al-Biqa'i\" says: \"They diverted from the name - with which the Prophet (peace be upon him and his family and companions and abundant salutation) marked it, like Al-Madinah and Taybah, despite its goodness - to the name it was called by of old, with the probability of its ugliness by derivation from 'Al-Tharb' which is blame and violent reproof, to show diversion from Islam. It says in 'Al-Jam' bayn Al-Ubab wa Al-Muhkam': 'Tharraba alayhi tharban wa athraban', meaning *tharaba tathriban* if he blamed him, shamed him for his sin, and reminded him of it\" (1). This word carries by the signification of its material (Th - R - B) the meaning of rebuke and shaming with the defect of what those Hypocrites allude to of violently reproving those standing for the victory of Islam and His Messenger (peace be upon him and his family and companions and abundant salutation).",

This depicts what churns in their chests of hypocrisy. Allah Almighty spoke the truth: {...You would recognize them by their mark, and you will surely recognize them by the tone of [their] speech. And Allah knows your deeds.} (Muhammad: 30). So this word in the context of the Hypocrites discouraging the resolve of the Muslims is extremely familiar to its station. It is the word most specific to that meaning, most complete for it, and most revealing of it. It exposes what the Hypocrites strive to hide and cover. In \"Al-Biqa'i's\" observation of that Quranic indication is a refutation of what some modernists criticize our heritage for, that its owners in their rhetorical understanding do not observe the correspondence of expression to the internal states passing through the souls of speakers, thus picking up psychological secrets from within the folds of linguistic secrets. *** \"Al-Biqa'i\" glances in the selection of another word what reveals the reality of the Hypocrites' minds in the context of the same Surah in the saying of the Majestic, His Majesty: {They think (*yahsabuna*) the companies have not [yet] withdrawn. And if the companies should come [again], they would wish they were in the desert among the Bedouins, inquiring [from afar] about your news. And if they should be among you, they would not fight except for a little.} (Al-Ahzab: 20).

So these [Hypocrites] are worthy of such punishment for turning speech from its face. The material 'Ifk' in every arrangement revolves around turning/inversion.

He pointed to the specificity of this word in its indication of the reality of the state of the Hypocrites whom the context is about. It also casts into the heart of the recipient a realization of the extent of ugliness hypocrisy reaches, from which the sound soul flees. If the innate nature flees from the deed of the disbelievers from the nation of our master Lot, upon him be blessings and peace, then Hypocrisy is from the chapter of this deed, so the sound nature and the healthy heart are more averse to it. *** If the Holy Quranic Expression is based on (Rhetorical Derivation), this derivation includes what is known as Similar Order (*Mutashabih al-Nazm*), and I have pointed to some of it. It may also include a derivation in choosing the word in terms of its material in one context, and choosing another in another context. This is not of Similar Order because the derivation does not return to the order of the word but to choosing it itself in terms of its material or form. From that is what you see in the saying of Allah Almighty in Surah \"Al-Baqarah\" (v: 60): {And [recall] when Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, \"Strike with your staff the stone.\" And there gushed forth (*fanjafarat*) from it twelve springs.

    "text": "The expression came, as you see, in Surah Al-Baqarah with His saying (infajarat - gushed forth) and in Surah Al-A'raf (inbajasat - flowed out), and it is not hidden that they are not equal in their signification, for *infijar* (explosion/gushing) is greater than *inbijas* (flowing/oozing). So what is the effect of the context in selecting each word in its respective place? \"Al-Biqa'i\" says: \"And how appropriate is the mention of *infijar* here after concluding what came before with *fisq* (transgression), due to their sharing the meaning of exiting from a boundary: this is an exit that gives life, and that is an exit that causes death. 'Al-Harralli' said: *Infijar* is the emission of something from a contained object, or as if it is a container whose vessel split and burst open from it; from it comes the *Fajr* (dawn) and the splitting of the night from it. End quote. And because this is a context of gratitude and reminding of favors, He expressed it with *infijar*, whose meaning revolves around splitting involving flowing and emission with spreading, expansion, and abundance. And since the context of 'Al-A'raf' was not for gratitude, He expressed it with *inbijas*, whose meaning revolves around mere appearance and welling up\" (1). So the context is what necessitated selecting *infijar* in Surah \"Al-Baqarah\" and *inbijas* in Surah \"Al-A'raf\". If you look at the immediate circle of context in Surah \"Al-Baqarah\", you find it started from verse forty: {O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant upon you that I will fulfill your covenant with Me, and be afraid of [only] Me} with reminding the Children of Israel of the favors bestowed upon them, yet nothing came from them except persistence in misguidance, to alienate the Nation of Muhammad from following their methodology and law. As for the immediate context in Surah \"Al-A'raf\", it is apparent in depicting the Israelites' haste into misguidance; you see it starting with His saying Almighty: {Then We sent after them Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his establishment, but they were unjust toward them. So see how was the end of the corrupters} (Al-A'raf: 103). Thus, it was more fitting and appropriate for the context of the verse in Surah \"Al-Baqarah\" to select the word more indicative of the strength of the event (infajarat), unlike the context of the verse in Surah \"Al-A'raf\". ***",

And they found therein a wall about to collapse, so he restored it. [Moses] said, \"If you wished, you could have taken for it a payment.\"} and His saying in it (v: 82) {And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city (*Madinah*), and there was beneath it a treasure for them, and their father had been righteous. So your Lord intended that they reach their maturity and extract their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. And I did it not of my own accord. That is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience.} In the first, He said (*Qaryah* - town/village) and in the other He said (*Madinah* - city), and the intended place is one and the same.

He says regarding the first (v: 77): \"He expressed it - here - as *Qaryah* rather than *Madinah* because it is more indicative of blame; for the root material 'Qara'a' revolves around gathering (*jam'*), which necessitates withholding (*imsak*)... Then He described it to show that it had a part in the meanness of its people by His saying Almighty 'they asked for food'. He made the noun explicit and did not use a pronoun in His saying 'its people' because the asking for food was to some of those they came to, or [alternatively] the coming and the asking for food were to some, but it is not unified [meaning not everyone they came to was asked], and this is the apparent meaning; because it is what agrees with custom\" (1).

    "text": "\"Since *Qaryah* does not contradict naming it *Madinah*, and expressing it as *Qaryah* first was more appropriate because it is derived from the meaning of gathering, it was more fitting for blame regarding the refusal of hospitality; to indicate their stinginess while in a state of gathering, and their love for accumulating and withholding. And *Madinah* implies residence (*Iqamah*), so expressing with it was more appropriate [in the second verse] to indicate that the people are residing in it, so the wall would collapse while they are residing, and they would take the treasure\" (1). \"Al-Biqa'i\" intended to look at what the root of each of the two words \"Qaryah\" and \"Madinah\" is based on and what is intended from the verse of each. He perceived a proportionality between the material of each and its context and objective: The word \"Qaryah\" is based on the meaning of gathering; the Qaf, Ra, and the third letter contain the meaning of gathering. This summons in the heart of the recipient the meaning of the gathering of its people. The verse came in the context of highlighting that the people of that spot are characterized by the vice of stinginess and turning away from honoring guests, and that they are united upon the like of this. This is the most extreme stinginess; because one who is stingy while the people are in a gathering, his stinginess as an individual is greater. And in it is a blame that there is no one among them to forbid them from that vice, as if it became among them a recognized norm (*Ma'ruf*) not denounced, and this is transforming evil into good; if a nation reaches that, it is void of all virtue. In selecting this root material, there is proportionality with the context of exaggeration in blaming them. This explanation is supported by His saying: \"they asked its people for food\" and His saying \"but they refused to offer them hospitality\". The word \"Madinah\" highlights another meaning which is more appropriate for justifying the rebuilding of the wall: the roots of this word revolve around the meaning of residence (*Iqamah*). The verse came in the context of explaining the reason for what he did, and that had the righteous servant not rebuilt the wall, it would have collapsed, and the residence of those people around it would have helped hasten its collapse, making it prone to being looted. So the meaning of \"Residence\", which is the center of the signification of the material \"Madana\", is what is proportionate to the reason for building that wall.",

The word (*'Aam*) came nine times (Al-Baqarah: 259, 259 - At-Tawbah: 28, 37, 37, 126 - Yusuf: 49 - Al-Ankabut: 14 - Luqman: 14). The word (*Hawl*) came in two verses of Surah Al-Baqarah (v: 233, 240). And the word (*Hijjah*) came in a verse of Al-Qasas (v: 27). The prevailing view among rhetoricians is that the word \"Sanah\" is mostly used for a year containing drought and hardship, and \"'Aam\" for one containing prosperity and fertility. It is said \"The people suffered *Sanah*\" meaning drought struck them, as Al-Raghib says in \"Al-Mufradat\". Al-Biqa'i points out in some places these differences. Among that is what you see in his interpretation of the saying of Allah Almighty: {And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with Allah. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years (*Sanah*), but it would not remove him from the punishment that he should be granted life. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.} (Al-Baqarah: 96)",

    "text": "He says: \"...And *Al-Sanah*: The duration of a complete cycle of the sun and the completion of twelve cycles of the moon - said Al-Harralli. This meaning, although present in *Al-Hawl*, *Al-'Aam*, and *Al-Hijjah*, yet the source of derivation is noted in the sentence. The rhetoric of the Holy Quran does not use any of these terms except where it suits the context from the origin of the derivation of these terms. This context, since the intent is to blame them for their desperation to remain in the world in any condition, knowing that it—even if it were the worst of conditions—is better for them than what is after death due to the realization of their misery, He expressed it with that from which *Al-Isnat* (drought) comes, which is famine and bad times. Or [it is] from that which involves rotation containing toil and fatigue, if its origin is from *Sana Yasnu* meaning when the beast turns around the well. Al-Suhayli said in 'Al-Rawd': A *Sanah* may be called a *Dar* (abode/cycle) in the report: 'Between Adam, peace be upon him, and Noah, peace be upon him, are a thousand *Dar*', meaning *Sanah*. Then he said: So contemplate this, for knowledge of the placement of speech and putting words in their appropriate places opens a door of knowledge regarding the inimitability of the Quran, and Allah is the One sought for help)) (1). And in the saying of Allah Almighty: {And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years (*Sanah*) minus fifty years (*'Aam*), and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers} (Al-Ankabut: 14), he looks at the reason for expressing first with *Sanah* and lastly with *'Aam*. He says: \"...He expressed with the word 'Sanah' to condemn the days of disbelief, and said 'minus fifty... 'Aam' to indicate that the time of his life, peace be upon him, after their drowning was comfortable, spacious, and good due to the faith of the believers and the fertility of the land\" (2). So the days of struggle were days of suffering for him, so the word (*Sanah*) is most appropriate for them. And they were days of blame regarding their actions—disbelief—so the word \"Sanah\" also suits them, due to what it carries of its root material which I explained before. As for what was after the flood, with the drowning of the disbelievers and the salvation of the believers, they were days of spiritual spaciousness through faith and sensory spaciousness through the fertility of the land and abundance of blessings.",

The word (*Hawl*) contains the meaning of separation and change from one attribute to another; hence the changing state is called *Hal* (condition), meaning it does not remain as it is but transforms (*Yahul*) and changes. Al-Biqa'i contemplates the meaning of transformation in this verse saying: \"When He mentioned breastfeeding, He mentioned its duration. Since the intent was merely the turning (*Tahawwul*) of time with its four seasons and the sun returning after traversing the twelve zodiac signs to the sign it was in at birth, and the intent is not to imply praise of the time nor blame, nor describing it with tightness or expanse, He expressed it with what indicates absolute transformation, so He said (*Hawlayn* - two turns/years)... as if it is taken from what has the power of transformation\" (1).",

    "text": "Al-Biqa'i proceeds to explain firstly what is intended by the verse and secondly what is not intended. It becomes clear to him that the intent points to the meaning of transformation and change that occurs to the newborn due to breastfeeding. These two years are among the years in which the change of the newborn's state appears most in all its sensory and moral fields. If you looked at his state at birth and his state at the completion of his weaning, you would see a transformation and change the like of which you cannot see in any two years passing over the newborn afterwards. So this period is the most deserving of his life's periods of the meaning of transformation. Furthermore, it is not intended to point to an attribute related to the time in which breastfeeding occurs, whether of abundance of blessing or its scarcity, so that it is not understood that the ruling relates to that attribute of abundance or scarcity. This is from the perfection of protecting the listener of the Quranic expression from understanding from the statement other than what is intended. Such is considered by scholars of rhetoric as one of the fundamentals of eloquence: That the listener should not be misled by the speaker's poor explanation (1). *** The expression also came with the word (*Hawl*) in the same Surah (v: 240) {And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind - for their wives is a bequest: maintenance for one year (*Hawl*) without turning [them] out...} (Al-Baqarah: 240). Al-Biqa'i did not mention anything of his own in this verse, sufficing with quoting \"Al-Harralli\" explaining an aspect of the wisdom of making the waiting period (*Iddah*) of the widow four months and ten days completed to a year (*Hawl*), and that the verse does not contain abrogation, and the wisdom of making its interval {And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise} (2). *** And the expression came with the word \"Hijjah\" in a verse from Surah Al-Qasas:",

    "text": "{He said, \"Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years (*Hijaj*); but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you. And I do not wish to put you in difficulty. You will find me, if Allah wills, from among the righteous.\"} (Al-Qasas: 27). Al-Biqa'i explains the facet of emphasis in (*Inni* - Indeed I), the facet of expression with the word (*Ankihuka* - wed you), the facet of pointing with (*Hatayn* - these two), and the facet of making it eight *Hijaj*. Then he looks into the selection of the word *Hijaj* over other similar words like *Sanah*, *'Aam*, or *Hawl*, saying: \"And the expression with what is from *Hajj*, which is intent (*Qasd*), is out of optimism that they [the years] will be—due to their goodness through following Allah's command, the abundance of His provision, the pouring of blessing, and the repelling of vengeance—worthy of being intended (*Tuqsad*), or that Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah will happen in each one of them\" (1). \"Al-Biqa'i\" summons from the material of the word (*Hajaj*) the meaning of intent (*Qasd*) which is the standing basis in its derivations, and what this meaning acquired from the legal status of the word (*Hajj*). It is an enticement that this should be something one strives to intend and care for, and that he should feel that in these eight [years] he is in the status of a pilgrim (*Hajj*) turning away from all his own affairs and desiring the lot of his master, not occupied from him by anything of his own affair or the affair of other than his master. And that his relationship with things around him should be the relationship of the pilgrim with what is around him in the Sanctuary: endless peace. He also summons what accompanied this legal meaning of connotations tossed in the soul regarding optimism for the blessing that correlates with Hajj from the supplication of the father of prophets Abraham, peace be upon him, and what occurs of negating poverty and affliction. He points to the probability that this contains a condition that he carries him to Hajj every year of these eight. Thus, \"Al-Biqa'i's\" methodology becomes clear to you in sensing the connotations of the word acquired from its context added to what is generated from its etymological root and linguistic origin from which it sprouted. ***",

In Surah \"Al-Baqarah\", the expression came with the word \"Iblis\" in the context of refusing prostration (v: 34), and in \"Al-A'raf\" (v: 11), Al-Hijr (v: 31), Al-Isra (v: 61), and Taha (v: 116). In the context of misleading Adam and Eve, the expression about him came with the word \"Shaytan\"; it came in Al-Baqarah (v: 36), Al-A'raf (v: 20), and Taha (v: 120). These are two names for a single entity, except that the Holy Quran selects each name in a context different from the one where it selects the other, due to the proportionality of the signification of each word's root material to the context of its occurrence. \"Al-Biqa'i\" quotes regarding His saying Almighty: {And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate before Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblis. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.} (Al-Baqarah: 34) from \"Abu Al-Hasan Al-Harralli\" regarding this: \"Iblis\": \"From *Al-Iblas*, which is the cutting off of the cause of hope, which comes from despair due to the cutting of that cause\" (1). And he quotes from him regarding the saying of Allah Almighty: {But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, \"Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time.\"} (Al-Baqarah: 36) his saying: ((The Shaytan: It is taken from two roots: from *Al-Shatan* which is distance, from which the long rope is named, and from *Al-Shayt* which is acceleration in burning... so it is derived from the two meanings like the word \"Insan\" (human) and \"Mala'ikah\" (angels))) (2). The word Shaytan is derived from two roots, meaning carved from them.

So there was in that a glad tiding of Adam, peace be upon him, rectifying [the slip] through repentance)) (1). The expression using the word \"Iblis\" in the context of abandoning prostration indicates what gripped the enemy of Allah in this context of despair and cutting off hope of being among the people of preference and proximity. Selecting this word: \"Iblis\" in this context suggested the internal image of Iblis when commanded to prostrate upon his refusal of what he was commanded. This depicts to us the great torment in which the enemy of Allah was placed by this. Understanding this helps the servant know the motives driving the enemy of Allah to take a stance of raging hostility against the sons of Adam, peace be upon him, so the human does not trust him nor feel safe with what he tempts him with of the trials of worldly life. And the expression with the word \"Shaytan\" in the context of misleading our father Adam, peace be upon him, indicates what his struggle in misleading the people of obedience will end in: that his effect is finite, vanishing quickly. Every attempt of his with one characterized by understanding of his state and position is destined to burn. Every attempt of seduction is burned by sincere repentance if the human returns to it. There is no greater loser than one whose great struggle in seduction burns away with a truthful word the person says, depicting what churns in his chest of remorse and fear.",

    "text": "You can utilize \"Al-Harralli's\" statement to see that the word \"Iblis\" in its indication of \"despair and confusion\" points out that the enemy of Allah, at the beginning of his affair when commanded to prostrate, was confused between the analogies of his mind and his weighings between clay and fire, and the calls of the heart to submit to the Divine Command to prostrate. He lived first in confusion, then inclined to the voice of reason and its analogy, declaring: \"I am better than him\", \"Shall I prostrate to one You created from clay?\". As for the angels, they submitted with absolute surrender to what Allah Almighty wanted from them, and did not stand in the position of confusion that \"Iblis\" stood in. Consequently, what the \"enemy of Allah\" inclined to resulted in his expulsion from the mercy of Allah Almighty, and he was burned by His anger upon him, so he became a defeated Shaytan burned by the curse of Allah Almighty (1). Perhaps what brings this closer is that the Holy Quran does not apply the word \"Iblis\" except to the first of devils in existence, the one commanded to prostrate. Had the word \"Iblis\" been used in the context of seduction and temptation, there would have been great despair for the sons of Adam in this. But the overflow of Mercy (*Rahmaniyyah* and *Rahimiyyah*) manifested in selecting the word \"Shaytan\" in this context. This is among the subtleties of the *Ihsani* (Ehsan-based) meanings of the Holy Quran which only the people of *Ihsan* in understanding the Quran's rhetoric pay attention to. ***",

Some may be more apparent and abundant, but they do not negate the giving of the other. Therefore, if \"Al-Biqa'i\" was concerned with the proportionality and interweaving between the signification of the word's material and its context and the significance for which speech is established, he also has concern for the signification of the word's form and shape and its proportionality with the context and intent for which speech is set up.

His saying Almighty: {Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you are believers?\"} (Al-Baqarah: from verse 91) is decisive in that.\" (1) The Present Tense in these verbs notes the meaning of occurrence after it was not. Therefore, it includes everyone from whom the action occurred before the revelation of the Medinan verse, and everyone from whom it occurs or will occur until the Hour. It was not brought as a description (The Believers - The Establishers - The Spenders) to intend the indication of renewal, which is one of the characteristics of verbs. The context is one of clarifying who the Holy Quran is beneficial for, and they are the ones guarding against the path of those who earned anger and the path of the astray. The existence of these pious ones is not restricted to a specific time. These actions occur in every time wherein the pious exist. So it was most appropriate for the Present Tense to come to indicate that continuity. The Past Tense did not come lest it be imagined that this is specific to those from whom those actions occurred [in the past], while others are not, or that they are lesser than them in guarding against the path of those earned anger and the path of the astray and lesser than them in guidance by the Holy Quran. That would not fit the intent aimed at by the verses in the opening of Surah \"Al-Baqarah\". *** As for the Present Tense in the saying of Allah Almighty: {And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what Allah has revealed,\" they say, \"We believe [only] in what was revealed to us.\" And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why do you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you are [indeed] believers?\"} (Al-Baqarah: 91). It came contrary to the requirement of the apparent context, for the requirement of the apparent was to say: \"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before\", because His saying (before) indicates that the killing whose occurrence is denounced happened before the address.

For the estimation is: And you persist in killing them afterwards.

So Al-Biqa'i sees in the expression using the Present Tense here, accompanied by the clue indicating the occurrence of the event in the past time (before), an indication of the intent to depict the ugliness of what occurred from their ancestors, and that they are pleased with it, not denying it, and that they are thereby like one participating in causing it. And that if an opportunity arose for them, they would not hesitate to seize it; nothing prevents them from it except inability or fear.

So the action of their ancestors is as if it stands in its essence, form, and degree within them. In this clarification of their state for the Muslims, there is what is not hidden from a sane person. However, those affiliated with Islam by inheritance among the great politicians, intellectuals, advocates of enlightenment, sons of the new era, and peace activists do not see this.

It came in the context of Allah Almighty confirming that what He promised of Resurrection and Recompense is Truth, in which there is no doubt, and His prohibition against falling into the deception of the world and Satan: {O mankind, indeed the promise of Allah is truth, so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deluded about Allah by the Deceiver.} (Fatir: 5).

Or: Allah who sends [Present] the winds so they stir up clouds, as in Surah (Ar-Rum): {It is Allah who sends the winds, so they stir up clouds, and He spreads them in the sky how He wills and breaks them into fragments, and you see the rain emerge from within them. And when He causes it to fall upon whom He wills of His servants, immediately they rejoice} (Ar-Rum: 48).

That returns to the nature of the event: (Stirring) and its position regarding the Intent aimed at by the verse (Thus is the resurrection).

    "text": "\"When He Almighty informed that the existence of what He promised of Resurrection and other things is inevitable, and warned with every warning against taking His command lightly, and denounced equating the believer in it with the denier; and the cause of the heart-killing misguidance was Desires which cover the sky of the intellect and top it with their dark cloud, preventing it from penetration; and the cause of the clouds covering the sky [and] watering the earth reviving the dead grains was the Wind; and the cause of bringing it at one time and not another indicated Power by Choice, He said conjoining to the sentence {Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth} based on looking/reasoning, which is bringing out of non-existence, clarifying His Power over what He promised: (And Allah)... (who). Since the intent is bringing into existence from non-existence, He expressed with the Past Tense attributed to Him, because He is the Real Doer, saying: (Sent the winds) i.e., created them from nothing turbulent in it [the atmosphere], fit for turbulence and movement so He directs them how He wills, not fixed like the earth, and settled them between the horizons for the benefit of the earth's place. Since their stirring renews whenever He wants to water a land, He said attributing it to the winds; because they are the cause, expressing with the Present Tense narrating the state, to summon that marvelous image indicating complete Power. This is how Arabs do in matters containing wonder for the listener, urging him to contemplate and imagine it (so they stir up) i.e., by His moving them if He wills (clouds) i.e., that He Almighty ran His Sunnah that His wisdom appears gradually. Since the intent is deducing the Ability for Resurrection, and expression with the Present Tense refutes obstinacy, He expressed with the Present Tense. Since driving clouds to one land and not another and watering a place and not another is of a status of greatness, He turned from the third person [singular] and put it in the manifestation of Greatness [plural/royal we], saying (and We drove it) i.e., the clouds, expressing with the Past Tense to alert that every driving was after their stirring in the past and future from Him alone or through the mediation of those of His soldiers of angels or others He established for that, not from anyone else. He indicated that there is no difference between far and near by the particle of destination, saying (to a dead land).",

    "text": "And since the cause of life is the clouds due to the water arising from them, He said: {and gave life thereby to the earth}. And since the intent is guiding them to the Ability for Resurrection which they deny, He said removing metaphor by every estimation and clarifying the depiction with every clarification: (after its lifelessness... thus is... the Resurrection)\" (1). \"Al-Biqa'i\" noticed the signification of the Present Tense in depicting the event, and establishing it before the eyes of the addressee as if it is happening, so nothing blocks him from insight into it and taking a lesson except a barrier from his own self. The expression came with the Present Tense in the verb whose event in the universe is most indicative of the occurrence of the Resurrection for which the context is set, which is the event of Stirring (so they stir up). This Stirring is like the stirring of the dead from their graves. He who stirred clouds to revive a dead land with them is capable of stirring the dead from their graves in that land. So the Present Tense here was the one capable of achieving the Intent, and it was the most friendly to the context. That it was preceded by a past tense and followed by a past tense did not prevent establishing it in its station, for sterile formal consistency does not repel the care for establishing noble, generous semantic consistency. It is not important, then, to say that the Present Tense depicts the event and summons it before the eyes of the addressee, but the most important thing is realizing the consistency between the context, the intent, and the verb selected for the diversion from Past to Present to occur in it. Not every verb of the verse's verbs is fit for that diversion from Past to Present to occur in it; rather, the reference in this is to the nature of this verb's event and its relationship to the context and the purpose for which the speech is set.",

    "text": "It is clear that some rhetoricians consider such Rhetorical Derivation based on diverting from \"Past\" in (sent the winds) to \"Present\" in (so they stir up clouds) as a type of *Iltifat* (Enallage/Shift), which is of the boldness of Arabic. They do not restrict \"Iltifat\" to changing types of \"Pronouns\" referring to the same referent, as holds the majority of rhetoricians. Among those who count such a verse as \"Iltifat\" is \"Al-Diya ibn al-Athir\" (d. 637 AH) in \"Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir\", and I have detailed the discussion on his methodology in my book {Reading in Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir}. *** \"Al-Biqa'i\" contemplates the position of the \"Present Tense\" between two Active Participles (Subject Nouns) in the saying of the Truth Almighty {Indeed, Allah is the cleaver (*Faliq*) of grain and date seeds. He brings out (*Yukhriju*) the living from the dead and brings out (*Mukhrij*) the dead from the living. That is Allah; so how are you deluded?} (Al-An'am: 95). He points out that the meaning of (*Faliq* of grain and date seeds) is its originator and splitter for crops and plants. He expressed it that way because the thing before its existence was non-existent, and the mind imagines and fancies from non-existence a continuous darkness. When it is brought out from pure non-existence and sheer annihilation, it is as if, according to imagination and fancy, it split that non-existence\" (1). So splitting the grain and date seeds is a type of giving life, i.e., bringing out the living from the dead, because in plants there is growth. From here, \"The Truth Almighty explained the meaning of splitting and clarified it, indicating care for it time after time, by His saying 'He brings out' (*Yukhriju*) by way of renewal and continuity, affirming the matter of Resurrection (the living... from the dead)... And when its meaning was revealed and its significance became clear by bringing out things from their opposites—lest it be imagined, if nothing came out of a thing except its like, that the doer is Nature and Property—He conjoined to *Faliq*, increasing in clarification, His saying expressing with the Active Participle indicating stability, because they have no dispute regarding it, so the need did not call for expressing with the verb indicating renewal (and brings out (*Mukhrij*) the dead... from the living) (2).",

    "text": "The Present Tense in: (He brings out the living) reveals the reality of His saying: (cleaver/*Faliq*). In the expression with the Present Tense here is proportionality with the specific context of the verse, which is Resurrection, as is not hidden, and with the general context, the Greatest Objective of Surah \"Al-An'am\", which is the First Creation, and Praise to Allah for it. So He combined the two Creations: The first explicitly, and the second implicitly. At the same time, expression with the Present Tense in \"He brings out the living\" fits the nature of movement, renewal, and variety of the event. When the meaning of (*Faliq*) was revealed by this, He diverted to the Active Participle (*Mukhrij*) and conjoined it to the Active Participle (*Faliq*). The expression with the Active Participle in (*Mukhrij* the dead) fits also the nature of the thing brought out: \"the dead\", for it is stable, not moving, and finished, not renewing. It also fits the state of the addressees, for they are not in need of summoning that event before their eyes with the Present Tense to penetrate their hearts if they take heed; because they do not deny it such that the expression with the Present Tense would come announcing that He who is capable of what your eyes see is capable of what you are informed of truthfully and rightfully. Hence, the expression was with the Active Participle (bringer out of the dead) and its conjunction to the Active Participle, its counterpart (*Faliq*), not to the Present Tense before it (He brings out the living). *** Previously, the \"Present Tense\" came in the company of an \"Active Participle\". The \"Present Tense\" may come in the company of a \"Passive Participle\" as in the saying of Allah Almighty: {Be patient over what they say and remember Our servant, David, the possessor of strength; indeed, he was one who repeatedly turned back [to Allah]. * Indeed, We subjected the mountains to praise with him (*Yusabbihna*), in the evening and sunrise. * And the birds gathered (*Mahshurah*), all of them repeating [praises] to Him. * And We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and discernment in speech.} (Sad: 17-20). He made the praising of the mountains in the form of \"Present Tense\" (*Yusabbihna*) and the gathering of birds in the form of Passive Participle (*Mahshurah*). In this is proportionality and brotherhood with the context and the intended meaning thereof, and the nature of the event in each, and its doer and object. Al-Biqa'i says:",

    "text": "\"Since the existence of praising from the mountains bit by bit is more wondrous, because they are inanimate, He expressed with the Present Tense verb. He said depicting that state, expressing with the feminine pronoun to indicate that after their hardness, they became in extreme softness and looseness, each mountain of them praising with a voice unlike the voice of the other, because that is closer to distinguishing and knowing the praising of each individually 'they praise (*yusabbihna*)'. He did not say 'praising (*musabbiha*)' or 'she praises (*tusabbihu*)'; lest it be thought that their praising is with one voice confusing the matter in some of them. It can be [grammatically] a new sentence (Ist'inaf), or a circumstantial phrase (Hal) meaning that they yield to him with praising in word and state, the yielding of a chosen one obeying him. Since it was in the context of Returning (*Awbah*), and the end of the day is the time of return for everyone accustomed to what he is accustomed to, while it is a time of lethargy and resting from troubles, He said: 'in the evening' i.e., strengthening the worker and reminding the heedless. And since it was in the context of Overflow and honoring with the Quran, He said: 'and sunrise (*Ishraq*)' i.e., the time of the sun's elevation when people spread out. *Ishraq* is not the rising of the sun (*Tulu'*), but its clarity and light; its rising is *Shuruq*... And when He Almighty informed of subjecting the heaviest and most stable things to him, He followed it with the lightest and most mobile of them. He expressed regarding them with the Noun indicating gathering all at once and stability, because it is more indicative of Power. He said expressing with the Collective Noun instead of the Plural to indicate that in the intensity of gathering, they are like one thing. He mentioned their state in a description suitable for the singular and made it feminine to indicate what preceded of looseness necessary for females, necessitating the utmost obedience and acceptance of the disposition of rulings 'and the birds' i.e., We subjected them to him while being 'gathered (*mahshurah*)' i.e., collected to him by compulsion from every side all at once, by what the expression with the Noun instead of the Verb indicated.

Whenever he returned from his ruling and what he was occupied with of creation to praising the Truth, the mountains and birds returned with him in that. He made the predicate singular [i.e., *awwab*] to indicate that in obedience in discipline, they reached the limit as if they were a single thing. He did not make it feminine to indicate the intensity of their clamor in discipline and its greatness. Singularity - also - implies ruling upon every individual; had it been pluralized, the possibility would arise that the judgment is on the aggregate with the restriction of being a group. As if David, peace be upon him, understands the praising of mountains and birds, and each of them submits to him if he commands it to praise. 'And whoever realizes his state, everything assists him' - said Al-Qushayri. In this is an indication to the Prophet (peace be upon him and his family and companions and abundant salutations) that: Whenever We wish, We make your people with you in subjection like this. So do not despair of them despite the severity of their aversion and the strength of their ugliness and conceit. For We made them so that you may discipline yourself with them and increase by patience over them in majesty, loftiness, elevation, and perfection, to other wisdoms that minds cannot encompass. And do not despair of their softening to you and their returning to you, for they do not exceed being like mountains in strength and hardness or birds in aversion, recklessness, and lightness. Whenever We wish, We make them for you like We made the mountains and birds with David, peace be upon him; rather their matter is easier and their affair is lighter\" (1).",

    "text": "The context in which these verses descended is to provide evidence for the perfection of Power and Absolute Dominance of Allah Almighty over the universes: {How many a generation have We destroyed before them, and they called out when it was no time for escape} (Sad: 3) to the end of the verses. In conjoining His saying (Remember Our servant David...) to \"Be patient\" is an indication that in the story of \"David\", peace be upon him, is what confirms the absolute capability of Power and Dominance. Therefore, this story was selected in this location of the context, and these events from the stories of David, peace be upon him, were selected here for their great proportionality and interweaving with the context. This is of a high status in the science of Quranic Proportionality. The context, as I said, is for indicating the perfection of Power and Absolute Divine Dominance over all universes. What suits this context is highlighting the event of Praising from the mountains in the form of renewal and continuous occurrence. That is because its issuance from them once is a clear proof of Power and Dominance, so how about when it is renewing and continuous?! Is that not an elevation of the evidence for the perfection of Power and Dominance and its inimitability? What gave it that is indeed the Present Tense attributed to the mountains expressed by a feminine pronoun. It also fits the context as it suggests extreme softness and submission, while they are the most solid of solids and hardest of hard things, as \"Al-Biqa'i\" highlighted the appropriateness of the expression with Evening and Sunrise and the appropriateness of the order in *Yusabbihna* rather than *Tusabbihu* or *Musabbiha*. As for the event of Gathering, highlighting it in the form of Passive Participle is what responds to the context first, the nature of the event second, and the nature of birds third. The power of gathering is complete when the gathering is all at once {Your creation and your resurrection are not but as that of a single soul. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing} (Luqman: 28). It is elevated if the gathered is of a nature of lightness and aversion like birds.",

    "text": "And it is marvelous that highlighting the event was in the form of a derived noun, increased by being a Passive Participle whose verb is only built for the unnamed doer (passive voice), to be understood that the doer of that will be none other than Allah Almighty. And to understand that the birds, as if from the intensity of dominance over them, strive by themselves, so they are gathered. Hence the event was attributed to them. This indicated that whoever is capable of this is more capable of gathering those who are less aversive than birds. In this is evidence for the Resurrection and the Great Gathering, and the context of Resurrection in this Surah is a broad context and a paved path. The Context – then – and the nature of the event and its doer or object is what necessitates a specific form for every element, and every element in the expression is subject to the dominance of a unified principle and one spirit, which is the Context and the Greatest Objective. I have seen Al-Biqa'i lingering at many significations of the form of the Quranic word and contemplating the proportionality of the facets of this form with the Context and Intent. As if he is looking in this at the saying of Imam \"Abdul Qahir\": \"It is not enough in the science of eloquence that you set up a measurement for it, and describe it with a general description, and say about it a general statement. Rather, you will not be of any knowledge of it until you detail the speech and acquire, and place your hand on the characteristics that appear in the order of words and count them one by one, and name them thing by thing.

Thus, the statement using the abstract form was not a deviation from the augmented form for a specific purpose regarding abstractness or augmentation. I did not neglect examining the accompanying verb and noun forms, as proper contemplation requires giving them their due right of pondering proportionality in this context. This is not a form of detestable mixing, for the insight into it was not the primary driver, but rather one of the consequences of the examination. We need, after this, to attempt to contemplate the statement using the augmented present and past verbs, looking at the form of augmentation in it and the proportionality of its indication with the context and the intent for which the speech is driven. \"Al-Biqa'i\" pauses, contemplating the Holy Qur'anic statement using the abstract verb form (Fa'ala) regarding good deeds, and the form (Ifta'ala) regarding bad deeds in the saying of Allah Almighty: (Al-Baqarah: from Verse 286) {Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned} ... Al-Biqa'i says: \"'Laha' (For it) meaning specifically for it 'ma kasabat' (what it gained); the verb is mentioned in the abstract form regarding good to imply that the mere occurrence of it is sufficient to be counted, even if done with laziness, or even the mere intention of it. 'Al-Haralli' said: The form 'Fa'ala' in the abstract expresses the minimum acquisition; therefore, whoever intends a good deed but does not do it, it is written for him as a good deed. End quote. 'Wa 'alayha' (And against it) meaning specifically against it 'ma iktasabat' (what it earned/acquired). So He conditioned the form of 'Ifti'al' regarding evil, which indicates exertion (I'timal), pointing to the fact that the nature of the self is to incline towards desire with its entirety, and that sin is not written except with determination and strong resolve. If an apparent action results from it, it is done with seriousness, energy, desire, and expansion. Therefore, whoever intends a bad deed but does not do it, it is not written against him. The expression may come contrary to that for a meaning in that context required by the situation\" (1). *** And he says regarding the saying of Allah Almighty:",

The combination of \"Kasaba\" and \"Iktasaba\" did not occur in other than this noble verse. The predominant usage is the coming of the abstract verb: \"Kasaba\" singly, intended for good at times and intended for evil at other times. The root: \"K - S - B\" appeared sixty-seven times; the abstract verb appeared \"sixty-two\" times, and the augmented verb \"Iktasaba\" appeared \"five\" times. The abstract verb came speaking about what is a bad deed in places including His saying, Mighty and Majestic: {Yes, whoever earns [kasaba] evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally} (Al-Baqarah: 81), {Allah does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He imposes blame upon you for what your hearts have earned [kasabat]...} (Al-Baqarah: 225), {Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned [kasabat]...} (Ar-Rum: 41), and many others.

The verses preceding it exaggerated in that alienation which makes the hearts of those who understand tear apart in fear of being involved in any of it, even if the people of misguidance, whose vision is clouded, call out among us morning and evening with the fabrication of human brotherhood across different beliefs, and singling out the calf-worshippers and the people of the cross with extra care for that brotherhood, while they carry nothing in the darkness of their chests except hatred, rage, and malice against every Muslim.",

    "text": "Al-Biqa'i says: \"When He clarified their stubbornness and that their enmity towards the people of this religion, which drove them to this great matter, has no enmity beyond it, He forbade those marked with Faith from allying with them; because no believer or rational person would do it after this clarification. So He said {O you who have believed}, meaning acknowledged Faith. And since a human does not ally with other than his own people except with diligence in preliminaries he performs and things he does to endear himself to those he wants to ally with, He indicated that with the form of 'Ifti'al', saying: {Do not take [la tattakhidhu]} meaning that even if that were easily attainable, you should not do it, so how about when it does not happen except by expending effort? {the Jews and the Christians as allies}, meaning relatives (close friends), doing with them what a relative does with his relative, and hoping from them the same, while they are the people who disdain and despise you the most...\" (1). Al-Biqa'i looks here at the nature of the sound human being, that he is innately disposed to grant his loyalty to those of his people who stand to support him, whether wrong or wronged. And that when this comes from him towards others, it does not stem from the metal of his instinct and nature; rather, he is the one burdening himself, exerting himself for that, and carrying himself to do what he does not naturally approach without training and practice. When he performs that loyalty to those who harbor enmity towards his people, he deafens his ears and locks the doors of his heart against the call of instinct and the call of Noble Revelation, crossing numerous barriers by this deed. This is what the form of Ifti'al, in which the prohibited verb came, suggests, giving the prohibition strength and emphasis. It is increased - in my view - by the indication of strength in causing loyalty found in the root of the verb, for the root \"Akhadha\" (to take) comes to indicate the strength of the action and that its doer strives in causing it or that its effect is very great and profound. This is what you realize in the verbs of this root in the Holy Qur'an's statement. Thus, the significance of the form and the root combined to portray the prohibition in this verse greatly.",

The Truth, Mighty and Majestic, says in Surah (Al-Ma'idah: 57): {O you who have believed, do not take [la tattakhidhu] those who have taken [ittakhadhu] your religion in ridicule and amusement among the ones who were given the Scripture before you and the disbelievers as allies. And fear Allah, if you should [truly] be believers}. This is from the distribution of meanings in the Holy Qur'anic statement to establish the main meaning in the hearts and direct [attention] to other meanings worthy of observation. Al-Biqa'i says: \"When He Almighty alerted to the causes preventing the alliance with disbelievers and restricted alliance to Himself Almighty, that definitively produced His saying alerting to other causes directing towards disavowal of them: {O you who have believed}, meaning acknowledged Faith. He alerted with the form of Ifti'al that whoever allies with them fights his intellect to do so, following his desire, so He said {do not take [la tattakhidhu]} those who took {ittakhadhu} meaning with utmost seriousness and diligence from them \"your religion... in ridicule and amusement...\" (1). In the previous verse, the call contained His saying \"some of them are allies of others,\" as if it contained an incitement for those who believed not to be less than them in this. So those who believe must be allies of one another, not allies of others. Therefore, He followed this incitement with intimidation and alienation by saying {And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them}. This cannot be borne by anyone with an atom of faith in his heart, because it contains a declaration of his negation from the group of those who believe and his relapse into the abyss of the Jews and Christians.",

    "text": "In the second prohibition came His saying: {Those who took your religion in ridicule and amusement} to heat them up and carry them to take a stance of jealousy and dignity against having affection for one who treats Islam with ridicule and play. If you were to ask that from someone with an atom of intellect among those attributing themselves to Islam—to accept the friendship of one who mocks Islam—he would refrain and refuse that it be from him. How many of those deep in disobedience would not accept a polytheist touching his religion with mockery, even if he is drowning in deviating from its guidance and law. Defining the object with the relative noun: {Those who took your religion in ridicule and amusement} conveys significant alienation from the prohibited act. *** Among the forms that the verb frequently appears in within the Holy Qur'anic statement is the form (Tafa''ala) with the doubling of the 'Ayn' and (Tafa'ala). Al-Biqa'i turns to perceiving the proportionality of each with the context in which they stand and the intent to which the statement is driven by its expression. He contemplates the saying of Allah Almighty: {He frowned and turned away [tawalla] * Because there came to him the blind man}. He sees in this statement using the verb (tawalla) in that form an utmost honoring and kindness to our Master Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He says: \"...He signaled his praise, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that that [i.e., frowning and turning away] is contrary to what He Almighty created him upon of mercy for the poor, love for them, and joy in their proximity and companionship, by His saying (wa tawalla - and turned away). Meaning, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, burdened himself to turn away from him hoping that those nobles he was addressing would submit [to Islam], so Islam would be strengthened by them, and their followers would submit by their submission, so the Word of Allah Almighty would rise; because (there came to him the blind man)\" (1).",

For the conjunction between the two verbs, each in a [specific] form, indicates the High Station upon which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was.

What increases the meaning in exposure is the statement about the act of addressing/attending to those leaders by His saying, Mighty and Majestic: {But as for he who thinks himself without need * To him you give attention [tasadda]}. He says: \"When He mentioned frowning and turning away from him, implying their opposites for the one who was approaching them, He clarified that, saying: {As for he who thinks himself without need} meaning sought wealth, which is money and riches, and found it, even if he did not fear or come to you {To him you give attention [tasadda]} meaning you expose yourself by turning to him and striving in admonishing him hoping for his submission and the submission of his followers by his submission...

All of this is proportionate to the general context of the Surah which stands on meanings of honoring and great praise; it is praise in the form of admonishment. This is from Al-Biqa'i an utmost achievement in analyzing and interpreting the elements of the Qur'anic statement in a manner that makes his methodology worthy of being a beacon guiding the ways of rhetorical analysis of forms of literary creativity in poetry and prose, and before that the High Miraculous Statement in the Qur'an and Sunnah. He addresses the form of the verb (Tazakka) and its proportionality with the context, saying: \"Since his action was the action of one who fears there might be blame upon him for their remaining in disbelief, He clarified to him that he is safe from that, saying Almighty: {And not upon you if he does not purify himself [yazzakka]} at all and from the start, even the slightest purification - indicated by the assimilation - for upon you is only the notification. It is possible that it is an interrogation (Istifham), meaning: And what thing is upon you in his lack of purification? In it is an indication that it is obligatory to strive in purifying the follower from whom acceptance is known\" (1). In the form (Tazakka: Tafa''ala) is an indication that this purification will not come from that person addressed by the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which prepares him to leave excess in addressing him, so he does not burden himself beyond what he is tasked with. Al-Biqa'i perceived the face of interrogation in this sentence and its harmony also with the indication of negation on this compassion for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.",

He says: \"When He mentioned the self-sufficient one, He mentioned his opposite, so He Almighty said: {But as for he who came to you striving [for knowledge] * While he fears [Allah] * From him you are distracted [talahha]} meaning specifically in that gathering; being in reality (talahha) meaning you occupy yourself; for the sake of those nobles... a light occupation as indicated by deleting the 'Ta' from 'Laha 'anhu' (distracted from him) like 'Radiya' (was content): when he was consoled, heedless, and left it. In expressing it this way is an indication that occupying oneself with those [nobles] has no benefit based on what the conjugations of the root imply, and that he who seeks the human and steps over people's necks to reach him has a great right upon you\" (1). Deleting the \"Ta\" from the form of \"Tafa''ul\" in the verb (Talahha) - He did not say (Tatalahha) - and advancing the prepositional phrase (from him - 'anhu') indicate dazzlingly that he, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not do that except with the one regarding whom he was admonished, and that he would not have done so were it not for his concern for what contained the Highest Good according to human estimations. The deletion of the \"Ta\" is a sign that this action is neither firmly established in him nor is he reckless in committing it. It is wondrous that the deletion was of a letter of meaning having prominence in its form; this suggests the verb losing the specific semantic characteristic of this form.

However, the Holy Qur'an portrayed this care for inviting those leaders in the image of amusement (Lahw) looking at its outcome, not looking at the state of its doer. This contains great dispraise and profound satire for those leaders, and a notification that any struggle with their likes in inviting them to Islam will not bear fruit and that its outcome is the outcome of amusement (Talahhi). When that word touched the hearing of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, his heart found rest from fear that he might be blamed for abandoning some struggle in his call. For a person to be admonished for excess in diligence and burdening the self beyond what it is commanded is more honorable than being admonished for negligence. The admonishment of the Holy Qur'an to the Prophet, peace be upon him and his family, never came regarding anything except what was by way of excess in diligence in the Call and excess mercy and kindness {There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful} (At-Tawbah: 128). *** Masculinity and Femininity in Arabic have principles necessitating their obligation, prohibition, or permissibility.

    "text": "Some scholars of rhetoric consider looking into masculinity and femininity as chapters of the 'Courage of Arabic' and a type of 'Iltifat' (Grammatical Shift), as is known to beginning students of knowledge from Ibn Jinni and after him Ibn al-Athir in 'Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir'. If the later rhetoricians of the Miftah school did not care much for this, it is not a sign of rhetoricians neglecting masculinity and femininity. The selected Masculinity and Femininity in the Qur'anic statement is apparent to every reciter, calling upon him to contemplate it, for beneath it are treasures of subtle meanings. You see that in the saying of Allah Almighty: {Then, is one against whom the word of punishment has come true [haqqa - masc.] - can you save one who is in the Fire?} (Az-Zumar: 19) and His saying Almighty (Az-Zumar: 71): The verb (Haqqa) came masculine despite being attributed to (Kalimah - Word) which is metaphorically feminine; Arabic allows both matters in it, and the predominant in general speech is the feminization of the verb attributed to it. He deviated in the verse from that frequent predominance for a matter proportionate to the context and intent. That is because \"when He Almighty singled out the glad tidings for the doers of good [from the beginning of His saying: For those who have done good... Those are the people of understanding (Verses 10-18)], it was known that others were judged with misery. And he, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, due to what he was naturally disposed to of great mercy and abundant compassion, was worthy of sorrow for those who turned away [{Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Muhammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow} (Al-Kahf: 6) and {Perhaps you would kill yourself through grief that they will not be believers} (Ash-Shu'ara: 3)...",

He caused by his sorrow for them: (Then is one against whom has come true [haqqa]) and He dropped the 'Ta' of feminization indicating softness to emphasize the prohibition of sorrow for them (the word of punishment) by his refusal and turning away, so he was because of that immersed in the Fire which We decreed as the recompense of the wicked; he cannot be saved from it\" (1). He points to the effect of the indication of feminization in portraying their lack of deserving sorrow for them, while the punishment has become true upon them, indeed they were in it. This portrayal fits the indication of Interrogation in (Afaman - Then is one who) and (Afa'anta - Can you), and advancing the pronoun (Anta - You) over the verbal predicate, and portraying them as being in the Fire even though they are alive (even if they are, in my view, in a moral fire eating their humanity and relationship with their Lord). All that is to emphasize His prohibition to him, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, regarding sorrow for them, that sorrow issuing from the heart of the Compassionate Merciful Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. So it was imperative to bring out all elements of the statement in a profoundly effective image, to correspond with the great sorrow for them from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. In this is increased praise for him for his compassion for his nation, even those who stubbornly opposed. *** And the statement came with the verb masculine while the subject is feminine plural, and the predominant is feminizing the verb with this subject, in the saying of Allah Almighty: {And do not be like those who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them [ja'ahum al-bayyinat]. And those will have a great punishment} (Al-Imran: 105). The verse came in the context of guiding the Ummah to hold fast to the Book of Allah Almighty, calling to good, enjoining right, and forbidding wrong so that success is realized for them.",

Al-Biqa'i clarifies for us the proportionality of the masculine verb (Ja'a) with the context and the good outcome the verses carry to the Ummah: \"...When He commanded them with that, He confirmed it by forbidding what opposes it, alluding to those regarding whom these verses were revealed from the People of the Book, rebuking them for their misguidance and difference in their religion against their prophets. So He said {And do not be like those who became divided...} by what they innovated in the principles of their religion, and by what they committed of sins... And since division might be physical only while agreeing in opinions, He clarified that the matter is not so, saying: {and differed...} by what bore for them the hatred carrying them to accept the state of one who is thought to be united while their hearts are divided. And when He dispraised them with difference which reason indicates is blameworthy, He increased in declaring its ugliness by [stating] that they differed in it after the prohibition of reason and clear transmission (Naql), saying: {after the clear proofs had come to them [min ba'di ma ja'ahum]} and He magnified it by stripping it of feminization {al-bayyinat - the clear proofs}...\" (1). In the masculinization of the verb (Ja'a) is great eloquence in portraying the People of the Book as unfit for anyone with an atom of reason and understanding to follow in their actions and opinions. For they opposed clear reason and authentic transmission. The coming of the statement to them was nothing but a strong, clear coming not obscured to anyone with eyes. Despite this, they differed and divided. So how can a Muslim take from these people an example in any matter of his religion, and leave what is in the guidance of the Book and Sunnah?",

Such people, after clarifying the matter to them in a way leaving no room for pause, are more deserving to be exiled from positions of guardianship and authority. *** This which Al-Biqa'i contemplated and perceived is most fitting for the rhetorical understanding of the verses of the Wise Reminder. He is, in such matters, superior to many of the predecessors, and those who came after him. The summary of speech in this is that Masculinity and Femininity in the Holy Qur'an contain an overflow of subtle meanings that draws insights to caring for contemplating it, and that scholars counting it among the chapters of the 'Courage of Arabic' is for one who understands what it contains of wondrous statement. *** Closely related to the Courage of Arabic in the Wise Reminder is singularizing what the apparent situation indicates should be plural, or pluralizing what the apparent situation indicates should be singular. That is deviating the statement from the apparent situation in coordination with the context and for the intent for which the speech is established. It is clear that Plural is what opposes Singular, so Dual enters into it because in Dual there is a gathering of two things, and the guidance of Prophethood is that two are a congregation (Jama'ah), and what we approve in prayer we approve in statement.

But the statement deviated from it to the singular to indicate that although they are multiple in Paradise, they are on a uniform path in purity, and to repel the suspicion that in their multiplicity they are tainted with what wives of this world are tainted with when multiple for a husband of bad character. So it indicated that in their multiplicity, they are upon the heart of a single wife; no deficiency and no variance. That is the peak of enjoyment. As if He removed from the multiplicity of wives in Paradise the corruption like He removed from wine in Paradise. Al-Biqa'i says: \"When He mentioned the dwelling which is the place of pleasure and followed it with food intended essentially, and the pleasure of the dwelling is not complete except with the intimacy of a neighbor, especially one enjoyed, He said (And they will have therein) meaning with that (spouses). And since they are of one character with no deficiency in it, He indicated it by unifying the adjective, and emphasized that by expressing with the form 'Taf'il' (Mutahharah) to inform that work was done on it, work of exaggeration such that there is no hope for increase, so He said (Mutahharah)...\" (1). Al-Biqa'i's view in singularizing (Mutahharah) is higher than the view of those saying that singular and plural here are two eloquent dialects (2), for this does not suffice in the rhetorical understanding of what the Holy Qur'an selected. And higher than the view that Singular is lighter than Plural, so if they combine they avoid heaviness by shifting to Singular (3), for such a view is critiqued by His saying Almighty: (Ayat Bayyinat - Clear Verses), (Al-Muhsanat Al-Mu'minat - Believing Chaste Women), (Fatayatikum Al-Mu'minat - Your Believing Girls), where it was linguistically valid to say (Al-Ayat Al-Bayyinah, Al-Muhsanat Al-Mu'minah, and Al-Fatayat Al-Mu'minah). *** And the singular of (Dar - Abode/Home) comes in the saying of Allah Almighty: {So the earthquake seized them, and they became within their home [dar] fallen prone} (Al-A'raf: 78, 91), and its plural (Diyar) in His saying Almighty: (Hud: 67) {And the shriek seized those who had wronged, and they became within their homes [diyar] fallen prone}.",

    "text": "And His saying Mighty and Majestic: {And the shriek seized those who had wronged, and they became within their homes [diyar] fallen prone} (Yunus: 94). Al-Biqa'i says: \"Perhaps singularizing 'Ad-Dar' here - i.e., in Al-A'raf - with the Earthquake (Rajfah) in the story of Salih and Shu'ayb peace be upon them in His saying (and they became within their home) meaning their dwellings, and pluralizing it in the two stories in Surah Hud peace be upon him is to indicate the magnitude of the earthquake and the shriek in the two places. That is because the earthquake, if it is in a single thing, is more firmly established, so it is greater in the intended exemplary punishment. And the shriek, its nature is spreading; so if it encompasses distant places and remote abodes, destroying their people, tearing apart their group, and scattering their unity, it is of excessive strength and extreme severity such that souls are disturbed by contemplating its description and hearts palpitate for it. The summary is that where He expressed with 'Rajfah' (Earthquake), He unified 'Ad-Dar' to indicate the severity of punishment by the greatness of the shaking. And where He expressed with 'Sayhah' (Shriek/Cry), He pluralized to imply the generality of death by the intensity of the sound. There is no contradiction; because their punishment was by both, and perhaps one was the cause for the other. Perhaps the intended meaning of 'Rajfah' is the agitation of hearts, an agitation that cut them, or that the abode shook, so the hearts shook, which is closer. 'Al-A'raf' was singled out with what was mentioned in it; because its objective is warning those who turn away, and the 'Rajfah' causes greater panic due to lack of familiarity with it (1). And he says in Surah Hud: \"The secret of expressing with 'Diyar' (plural) with the Shriek, and 'Dar' (singular) with the Earthquake in 'Al-A'raf' has preceded. 'Hud' was singled out with what was mentioned in it; because its objective is greater with regard to detailing, and both 'Diyar' and 'Sayhah' are closer to that\" (2). Al-Biqa'i looks in his interpretation and contemplation at the relationship of the effect to the affected (the place) and to the objective of the Surah: In Al-A'raf, the effect is the Earthquake, and when it is in a proximate place (Dar), it is greater and more severe in effect. This fits the Surah dedicated to Warning, as explicitly stated in its opening.",

    "text": "The Cry is an effect the nature of which is spreading, and spreading is a cause for weakening. So if it spread and yet destroyed, this indicates its great power. So the Plural (Diyar) was more indicative of its power. This spreading indicating the greatness of the effect is more suitable to the objective of Surah \"Hud\" which is Detailing, explicitly stated in its opening. It becomes clear to you that what \"Al-Biqa'i\" went to in explaining the proportionality between singularizing (Dar) and the statement using 'Rajfah' with the context in Surah \"Al-A'raf\" and its objective; and explaining the proportionality between pluralizing (Dar) and the statement using 'Sayhah' with the context in Surah (Hud) and its objective. You hardly find this with many of his predecessors - and I fear to say his successors - which confirms what he went to that \"due to the difference in objectives of Surahs, the orders of stories and their wordings change according to the style useful for indicating that objective\" (1) and \"that every Surah in which a story is repeated is for a meaning claimed in that Surah evidenced by that story other than the meaning for which it was driven in the previous Surah. From here the words differed according to those purposes, and the orders changed by delaying, advancing, brevity, and elongation, while nothing of that contradicts the original meaning by which the story was formed\" (2). *** Then comes the plural of paucity in the saying of Allah Almighty: {Indeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader, devoutly obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who associate others with Allah. * [He was] grateful for His favors [An'um]. He chose him and guided him to a straight path} (An-Nahl: 120-121).",

    "text": "Al-Biqa'i contemplates the face of proportionality in pluralizing the blessing as (An'um - few blessings) despite the fact that the blessings of Allah Almighty upon the Father of Prophets, our master Abraham peace be upon him, are very many and uncountable, saying: \"\"When He called them to noble morals and forbade them from bad ones by His acceptance of whoever turns to Him, even if his crime is great, answering the call of their father (Abraham) peace be upon him in His saying Mighty and Majestic: {So whoever follows me - then he is of me; and whoever disobeys me - indeed, You are [yet] Forgiving and Merciful} (Ibrahim: from Verse 36), He followed that by mentioning him to encourage following him in Tawhid and inclining with the Command and Prohibition in proceeding and refraining if they were of those who follow the truth or imitate the fathers. So He said by way of reasoning for what preceded {Indeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader, devoutly obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth}. And since the context is for establishing perfection for Abraham peace be upon him... AND HE WAS NOT OF THE POLYTHEISTS... GRATEFUL) and since Allah Mighty and Majestic has uncountable blessings upon one whom He made a leader (Ummah), He clarified that all of that is little beside His Bounty. So He said: indicating that with the plural of paucity, and that the thankful for the little gives thanks if the much comes to him by way of priority (for His favors [li-an'umihi]) (1).",

    "text": "The context of the verse - as Al-Biqa'i points out - is to urge the disbelievers to be truthful in correcting what they claimed of adopting a general rule they adhere to in their lives: their following the path of the fathers out of righteousness and obedience to them. So the Holy Qur'an clarified to them that the most rightful of fathers to be followed is the father of all Arabs and the highest of them: Abraham peace be upon him. And he was not of the polytheists in any face of polytheism, indicated by deleting the (Nun) from the present verb (Yaku - was). So what is wrong with them that they disobeyed him and opposed him by their polytheism and turning away from his law and method to the law and method of one who is lower than him and inferior? So the situation required reaching the limit in elevating the status of Abraham their father, peace be upon him, perhaps they would follow him in his Tawhid and gratitude to Allah Almighty. He is thankful for the few blessings, so how about him being thankful for the many? That is truly great as decreed by the indication of the concept of agreement (Mawafaqah) which is a way of expression in their clear Arabic tongue. In expressing his being thankful for His (few) favors over his being thankful for His (many) favors is a following of the path of alerting by the lower to the higher. ***** Al-Biqa'i, as you saw, is keen on looking into the indication of words and their significations upon it, whether hidden in them from their etymological family or existing in them from their form and compositional structure. The word for him has numerous tributaries in its indication of its rhetorical meaning. The summary is that although I elaborated on this feature more than others, I did not fulfill pointing, mere pointing, to a tenth of what enters into Al-Biqa'i's interpretation of the Holy Qur'anic statement.

    "text": "Those are some features of a methodology in interpreting the Holy Qur'anic statement. It is not hidden that I did not encompass all features related to his methodology in interpreting the Great Qur'anic statement directly, like his view on styles of simile, metaphor, metonymy, rhetorical embellishment, and other things. For I was not one to exhaust pointing to them, let alone exhaust explaining them. If I have left explaining what was of this nature, there are also other features of lower rank than what I mentioned. Of that is his care for some issues of Qur'anic Orthography (Rasm); he seeks to contemplate it in light of the context and intent, even if he does not do this frequently. Some forms of Qur'anic orthography are worthy of pausing at and contemplating, but he passes them. Among those features also is citing Prophetic Hadith while clarifying their sources, and pointing to what was weak among them sometimes. He cares for explaining Reasons for Revelation (Asbab al-Nuzul), and uses them to perceive the appropriateness of the verse to its context and the objective of its Surah, even in perceiving the understanding of the Compositional and Ordinal Order in the verse. Al-Biqa'i, in his referring to Reasons for Revelation, was not referring to them to take them as a cause for explaining the face of the verse's proportion in its location with its context, for this proportion has another face or faces. He says regarding the saying of Allah Almighty: {Allah does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths...} (Al-Ma'idah: from Verse 89) after interpreting the verse preceding it: \"And eat of what Allah has provided for you.\" He said: \"When - as Al-Baghawi and others reported from 'Ibn Abbas' may Allah be pleased with them - this verse was revealed, they said: O Messenger of Allah, how should we deal with our oaths that we swore? They had sworn on what they agreed upon (1).",

    "text": "As preceded, so Allah Almighty revealed: 'Allah does not impose blame upon you' meaning upon what belongs to Him of complete Majesty (for what is unintentional) which is what the tongue utters without intent (in your oaths). Note that I did not rely on the reason for revelation in the appropriateness except for its entry into the meaning, not for being a cause. For not every cause enters into appropriateness... The cause was here entering into the appropriateness of the Order; because prohibiting what is permitted is sometimes by vow and sometimes by oath. Vowing regarding the permissible - which is our issue - is not binding and its expiation is the expiation of an oath. Then, there was no need except to define oaths and their rulings. So He Almighty divided them into two parts: intended and unintended. As for the unintended, it has no consideration. As for the intended, it is two parts: swearing on a past, and swearing on a future. As for swearing on the past, it is the False Oath (Ghamus) which has no expiation according to some scholars... As for swearing on the future - which is where prohibition can occur - He mentioned its ruling here by His saying (But He imposes blame upon you) (1). *** Among the main features that \"Al-Biqa'i\" was keen on in his Tafsir is his quoting the essay of \"Abu Ja'far bin al-Zubair\" in his book \"Al-Burhan fi Tartib Suwar al-Qur'an\" (The Proof in the Arrangement of Quranic Surahs). He does this in all Surahs, and does not comment on what he quoted from him, as if he makes the speech of \"Ibn al-Zubair\" complementary to his speech or explaining another face of the faces of linking between Surahs. We are in need of someone to undertake a scientific study analyzing the methodology of \"Ibn al-Zubair\" in explaining the miraculousness of the rhetoric of Surah arrangement, and someone to undertake afterwards comparing his methodology in this with the methodology of \"Al-Biqa'i\", for that is something we are in dire need of. *** Likewise, Al-Biqa'i was keen on quoting chapters from the treatises of \"Abu al-Hasan al-Haralli\", almost including in his Tafsir those treatises which: \"Al-Haralli\" made regarding the principles of understanding the Holy Qur'an. These treatises are: Miftah al-Bab al-Muqfal fi Fahm al-Kitab al-Munazzal (Key to the Locked Door in Understanding the Revealed Book).
