    "text": "Chapter: The Verb with a Weak Initial Letter (*Mithal*)\n\nIf the initial letter is a Waw or Ya and it is Damma (u) or Kasra (i), you say: *Wu'ida* and *U'ida*, *Wuqita* and *Uqita*, and *Al-Wujuh* and *Al-Ajuh*, and *Al-Wuqud* and *Al-Aqud*, and *Al-Wisadah* and *Al-Isadah*, and *Al-Wishah* and *Al-Ishah*, by substituting [Hamza] for it. This is regular and undisputed when it is Damma. Sometimes Ta is substituted for Waw as well, as in *Tukhamah*. If it is Kasra, some grammarians follow the Arabs and do not substitute except what has been narrated from them of substitution. The Ya remains sound in its Kasra and Damma due to its lightness, so know this.\n\nYou say in the future tense (Mudari') of *Wa'ada*: *Ya'idu*, and the original is *Yaw'idu*, but since the Waw occurred between a Ya and a Kasra, it was deemed heavy and deleted for lightening. This rule does not apply to *Yu'adu* and *Yuqinu* and the like, so it is said: Why wasn't the Waw deleted from them despite occurring between a Ya and a Kasra? Or why didn't you keep it in *Ya'idu* and the like, and you would say: *Yu'idu*? Because the original in *Yu'adu* is *Yu'wadu*, because it is the future of *Aw'ada*, and *Aw'ada* is on the measure of *Dahraja*. Just as you say *Yudahriju* for the future tense, it follows to say *Yu'wadu*, but they deemed pronunciation with the Hamza heavy, so they deleted it for lightening, but it remains in intention, because the root of the word requires it. Since the matter is so, the Waw is as if it occurred between a Hamza and a Kasra, since the Hamza is in intention and a requirement of the word's structure. So it is not like *Ya'idu*, nor does what we mentioned apply to it. For *Ta'idu* (you promise), the Waw has been dropped, even though it did not occur between a Ya and a Kasra, because they disliked the Waw remaining in some forms of the future tense of the word and being deleted in others. This is one of the cases where weak letter rules (*I'lal*) were followed for the sake of consistency and continuity.\n\nYou say in the imperative: *'Id*, and the original is: *Iw'id*, because the imperative is built upon the future tense, as it is a construction for what has not happened, just as the future is a construction for what has not happened. However, when the Waw occurred between two Kasras, it became in its ruling like when it occurred between a Ya and a Kasra, so they deleted it for lightening, becoming *I'id*. Then the Hamza brought [for pronunciation] was dispensed with due to the movement of what followed it, becoming *'Id*. That is because the Hamza is only brought in the construction of the imperative if its beginning is silent (*sukun*), because the present imperative is built upon the future, and the prefix of the present tense (*Mudar'ah*) is deleted from its beginning. If the first letter after it is silent, something is needed to enable pronunciation, so the Alif is brought for that. Therefore, the triliteral verb all has Hamzat al-Wasl at the beginning of its imperative construction, while it is dispensed with in the quadriliteral like *Dahraja* and *Harwala*. You say in the imperative of them: *Dahrij* and *Harwil*, because when you deleted the prefix of the present tense, what followed it was voweled, so you dispensed with the first [Hamza]. Then most of what was built from the triliteral with an addition followed a course in pronouncing Hamzat al-Wasl at its beginning in the imperative, such as: *Intalaqa*, *Istakhraja*, *Iqtatalu*, and the like.\n\nIf you build [the imperative], you say: *'Id*. If you make it plural, you say: *'Idu*. If you command a female, you say: *'Idi*. For two females: *'Ida*. For plural females: *'Idna*. The cause in all of that is like the cause in *'Id*.\n\nAs for its source (*Masdar*): *Al-Wa'd*, *Al-Maw'id*, and the defective *'Idah*, because the original in it is: *Wi'dah*. When the Waw was in the verb, it became weak and fell. It is a rule of the Masdar to be built on *Fi'lah* in its soundness and defectiveness. Since the Kasra on the Waw was deemed heavy, the Waw was deleted as it was deleted in the verb. If its verb were a noun and not a Masdar, it would have remained sound due to the distance of the noun from the verb, and the closeness of the Masdar to it regarding that. For every direction [there is a justification], and their saying: *Wildah* (birth/children), so know it.\n\nThe active participle (*Ism Faa'il*) is *Wa'idun*. If you pluralize it, you say: *Awa'idu*, which is *Fawa'il*, so you substituted as you substituted in its diminutive when you said: *Uway'id*, which is *Fuway'il*, to avoid repetition of Waw, and because broken plural follows the course of diminution. The substitution occurred in the diminutive due to the meeting of two voweled Waws, and the first is Damma, so it is as if three Waws met.\n\nThe passive participle (*Ism Maf'ul*) is *Maw'ud*. The passive verb is *Wu'ida* for the past, and *Yu'adu* for the future, and the Waw remained sound as you saw. If you wish, you can substitute a Hamza for it, and that has passed.\n\nIf the initial letter is a Ya, like *Yasara*, it remains sound in the future tense. You say: *Yasara Yaysiru Yasran* so he is *Yasir*, *Yana'a al-Thamar* (the fruit ripened), and *Ya'ara al-Jady* (the kid bleated). That remains sound in its Masdar, the imperative from it, and the active participle. In the plural, you say: *Al-Yusr*, *Aysur*, *Yassir*, and *Yawassir*. The Ya is not treated like the Waw due to its lightness and the prevalence of Waw transformation. I have said that Alif is only an addition or a transformation in the verb, and if that is so, it does not occur in the position of the initial letter (*Fa*) of the verb, so know it.",

    "text": "As for *Fa'ila* with Kasra on the 'Ayn of the weak verb, it remains sound. You say: *Wajila Yawjalu*, because the Waw did not occur between a Ya and a Kasra, since its future is *Yaf'alu*. The imperative is *Iwjal*, and it is said: *Iyjal*. This is just as they said in the future *Yajal*. It is a rule of *Fa'ila* that some Arabs put Kasra on the prefixes of the present tense in it, just as they do in what exceeds three letters, except for Ya alone. They say: *Anta Ti'lamu*, *Ana I'lamu*, *Nahnu Ni'lamu*, and likewise *Nista'inu*, *Tis'ina*, and *Ista'in*. As for the Ya, they do not put Kasra on it because the heaviness of Kasra on it is evident. It has been narrated regarding weak verbs that they say: *Yayjalu*. Al-Akhfash said: When they transformed the Waw into Ya with Nun, Ta, and Alif being broken: *Tijalu*, *Nijalu*, and *Ijalu*, they avoided returning the Waw with the Ya, so they bore the heaviness of Kasra on the Ya and spoke with it so that the construction of the present tense would not differ in their dialect.\n\nAs for what has a Ya as its initial letter from this structure, like *Ya'isa Yai'asu*, if the Waw in it remains sound, then the Ya is more deserving due to its lightness as I mentioned. As for *Yalighu*, it is the future of *Walagha*, and it seems it came originally on *Yaf'ilu* with Kasra on the 'Ayn, as if it was *Yawlighu*, so the Waw occurred between a Ya and a Kasra and was deleted for heaviness. Then they reverted from *Yalighu* to *Yalaghu* because of the guttural letter, which is the Ghayn. Similar to that are *Yata'u*, *Yasa'u*, and *Yada'u*. As for *Yadharu*, it is the future of *Wadhara*, so it is carried upon *Yada'u* just as a thing is carried upon its counterpart. What deviated in this chapter and came with Kasra on the 'Ayn in the future is *Waliya Yali*, *Wamiqa* [Yamiqu], *Wariya al-Zandu Yari*, and other letters. This is just as it came in the sound verb: *Hasiba Yahsibu*, *Na'ima Yan'imu*, *Ya'isa Yai'asu*, and *Yabisa Yaybisu*, so know it.\n\nAs for the verb with Hamza (Mahmuz) like *Ata*, it remains sound because Hamza is a strong letter. You say in the future: *Ya'ti*, and the imperative *I'ti*. This is not among what has a weak initial letter in anything. As for *Khudh* (Take), *Kul* (Eat), and *Mur* (Command), these three letters had their initial deleted for lightening. Sibawayh said: They only deviated due to frequent usage. Other verbs starting with Hamza do not have it deleted in the imperative. The Hamza was returned in *Mur* specifically with the conjunction particle, Allah Almighty said: (And enjoin prayer upon your family), and it was not returned in *Khudh* and *Kul*. As for Sibawayh, he claimed that returning it with Waw after the continuity of deletion is a second anomaly. Al-Mazini gave a reason for this place, mentioning that returning the Hamza was due to the weakness of Mim and Ra. That is because the Mim, due to the Ghunnah (nasal sound) in it, resembled the Nun, and the Nun is likened to letters of Madd and Lin. He said: And the Ra in its articulation has repetition (*Takrar*), so the tongue does not settle when pronouncing it as it settles with strong letters. He said: When the two letters were weak, they mandated returning the Hamza with the conjunction particle in some of its conjugations.\n\nChapter: The Hollow Verb (*Mu'tall al-'Ayn*)\n\nKnow that *Fa'ala* from this chapter with Fatha on the 'Ayn is equal in its pronunciation and the pronunciation of *Fa'ila* with Kasra on the 'Ayn, whether from Waw or Ya, because by their movement and the Fatha before them they turn into Alif. That is like: *Qala* (said), *Thaba* (returned), *Sara* (walked), *Nama* (slept), *Haba* (feared), and *Sara* (became). The original is: *Qawala*, *Thawaba*, *Sayara*, *Baya'a* with Fatha on Waw and Ya, and *Nawima*, *Khawifa*, *Hayiba*, *Sayira* with Kasra on Waw and Ya. Since the weak letters in all of them moved and what was before them was open, they turned into Alif for it. The future: *Yaqulu*, *Yathubu*, *Yasiru*, *Yabi'u*, *Yanamu*, and *Yakhafu*. The original in them is: *Yaqwulu*, *Yathwubu*, *Yasyiru*, *Yabyi'u*, *Yanwamu*, and *Yakhwafu*. The vowel of the weak letter was shifted to what was before it, so it turned—if it was Fatha—into Alif, and remained—if it was Damma or Kasra—Waw and Ya. This was only made weak following the past tense, because they disliked that the past be weak and the future sound. We only said this because what is before the weak letter was silent, and were it not for the weakness of its past, it would have remained sound. This and its likes are called \"weakness of following\" (*I'lal al-Itba'*). For this reason, the Masdar remained sound, so they said: *Qawlan*, *Sayran*, and *Nawman*, as there did not occur in it what necessitated weakness when the weak letter is silent and what is before it is open. As for *Hawila* and *'Awira*, they remained sound because they are defective *Ihwalla* and *I'warra*, evidenced by the structures of their counterparts. Just as they remained sound, the active participle from them remained sound. You say: He is *Hawilun* and *'Awirun*, so know it.",

    "text": "They established that [the form] 'Fa'ula' belongs to the roots with 'Waw', and its imperfect (future) tense only comes as 'Yaf'ulu'. Those from roots with 'Ya' only come as 'Yaf'ilu', so that the two categories do not differ and one does not enter the likeness of the other through weak-letter alteration (I'lal). As for 'Fa'ila' with a kasra on the middle radical ('Ayn), its imperfect is necessarily 'Yaf'alu' for both [Waw and Ya roots], because its counterpart in sound verbs is like that, such as: 'Hadhira/Yahdharu' (to be cautious) and 'Alima/Ya'lamu' (to know). The imperative of 'Saying' (Al-Qawl) is 'Qul' (Say), because its imperfect is 'Yaqulu'. The original form was 'Iqwul', so the vowel of the Waw was transferred to the Qaf, as done in the imperfect. Then two quiescent letters met: the Waw and the Lam, so the Waw was deleted. The imperative of 'Walking' (Al-Sayr): They said 'Sir' (Walk). The original was 'Isyir'. The vowel of the Ya was transferred to the Sin as they did in the imperfect, then the Ya was deleted due to the meeting of two quiescent letters, and the Hamza [of the imperative] was dropped as it was no longer needed. Similarly, the imperative of 'Sleeping' (Al-Nawm) is 'Nam' (Sleep). Originally 'Inwam'; the vowel of the Waw was transferred to the Nun, then it was deleted due to the meeting of two quiescent letters, and the Hamza was dispensed with. The counterparts of these three structures in the imperative follow what we have described. The proof that the weak letters in these structures were deleted due to the meeting of two quiescent letters after transferring their vowels to the preceding letter is that they return if the final radical (Lam) of the verb is vowelized. You say: 'Qula' (you two say), 'Sira' (you two walk), and 'Nama' (you two sleep). And in the plural: 'Qulu', 'Siru', and 'Namu'. In the feminine singular: 'Siri', 'Quli', and 'Nami'. In the feminine plural, when the final radical becomes quiescent again, the weak letter is deleted. You say: 'Qulna', 'Sirna', and 'Nimna, O women'. The weak-letter alteration in these is as we mentioned before. If the form is 'Fa'altu' with a fatha on the 'Ayn, it is transformed in Waw-roots to 'Fu'ultu' and in Ya-roots to 'Fi'iltu' so that the vowel of their middle radical can be transferred to their first radical. You say: 'Qultu' (I said) and 'Bi'tu' (I sold). The originals were 'Qawaltu' and 'Baya'tu'. They were returned to 'Quwiltu' and 'Buyi'tu' [hypothetical intermediate steps], then the vowels of the Waw and Ya were transferred to what preceded them. Two quiescent letters gathered in each, so the first was deleted due to their gathering. If it was 'Fa'iltu' with a kasra on the 'Ayn, it needs a change, like 'Hibtu' (I feared/respected) and 'Khiftu' (I feared). Just as 'Fa'ultu' with a damma on the 'Ayn does not need a change, like 'Tulta' (You became tall) -> 'Tatulu' -> 'Fa-anta Tawil' (You are tall). The originals were 'Hayibtu' and 'Khawiftu'; the vowels of the Waw and Ya were transferred to the preceding letter, two quiescent letters met, and the first was deleted. If you form the passive voice (what has not been named its doer) from this category, its wording is uniform. You say: 'Qila' (It was said), 'Bi'a' (It was sold), and 'Khifa' (It was feared). The originals were 'Quwila', 'Buyi'a', and 'Khuwifa'. The vowels of the Waw and Ya were transferred to the preceding letter. The Waw turned into a Ya due to the kasra before it, becoming: 'Qila', 'Bi'a', and 'Khifa'. If you make the verb transitive to yourself [as the object], it takes the form of the active voice informing about you. You say: 'Khiftu' (I was feared - meaning someone feared me), 'Bi'tu' (I was sold), and 'Hibtu' (I was respected). Meaning: Others feared me, respected me, or sold me. The originals were 'Khuwiftu' and 'Buyi'tu'. The vowels of the Waw and Ya were transferred to the preceding letter, two quiescent letters gathered, so the Waw and Ya were deleted, becoming 'Bi'tu' and 'Khiftu'. Some Arabs say 'Bu'a al-shay'' (The thing was sold) and 'Qula al-qawl' (The statement was said), and some use 'Ishmam' (a flavor of formatting the lips), but the kasra in the first is better. Know this. Also know that if a Hamza occurred in the place of a weak letter, it would remain sound, except for what they agreed to delete in 'Ra'aytu' (I saw). Therefore, they agreed on 'Bariyya' (creation), 'Rawiyya' (reflection), and 'Al-Nabi' (The Prophet) and 'Quraysh'; there is no Hamza in their speech [for these words]. This is what was narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that someone addressed him saying 'Ya Nabi' Allah' (O Prophet of God) pronouncing the Hamza. He replied: 'I am not the Nabi' of Allah; I am the Nabi of Allah.' All grammarians agree this is derived from 'Naba'' which is 'News'. Some linguists held that it is not impossible for it to be from 'Nubuwwa' which is 'Elevation', as if he was given the highest ranks when charged with delivering the message. As for 'Rawiyya', there is no disagreement it is from 'Ra'awtu'. 'Bariyya', some make it from 'Bara' which is dust, but most say it is from 'Bara'tu', meaning 'I created'. When you say 'Ra'aytu' (I saw), its imperfect is 'Yara'. The original is 'Yar'a'. The Hamza was deleted for lightness, and its vowel was thrown onto the Ra, becoming 'Yara'. Then the imperative is based on the imperfect. Because of the deletion occurring in it and its consistency in the rule of weak-letter alteration, you say when commanding: 'Ra hadha' (See this). It is from the pattern 'If'al'. The original is 'Ir'a' like 'Is'a'. The Hamza was deleted, its vowel thrown to the Ra, then the initial connective Hamza was dispensed with due to the movement of the Ra, becoming 'Ra'. If you paused on it, you would say 'Rah'. The 'Ha' was added because a single letter cannot be started and stopped upon. If you make it dual, you say 'Raya'. The original is 'Ir'aya'. In plural 'Raw'. Original 'Ir'ayu'. When the Hamza was deleted and its vowel moved to the Ra, the Ya turned into an Alif due to its movement and the fatha before it. Then the Alif was deleted due to the meeting of two quiescent letters, becoming 'Raw', because the Hamza was deleted from its beginning as it was unneeded. In feminine, you say 'Ray'. Original 'Ir'ayi'. In dual feminine 'Raya', and in plural women 'Rayna'. The cause in all of them follows what was mentioned previously.",

    "text": "Know that the active participle (Ism al-Fa'il) from this chapter undergoes alteration (I'lal); its Ya or Waw is replaced by a Hamza. You say from 'Qala': 'Qa'il' (sayer), and from 'Sara': 'Sa'ir' (walker/traveler). The originals are 'Qawil' and 'Sayir'. Since the active participle is built upon the verb, and the Waw and Ya were weak in the verb, and they occurred in the active participle with a Kasra after an Alif, they were also altered due to the heaviness of the Kasra upon them, and because of their weakness in the verb on which the active participle is based. When they moved and the letter before them was open (Fatha), a Hamza was substituted for them due to the similarity of Hamza to the Alif preceding them. If you form the passive participle (Ism al-Maf'ul) from Waw-roots, you say for 'Qala': 'Maqul' (said), and for 'Sara ilayhi': 'Masur ilayhi' (traveled to). The original is 'Maqwul'. The vowel of the Waw was transferred to the Qaf, so two quiescent letters met—the two Waws. The Waw of the Maf'ul form was deleted according to Sibawayh, or the original root Waw according to Al-Akhfash, becoming 'Maqul'. No sound form came from Waw-roots in the Maf'ul pattern except two words: 'Thawb Maswun' (preserved garment)—Ism Maf'ul from 'Sana Yasunu', while the analogy is 'Masun', which is the commonly used one; and 'Misk Madwuf' (mixed musk)—from 'Dafa Yadufu', while the analogy is 'Maduf', which is commonly used. Al-Kisa'i related these two. You say regarding Ya-roots: 'Kiltuhu fahuwa Makil' (I measured it, so it is measured), and 'Bi'tuhu fahuwa Mabi'' (I sold it, so it is sold). The originals are 'Makyuul' and 'Mabyu'c'. The vowel of the Ya was transferred to what preceded it. Two quiescent letters met, and there is a difference of opinion here. Some say: The Waw of Maf'ul was deleted, then the Kaf and the Ba were given a Kasra to suit the Ya, becoming 'Makil' and 'Mabi''. Others say: The last radical of the verb (the Ya) was deleted, then the Waw of Maf'ul was changed to a Ya so that the Waw-form would not be confused with the Ya-form, and the letter before the Ya was given a Kasra after the substitution to suit the Ya, becoming 'Makil'. They completed the Ya-forms specifically, saying: 'Thawb Makhyut' (sewn garment) and 'Burr Makyul' (measured wheat). It is said: 'Ghubina al-rajul fahuwa Maghbun' (The man was cheated, so he is cheated), and 'I think you are a Sayyid Ma'yun' (affected by the evil eye). This is due to the lightness of the Ya. This also applies to verbs on the pattern 'Fa'ila' if they are from Waw-roots like 'Khafa' (he feared) and similar ones; you say: 'Huwa Makhuf' (He is feared); know this. Know that 'Sa'a/Yasu'u' (to be bad), 'Na'a/Yanu'u' (to weigh down), are like 'Qama/Yaqumu' and 'Ada/Ya'udu'. And 'Fa'a/Yafi'u' (to return), 'Ja'a/Yaji'u' (to come) are like 'Sara/Yasiru' and 'Ba'a/Yabi'u'. 'Sha'a/Yasha'u' (to will) is like 'Khafa/Yakhafu' in all their rules, except for the active participle, where two Hamzas would meet, so the second is turned into a Ya due to the heaviness of their meeting. You say: 'Huwa Ja'in', 'Sha'in', and 'Fa'in' (He is coming, willing, returning). Al-Khalil used to say about this: It is inverted (Maqlub). The methods are of two types. Chapter: What has a weak final radical (Lam). Know that if Waw and Ya are final radicals and are vowelized, and the letter before them is open (Fatha), they are turned into Alif, unless the structure of the word is disrupted by the change or one form enters into another. Examples: 'Sara', 'Ghaza', 'Sa'a'. One says: 'Ghaza Yaghzu' (He raided/raids). The original in its imperfect is 'Yaghzuwu'. The Damma was heavy on the Waw while preceded by a Damma, so they made it quiescent, becoming 'Yaghzu'. Or from 'Al-Sura': 'Yasri'. Original 'Yasriyu'. And from 'Al-Sa'y': 'Sa'a Yas'a'. This follows 'Fa'ala Yaf'alu'. Original 'Yas'ayu'; the Ya was turned into Alif due to its movement and the Fatha before it. Know that the imperfect of Waw-roots which are on the pattern 'Fa'ala' (Fatha on 'Ayn) is 'Yaf'ulu' (Damma), and from Ya-roots is 'Yaf'ilu' (Kasra), according to the rule of hollow verbs (weak middle). 'Fa'ila' (Kasra on 'Ayn) applies to both, like 'Shaqiya' (to be miserable) and 'Ghaniya' (to be rich), from 'Shaqwa' and 'Ghunya'. As for 'Fa'ula' (Damma on 'Ayn), it is specific to Waw-roots like 'Saruwa/Yasru' (to be manly/noble) and 'Sakhuwa/Yaskhu' (to be generous). It does not occur in Ya-roots to avoid ending up with something heavy due to the alteration that would be necessary. Similarly, in the previous chapter, this pattern was specific to Waw-roots, like 'Tala fahuwa Tawil'. As for the first chapter [Fa'ula], examples came for both, like 'Wajuza fahuwa Wajiz' (brief) and 'Yasura fahuwa Yasir' (easy). This form is never transitive according to our companions. Similarly, when you say: 'Hum Yaghzun' (They raid) and 'Yarmun' (They throw), and 'Anti Taghzin' and 'Tarmin' (You fem. raid/throw). The originals: 'Taghzuwun', 'Yarmiyun', 'Tarmiyin', 'Taghzuwin'. The cause is one: The Damma was heavy on the Waw and Ya when preceded by Damma or Kasra, so they removed it. Two quiescent letters met, so the Waw and Ya were deleted, becoming: 'Hum Yaghzun, Yarmun' and 'Anti Taghzin, Tarmin'. Then the imperative is built in all cases on its imperfect. One says from 'Ghazu' if commanding a man: 'Ughzu' (Raid), just as one says in sound verbs: 'Ub'ud'. The connective Alif was designated with Damma due to the Damma of the 'Ayn [of the verb]. This is because they disliked breaking (Kasra) and then ascending to a Damma in the formation. My saying 'in the formation' is a precaution against cases where one of the vowels is grammatical (I'rab) or brought about by the meeting of two quiescent letters, like your saying: 'Fa-khudhuhu 'adudan' or 'Quli al-haqqa'. Do you not see that you ascended in these places from Kasra to Damma or Damma to Kasra? They did not count it as heaviness because the grammatical vowel is not fixed, nor is the vowel for meeting quiescent letters. Due to their dislike of what I mentioned, there is no 'Fu'ila' nor 'Fi'ula' in the language.",

    "text": "The passive form construction like 'Duriba' (It was struck) does not fall under what we have said, because they intentionally made it a unique form without a counterpart, to distinguish between the [active] verb, which informs about the doer, and it, which informs about the object. As for 'Du'il', which is the name of a small beast, it is a single anomalous word that is disputed; thus, it is judged as non-existent due to its anomaly and the disagreement regarding it. If it is said: Why did they dislike 'If'ila' but not find 'If'ula' heavy? I say: The Hamza was opened in the form of the predicate (active voice), and the Kasra is heavy as I mentioned, so nothing remained but the Damma. It is as if when it was met by another Damma, and their substance was of one type, it was lighter for them. Based on this is the chapter of Imala and bringing a letter closer to another. If you use the dual, you say: 'Ughzuwa'. This is 'If'alu'. The Damma was heavy [on the Waw] while preceded by Damma, so they made it quiescent. Two quiescent letters met, so the first Waw was deleted due to the meeting of two quiescent letters. It was more deserving of deletion because the second is the Waw of the pronoun. If it were deleted, the verb would return to the singular form. When the final radical (Lam) is deleted, the remaining structure of the word indicates it. You say to a woman: 'Ughzi'. This is 'If'ali'. The original is 'Ughzuwi'. To two women: 'Ughzuwa'. To a group of women: 'Ughzuna'. This is 'If'ulna' according to its original. If you command from 'Sura' (night travel), you say: 'Isri'. Dual: 'Isriya'. Plural: 'Isru'. This is from 'If'ilu'. Original: 'Israyu'. To a woman: 'Isri'. This is 'If'ili'. Original: 'Israyi'. The deleted one is the first Ya because it was altered, as the second is for the pronoun. Dual: 'Isriya'. Plural women: 'Isrina'. This is 'If'ilna' according to its original. If you command from 'Sa'y' (striving), you say: 'Is'a'. Dual: 'Is'aya'. Plural: 'Is'aw'. Original: 'Is'ayu'. The Ya was turned into Alif due to its movement and the Fatha before it. Two quiescent letters met, so the Alif was deleted due to their meeting. The Alif was more deserving of deletion because the Waw is for the pronoun. If it is said: Why did you not add Damma to the 'Ayn (middle radical) to suit the Waw when the Alif was removed? I say: The Fatha could not be dropped because it indicates the [deleted] Alif. To a woman you say: 'Is'ay'. This is 'If'ali'. Original: 'Is'ayi'. Dual: 'Is'aya'. Plural women: 'Is'ayna'. This is 'If'alna' according to its original. Know that the Damma is heavy on the Waw and Ya as they are weak letters. Therefore, the imperfect of this category in the nominative case has a quiescent ending, like 'Yaghzu' and 'Yarmi'. The Fatha is light, so it takes the inflection in the accusative. You say: 'Lan Yaghzuwa' and 'Lan Yajriya'. The active participle in this category follows this rule. The proof that they find the Damma and Kasra heavy in themselves is that they say for 'Adud': 'A'dd', and for 'Kabid': 'Kabd', making the middle quiescent, but they do not say for 'Jamal': 'Jaml'. If you inform about a woman in this category, you say: 'Ghazat' and 'Ramat'. The final radical of the verb was deleted due to its quiescence and the quiescence of the [feminine] Ta entering upon it. If you use the dual, you do not return the speech [to original], you say: 'Ghazata' and 'Ramata', because the Ta, even if vowelized, does not have a permanent vowel as it only occurred due to the quiescence of the Alif [of the dual]. What follows the pattern 'Fa'ila Yaf'alu' like 'Jariya Yajri' (to run) and 'Shajiya Yashja' (to choke/grieve), the speech regarding it is like the speech regarding 'Sa'a Yas'a', because they share the 'Yaf'alu' pattern. The cause for all that we did not mention is like what preceded, so there is no need to repeat it; know it. Know that the active participle in this category is weak in the nominative and genitive cases just as the verb was weak. One says for 'Yasri': 'Huwa Sarin', and for 'Ghaza': 'Huwa Ghazin'. The originals: 'Ghaziwun' and 'Sariyun'. The Damma was heavy on the Waw and Ya while preceded by Kasra, so they were made quiescent. The two quiescent letters—the Tanween and the Ya—met, so the Ya was deleted due to the meeting of the quiescent Tanween and Ya. Whenever the Tanween falls, the Ya returns. You say: 'Huwa Al-Sari' and 'Al-Ghazi'. If you pause on 'Ghazin', you say: 'Hadha Ghazin', because the Tanween is intended, so the Ya is not established to avoid the meeting of two quiescent letters. If you pause on 'Al-Ghazi', you establish the Ya because there is no Tanween. Some Arabs delete the Ya here as well. There is no disagreement regarding its establishment during annexation (Idafa), and likewise in the plural of women; you say: 'Ghawazin' and 'Sawarin'. This is because the Tanween, when it entered as a substitute for its inflection—since this form is diptote (does not accept full declension) being on the weight of 'Masajid' and the like—it was treated like the singular. Therefore, the Ya is deleted in writing from them.",

    "text": "Some of our companions say: The Ya from this plural is necessarily deleted as a realization [of rule], not analogy. When it falls, the Tanween returns due to the deficiency of the structure preventing it from being diptote. In the accusative state, the Ya is established in all cases. You say: 'Ra'aytu Qadiyan' and 'Ghawaziya', because the Fatha is light. When the inflection entered in the place of the accusative in 'Ghawazin', it prevented the Tanween (diptote status) as required. You say for the passive participle from Waw-roots: 'Maghzuwwun' according to its original rule, and from Ya-roots: 'Marmiyyun'. The original is 'Marmuwyun'. Since the Ya and Waw met and the first was quiescent, the Waw was changed to a Ya and then assimilated (Idgham) due to the Kasra before it. You say: 'Ghuziya' and 'Wu'iya'. Original: 'Ghuziwa'. In dual: 'Ghuziya'. In plural: 'Ghuzu'. Original: 'Ghuziyu'. Similarly, you say for Ramya: 'Rumu'. Original: 'Rumiyu'. The Damma was heavy on the Ya while preceded by Kasra, so they made it quiescent. Two quiescent letters met, so the Ya was deleted, then the Mim and Ra were given a Damma to suit the Waw, becoming 'Rumu' and 'Ghuzu'. Chapter: What has a weak first and last radical. Know that the beginning of this chapter follows the rules of weak-first radical, and its end follows weak-last radical. Examples: 'Washa Yashi' (to embroider/tattle), 'Wafa Yafi' (to fulfill), 'Wa'a Ya'i' (to memorize/contain). The first radical is weak in the imperfect and imperative because the weak letter falls in it exactly as it falls in 'Wa'ada Ya'idu'. The last radical is weak in them because the weak letter falls in the position it holds in 'Jara', 'Sa'a', and 'Ghaza'. So you say in the imperfect of 'Washa' and 'Wa'a': 'Yashi' and 'Ya'i'. Original: 'Yawshi' and 'Yaw'i'. When the Waw fell between a Ya and a Kasra, it was deleted. You say in the imperative: ''I ya hadha' (Memorize/Listen, O man) and 'Shi thawbaka' (Embroider your garment). Original: 'Iw'i' and 'Iwshi'. When the Waw fell between two Kasras, it was deleted, then the Hamza brought [for pronunciation] was dispensed with. If you pause on it, you say: ''Ih' and 'Shih'. The Ha (Sakt) was returned because they start with a moving letter and pause on a quiescent one, and this is not possible in a single letter. If you use the dual, you say: 'Shiya' and ''Iya'. In plural: 'Shu athwabakum' and ''U hadithana'. Allah the Almighty said: 'O you who believe, Qu anfusakum' (Save yourselves). The original is 'Iwqiyu' on the pattern 'If'alu'. The Waw was dropped as mentioned before, leaving 'Iqyuh'. The Damma was heavy on the Ya while preceded by Kasra, so they removed it. Two quiescent letters met—the Ya and the Waw. The Ya was deleted due to the meeting of two quiescent letters. Then the Qaf was given a Damma to suit the Waw. The Hamza brought was dispensed with due to the movement of the following letter, so it was deleted, becoming 'Qu' and ''U'. Know that what follows 'Fa'ila' like 'Waliya' (to be near/govern) and 'Wariya al-zand Yari' (the fire-stick struck fire) -- since its imperfect came as 'Yaf'ilu', the imperative form became like what we mentioned in 'Waqa' and 'Wa'a'. So you say in the imperative: 'Li baladana ya rajul' (Govern our land, O man), and 'Ri naran ya zand' (Strike fire, O stick). If this had come on the original pattern of the chapter which is 'Yaf'alu' with Fatha on the 'Ayn, the imperative would have been 'Iwla' and 'Iwri', because its first radical would have been sound in the imperfect just as it is sound in 'Wajila Yawjalu'. But since it came as 'Yaf'ilu' with Kasra on the 'Ayn, the imperative followed what we mentioned. If you command a female from 'Wa'a' and 'Washa', you say: ''I' and 'Shi'. Original: 'Iw'iyi' and 'Iwshiyi'. The Waw was dropped as mentioned. Then the Ya was heavy while preceded by Kasra, so it was made quiescent and deleted due to meeting of two quiescent letters. In dual: 'Qiya' and ''Iya'—masculine and feminine are the same, just as they are in other chapters. In plural women: ''Ina' and 'Shina'. Original: 'I'ina' and 'Ishina' on the pattern 'If'alna'. The first radical of the verb fell as mentioned, and likewise the introduced Hamza. Section containing examples from these four chapters whose rules we detailed, and the discussion thereof is so the observer may become familiar with what precedes by recalling what passed. Know that 'Ifta'ala' from the chapter of weak-first radical appears assimilated (Idgham), and this is the chosen mode. Examples: 'Itta'ada', 'It-tahaba', 'It-tazana', 'It-ta'asa', 'It-tabasa'. Meaning of 'Ittahaba': Accepted the gift. 'Itta'ada': Committed to the promise and accepted it. 'Ittazana': Accepted the weight. 'Itta'asa' from 'Ya's' (despair). 'Ittabasa' from 'Yabs' (dryness). Originals: 'Iwta'ada', 'Iwtazana', 'Iwta haba', 'Iyta'asa', 'Iytabasa'. The Waw and Ya were changed to Ta, then the first was assimilated into the second. If they left them on their original, they would follow what precedes them. Some Arabs leave it on the original. Assimilation between Waw and Ta was suitable due to the closeness of the two letters and their similarity in being from the augmentative and substitution letters. Do you not see you say 'Tukhama' (indigestion), original 'Wukhama'; 'Tuk'a' (prop), original 'Wik'a'. You say 'Taqi Yattaqi', original 'Waqa Yaqi'. You say 'It-taka'tuhu', original 'Awka'tuhu'. They are close in their point of articulation. Do you not see that the Ta is from the tip of the tongue and the tip of the upper incisors, and there is no origin for a letter after it except the lip, from which comes the Waw? Since they were similar in these aspects, assimilation was sought in them due to their meeting.",

    "text": "The active participle (*Ism Fa'il*) and the verbal noun (*Masdar*) are built upon the verb, so you say: *Mutt'id* (promiser/accepting promise), and *Muttazin* (weigher/accepting weight), and between them is *Itti'ad* and *Ittizan*. Whenever the verb is transitive, the passive participle (*Ism Maf'ul*) follows that as well, except that it differs from the active participle by the opening of the [letter before the] Ha' in it [referring to the pattern]. So you say: It is *Muttahab lahu* (given), since it is valid to say: *Ittahabtuhu* (I accepted it as a gift).\nKnow that the noun of place and the verbal noun formed with the addition of Mim are in this chapter on the pattern *Maf'il*, like: *Maw'id* (appointment/place of promise), *Mawdiq* (place of destruction/perishing), *Mawzin* (weighing place), *Mawrid* (watering place), and *Mawdi'* (place). Except for letters that deviated, like *Mawhab* (place of gift) as a proper name with Fatha on the Ha', while it is the Masdar of *Wahaba*. Evidence that the original in it is *Maf'il* with Kasra on the 'Ayn is your saying: *Mawhibatu Allah hasanah* (Allah's gift is good). And *Mawhad*, if you say: The people came *Mawhad Mawhad* (one by one), just as you say: The people came *Uhad Uhad*. And *Mawkal*, a place name. The analogy in it was to say: *Mawhid*, *Mawhib*, and *Mawkil*.\nAs for the hollow verb (*Mu'tall al-'Ayn*), the Masdar is on *Maf'al*, with open 'Ayn, and it becomes weak as its verb became weak, like: *Al-Maqal* (speech), *Al-Mazar* (visiting place), *Al-Maqam* (standing place), and *Al-Maram* (desire). If you pluralize, the Waw remains sound due to the distance of the plural from the singular and its being in a position of movement. You say: *Maqawim*. This is in Waw-based verbs, because all of it is *Yaf'ulu* with Damma on the 'Ayn. In Ya-based verbs, *Maf'al* with open 'Ayn came in the Masdar, and it is the analogy, like: *Al-Ma'ash* (livelihood). And *Maf'il* with Kasra also came in it, like: *Al-Mahid* (menstruation/place of). The analogy in *Maf'il* in its like is to be the noun of place because it all came on *Yaf'ilu* with Kasra on the 'Ayn.\nAs for the defective verb (*Mu'tall al-Lam*), *Maf'al* from it is open whether it is a noun or a Masdar, like: *Al-Maghza* (raid/place of), *Al-Mad'a* (call/place of), *Al-Mar'a* (pasture), *Al-Marsa* (anchorage), and *Al-Majra* (course).\nKnow that the passive participle and active participle from the first [type] remain sound, like *Wahib* and *Mawhub*, and *Wa'id* and *Maw'ud*. If you build *Af'ala* like *Aw'ada* (threatened), *Awraqa* (leafed), and *Awratha* (bequeathed), the Waw is established. Likewise in the active and passive participles, you say: *Mu'id* for the active, and *Mu'ad* for the passive. Its Masdar is on *If'al*, like *Iy'ad* and *Iyraq*; the Waw turns into Ya due to the Kasra before it. On this basis is its transformation in like: *Mi'ad* and *Mizan*. If you built *Istaf'ala* from it, the Waw would also remain sound. You say: *Istawhaba*. In the Masdar it also transforms due to the Kasra before it. You say: *Istihab*, and *Istiraq* in the Masdar of *Istawraqa*, so know it, and analogize what we did not mention on what we mentioned.\nAs for the hollow verb like *Qala*, *Nama*, and *Dama*, it becomes weak in: *Af'ala*, *Ifta'ala*, *Istaf'ala*, *Infa'ala*, and the like by the transformation of its 'Ayn. You say: *Aqala Yuqilu* (cancelled/resigned), *Iqtala Yaqtalu* (chose/assassinated?), *Istaqala Yastaqilu* (resigned/asked for cancellation), *Inqada Yanqadu* (was led). The transformation of the 'Ayn in these places is either due to its movement and the Fatha before it—do you not see that *Ikhtara* (chose) has the original *Ikhtayara*, and *Iqtala* has original *Iqtawala*, and *Inqada* has original *Inqawada*—or due to shifting the movement of the 'Ayn to what is before it. Do you not see that *Aqala* has original *Aqwla*, and that *Istaqada* has original *Istaqwada*, *Istaqala* has original *Istaqwla*, and *Istamala* has original *Istamyala*.\nThe active and passive participles become weak in all. You say: He is *Muqil* (canceller), and the passive: *Muqal*, and *Mustaqil*, and *Mustaqal*. And he is *Mukhtar* (chooser), and the thing is *Mukhtar* (chosen), it is for the passive on the same weight as for the active. And he is *Munqad* (led). The cause in the transformation of the 'Ayns in these places is as preceded. If you build for the passive voice (*Ma lam yusamma fa'iluhu*), you say: *Ukhtira*, *I'tida*, and *Ubti'a*, done with it as was done in *Qila* and *Sira bihi*. In this there are dialects like what was said in *Qila* and *Bi'a*, so know it.\nSound words have come in this chapter like *Aghyalat al-mar'atu* (the woman breastfed while pregnant) and *Ihwalla* (squinted). These are few words; in keeping them sound they intended to alert to the regularity of weakness in the chapter. The reference in all of it is to hearing (*Sama'*). As for: *Ijtawaru* (they neighbored each other), it is sound because it was in the meaning of *Tajawaru*. Just as the Waw remained sound in *Tajawaru*, it remained sound here. This is as they said: *Hawila* and *'Awira* when it was in the meaning of: *Ihwalla* and *I'warra*. All of this runs the course of anomaly. Likewise His Almighty's saying: (Satan has overcome (*Istahwadha*) them) is among what departed from the regular chapter to alert by it to the origin of the chapter. This is their habit in all chapters of inflection, to alert to the discarded origins with a few words.\nAs for the Masdar of what transformed due to shifting the movement to what is before it, like *A'ada*, *Aqala*, *Istaqala*, and *Ista'ada*, the Ha' is added to it. You say: *Istiqalah*, *Isti'adhah*, *Iqalah*, and *I'adah*. The grammarians said: The addition of the Ha' here is a substitute for shifting the movement of the 'Ayn to the Fa'. The Ha' may be deleted in some of them, and that is like His Almighty's saying: (And establishing (*Iqama*) prayer and giving (*Ita'*) Zakat).",

    "text": "Know that *Ma'ishah* (livelihood) and *Musibah* (calamity), the Ya in both of them is in the position of movement, because they are from the verb *Maf'ulah* and *Maf'ilah*, but the Kasra was deemed heavy in them so it was shifted to what is before them, based on the verb, being a Masdar and an active participle. The analogy in their plural is correcting the weak letter (keeping it sound) and avoiding substitution from it, since what was a Madd (long vowel) in the singular is hamzated in the plural, not an 'Ayn (radical letter), like: *'Ajuz* and *'Aja'iz*, *Sahifah* and *Saha'if*, *Risalah* and *Rasa'il*. So *Ma'ayish* is the plural of *Ma'ishah*, and *Masawib* is the plural of *Musibah*. As for their saying: *Masa'ib*, it is among what deviated from analogy, even if it is frequent in usage, as if they imagined it as *Fa'ilah*.\nKnow that *Fa'ala* in this chapter, and *Tafa'ala*, *Tafa''ala*, *Fa''ala*, *If'alla*, *If'alla*, and their Masdars, all remain sound due to the opening (Fatha) of the weak letter in them and the silence (Sukun) of what is before it.\nKnow that the Waw turns into Ya in this chapter frequently. From that: *Halat Hiyalan* (turned/intervened), and *Samat Siyaman* (fasted). The original is: *Siwaman* and *Hiwalan*, but when what is before the Waw was broken (Kasra), and the verb became weak, the Masdar followed it in weakness. If the verb were sound, the Masdar would be sound too. Do you not see that you say: *Jawartuhu Jiwaran* (I neighbored him), and *Lawadhtuhu Liwadhan* (I sought refuge with him). Among what transformed: *Sawt* (whip) and *Siyat* (whips). When the Waw became silent in the singular and weak, and an Alif occurred after it in the plural close to the end, it turned into Ya due to the Kasra before it. If the Waw moved in the singular, like *Tawil* and *Tiwal*, and there was no Alif after it in the plural like *'Awd* and *'Iwadah*, it would have remained sound. If the Waw turned in the singular, it turns in the plural like: *Dimah* and *Diyam*. Like this in closeness and distance: *Sayayid* in plural of *Sayyid*, and *Dayyawir* in plural of *Dayyar*. Similar is what followed the singular in weakness: *Sa'im* and *Suyyam*, and *Qa'im* and *Quyyam*. This is due to its closeness to the end. Do you not see that if it were far, it would be sound, like: *Qawwam* and *Sawwam*. If Waw and Ya meet, whichever precedes the other with Sukun, the Waw turns into Ya, then the first is assimilated into the second. On that basis: *Sayyid* (master), *Hayyin* (easy), *Dayyar* (dweller), *Qayyam* (caretaker), *Kayyah* (branding), *Layyah* (twist), *Marmiyy* (thrown), and *Maqdiyy* (judged), so know it.\nIf it is said: Why did you say: *Taghazaytu* (I flirted) and *Ta'ataytu* (I took), while its future does not have a broken 'Ayn? I say: This is built on *'Ata* and *Ghaza*, because the Ta entered upon them so they continued as they were. Similar to this is their carrying the future of *Shaqiya* and *Radiya* on the past in turning to Ya, so they said: *Huma Yardayan* and *Yashqayan*, because they said: *Raditu* and *Shaqitu*. So the estimation of: *Salla Yusalli* is *Fa''ala Yufa''ilu*, and the original is: *Yusalliyu*. Likewise *A'ta Yu'ti*. It has been mentioned that *Af'ala*, the original in its future is to come as: *Yu'fi'lu*, on the weight of: *Dahraja Yudahriju*. Just as *Yudahriju* is said, it must be said: *Yu'fi'lu*. The past of these structures we mentioned, its end transformed due to its movement and the opening of what is before it, as I exemplified in: *A'ta* and *Salla*.\nAs for the verb from *Al-Huwwah* (dark green/black color) and *Al-Quwwah* (strength), *Hawiya* and *Qawiya*, the first of the two weak letters in it remains sound so that two weaknesses do not follow consecutively, causing the word to be defective. On that basis you say regarding *Al-Huwwah*: *Ihwawa Yahwawi Ihwiwa'an*. This is how Al-Asma'i narrated it. Grammarians went in its Masdar to saying: *Ihwiya'an*, because if Waw and Ya meet, whichever precedes the other with Sukun, the Waw turns into Ya and the first is assimilated into the second. The analogy of what Al-Asma'i narrated is that he corrected the Masdar due to the soundness of the verb. It may happen in this chapter that the verb of the single feminine agrees with the verb of the plural feminine in pronunciation. You say: *Anti Tusallina*, which is from the verb *Tufa''ilina*. The original was: *Tusalliyina*, so the Kasra on the Ya was deemed heavy and before it was a Kasra, so they silenced it. Two sakins met, so the first Ya was deleted due to their meeting, becoming *Tusallina*. The Ya in *Tusallina* is the pronoun of the doer, and the Nun is the sign of nominative. And you say in the plural: *Antunna Tusallina*. This is from the verb: *Tufa''ilna*, and it is on its origin. So the Ya is the Lam of the verb, and the Nun is the pronoun of the female doers. So consider everything where the pronunciation of the singular agrees with the pronunciation of the plural by this, and estimate it by the sound verb, so know it.\nKnow that there is no noun ending in Waw with a Damma before it. For this reason they transformed: *Adlin* and *Ahuqin*, which are plurals of: *Dalw* and *Haqw*. Yes, it came in verbs like: *Yaghzu* and *Yadnu*. This is like their deeming heavy two Waws in the plural and turning them into Ya like: *'Isiyy* and *Jithiyy*. It indicates their deeming it heavy due to the plural that if they were in the singular they would be sound, that is like their saying: *'Ata 'Utuwwan*. Some Arabs turn it in the Masdar as well, on that is His Almighty's saying: (Which of them is strongest in rebellion (*'utiyyan*) against the Most Merciful) [Quran 19:69].",

    "text": "Know that if the Waw and Ya are running in declension, and before them is an Alif as the third letter or more, a Hamza is substituted for them, like: *Ghidha'* (food), *Siqa'* (water), *Bina'* (building), and *Kisa'* (clothing). This is like their transformation if they moved and before them was a Fatha, and no preventer prevented the transformation. If they were not letters of declension originally or branchly, or the Alif was fixed, they are not transformed, like: *Shaqawah*, *Nihayah*, *Ray*, and *Ay*, plurals of *Rayah* and *Ayah*.\nThe general rule is that what has a weak initial and final letter (*Lafeef Mafruq*), the construction with addition from it keeps the first sound. You say: *awkahu yukhihi* (he tied it), so the Fa' of the verb remained sound as you see. Based on this, if you build *Istaf'ala*, you say: *Istawka*, and *Tafa''ala*: like *Tawaqqa*, and *Tafa'ala*: like *Tawaqa*, and *Tawasa al-qawmu*. The analogy of the end in all is like the analogy of what has a weak final letter. Yes, weakness by assimilation may occur in it, that is like your saying: *Ittaqa*, *Ifta'ala* from *Waqa*. The original is: *Iwtaqa*, so a Ta was substituted from the Waw then assimilated into the second.\nIf you build *Fa'ila* from what has a weak final letter like *Radiya* and *Saliya*, then in connecting the pronoun to it you say: *Radu* so you imply the 'Ayn of the verb, and *Sallu* in the imperative. Likewise in Ya-based verbs you say: *Hayu* a good life. If you built from it *Fa'alu* with open 'Ayn, you would open the 'Ayn of the verb when connecting the pronoun of the absent ones to it. You say: *Da'aw*, and *Ramaw*. That is only so because the original in *Sallu* is *Salliyu*, and in *Baqu* is *Baqiyu*. The Damma on the Ya was deemed heavy and before it was Kasra, so they removed it. Two sakins met: the Ya and the Waw of the pronoun, so the Ya was deleted then the Lam and Qaf were given Damma to suit the Waw of the pronoun. The original in *Da'aw* and *Ramaw* is: *Da'awu* and *Ramayu*. The Ya and Waw turned [to Alif] due to their movement and the opening of what is before them. So two sakins met: the Alif and the Waw of the pronoun. So the Alif was deleted and the Fatha remained on the Mim and 'Ayn to indicate the deleted Alif, so the chapter of *Fa'ilu* does not get confused with the chapter of *Fa'alu*, so know it.\nThe Ya-based and Waw-based verbs are equal if they exceed three letters, because the Waw turns into Ya in the future definitively, so the past was made on Ya as well. On that basis: *Aghzaytu* and *Istaghzaytu*, and *Taghazayna*, even if it is from *Al-Ghazw*, so know it.\n\nChapter: Doubling (*Tad'if*)\nDoubling is when one letter is repeated in the 'Ayn and Lam [positions], like *Radda* (returned), *Madda* (extended), *Farra* (fled), and *Qalla* (decreased). Just as one letter repeated in these two positions, it may repeat, although rarely, in the position of the Fa' and Lam. That is like your saying: *Qalaqa* (worried) and *Salisa* (was smooth). And less than this is the Fa' and 'Ayn. Nothing came in their speech from this except their saying: *Dadan*, which is play/amusement. Adi said:\n*O heart, distract yourself with play (Dadan)*\nThe Lam may be deleted from it so it is said: *Dad*. It came in the Hadith: \"I am not from play (*Dad*) nor is play (*Dad*) from me.\" It also came: *Sayfun Dadanun*, i.e., blunt. There is no third for them.\nAssimilation (*Idgham*) was only authorized in two identical letters if they met, and two close letters, because of their dislike of their meeting. It was narrated from Al-Khalil that they find that heavy like their finding a speech heavy if repeated twice. This is deemed heavy if the rotation of the tongue in the places of letters is considered. Do you not see that whoever speaks the single letter twice needs to rotate his tongue in the place of that one letter twice, so it becomes like tying the tongue? His action resembles the walking of the shackled one if he returns his foot to the place from which he lifted it. The close one in articulation follows a path in this similar to the path of the identical one.\nAssimilation is: That the tongue is placed on the place of the letter, then pressed upon it a strong press, and lifted from it one lift. In this is returning the two letters to the image of one letter. So assimilation in the chapter of the doubled verb leads to a type of lightening in what is deemed heavy, like weakness (*I'lal*) in the chapter of weak verbs, so know it.\nKnow that if two letters of one genus meet in one word, the first silent and the second voweled, then assimilation is necessary. If the first is voweled as well, then if it is a verb, or a noun that follows the course of a verb, then assimilation is necessary. What I mentioned is a precaution against like: *Al-Talal*, *Al-Sharar*, *Al-Badad*, *Al-Surur*, and the like.",

    "text": "If the first is voweled and the second is silent with a non-permanent silence (sukun), like your saying: *Urdud*, *Umdud*, *Uzrur*, and the like, then Banu Tamim assimilate it also after throwing the vowel of the first onto the silent [letter] before it. They have dialects in such cases. Some of them say: *Radda*, building it on Fatha, because Fatha is the lightest of vowels. Some say: *Rudda*, following the Damma. And some say: *Radd*, building it on the origin in the meeting of two sakins. The people of Hijaz show the doubling (don't assimilate) in such cases, and come according to the origin.\nIf the first is voweled and the second is silent with a permanent silence, then assimilation is permissible. On that basis: *Marartu* and *Mararna*, and *Sarartu* and *Sararna*, and the like. Rather, they make deletion a substitute for it. You say in *Zaliltu*: *Zaltu*. Allah Almighty said: (Which you remained (*zalta*) devoted to). And in *Masastu*: *Mastu*. Perhaps they threw the movement of the 'Ayn onto the Fa', so they say: *Zultu* and *Mistu*. On this is their saying: *'Alma Banu Fulan*, and *Bil'anbar*, and *Bilhujaym*, meaning: *'Ala al-ma'* (on the water), and *Bani al-Anbar*, and *Bani al-Hujaym*. This is the last issue in Sibawayh's book.\nThey came to things like: *Tadaraku* and *Tatayyaru*, and intended assimilation, so that forced them to introduce Hamzat al-Wasl. Allah Almighty said: (We omened (*Ittayarna*) by you and by those with you) [Quran 27:47]. The original is: *Tatayarna*. When the first was silenced for assimilation, Hamzat al-Wasl was introduced to it to enable pronunciation of the silent letter. The Almighty said: (Nay, their knowledge arrested (*Iddaraka*) in the Hereafter) [Quran 27:66]. Just as they made deletion a substitute for assimilation in what preceded, they likewise made it a substitute for it in things like: *Tatadhakkarun* and *Tatawaqqafun* and the like, so it was said: *Tadhakkarun*. The preventer of assimilation here is that if it were assimilated, Hamzat al-Wasl would be needed due to the silence of the beginning of the word, and Hamzat al-Wasl does not enter the present tense verb, so know it.\nKnow that letters of Madd and Lin are not assimilated into their likes, because they are elongations with no reliance in their articulations. Some Arabs do not realize (pronounce fully) the two Hamzas if they meet; rather they apply softening (*Talyin*) and deletion to them. Whoever's dialect is this does not assimilate the Hamza into its like. Sibawayh narrated that Ibn Abi Ishaq used to realize the two Hamzas, saying: *A'andhartum*, according to a dialect, so assimilating it into its like is valid.\nJust as a preventer prevented the assimilation of a letter into its like, it happened that [something] prevented the assimilation of a letter into its close counterpart, even if that close counterpart is assimilated into the prevented one. This returns to the excess strength of one of the letters over the other. That is like their assimilating Lam into Ra, and their refraining from assimilating Ra into Lam because the Ra is a letter containing repetition (*Takrar*). If it were assimilated into Lam, its repetition would go away, and that would be prejudicial to it since it would be necessary to bring it out in the form of Lam, then assimilate it. Abu Amr used to permit this and read with it; he says: *Nadhallahu*, meaning: *Nadhard lahu*. Here is a collection of conditions for assimilation, and its chapter is long, and the intent is not to exhaust it, but we wanted to show that assimilation runs the course of weak letter rules (*I'lal*), so know it, Allah Almighty willing.\nKnow that doubling in Waw-based and Ya-based verbs occurs, like *Hayyitu* (I lived), *'Ayyitu* (I was incapable), *Asyaytu* (I twisted?), and *A'yaytu* (I tired). And as mentioned regarding *Al-Huwwah* and *Al-Quwwah*. The 'Ayn in all of that remains sound, and the Lam becomes weak because it is the place of change. If that is so, *Hayiya* runs according to the chapter of *Khashiya*, and *Uhyiya* according to the chapter of *U'tiya*. If a place comes where movement is necessary for the Lam of *Khashiya*, it is necessary for the Lam of *Hayyitu* and *'Ayyitu* also. You have the choice in assimilation and doubling. You say *Hayiya Zaydun* and *Hayya Zaydun*, and *'Ayiya Amrun* and *'Ayya Amrun*. And you say: *Huwa Yahya* as you say: *Huwa Yakhsha*, and *Huwa Ya'ya* as you say: *Huwa Yu'ta*. Whoever said: *Hayiya* and did not assimilate said in the plural: *Hayu* with lightening, so he deleted as they said: *'Amu* and *Radu* and *Khashu*. And whoever said: *Hayya* and assimilated, said in the plural: *Hayyu*, so he did not delete.\n\nChapter: The Hamza\nKnow that Hamza is the heaviest of the letters of the alphabet, due to the effort attached to the speaker in bringing it out from its source, as it involves something like retching. Therefore, types of realization (*Tahqiq*), substitution (*Ibdal*), deletion (*Hadhf*), and 'between-between' (*Bayna Bayna*) attached to it. Among the Arabs are those who realize the two Hamzas, and Ibn Abi Ishaq used to read according to their doctrine.",

    "text": "Know that the Hamza is realized (pronounced fully) at the beginning, whether open (with Fatha), joined (with Damma), or broken (with Kasra), like the Hamza of *Ab* (father), *Umm* (mother), and *Ibil* (camels). If it is not at the beginning, it is either silent with a silent letter before it, or voweled with a voweled letter before it. If it is silent and what is before it is open, Alif is substituted for it if lightened. You say in *Lam Aqra'*: *Lam Aqra*, and in *Ra's*: *Ras*. If what is before it is broken and it is lightened, Ya is substituted for it. You say in *Lam Aji'*: *Lam Aji*, and in *Dhi'b*: *Dhib*. If what is before it is joined, Waw is substituted for it. You say in *Lam Abu'*: *Lam Abu*, and in *Ju'nah*: *Junah*, and *Ji'tu* and *Nu'tu* if lightened. This is if it is silent and what is before it is voweled.\nIf it is voweled and what is before it is silent, it itself is deleted for lightening if not realized. In *Kam'*: *Kam*, and in *Mas'alah*: *Masalah*, and in *Mar'ah*: *Marah*. It was recited in His Almighty's saying: (Who brings forth the hidden *Al-Khabb'*), and it is only *Al-'Ab'* and *Al-Jaz'* if lightened. This is if the silent letter before it is not a Madd (long vowel). If it is a Madd, it is either an Alif, and the rule of the Hamza after it if lightened is to be made 'between-between'. The meaning of that is that the Hamza is produced between the letter of its vowel and itself. If its vowel is a Kasra, it is produced between Ya and Hamza. On that basis: *Qayil* and *Bayi'*, and the like. You say if you realize the Hamza: *Ba'i'* and *Qa'il*. If it is a Damma, it is produced between Waw and Hamza like: *Al-Tasa'ul*. If it is a Fatha, it is produced between Alif and Hamza like: *Sa'ala*; you say if you lighten: *Sala*. Likewise your saying: *Al-Sama'u Fawqi*, and *Min Al-Sama'i Nazala*. This is only governed by oral transmission (*Mushafahah*). If the Madd before it is a Ya with a Kasra before it, or a Waw with a Damma before it, and lightening of the Hamza after it is desired, a Waw is substituted for it after the Waw, and a Ya after the Ya, then what is before it is assimilated into it. You say in *Khati'ah*: *Khatiyyah*, and in *Bari'*: *Bariyy*, and in *Mashnu'* and *Maqnu'*: *Mashnuww* and *Maqnuww*.\nIf what is before it is a Ya with a Fatha before it, or a Waw with a Fatha before it, the Hamza after it if lightened follows the course of when a Waw with a Damma before it or a Ya with a Kasra before it precedes it, in substitution and assimilation. You say in the diminutive of *Af'us* plural of *Fa's*, which is *Ufay'is*: if lightened: *Ufayyis*. Likewise if you lighten: *Ra'aytu Baqaran* or *Ibilan*, you say: *Raytu Baqara* or *Ibil*. If the Hamza is voweled and what is before it is voweled, it is produced if lightened 'between-between'. If it is open and before it is a Kasra or Damma, it is made a pure Ya or a pure Waw. The first is like *Qara'a* and *Yaqra'u*, *Sa'ila* (liquid?), *Mi'in*, *Di'in*, *Shu'un*, *Ru'us*, *Du'il*, and *Su'ila*. The Hamza is produced between Alif and Hamza, and between Waw and Hamza, and between Ya and Hamza. As for their saying *Salta* for *Sa'alta*, it is but a dialect. The poet said:\n*Hudhayl asked (*Salat*) the Messenger of Allah for an obscenity ... Hudhayl went astray by what it said and did not hit the mark.*\nThe second is like *Ju'un* in the plural of *Junah*. If lightened you say: *Jun*. And in *Mi'ar* plural of *Mi'rah* (?). As for the like of their saying: *Yastahzi'un*, Sibawayh lightens its Hamza by making it 'between-between', and Al-Akhfash makes it a pure Ya because of the Kasra before it.\nKnow that if two Hamzas meet in two words like *Al-Sufaha'u Ala*, some still realize them. Some lighten the first of them, based on their saying *Dinar* and *Qirat* from the doubled [letter] substituted from it. Some lighten the second based on the agreed upon saying: *Adir* and *Adam*, which are *Af'al* from *Al-Udrah* and *Al-Udmah*, so know it, Allah willing. Accordingly, you say: *Al-Sufaha*, and you do not make it between Hamza and Ya like: *Ala Al-Bawa*, if you wished. Sibawayh's doctrine is to make the one preceded by Damma a pure Waw, and the one preceded by Kasra a pure Ya, so know it, Allah Almighty willing.\nIf they meet in one word like: *A'andhartahum*, Sibawayh claimed that Al-Khalil was of the view to realize the second, making it between Alif and Hamza if open, and between Waw and Hamza if joined, that is like: *A'unabbikum*, and between Ya and Hamza if broken, that is like: *A'ibili Ra'at* such a place, so know it.\nWe had said: Hamza is a sound letter, even if heavy. We mentioned in the ends of the past chapters that its condition is the Ba' and Ta'. We alerted to what deviated by weakness (*I'lal*) from its chapter due to frequent usage, like *Ara* and *Tara*, and like *Khudh*, *Kul*, and *Mur*. Speech regarding it will pass such that knowledge of its verification will be solidified, Allah willing.",

    "text": "You say regarding what begins with Hamza: *Azama* if past, *Ya'zimu* *Azman*, so he is *Azim*, and the object is *Ma'zum*, and the imperative *I'zim*, just as you say: *Azama* upon it *Ya'zimu* *Azman* so he is *Azim*, and the object is *Ma'zum* upon, and the imperative *I'zim*. On this basis is everything whose initial is Hamza from the triliteral and others; its matter is like the matter of the sound verb. If the Hamza is the middle radical (*'Ayn*), that is like: *Dha'amahu* *Dha'man*, and *Raza'tu* the thing *Arza'uhu* *Ruz'an*. The imperative from them is: *Idh'am* and *Irza'*. If it is the final radical (*Lam*), it is likewise, like: *Saba'tu* the wine *Asba'uha* *Sab'an* and *Siba'an*, and the imperative: *Isba'*. The meeting of weak letters with Hamza is like their meeting with sound letters. You say: *Na'a* *Yanu'u* *Naw'an*, if he rose, just as you say: *Qala* *Yaqulu* *Qawlan*, and the imperative: *Nu'* like *Qul*. And *Na'a* the meat *Yani'u* *Nay'an*, and *Ja'a* *Yaji'u* *Jay'an*, like *Sara* *Yasiru* *Sayran*, and the imperative from it *Ji'* like *Sir*. And *Ana'tu* the meat like *Asartu* the man. And you say: *Wa'artu* *Wartan* *A'iruha* *Waran*, just as you say: *Wa'adtuhu* *A'iduhu* *Wa'datan*, and the imperative: *Ir* like *'Id*. And you say: *Ba'awtu* ...\n\n... So I am close to the ground because of my bending, and if I want to sit, the ground distances itself (*Na'at*) from me due to the disobedience of my joints.\n\nIssue from the Gharib (Strange Vocabulary)\n*Al-Barihah* is a name for the night of your day in which you are, and it has passed. *Al-Barih* is from your saying: *Ma barihtu*, i.e., I did not move away nor disappear. *Al-Barih* from gazelles is the one whose left side corresponds to your left side (passes from right to left), and this they consider an evil omen. *Al-Sanih* is its opposite and it is blessed to them. Dhul-Rummah said:\n*O my two friends, may you not meet as long as you live ... from birds except the Sanihs and lucky ones.*\nAn Arab proverb: \"Who is for me with the Sanih after the Barih,\" a man says it when promised good after evil was done to him. Some of them may take the Barih as a good omen and the Sanih as a bad omen. Zuhayr said:\n*They ran as Sanihs so I said to them: Pass/Cut ... a destination struck by the north wind; so when is the meeting?*\nHis saying: \"Nawan Mashmulah\", struck by the north wind (*Shamal*), and the north wind scatters the clouds. \"Ajizi\": i.e., cut/cross. As if he addressed the gazelles sighing, i.e., I am on a destination of its description, so travel in it. This is if you make \"Al-Nawa\" the object of \"Ajizi\". It is permissible to put it in the nominative position, and make the object of \"Ajizi\" deleted, or treat it like \"Idh hiya\" (when she is), and the address becomes to the self by way of lamentation, as if he said: This is a destination struck by the north wind. The meaning of \"So when is the meeting\" in both aspects is softening and considering distant. *Al-Barih*: The rising of a star in the desert in the East, and its *Naw'* is its setting in the West. So for the star there is a *Naw'* and a *Barih*. *Al-Barih*: A hot wind that blows in the summer. The days of *Bawarih*: Winds of known stars: The star Al-Ridan, Gemini, Sirius, and Scorpio. Dhul-Rummah said:\n*Sometimes clouds and sometimes a dusty Barih.*\nAl-Asma'i recited:\n*O Barih of Gemini, what is wrong with you not seeing ... your dependents have become destitute, hungry.*\nHe said: The poetry is by a thief who loved the wind to blow from it so robbery would be possible for him, which is stealing camels, effacing the tracks. He said: Another found it slow so he said:\n*O Barih of Gemini, what is wrong with you turning away ... while the wealth of the Sheikh has sung, not sitting.*\n*Al-Barih*: Worry and longing tormenting (*Yabrihu*) and distressing. *Barah*: A name for the sun, altered from *Al-Barihah* (the departing/setting one), like *Hadham*. It is said to the archer if he misses: *Barha*, for his deviation from the target, and *Marha*, if he hits, and likewise: *Ayha*, as if from joy (*Marah*).\n\nIssue\nThe difference between a speaker saying: \"Kullu ha'ula'i ashabuka\" (All of these are your companions), and saying: \"Kullu ashabika ha'ula'i\" (All your companions are these). If I say: \"All of these are your companions,\" [it means] every one of them is your companion, and it is possible he has other companions. If he says: \"All your companions are these,\" the benefit is that the totality of his companions are these, and it is not possible he has other companions. If it is said: What is the meaning of your saying: *Kull*, and how was it permitted to add it to \"Companions\" when *Al-Kull* are the Companions, and a thing is not added to itself, evidenced by the fact that no specification is obtained for it by that? I say: As for the meaning of *Kull*, it is a name for the parts of a thing and its units. In this way it was added. Likewise *Ba'd* (some) had to be added because it is like *Juz'* (part). Abu Ali al-Farisi, may Allah have mercy on him, used to argue for the permissibility of entering Alif and Lam on each of them by saying their path is the path of *Ajza'* (parts) and *Juz'*. Since neither of them is prevented from the defining particle, likewise your saying: *Kull* and *Ba'd*. Therefore, addition was necessary for them. Abu Ali said: This is the analogy of Sibawayh's saying. Like them: *Al-Nisf* (half) and *Al-Thuluth* (third) and others which addition is necessary for, from names of parts of a thing. Just as none of them is prevented from Alif and Lam, so too are they, and there is no difference.\n\nIssue",

    "text": "It is said: *Zala al-shay'u yazulu zawalan*, if it separated and did not remain fixed. And another removed it (*Azalahu*). This is intransitive. And *Zala al-shay'u min al-shay'i yazilu zaylan* if he separated it (*Marrahu*). This is transitive to one object. And *Ma zala yaf'alu kadha* (He did not cease doing such), *Yazalu*: Meaning *Ma bariha*. Sibawayh said: It is said from it *Zayaltu* meaning *Barahtu* (I left/separated). This indicates it is from Ya. If it is so, it is as if it is a dialect in *Zala Yazulu*, so this would be: *Fa'ila Yaf'alu* from Ya, and that on: *Fa'ala Yaf'ulu* from Waw.\n*Ma zala* and *Ma bariha* have both been transferred to the category of 'Ibadat' (Auxiliaries/States?), and both stripped for time. So they entered upon the subject and predicate and their meaning is affirmation, because *Zala* is the opposite of *Dama* (lasted), and *Bariha* is the opposite of *Thabata* (remained firm). By the entry of the second particle upon them, which is *Ma*, they became for affirmation, because negation of negation is affirmation. By their transfer to the category of 'Ibadat', they did not suffice with the doer and needed the predicate.\nAbu Ali al-Farisi, may Allah have mercy on him, narrated that some theorists distinguished between them by saying: *Bariha* is not used in speech unless leaving (*Barah*) a place is intended, whether the place is mentioned or not, due to the evidence established for it. Abu Ali said: This is corrupt. Do you not see the saying of Allah Almighty: (And when Moses said to his boy, \"I will not cease (*La Abrahu*) until I reach the junction of the two seas\"). It is impossible that he reaches the mentioned place without leaving his place. If his saying \"La Abrahu\" in the verse is either in the meaning of leaving the place and moving from it, or in the meaning of \"I will not cease\" (*La Azalu*), and one is impossible, nothing remains but the other.\nHe said: And it indicates that their meaning is affirmation, the Arabs' prevention of the permissibility of a speaker saying: \"Ma zala Zaydun illa rakiban\" (Zayd did not cease except riding), and \"Ma bariha Amrun illa muntaliqan\", just as they prevented the permissibility of: \"Dama Zaydun illa rakiban\" or \"Thabata Zaydun illa sakitan\".\nAn objector to Abu Ali in what he rejected could say: I found their saying: \"Lam yazal\" used in the attribute of the Eternal (Allah) Almighty. You say: \"Lam yazal Allahu Ta'ala Qadiran wa 'Aliman\" (Allah Almighty has never ceased being Powerful and Knowing). And \"Lam yabrah\" is not used in His attributes; it is not said: \"Lam yabrah al-Qadim kadha\". If they were equal in meaning, they would run the same course in permissibility and prohibition. Since they differed in what I mentioned, it is due to the difference in their meaning.\nIf it is not said in answer to this: That *Yazalu*, since *Yazulu* was not used in what it was originally coined for, and was transferred to the category of 'Ibadat' with this structure that was not famous for conveying the meaning of cessation (*Zawal*), it became as if its meaning and wording had no relation between them and the meaning of cessation and its wording. So it became suitable after transfer for entry into the attributes of the Eternal Almighty. And *Ma bariha* was used in leaving a place and departing from it and moving from it much before the transfer, and became famous for conveying this meaning clearly. Since its matter before transfer was such, they declared the Eternal Mighty and Majestic far above being described by it after transfer, due to their choice of the noblest words for His attributes, and due to their sufficiency with *Ma zala*. What reveals this and clarifies it is that they described Him Almighty as \"'Allam al-Ghuyub\" (Knower of the Unseen), and refrained from using: \"'Allamah\", even if it is more emphatic in meaning in its place, because of the form of the feminine marker in its wording. And that they do not say in His attributes \"Mu'allim\" (Teacher), even though He said: (The Most Merciful taught the Quran), due to the fame of the word \"Mu'allim\" for one who takes it as a profession. Analogize on what I established for you, you will be correct, Allah willing.\n\nIssue\n*Al-Immar*: The weak of opinion. The Ha is added to it, so it is said: *Immarah*. He said:\n*And I am not of weak judgment (*Rathyah*), an *Immar* ... when led unwillingly, he submits.*\nTheir weight, according to what Sibawayh said, is: *Fi''al* and *Fi''alah*. It is not permissible that it be *If'alah* for two reasons: One is that *If'alah* is not an adjective nor *If'al*. The second: If the Hamza were extra, the Fa' and 'Ayn would be in one place, and this is rare in speech and little. Abu Amr al-Jarmi said: *Al-Immarah* is a type of sheep. And on its weight is *Al-Imma'ah*, meaning *Imma'ah* is *Fi''alah* also, which is the one who follows others. He said: I heard a Bedouin narrating from Yunus who said, my father said: I hate the *Imma'ah* among men. They said: What is the *Imma'ah*? He said: The one who says \"Who is going so I may go *ma'ahu* (with him)\". He did not mean by this explanation that *Imma'ah* is derived from the word *Ma'a*.\n\nIssue",

Based on what he narrated, it is permissible to weigh it as *Uf'uwalah*, so *Asatin* would be *Afa'il*, and *Tasattana* is evidence that the Nun is root. It is also permissible to weigh it as: *Fu'luwanah*, and *Asatin* would be: *Fa'alin*, like *Sarahin* and *Diya'in*, and the analogy of its verb then is to say: *Ta'assata*, because the Nun would be extra. Abu Zayd narrated that the Arabs say if they diminish it by way of truncation (*Tarkhim*): *Sutayyah*, and this necessitates that its weight be *Uf'ulanah*, and the verb from it *Tasatta*.\nHe recited for Abu al-Najm describing the horse:\n*He scatters embers behind him and throws them ... His *Mighwal* (speed?) grips what is between the milestones.*\n*Shining like the flash of a continuous lightning ... In his side the bird is slow in its haste.*\nHis saying: \"Yahthi bi-jamrin\": He means that the horse, due to the intensity of its treading on the ground, you see pebbles flying from under its hooves, so they look like embers, because fire sparks from them. The Ba in his saying \"bi-jamrin\" is inserted for emphasis, and the meaning is: \"Yahthi jamran\" (scatters embers). \"Yanjiluhu\": Throws it behind. His saying: \"Yaqbidu ma bayna al-manar\": He says: As if he gathers what is between the milestones due to his speed. \"Mighwaluh\": What he assassinates/traverses the road with of his running. From it, it is said of the horse: It \"yaghulu\" (devours/traverses) the belt, and \"yaghtaluhu\": encompasses it, if it has a large girth. His saying: \"Lam'an ka-khafqi bariqin musalsalihi\": There is inversion, he means: \"Ka-barqin khafiqin\" (like a flashing lightning), meaning likening the speed to the shine of lightning when it flashes. \"Al-Musalsal\": The continuous. His saying: \"Fi janbihi al-ta'iru raytha 'ajalihi\": Meaning that if a bird is compared to him and measured against him, the haste of the bird would be slow beside this horse.\n\nIssue from the Gharib (Strange Vocabulary)\n*Al-Jarr*: Dragging. *Al-Jarr*: The foot of the mountain. *Al-Jarr*: Plural of *Jarra* (Jar). In the Hadith: \"He forbade the Nabidh of *Al-Jarr*.\" *Al-Jarrah* in their saying: \"I will not do such as long as *Jarrah* (cud) differs from *Durrah* (milk)\": *Jarrah* is what the camel ruminates from its stomach. \"Ma khlafat\" (As long as... differed): *Ma* with the verb is in the estimation of a Masdar with the time noun deleted, as if it was said: I will not do it for the duration of their difference, because the *Jarrah* rises and the *Durrah* descends, so it is in the position of an adverb of time.\nAs for their saying: \"Halumma Jarran\" (And so on/continually), the meaning is: Be slow in your walking and do not exhaust yourselves. It is taken from *Al-Jarr* in driving [camels], which is leaving the camels to graze while marching. *Jarran* is accusative as a Masdar in the position of a state (*Hal*). The intended meaning: Come dragging/slowly. Like: He came walking, and approached running. The Kufans say: It is a Masdar, because *Halumma* has the meaning of *Jurru* (drag), so as if they said: *Jurru Jarran*.\n\nIssue from Morphology (Abniyah)\nAl-Khalil mentioned that nothing was found in their speech on the weight of *Maf'ula'* except three words: *Ma'yura'*, which are the donkeys, *Mashyukha'*, for Sheikhs, and *Ma'luja'* for 'Iljs (strong infidels/donkeys). It has come: *Al-Ma'buda'*, plural of 'Abd, *Al-Makbura'*: plural of Kabir, *Al-Maghfura'*: plural of Ghafur (?), *Al-Masghura'*: plural of Saghir, *Al-Ma'tuna'*: plural of Atan, *Al-Matyusa'*: plural of Tays, *Al-Mabghula'*: plural of Baghl. *Al-Mashyuha'*: Land that grows Shih. It is also said: They are in a *Mashyuha'* of their affair, i.e., in a matter they rush to. And they are in a *Marmutha'* of their affair, i.e., in confusion; it is said: Their affair became confused (*Ramitha*). Likewise, they are in a *Marjusa'* of their affair, with its meaning. *Al-Mafyula'*: Children of the elephant. And land *Masluma'*: Many Salam trees.\n\nIssue\nSome asked about the saying of the Arabs: \"Ma ubali bi-kadha\" (I do not care about such), from what is it taken, and what is its meaning? The answer: It is possible that it is *Ufa'ilu* from *Al-Bala'* (Trial/Grace), like: *Udaribu* from *Al-Darb*. The meaning is that it is not among the graces (*Ni'am*) that are boasted of. Then it was expanded and said in every place. A word may transcend, by use, what it was originally coined for to something else. Do you not see that their saying: *Ta'ala* (Come) is *Tafa'ala* from *Al-'Uluw* (Height), and that it used to be said by one on a hill or mountain to one in a low ground or bottom of land. It transferred by frequent circulation and continuous usage until even the one below started saying it, and until it was placed in the position of: Come to me, and approach me. On this basis the poet's saying is explained:\n*Why do I see you constantly caring (tubali) ... while you have died from emaciation?*",

    "text": "Meaning: No one other than you competed by enumerating the good trial (action) that came from you, while you, from bad condition, are on the verge of death. This method is strengthened by the fact that it is said in its meaning: \"Ma uhtufila bi-kadha\" (Such was not celebrated/cared for), so *uhtufila* is from *Al-Hafl*, just as *ubali* is from *Al-Bala'*.\nSome said: The meaning of their saying \"Lam ubali bihi\": I did not make it occur to my mind (*Bali*). *Al-Bal*: The mind/heart. The aspect of this saying is that *Bali* would be inverted, because *Al-Bal* has a weak 'Ayn. He claimed that what testifies for it is what came in the proverb: \"Ma ubalihi balatan\" (I do not care for him a whit), and what came in the tradition from some of them describing a people: \"Allah does not care for them a whit (*balatan*)\", and the saying of Suwayd ibn Abi Kahil:\n*Mean to you, I do not care for people a whit (*balan*) ... whether they are scattered afterwards or united.*\nThis aspect is weak because Sibawayh mentioned that *Balah* has the weight of *Baliyah*, and that it is a Masdar like *Al-'Afiyah* and *Al-'Aqibah*, so its Lam was deleted for lightening. Like it is their saying: *Al-Hanah* (Vintner's shop/Wine shop? Or from *Han*?), do you not see that in its plural it is said *Al-Hawani*, just as in *Jariyah*: *Al-Jawari*, and that the attribution to it is *Hanawi*. He recited:\n*And how can we have drink if we do not have ... Danaqs at the Hanawi's nor cash.*\nIf the matter in their saying *Balah* is as Sibawayh mentioned, then *Bala* came on its origin with no inversion or change. As for their saying: \"La ulqi lahu balan\" (I do not give it a mind/attention), it is as it is said: \"Ma ulqi lahu sam'an\" (I do not give it hearing), i.e., I do not listen to it. It must be taken from *Al-Bal* (mind). Allah Almighty said: (Indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or throws hearing while he is a witness). Al-Asma'i said in the proverbs: \"Ma ulqi lidhalika balan\", i.e., neither [care] for it nor do I heed it. *Al-Bal*: The state (*Al-Hal*) here, just as it is said: May Allah rectify your state (*Balakum*).\n\nIssue from the Revelation\nHis Almighty's saying: (Until they give the Jizya from a hand (*'an yadin*) while they are humbled). There are aspects in it. It is possible that *Al-Yad* is the favor (*Ni'mah*). The meaning would be: They pay the Jizya out of a favor upon them and gratitude to the Muslims regarding them, which is sparing them as they are, and leaving them with their means and dwellings. The position of *'an yadin* would be accusative as a state (*Hal*). As if He said: They give the Jizya in return for your favors upon them, and as compensation for them. *Al-Yad* in His Almighty's saying has been carried upon something like this: (So they returned their hands to their mouths). It was said its meaning is: They rejected Allah's favors upon them by their denial, rejection, and belittling. Close to it is His saying, Mighty and Majestic: (They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths). It is possible that the intended by *Al-Yad* is power (*Quwwah*), from their saying: \"La yada li bi-kadha\" (I have no hand/power in such), i.e., no power. The meaning would be: They pay the Jizya consequent to your superiority. It is possible it is the limb, and it has been used expansively. The meaning would be: They give the Jizya after acknowledgement to you that your hands are above their hands, and showing humility in their dealings. *Al-Jizya* in their speech: The tax imposed. It was named *Jizya*: because it is a repayment (*Qada'*) for what it is taken for. It is said: *Jaza 'anni kadha*, i.e., paid/satisfied. In the Quran: (And fear a Day when no soul will compensate (*tajzi*) for another soul anything), i.e., will not pay nor avail. From it the demander of payment is called: *Al-Mutajazi*. In the Hadith: \"There was a man who used to lend to people and he had a scribe and a Mutajazi (collector).\"\n\nIssue from Traditions containing types of benefits\nIt was narrated in the report that the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the Muslims, may Allah be pleased with them, on the Day of Uhud, when Abu Sufyan and his party said: \"Rise Hubal!\", they said in their answer: \"Allah is Higher and more Majestic (*A'la wa Ajall*).\" Some asked saying: How is this speech permissible? *Af'al* in the chapter of Preference (*Tafdil*) is placed to come for preferring one over a group he is part of. Therefore, it is added to them, or to an indefinite singular substituting for them. You say: This is the best of the people, and Zayd is the best of men. The meaning is that he is one of them whose merit exceeds their merit. Likewise if you complete it with *Min* (from/than) which necessitates sharing in what the preference occurs in. You say: Zayd is better than Amr. The meaning: His merit exceeds Amr's merit. If you said: Humans are harder than stones, it would not be permissible due to the difference of the two genera. If the placement of *Af'al* in preference is like this, then the Prophet's speech, peace be upon him, cannot be for preference because of what occurs in it of Hubal sharing with Allah Almighty in Highness and Majesty, even if Allah Mighty and Majestic is preferred in the speech. Nor is it permissible that the intended by *A'la wa Ajall* is: Allah is High and Majestic (*Aliyy wa Jalil*), as Ubayd said:\n*So that is a path in which I am not one (*bi-awhad*)*",

    "text": "Meaning 'by one' (*bi-wahid*), because the speech would exit from being situated as a counter and opposition to the disbelievers' speech. If both aspects are prevented in it, then what is it carried upon? The answer: When the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, saw the disbelievers balancing him when he called them to Allah Mighty and Majestic and to faith in Him, or sought victory from Allah Almighty against them and sought fulfillment of His generous promise regarding him, by mentioning Hubal, and claiming in competing and emulating him that they have a god they return to in the issue and rely on for answering, and that they hope for his highness, conquest, and manifestation—until they said to him: You worship our god a year and we worship your God a year, then we alternate on that, so Allah Mighty and Majestic revealed: (Say, \"O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship\" the Surah)—and found Abu Sufyan and his companions rode that path in opposing him and countering his actions that day, he said by way of transcendence (*Tanzih*), magnification, exoneration, and aggrandizement: \"Allah is Higher and more Majestic.\" Meaning: He is too High for anything to be mentioned with Him, and too Majestic for any mentioned thing to compete with Him. This is as it is said: So-and-so is too trustworthy (*awthaq*) to be stopped [for questioning], and too just (*a'dal*) to be judged. If it is so, Hubal's sharing with Him in praise falls. In this way is the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic: (He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned). Meaning His actions in perfection, correctness, and running in the path of wisdom are such that they are not tracked by questioning about them and searching for their locations, while they are questioned due to the possibility of error upon them and the permeation of defect in their actions. This is apparent. It prevails in my mind that Al-Farazdaq intended by his saying:\n*A house whose pillars are mightier (*a'azz*) and taller (*atwal*)*\nThis meaning, i.e., mightier than to be competed with, and taller than to be outdone. And that he did not intend: mightier than others, due to what is in the first of transcendence and grandeur. So know it, Allah Almighty willing.\n\nIssue\nSome asked about the saying of the speaker: \"Ihmil al-mala awwala awwala\" (Carry the money first first). Its syntax and meaning. The answer: Know that the Arabs have two doctrines regarding repeating the like of this. Some of them build them both together, treating them like *Khamsata 'ashara* (fifteen), as they did in their saying: \"Huwa jari bayta bayta\" (He is my neighbor house to house), and \"Laqituhu kaffata kaffata\" (I met him face to face/palm to palm?), and \"Sabaha masa'a\" (Morning evening), and \"Yawma yawma\" (Day day). So he says based on that: \"Ihmil al-mala awwala awwala\" [indeclinable on Fatha]. The intent in all is the intention of the preposition, and implicating the two nouns its meaning. The original was: \"Huwa jari baytun li-baytin\" (house to house), or \"baytun ila baytin\" (house to house), and \"Laqituhu kaffatan li-kaffatin\", and \"Sabahan li-masa'in\", and \"Yawman li-yawmin\". When the preposition was deleted and the two nouns implicated its meaning, building (*Bina'*) became necessary. Just as *Khamsata 'ashara*, when its original was *Khamsatun wa 'asharatun*, then the conjunction was deleted and the two nouns implicated its meaning and were made like one noun, building became necessary. Likewise your saying: \"Ihmil al-mala awwala awwala\", i.e., a first for a first, or a first added to a first. As if he does not wait for every first to have a second, but carries it hastily, until every carried thing becomes a first for a first, or a first added to a first. On this basis: \"Alqa mata'ahu akhwala akhwala\" (He threw his goods scattering?). The poet said:\n*Its horn drops its trained [dogs] from it ... the dropping of the smith's iron, one after another (*akhwala akhwala*).*\nImru' al-Qays said:\n*We inherited richness and glory, elder from elder (*akbara akbara*).*\ni.e., An elder from an elder, and an uncle from an uncle (*akhwal*). Some of them do not intend the preposition, nor make the two nouns one noun, so he says: \"Sumtu Ramadana yawman yawman\" (I fasted Ramadan day by day), and \"Qabadtu al-mala dirhaman dirhaman\" (I received the money dirham by dirham), and \"Ahmilu al-mala awwalan awwalan\". The meaning is: I carry it thing by thing, and batch by batch, i.e., consecutively. If you enter the Fa' it is good and excellent speech and comes according to its origin. You say: \"Ihmil al-mala awwalan fa-awwalan\". Sibawayh claimed that the predominant usage in this entire chapter is that its accusative case is from one of two aspects: State (*Hal*) or Adverb (*Zarf*). If you enter Alif and Lam and say: \"Udkhulu al-awwala fa-al-awwala\" (Enter the first then the first), you must not count them [as defining?], and its accusative is also as State. The estimation is: Enter one by one. Sibawayh likened it to their saying: \"Ja'u al-jamma'a al-ghafira\" (They came the massive crowd), and \"Ja'u qaddahum bi-qadidihim\" (They came their cut with their cutter/all together): in that it is definite but occurred in the position of what should be indefinite, which is the State.\n\nVerse of Meaning\nHe recited:\n*I say to Amr while the gazelles are Sanihs (passing right to left) ... and they are for us the saddles and the game is worn out.*\n*Behold, indeed the dates you are eating ... are the Isb and the cheapened, the torn.*\n*So shoot their eyes (*'anhunna*) or shoot their posteriors (*isbib*) for that is an archery ... by which you will profit with the tanners of Tihama.*",

    "text": "This man is mocking another for being a hunter, and that he buys dates with the skins of wild beasts to eat. His saying: \"Fa-'anhunna\", meaning hit their eyes (*'uyunahunna*). It is said: \"'Antu al-rajula\", I hit him with an evil eye, or I shot his eye and hit it. His saying: \"Fa-isbib\" means hit their posteriors (*subbatahunna*) with arrows and on the backs. This is something by which the skill of the archer is described, because if he hits their eyes and posteriors, the skins are safe from holes, so they don't lose value in selling. It was recited regarding some of them:\n*If they turn away, we hit their posteriors (*sabaynuhum*) ... and if they advance, they are [hit] from the chest/navel (*min nasr*).*\n*Nasr*: We shoot their navels (*sururahum*) and hit them. Likewise it is said for all limbs of the body. It is said: \"Wajahtuhu\" and \"Batantuhu\": i.e., I hit his belly and his face. And likewise all limbs. It is said: \"Nibtuhu\", i.e., I hit his canine (*nab*), because it is from Ya-roots, just as it is said: \"Bi'tuhu\" (I sold it). And \"Suqtuhu\", i.e., I hit his leg (*saq*), because it is from Waw-roots, like: \"Qultuhu\" (I said it). And he says: \"Ra'aytuhu\", i.e., I hit his lungs (*ri'atayhi*). And \"Fa'adtuhu\", i.e., I hit his heart (*fu'ad*), so he is \"maf'ud\" (heart-struck).\n\nIssue\nSome asked about the saying of the speaker: \"'Adhiri min fulan\" (My excuse/supporter against so-and-so), and \"Man ya'dhuruni min fulan\" (Who will excuse me regarding so-and-so), and about its position in speech and its utility. Know that this phrase, I mean \"Man ya'dhuruni min fulan\", can be replaced by: \"Man 'adhiri min fulan\", and \"'Adhiruka min fulan\", and \"Man 'adhiri min fulan\". As for \"Man ya'dhuruni min fulan\", Al-Khalil said about it: Its meaning is who will blame so-and-so and not blame me. It is said: \"'Adhartuhu 'udhran wa 'udhuran wa ma'dhiratan wa 'udhratan wa 'udhran wa 'adhiran\". And \"A'dhartu\" is used in the meaning of \"'Adhartu\". You say: \"Man 'adhiruka min fulan\", and the meaning is: Who excuses you regarding so-and-so. Some recited:\n*O people, who is my excuser (*'adhiri*) regarding the maiming (Jada'ah).*\nAnd he also recited the saying of Amr ibn Ma'di Yakrib:\n*I want his gift and he wants my killing ... Your excuse (*'adhiruka*) regarding your friend from Murad.*\nAnd it is recited:\n*The excuse (*'adhir*) of the tribe regarding Adwan ... they were the snake of the earth.*\nAbu Sa'id al-Sirafi, may Allah have mercy on him, mentioned regarding the saying of the speaker: \"Man ya'dhuruni min fulan\", that it is interpreted in two ways. One is that the meaning is: Who excuses me in my tolerating him despite what I tolerate from him. The second: That its meaning is: Who mentions so-and-so's excuse to me. Then he mentioned that Al-Mufaddal ibn Salamah the linguist objected to Sibawayh when he made \"'Adhir\" a Masdar (verbal noun) and considered his method in it weak. He said: Masdars on [the pattern of] *Fa'il* are the category of sounds, like: *Sahil* (neighing), *Nahiq* (braying), *Shahij* (wheezing), *Hadir* (rumbling), and the like. And that in other than this category it is rare. So according to his method, \"'Adhir\" must be an adjective not a Masdar, because that is the most common usage outside of sounds. So *'Adhir* and *'Adhir* would be like *Shahid* and *Shahid*, and *Qadir* and *Qadir*. So it is as if the speaker, when he says: \"'Adhiruka min fulan\", means: Bring your excuser, and present your excuser, and bring whoever excuses you. Likewise if he says: \"Man 'adhiri min fulan\", the meaning is: Who is my excuser.\nKnow that one of the two ways Abu Sa'id narrated in interpreting \"Man ya'dhuruni min fulan\", which is: Who mentions so-and-so's excuse to me, is remote, as I did not find in the language: \"I'dhirni min Zayd\" meaning mention his excuse to me. As for the other way he narrated, which is: Who excuses me in my tolerating so-and-so, that is its path, except that you say: \"'Adhartu fulanan\" if you elaborated his excuse, and \"A'dhartuhu\" too. What Al-Khalil interpreted \"Man ya'dhuruni min fulan\" with, i.e., Who blames so-and-so and leaves blaming me, is the chosen view in interpreting this phrase. Do you not see that Al-Khalil said that they say: \"Ala ta'dhuruni min fulan\"? He said: Its meaning is that a man is wronged by so-and-so, so it is as if he sought excuse from his addressee in advance in complaining about so-and-so, and clarifying his own excuse regarding the punishment that will come from him, if he chooses to punish him. And that it came in the narrated Hadith: \"People will not perish until they excuse (*ya'dhuru*) from themselves.\" Meaning: Until they turn back with blame upon themselves due to the multitude of their sins, and excuse their Punisher and Adversary for what comes from Him. Some linguists interpreted this Hadith to mean: Until their faults and sins multiply. This man did not bring its explanation separately, nor its verification of the word, even if multiplying sins from them is necessary. As for what Al-Mufaddal ibn Salamah objected to Sibawayh, it is not objectionable, because Masdars outside the category of sounds have come on *Fa'il* frequently. That is: like *Al-Nakir* (denial), *Al-Lahib* (flame), *Al-Wajib* (throbbing), *Al-Rasim* (camel pace), *Al-Khabib* (trotting), *Al-Shamim* (height/smell?), and what is too broad to mention.",

    "text": "Abu al-Hasan al-Akhfash said regarding the saying of Allah Almighty: (And those [angels] who deliver a reminder. As justification (*'Udhran*) or warning (*Nudhuran*)) [Quran 77:5-6], that *Nudhur* and *Nadhir* are like *Nukr* and *Nakir*, in that they are Masdars. Based on this, *'Udhr* and *'Adhir* [are Masdars]. If this is so, then the meaning of \"'Adhiruka min fulan\" is: Establish your excuse regarding him, and bring your excuse. If a questioner says: How did Al-Khalil interpret: \"Man ya'dhuruni min fulan\" as meaning: Blame so-and-so and do not blame me? I say: The lying so-and-so treated him in a way that deserved blame, and required the speaker to hold him accountable and reckon with him. So he addressed the youth saying: Who excuses me regarding so-and-so, i.e., who elaborates my excuse regarding so-and-so who deserved blame in how he treats me? As if that one has no excuse, and this one, if he punished him, would be excused. In the blame of the addressee for that is the clarification of this one's excuse. So he said: Who excuses me regarding him. Likewise his saying: \"Hatta ya'dhuru min anfusihim\" (Until they excuse from themselves), because in their turning back upon themselves with blame is the clarification of the excuse of Allah, Majestic is His Majesty, in holding them accountable and punishing them. On this basis is the saying of Amr:\n*I want his gift and he wants my killing ... Your excuse (*'Adhiruka*) regarding your friend from Murad.*\nBecause whether you make *'Adhiruka* in the meaning of *'Udharaka* (your cheek-strap/restraint?), or you make it in the meaning of *Ma'dhirataka* (your excuse), the path is one in that the meaning is: Seek who excuses regarding him, or bring the excuse regarding him. The meaning of *Al-'Adhir* regarding him is: whoever elaborates my excuse and attaches the blame to him. Therefore, the Commander of the Faithful, blessings of Allah be upon him, exemplified with the verse, because he meant: I choose good for one who plots against me while he seeks calamities. So who excuses me regarding him? i.e., who elaborates my excuse and attaches blame to him if I turn against him. If it is said: What is the difference between what you chose in interpreting: \"Man ya'dhuruni min fulan\"—who elaborates my excuse in my tolerating so-and-so despite what I tolerate from him—the reality of the speech and its correctness is narrowing/restricting his own excuse, and the interrogation would be by way of denial. As if he meant: I have no excuse in what I offer him of forbearance and overlooking given his persistence in what grieves me. And if it is interpreted as meaning: Blame so-and-so and do not blame me, its reality is negating the excuse for so-and-so and establishing it for himself in what he will take him by and in punishing him after that. If you contemplate the two methods, the merit will appear to you and be correct.\n\nIssue of Syntax\nSome asked about the difference between the speaker saying: \"Anta afrahu 'abdan wa 'abidan\" (You are more skilled as a slave and slaves), and his saying: \"Anta afrahu 'abdin wa al-'abidi\" (You are the most skilled slave and [of] the slaves). The answer: The meaning of \"Anta afrahu 'abdan\" is: You exceed in skill the skill of your slave over others. So the skill is \"afrahu 'abidan\" (more skilled than slaves) if his slaves are many. Even if your saying \"'abdan\" is for the genus to remove the illusion that he has one slave. Allah Almighty said: (Say, \"Shall we inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds? (*a'malan*)\"), alerting that the increase of their loss is in deeds of different genera, not one genus. If you said: \"Anta afrahu 'abdin\" (You are the most skilled slave), the addressee is one of the slaves, and the meaning is: You are more skilled than every slave, if they singled out slave by slave. Likewise if you said: \"Anta afrahu al-'abid\" (You are the most skilled of the slaves), because the meaning is: You are foremost among the slaves. If you made \"al-'abid\" indefinite [in the second case], it would not be permissible in any way.\n\nIssue from the Revelation\nHis Almighty's saying: (The companions of Paradise, that Day, are better in abode (*mustaqarran*) and fairer in resting place (*maqilan*)). Some asked saying: If *Af'al* in the chapter of Preference is placed to come for preferring one over a group he is in, then how is the import of the verse when the people of Paradise have no sharing between them and the people of Hell in anything where preference occurs? Know that Al-Farra said regarding this: The people of speech (Arabs), if a fool and a wise man gather for them, they do not permit saying: \"This is the wiser of the two men,\" nor \"the more foolish of the two men.\" They say: We do not say \"This is the wiser of the two men\" except for two wise men, one of whom exceeds his companion. We have heard the saying of Allah Almighty: (Better in abode), so He made the people of Paradise better in abode than the people of Hell, while there is nothing of good in the abode of the people of Hell. So know that from their discourse. End of Al-Farra's words. The method in the verse is that the intent is: The companions of Paradise are more increased in stability in goodness than to be balanced, and more beneficial in exchange than to be measured. This is for aggrandizing their matter and exalting their status. As for preferring one of two things over the other, and claiming increase for it in a meaning of which nothing at all exists in the other, that is far-fetched in both custom and reason, due to the removal of ambiguity from it, the clarity of the situation in it, and the fall of benefit in informing about it. Do you not see that if a speaker said: \"Honey is sweeter than aloe,\" or \"Vinegar is more sour than sugar,\" his report would be belittled, since there is no sweetness in aloe in any way so that honey's sweetness is said to exceed it, nor is there sourness in sugar so it is claimed that vinegar's sourness is more than it. So know it.\n\nIssue from Morphology (Abniyah)",

    "text": "Sibawayh said: There is no *Fu'al* as an adjective in speech except in one word from the weak [roots], which is their saying: \"Qawmun 'Uda\" (Enemy people), i.e., enemies (*A'da'*). *Al-'Uda* may be strangers even if they are not enemies. The poet said:\n*If you are among a people, strangers (*'Udan*), you are not of them.*\nAdded to it is the reading of some: \"Dinan Qiyyaman\" in the meaning of *Qayyim*. Sibawayh can be supported [by saying] that *Qiyyam* is reduced from *Qiyam* which is the Masdar of *Qama*, and it was placed in the position of the adjective. Added to it: \"Makanun Suwa\", i.e., level (*Mustawin*). And \"Lahmun Ziyam\" i.e., scattered. Zuhayr said:\n*Upon crooked legs whose flesh is scattered (*Ziyam*).*\nAl-Nabigha said:\n*At Dhu al-Majaz observing a dwelling, scattered (*Ziyam*).*\ni.e., scattered vegetation. And *Al-Thuna*: Below the master (*Al-Sayyid*). He said:\n*Our 'Thuna' (middle class?) rules over others, and our 'Bad'' (leaders?) ... rules over all of Ma'add, no one repels it.*\nAnd \"Ma'un Riwa\" in the meaning of much water (*Rawa'*). These are five words that escaped Sibawayh. Sheikh Abu Ali, may Allah support him, said: And *Al-Riwa* among them is from the strays which I found.\n\nVerse of Meaning\n*Naive ones (*Ghara'ir*), virgins, beautiful are their arts ... As if the eyes of the *Murshiqaat* (gazelles) are their eyes.*\n*They visit the son of a mother who is not consoled for a deceased one ... his father, and he did not carry its fetus for offspring.*\n*Ghara'ir Ashbah*: Meaning poems he likened to naive women (*Ghara'ir*), who are the pampered, heedless ones, singular *Gharirah*. *Ashbah*: i.e., all of them are choice ones resembling each other. *Al-Murshiqaat*: Gazelles extending their necks; he likened their eyes in their genus to their eyes. His saying: \"They visit the son of a mother who is not consoled for a deceased one,\" i.e., they travel on a path, this is its description, until they reach the praised one. \"Son of a mother\": is the path. \"Is not consoled for a deceased one\": i.e., whoever perished in it, no one is consoled for him. \"Nor did its fetus carry for offspring,\" because he only attributed motherhood and sonship to it metaphorically.\n\nIssue from the Gharib\nIbn al-A'rabi narrated: That the Arabs say in their proverbs when belittling a thing and scorning it: \"Zandan fi Muraqqa'ah\" (Two fire-sticks in a patched bag?). They also say: \"There is nothing in his quiver (*Jafir*) except two fire-sticks.\" *Al-Jafir*: The quiver. *Al-Zandan*: Two pieces of wood by which fire is kindled. It is said: \"Waraytu bika Zinadi\" (I kindled my fire-sticks with you), meaning: Allah strengthened my support through you. It is said of the stingy man: \"Saldat Zinaduhu\" (His fire-sticks failed to spark), i.e., he struck but did not kindle. The poet said:\n*Your fire-sticks failed to spark, O Yazid, and long ... did you pierce your fire-sticks for the destitute (*Darik*) poor (*Murmil*).*\n*Al-Darik*: The poor. *Al-Murmil*: The one whose provision ran out. It is said: He struck and failed to spark (*Aslada*) also: If it availed nothing. And the saying of Amr ibn Ma'di Yakrib:\n*I did not panic nor was I impatient ... and my weeping does not return a fire-stick.*\nHe means that his weeping does not return the trivial thing of little value. The stingy one deprived of luck in good is called *Al-Muzannad* from this. As for the saying of Al-A'sha:\n*And your fire-stick is the best of fire-sticks of kings ... A Markh [wood] met an 'Afar [wood] from them.*\n*And if you spent the night striking a rock in darkness ... with a Nab' [wood], you would have kindled a fire.*\nHe has revealed the meaning. The Arabs say: \"In every tree there is fire, and the Markh and 'Afar gloried [in it].\" So he mentioned them. The meaning of *Istamjada*: took much fire. From it: The beast found the fodder plentiful (*Amjadat*). He describes the praised one with firmness of opinion, and attaining success in demands and victory. The *Yatam* (?) is not pierced due to its hardness, so he said: If you struck with it, you would kindle, i.e., your endeavor succeeds where others fail and toil.\n\nIssue of Syntax\nOur companions the Basrans say: The condition for the verb of wonder (*Fi'l al-Ta'ajjub*) is that it be from the triliteral only. If it increases, wonder is expressed from it using *Ashadd* and the like, which events are not free from. Likewise colors and physical defects (*Khalq*), because the condition for the verb from them is to be more than three letters. Sibawayh said: It is built from what is on [the pattern of] *Af'ala* as well. No one has the right to object to what they say with \"Ma ahsanahu\" (How beautiful he is), \"Ma aqbahahu\" (How ugly), \"Ma atwalahu\" (How tall), and \"Ma aqsarahu\" (How short). That is because beauty and ugliness are not of physical defects (*Khalq*) at all, evidenced by the fact that description by them is only stirred by the sweetness to the viewer or his dislike, not what the thing itself is upon. Do you not see that regarding what he says: \"Zayd, how beautiful he is,\" he might say: \"Amr, how ugly he is\" without a change occurring in him or an alteration happening to him. If the matter is as we said regarding their separation from physical defects, likewise the description of tallness and shortness results from the juxtaposition of another to the one described with one of them, evidenced by the fact that the same thing about which he says: \"How tall it is,\" he might say: \"How short it is\" without it shifting from the state it was on before. If that is so, then lameness, deafness, muteness, and the like of physical defects differ, because the one described by them or some of them is described by them however the matter turns, unless he exits the description by a change from his Creator.",

    "text": "It is not an objection to say regarding the poor: \"Ma afqarahu\" (How poor he is), and for the rich: \"Ma aghnahu\", and for the possible/enabled: \"Ma amkanahu\", and for the upright/straight: \"Ma aqwamahu\", even if the past verb from them is *Iftaqara*, *Istaghna*, *Istaqama*, *Amkana*, and *Tamakkan*, because they only derived it from *Faqura*, *Ghaniya*, and *Qama*, even if some of these were not used due to dispensing with them by others. Sibawayh said: They dispense with one thing by another. Do you not see they said: \"Huwa yadharu\" (he leaves) and \"yada'u\", but they did not say: \"Wadhara\" nor \"Wada'a\"; they dispensed with them by \"Taraka\". He also said in another place: And a thing may run according to what they do not use in their speech, like their saying: *Malamih* (features), *Madhakir* (penises), and *Mahasin* (beauties), and like diminutives that have no magnified form like: *Kumayt* and *Ku'ayt*, and other than that which is frequent.\nThere came in this chapter what has no *Af'ala*, they said: \"Ma ashghalahu\" (How busy he is), while he is *Mashghul*, and \"Ma ajannahu\" (How mad), while he is *Majnun*, and \"Ma amlahu\" (How full), while it is *Mamlu'*. As if they attributed the verb to these things, because they say: \"Ma af'alahu\" regarding what the verb comes from. Do you not see that they say: \"Ma adrabahu\" if he is beaten (*Madrub*). They only said these because they made the *Mashghul* a possessor of busyness, and the *Majnun* a possessor of madness, and the *Mamlu'* a possessor of fullness. So as if they made busyness, madness, and fullness belong to them and treated them as if they said regarding them: \"It has done/acted\" even if they did not speak it.\nWhat facilitates this and brings it closer is that they might come with the adjective according to the analogy of the verb, while they do not speak with its verb. They said: A man *Azfar* for one with long nails (*Azfar*), and *A'yan* for one with big eyes, and *A'naq* for one with a long neck. Likewise a man *Ash'ar* (hairy) and a ram *Asaf* (woolly). As if they said regarding them: As if it has done (*fa'ala*) even if they did not speak with it. It is not an objection their saying: \"Ma anwakah\" (How foolish), \"Ma ahmaqah\", \"Ma ahwajah\", \"Ma ar'anah\", and \"Ma a'ma qalbahu\" (How blind his heart), because these things separated from physical defects (*Khalq*) evidenced by the fact that a human is blamed for all of them and rebuked.\nIf it is said: You claimed that what is triliteral or on *Af'ala* specifically according to Sibawayh's method, wonder is expressed from it by: *Ma af'alahu*. Yet they said: \"Ma ashadda sukrahu\" (How intense is his drunkenness), and the verb from it is *Sakira*, and they did not say: \"Ma askarahu\". Likewise they say: \"Ma ashadda jawabahu\" (How intense is his answer), and do not say: \"Ma ajwabahu\", and the verb from it is *Ajaba*. I say: The first thing in this is that what you claimed against us, we did not say. We said: The verb of wonder is not built except from what is on three letters or from *Af'ala* specifically. We did not say: Every triliteral verb, or on the weight of *Af'ala*, wonder is built from it definitively. Since it is so, what you wanted to compel [us with] has fallen. Moreover, we have presented that they dispense with one thing by another so they do not use it even if analogy requires it. If this is established, and their saying: \"Ma askarahu\"—if it were said—and \"Ma ashadda sukrahu\", and \"Ma ajwabahu\"—if it were said—and \"Ma ashadda jawabahu\", are expressions for one meaning like: \"Ma adrabahu\" and \"Ma akthara darbah\", and \"Ma ahsanahu\" and \"Ma atamma husnahu\", it would not be impossible that one is dispensed with by the other, as was the case in: *Taraka* and *Wadhara* and their counterparts. If it is said: How is what you based the speech on correct for you when they said: \"Ma alsanahu\" meaning: How clear and eloquent he is, as it is said: A man is *Lasin*, and he has become *Lasina* *Yalsanu* *Lasanan*. Likewise they intended by length of tongue fluency and eloquence, and do not intend the tongue [organ] and its length. Since the matter is as we said, the fall of this speech became clear and it appeared that it is a mistake from the questioner or a fallacy, and this is apparent.\n\nIssue from the Revelation\nHis Almighty's saying: (And when it is said to them, \"What has your Lord sent down?\" They say, \"Legends of the former peoples\") [Quran 16:24]. Abu Umar al-Jarmi narrated regarding this that he heard Abu Zayd al-Ansari say about it: They did not acknowledge. The meaning of this is that when it was said to them: (What has your Lord sent down?), they did not acknowledge the sending down in it, but turned away from the answer and said: It is (Legends of the former peoples) and not sent down. So on this basis, it is not carried on being the predicate of the inchoative which is *Alladhi*, as if he said: That which He sent down is legends of the former peoples. But they abandoned building on this and implied \"Huwa\" (It is), turning away from the question, and saying: It is legends of the former peoples, because they rejected that it be sent down.\nIt is permissible to carry it on another aspect, which is: That *Asatir* is inchoative, and its predicate is implied. As if he said: Legends of the former peoples, He sent it down according to you and in your belief. So he brought the speech out as a quotation from them, as He said in another place: \"O magician, invoke your Lord for us\" quoting their speech.\nSimilar to the nominative in *Asatir* is your saying to a man: \"Madha ra'ayta?\" (What did you see?), so he says: \"Khayrun\" (Good [nom.]). And in answer to: \"Kayfa asbahta?\" (How did you become/wake up?), \"Salihun\" (Good [nom.]). And the saying of Labid ibn Rabi'ah on this:\n*Do you not ask the man what he attempts? ... Is it a vow so it is fulfilled, or error and falsehood?*",

    "text": "And for *Madha* there is another position, which is that *Dha* with *Ma* are made like one noun, just as they made *Ma* and *In* a particle when they said: *Innama* and *Ka'annama* and *Haythuma* in the conditional. Based on this is His Almighty's saying: (What (*Madha*) has your Lord sent down? They said, \"Good (*Khayran*)\") [Quran 16:30], i.e., What thing did your Lord send down? They said: He sent down good. Abu Ali al-Farisi, may Allah have mercy on him, recited to us regarding making *Dha* with *Ma* like a noun, the saying of Jarir:\n*O Khazr of Taghlib, what (*Madha*) is the matter with your women ... they do not cease towards the two monasteries, yearning.*\nHe said: Do you see that it does not bear in the meaning of the verse that *Ma* be made in the meaning of *Alladhi* in any way.\n\nVerse of Mu'ayah (Riddle/Puzzle)\nHe recited:\n*Take Abu Umm al-Ri'al, for ... his ostrich fled from a flaming cloud.*\nHe means by Abu Umm al-Ri'al: Qatari ibn al-Fuja'ah, because he was nicknamed Abu Na'amah (Father of the Ostrich), and the ostrich (*Na'amah*) is the mother of the *Ri'al* (ostrich chicks). His saying: \"Ajfalat na'amatuhu\" (His ostrich fled), he means he was defeated when they challenged him. It is also said: \"Shalat na'amatuhu\" (His ostrich rose/died?), and \"Zaffa ra'luhu\" (His chick hurried), and \"Tara ta'iruhu\" (His bird flew). He means by \"Al-'Arid\" a cloud of war, and intended by \"Al-Talahhub\" (flaming): the blazing of its fire and the shine of its weapons.\n\nVerse of Syntax\nHe recited:\n*Is it from the trace (*Rasm*) of a dwelling, a spring campsite and a summer one ... for your eyes from the water of tear-ducts, a flow?*\nSome asked saying: To what does *Murba'* and *Masif* refer, in your saying: \"Li-'aynayka min ma'i al-shu'un wakifu\"? And by what are *Murba'* and *Masif* raised (nominative), if they are not the predicate of the inchoative? The answer: *Al-Rasm* here is a Masdar (verbal noun). The meaning is: Is it from the tracing (*Rasm*) of a dwelling [as] a spring campsite and a summer one that you weep? Just as you say: Is it from Zayd's eating of bread that you weep? The Masdar is added to its object as it is added to the doer. So *Dar* (dwelling), the added-to term, is in the position of the object, and *Al-Murba'* is in the position of the doer, just as the bread in the example we gave is in the position of the object, and Zayd is in the position of the doer.\n\nChapter: From the Anecdotes (Nawadir)\nAbu al-Abbas Tha'lab narrated from Al-Farra, saying: It is said for what remains of water in the cup or other: *Al-Su'r* with Hamza. For the leftover of Nabidh in the bottle: *Al-Basil*. For what remains of musk in the vesicle: *Al-'Itrah*. For what remains in the vessel of honey: *Al-Jils*. For what remains of ash in the fire hearth: *Al-Uss*. For what sticks of bread to the oven: *Al-Quramah*. For what remains in the hive and mixes with what dies of bees: *Al-Maharin*. For what remains in the belly of food and does not exit with excrement: *Al-Thamilah*. For what remains in the nosebag of barley: *Al-Baghit*. For what remains of perfume in the oil flask: *Al-Suwar*. He said: A Bedouin said to his wife: Take care of the *Suwar* for your smell is *Naghilah* (bad). For what remains in the bowl of dough: *Farazdaqah*. For what remains in the platter of Tharid: *Al-Rukha*. For what remains on the table of dough after baking: *Al-Jahfah*. For what remains of flour on the table: *Al-Luwathah*. It is said: She mixed (*lathat*) her loaf with *Al-Liwath*. For what remains of water and is cut off from the sea: *Al-Khalij*. For what remains of it in holes and pits after rain stops: *Al-Husyy*. For what remains on the ground of pebbles if most is scattered: *Al-Julayhah*. For what remains of Henna and dye: *Al-Usom*. He said: A young girl sent to another: Send me the *Usom* of your Henna. For what remains of wool after the teasing of the teaser: *Al-Buqamah*. For what remains in the mill of flour after its flour is taken: *Al-Nubaghah*. For what remains on the palm tree after the dates are harvested: *Al-Kurabah*. For what remains in the trough of water: *Al-Farashah*. For what remains of cotton after teasing: *Al-Sabikh*. For the leftovers of sticks: *Al-Qusarah*. For what rubs off from the ear of corn: *Al-'Asafah*.\n\nIssue from the Revelation\nHis Almighty's saying: (Allah has sent down to you a mention (*Dhikran*), a Messenger (*Rasulan*)) [Quran 65:10-11]. It is possible that *Al-Inzal* is in the meaning of creation (*Al-Khalq*), as He Almighty said in another place: (And We sent down iron, wherein is great military might) [Quran 57:25], and in another: (And He sent down for you from the grazing livestock eight mates) [Quran 39:6]. The *Dhikr* would be Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and the speech would be on the deletion of the possessive noun (Mudaf), as if: The Companion of a Mention, a Messenger. *Rasulan* would be accusative as a description, or if you wish as a state (*Hal*). It is also permissible that it be carried upon another verb, as if He said: Allah sent down to you a Mention, and sent a Messenger, unless *Al-Inzal* means revelation, and *Al-Dhikr*: The Quran. It is permissible that *Rasulan* be accusative as being the object of *Al-Dhikr* (if interpreted as verbal noun), like His Almighty's saying: (Or feeding (*It'am*) on a day of severe hunger, an orphan (*Yatiman*)) [Quran 90:14-15], and like His saying: (Provision (*Rizqan*), a thing). What strengthens carrying *Al-Dhikr* on revelation (*Al-Inzal*) is His saying: (Indeed, it is We who sent down the Dhikr) [Quran 15:9], and in another place: (And We sent down to you the Dhikr) [Quran 16:44]. So just as *Al-Dhikr* is carried upon *Al-Tanzil*, so too it is carried upon *Al-Inzal*, and they are one meaning. So know it.",

    "text": "Verse of Meaning\nHe recited:\n*The 'Najib' advances her when they compete ... when the 'Najib' needs the 'Najib'.*\nHe describes his she-camel saying: When the she-camels compete in marching and strive, this she-camel advances and obtains precedence over her companions, [by] her neck which is like a branch that has been peeled (*Nujiba*), i.e., its bark taken off. He only said this because length of neck and being stripped of fur is desirable in she-camels. His saying: \"When the Najib needs\", he means she does that at the time when the matter intensifies in pursuit or flight, so the noble thoroughbred (*Najib*) of camels needs the whip (*Najib*) and urging with it. So the first *Najib* refers to: The neck. The second *Najib*: The noble of camels possessing nobility. The third: The whip made of skin *Manjub*, i.e., tanned with *Nujab*, which is the bark of a tree; it is *Fa'il* in the meaning of *Maf'ul*. Similar to it is the saying of Isam al-Zamani:\n*He traverses the desert with fatigue out of fear of a 'Najib' ... and he devours the excess of his rein with a 'Najib'.*\n*Yandu*: i.e., crosses and passes. *Al-Mann*: Fatigue. i.e., Despite what afflicts him of weakness and exhaustion, he crosses the desert out of fear of the whip. *Yaghulu fadla zimamihi*: i.e., he stretches his rein and goes with it due to the length of his neck. So the first *Najib* in this verse: The whip, and the second *Najib*: The neck.\n\nIssue from the Gharib\nIbn al-A'rabi mentioned from Abu al-Makarim, who is his teacher, regarding people's saying: \"La tuballim 'alayhi\" (Do not *tuballim* against him). He said: It can be praise and blame. If ugliness is intended by it, it is from their saying: The she-camel *Ablamat* if her vulva swelled from intense lust (*Dab'ah*), which is the ugliest thing. He said: And it is salted (*Yumallah*) so it increases in ugliness. Therefore it was said: As if his face is a salted vulva. It is narrated that Al-Farazdaq entered upon Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. Abd al-Malik said to some of his boon companions: Provoke Al-Farazdaq so we see what he says. When the session settled, that companion said to him: O Abu Firas, as if your face is salted vulvas. Al-Farazdaq said: Look, do you see your mother's vulva in it? The companion was ashamed. This is the aspect of blame. If praise is intended by it, it is taken from *Al-Balma'*, which is the night of the full moon. It is said: His face is *Mublam* if it is filled with light and completed in beauty. He said: And that is called the halo (*Tafawah*) of the moon. They recited to us:\n*As if he is the full moon in its halo.*\n\nIssue from the Revelation\nHis Almighty's saying: (And what makes you perceive that (*Annaha*) when they come, they will not believe?) [Quran 6:109]. Some mentioned that it is not permissible to read \"Annaha\" with Fatha in it, because this speech is cut off from the first, and is an informing that those about whom the verse was revealed will not believe. Reading \"Anna\" with Fatha invalidates this meaning and gives them an excuse for leaving faith, and this is not permissible. So the [correct] way is Kasra of \"Inna\", and the meaning would be that with the signs, they are stubborn also, so they will not believe. The justification for Fatha is that \"Yush'iru\" (makes perceive) runs the course of \"Yadri\" (knows) due to their agreement in meaning, and \"Anna\" is made to mean \"La'alla\" (Perhaps), as the Arabs say: \"I'ti al-suqa annaka tashtari kadha\" meaning: Perhaps you will buy something. So the estimation is: And what makes you know, perhaps they (meaning the signs), when they come, they will not believe either.\n\nIssue containing many benefits from Language, Revelation, and Poetry\nSome asked about the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic: (O wives of the Prophet, whoever of you commits a clear immorality, the punishment will be doubled (*yuda'af*) for her twofolds (*di'fayn*)) [Quran 33:30], and about what was narrated from Abu Ubaydah regarding it and how people opposed him. And about the saying of Abu Dhu'ayb:\n*I repaid you the like (*di'f*) of the love when I shared it ... and no one repaid you the like (*al-di'f*) before me.*\nAnd Al-Asma'i's objection to him in what he said. This is an issue that necessitates expanding speech in its aspects, for it is hardly clear except by that due to the difference of its facets and overlapping of its paths. I will detail its sentences and explain its ambiguity by the power of Allah.\nKnow that *Al-Di'f* (Double/Like) in the language has three places: It can be the like by which a thing is multiplied. It can be: The multiplied thing. And it can be: The multiplication (*Tad'if*). For each of these facets there is a clear meaning and a metaphor. Al-Khalil said: It is said: *Ad'aftu* the thing and *Da''aftuhu* and *Da'aftuhu* if I made it two likes or more. It is said: *Da'aftuhu* with lightening in this meaning also, *Da'fan* so it is *Mad'uf*. Labid said:\n*And they mounted a doubled (*mad'ufan*) and a single whose strings ... are pearls and coral piercing the joints.*\nIt became clear from his speech when he said: \"And a single\", that the *Mad'uf* is: What has a like placed with it and is doubled. If the matter is so, *Al-Da'f* with Fatha is the Masdar, and *Al-Di'f* with Kasra is the like by which another is multiplied. If this is established, it is valid to call the first, to which its like was added and thus multiplied, a *Di'f*, just as the like by which it was multiplied is called *Di'f*, due to their sharing in that each of them is a like of the other, and has been multiplied by it. This is as you say: *Thanaytu* the thing *Thanyan*, if you put a second with it. Then what the first was doubled with is called *Thinyan* with Kasra, and the first with which you double is also *Thinyan*. On this is their saying in numbers: One and Two (*Ithnan*), because One is that which has no second. When a second was made for it to be doubled by, it exited from being one, so the second was called *Thinyan* for doubling the first by it, and the first also *Thinyan* for their sharing in that each is doubled by its companion. So it was said: *Ithnan*, and the original is *Thinyan*.",

Tarafa said:\n*Like the slackened tether, and its folded end (*thinyahu*) in the hand.*\nFor this reason they said: I found in its folds (*athna'ihi*) such-and-such and in its *ad'af* (doubles/folds), so they used them in one way, even though *Al-Di'f* implies being a name for the like of what it was multiplied with, with no increase, while *Al-Thiny* does not imply that. Similar to that is that they made the Masdar on *Fa'l* and the Object on *Fi'l* with Kasra. Their saying: *Naqadtu* the camel in travel *Naqdan*, so it is *Manqud* and *Niqd*. And *Dhabahtu* the bird *Dhabhan*, so it is *Madhbuh* and *Dhibh*. This is frequent. They have inflected this structure in another way. They said: *Da'aftu* the garment *Da'fan*, then they called the doubled garments *Di'fan* with Fatha on Dad and 'Ayn. This is as you say: *Nafadtu* the leaves *Nafdan* with Sukun on Fa, then the shaken off is called *Nafadan* with open Fa. And *Qabadtu* the thing *Qabdan*, then the grasped is called *Qabadan*. *Ad'af al-jawf*: Its layers, some above others. It is permissible that it is the plural of *Al-Di'f* and *Al-Da'f* both. Al-Khalil also said: It is said: *Da'aftu* the people *Da'fan*, I outnumbered them so you and your companions had the *Di'f* (double/multiple) over them, i.e., the multiplication. Allah Almighty said: (So those will have a recompense of the double (*Al-Di'f*) for what they did), i.e., the reward of multiplication or the doubled which you knew the measure of, i.e., they have the right to exceed by that. Do you not see that the exegetes said: He meant by *Al-Di'f* His saying: (Whoever comes with a good deed will have ten like it). Just as they put *Al-Di'f* in place of *Al-Tad'if* (multiplication), they also put *Al-Tad'if* in place of *Al-Di'f*. So they said: I found in its *Tada'if* such-and-such, just as they said: I found in its *Ad'af* such-and-such. Al-Khalil said: The yield of alchemy is called *Al-Tad'if*. Just as they made *Al-Di'f* mean the doubled, they made *Al-Thiny* mean the folded (*Al-Muthanna*). Al-Shammakh said:\n*And all of them competes with the fold (*thiny*) of a shaken [rein] ... like the snake of the mountain, turning away not driven.*\ni.e., a folded rein. This is the mention of the meanings of *Al-Di'f*.\nAs for the saying of Allah Almighty: (O wives of the Prophet, whoever of you commits a clear immorality, the punishment will be doubled (*yuda'af*) for her twofolds (*di'fayn*)), it has been read: *yuda''af* also. Sibawayh said: They are synonymous. Abu al-Hasan al-Akhfash said: The lightened one is Hijazi, and the strengthened one is Tamimi. Abu Ubaydah said regarding the meaning of the verse: She is punished three punishments, because she was due to be punished once, so if the one time is doubled by two doubles, the punishment becomes three punishments. He only said this, in my opinion, because he made the word *Al-Adhab* (punishment) refer to the amount deserved by the sin originally, then that exact amount was doubled twice. So *Di'fayn* according to this is placed in the position of *Id'afayn* and *Tad'ifatayn*, as He Almighty said in another place: (Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times (*ad'afan*)). He means many multiplications. This which he said regarding the verse is not common in it, even if the language does not reject it, because *Al-Di'f* in the verse means the like (*Al-Mithl*), not the multiplied (*Al-Muda'af*), nor the multiplication (*Al-Tad'if*). For this reason, those after him opposed him. Abu Ishaq al-Zajjaj said: What he said is nothing, because the meaning of *yuda'af laha al-adhabu di'fayn* is making the punishment of her crime like the punishment of two crimes. The evidence for that is His saying: (We will give her her reward twice (*marratayn*)). So it cannot be that she is given two rewards for obedience, and three punishments for disobedience. The meaning of *Di'f* of a thing is its like which doubles it, so it is like *Mithlayn*. End of the quote.\nThe matter in the verse is as he said. The meaning is that since they witness deterrents that prevent falling into sins, it is expected from them more than from those who do not witness them. So whoever of them does not do that [abstain], the punishment is doubled for her. Like this doubling is His saying: (We will give her her reward twice). Whenever the punishment exceeds the reward, it exits equivalence. Exalted is Allah above that.\nAs for the saying of Abu Dhu'ayb:\n*I repaid you the like (*di'f*) of the love when I shared it ... and no one repaid you the like (*al-di'f*) before me.*",

    "text": "What was narrated from Al-Asma'i regarding it is that he said: He was not correct in his saying: \"Di'f al-wudd\", because the meaning is \"I doubled the love for you,\" so he should have said: \"Di'fay al-wudd\" (two likes of love). This which Al-Asma'i drove at, if he said it, would be correct on the basis that he named the original *Di'f* because it is doubled by it, and the increase added to it which is similar to it *Di'f* also for this meaning, then he dualized. Similar to it is the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic: (Our Lord, give them double (*di'fayn*) of the punishment), because the meaning is: Double the punishment for them. However, Abu Dhu'ayb did not take this path. Rather, he intended by his saying: \"Di'f al-wudd\", the multiplied love, or the multiplication of love. i.e., I repaid you when I verified that I doubled the love for you. What indicates this is that he said: *And no one repaid you the like (*Al-Di'f*) before me*. He means no one other than me repaid you the multiplied or the multiplication. This is as Allah Almighty said: (So give them a double (*di'fan*) punishment of the Fire. He said: For each is a double (*di'fun*)). i.e., Give them multiplied of the Fire. He said for each is multiplied or multiplication. And as He said: (So those will have a recompense of the double (*Al-Di'f*) for what they did), i.e., the reward of multiplication. Just as it is far-fetched that *Al-Di'f* here is the like (*Al-Mithl*) so the meaning would be they have the reward of the like, it is far-fetched in Abu Dhu'ayb's verse that the intended is \"No one repaid you the like before me\".\nIf it is said: Then what is the intended meaning of the speaker saying: \"Give him *di'f* of his due\"? And what is the difference between it and the speaker saying: \"Give him *di'fay* of his due\"? I say: The intended by his saying: \"Give him *di'f* of his due\" is the multiplied of his due, and the double of his due, i.e., that which became doubled by adding the due to it. And the intended by his saying: \"Di'fay* of his due\" is two likes of his due. So if the due was a dirham, according to the requirement of both statements, he must give him two dirhams. If he said: \"Give him *di'f* of what is with him,\" meaning two likes of what is with him, it would not be correct until he says: \"Di'fay* of what is with him,\" intending two likes of what is with him. This is built on what we presented of the meanings of *Di'f*. So contemplate it, Allah willing.\nIf it is said: Did you not claim that *Al-Di'f* can be in the meaning of multiplication (*Tad'if*), and multiplication and doubling are for what exceeds two, evidenced by His Almighty's saying: (The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a grain which grows seven ears; in every ear is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies (*yuda'ifu*) for whom He wills). So why didn't you carry it on that in these issues? The answer: Such issues and what enters into acknowledgments and wills and their likes must be interpreted from what is suitable for them to the lowest ranks and the least number, if stripped of context clues, if that is necessary, and not interpreted to the more and the higher except by evidence indicating it and necessitating it. Since it is so, diverting *Al-Di'f* to the meaning of the like (*Al-Mithl*), and the doubled to the dual, is the most appropriate until an indication is seen with it necessitating exceeding them to the many.\nAl-Khalil and others said: *Al-Kifl* of reward and sin is *Al-Di'f* (double/like). Like His saying: He has two portions (*Kiflan*) of reward and upon him are two portions of sin. Similar to it is His saying, Mighty and Majestic: (He will give you two portions (*Kiflayn*) of His mercy). And His saying: (And whoever intercedes a bad intercession will have a portion (*Kifl*) of it). They said: And it is not said: \"This is the *Kifl* of so-and-so\" until you have prepared a like of it for another, like *Al-Nasib* (share). If you isolate, you do not say: *Kifl* nor *Nasib*. Some said: It is possible that *Al-Kifl* is from *Kafala fulanun fulanan* if he supported him and spent on him.\n\nIssue of Syntax\nSome mentioned the saying of the poet:\n*In a night of Jumada possessing clubs (*Andiyah*).*\nHe said: How did *Nada* come as *Andiyah*, while *Af'ilah* is the plural of the extended (*Mamdud*) not the shortened (*Maqsur*)? You say: *Rida'* and *Ardiyah*, *Kisa'* and *Aksiyah*, *Qadha* and *Aqdhiyah*, *Raha* and *Arha'*. The answer: Abu al-Abbas said: It is the plural of *Nadan*, like the poet's saying:\n*Two days: A day of assemblies (*Maqamat*) and clubs (*Andiyah*).*\nThe meaning: In a Jumada night, due to the prevalence of drought in it and the difficulty of time on its people, the rich take gatherings in it to manage the poor and prepare slaughtered camels for gambling (*Maysir*), and mending the people of poverty and misery. Abu al-Hasan al-Akhfash said: He pluralized *Nadan* as *Nida'*, like *Jabal* and *Jibal*, then pluralized *Nida'* as *Andiyah* like *Rida'* and *Ardiyah*. Some said: He pluralized *Fa'al* as *Af'ul*, like *Zaman* and *Azmun*, and *Jabal* and *Ajbul*, so it became *Andin* like *Aydin*. Then he feminized this *Af'ul* with Ta, so it became *Andiyah*, as it was said: *Fuhulah*, *Bu'ulah*, and *Hijarah*, to emphasize the femininity of the plural. So *Andiyah* according to this is *Af'ilah*. Some Kufans said: It is anomalous in plurals, and like it: *Qafa* and *Aqfiyah*, and *Raha* and *Arhiyah*. Al-Farra and Ibn al-Sikit narrated these two.\n\nVerse of Meaning\nIt was recited for Al-Hutay'ah:\n*You got angry at us because we killed Khalid ... with Banu Malik? Behold, this is a rain (*Mutr*) anger.*",

    "text": "The *Mutr* anger is that which is placed in other than its place. It is that the like of Mudar is mentioned with something disliked, so a man from Bal'am gets angry for it, while they are adopted sons in Mudar. So the speaker says: This is a *Mutr* anger, i.e., What are you to Mudar, and what is your share of Mudar? *Al-Mutr* originally: is that he comes from the sides (*Turar*) of the valley. In the proverb: \"Atirri (take the side/edge) for you are wearing sandals.\"\n\nChapter\nAnecdotes and Proverbs\nIt is said: \"This is the first (*Rayyiq*) of the rain, so beware its main part.\" It is struck when a matter is feared for its harm and its beginning has appeared. It is said: \"That was from him in the prime (*Rayyiq*) of youth and its *Rayq*,\" just as you say: *Hayyin* and *Layyin* and *Hayn* and *Layn*. The original is *Rawq* of youth. *Rayyiq* is *Fay'il* and it has been assimilated, because if Waw and Ya meet, whichever precedes the other with Sukun, the Waw turns into Ya then the first is assimilated into the second.\nIt is said: \"The lied-to (*Makdhub*) does not know how to deliberate.\" Similar to it: \"The lied-to has no opinion.\"\nA man said to Al-Hasan: \"I vomited while I was fasting.\" He said: \"Did the vomit return (*Ra'a*) upon you?\" He says: Did anything of it return after it exited.\nAl-Asma'i said: I was told about Qash'am from the wise men of the Arabs, and he was a man of opinion, experience, and honor: \"Where should your food be?\" He said: \"In the belly of a nursing mother, or in the belly of one who cuts ties of kinship, or a hungry child, or a humble elder, or a far-traveling wayfarer, or a humble captive.\"\nAmr ibn al-As said: \"The wise is not he who knows good from evil, but the wise is he who knows the better of two evils.\"\n*Na'l Simt*: If it is not patched. *Na'l Asmat*, *Qamis Asmat*, and *Sarawil Asmat*: If it is unlined. This is like your saying: *Thawb Khalaq* and *Akhlaq*. The poet said:\n*Upon trousers of his, unlined (*Asmat*).*\nIt is said: *Habl Armam* and *Aqta'* and *Armath*, *Burqah A'shar*, and *Thawb Akbas* for a type of linen. It is said: So-and-so intervened (*Takhallala*) with an arrow in the battle of such-and-such, if he was hit and his presence at that battle was out of arrogance. This is sarcasm, i.e., he was not in need of it, and by his meddling he fell into it. Similar to this course is the poet's saying:\n*When they urinated, the horses' hooves were ... containers for the urine, and water was colder.*\nHe says: They were free from what they came to, and water would have been colder had they not exceeded it out of insolence. This is sarcasm and mockery.\nSo-and-so came and two men supported him (*Ibtaddahu*), if each of them took one of his sides. And what power does so-and-so have if his two sons or two brothers supported him.\n*Al-Khalaf* voweled is: The substitute. If silent (*Al-Khalf*), it is: The offspring, whether good or bad. Allah Almighty said: (So there succeeded after them a successor (*Khalf*)). He said: *And I remained in a successor (*Khalf*) like the skin of the mangy one.* Some recited:\n*And the battlefield of a chest from Rabi'ah is good ... and the *Washiz* and *Za'anif* flew among them.*\n*Al-Za'anif*: Excess leather and what falls from its edges. *Al-Washiz*, singular *Washizah*, is: A small stick used to plug a gap in the drinking bowl if it cracked, not from it. It is said: *Washizah* and *Washiz* and *Washa'iz*. It is narrated that a man complained to Al-Farazdaq about his wife. He said: Clothe her with the *Muhrijat*. He says: Divorce her three times. It is said: *Ahrijha* upon yourself, i.e., divorce her.\n*Al-Ahabish*: Mixed groups of people with no lineage uniting them. Among them are *Ahabish* of Kinanah, i.e., those whom people joined and allied with. They were singled out by this name, just as it was said for Asad and Ghatafan \"The Two Allies\", while in the Arabs there are many tribes that allied and were not singled out as \"The Alliance\". This fame has occurred in individuals; do you not see that whenever Ibn Abbas is said, the name does not race to anyone but Abdullah, and likewise if Ibn al-Zubayr and Ibn Abi Talib are said, Abdullah and Ali, peace be upon him, are intended, even if each of them had a brother sharing the lineage.\nIbn al-A'rabi mentioned that some of their eloquent ones were asked: Does the *Jadha'* (young camel) impregnate? He said: No, nor does he let alone (*Yada'*), meaning he sends [semen] but it is futile. It was said: Does the *Thiny* (older camel) impregnate? He said: Yes, and he is slow (*Aniyy*). It was said: Does the *Riba'* (four-year-old) impregnate? He said: Yes, by the placing of a cubit. He said: And it is said: If a *Riba'* and a *Qarih* (full-grown) gather in a herd, the *Riba'* expels the *Qarih*.\nAl-Asma'i said: I heard a storyteller in Basra saying: The believer, his garment is an *'Ilqah*, his broth is a *Sulqah*, his fish is a *Shilqah*, and his lunch is a *Falqah*. He said: *Al-'Ilqah* and *Al-Baqir* are one thing, which is: The garment is taken and split then the man wears it, and it has no sleeves or gussets.\nHe said: I asked a woman of the Arabs about *Al-Shighaf*. She said:\n*A fox that has no description ... By Allah, Khufaf does not take it.*\n*He is unable or perishes or fears ... They seek her while she has a *Shighaf*.*\n*Al-Shighaf* is a disease under the rib cartilages. He said: And it is said the kindling (*Diram*) of Fitna is speech. And it is said: I saw him eating the eating of the hungry, cold person.",

    "text": "Among their proverbs: Quenching (*Al-Ri*) is not by sipping (*Al-Tashaff*). He means quenching is not to drink everything in the vessel. *Al-Tashaff* is *Tafa'ul* from *Al-Shafahah* (lips? residue?). It is said: So-and-so, if he drinks, he sips all (*Ishtaffa*), and if he eats, he wipes clean (*Laffa*). It is said: He poured out his vessel (*Tasabba*), if he took its residue (*Sababah*). It is said: Nothing remains of the world except a residue like the residue of a vessel, its owner pours it out.\nNames of the arrows (*Qidah*): *Al-Fadhdh*, *Al-Taw'am*, *Al-Raqib*, *Al-Hils* (and it is said *Al-Hils* on the pattern of *Al-Kitf* and it is the original), *Al-Nafis*, *Al-Musfah*, and *Al-Mu'alla*. These possess shares. *Al-Safih*, *Al-Manih*, and *Al-Waghd* have no shares, but whenever they come out, they are returned to the arrows to increase their number.\nAl-Asma'i narrated, saying: A man from the Arabs entered a cave with brothers of his. The cave collapsed on them, so his brothers perished and he escaped. He married into a tribe of Arabs after that, and caused an event among them, so he feared them. He remained absent from them for a time, then returned to them. Recognizing his family was difficult for them. He began tracking the women's litters and saying: \"Have you heard of the sons of a mother who died of grief except a youth who did not commit a deed, nor saw a maternal uncle do it nor a paternal uncle?\" They would say: \"Away with you!\" He continued like that until he passed by his wife, and she recognized him. She threw his son to him—and the son had a mole—and said: \"The one with the mole, take him. And our brother, pay his blood money. And the people, beware of them.\" He carried his son and departed. He said to the *Ashyam* (mole-possessor): \"What do you see?\"—and he is the one with the mole. He said: \"I see a curved, long [neck?], the whip running on her upper chest.\" He means by *Labbat* the upper chest of the horse. *Al-Ghut*: A type of galloping and seeking. *Al-But*: Following the *Ghut*. He said to him: \"Look, what do you see?\" He said: \"I see upon your neighbor one leaning (*Warik*), holding on or perishing.\" Then he said to him: \"What do you see?\" He said: \"I see a swollen, full (*Hadrah Badrah*) from our horses or the horses of the family of Murrah.\" He said: \"Dismount, swollen full (*Hadrah Badrah*),\" i.e., swollen, hurrying.\nFrom their proverbs: \"Do that as long as your grazing herd is safe.\" The explanation of this is what some narrated that he said: So-and-so will not desist from such until Allah strikes him with a thunderbolt or a calamity from which his head (*Sha'wuhu*) flees. The poet has in his manner his saying:\n*If the shepherd of the lambs is driven while the lambs are fleeing.*\n\nIssue from Morphology (Abniyah)\nAl-Khalil claimed that there is nothing in their speech on the pattern of *Fu'allah* except three words: *Humarrah* (intense heat), *Subarrah* of winter (intense cold), and *Zu'arrah* of character (bad temper). It has come: I came to him at the *Hiballah* of that, i.e., at the time of that. And he threw upon him his *'Uballah*, i.e., his weight. And the people came with their *Zuraffah*, i.e., with their group. *Zurafi* is also narrated, meaning groups. It is narrated from Al-Hajjaj that he said: \"Keep me away from these *Zurafi*,\" i.e., groups. And this is the *Jurabbah* of So-and-so, i.e., his family if they are old. It is said *Jurabbah* also. Al-Asma'i recited:\n*Jurabbah like the red donkeys of Al-Abakk ... there is no weak one among them nor a milker (?).*\nAnd in it is *Mudharrah*: i.e., wasting wealth. And in it is *Du'arrah*: i.e., malice. From it is the *Da'ir* wood, which is smoky. And *Al-Humarrah* is dandruff of the head.\n\nChapter\nOn what Al-Khalil was attributed to misspelling or deficiency in\nHe claimed that the dotted Ghayn, Ha, and Mim do not gather in a word. He denied *Al-Hamigh* (Death), and said: It is *Al-Hami'* with 'Ayn. This is authentic, narrated. It is derived from *Hamagha ra'sahu*, i.e., crushed it. It is said: *Inhamagha* the thing, i.e., broke. And a sore *Munhamighah* i.e., wet. Darkness is called: *Ghayham* and *Ghayhab*. He mentioned in the chapter of Ha and Qaf: *Al-Qarih*: The bow whose string separated from its grip. Rather it is *Al-Farij*. In the chapter of dotted Kha and Sad: *Al-Khisb*, the snake. Rather it is *Al-Khidb*. In the chapter of undotted Ha: *Al-Habir*, the foam. Rather it is *Al-Khabir* with dotted Kha. The Hudhali said:\n*They chewed at its edges the foam (*Al-Khabir*) ... its bag tore and it was spilled.*\n*Taghadhdhamna* i.e., chewed. *Al-Khabir*: Foam. This is a metaphor he struck for clouds. Meaning: \"Its bag tore,\" meaning its water, as if the earth permitted it and took it away. He said in the chapter of dotted Dhal and Ba: A thing *Rabidh* i.e., piled up. Rather it is *Rathid* with Tha and Dal. He said in the chapter of Zay and Ra with Ba: A ram *Zabir*, i.e., big-bellied, full, placing Zay first. Rather it is *Rabiz* placing it last. He said in the chapter of Kaf and Ta with Mim: *Al-Takmah*: The walking of the blind without a guide. Rather it is *Al-Takammah* from *Al-Akmah*, who is born blind. He mentioned in the chapter of Qaf and Ya in the Lafif: *Taqayya'at* the woman to her husband if she bent over him coquetting. Rather it is *Tafayya'at* with Fa. He said in the chapter of weak letters: *Al-Malaqat*: Top of the mountain on the pattern of *Maf'alah*, and its plural is *Al-Malaqi*. Rather it is *Al-Malaqat* and its plural is *Malaq* on the pattern of *'Alaqah*. He claimed that 'Ayn and Ha do not combine in a word with original letters, yet it has been found: It is said *It'anjaha* the water, meaning exploded.\n\nVerse of Meaning",

    "text": "By Al-Kumayt ibn Zayd:\n*I exited the exit of the arrow (*Qidh*), the arrow of Ibn Muqbil ... despite those barking ones and the setter [of dogs].*\n*Upon me are the clothes of beautiful women, and beneath them ... a determination of an affair that resembled the drawing of a blade.*\nKhalid al-Qasri had imprisoned Al-Kumayt. His wife attended the prison, so he wore her clothes and exited disguised as her and unrecognized, so he was safe and escaped. The arrow of Ibn Muqbil is used as a proverb for winning. Al-Kumayt struck it as a proverb for himself when he exited the prison. The arrow of Ibn Muqbil was a winner known for that; he had described it well in his poetry and repeated its mention. The Arabs used to hire it, borrow it, and take it as a good omen. Al-Hajjaj wrote to Zayd ibn al-Husayn, who was over Isfahan: \"My likeness and your likeness is the arrow of Ibn Muqbil.\" Zayd did not know what he meant, until he met a Syrian man and asked him about it. He said: \"He informs you that I will overcome you.\" When Al-Kumayt fled from prison, he joined Maslamah, and said:\n*O Maslamah ibn Abi al-Walid ... for a dead man, if you wish, a reviver.*\n*He crossed the deserts, crossing ... with you in the midday heat of Bajir.*\n\nIssue of Syntax\nTheir saying: \"Khalaqa Allahu al-zarafata yadayha atwala min rijlayha\" (Allah created the giraffe, its forelegs longer than its hind legs). *Yadayha* is a substitute (*Badal*) for the giraffe. *Atwala* is accusative as a state (*Hal*). It was only permitted to be a state because it transitions in length, becoming longer bit by bit, as the poet said:\n*And wealth with bunches of unripe dates, red (*ahmara*).*\nHe made *ahmar* accusative as a state, because the bunches transition into redness; otherwise it would not be permissible. As for His Almighty's saying: (And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied about Allah, their faces blackened (*wujuhuhum muswaddah*)) [Quran 39:60], *wujuhuhum* is raised by inchoative (*Ibtida'*), and *muswaddah* is its predicate. It is like your saying: \"Ra'aytu Zaydan abuhu afdalu minhu\" (I saw Zayd, his father is better than him). It was only permitted in both because the pronoun refers back to the first from its cause. It is permissible to make *wujuhuhum* accusative by making it a substitute for *alladhina* (those who), and it would be like the speaker saying: \"Ra'aytu mata'aka ba'dahu ahsana min ba'd\" (I saw your goods, some of them better than others). There is no preventer preventing its permissibility, except that the readers agreed on the revelation of the reading with it [nominative] without a cause [for accusative?].\n\nIssue from the Revelation\nHis Almighty's saying: (And every human, We have fastened his bird (*ta'irahu*) to his neck, and We will bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a record which he will encounter spread open. Read your record. Sufficient is yourself against you this Day as accountant) [Quran 17:13-14]. His saying: \"Ta'irahu\" means his deed of good and evil. The deed was validly named a \"bird\" only because it precedes its doer, so it is as if it flies from him, so he possesses no catching up or overtaking of it. Based on this it is said: \"Fajrun mustatir\" (spreading dawn), and \"Ghabarun mustatar\" (flying dust). Al-Khalil said: Such is the speech of the Arabs. Al-Ba'ith said:\n*So a swift, strong she-camel folded with him a large [desert] ... When the glory of living was counted, she advanced between it.*\nHe means: She broke wind with it, and preceded with it. Resembling this is their saying: *Al-Furut*: What preceded of a deed or child for which you have a reward. It is said: \"Farata lahu waladun\", i.e., he preceded to Paradise. In supplication: \"O Allah, make him for us a *Faratan*\", i.e., a preceding reward. Its origin is: *Al-Farit* who precedes the people to the water. Labid said:\n*So we arrived before the scouts (*Furrat*) of the sandgrouse ... Indeed part of my arrival is the early morning drinking.*\nThe meaning of (We have fastened his bird to his neck) is: We have fastened to him the recompense of his deed which he sent forth. So it is his predecessor, if good then good, and if evil then evil, hung on him and accompanying him. The position of his saying: \"Fi 'unuqihi\" (in his neck) is accusative as a state. They are fond of mentioning the neck (*'Unuq* and *Raqabah*) and use it as a metonymy for the whole human. This is their saying: \"So-and-so freed a neck (*raqabah*)\" regarding a slave, and \"This trust is in his neck.\" They say: \"The Sultan necklaced him (*qalladahu*) such-and-such in authority,\" and \"He pledged his neck (*muqalladahu*) for such,\" just as they said: \"He occupied his liability (*dhimma*) with such.\" Bishr said describing a treacherous woman, Hadir:\n*And Ja'far necklaced her with the necklace of the pigeon.*\nAl-Asma'i recited the saying of Ibn Abi Rabi'ah, having used metonymy for the neck:\n*Indeed I have a need from you. She said ... Between my ear and my shoulder is what you want.*\ni.e., in my neck. This which we mentioned is what most of the predecessors are upon, and I have explained it to my ability.",

    "text": "Some of them mentioned that the intended by \"his bird\" (*Ta'irahu*) is what flies to the human or from him of beloved or disliked things. He said: This is as the Arabs used to hold regarding augury (*Zajr al-Tayr*) and inferring occurring matters by it. Allah Almighty said, quoting a people addressing their Prophet when they saw bad omens, and in his answer to them: (They said, \"We augur evil (*ittayyarna*) by you and by those with you.\" He said, \"Your omen (*Ta'irukum*) is with Allah\") [Quran 27:47]. On this basis is the saying of Muslims in disavowing augury: \"O Allah, there is no bird (*Tayr*) except Your bird, and no good except Your good, and no Lord other than You.\" So the meaning would be: Every human, We have fastened the recompense of his omen to his neck. Its metaphor and explanation would be as I mentioned. This speech contains severe deterrence and eloquent restraint from committing sins, because if the intended knows his knowledge (deed) sticks to him and is certain of its falling upon him, he refrains from much of what he desires. Allah Almighty has explained that and clarified the situation in it by His saying: (And We will bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a record which he will encounter spread open). His saying: (We bring forth for him a record), \"Kitaban\" is accusative as an object. The evidence of the verse is His saying: (This, Our record, speaks about you in truth) [Quran 45:29]. His saying: (which he will encounter spread open) is in the position of an adjective for \"Kitab\". Its evidence is His saying: (And when the pages are spread open) [Quran 81:10]. As for His saying: (Read your record), it is on the implication of saying (*Qawl*), as if the meaning is: And We say to him: Read your record, or: And it is said to him: Read your record. It is narrated from Al-Hasan that he said: \"He has been fair to you, O son of Adam, who made you the accountant of yourself.\" He, Majestic is His Majesty, only informed us of the matter of the Guardian Angels and those who count our deeds against us, as a piety-inducing deterrent (*Taqwa Al-Rawa'i*) from sins. His saying: (Sufficient is yourself against you this Day as accountant). If it is said: Why didn't He say \"against you and for you\", because the threatened record undoubtedly contains what is for him of good deeds and against him of bad deeds, and because if the threat is accompanied by fairness and built upon it, it is more eloquent in exhortation? The answer: The word \"Alayka\" (against you) can be attached to His saying: \"Iqra'\" (Read), as if He said: Read your record against yourself; sufficient is yourself as an accountant. The position of \"Bi-nafsika\" is nominative as the doer of \"Kafa\", and \"Hasiban\" is accusative as a state (*Hal*) or specification (*Tamyiz*). Were it not for avoiding repetition, the more appropriate way would be to say: Read your record against yourself, because the most common usage in the imperative is to say: Take for yourself such, and make for yourself such. But He disliked saying: Read your record against yourself, sufficient is yourself. So this is one aspect. It is permissible that it attaches to His saying: \"Kafa\" (Sufficient), as if He said: Your self suffices against you as an accountant. The position of \"Alayka\" would be accusative as a state, i.e.: Your self suffices while it is against you, not for you and with you. The meaning would be like what His saying in another place includes: (On a Day when their tongues, their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do) [Quran 24:24]. It is permissible that it attaches to His saying: \"Hasiban\", and it is in the position of a state, i.e.: Your self suffices as a fulfiller (*Mustawfiyan*) against you today, because the meaning of *Hasib*, *Mustawfi*, and *Muhasib* is one. I do not know anyone who explained this verse like what we mentioned.\n\nIssue from Morphology (Abniyah)\nSibawayh said: *Maf'il* with Kasra on the 'Ayn did not come from the defective Lam; it only came with Fatha like: *Al-Marma*, *Al-Mad'a*, and *Al-Malma*. Al-Farra said: Two words came on it, which are: *Ma'qi al-'Ayn* (Eye corner) and *Ma'wi al-Ibl* (Camel shelter). As for exemplifying *Ma'q* as *Maf'il*, it is a mistake. That is because in this word there are several dialects: *Muq*, *Ma'q*, and *Maq*, on the weight of *Qadin*. All of that testifies that the Mim of the word is the Fa' of the verb. It is not permissible that it be among words with two dialects where one letter in one dialect is original and in the other extra, because what is of this nature must have indications in the word's conjugations, and nothing permitting contrary to what I mentioned was allowed. As for *Ma'wi al-Ibl*, it is strange and not counted. If it is said: Then among the dialects in it is *Ma'qa*; so on this, what is its weight? I say: Its weight is *Fa'la*, and it is as if the addition in it entered upon *Fa'l* so it became *Fa'la*. The addition of Ha in the end of this is like the addition of Alif in *Qaba'thara*, and Nun in *Kanhabal*, *Qaranful*, and *Inqahl*, in that it is not for coordination (*Ilhaq*) but a new structure was united by it. As for *Ma'q* on the weight of *Qadin*, it is *Fa'il* inverted; its original is *Ma'iq*, so the Qaf was advanced over the Hamza becoming *Ma'qi*, and they made substitution necessary for it for lightening as was done with *Al-Dhurriyyah* and *Al-Dawiyyah* and the like. What testifies to this is what Abu Zayd narrated of lightening the Hamza in it, and that it is pluralized as *Mawaq* and *Mawaqi* both.\n\nVerse of Meaning\nBy Al-Ra'i:\n*She stayed in it during the intensity of spring, and her neighbor ... was a brother of solace (*Salwah*), the night spent the evening (*Massa*) with him, white and black (*Amlah*).*",

    "text": "His saying: \"Brother of solace (*Salwah*)\", he means the dew/moisture (*Nada*), meaning she was in a comfort of life that consoles them from others. He says: She stayed in this place in the strength of spring neighboring the dew. His saying: \"Massa bihi al-layl\" (The night spent the evening with him), i.e., joined the night. And \"Amlah\": White in black, and it is a description of the Brother of Solace. The meaning: She stayed as long as the dew helped her, then she departed.\n\nIssue of Syntax\nIf a speaker says: From where is it permissible to say: \"'Aman awwala\" (A year first/last year), and not permissible \"Shahran awwala\" (A month first), nor \"Yawman awwala\" (A day first), nor \"Sanatan ula\"? I say: Their saying: \"'Aman awwala\" is among what they intended for specificity with something that is not in others, relying on convention. Because the meaning is \"'Aman awwala min 'ami\" (A year first/before my year). When the word was circulated, and the need for its frequent use was pressing, they deleted, shortened, summarized, and limited, relying on the knowledge of the addressee, and the intention is completion. The difference between this and what is built on Damma, which is \"Abda'u bi-hadha awwalu\" (Start with this first), is that the one built on Damma has been made a limit implying the meaning of the deleted part, and it is fixed in intention. The one built [here] was not made the limit of speech nor implying the meaning of the annulled part of it; rather the limit of speech is what is in the soul. So it is in the status of what is spoken with it, even if deleted for lightening. It is as was deleted in the saying of the Rajiz:\n*He mixed from Salma the cartilages of a nose ('Rafa')*\nDo you not see that when he intended addition he said: \"Wafa\", so he deleted from the utterance and established it in the intention, until it became in the status of what is spoken. Had he intended singularity, only \"Faha\" would be permissible. Similar to this specification is their saying: \"Al-Yawma fa'altu kadha\" (Today I did such), making it for your day in which you are, and they do not say: \"I met him The Month nor The Year.\" They have also said: \"I met him *Al-'Am*\" (This year), even though *Al-'Am* means the year. The poet said:\n*O Year (*Al-'Am*) which has disturbed me ... You are the ransom like the mention of a year first/before (*'amin awwala*).*\nIf it is said: Why was *Min* needed such that you estimated in your saying \"'Aman awwala\" that its original is \"'Aman awwala min 'ami\"? I say: The speech only needed *Min* because they wanted to clarify in this *Af'al* (comparative/superlative) the beginning of the increase from what thing it was, to know its limit and start. So the meaning of your saying: \"Zaydun afdalu min Amrin\" (Zayd is better than Amr) is that the beginning of the increase of his merit is from the merit of Amr, so he is its limit and beginning. Likewise their saying: \"'Aman awwala\", so know it.\n\nIssue from the Tradition\nIt was narrated from Abdullah ibn Mas'ud that he said: \"Lengthening the prayer and shortening the sermon is a sign (*Ma'innah*) of the man's Fiqh.\" His saying: *Ma'innah*. Al-Farra said: It is said \"Anta 'umdatuna wa ma'innatuna\", i.e., we direct our needs to you. Its origin is: from *Anna fi al-amri ya'innu*, and *Dhanna yadhinnu*, if he hesitated in it and returned to accomplish its fulfillment. It is also said: *Annana* and *Dannana*. It was narrated from some of Banu Qays that he said: \"Ta'annantu fulanan\", in the meaning of: \"Tanas-saftuhu\", i.e., I sought justice from him for a claim I had against him. Al-Lihyani said: *Al-Ma'innah*: The status/place. He said:\n*Indeed applying Kohl to the pure white eye ... and looking at the arched eyebrow.*\n*Is a sign (*Ma'innah*) of the crooked deed.*\ni.e., *Madinnah* (Place of suspicion/location). Abu Zayd said: \"Innahu la-ma'innatun an yaf'ala kadha\", i.e., worthy/likely. Abu Malik said: \"The mosque is a *Ma'innah* from me,\" i.e., a place. Dukayn recited:\n*He is watered on a pricking pulley ... bound between squinting wells.*\n*A place (*Ma'innah*) of the perishing of souls.*\ni.e., a place of the destruction of souls. Al-Kisa'i: A man of the Bedouins, kunya Abu Zayd, attended me, and he was eloquent. He said: \"I see this assembly of yours is a *Ma'innah* for scholars,\" i.e., a mine. He recited:\n*So Tawdah of them, then Al-Qanan is a place (*Ma'innah*) ... then Thahlan of them is a spring camp and a summer one.*\nAbu Sa'id narrated: A man possessing *Ma'innah* entered, on the weight of *Ma'annah*, and men possessing *Ma'innah*, i.e., attracting good. Abu Malik recited regarding *Al-Ma'innah*:\n*And a dwelling of the love of Jumal I settled in ... a place (*Ma'innah*) of the observation points of places (*Ma'innat*).*\n\nChapter: Benefits and Subtleties\nAl-Asma'i: For stabbing, *Al-Wakhd* is that which if stabbed does not penetrate. *Al-Tasrid*: Penetrating stab. The Masdar from it is *Al-Sarad*. The poet said:\n*They did not spare me, you two left me ... but you feared the penetration (*Sarad*) of arrows.*\nIt is said: *Asradahu Isradan*. It is said: A stab and stabs *Nawajim* (appearing), which are those that if stabbed, a little of it penetrates from the other side; the horn and tooth *yanjumu* when it appears. It is said: *Wakhatahu Wakhatan*, if he stabbed a light stab resembling snatching. He said:\n*A snatch (*Wakhtan*) with a sharp [sword] in the kidneys, snatching.*\nIt is said: A stab *Lazz*, and a stab *Shazr*. *Al-Shazr* is what is from right and left. It is said in its like: If the matter is straight forward: *Sulka*, and *Ma Sulka*, and not *Makhluja*, and not *Sulka*. Imru' al-Qays said:\n*We stab them straight (*Sulka*) and crooked (*Makhluja*) ... your attack like an Amin upon a Nabil.*\ni.e., Archer.",

    "text": "Al-Asma'i used to say: They used to shoot in the past with two arrows, two arrows, then the two arrows would be returned to the archer. *Al-La'm* (with Hamza) is the arrow, and it is taken from *Al-Multa'im* (matching/meeting) in the feathers. Harithah ibn La'm is from this. The poet said:\n*People think of the two kings ... that they have united (*Ilta'ama*).*\n*If you permit their repair (*Laymihima*) ... then the matter has become grave.*\n*Al-Laym*: Reconciliation, named so because it is only from *Iltt'am* (uniting/healing).\nAl-Asma'i said: There are times the Arabs mention. Among them is the time of *Al-Fithal*. They say: That was the time of *Al-Fithal*, when the rocks were wet. Among them are the years of *Al-Fataq*. Ru'ba said:\n*It was not hoped for after the years of *Al-Fataq*.*\nThey only indicate by it the time of fertility and good. Among them are the times of *Al-Khunan*. This they indicate by it evil and calamities. Jarir said:\n*And I cauterize the lookers for *Al-Khunan*.*\nHe strikes it as a proverb, because the camel, if afflicted by *Al-Khunan* (a disease), his *Naziran* (two veins) are cauterized.\nAl-Asma'i said: *Al-Qirbah* is for water, *Al-Watb* is the skin for milk, *Al-Nihy* with Kasra on Nun is for ghee and thick juice (*Rubb*), and *Al-Ziqq*, which is pitched, is for wine and vinegar and the like.\nIt is said: What is the slippery rock on which the feet of scholars do not hold firm? It is said: Greed.\nHe said: Ibn Hubayrah used to seek refuge from snakes, the scorpion, and the 'Ilj (strong infidel/lout) if he became westernized (or strange/excessive).\nHe said: Bilal used to seek refuge from Satan and the Sultan.\nHe said: It is said of the horse's ear: As if it is a pod (*Sinf*) of a yellow Markh tree. *Al-Sinf*: A house (pod) that comes out at the base of the Rukh like the shape of fruit. If its fruit dries and falls from it, the *Sinf* remains hunched, hollow, pointed like the feather of an arrow, so the ear was likened to it.\nA man entered upon Mu'awiyah and asked him about his stipend. He said: Two thousand and five hundred dirhams. He said: What is the matter with the surplus (*'Ilawah*) between the two loads (*Fawdayn*)? So he removed the five hundred from his stipend and established two thousand for him. *Al-Fawdan*: Two large containers carried on the camel or beast, topped by another container below them placed between them. This is a proverb struck. *Al-Fawdan*: Also the two sides of the head.\nAl-Asma'i: It is said: *Al-Dafi'*: Water in the valley from the mountain or every high place. If it is a small push (*Daf'*) it is *Shu'bah*. If it is larger it is *Tal'ah*. If it exceeds that, it is *Maytha'*. He said: What is in the lowland is *Qariyy*. *Al-Midhnab*: If it pours into the meadow.\nAbu Zayd said: \"Ma lahu sa'nah wa la ma'nah\", i.e., he has neither little nor much. It is said: *Al-Sa'nah*: Grease/Fat. *Al-Ma'nah*: Kindness/Ma'un. The Ha may be deleted from them, so it is said: \"Ma lahu sa'n wa la ma'n\". And \"La 'afitah wa la nafitah\". *Al-'Afitah*: The ewe. *Al-Nafitah*: The nanny goat, which is the one that snorts with its nose. And \"Ma lahu sarih wa la ra'ih\". *Al-Sarih* is the one who goes early, and *Al-Ra'ih* is the one who returns. And \"Ma lahu haba' wa la raba'\". And \"Ma lahu zar' wa la dar'\". And \"Ma lahu thaghiyah wa la raghiyah\", meaning sheep and camel. And \"Ma lahu sabad wa la labad\". And \"Ma lahu khayr wa la mir\", from *marahum yamiruhum*. *Al-Haba'*: That which is born at the end of time. It is said: *'Afata* with his sheep *ya'fitu* *'aftan*.\nAl-Asma'i said: The *Khashib* sword to people is the polished one, but it is actually the one filed but not smoothed. It is said: Have you finished the sword? He says answering him: I have roughed it (*khashabtuhu*). Likewise arrows are roughed then smoothed (*tukhlaq*). So *Al-Khashb*: The first shaping. *Al-Takhliq*: Smoothing them upon finishing them. From it is the smooth rock (*Al-Safat Al-Khalqa'*). It is said: A sword *Mashquq al-Khashibah*, which is widening it when forging, then splitting it to make two swords from it. It is said: So-and-so roughs (*Yakhshubu*) poetry, i.e., passes it as it comes and happens, and does not refine it. Al-Ajjaj said:\n*And a shaft of Athal wood, he did not rough out (*ma takhashshaba*).*\nIt is said: *Takhashshaba* the Athal wood from it a shaft. *Al-Takhashshub* is not removing from the wood its branches and excesses. This is as it is said: He went out cutting branches (*yataqaddabu al-qudban*), and went out gathering truffles (*yatakamma'u al-kam'ah*).\nSome wise men of the Arabs said: \"The prayer of the penitent is when the young camels feel the heat (*tarmadu*).\"\nIt is said: So-and-so is *Mukhaddam* and So-and-so is *Muqaddam*. *Al-Mukhaddam* is the best of them in equipment and softest in living. *Qadama yaqdimu*, and *Khadama yakhdimu*.

    "text": "His Almighty's saying: (And when We intend to destroy a city, We command (*amarna*) its affluent ones but they defiantly disobey therein; so the word comes into effect upon it, and We destroy it with [complete] destruction) [Quran 17:16]. It is read: *Amarna* with lightening (no shadda). It can be from *Al-Amr* (command), the opposite of prohibition. And it can be in the meaning of \"We increased\". It is said: *Amartu* the thing *fa-amara*, i.e., I increased it so it increased. It came in the tradition: \"The best of wealth is a prolific mare (*muhrah ma'murah*) or a pollinated row of palms (*sikkah ma'burah*).\" And *Ammarna* with Tashdid (shadda) would be from *Al-Imarah* (authority) and empowerment. And *Amarna* with Madd (long A) would be in the meaning of \"We increased\" only. It is said: *Amara* the people and *Amara-hum* Allah, so the addition of Alif is for transfer and transitivity.\nMost people made the answer to *Idha* (When/If) *Amarna* according to its mentioned aspects. In every aspect there is a question. From that: If it is asked regarding *Amarna* with lightening: How is Allah Almighty's will to destroy a people permissible before He commands them and they counter His command with disobedience and wickedness? The answer: The mention of will (*Irada*) is metaphorical, and its reality is what preceded in His knowledge of their deserving destruction. This is as it is said: If the merchant intends his bankruptcy, he buys with cash and sells on credit; while it is apparent that there is no will from him for that. Another aspect is: If We intend in the future the destruction of a city, We command its affluent ones in the present, so they disobey; because on this [interpretation], what the questioner denied is removed from it.\nIt is asked regarding *Ammarna* with Tashdid: How is it permissible that they be destroyed and empowered *until* they disobey so they are destroyed? And is that anything but assistance from Allah Almighty in disobedience and wickedness and the necessity of destruction? The answer is that Allah Almighty empowers them to pour good upon them and bliss for them so they may be grateful and worship. If they oppose, become arrogant, rebellious, and wicked, they are only approached from their bad choice, and punished and destroyed for what they presented of their blameworthy actions. Similar question and answer apply to the reading of one who read *Amarna* with Madd and lightening.\nSome said: The answer to *Idha* is deleted, and His saying: (We command its affluent ones) along with what is conjoined to it is a description (Sifah). As if He said: If We intended that, it would be easy and not impossible.\nIt is said: The Fa' in His saying: *Fa-dammarnaha* (so We destroyed it) is extra, because it is the answer. The meaning: If We intended the destruction of a city whose description is that We commanded it with obedience so they disobeyed and the Word and Judgment became due upon it due to what preceded in Our knowledge of it and its bad destiny, We destroyed it. What indicates the permissibility of the extra Fa' is what Al-Akhfash narrated of the saying of some: \"Akhuka fa-wujida\" (Your brother, so he was found), meaning *wujida*, and the saying of the poet:\n*And if I perish, then at that, so grieve.*\nDo you not see that one of the two Fa's must be made extra.\nBetter than these aspects in my view and further from objection and criticism is to say: The Fa' in His saying: *Fa-dammarnaha* is the one with which the condition is answered, not the conjunction nor the extra one. That is because *Idha*, since it implies the meaning of conditionality (*Mujazah*), is answered with what *In* and its sisters are answered with, even if it does not operate their operation mostly. It is answered with Fa' because of what follows it of inchoative and predicate and verb. The Fa' was only needed because the answer differed from the condition. If the verb is narrated after the Fa', know that the inchoative is deleted, and were it not for that, the Fa' would not be needed. The future and past verbs in that are equal. Witness to that is the saying of Amr ibn al-Mukhlat:\n*Whoever has met envy from the meadow ... then for Qays in it there is a private [pasture] and a Cutter.*\nIf it is so, and His saying: *Amarna mutrafiha* with what is conjoined to it is a description for the city, then the estimation of the verse is: If We intended the destruction of a city commanded with obedience, disobedient, wicked, upon which the Word has become due, then We destroy it with destruction. Similar to that is the saying of Allah Almighty: (And whoever returns, then Allah will take retribution from him) [Quran 5:95], (And whoever disbelieves, then I will grant him enjoyment for a little) [Quran 2:126], (If a wound touches you, then a wound like it has touched the people) [Quran 3:140]. Do you not see that He raised the future verb after the Fa' because it is built on the inchoative, and if He wanted the answer to be with the verb, He would have dispensed with the Fa' and made the verb jussive. But the estimation is: Whoever returns, *then He*, Allah will take retribution from him. And whoever disbelieves, *then I* will grant him enjoyment for a little. And if a wound touches you, *then the matter and affair is*, a wound like it has touched the people. If the Fa' is from His saying: *Fa-dammarnaha*, then the answer: The verse is safe from the mentioned objections, and its path is easy, so know it, Allah willing.\n\nIssue from the Traditions\nIn the Hadith of Umm Zar', the fifth woman said: \"My husband, if he eats, he wraps (*laffa*); and if he drinks, he sips all (*ishtaffa*); and he does not insert the palm to know the grief (*bathth*).\" Abu Ubayd said: *Al-Laff* in eating is increasing in it with mixing of its types. *Al-Ishtifaf* in drinking is to exhaust what is in the vessel and leave no leftover (*su'r*) in it. Taken from *Al-Shafafah*, which is the remainder staying in the vessel of drink. It is said in the proverb: Quenching is not by sipping all (*Al-Tashaff*).",

    "text": "His saying: \"And he does not insert the palm to know the grief\": I think he found her a disease or defect which she was depressed about, because *Al-Bathth* is sadness, so as if he does not insert his hand into her clothes to touch the defect and expose her; she describes him with generosity. Abu Muhammad al-Qutaybi said: However, she has blamed him in the first two phrases, because she described him with gluttony and stinginess in them, and praised him in the third, because she described him with generosity. So how are they combined? I do not see the saying except what Ibn al-A'rabi said. He narrated it: \"My husband, if he eats he wraps, and if he drinks he sips all, and if he sleeps he wraps himself (*iltaffa*), and does not insert the palm so he knows the grief.\" He explained it saying: She meant that if he sleeps, he wraps himself aside and does not lie with her, and does not practice what a man practices with a woman if he wants to have intercourse with her, inserting the hand in her clothes and knowing the grief. There is no grief there other than the woman's love for her husband's closeness to her and her lying with him. So she alluded to that with *Al-Bathth* (grief), because the grief was because of it.\nAl-Qutaybi said: It is as a woman from Kinanah said to her husband reproaching him: \"Indeed your drinking is sipping all, and your lying down is falling down (*inji'af*), and your wrapping is wrapping up (*iltifaf*). And you are satiated a night you are hosted, and safe a night you fear.\" Similar is the saying of Aws:\n*And the moist north wind blew, and when ... the bedfellow of the young girl spent the night wrapped up.*\ni.e., wrapped up aside not lying with her. What I say is: What was objected to against Abu Ubayd regarding combining praise and blame in description according to what he explained is not objectionable. Because one who enumerates the traits of the described may combine what is praise and what is blame. This is as narrated from Luqman describing his brother: \"He gives the fat young she-camel, and there is no hesitation (*la'thamah*) in him, except that he is the son of a slave woman.\" Al-Qutaybi explained this in his book in the Hadith of the son of Ad, saying: *Al-Ta'la'thum* is pausing regarding a thing until he thinks about it. He meant there is nothing in his traits to pause about and from praising him for, except that he is the son of a slave woman. As for what he narrated from Ibn al-A'rabi, it is closer and more likely than what Abu Ubayd mentioned.\nBetter than both is to make the whole speech praise. The woman would be describing her husband with smoothness of nature, ease of side, and his preference in all his states for agreeing with his family and comforting them, being open with them, beautiful in their agreement, leaving disgust with them, showing finding everything they bring closer agreeable, and satisfaction with everything they do. Reaching towards the removal of reserve from between them in their eating together and sitting together, so his life and theirs is pleasant, and surveillance and fear are removed from their group. If he eats, he partakes of everything present and combines whatever is possible. If he drinks, he finishes the last of what he gulps in, and exhausts all that is in his vessel. If he retires, he does not seek what necessitates concern for him and brings grief upon him, so he sees him interlocking his fingers, undoing with his thought the paths of worries, and pressing by his tracking the joints of matters, to know the hidden grief, and repel the stray sadness. This is as you see.\nAs for the addition in Ibn al-A'rabi's narration, which is: \"If he sleeps he wraps himself (*iltaffa*)\", the intended meaning is the opposite of what was mentioned, which is that he sticks to his family embracing (*mutawashshihan*) them. It is said: So-and-so wore so-and-so (*irtada*) and wrapped himself with him (*iltaffa bihi*), if he embraced him and coiled with him. He said:\n*And both of us are wearing his companion ... like the wearing of the sword on the day of battle.*\nUways said:\n*As if a cat, led by side, is under her stirrup ... and a rooster wrapped around her legs and two sparrows.*\n\nChapter\nWhat came of generic nouns added in their speech to the names of their places and what runs their course of what they witness",

The majestic Sheikh Abu Ali Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan al-Marzuqi, may Allah prolong his grace, said:\nKnow that nouns which convey Inclusion and Generality have rulings, positions, and conditions. Among them are those which convey that definitively in a specific position, then if they leave that position—if they are capable of leaving—it is permissible that they convey it and are suitable for it, and permissible that they convey something else. Among them are those which are primarily to convey Singularity (*Wahdah*) and Isolation (*Infirad*), then if a word or state is conjoined with them, they convey Inclusion and Generality. Among them are those which convey by their wording the Genus (*Jins*) for which they were coined, then they turn to Singularity, and the turning is by a sign attaching to them and a change. Among them are those which convey Inclusion in Indefiniteness (*Tankir*) in one way, and convey it in Definiteness (*Ta'rif*) in another way, then neither takes the place of the other. Among them are those which convey Multiplicity (*Kathrah*), and their wording is the wording of the Singular, while formulated as a name for the Plural. Among them are those which convey Multiplicity and their wording is the wording of the Plural. Among them are those which convey Inclusion in the chapter of Negation and do not occur in Affirmation at all.\n\nThe First is what conveys Inclusion in a specific position. It divides into two parts:\nOne part adheres to that position and does not leave it, such as: *Kam* (How many/much), *Kayfa* (How), *Ayna* (Where), and *Mata* (When), because they adhere to the two positions of Ambiguity (*Ibham*), Interrogation (*Istifham*), and Condition (*Jaza'*). The occurrence of *Kam* in the Predicate (*Khabar*) does not infringe on what we mentioned, because it is more primary to Interrogation until it occurs in the Predicate if it occurs without a connection, so it remains on its limit in Interrogation regarding Ambiguity. We will clarify its state in the two chapters as needed in this place.\nAnother part leaves that position and transfers to another, and something conjoins with it in it which specifies it and removes Ambiguity from it, so it does not convey Inclusion and Generality. It may occur, with the specifier conjoined to it, conveying Multiplicity and Inclusion. That is like: *Man* (Who), *Ma* (What), and *Ayy* (Which). Do you not see that these nouns occur in the position of Ambiguity in the chapters of Condition and Interrogation in the same manner as the nouns that preceded in it, like: *Man 'indaka?* (Who is with you?), *Ma taf'alu?* (What are you doing?), *Man tadrib adrib* (Whoever you strike I strike), *Man tu'tihi ya'khudh* (Whoever you give takes), *Ayyuhum fi al-dar?* (Which of them is in the house?), and *Ayyuhum tukrim ukrim* (Whichever of them you honor I honor). So their ruling regarding Inclusion is the ruling of those. They also occur in the chapter of Predicate as relative pronouns (*Mawsulah*) clarified, or described (*Mawsufah*) limited. So it is more primary for them to signify the specified Singular in Indefiniteness. If they are described, something might also conjoin with them from which it is inferred that they convey Multiplicity and Inclusion. The first, though not needing an example due to its clarity, is like: *Ra'aytu man abuhu muntaliq* (I saw him whose father is leaving), *Ma sallamtuhu ila Zayd* (What I handed to Zayd), and *Ayyuhum fi al-dar* (Whichever of them is in the house). These are specialized by their relative clauses, definite in the meaning of *Alladhi*. And for the described indefinite like: *Rubba man ahsantu ilayhi asa'a ilayya* (Many a one whom I did good to did evil to me), because it means: *Rubba insan* (Many a human), and *Marartu bi-man zarifin* (I passed by a witty one), i.e., by a human. Likewise you say: *Marartu bi-ma salihin* (I passed by a good thing), i.e., by a good thing. His Almighty's saying: (This is what (*ma*) is with me, ready) [Quran 50:23] is interpreted that *Ma* in it is indefinite, and *Ladayya* is its adjective. Sibawayh said: This description is necessary for *Ma*, then he narrated it not described in Wonder (*Ta'ajjub*) and others, as if he means that is most of its states.",

    "text": "The Second is like His Almighty's saying: (And they worship other than Allah that which (*Ma*) does not harm them nor benefit them), then He said: (And they say, \"These are our intercessors with Allah\") [Quran 10:18]. And like His saying: (And they worship other than Allah that which (*Ma*) possesses not for them provision from the heavens and earth at all), then He said: (And they are not able) [Quran 16:73]. Do you not see that the context clarified its conveying Multiplicity? Ambiguous nouns have come like these. The nouns *Alladhi* (The one who) and its category is the Predicate, like His Almighty's saying: (And the one who (*Alladhi*) brought the truth), then He said: (Those are the righteous) [Quran 39:33]. And in His saying, Mighty and Majestic: (And among them are those who (*Man*) listen to you) [Quran 10:42], and this is very frequent.\nAs for the Second of the first division, which is what is primarily to convey Singularity and Isolation, then if a word or state conjoins with it, it conveys Inclusion and Generality, that is like: *'Ishruna dirhaman* (Twenty dirhams), *Ma ja'ani min rajulin* (No man came to me), *Hal ja'aka min khabarin* (Did any news come to you?), and like your saying: *Kullu insanin* (Every human), *Awwalu farisin* (First horseman), *Kullu rajulin* (Every man), and you say such. All this, its ruling in its original intent and coinage is to be for the Genus. Then by convention, it became primarily for the Singular, then what indicates its covering Multiplicity conjoined with it.\nAs for the Third: Which is what conveys by its wording the Genus for which it was coined, then turns to Singularity and Isolation by a sign attaching to it and a change. These are the Nouns of Actions (Verbal Nouns), like: *Al-Darb* (Beating), *Al-Darbah* (A beat), *Al-Insiraf* (Leaving), and *Al-Insirafah* (A departure). It is a condition of it and the condition of all generic nouns that they do not stop at little excluding much, nor much excluding little, except by indication.\nAs for the Fourth: Which is what conveys Inclusion in Indefiniteness in one way, and conveys it in Definiteness in another way, then neither takes the place of the other. Like your saying: *Kullu insanin* (Every human) says that. And like His Almighty's saying: (Indeed, mankind (*Al-Insan*) is in loss) [Quran 103:2]. And His saying, Mighty and Majestic: (Indeed, mankind (*Al-Insan*) was created anxious) [Quran 70:19]. And like your saying: *'Ishruna dirhaman* (Twenty dirhams), *'Ishruna dinaran*, *'Ishruna shatan* (sheep), *'Ishruna ba'iran* (camels). And like your saying: The Dinar and Dirham destroyed the people, and Sheep and Camel increased. Likewise: *Rubba sariqin* (Many a thief) was safe, and every sinner (*mudhnib*) and wicked person (*fasiq*) has his burden. And like His Almighty's saying: (The thief (*Al-Sariq*) and the female thief (*Al-Sariqah*)) [Quran 5:38]. And His saying: (The adulteress (*Al-Zaniyah*) and the adulterer (*Al-Zani*)) [Quran 24:2]. Do you not see that the definite of this section does not take the place of its indefinite, and likewise its indefinite does not take the place of the definite. And it is not like your saying: *Mi'atu dirhamin* (A hundred dirhams), and *Mi'atu al-dirhami* (A hundred of the dirham). And like your saying: He gives *Khazzan* (silk) and *Qazzan* and *Dirhaman* and *Dinaran*, and *Al-Khazz* and *Al-Qazz* and *Al-Dirham* and *Al-Dinar*. There was from it *Darban* and *Shatman*, and *Al-Darb* and *Al-Shatm*.\nAs for the Fifth: Which is what conveys Multiplicity and its wording is the wording of the Singular. These are nouns formulated for a Plural, like: *Kull* (All) from *Juz'* (Part) and *Ba'd* (Some). Like: *Qawm* (People) from *Rajul*, *Nisa'* (Women) from *Imra'ah*, *Ibil* (Camels) from *Naqah* and *Jamal*, and *Ula'i* (Those) from *Dha*. The second: That it be from the wording of the Plural with the singular noun formulated for Multiplicity. That is like: *Al-Jamil* from *Jamal*, *Al-Baqir* from *Baqar*, and like: *Al-Da'in* and *Al-Kalib*, from *Da'n* and *Kalb*.\nAs for the Sixth: Which is what conveys Multiplicity and its wording is the wording of the Plural. That is like sound plurals, like: *Al-Muslimun* and *Al-Muslimat*. And broken plurals, like: *Al-Fujjar* and *Al-Fussaq*. The structures of these plurals have details and rulings we will reach and detail. In general, they do not convey Inclusion and Multiplicity except after being stripped of what restricts them to numbers and specifies them.\nAs for the Seventh: Which is what conveys Inclusion in the chapter of Negation and does not occur in Affirmation at all. That is like their saying: *Ma fi al-dari dayyar* (There is no one in the house), *Ma biha turiyy*, and *Ma biha safir*. Do you not see that you do not say: *Biha safir*, *Biha turiyy*, and *Biha dayyar*. This is some detailing of that summary, and we will busy ourselves now with clarifying it and mentioning the evidences in it, Allah Almighty willing.",

    "text": "Know that what indicates that *Kam* (How many) is coined for Generality and Inclusion is that it is used to ask about numbers. When asked with it about a counted thing, the addressee is compelled to answer about the little of that questioned thing and the much of it, such that if he falls short, he has no excuse to say that the number of what you asked about is such and such, and your question did not cover [it]. Were it not that *Kam* encompasses every number, the state of the addressee when he wanted to answer would not be compelled to mention the number of the questioned thing definitively. Likewise is the state of *Kayfa* (How) regarding conditions (*Ahwal*), because it is used to ask about them. There is no condition for the questioned thing except *Kayfa* encompasses it, such that the addressee has nothing to cling to if he sends down the answer.\nIf it is said: How do you claim that for *Kayfa*, when we know that if a speaker said to another: \"How are you?\" and he started saying: \"Washed of clothes, clean of body,\" and similar conditions of his, he [the speaker] would have the right to say: \"I did not ask you about any of this.\" If the matter is so, how is the word *Kayfa* encompassing for asking about all conditions? And if it is encompassing, how can he say: \"I did not ask you about anything of what you mentioned\"? It is said to him: What you mentioned does not indicate that *Kayfa* is not encompassing for all conditions. That is because the convention of interlocutors is that if one asks the other about himself with the word *Kayfa*, he needs to consider which of his conditions the questioner intended, so he informs him about the condition of that questioned thing excluding others, because he is compelled [to understand] that he did not ask him about all his conditions. If the word *Kayfa* encompassed them by coinage, then what he did not ask him about became like the excepted from their totality. A thing becomes excepted by wording, and becomes excepted by custom (*'Urf*), reason (*'Aql*), and Sharia (*Shar'*). If the matter is so, and there is no condition of the conditions of that convention between them except that it is valid to be asked about with the word *Kayfa*, and it is permissible that he intends it, and it is not excepted by custom and reason, then its encompassing of all of them is established by this evidence, and what the questioner asked falls by what we mentioned and clarified that it is like the excepted, so know it.\nIf it is said: What do you deny that *Kayfa* covers [only] that which you claimed is the intent of the questioner and the questioned, which needs to be intended for answer after contemplating and understanding it, not others. And that your saying: \"It covers everything by coinage originally, and the extra is like the excepted\" is corrupt? It is said: What you mentioned does not impugn the evidence. We reveal what we mentioned by what supports the evidence and drops the question, which is that we found the affirmation with what is indefinite (*Nakirah*), like *Salih* (Good) and *Mu'afa* (Healed), and what runs this course. If the question were about a specific thing, its answer would come out in the manner of definites (*Ma'arif*). In the fact that its answer only comes indefinite is an indication that what you mentioned was not intended by it upon coinage. What reveals what we mentioned is that the definite was prevented from being in the answer to *Kayfa*—so it is said: *Al-Salih* and *Al-Mu'afa*—because the speech would exit to being an answer to a question about essences (*Dhat*) not about their conditions. If the questioner about conditions with *Kayfa* intended to ask about a specific thing among them, the ruling of that thing in specification would be the ruling of the essence, so its answer would come definite, but its answer only comes indefinite. If the matter is as we mentioned, just as it is not permissible for its answer to be definite because it exits in the question to covering the essence, likewise in the condition (*Hal*) it is not permissible that it covers a specific thing among them, because that necessitates its answer be definite.\nBy such a method we clarify the state of *Ayna* (Where) in places, and *Mata* (When) in times, this is in the chapter of Interrogation. As for *Kam* and *Kayfa*, they have no entry in Condition (*Jaza'*). And *Ayna* and *Mata*, their state in Condition is like their state in Interrogation. As for *Kam* in the Predicate (*Khabar*), it remains on its ambiguity, due to what we mentioned that the chapter of Interrogation is more primary for it, evidenced by the fact that it was not connected in it, even though it is a chapter of clarification and explanation, as was done with its sisters in it. If a speaker says: \"Kam rajulin akramtuhu\" (How many a man I honored), its meaning is many men. The multiplicity he refers to does not reach the limit of inclusion for the whole genus, even if he is not stopping at a specific amount. For this reason, it was permitted to be added to the singular and the plural, so it is said: \"Kam rajulin\" and \"Kam rijalin\". In Interrogation, it is only specified by the generic noun in singular form. This multiplication we described, he accompanied it to the Predicate, because that is effective in it inevitably. Do you not see that it is objectionable in reason that the speaker of \"Kam rajulin akramtuhu\" honored the entire genus? If the chapter were the chapter of Negation or Interrogation or Condition, that would not be objectionable. This is revealed by the slightest contemplation, so know it.",

    "text": "What indicates that *Man* (Who) and *Ma* (What), which are the second category of what conveys Inclusion, convey Inclusion in the position we mentioned, which is Ambiguity in the chapters of Condition and Interrogation, are evidences from what we inferred in the first type: That the questioned is compelled in the genus he was asked about to answer, such that he has no escape by claiming the questioner's wording covered such and such, excluding such and such. Here the place becomes clear by contemplating the motives that called for coining these words. It is that they looked into what they ask about of conditions, times, places, numbers, genera, and rational beings, and found themselves with the questioned in a state that necessitated upon them formulating comprehensive, encompassing words. Otherwise, the questioned could deviate from answering what he is asked about, even if the questioner burdened himself with many matters and elaborated speech that tired him and was difficult for him. Do you not see that the questioner about a counted number imagining it with others of a genus, if he said to him: Is such with you of this genus or such or such, until he multiplied names of numbers, and exhausted times in that, he would not be safe from what is with him being less than the numbers we mentioned or more than them. Likewise here in conditions, if he enumerated many conditions in a specific questioned object, he would not be safe from it being on others. Likewise in times, if we mentioned many times of past and future, he would not be safe with the extension of times that the questioned object is in others, so his answer would not come out according to his intent. Likewise in rational beings, if he mentioned most of whom he knows, he would not be safe from it being others. This, and a human has been asked about what he does not know, just as he is asked about whom he knows. Mentioning whom he knows is impossible in the manner we mentioned. As for whom he does not know, it is impossible that he mentions him. Since the matter is like this, they resorted to formulating words sufficient from prolongation, comprehensive of genera, compelling to the questioned, such that if they wanted the answer, [they would have] no ending to the intent. In that is evidence for the position he wants to indicate of the inclusion of these words for what they were coined for, and their encompassing what is not hidden.\nAmong them is that when the questioned hears these words, if he considers, he does not find in the genera he is asked about with them a cause except that it is fit to be an answer to the questioner, if he intends it and makes it an answer. Were it not for the inclusion of these words for the genera they were coined for [and] their encompassing, it would not be valid in every [part] and some of it to be an answer. If this evidence is objected to by saying that whoever says: \"Man dakhala dari akramtuhu\" (Whoever enters my house I honor him) in Condition, that the thief is not permitted to be intended; and if he said: \"Man dakhala dari ahantuhu\" (Whoever enters my house I insult him), it is not permitted that the angel/king be intended. And likewise what runs this course. The answer to it is that the word covers the whole in the origin of coinage, and what exited from it by reason or custom or Sharia, is as if it was extracted from it by exception. Do you not see that if he said: \"Whoever enters my house is held accountable,\" or: \"Whoever enters my house is rewarded or punished,\" and He said: \"Allah created whoever (*Man*) is in the heavens and earth,\" or \"what (*Ma*) is in the heavens and earth,\" every worshipper and existent of Jinn and Angel and others would enter under this, if the speaker is one who knows that worship includes these genera, likewise reward and punishment and creation. Were it not that the word is comprehensive, the rulings of reports and promises and what is guaranteed for them would change, and reporting in these words that are used in these places. You knew that the origin of coinage in them is what we mentioned, nothing else.\nAmong them is the permissibility of excepting the excepted from them whatever he wished, reaching whatever it reached in fewness and abundance. Were it not for the inclusion of these words and their encompassing, exception from them would not be permissible to the limit we mentioned. This is not impugned by the saying of the sayer: That with exception it is as if it was coined for that which it indicates. Nor his saying: It did not convey Inclusion in a way, because according to you it is not free from exception, or what runs the course of exception of custom and reason. Because whoever considers what the word conveys in its isolation, and upon exception from it what the exception conveys in it, and were it not for exception how the state of the word would be—it becomes clear to him that this question is fallen. Likewise whoever considers that the word and its coinage is one thing, and the dominance of custom, reason, and Sharia over it is another thing, occurring upon it after the convention on it, just as exception from it by word is after convention on it.\nKnow that his saying: \"It never conveyed Inclusion\" is corrupt, because the word must be precedent to what it was coined for, to custom and reason both, because these two dominate it like the domination of the word specifying it afterwards.",

    "text": "If it is said: What do you deny that reason at the time of coinage dominates it just as custom and word dominate later? It is said to him: If reason dominates in the place you pointed to, it would prevent coining the name for it from the start. Whenever the coiner intends coinage with the prevention of reason from it, he is like one undertaking an impossibility, or playing with what he coins. If the matter is like this, and reason does not prevent nor forbid, an encompassing name is coined for it. Rather, how would it forbid when the need touches upon it as we clarified? So it must be that the convention has occurred with it, and that reason dominated after the coinage so it specified, just as custom dominates after it, and as the word dominates after it. In this, for one who looks carefully, is sufficiency.\nAmong them is that words were only coined according to the need for them. We have known that one of us, just as he intends to report about sensed individuals, likewise he intends to report about known genera, and attaches the intended [meaning] to them as he attaches it to singulars. If the matter is so, there must be in their speech what conveys the genus, including it, encompassing it; otherwise, the deficiency of the Arabic language regarding meanings occurring in the soul would appear. Even if it must be that their need for what they express is like our need, and their motives like our motives. If the matter is so, and the intention from us to report about the genus with a word comprehensive of all of them is valid, then likewise their matter must be like our matter. If their matter is like our matter, there must be in their language what conveys that in reality not metaphorically, and this is in the nouns we mentioned.\nBy this which we mentioned, the saying of one who claims that it is not impossible that words are suitable for Inclusion without being conveying of it in reality, restricted to it, falls. It is supported by the fact that we found these nouns conveying these genera in the places we pointed to by way of regularity in them. Among the signs of what is reality in a thing is its regularity in it and its continuity. If these words are continuous in conveying these genera in the ways we mentioned, they must be reality for them.\nThese evidences we mentioned contain what indicates conveying Inclusion and Generality in *Man* and *Ma* if they transfer from the place of Ambiguity to the chapter of Clarification and Explanation, which is the chapter of Predicate (*Khabar*) also. That is the permissibility of exception from us in the way we clarified, and the validity of intention attaching from us to what conveys Inclusion and Generality if we wanted reporting about a genus, and that their way is like our way, and that there must be in their speech what conveys that in reality, otherwise the language would be deficient from what was occurring in their souls then, and in our souls now. This is the state of *Man* and *Ma*, and they are for Encompassing.\nAs for *Ayy*, it is for a part of a whole. Although it is not specific to some over some, but each of them is valid by way of substitution and according to what is estimated as a part of the totality, it does not convey Encompassing. Due to the intensity of its ambiguity, addition became necessary for it. The meaning of ambiguity in it is that it is not specific to a genus over a genus, just as each of *Man* was specific. Do you not see that you do not intend a genus? *Ayy* is used in the general, so it is more inclusive than *Man* and *Ma* in this aspect, and below them in what it conveys of Encompassing.\nAs for what is primarily to convey Singularity and Isolation, then if a word or state conjoins with it, it conveys Inclusion and Generality, like their saying: \"Ishruna dirhaman\" (Twenty dirhams), \"Ma ja'ani min rajulin\" (No man came to me), \"Hal ja'aka min khabarin\" (Did any news come to you?), \"La rajula fi al-dar\" (There is no man in the house). And like your saying: \"Kullu insanin\" (Every human), \"Awwalu farasin\" (First horse), and what resembles this. These indefinite nouns convey Encompassing by what conjoined with them of words before them, since they and their likes were made by custom and usage such that conveying Singularity by themselves is more primary, even if they were coined for units and above. Here in these nouns is like the mark and change in verbal nouns. What indicates that is that *Min* in your saying: \"Ma ja'ani min rajulin\", and \"Hal 'indaka min shay'in\", is not permissible to enter upon a specific singular. You do not say: \"Ma ja'ani min Zaydin\" (No Zayd came to me). Were it not that it conveys in *Rajul*—when conjoined with it in your saying: \"Ma ja'ani min rajulin\", \"Hal ja'aka min khabarin\", \"Hal 'indaka min shay'in\"—Multiplicity and Inclusion, it would not be prevented from entering upon the specific singular as well. Since it was prevented from it, and your saying *Rajul* is either that the intended by it is one of a tribe unspecified, or the Tribe as it is,",

    "text": "And we have known from their language and intent that they do not mean negation of an unspecified one in their saying: \"Ma ja'ani min rajulin\" (No man came to me), so nothing remains except that it conveys negation of the Tribe as it is encompassing the nouns. You, if you said: \"Ma ja'ani rajulun\" without *Min*, it is more primary that you intend by it negation of an unspecified one. Likewise your saying: \"Ishruna rajulan\" (Twenty men); your saying \"Ishruna\" alerted that the intent is the whole Genus, since it is not permissible that it conveys an unspecified one along with the conjunction of Twenty with it due to the corruption entering the meaning, and because it is apparent that the intended by \"Twenty men\" is twenty from the men, and from the Tribe which is Men. Likewise if you said: \"Kullu rajulin\" (Every man), *Kull* clarifies that *Rajul* afterwards is general for the Genus. Likewise your saying: \"Hal 'indaka min ahadin\" (Is there anyone with you), *Ahad* is in the meaning of Plural evidenced by the fact that it is not permissible to occur for one, if the intent by which it is valid in non-one is not valid in one, unless there is a position where a benefit close to what we mentioned in non-one is obtained, like the sayer's saying: \"Ja'ani al-yawma kullu ahadin\" (Everyone came to me today), because this, even if it conveys Multiplicity, does not convey Encompassing. It is as we mentioned regarding *Kam* if it transfers from the chapter of Interrogation to the chapter of Predicate.\nIf it is said: Why do you not say: \"Ja'ani 'ishruna wahidan\" (Twenty ones came to me), because what is after Twenty is only in the meaning of Plural according to your claim? It is said to him from before: Twenty and its likes is a specific number needing clarification of the counted upon which the count fell, and that is what generic nouns convey, and *Ahad* is not among them. We have clarified that these nouns, when they exceed the position in which they convey Singularity and Isolation, turn to the Genus, and there must be conjunction of what conveys it.\nIf it is said your saying: \"Kullu rajulin\" and \"Kullu insanin\", is it permissible that the definite generic noun take the place of the indefinite here, because each of them conveys the benefit of its companion according to your claim, and be like your saying: \"Mi'atu dirhamin\" and \"Mi'atu al-dirhami\" if you intended Definition? It is said: No. But if Definition is intended in your saying: \"Kullu rajulin\", you say: \"Kullu al-rijali\", and in \"Kullu insanin\", \"Kullu al-nasi\". And \"Kullu insanin\" (Every the human) and \"Kullu al-rajuli\" (Every the man) is not permissible. That is because: \"Kullu rajulin\" is in the meaning of: \"Kullu ahadin\" (Everyone), and its summary is: All men, if they were man by man, on the limit of your saying: \"Kullu ithnayni\" i.e.: All people, if they were two by two. And like your saying: \"Huma khayru ithnayni fi al-nasi\" (They are the best two in people), i.e.: They are the best of people, if they were two by two. If you intended Definition, it exits from this, because such estimation is not possible in it [leading] to your saying: \"Kullu al-rijali\", \"Kullu al-nasi\", and there is no other. And \"Mi'atu rajulin\", *Ahad* does not take its place due to what we clarified in our saying: \"Ishrina\" and their likes. When you added the Hundred to *Rajul*, and you had finished with the number so you needed the Category, you defined what was indefinite, so you said: \"Mi'atu al-dirhami\". In this is a clear distinction between: \"Mi'atu dirhamin\" and its tribe, and between \"Kullu ahadin\" and its tribe, so understand it.\nIf it is said: Why did you prevent \"Kullu al-rajuli\", while Allah Mighty and Majestic says: (All food (*Kullu al-ta'ami*) was lawful to the Children of Israel) [Quran 3:93]? I say: This question is a mistake or fallacy, because Food in its inclusion of types is like People (*Al-Nas*) in its inclusion of types. We have permitted saying: \"Kullu al-nasi\", and we only prevented saying: \"Kullu rajulin\" and \"Kullu al-rajuli\". We have indicated it with what is sufficient, so know it.\nAs for their saying: \"Ahkaka al-nasu al-dinara wa al-dirhama\" (People destroyed the Dinar and the Dirham), this is not among what relies in conveying Multiplicity on something before it, as we mentioned in indefinites. But whenever it is stripped of what specifies it, it must be covering the Genus, encompassing it, and indicating that Alif and Lam are for Definition and Specification. The Specified Defined, just as it can be sensed, perceived, familiar, it can be known, rational. Alif and Lam refer to specifying that defined [noun] according to what is valid to specify it with. If it is familiar, perceived, sensed, the reference by Alif and Lam is to defining it in that way. And if it is known, rational, the reference by it is to defining it in that way. Our saying: *Rajul* is either that the intended by it is one of the Genus unspecified, or the Genus as it is. Likewise if Alif and Lam enter it and what specifies it with a specific familiar does not conjoin with it, it must convey the second position which belongs to it of the two positions, which is the Genus as it is. It is inferred that your saying: \"Ahlaka al-nasu al-dinara wa al-dirhama, wa kathura al-sha'u wa al-ba'iru\" (People destroyed the Dinar and Dirham, and Sheep and Camel increased) - the intended by it is Generality and Multiplicity - from what preceded of the permissibility of excepting the group from this singular noun in wording. Likewise the second indication from the need to attach the intended to the generic noun conveying Generality.",

    "text": "If it is said: If the indefinite conveys that as you claimed before, then what is the benefit of this definition? It is said to him: The intent in it is referring to what is established in the soul and understood of knowledge of types. The Dirham in this or similar is not like a single one you knew and knew sensed, then pointed to it, because knowledge of types from this perspective is impossible, and it is not permissible that any of us knows types sensed, as some individuals are known so. Since the matter is so, and it is not impossible in their language that the indefinite word provides what the definite provides, and the definite provides like what the indefinite provides by conjunction of indicators, likewise what we mentioned in generic nouns is not impossible, that their indefinite conveys like what their definite conveys by conjunction of indicators. So if it is definite, its wording accords with its conveyed meaning. If it is indefinite, it only clarifies what is clarified from it and its indicators that brought it to that limit.\nAs for the saying of one who says: Alif and Lam convey Genus, and its estimation is that it was coined in the language for that, it is ignorance of language and art, because Alif and Lam, their benefit is nothing but Definition. Our saying: \"Alif and Lam\" is leniency from us and running on the habit of grammarians, because the Lam is what was coined for Definition only. The Alif with it is Hamzat al-Wasl, so know it.\nIf it is said: How did you claim that Alif and Lam in the like of this definition enter what conveys Multiplication without Singularity, while you say: \"Kharajtu fa-ra'aytu al-asada\" (I went out and saw the lion), and its definition is that definition, while you do not intend Multiplication nor Encompassing, but the intent is: I went out and saw the one of this genus, without specification or particularization? I say: This was only permitted in this type of singulars due to its resemblance to the Type in that it is not familiar by sense, just as the Type is not so. As if you placed the Genus in place of the Singular due to the name falling on it like its falling on the Genus, and because the General is used in place of the Specific, like their saying: \"Asiru 'alayhi al-abada\" (I march on it forever), while the intent is: I march on it, much. Since the matter is so, it is like a thing borrowed from its chapter for other than its chapter. Similar to it is what is used of the plural wording in place of the singular. Do you not see that it is good to say to one who owned a slave, or gave a dinar: \"Sira tamliku al-'abida wa tahabu al-dananira\" (You became owning slaves and giving dinars), even if what he owned or gave was only one. Just as you permit with plural, likewise you permit with generic noun, defined in the unspecified singular, even if that is of the benefit of indefinites. Do you not see that there is no difference between his saying: \"Kharajtu fa-ra'aytu al-asada\" and his saying: \"Kharajtu fa-ra'aytu asadan\", except what you see of definition. Yes, it is possible to say: If it were said: \"Kharajtu fa-ra'aytu asadan\", the listener might allow following his saying *asadan* with an adjective of adjectives. So if the speaker falls silent and does not follow it with the adjective, it becomes clear to him later that his intent was one of the genus unspecified and undescribed. If it were said: \"Kharajtu fa-ra'aytu al-asada\", the listener would know that the intent is the one of the genus and would not wait for the adjective that is permissible to come with the indefinite. This may be among the benefits of what has Alif and Lam. In any case, definition did not increase specification that was not in indefiniteness. The indefinite that conveys the benefit of definites refers by it to indefinites limited by descriptions and conditions, until it runs the course of pointing to the meaning, like your saying: \"Fina rajulun 'alayhi darra'atun sha'nuhu kadha\" (Among us is a man wearing a coat whose affair is such), and there is no one in the group wearing a coat other than him. The definite that conveys the indefinite is other than your saying: \"Mithluka shibhuka, hasanu al-wajhi\" (Your like is your resemblance, beautiful of face), because this is from the perspective of wording, not because of the ambiguity presented in the position. If you say instead of your saying: \"Fina rajulun 'alayhi darra'atun\", \"Fina Zaydun aw Abu Fulanin aw ghulamuka\" (Among us is Zayd or Abu Fulan or your servant), and in the group the name of each one of them or his description or his Kunya is like that name or description or Kunya, the benefit of the definite—if the matter is so—would be the benefit of the indefinite.",

    "text": "If it is said to him: You claimed that if Alif and Lam enter the generic noun, and it is stripped of what specifies it, it is encompassing and inclusive. What do you deny that the intended by it is the Tribe and the Genus unspecified? Likewise, it is valid to intend the Genus without wanting Encompassing. If it is so, its turning to Encompassing needs an evidence conjoining with it conveying that in it. Otherwise, due to its emptiness of what conveys Specification in it, it only exits to conveying the Genus merely. I say: Whoever contemplates generic nouns, how they were formulated, and why they were coined, dispenses with this question by that. That is because they only intended to distinguish genera from each other in coining names for them, just as they intended to distinguish individuals. They coined [them] with the condition that it covers the One to wherever it ends and reaches, and sufficed for it with that name in distinguishing it from what differs from it. Therefore, they did not pluralize it nor dualize it, because they formulated it with the condition that it conveys what it was coined for, whatever amount it reaches, and however it increases or decreases. A thing is only valid to be dualized and pluralized if it is restricted, evidenced by the fact that dualization is adding a thing to its like, and pluralization is adding a thing to its likes or similars. If this addition which we pointed to is not valid except in what has stopped [is limited], then this meaning is not valid in the generic noun. If the state of the generic noun is this state, whenever nothing conjoins with it specifying it to some of what it was coined for, it must be inclusive of all of it, encompassing, because its coinage is on that. How can it convey the Genus as it is, and not be encompassing of it? If that is according to what we mentioned, there is no meaning to the sayer's saying: It conveys the Genus without Encompassing, because that is imaginable in the position where one says this: If the intended meaning attaches to part of the Genus, and for other than that part is the name of the Genus. That is not known except by indication, just as Isolation and Specification are not known except by indication.\nIf it is said: Do you not permit saying: \"Place this money in this Genus,\" pointing by it to men, and not intending All and Encompassing? If that is permissible in its wording *Al-Jins*, what denies that it be permissible in the generic noun also? I say: His saying: \"Place this money in this Genus\" is specified by custom. Therefore he was commanded to spend it on some of the Genus not all of it. Because it is not in custom that the One covers the Genus, as it is by connection or command. If it is so, were it not for the customary specification we mentioned, their saying: \"The Genus\" would include all of them. If the state of the word *Al-Jins* is this state, likewise the state of the generic noun is this state; whenever it is stripped of what specifies it from custom, Sharia, reason, or word, it is only inclusive, so know it.\nFrom this category is their saying: \"Awwalu farisin\" (First horseman), because by the entry of *Awwal*, *Faris* exited from conveying what is more primary to it of Singularity and Isolation, and became conveying Inclusion and Generality. On that is His Mighty and Majestic saying: (And do not be the first disbeliever (*awwala kafirin*) in it) [Quran 2:41]. For this reason, Al-Akhfash interpreted it as meaning: The first who disbelieved in it. Others said: Its meaning is: First group disbelieving in it. The difference between the two ways is that Al-Akhfash made it encompassing, so he put *Man* in its place as if the intended was: And do not be the first of disbelievers in it when it becomes disbeliever by disbeliever. Others made it on another way, so they diverted it to a group of the Tribe unknown, as if he said: First of disbelievers in it if they became group by group. Most of our Basran companions are on the method of Abu al-Hasan al-Akhfash, and it is not correct, as we indicated and clarified, because claiming the deletion of *Fariq* and setting up *Kafir*, which is its adjective, in its place, needs evidence.\nFrom this category is their saying: \"Rubba rajulin\" (Many a man), and \"Kam rajulin\" (How many a man), because *Rajul* by the entry of *Kam* and *Rubba* upon it became conveying Multiplicity and encompassing. What indicates that to you is that *Kam* conveys Multiplication of what it enters upon without end, and *Rubba* conveys Minimization of it unconfined. But based on what the informer sees of the littleness of the thing and its abundance. Were it not that *Rajul* after them is for Encompassing, the entry of either of them upon it would not be valid. How does the Much which has no known end emerge, except from the word which conveys Encompassing? And likewise the Little which is on the limit we mentioned.\nFrom this category are the active and passive participles like their saying: *Al-Kafir* (Disbeliever), *Al-Sariq* (Thief), *Al-Zani* (Adulterer), *Al-Muslim* (Muslim), *Al-Mu'min* (Believer).",

    "text": "Know that their saying: *Al-Fasiq* and *Al-Zani* is placed in the position of: *Alladhi fasaqa* (He who sinned) and *Zana* (committed adultery), and the Alif and Lam in it mean *Alladhi*. This is because the verb, since it was not coined for Specification, but was coined to be a useful predicate only, was prevented from what its occurrence would be for Specification like Addition (*Idafa*) and Alif and Lam. But just as they made it, I mean the verb, part of the completion of *Alladhi*, they loved that Specification covers it also, so they transferred it to the active participle. They intended by Alif and Lam in it—even if its coming in the origin of speech is for Specification only—the meaning of *Alladhi* which the verb used to carry in the relative clause of *Alladhi*, so Alif and Lam would be completed by the active participle as that [relative clause] was completed by the verb. Just as *Alladhi*, if not conjoined with what specifies it to a specific one, turns to the Genus, so what indicates its encompassing and inclusion is what indicates in the generic noun; there is no difference between them. Its matter is close to its implication of the meaning of Condition (*Jaza'*), such that it is answered with what Condition is answered with of Fa'. Just as Condition with Ambiguity, where the ruling of the noun used in it became what we clarified and evidenced—which is *Man* and *Ma*—likewise is the ruling of the active and passive participle, evidenced by His Almighty's saying: (The thief (*Al-Sariq*) and the female thief (*Al-Sariqah*), cut off their hands) [Quran 5:38], in the status of his saying had he said: Whoever steals, cut off his hand. Abu al-Abbas al-Mazini narrated that the active participle is entered by Alif and Lam conveying Definition only; its entry upon it is like its entry upon the generic noun, when you say: *Al-Rajul*. This, even if it is a disagreement from our companions, has no entry in what we are in.\nIf it is said: I see you turning your speech regarding Alif and Lam on [the basis] that it has two places: One is definition of Familiarity (*'Ahd*), and the second is definition of Genus. Yet you may say: \"Hadha al-rajulu fa'ala kadha aw kadha\" (This man did such or such) without there being familiarity regarding him between you and the addressee. So if you were [saying] by his saying and no familiarity [existed], and it is apparent that your saying: \"Hadha al-rajulu\" does not intend the Genus, why didn't you say: It has a third place, which is your saying: \"Hadha al-rajulu\" and \"Tilka al-mar'atu\", while you point to two present ones, one by distance and the other by proximity. I say: *Al-Rajul* and *Al-Mar'ah* were transferred by what accompanied them of the demonstrative noun to the present. They are originally for the Genus. It is not impossible for what is for the Genus to have something conjoin with it making it for one of the Genus, because the generic noun encompasses the One to infinity, so know it.\nFrom this category is their saying: \"Ni'ma al-rajulu Zaydun\" (Excellent is the man, Zayd), and \"Habbadha Zaydun\" (Beloved is Zayd), because *Dha* is like *Al-Rajul*. *Al-Rajul* is a generic noun. The meaning: Zayd is praised in his tribe. Except that it is not encompassing, evidenced by the fact that it is dualized and pluralized, so it is said: \"Ni'ma al-rajulani al-Zaydani\", \"Ni'ma al-rijalu al-Zayduna\". If it were encompassing, its dualization would not be valid. Neither is the saying of the sayer: \"Zayd is praised among men,\" and if they became man by man, correct. Nor is the saying: \"It is for a specific one\" correct, because the occurrence of *Rajul* in the place of *Ahad* so that it covers the units of the Genus by way of substitution only happens in the indefinite. As for when it becomes definite, it does not convey unity. Therefore we did not say: \"Kullu al-rajuli\", nor: \"Kullu al-insani\", and the evidence for that has passed. Nor is it permissible that it be for a specific one, because if it were so, what conveys Specification of proper nouns and others would not be prevented from occurring in its place, due to their equality in conveying a specific one. In the prevention of that is evidence that it is for the Genus not for the specific one.\nIf it is said: Then *Al-Rajul* from your saying: \"Ni'ma al-rajulu\", to which aspect do you direct it if you do not make it encompassing? I say: The praiser as if he knew Zayd and his likes, or knew him and his tribe which he is from, so he wanted praise to cover him while he is preferred over them. So he borrowed the word of the Genus for some of them. Its dualization and pluralization became indicative of his intent, because when he took *Al-Rajul* to be restricted to his likes or his tribe which he is from, it became specific or standing at a number, so it became capable of dualization and pluralization. As if when we said: \"Ni'ma al-rajulani al-Zaydani\", we said: The two Zayds are praised in their two tribes. Each tribe of the two tribes is different from the other, even if in one aspect, because the similarity of two things, each one of them to the other in every aspect, is corrupt and not permissible. It has been known from the principles of language and the saying of our grammarian companions: That generic nouns are dualized and pluralized if they differ. His Almighty's saying: (Nay, His hands (*yadahu*) are outstretched) [Quran 5:64] has been interpreted as dualization of the Genus, as if two genera of blessing, the blessing of the world and the Hereafter, or the blessing of religion and the world.\nFrom this category is their saying: \"Qalla rajulun yaqulu dhaka\" (Rarely does a man say that), and \"Aqalla rajulin yaqulu dhaka\".",

    "text": "Do you not see that it is not permissible for you to intend a specific single person from the tribe by your saying 'rajul' (a man), because one cannot be less than one in number. The intention of the speaker with this is not this purpose, nor is it to convey less contempt and humiliation. Rather, the intent is: The sayers of that are few, meaning: No one says that. If the matter is so, 'rajul' conveys the genus, and nothing else is encompassing; rather it is on the way of substitution, as if he said: The sayers of that are few if they became man by man. The meaning of: \"Qalla rajulun yaqulu dhaka\" (Rarely does a man say that) is like the meaning of: \"Aqalla rajulin\" (The least of men/Rarely a man), and this is not the place for its explanation. The distinction between the two words or the equality, except in what we mentioned of the state of your saying: That 'rajul' occurs in both of them in the same way. It has become clear by what we mentioned of the state of your saying: \"Dirhaman min 'ishrina dirhaman\" (A dirham out of twenty dirhams) that every specificator (*Mumayyiz*) in weight, area, and volume, its state is the state of this specificator in the counted, so know it. Not everything that conveys Multiplicity conveys Encompassing, and the clarification of every position that our speech covered has passed, so know it.\nWhat is intended as the genus has come added (Mudaf) in their speech. From that is what came in the Hadith: \"And Iraq was prevented its Dirhams and Qafiz,\" meaning its output and crops. Allah Mighty and Majestic said: (And if you count the favor (*ni'mah*) of Allah, you cannot calculate it). It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may Allah have mercy on him, that he read: (And His angels (*Mala'ikatihu*)), for he said: His writing (*Kitabuhu*) is more than His scribes (*Kutubihi*).\nAs for what conveys Multiplicity, while its wording is singular, which are nouns formulated for the plural, I divided it into two parts when detailing the summary that started this speech. Know that these nouns, despite their difference, are not devoid of three states: Either the noun is coined for the few specifically, and the few is intended as the lowest number, which is from three to ten, like *Al-Nafar*, *Al-Raht*, and *Al-Dhawd*. Or a specific number is intended by it, like their saying: *Sirmah*, *Hajmah*, *Hunaydah*, and *Arj*. Or Multiplication is intended by it, that is: like *Qawm* (people), *Nisa'* (women), *Kalib* (dogs), and what runs their course. Each of these types, its ruling is to convey what it was coined for. So we say: If the speaker says: \"I passed by a *Nafar*,\" or \"I saw a *Raht*,\" or \"I crossed over a *Dhawd*,\" then every number from three to ten is related by the relation of its companion in that the noun was coined for it, and that it conveys it if it conveys it in reality. Whenever what specifies it to some of what it was coined for is conjoined with it, it is conveying that in reality. If it is released absolutely, the first of these numbers is certain, and the rest reaches it by indication. We only said this because the word was coined for minimization. Since it was formulated for minimization and it has a known end in what it covers, just as it has a known beginning, judgment was made on the certain part of it which is the first, excluding the middle and the last, because all did not exit from what the word was coined for of minimization. The first was certain, and what is other than it is not certain, and taking the certain is more appropriate. The way of this is not the way of the noun coined for different things, so it is not diverted to one of them except by indication. Do you not see that it is not a condition of what several meanings share that it is not coined for one of them unless it has been coined for the rest, whether it happened for them by one coiner or two coiners. And indeed among the conditions of this is covering every one of the numbers it is suitable for after convention on one of them by it, due to their sharing in what it was coined for that one. This is the way of these and their likes.\nAs for if he says: \"I passed by a *Hunaydah*,\" and what runs its course, its benefit is what it was coined for of number, because *Hunaydah* is a name for a hundred and what approaches it, and *Al-Arj* is a name for five hundred and six hundred up to a thousand. Likewise what runs its course of what is restricted to a number, or a number and what approximates it, and this matter is clear.\nAs for *Al-Jamil*, *Al-Baqir*, *Al-Da'in*, and *Al-Kalib*, its benefit is Multiplicity, because these nouns were coined for Multiplication, so know it. Just as they have no amount they end at, they have no beginning either. But they cover what is many and are not specific to a number, even if many, except by indication.\nAs for what conveys Multiplicity and its wording is the wording of the Plural, it has rulings, and we will clarify the saying in it with what is present.\nKnow that Plural is of two types: Sound Plural (*Jam' Salamah*) and Broken Plural (*Jam' Taksir*). Sound Plural is wherein the wording of the singular remains sound. It has two structures: One is what is with Waw and Nun or Ya and Nun, and the second: is with Alif and Ta. Sibawayh said: And this, its wording is the plural with Alif and Ta and Waw and Nun for tripling the lowest number up to ten-ing it, which is the singular. Just as Alif and Nun became for its dualization, and its dual is less than its tripled. Do you not see that the genitive of Ta and its accusative are the same, and the genitive of the two and the three who are on dualization and their accusative are the same. So this brings closer that Alif and Ta and Waw and Nun are for the lowest because it agreed with the dual. End of the quote from him.",

    "text": "Know that what we narrated of his speech contains an inference to two things of his doctrine:\nFirst: That the first of plural is at three. Do you not see he said: Tripling is the lowest number, meaning tripling of numbers when he judged upon Waw and Nun, and Alif and Ta.\nSecond: That he stated clearly that Alif and Ta, and Waw and Nun are for the lowest of numbers, because it agreed with the dual. He means by agreement that the dual in the position of accusative and genitive [is with Ya], just as the sound plural is in the position of accusative and genitive with Ya. And just as the plural with Alif and Ta is in the position of accusative and genitive with Kasra, and Kasra is the sister of Ya. Since these structures agreed in what we mentioned, and the sound plural was on the limit of dualization in the soundness of the singular's wording in it, it became just as it ascended from singular to dualization in benefit, it ascended from dualization to three in benefit. Then its ruling became the ruling of three in that it is from the lowest number related to it by the relation of three, so it became suitable for all. So you say: His doctrine implies that the plural with Waw and Nun, and Alif and Ta is primarily in what the lowest number conveys, which is from three to ten, and is suitable for the many since this structure was not taken by the plural secondly. We do not mean by our saying: \"It is suitable for it\" that if used for the many it would be metaphorical in it, but we mean that primarily it is for the lowest number, then it is suitable for the many also by coinage. Whenever evidence indicates that it is for the many, it is diverted to it. We do not say: It is a metaphor in it. What made the ruling of priority for the lowest number is what Sibawayh mentioned of its being built upon dualization and coming on its limit, and its agreement with it in what he mentioned. What allowed it to be for the many, and indicated it, is that this structure, I mean the sound plural, was not taken by the plural a structure as the structures formulated for the lowest number were taken, which are four: *Af'al*, *Af'ilah*, *Af'ul*, and *Fi'lah*, and broken as singulars are broken due to their suitability to them in conveying the few. Do you not see their saying: *Akru'* and *Akari'*, and *Abyat* and *Abayit*, and that they do not do that with the sound plural. What establishes what we mentioned and supports it is that the sound plural, if diminished (*sughghira*), is diminished on its wording. So we say in *Muslimin*: *Musaylimun*, and in *Ja'farin*: *Ju'ayfirun*, and in *Muslimat*: *Musaylimat*. Just as what was coined for the lowest number is diminished on its wording, which are these four structures. They were only diminished on their wordings because when they conveyed the few, they resembled the singular in its conveying of the lowest number on their wordings. The structures conveying Multiplicity, if diminished, are returned to their lowest number if they have a lowest number. If they do not have a lowest number, they are returned to their singular, so it is diminished and the plural sign is attached to it. If the matter is so, it becomes clear that the ruling of *Muslimat* and *Muslimun* in that priority belongs to the lowest number, and the ruling of these four structures is the same. Even if these structures, if used for the many, would be by way of metaphor because just as they borrow words, they borrow structures also. The sound plural, even if priority belongs to the lowest number, is suitable for the many also, conveying it in reality if an indication is conjoined with it. This is the ruling of sound plural.\nIf it is said: If the sound plural, even if priority belongs to the lowest number, has been coined for the many also, and ends up with it if evidence indicates it, and that is making the priority overcome it, why was it treated in diminution on the way of what was coined for the lowest number, which is that it is diminished on its wording? It is said to him: The plural of multitude, whenever it does not have a lowest number, is returned to its singular. If returned to its singular, it is like the sound plural if diminished. Do you not see that *Masajid*, if you diminish it, you say in its diminution *Musayjidat*, so it is on the limit of *Musaylimat* if you diminish *Muslimat*. If it is so, then it is as if in diminishing it on its wording they combined the two rulings for it: the ruling of the lowest number which is diminished on its wording, and the ruling of the plural of multitude if it does not have a lowest number so it is returned to its singular, since it was coined for both, I mean for the few and the many. Even if when isolated, priority belongs to the few due to the evidence that indicated. It has been narrated that Hassan ibn Thabit, when he recited to Al-Nabigha his poem in which is:\n*We have the white bowls (*Al-Jafnat*) shining in the forenoon ... and our swords drip blood from bravery.*\nHe criticized his saying *Al-Jafnat*, and said to him: Why did you reduce your bowls? This supports what we mentioned, so understand.\nAs for the second part, which is the Broken Plural, it has two structures: One for the few, and its mention has preceded. And the second for the many. It happens in most cases that a thing obtains both structures. It also happens that it is restricted to one of them, then used, if it is for the few, in the many also, and if it is for the many, in the few also.",

    "text": "Since number is of two types: few number and many number, the noun of number from three to ten was specified to be built on the structure of the few and added to it, excluding the structure of the many, so that they do not exit from similarity to contrast. So it was said: *Burd* and *Burdan*, and *Thalathatu Abrad* (Three garments); *Fals* and *Falsan*, and *Thalathatu Aflus* (Three fils); *Jabal* and *Jabalan*, and *Thalathatu Ajbal* (Three mountains); *Ghulam* and *Ghulaman*, and *Thalathatu Ghilmah* (Three boys); *Ghurab* and *Ghuraban*, and *Thalathatu Aghribah* (Three crows). The use of the structure of the many is not preferred in what has a structure of the few if they want to clarify the few number, except rarely. The structures of the many are more than counting can cover except after effort, then it is not secure that much of it will also fall out, so I did not seek to restrict them.\nKnow that the structures which convey Multiplicity, like *Al-Fujjar*, *Al-Fussaq*, *Al-Zunah*, *Al-Ghuzah*, *Al-Buyut*, *Al-Masajid*, *Al-Ghuraf*, *Al-Shuraf*, *Al-Ghilman*, *Al-Sudan*, *Al-Bidan*, and what ran their course, whenever nothing conjoins with them specifying them with a specific number, their ruling is the ruling of generic nouns. Except that generic nouns ascend from the One, and these structures ascend from the Three. Their agreement is that each of them was coined to cover that which it conveys whatever amount it reaches. Whenever nothing conjoins with it specifying it, it must be conveying Multiplicity. Everything inferred in generic nouns can be inferred in these structures that they were coined for Multiplicity and Inclusion.\nWe also say: The sound plural, whenever something conjoins with it taking it out of what is more primary to it of conveying the few, is attached to this also, because even if priority belongs to it conveying the few, it covers the many also by coinage, and the indication for this has passed. If it is so, His Almighty's saying: (And they, in the chambers (*Al-Ghurufat*), are safe) [Quran 34:37], with what conjoined to it of what we alerted to that He intends the lowest number [or rather, multitude?], attached in its conveying Multiplicity to the generic noun, and to what was coined for the many and specified by it. Likewise His Almighty's saying: (Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women) and all that runs its course.\nIf it is said: Why did you claim that the few number must be clarified by the structure of the few plural and added to it? Why wasn't it added to the structure of the many just as the part is added to the whole? I say: It was only added to the structure of the few due to the fewness of the counted number. If it were added to the structure of the many, it would not be good due to the fall of agreement and similarity between them, and the entry of distance and contrast in their definition. Do you not see that if you said: \"Khamsatu Jimal\" (Five camels [many plural]) or \"Sab'atu Bighal\" (Seven mules [many plural]), you would be minimizing by your saying: \"Khamsatu\" and \"Sab'atu\", and maximizing by your saying: \"Jimal\" and \"Bighal\", and between them is a contradiction that is not hidden. If you said: \"Khamsatu Ajmal\" and \"Sab'atu Abghul\", the number and its clarifier would be similar, and cooperate in conveying that it is of paucity, and each of the annexed and annexed-to would indicate the state of its companion.\nIf it is said: Allah Almighty has said: (And the divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three *Quru'*) [Quran 2:228], so He turned away from *Aqra'* which is for the lowest number to *Quru'* which is the many, and you claimed that does not occur nor is it good. The answer: *Aqra'* was not seen by Sibawayh, and its singular is *Qar'* with open Qaf. The analogy of *Fa'l* is to be on *Af'ul*, even if we affirmed it because of what appeared in the report of his saying: \"Ayyam Aqra'\", but it is among what deviated from analogy, even if it appeared in usage like *Istahwadha*. Just as analogy on *Istahwadha* is not permissible, likewise analogy on *Thalathatu Quru'* is not permissible. Our companions returned this interpretation to what it is upon, and looked and said: Its estimation is three *Aqra'* from the *Quru'*. Another way: It is that since the structure of the many is more frequent in usage and more famous than the structure of the few, evidenced by the fact that the like of Sibawayh did not make in the plural of *Qar'* other than *Quru'*, it became in the status of what no structure other than the many came in. So just as it is said: \"Thalathatu Rijal\" and \"Arba'atu Masajid\", it is said: \"Thalathatu Quru'\" since *Aqra'* is in the status of what did not come due to its scarcity.\nWhat reveals the ugliness of adding the few to the many and its exit from suitability to contradiction is that they did not diminish the structures of Multiplicity on their wordings since diminution is minimization. These structures are for Multiplication. So just as they rejected that due to the cessation of similarity from them and the occurrence of contrast in them, likewise we must reject what we denied, and this is clear. Whoever contemplates these places, their purposes in these structures become clear to him, and the correctness of what we clarified in all of them, Allah willing.",

    "text": "Know that what conveys Inclusion in Negation specifically and is not used in Affirmation is only in several chapters of it. It seems they were specified by it due to the frequency of affliction with them as they used to waste what they wasted according to the need for it. It was not used in Affirmation because what conveys Inclusion like it on its limit is not valid in Affirmation, since narration (*Hikayah*) here did not occur with it, and we have clarified that.\nAmong them is what is spoken in negating people, like: \"Ma biha du'wiyy\" (There is no one in it), and \"Ma biha tamur\", and \"Ma biha shafr\". Among them is what is in negating wealth, like: \"Ma lahu samm wa la hamm\", and \"Ma lahu qudha'milah\". Among them is what food is negated by, like: \"Ma dhaqtu 'alusan\". Among them is what sleep is negated by, like: \"Ma dhaqtu ghimadan wa la huthathan\". Among them is what pains are negated by, like: \"Ma bihi wadhiyah\". Among them is what jewelry is negated by, like: \"Ma 'alayha khadad\". These, despite their difference, and their likes, nothing of them is used in Affirmation. They convey the negation of the little of what they were coined for and the much of it.

    "text": "*And the tribe turbans us with its affair [makes us leaders] ... and our sayer hits the middle of the joint.*\n*So our riding camels visit the doors of kings ... and when we are made judges in the tribe we are just.*\n\nAl-Harithi said:\n*Visit Zaynab, a coming early has passed from you ... and tomorrow a journey will be serious with whom you love.*\n*How is the meeting when the one we love meeting ... is going to Najd early and you are going to the lowlands (Ghawr)?*\n*How many a burning [tear] settled on me and a sigh ... when it was said: The one you love will travel tomorrow.*\n*Watering [of rain] for the one I bid farewell, for he is ... from what he hides of separation, collapsing.*\n*Indeed I, on the morning of their separation, since I did not die ... of grief on the morning of their separation, am patient.*\n*O Marabid, the day of your separation has been decreed ... so is the meeting for a lover destined?*\n*She said, and her tear rose from her eye ... and a passion which bowels and conscience boil with.*\n*Indeed He who decreed separation upon the one ... whom souls love, is Capable of the meeting.*\n*The lovers may become distant, then repeat them ... times, and matters succeed matters.*\n*So I was silent out of sorrow and said: Perhaps ... and I knew that her speech was consoling.*\n*What would it harm your family if a lover is given ... or his ear is facilitated so he visits?*\n*They envy the little upon him from you, and with Him ... if he obtained the little from you, it is much.*\n*Nothing is easier than the visit of a night-comer ... who loves meeting you, and the meeting is easy.*\n*My soul is attached to your memory, and the bowels ... are anxious for you, when you are mentioned, they fly.*\n*Do not deny my anxiety for you and my childish passion ... Indeed the lover is excused in what he did.*\n*If you wished, the lover would be revived by a visit ... an eye would live for him, happy with it.*\n*And I have extended my hand for the giving of your gift ... Indeed the lover is poor towards the beloved.*\n*And I remembered you while Hellfire is defined ... with passion for your face, and the lover remembers well.*\n*Were it not for shame and that it be said: He complained of passion ... to one who grants protection by your passion.*\n*But I covered you lest our mention be raised ... and I covered myself, and the noble is covering.*\n*The blamers said: You have become too old for childish passion ... The blamers spoke truth, indeed I am old.*\n*If gray hair touches [me], my side locks have branched ... then love is the prime of youth, fresh.*\n*I wear it out and aging follows it with newness ... Indeed passion is long-lived, abundant.*\n\nMalik ibn al-Rayb said mentioning his alienation and illness and eulogizing himself:\n*O would that I knew, will I spend a night ... beside the Ghadha trees, driving the swift young camels?*\n*So would that the Ghadha, the riders did not cross its width ... and would that the Ghadha walked with the riders for nights.*\n*I say to Zayd while he has passion like me ... I see the opinion from us is that we visit Al-Ma'awiya.*\n*And how is a visit to the Ma'awi after ... we found a doctor other than that treating?*\n*So he spent the night distracting me with who dwells in the Ghadha ... even if it was nothing, O Zayd, but wishes.*\n*I see myself from the love of the Ghadha joining it ... so my family holds it and its shepherd my wealth.*\n*Indeed there was among the people of the Ghadha, if the Ghadha was near ... a visiting place, but the Ghadha is not near.*\n*My two friends from the high Rabi'ah of Mazin ... at Samnan, will what sufficed me suffice you two?*\n*I thought the Ghadha heals the passion, but I did not find ... the scent of the Ghadha healing the passion, my passion.*\n*And I had thought the Jinn had died and ended ... so I spent nights away from the humming of women.*\n*So when we descended the land of Amr from the Ghadha ... the soft grounds of the hills and the rights, the hidden places.*\n*Then in the Ghadha, O watering of who dwells in the Ghadha ... is the likeness of Sawda' whom I am not forgetting.*\n*Did you not see me, I sold error for guidance ... and became in the army of Ibn Affan, a raider.*\n*And I became in the land of the non-Arabs after ... I saw myself far from the land of the non-Arabs.*\n*Passion called me from the people of Awd, and my company ... was at Dhu al-Tabasayn, so I turned behind me.*\n*I answered passion when it called me with a tear ... I veiled myself with my cloak from it lest I be blamed.*\n*I say while the villages of the Kurds came between us ... May Allah reward Amr the best of what he was rewarding.*\n*If Allah returns me from the raid, I do not see ... even if my wealth is little, seeking what is behind me.*\n*By my life, if Khurasan assassinated my head ... Indeed I was far from the two gates of Khurasan.*\n*So to Allah is my deed the day I leave obediently ... my sons at the top of Al-Raqmatayn and my wealth.*\n*And the deed of the gazelles passing from right to left in the evening ... informing that I am perishing before me.*",

Suffice the turns of Time as a judge for the man.*\n*So I said when the reproach became long on them ... and they threatened to spend the night and cut off.*\n*For you two do not catch up with what passed ... and I am not regretful over what I missed.*\n*So your soul, honor it, for if you humiliate it ... upon yourself, you will never find an honorer for it.*\n*Humiliate the old wealth in what you love, for it ... if I die, the wealth will be plunder divided.*\n*And do not be miserable in it so an heir becomes happy ... with it when you are stuffed in the dusty hollow, darkened.*\n*He divides it as spoil and buys honor ... while you have become in a line of the earth greater.*\n*Be forbearing from the two ears and keep their affection ... for you are not hitting forbearance until you act forbearing.*\n*When you meet the grudges of the clan with deliberation ... and restraining harm, it cuts the disease for you, a cutting.*\n*And obstinacy did not send me in my passion ... if I did not find in what is before me an advance.*\n*If I wished, I would have rivaled the man of evil as he did not rival ... you, and you would have slapped the mean one, slapped.*\n*He saw the night, stars destroyed it leading it ... and the night traveler might hate the stingy blamed one.*\n*And I was a man of a group, a habit for them ... a wish that the guest spends the night quenched, fed.*\n*And their seeker praises and their friend is pleased ... if the rain missed the yard so it became dark.*\n*And an ugly word I turned away from so it did not harm ... and a crooked one I straightened so he became straight.*\n*And I forgive the ugly word of the generous one, saving him ... and I turn away from insulting the mean one, honoring myself.*\n*And I do not forsake the client even if he is forsaking ... nor do I insult the cousin if he is silenced.*\n*Nor did my wealth increase me in distance from him ... even if he was possessing a decrease of money, cut off.*\n*And a pitch-black night I wore its terror ... when the night frowned with the weak weakling.*\n*And the vagabond will not earn praise nor wealth ... if he does not ride a great thing of the matter.*\n*And did not witness the raiding horses in the forenoon ... raising dust with the hooves, dark.*\n*May Allah curse a vagabond whose wish and concern ... of life is to find clothing and food.*\n*He sees hunger as torture, and if he finds a fullness ... his heart spends the night from lack of concern, vague.*\n*Staying with the wealthy, not leaving ... if he attained a gift of food and a perch.*\n*He sleeps the forenoon until when his sleep is complete ... he wakes up cold of heart, swollen.*\n*But a vagabond whom ambitions assault ... and he proceeds against the days and Time, advancing.*\n*A youth of requests, who does not see hunger as sadness ... nor a meal, if he attained it, he counted as spoil.*\n*If he saw one day noble deeds turning away ... he aimed at the biggest of them then determined.*\n*You see his spear and his arrows and his shield ... and a ridged [sword], sharp of the blade, cutting.*\n*And the curves of a saddle, sparing, and his bridle ... the equipment of a brother of war, and a steed marked.*",

Then Umar ibn Abdullah ibn Abi Rabi'ah ibn al-Mughira ibn Abdullah ibn Umar ibn Makhzum appeared, and he was a youth that day. He greeted Abdullah and sat down. Abdullah said: \"Recite to us something.\" So he recited to him: \"Amin Ali Nu'min Anta Ghadin fa-Mubkiru\", until he reached its end, and it is about eighty verses. Ibn al-Azraq said: \"To Allah are you, O Ibn Abbas! We beat the livers of camels to you asking you about religion, and you turn away, and a youth from Quraysh comes to you and recites foolishness to you and you listen to him?\" [Ibn Abbas said:] \"By Allah, I did not hear foolishness.\" He said: \"Did he not recite to you:\n*She saw a man, as for when the sun opposes ... he is exposed to sun, and as for in the evening he feels cold.*\nIbn Abbas said: \"He did not recite it to us like this. Rather he said: 'Fayadh-ha' (he is exposed to the forenoon sun), and as for in the evening 'Fayakhsuru' (he feels cold).\" Ibn al-Azraq said: \"Have you memorized what he said?\" He said: \"By Allah, I did not hear it except my hour, and if I wished to narrate it I would repeat it.\" He said: \"Then repeat it.\" So he recited it to him. Ibn al-Azraq said: \"I have never seen anyone more retaining (*Arwa*) than you.\" Abdullah said: \"I have not seen anyone more retaining than Umar [ibn al-Khattab], nor more knowledgeable than Ali, may Allah be pleased with them both.\"\nThe poem:\n*Is it from the family of Nu'm you are going early then early morning ... the morning of tomorrow, or going in the evening then midday?*\n*For a need of the soul you did not say in its answer ... so you convey an excuse, and the speech excuses.*\n*You wander in love for Nu'm, so neither is the gathering united ... nor the rope connected nor the heart refraining.*\n*Neither is the proximity of Nu'm, if she nears you, beneficial ... nor does her distance console, nor are you patient.*\n*And another came before Nu'm, and the like of her ... forbade the possessor of intellect if you desist or think.*\n*If I visit Nu'm, a relative of hers ... does not cease, whenever I meet him, to frown.*\n*Hard upon him that I visit her house ... he conceals hatred for me, showing the hate.*\n*Convey from me to her peace, for it ... is denied, my visiting her, and publicized.*\n*By the sign of what she said the morning I met her ... at the flow of riders: Is this the publicized one?*\n*Stop and look, O Asma, do you know him ...

    "text": "Ibn Abbas said: 'He did not recite it to us like this. He only said: \"He becomes exposed to the sun (yad-ha).\" As for \"In the evening he becomes cold (yakhsar)\".' Ibn al-Azraq said: 'Did you memorize what he said?' He replied: 'By Allah, I only heard it this hour of mine, but if I wished to recite it back, I would return it.' He said: 'Then return it.' So he recited it to him. Ibn al-Azraq said: 'I have never seen anyone more retaining (of poetry) than you.' Abdullah [Ibn Abbas] said: 'I have never seen anyone more retaining than Umar, nor more knowledgeable than Ali, may Allah be pleased with them both.' The Poem: 'Is it from the family of Nu'm that you are leaving early... tomorrow morning, or departing in the evening then traveling by midday heat? For a need of the soul you did not speak in its answer... so you could present an excuse, and speech excuses. You wander in love towards Nu'm, but neither is the gathering united... nor is the rope connected, nor does the heart refrain. Neither is the nearness of Nu'm, if she draws near to you, beneficial... nor does her distance console, nor do you have patience. And another woman came instead of Nu'm, and the likes of her... forbid the possessor of reason, if he would desist or think. When I visited Nu'm, a relative of hers never ceased... becoming like a tiger (angry) whenever I met him. It is hard on him that I visit her house... he hides hatred for me, manifesting malice. Deliver my greetings to her, for indeed... my visiting her is denied and publicized. By the token of what she said the morning I met her... at the stream-bed of riders: \"Is this the publicized one? Stop and look, O Ism (name), do you recognize him... Is this the Mughiri who used to be mentioned? Is this the one whose description you praised? For I will not... by your life, forget him until the day I am buried.\" Nu'm said: \"No doubt, his color has been changed by... the night travel that revives his gait, and the midday journey. If it is indeed him, he has changed after us... from the covenant, and the human may change. My body has changed, but my character is as... you knew, and no informant has reported your secret.\" She saw a man who, if the sun opposes him... becomes exposed to it, and in the evening becomes cold. A brother of travel, a traverser of land, tossed about... by deserts, so he is disheveled and dusty. His shade upon the back of the mount is little... and soaked is what the patterned cloak repelled from him. She was pleased in her life by the shade of a room... and a lush, green, wrapped garden. And a guardian who sufficed her every thing that concerned her... so she does not stay awake for anything at the end of the night. And on the night of Dhu Dawran, she burdened me with night travel... and indeed the deceived lover may be burdened with terror. I spent the night as a watchman for the companions on a brink... watching those of them who patrolled, and looking. Towards them, when would sleep take them... while I had a sitting place that, were it not for the need, was rugged. My young she-camel spent the night in the open, and her saddle... was for a night visitor or one who came exposed. I spent the night whispering to the soul: Where is her tent... and where is the source for the matter I am coming to? A fragrant scent directed the heart to her; I recognized it... belonging to her, and the passion of the soul which used to appear. When I lost the sound from them and were extinguished... lamps that were lit at evening and illuminated. And a small moon I was hoping for its setting disappeared... and shepherds went home and night-talkers slept. And the voice lowered for me; I approached with the walk of the... sand-grouse (or snake), while my corner shied away in fear of the people. I greeted when I surprised her, so she was distracted with love... and she almost spoke aloud in returning the greeting. She said, biting her fingertips: \"You have exposed me... while you are a man whose easy affair is difficult. I show you, since we are easy for you, did you not fear... a watcher, while around me are those of your enemies present? By Allah, I do not know if it is a haste of a need... that traveled with you, or has the one you were fearing slept?\" I said to her: \"Nay, love and passion led me... to you, and not a soul among the people perceives.\" She said, having softened and her fear subsided: \"May the protection of your Great Lord protect you. You are, O Abu al-Khattab, undisputed... trustworthy over me, given command as long as you stay.\" Oh, what a night it was! Its length became short... whereas my night before that was not short. Oh, what a diversion was there, and a session... for us, which no disturber disturbed for us. It flutters when she smiles revealing it, as if it is... hailstones or a chamomile in bloom. She gazes at me with her eyes as... a young gazelle gazes at a doe in the middle of a thicket. When the night passed except a little of it... and the sequence of its stars almost sank. She signaled that the tribe, the time has come for their... waking, but a promise from you is difficult (to keep/obtain).'",

Do you not feel shame or desist or think?*\n*If you come, grant the glance of your eye to other than us ... so they think that passion is where you look.*\n*So the last covenant I had with her was where she turned away ... and a cheek, pure, and an eye-socket appeared to her.*\n*Except that I said: O Nu'm, a saying ... to her while the Arhabi riding camels were being urged.*\n*Congratulations to the husband of the Amiri woman her scent, the ... delicious, and her fragrance which I remember.*\n*So I stood to a lean camel, her fat betrayed by ... the night travel until her meat is stripped.*\n*And my confinement for needs until as if she is ... the worn-out wood of a board or a tied litter.*\n*And water in a desert, its familiarity is little ... empty lands, summer did not create a settlement for it.*\n*In it is a built place for the spider as if it is ... on the end of the sides, raw cloth spread out.*\n*I arrived and I do not know: Is what is after my arrival ... of the night [more], or is what passed of it more?*\n*So a ghoul of the land circled it as if she is ... if she turned, a mad woman when she looks.*\n*Disputing with me out of greed for the water, her head ... and before what she desires is a filled well.*\n*Trying for the arrival, were it not for her rein ... and my pulling with it, she would have almost broken many times.*\n*So when I saw the harm from her and that I ... was in a town of land in which there is no squeezing [for water].*\n*I cut for her from the side of the basin a drinking place ... small like the measure of the span or it is smaller.*\n*When she started drinking in it, there was not for the meeting of ... her lips from it the measure of the span, a span.*\n*And no bucket except the heel was its rope ... to the water, a strap and the braided rein.*\n*So she sniffed and did not dislike, and nothing repelled her drinking ... from quenching, a turbid beaten water.*\n\nPoem of Kuthayyir Azzah\nThe narrators said that Kuthayyir ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Khuza'i entered upon Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, and Al-Akhtal was with him.

    "text": "They said: Kuthayyir was asked one day: Are you more poetic or Jamil? He said: Rather, I am. It was said: Do you say this while you are his narrator? He said: Yes, because he says:\n*May Allah throw mote into the two eyes of Buthaynah ... and into the white of her teeth, breakers.*\nAnd I say:\n*Wholesome, palatable, without a lingering disease ... for Azzah is what she permitted of our honors.*\n\nAnd this is the poem of the verse:\n*My two friends, this is the trace of Azzah, so hobble ... your two young camels, then weep where she settled.*\n*And touch dust that had touched her skin ... and a shade and a house where she spent the night and stayed.*\n*And do not despair that Allah forgives you two ... sins if you pray where she prayed.*\n*For she swore an oath by what Quraysh sacrificed to ... on the morning of the two narrow passes and said Talbiyah.*\n*I call you, as long as the pilgrims perform Hajj and say Takbir ... at Fayfa Ghazal, a company, and raise voices.*\n*And she was, regarding cutting the rope between me and her ... like one vowing a vow, she fulfilled so she became lawful [to break it?].*\n*So I said to her: O Azz, every calamity ... if the soul is settled for it one day, becomes easy.*\n*And no human met from love a prime ... that is general, nor a blind one except it cleared.*\n*As if I am calling a rock when she turned away ... from the hard rocks, if the white-footed goats walk on it they slip.*\n*And my passion for you, O Azz, if you knew it ... is like the passion of a thirsty bird that went astray from water.*\n*Turning away, so she does not meet you except stingy ... so whoever became bored of that connection, she became bored.*\n*She permitted a sanctuary people did not graze before her ... and settled in valleys not settled before.*\n*Would that my young she-camel was at Azzah's, tied ... with a weak rope, she deceived it so she fled.*\n*And her saddle was left in the resident tribe ... and she had a seeker other than me, so she recovered.*\n*So who is for an eye that does not see the peaks of the sanctuary ... nor the mountain of Al-Awshal except it pours?*\n*Persistent when it flows, disobedient when it weeps ... equal whether it was little in weeping or much.*\n*And when we ascended in an ascent of passion ... to ranks from which I was hated and became weary.*\n*I was like the diseased woman whose disease returned ... at the time the two callers said: She recovered.*\n*And I was like the possessor of two legs: a sound leg ... and a leg Time shot in it so it became paralyzed.*\n*And I was like the one with a rib, when she bore ... on her rib after stumbling, she rose.*\n*I want the stay at her place and I think she ... if we prolong the stay at her place, becomes bored.*\n*I wished for her until when I saw her ... I saw deaths, filled, having overshadowed.*\n*And nothing deceived me except a book she wrote ... so would that my right hand before that had been paralyzed.*\n*The swine tasks her with insulting me, and she has no ... desire to humiliate me, but for the owner she submitted.*\n*Wholesome, palatable, without a lingering disease ... for Azzah is what she permitted of our honors.*\n*So by Allah, I did not approach except she distanced ... for cutting off, nor did I increase except she decreased.*\n*So if it is goodwill, then welcome and hello ... and goodwill was due for her with us, but it was little.*\n*And if it is the other, then behind us are ... lands, if I task the white camels with them, they tire.*\n*My two friends, indeed Al-Hajibiyyah has exhausted ... your two young camels, and my she-camel has become tired.*\n*So let not a connection to Azzah become distant, which has become ... in the end, its causes have turned away.*\n*Do evil to us or do good, neither blamed ... with us nor hated if she hated.*\n*But bestow and remember from an affection ... for us, a friendship that was with you so it remained.*\n*For I, even if she turned away, am praising and truthful ... regarding her in what she slipped to us.*\n*And I am not invoking destruction upon Azzah ... nor gloating if Azzah's sandal slipped.*\n*May destruction strike him who wishes destruction for you ... and may those who said 'Azzah went mad' go mad.*\n*Let not the slanderers think that my ardor ... for Azzah was a flood then it cleared.*\n*I have become recovered from a sickness with her ... just as a thirsty woman was sickened then recovered.*\n*So by Allah, then Allah, no one settled after her ... nor before her from a friendship where she settled.*\n*And no day passed over me like her day ... even if other days were great and majestic.*\n*So oh wonder for the heart, how is its acknowledgement ... and for the soul when it was settled, how it submitted.*\n*And for the eye are flocks whenever I remember her ... and for the heart is anxiety if the eye became bored.*",

I abandoned what was between us and she abandoned.*\n*Am like the one hoping for the shade of a cloud, whenever ... he settled in it for a nap, it vanished.*\n*As if I and she are a cloud of a drought-stricken one ... he hoped for it, but when it passed him, it poured.*\n\nPoem of Jamil Buthaynah\nThey mentioned that Kuthayyir ibn Abd al-Rahman said: Jamil ibn Abdullah ibn Ma'mar, who is Abu Umayr, said to me: Go to Buthaynah and take a promise from her for me. I said: When was your last meeting with her, and is there a sign between you and her? He said: My last meeting with them was while they were at Wadi al-Dawm washing their clothes. He said: So I came to them and found her father sitting in the courtyard. I greeted and he replied. I conversed with him for an hour until he asked me to recite poetry. So I recited to him and said:\n*So I said to her: O Azz, my companion sent ... despite the distance of the abode, and the entrusted one conveys.*\n*That you make an appointment between me and you ... and that you command me with what I do in it.*\n*And the last covenant from you was the day you met me ... at the bottom of Wadi al-Dawm while the garment was being washed.*\nHe said: When Buthaynah heard, and she was behind her father in that curtain of hers, she struck the side of the tent with her palm and said: \"Scram!\" Her father said to her: \"What is it, O Buthaynah, what is wrong with you?\" She said: \"A dog comes to us when people sleep from behind this hill.\" Kuthayyir said: So I returned to Jamil and informed him that she promised him behind the hill when people sleep.\nJamil only needed someone to convey for him because of what Abu Ubaydah narrated. He said: Buthaynah's people complained about Jamil to Mu'awiyah, so he made their blood lawful (permitted killing him) and said: If you catch him near it, I have wasted his blood for you (made it unretaliated). So Jamil was warned and stuck to greeting [from afar], and began sending the sign with the slave girl and the shepherd and the rider he trusts. Therefore he says:\n*Buthaynah said: You do not care about our separation ... Yes, by your grandfather, indeed I do care.*\n*Do you not see me, because of the crime of her love ... walking in smooth armor, tucking up my shirt.*\n\nAnd the Poem:\n*What stirred your longing from the decay of ruins ... at Al-Barq, a passing of east wind and a passing of north wind.*\n*The north wind played with its novelty and struck it ... the star of Arcturus with a pouring, heavy rain.*\n*The violent winds dragged their tails in it ... the dragging of women the excesses of trails.*\n*So they revealed dark [stones], their era is old ... and they remained for epochs of years.*\n*And I remembered a quarter our families settled in ... when we were in circles there, settling.*\n*We stop the talk if we fear a hater ... and we hide when we fear with proverbs.*\n*Until our family separated on an intention ... of casting [far], and our family announced departure.*\n*They departed, so soft ones like dolls departed ... white of faces, swaying in the thickets.*\n*The service of slave-girls around them, and they handed ... with their palms the reins of the camels.*\n*They went with the piebald [camels], others complain ... the violence of the driving, lifting the tails.*\n*They put Aqarih all on their right ... and the hills of Burqat As'as on the left.*\n*And I looked so my tear overflowed after ... the litters passed and were veiled by a mirage.*\n*The width of Al-Jabajib from Uthal as went ... the heavy ships, pushing with weights.*\n*Is it every possessor of grief you knew his place ... you forget his affection, and I am not forgetting?*\n*Without proximity, there is not in distance ... except the brief visit, and not much connection.*\n*Buthaynah said: You do not care about our separation ... Buthaynah was ignorant, indeed I do care.*\n*And the criminals, out of fear and devotion ... drive every noble, swift she-camel.*\n*Forcibly, as if their eyes from the night travel ... and from fatigue are the flows of water-trickles.*\n*Indeed I conceal her love while some of them ... regarding whom he loves is like the seeker of lost camels.*\n*O Buthayn, do you know how much you tasked me ... of hamstringing a swift she-camel and the war of clients.*\n*And traversing the desert, its Jinn play music ... after the calm, with a sturdy, fast she-camel.*\n*And I have indicated to your cousin a pregnant [war] ... from our war, mangy, possessing shackles/thirst.*\n*A war whose practice distresses the weak ... conceived upon barrenness and length of non-conception.*\n*Do you not see me, because of the crime of her love ... walking in smooth armor, tucking up my shirt?*\n*The rust of iron is on my shoulders as if I am ... a black [camel] covered in pitch/tar.*\n*O would that the pleasure of our life returned to us ... in the like of an era that has passed, empty.*\n*So we sell days that passed in the past ... short, for days that followed, long.*\n*And when the enemy, his news are belied ... and when the advisor is believed in sayings.*\n*From every sociable woman, as if her fangs ... are hail of a falling place of a meadow, often settled.*\n*Pouring like the morning cloud of Al-Salm, its ascent runs ... over the Rajajah from thick, heavy [clouds].*\n*Whoever you give it to, I am closer to what he missed ... of her, even if she did not reward him with a gift.*\n*And fleshy ankles appeared and a lean flank ... the sash roamed upon it every roaming.*\n*And a buttock, full, and a leg, plump ... white, silencing the speech of the anklet.*\n*Until when the darkness mixed and tempted me ... consolation won, and they are not reducing/sparing.*",

    "text": "News of Majnun Layla\nThey mentioned that Kuthayyir entered upon Abd al-Malik, who said to him: Recite to me something you said about Azzah. He said: Rather I recite to you what I praised you with. He said: I ask you by the right of Abu Turab [Ali], that you recite to me your poetry about Azzah. He said: You asked me by a right upon me that is great. So he began reciting to him while his eyes were shedding tears. Abd al-Malik said: How strong is your love for Azzah! Have you ever seen anyone whose love was stronger than yours? He said: I inform you, O Commander of the Faithful: I went out, and longing stirred in me, and remembrance of Azzah. They had sought pasture near the tribe for a time. I passed by a man who had set a trap for himself, isolated from the tribe. I turned to him and said: Is there any hospitality? He said: I am isolated from the tribe, and I have set my ropes, so be patient a little, I will drive the gazelles towards you. If something falls into the ropes, we eat together, for I have not tasted anything for three [days]. So he went to drive. A dark, long-necked doe fell into his trap. He hastened towards her, and I was where I could see and hear. He began wiping the dust from her, then released her and reset the rope and came to me. I said: O you, have you seen anyone do your deed? We both complain of hunger, until when Allah brought relief, you made us destitute of our provision? He said: Woe to you, I looked at her and at her eyes, so I likened her to the one I love. Have you seen one who eats the likeness of his love? He recited saying:\n*O likeness of Layla, do not fear, for I ... am today, among the wild beasts, a friend to you.*\n*I say, having released her from her bond ... You are free for the sake of Layla, if she gave thanks.*\nThen he said: Stay, for if something falls we eat. So I stayed hoping that hunger would prevent him from returning to the like of his deed. A gazelle fell into his trap. He strove towards it, released it, and it ran. He recited saying:\n*O likeness of Layla, if you stayed an hour ... perhaps my heart would recover from its passion.*\n*And not that you resembled her then did not return ... safe; I am compassionate for her in life.*\nI said: Woe to you, hunger has exhausted us. And I left him, knowing that he is mad with love. Then I passed by gazelles grazing. I said: If I guide him to them, I hope he drives them, and his knowledge that it is my game prevents him from releasing what falls into his trap of them, so he eats and feeds me. I returned to him and said: Do you not see those gazelles still, grazing? He said: Far be it! I saw Layla grazing in this meadow and playing. And I said:\n*I saw gazelles grazing in the middle of a meadow ... and I used to see Layla, so I became soft for them forever.*\n*So O gazelle, eat luxuriously, happily, and do not fear ... for I am a neighbor to you even if you feared forever.*\nThen he went and left me. This, O Commander of the Faithful, is the most loving lover I saw. He said: Who do you think he is? He said: Al-Majnun Qays ibn al-Mulawwah, and he is from Banu Amir ibn Sa'sa'ah. Among what he intended of his poetry in the confusion of his mind is his poem:\n\nPoem of Majnun Layla\n*I remembered Layla and the past years ... and days we did not fear a transgressor against the amusement.*\n*So I said, and I did not control: O Ka'b ibn Amir ... because of a love at Dhat al-Raqmatayn, it appeared to me.*\n*When we traveled at night and you were before us ... your memory sufficed as a guide for our riding camels.*\n*A fire of longing was kindled in my heart, so there became ... for it a blazing flame in my heart.*\n*It is magic, except that for magic there is a ruqyah (cure) ... and I do not find a curer for what is in me.*\n*And you two told me that Tayma is a home ... for Layla when the summer casts the anchors.*\n*So these months of summer have passed ... so what is with distance throwing Layla to the throwing-places?*\n*The two sons of Kulayb blame you regarding her foolishly ... so would that passion, O sons of Kulayb, was in my place.*\n*And if a slanderer, his house in Yamama ... and my house in the highest of Hadramawt, he would be guided to me.*\n*And what is for them, may Allah not beautify their preservation ... of luck, in cutting off Layla my ropes.*\n*If I were blind striking the earth with a stick ... deaf, and she called me, I would answer the caller.*\n*And I go out from between the sitters, perhaps I ... talk to the soul about you, O Layla, alone.*\n*And you are the one who, if you wished, made my life miserable ... and if you wished, after Allah, blessed my mind.*\n*And indeed I seek to faint while I have no slumber ... perhaps a phantom of you meets my phantom.*\n*If my eye applies kohl with your eye, I do not cease ... in good, and a flood clears from my heart.*\n*If I traveled in the open land, you see me ... cajoling my saddle to lean towards my side.*\n*May Allah water neighbors of Layla, the distance cast ... them until they occupied the Matali (places).*\n*I exchanged for your gift, O Umm Malik ... whispers of worry attending my pillow.*\n*For indeed that which I hoped for, O Umm Malik ... turned my back-head gray and infatuated my heart.*\n*So two days: a day in the company, muddied ... and a day I race the running winds.*\n*I count the nights, night after night ... and I was for a time not counting the nights.*\n*If Time folds you, O Umm Malik ... then the affair of the decreeing deaths is my affair.*\n*My two friends, if the turns of nights circle upon ... Umm Malik, then seek an announcer of death for me.*\n*And do not leave me, neither for a hastened death ... nor for survival, you two looking at my remaining.*\n*My two friends, no by Allah, I do not control weeping ... if a flag from the family of Layla appeared to me.*\n*My two friends, no by Allah, I do not control what ... Allah decreed regarding Layla nor what He decreed for me.*\n*He decreed her for another and tested me with her love ... so why not with something other than Layla did He test me?*\n*My two friends, if they depart with Layla, prepare ... for me the bier and shrouds and ask forgiveness for me.*\n*I testify before Allah that I love her ... so this is for her from me, so what is from her for me?*\n*Is Layla beaten for my visiting her ... and taken as a sin for her that she sees me?*\n*Right if she was right, and if she was ... left, passion disputes me regarding my left.*\n*I see myself when I pray, I turned ... my face towards her, even if the prayer place was behind me.*\n*And I have no polytheism, but her love ... is the place of the grief, it baffled the treating doctor.*\n*I love of names what agreed with her name ... and resembled it or was close to it.*\n*And no namesake of hers from the people ... was mentioned to me except my tear wet my cloak.*\n\nNews of Layla al-Akhyaliyyah and Tawbah ibn al-Humayyir\nThey mentioned that Tawbah al-Humayyir al-Amiri is one of the famous lovers of the Arabs. He was brave, a raider. His companion was Layla al-Akhyaliyyah the poetess. About Tawbah she says:\n*I swore I will weep after Tawbah, a dead one ... and care about whom the circles [of calamities] circled upon.*\n*By your life, there is no shame in death for the youth ... if shames do not hit him in life.*\nShe entered upon Abd al-Malik after she aged. He said to her: What did Tawbah see in you when he loved you? She said: What the people saw in you when they appointed you. Abd al-Malik laughed until a black tooth he used to hide appeared.\nThey mentioned that Tawbah traveled to Syria. He passed by Banu Udhrah, and Buthaynah saw him. She began looking at him. That was hard on Jamil. He said to him: Who are you? He said: I am Tawbah ibn al-Humayyir. He said: Do you want to wrestle? He said: That is up to you. Buthaynah threw a dyed sheet to him, so he wrapped himself in it. Then he wrestled him, and Jamil threw him down. Then he raced him, and Jamil outstripped him. He said: O you, you only do this by the wind (spirit/presence) of this one. But descend with us to the valley. They descended, so Tawbah threw him down and outstripped him.\nTawbah used to see Layla veiled. Then her brothers ordered her to inform them of his coming so they could kill him. So she unveiled to warn him. When he saw her unveiled, he knew that was due to an event, so he turned away. Regarding that he says:\n*I used to, whenever I came to Layla, she veiled ... so her unveiling to me in the morning made me suspicious.*\n\nAnd the Poem which belongs to Tawbah ibn al-Humayyir\n*Her house distanced you with Layla, you do not visit her ... and her destination became far and her rope twisted.*\n*And her destination lightened from the south of Unayzah ... just as its quiver lightened from the arrows of the archer.*",

Indeed, I seek to be covered [in sleep] though I have no drowsiness... perhaps a phantom from you might meet my phantom. If my eye is anointed with your eye [seeing you], I cease not... in goodness, and it clears a flood [of grief] from my heart. If I travel in the open land, I see myself... coaxing my saddle to lean towards my direction. May Allah water neighbors of Layla; the distance... has tossed them until they occupied the ruined dwellings. I have exchanged your gift, O Umm Malik... for whispers of worry that attend my pillow. For that which I hoped for, O Umm Malik... has turned my side-hair gray and captivated my heart. So two days: a day in the company of people, muddy... and a day I race the running winds.

And no namesake of hers was mentioned before me... from among the people, except that my tears wetted my cloak.' News of Layla al-Akhyaliyya and Tawba ibn al-Humayyir. They mentioned that Tawba al-Humayyir al-Amiri was one of the famous lovers of the Arabs. He was brave and a raider. His companion was Layla al-Akhyaliyya, the poetess. Regarding Tawba, she says: 'I swore I would weep for Tawba, dead... and I would care for the one whom misfortunes turned against. By your life, there is no shame in death for the youth... if shameful deeds did not afflict him during life.' She entered upon [Caliph] Abd al-Malik when she was old. He said to her: 'What did Tawba see in you when he loved you?' She said: 'What the people saw in you when they appointed you.' Abd al-Malik laughed until a black tooth he used to hide appeared. They mentioned that Tawba traveled to the Levant and passed by the Banu Udhra. Buthayna saw him and kept looking at him. This distressed Jamil. He said to him: 'Who are you?' He said: 'I am Tawba ibn al-Humayyir.' He said: 'Do you want to wrestle?' He said: 'That is up to you.' Buthayna threw him a dyed sheet, so he wrapped himself in it. Then he wrestled him, and Jamil threw him down. Then he raced him, and Jamil beat him. He said: 'O man, you only do this by the wind (spirit/presence) of this woman. But descend with us to the valley.' They descended, and Tawba threw him down and beat him. Tawba used to see Layla veiled. Then her brothers ordered her to inform them of his coming so they could kill him. She unveiled her face to warn him. When he saw her unveiled, he knew it was due to a new event, so he retreated. Regarding that he says: 'And I used to, whenever I came to Layla, she would veil herself... so her unveiling this morning made me suspicious.' The Poem belonging to Tawba ibn al-Humayyir: 'Her abode has distanced Layla from you; you do not visit her... and her destination has become remote and her rope twisted. Her destination has lightened from the south of Unayza... just as a quiver lightens of the arrows of the archers. Men said: \"Her distance does not harm you.\"... Nay, everything that thins the souls harms them. Does it not harm the eye that it repeats the weeping... and its sleep and joy are prevented from it? I see the day coming without Layla as if... a year and its months came without Layla. For every meeting we meet there is a smile... even if I visit her every day for a year. My two friends, go gently, rightly guided, for... Dariyya and its yoke have come between [me] and the beloved.'",

May the rainer of the white morning clouds water you.*\n*Clarify to us, may your feathers not cease to be soft ... and may you not cease in a green [tree], abundant its freshness.*\n*And Layla claimed that I am a libertine ... for myself is its piety or upon me is its debauchery.*\n*So say to Uqayl: What is the talk of a group ... enemies surrounded it, its helper is far.*\n*If they do not desist, the horses will be ridden between us ... and galloped with a leg or a wing that flies them.*\n*Perhaps you, O goat leaping in a rope ... are Layla's punisher that she sees me visiting her.*\n*And a dark [she-camel] from the secrets of the Mahri camels as if she is ... a doe of a herd, other than what her saddle touched.*\n*Of the Na'bat (fast ones), walking a Na'b pace as if ... her rein is tied to a trunk of Arak.*\n*Of the 'Arkarkiyyat (strong ones), a lean camel as if she is ... a rope of fiber, its twister tightened it strongly.*\n*I crossed with her the middle parts of every desert ... its destruction is feared when its dust flows.*\n*The weak of the people appear in it as if they are ... tadpoles of water whose pond dried up from them.*\n*And the lion of the night which is between its half ... and Isha, its captive is doubted.*\n*The multitude of enemies refused that they avoid ... my dogs until their biting ones are provoked.*\n*And he does not complain of my ignorance, but my equipment ... you see its sharpening slow against my enemies.*\n*Is the doubt of death snatching me while I have not visited ... virgins from Hamdan, white their throats.*\n*Rising with heavy buttocks and shanks ... plump, and small feet, their waists.*\n\nNews of Suhaym, Slave of Banu al-Has-has\nThey narrated that Abdullah ibn Abi Rabi'ah al-Makhzumi wrote to Uthman ibn Affan, may Allah be pleased with him: I have bought for you an Abyssinian slave, a poet, so look if you want him. He was presented to him. He said: He is the slave of Banu al-Has-has, who is Ibn Nufathah ibn Sa'd ibn Asad from Asad ibn Khuzaimah ibn Mudrikah. The slave's name is Suhaym. They said: Yes, he is a poet who is desired. He said: I have no need for him, because the poet has no sanctity. The share of the slave poet from him, if he is satiated, is to compose love poetry about their women, and if he is hungry, to satirize them. And he returned him.\nThey said: So a man bought him. When he departed with him, he recited saying:\n*Is it longing while no more than a night has passed ... so how if the riding camels travel with us a month?*\n*And I did not fear Malik would sell me ... for anything, even if his fingertips became empty.*\n*Your brother and the client of your wealth and your ally ... and who has strengthened among you and lived with you an age.*\nWhen this poetry reached them, they returned him and honored him. He remained among them for a period, until they found him composing love poetry about their women. So they agreed to kill him. They took him while he was drinking, drunk. A woman of them mocked him while he was in that state, gloating over him. He said:\n*If you mock me, then oh how many a night ... I made you in it like the slit tunic.*\nThey said: And the one they accused him with passed by. He extended his hand to her, so they struck him. He said:\n*If you kill me, you kill me while there has flowed ... for her sweat upon the bed and water.*\nSo they tightened the bonds of the slave for killing. He said:\n*Tighten the bonds of the slave, let him not escape you ... Indeed life is close to death.*\n*And sweat has descended from the forehead of your girl ... upon the back of the bed, and perfume.*\nSo he was killed. They said: And he had recited to Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him:",

Is this the one who makes the beautiful women weep out of passion?*\n*She pointed with her comb and said to her peer ... Is it the slave of Banu al-Has-has driving the rhymes?*\n*She saw a shabby saddle and an old cloak ... and a black one, of what people own, suffering.*\n*They comb peoples and leave my hair ... and that is an apparent humiliation that has appeared to me.*\n*If I were rose in his color, they would have loved me ... but my Lord shamed me with my blackness.*\n*And it did not harm me if my mother was a slave girl ... tying and trimming the ties for the milch camels.*\n*They went with my tooth-stick and threw a gilded ... of jewelry onto the smallest finger of my left hand.*\n*So I consoled myself and avoided my error ... and brought close a lean one of the white camels, swift.*\n*Going in the evening when the day fasted as if ... I clothed my saddle with a pure color, lean.*\n*A bull whom the dogs avoided an avoidance ... he is the lion, attacked and attacking.*\n*Protected him in the evening a night of cold ... in a soft sand or at Arnan, empty.*\n*He stirs and reveals roots as if they are ... the reins of a cobbler, new and old.*\n*He pushes dust from a sleeping place and a lair ... a pile like the house of the pharmacist, near.*\n*So the archer from Al-Ghawth came to him in the morning ... with his dogs, inciting the trained dogs.*\n*So he roamed on his off-side and you think him ... on his back a new Yemeni Sab (cloth).*\n*He defends the defense of the five-day thirsty ones when appeared ... their fore-ones of dogs covering.*\n*So leave this, but do you see the light of a lightning ... illuminating a accumulated cloud, rising high.*\n*Its light illuminates the hills, the hills of Mutali' ... and how beloved is that lightning if it were near.*\n*I enjoyed it in mind and became certain that it ... brings down the ibexes and the anchored rocks.*\n*So the wind did not move it until I thought it ... at Harrat Layla or at Nakhlah, staying.*\n*So it passed over the stream-beds and its rain became thick ... and it split [with rain] long, pouring the water quiet.*\n*Accumulated, pouring the water after every milk-gathering time ... as you watered the hoof-injured, barefoot.*\n*So it passed over the mountains, the mountains of Tayy ... and left at Al-Qa'yan turbid and pure [water].*\n*Hoarse, rumbling, its torrent pushing ... you see the wood of the valleys floating in it.*\n*It has separated ones giving birth around it ... bursting in the soft lowlands the burrows.*\n*When it hung down to the mountains and their people ... and the people of Euphrates, it crossed the sea passing.*\n*It complained its grief and raged until I thought it ... from the distance when the thunder rumbled, a camel driver.*\n*So the bulls became drowned and became ... the women of Tamim picking up the horns.*\n\nGhazal Poem of Jarran al-'Awd al-Numayri\nThey said: Among the chosen preferred Ghazal poems is the poem of Jarran al-'Awd al-Numayri. He was nicknamed Jarran al-'Awd only because of his saying to his two wives:\n*Take caution, O my two neighbors, for I ... saw the Jarran (front neck) of the old camel has almost become fit.*\nMeaning a whip he cut from the Jarran of an old camel. Jarran al-'Awd was a flirt, a describer; he describes and exceeds in his amorous poetry. Among what he lied in is his saying:\n*So there became, where we met, a spoil ... a bracelet and an anklet and a Mirt (garment) and a Mutraf (cloak).*\n*And cut pieces of necklaces they left ... like the ember of Ghadha in some of what is snatched.*\n\nThe Poem\n*I remembered youth so the eye poured shedding ... and the longing you used to know returned to you.*\n*And my heart had sobered, then agitated it ... ash-colored pigeons at Medina, cooing.*\n*As if the Hadil, limping of leg in their midst ... from oppression, is a heavy drinker, trilling, drained.*\n*They remind us of our days at Suwayqah ... and the two hills of Qasas, and remembering excites.*\n*And white women jingling the anklets as if they are ... foster-daughters of the virgin wild cows, familiar.*",

He said: I, Al-Farazdaq, and Kuthayyir Azzah were sitting in the mosque reciting poetry to each other and mentioning the days of the Arabs. A boy appeared, slender, dark-skinned, in two reddish-yellow garments. He headed towards us until he reached us, did not greet, and said: \"Which of you is Al-Farazdaq?\" Ibrahim said: I said to him, fearing he might be from Quraysh: \"And thus you speak to the master of the Arabs and their poet?\" He said: \"If he were so, I would not have said this to him.\" Al-Farazdaq said to him: \"Who are you, may you have no mother?\" He said: \"A man from the Ansar, then from Banu al-Najjar, then I am the son of Abu Bakr ibn Hazm.\" He said: \"I am Al-Farazdaq, so what is your need, may you have no mother?\" He said: \"It reached me that you claim you are the most poetic of the Arabs, and Mudar claims it. Our companion Hassan ibn Thabit has said poetry, so I wanted to present it to you, and give you a year for it. If you say the like of it, then you are the most poetic of the Arabs, otherwise you are a lying plagiarist.\" Al-Farazdaq said: \"Bring it, woe to you.\" So he recited to him the saying of Hassan:\n*Did you not ask the new quarter that spoke ... at the flow of Ashdakh then the sandy ground of Azlam.*\n*We have the white bowls shining in the forenoon ... and our swords dripping blood from bravery.*\n*Whenever we are weighed from Ma'add against a group ... and Ghassan, we prevent our basin from being demolished.*\n*Our doing of good refused that we speak obscenity ... and our sayer of kindness except generosity.*\n*We begot Banu al-Anqa' and the two sons of Muharraq ... so how noble we are as maternal uncle and how noble is this as a son.*\nUntil he came to the end of the poem, and said: \"I have given you a year in it.\" Then he left. Al-Farazdaq stood up angry dragging his cloak, not knowing where its end was, until he exited the mosque. He turned to Kuthayyir Azzah and said: \"May Allah fight the Ansari! How eloquent is his dialect and how clear his argument.\" He said: We did not cease in their talk for the rest of our day. Until when it was tomorrow, I went out from my house to the mosque, and sat in the gathering I was in yesterday. Kuthayyir came to me and sat with me, and we were remembering Al-Farazdaq and saying: Would that I knew what Al-Farazdaq did. Suddenly he appeared to us in a suit of striped cloth, having two locks of hair, until he sat in his place of yesterday. Then he said: \"What did the Ansari do?\" We criticized him and insulted him. He said: \"May Allah fight him! I have never been pelted with his like, nor heard the like of his poetry ever. I parted from you two and came to my house, and began ascending and descending in every art of poetry, so I was as if I were silenced, never having said poetry. Until when the Muezzin called for Fajr, I saddled my she-camel, then took her rein and led her until I came to Dhubab. Then I called at the top of my voice: Answer your brother Abu Lubayna. So my chest boiled as the cauldron boils. I hobbled my she-camel, then pillowed on her arm. When I stood up, I said one hundred and thirteen verses.\" While Al-Farazdaq was reciting, the Ansari appeared. He approached us until when he reached us, he greeted then said: \"Behold, I did not come to you to rush you from the deadline I set for you, but I loved not to see you except I ask you what you did.\" Al-Farazdaq said to him: \"Sit, may you have no mother.\" Then he recited to him:\n*You abstained at A'shash and you almost did not abstain.*\nWhen he finished it, he said to him: \"You have heard, may you have no mother. So you and what you heard.\" The Ansari stood up dejected. When he disappeared, his father, Abu Bakr ibn Hazm, appeared to us in a group of Sheikhs of the Ansar. They greeted us and said: \"O Abu Firas, you have known our state and our place from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and his recommendation of us. It has reached us that a fool of our fools exposed himself to you with what we, by Allah, hate, and with you and from it we are above. We ask you by Allah for what you preserved of the recommendation of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, regarding us, that you gift us to him, and that there be nothing from you that does not befit you.\" Ibrahim said: So I and Kuthayyir began speaking to him, and people from the sides of the mosque spoke: \"O Abu Firas.\" When they increased upon him, he said: \"I have gifted you to this Qurashi,\" meaning Ibrahim ibn Muhammad.\n\nThe Poem, poem of Al-Farazdaq",

It is said that Jarir is the starter, and the first is more likely, because of what Jarir used to say that he never satirized except answering and victorious.\nThe narrators mentioned that Jarir came to Basra during the emirate of Al-Hakam ibn Ayyub ibn al-Hakam ibn Abi Aqil, the deputy of Al-Hajjaj. He said praising Al-Hakam:\n*You came from Najran or the two sides of Khaym ... on young camels like the ropes of Salam trees.*\n*Their bellies were folded the folding of leather ... digging a digging like the lost of servants.*\n*If they crossed a landmark, a landmark appeared ... until we reached the door of Al-Hakam.*\n*The deputy of Al-Hajjaj, not the accused ... in the mine of glory and the center of generosity.*\nHe recited it to him and spoke about him. His wit and poetry pleased him. So he wrote to Al-Hajjaj: That a Bedouin, a calamity, a devil of the devils, came to me. He wrote back to send him to me. So he came to him, and he honored him, clothed him, and lodged him. He stayed for days, then he sent for him after his sleep. The messenger said: Answer the Emir. He said: I will wear my clothes. They said: We were ordered to bring you to him in the state we find you in. So his mind went. He was wearing a thick shirt and a dyed sheet. When a man of the messengers saw what was with him, he said: No harm on you, the Emir only called you for conversation. Jarir said: When I entered upon him, he said: \"Well, O enemy of Allah, you insult the honors of people.\" I said: \"May Allah amend the Emir, indeed I, by Allah, do not wrong them, but they wrong me so I defend myself. What do I have, may Allah amend the Emir, with Ibn Umm Ghassan? And what do I have with Al-Ba'ith? And what do I have with Al-Farazdaq? And what do I have with Al-Akhtal? And what do I have with Al-Taymi?\" He said: \"I do not know what you have with them.\" I said: \"I inform the Emir. As for Ghassan ibn Dhuhayl, he is a man from my people; he satirized me and my clan, and he was a poet.\" He said: \"So what did he say to you?\" He said: I said: He said to me:\n*By my life, if Bajila was adorned by ... Jarir, indeed her Jarir has disgraced Kulayb.*\nHe said: \"So what did you say to him?\" He said: I said:\n*If only I knew about Sulayt, did not ... Sulayt find other than Ghassan a neighbor to protect her?*",

It was said that Al-Ra'i had some of Uthman's camels. So he returned to him the next year and recited to him:\n*As for the poor man whose milch-camel was ... sufficient for the family, he left no fur for him.*\n*And the possessor of wealth became deficient, and the rich, there remained ... upon the hardships from their wealth, knots.*\n*If you raise a head by them, you revive them ... and if they meet the like of it next year, they spoil.*\nAbd al-Malik said: You are this year more intelligent than you were last year.\n\nThe First Poem:\n*What is with your side on the bed, humbled ... is there a mote in your eye or did you want a departure?*\n*When she saw my sleeplessness and the length of my turning ... at night and my connected night.*\n*Khulaydah said: What befell you, and you were not ... after sleep, about tears, an asker.*\n*O Khulaydah, indeed your father, two worries hosted his pillow ... they spent the night as a side and an intruder.*\n*They knocked, so those are my concerns, I entertain them ... with young camels, pregnant like bows, and yearlings.*\n*High of withers, their upper arms inclined ... reddish-white, resembling Shadqam and Jadil.*\n*Hawoziyyah, folded upon their breaths ... the folding of bridges, they have split [teeth] a splitting.*\n*Their elbows were built upon a slippery place ... the tick cannot find a resting place in it.*\n*They were noble camels of Mundhir and Muharriq ... their mothers, and their stallions knocked them.*\n*So as if their untamed one, when you eased her ... was accustomed to the saddle, submissive.*\n*And as if there butted on their chests ... mountain goats at Shabwah that completed and wailed.*\n*The casting of the morning when they go early for a need ... the crawling of the evening when they want a return.*\n*Led [camels] measuring the distance of every desert ... the measuring of weavers, twisted and unraveled.*\n*In a wasteland their heads were anxious in it ... the anxiety of axes when they want removal.*\n*So if the desert presented itself, it left ... dust-colored [ostriches] trotting behind it a trotting.*\n*Loud of song, as if in his chest ... are reeds, and persuasive of yearning, hasty.*\n*And when the forenoon dismounted, she cast him ... so they outstripped his sequel, so he remained trotting.*\n*They follow a fast-handed, brisk she-camel ... she cast a fetus in the crossing of winds.*\n*She came with a possessor of a last breath of six months ... he had died or choked on life a little.*\n*She shook off her armor with a black [tail] for the evening ... the shaking of the ostrich its wet feathers.*\n*They do not take, when they ascend a desert ... except the whiteness of the two Farqads as a guide.*\n*Until they arrived at the completion of five, passing ... very much, the spears inherited it, heavy.*\n*Stagnant [waters], if the buckets sought their drops ... they encountered overlooking the water-source, holes.*\n*They gathered ropes from what their saddles contained ... diverse of origin, you see in them a connector.*\n*So they watered thirsty ones hearing in the evening ... for the water in their bellies a jingling.*\n*Until when the buckets cooled their panting ... and they placed under their girths a remainder.*\n*And they flowed after their refraining with a cud ... from Dhu al-Abariq when they grazed Huqayl.*\n*They sat on their saddles so there followed ... the clamor of the echo, the mutilated of peaks, a walker.*\n*Smooth of pebbles, she spent the night listening above it ... to the noise of sandgrouse at the two banks, descending.*\n*Until when the darkness cleared and she turned ... she saw wild beasts grazing in trackless lands.*\n*And the mirage ran and attached their rears ... a rope whose falling would be a loosening.*\n*And it ran on the hump of the stones so they chased it ... the chase of the stolen herd in Al-Samawah, long.*\n*Convey to the Commander of the Faithful a message ... a complaint to you, overlooking, and a wailing.*\n*From a distant one, his worries multiplied upon him ... if he could find a way to the meeting.*\n*The turning and Time were long, and he was suspicious of ... laziness, and he hates to be lazy.*\n*Worries hosted his pillow and avoided ... a quenched one who becomes heavy in sleep.*\n*So he folded the heart on the decree of a determination ... sharp, and took resolve as a friend.*\n*And gray hair topped his peers, and eras have passed ... undoing his twisted rope.*\n*As if his bones are hooks of Nab' wood ... crooked, old, for they wanted emaciation.*\n*Like the iron of the Indian sword, its sheath became ... worn, and it was not in the bones recoiling.*",

    "text": "They narrated that Ka'b bin Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma Al-Muzani wrote to his brother Bujair—who was in Medina with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), having preceded him in converting to Islam and finding guidance—scolding him with these verses:\n\n'Who will convey a message to Bujair from me? ... Woe to you! Is what I said acceptable to you?\nYou drank from a cup with the family of Muhammad ... And the Trusted One [Al-Ma'mun] gave you a first and second drink from it.\nSo you opposed the reasons of guidance and abandoned it ... To what thing—woe to other than you—did he guide you?\nTo a nature upon which you found neither a mother nor a father ... And upon which no father of yours was found.'\n\nThey said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'Indeed, he found neither his father nor his mother upon it.'\n\nBujair answered him, saying:\n'Who will convey to Ka'b: Is the path acceptable to you ... Which you blame falsely, while it is the most prudent?\nTo Allah alone—not Al-Uzza nor Al-Lat ... You will be saved, if there is to be salvation, and be safe.\nOn a Day when no one will be saved or escape ... From the Fire, except the pure-hearted Muslim.\nFor the religion of Zuhayr is nothing but distinct from it ... And the religion of Abu Sulma is forbidden to me.'\n\nKa'b had insulted the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) in some of his poetry. When the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) returned from the conquest of Ta'if, he intended to kill those among the polytheist poets who used to hurt him, such as Umayyah bin Khalaf, Ibn Al-Zib'ara, and Ka'b bin Zuhayr.\n\nSo Bujair sent word to him: 'Take caution and save yourself by fleeing the land, for he has intended to kill those who hurt him with their poetry, unless you come to him as a repentant Muslim.'\n\nKa'b went to the Muzaynah tribe, but they refused to shelter him. He proceeded until he reached Medina and stayed with a man he knew. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) passed by, and the man said, 'This is the Messenger of Allah; go to him and ask for security.' Ka'b went to him until he sat before him, placed his hand in the Prophet's hand—and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not recognize him—and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, Ka'b bin Zuhayr has come to ask for your security as a repentant Muslim. Will you accept it from him if I bring him to you?' He said, 'Yes.' Ka'b said, 'I am, O Messenger of Allah, Ka'b bin Zuhayr,' and he recited to him:\n\nThe Poem of Ka'b bin Zuhayr:\n\n'Su'ad has departed, so my heart today is lovesick ... Enslaved after her, unransomed and shackled.\nAnd what was Su'ad, on the morning of separation when they departed ... But a gazelle with a nasal twang, with lowered eyes heavily organized with kohl.\nShe reveals side-teeth of distinct darkness when she smiles ... As if it is a watering place mixed with wine.\nMixed with cold water from a bend in the valley ... Clear, in a pebbled riverbed, which the north wind has chilled.\nThe winds banish floating debris from it, and it is overfilled ... By the downpour of white passing clouds.\nOh, what a friend she would be if she were true ... To her promise, or if advice were accepted [by her].\nBut she is a friend in whose blood is mixed ... Pain, deception, breaking promises, and fickleness.\nShe does not remain in a state she is in ... Except as the Ghoul changes colors in her clothes.\nShe does not hold to the vow she claimed ... Except as sieves hold water.\nSo let not what she wished and promised deceive you ... For hopes and dreams are misleading.\nThe consequences of Urqoub were a proverb for her ... And her promises are nothing but falsehoods.\nI hope and expect that her affection will draw near ... But meant for them throughout time is no attainment.\nSu'ad has ended up in a land that cannot be reached ... Except by noble, swift, thoroughbred she-camels.\nAnd nothing will reach her except a strong she-camel ... That trots and paces despite fatigue.\nFrom every sweater behind the ears; when she sweats ... Her intersection implies a road whose markers are obliterated and unknown.\nShe looks at the unknown with the eyes of a solitary white oryx ... When the rocky terrain and the milestones burn with heat.\nHuge is her neck, sturdy are her fetlocks ... In her creation, she surpasses the daughters of the stallion.\nA lean camel, whose brother is her father from a noble sire ... And her uncle is her maternal uncle; long-necked and swift.\nThe tick walks upon her, then slips ... Off her due to a smooth chest and smooth flanks.\nAn onager-like camel, flesh is thrown off her sides ... Her elbow is twisted away from the ribs of the chest.\nIt is as if what lies between her eyes and her throat ... From her nose and jawbones is a pickaxe.\nShe passes like a palm branch with clusters ... In a barren udder not betrayed by milkers.\nShe has a hooked nose; in the tips of her ears to the one who sees her ... Is a clear nobility, and in the cheeks is smoothness.\nShe trots on left legs while she overtakes ... With withered legs that have barely touched the ground.\nBrown shanks that leave the pebbles scattered ... With four hooves not hindered by the hills, hard as horseshoes.'",

Into the palm of an Avenger whose word is the final word.\nFor he is more feared by me when I speak to him ... And it was said, 'Indeed you are examined and questioned,'\nThan a lion from the forest thickets, whose den ... Is in the belly of 'Aththar; thicket upon thicket surrounds it.\nHe goes out early and feeds two lion cubs whose sustenance is ... Flesh from the people, covered in dust, cut into pieces.\nIf he attacks an adversary, it is not lawful for him ... To leave the adversary unless he is broken.\nFrom him, the wild donkeys remain silent ... And men do not walk in his valley.\nAnd there remains in his valley a trusted brother [prey] ... Whose weapons and tattered clothes are cast aside, eaten.\nIndeed, the Messenger is a sword to be illuminated by ... Drawn from the swords of Allah, sharp.\nIn a group from Quraysh, whose spokesperson said ... In the valley of Mecca when they converted: 'Depart.'\nThey departed, but no weaklings departed, nor those defenseless ... At the meeting [of battle], nor those who lean away unarmed.\nHigh-nosed [proud], heroes, their clothing is ... From the weave of David; shirts of mail in battle.\nWhite, ample armor, whose rings have been pierced ... As if they are the rings of the Qaf'aa plant, woven together.\nThey walk the walk of white camels; protecting them is ... A strike when the black, short men flee.\nThey do not rejoice [arrogantly] if their spears hit ... A people, nor are they anxious if they are hit.\nThe stabbing does not fall except in their throats ... They have no hesitation from the basins of death.'",
