    "text": "Category: Countries and Journeys\nBook: Description of the Arabian Peninsula (Sifat Jazirat al-Arab)\nAuthor: Ibn al-Ha'ik, Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn Ya'qub ibn Yusuf ibn Dawud, known as Al-Hamdani (died 334 AH)\nDate of Publication in Shamela: 8 Dhu al-Hijjah 1431\n\n[Repeated metadata omitted for brevity]\n\nThe middle of the Equator is the Dome of the Earth which is under the Dome of the Celestial Sphere - meaning the apex of the Earth's sphere. The horizon circle of the Dome cuts the sky in half above and half below. The Earth is divided according to that form into two parts: visible and hidden. Thus, they become four parts: Upper Northern, Lower Northern, Upper Southern, and Lower Southern. The division is the horizon circle in these places. In what is on its line in two equal halves, the days become like the nights exactly equal, and the hours are always twelve of the night and the day. The shadow at the head (start) of Aries and Libra is non-existent. When the sun inclines in the north to the head of Cancer, its shadows fall to the north. The limit of the summer and winter shadow there is five digits (fingers) and a third of a digit. The wandering planets (planets) align with them if they are at the vernal point and the autumnal point. Among the fixed stars, those whose orbit is on the path of the day - meaning the Equator. They see all the stars rising and setting since the pole of the sphere is on their horizon circle itself. It is likely that these places on Earth are at the utmost moderation of temperament. That is because the sun does not linger long over them at the points that are directly overhead, due to the speed of its movement from the two equinox points in declination, because it is at the beginning of the declination arc, so it takes a degree in longitude and [changes] declination for most of it. It does not distance from them more than the degrees of declination, which is twenty-four parts less a sixth. Thus, summer and winter there are of moderate temperament. He said: As for the dwellings in these lands on this line, I am not able to say about that what I do not encompass with knowledge, because no one from among us has reached them up to this limit. What is said about them is closer to running the course of conjecture than running the course of news from observation. These are the properties of the Equator and the Great Circle which is under the Equinoctial Line (Celestial Equator) in summary. Whatever deviates from this circle south and north, the two poles differ upon it, so one appears and one is hidden. Thereby stars appear that become eternally visible, and stars are hidden that become eternally hidden, among those close to the two poles. The horizon circles divide the circles aligning with these two halves into two different parts: from above and below. The upper is greater and longer in day, and the lower is [more transparent?] and shorter in night in alignment only. As for on the second half of each half, it is the reverse. That is, the circles of the northern land aligning [with the sun] are cut by their horizons visibly at the larger of the two parts, due to their alignment with the circles aligning with the people of the south visibly at the smaller of the two parts. So the day shortens for them if the sun is in the circles of the south. And likewise it does in the south if it shifts by its declination to the north. Wherever one of the poles appears, there must be stars upon it that are eternally visible, and wherever it is hidden, there must be stars upon it that are eternally hidden. The first circle is finished. He said: As for the Second Parallel Circle: It is the one where the maximum day reaches twelve and a quarter hours of the equinoctial hours - meaning equal hours. The distance of the circle from the circle of the Equinoctial Line is four parts and a quarter of a part. It is drawn passing through the island named Taprobane [Sri Lanka]. This circle is among the circles where the shadow falls to both directions if the sun also becomes directly overhead for everyone under it twice. Such is the way of what is under the two arrows of declination from the head of Cancer and the head of Capricorn to the chord aligning with the Equator. The shadow of the head of Aries in this circle is fifty-three minutes and fifteen seconds of a digit. The gnomons fall under it, and the shadow falls if the sun is between ten and a half parts of Aries to nineteen parts and a half and twenty-four seconds, and that is in one hundred and fifty-nine degrees, which is what is between the two positions we defined in Aries and Virgo. Its longest shadow in winter is six digits and twenty-four minutes and thirty-six seconds of a digit, and that is from nineteen and a half parts of the parts of Virgo to ten and a half parts of the beginning of Aries; that is two hundred and one degrees. It has no shadow at times of the sun culminating the sky on this line.\n\nThe Third Parallel Circle: It is the circle where the longest day becomes twelve and a half hours. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line and the Equator is eight parts and twenty-five minutes. It is drawn passing through the gulf called Avalites (Gulf of Aden?). This circle is also among the circles where the shadow falls to both directions if the sun becomes directly overhead for those living under it twice. The gnomons in it, if the sun's distance from the Summer Solstice is sixty-nine parts to each of the two directions - meaning between twenty-one degrees of Aries to nine degrees of Virgo - have no shadow at times of the sun culminating the sky over them. If the sun is moving in these one hundred and thirty-eight parts, the fall of the gnomons' shadows is to the south of it. If its movement is in the remaining parts - which are two hundred and twenty-two parts - the fall of the shadows is to the north of it. The shadow of the head of Aries in it is one digit and forty-six minutes and twenty-five seconds of a digit. The amount of its shadow in the Summer Solstice is three digits and eighteen minutes and thirty-eight seconds of a digit. The shadow of the Winter Solstice from the head of Capricorn in it is seven digits and eighty-four minutes and forty-eight seconds of a digit. The Fourth Parallel Circle: It is the one where the amount of the longest day becomes twelve and a half hours and a quarter of an hour. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line is twelve parts and a half part. It is drawn passing through the gulf called Aduliticus (Gulf of Zula?). This circle is also among the circles where the shadow falls to both directions if the sun becomes directly overhead for those living under it also twice. The gnomons in it, if the sun's distance from the Summer Solstice in the head of Cancer to each of the two directions is fifty-seven parts and two-thirds of a part, have no shadow at times of the sun culminating the sky over them. So as long as the sun moves in these one hundred and fifteen parts and a third of a part - meaning between two degrees and a third of Taurus to twenty-seven degrees and two-thirds of Leo - the fall of the gnomons' shadows is to the south of it. If its movement is in the remaining parts of the sphere, which are two hundred and forty-four parts and two-thirds of a part, it is therein to the north of it. The shadow of the head of Aries on this location is two digits and thirty-nine minutes and thirty seconds of a digit. The limit of the summer shadow in the head of Cancer: two digits and twenty-four minutes and thirty-three seconds of a digit. The limit in the winter shadow in the head of Capricorn: eight digits and five-sixths of a digit.\n\nThe Fifth Parallel Circle: It is the one where the amount of the longest day becomes thirteen hours. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line is sixteen parts and twenty-seven minutes. It is drawn passing through the island named Meroe - meaning Ma'rib the land of Sheba. This circle is also among the circles where the shadow falls to both directions as the sun becomes directly overhead for those living under it twice. The gnomons in it, if the sun's distance from the Summer Solstice - meaning the head of Cancer to each of the two directions - is forty-five parts, have no shadow at times of the sun culminating the sky aligning with it - meaning with these parts from half of Taurus to the beginning of Cancer to half of the sign of Leo. If the sun is moving in these ninety parts, the fall of the shadows is to the south of it. If its movement is in the remaining parts of the sphere - which are two hundred and seventy parts - the fall of the shadows is to the north. The shadow of the head of Aries on this location is three digits and thirty-two minutes and eighteen seconds. The shadow of the head of Cancer on it is one digit and thirty-three minutes and twelve seconds. The shadow of the head of Capricorn on it is ten digits and ten minutes and thirty-six seconds of a digit. The Sixth Parallel Circle: It is the one where the amount of the longest day becomes thirteen and a quarter hours of the equal hours. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line is twenty parts and fourteen minutes. It is drawn passing through the places named Napata - meaning parts of the First Clime in what overlooks Mecca. This circle is also among the circles where the shadow falls to both directions if the sun becomes directly overhead in it twice. The gnomons at midday, if the sun's distance from the Summer Solstice to each of its directions is thirty-one parts - meaning the last part of Taurus and the first part of Leo - the sun has no shadow in these two parts, and they are in alignment with this location. If it passes from these two parts in the north, the shadows fall in the south. If its movement is in the remaining parts of the sphere, which are two hundred and ninety-eight parts, the fall of the shadows is to the north. The shadow of the head of Aries in this location is four digits and twenty minutes and sixteen seconds. On the head of Cancer, forty-five minutes and fourteen seconds of a digit. The shadow of the head of Capricorn is eleven digits and thirty-seven minutes and five seconds of a digit.\n\nThe Seventh Parallel Circle: It is the one where the amount of the longest day becomes thirteen and a half hours of the equal hours. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line is twenty-three parts and fifty-one minutes. It is the direction of the maximum declination. It is drawn passing through the island named Syene - meaning Hejaz. This circle is the first of the circles called 'those of one shadow'. That is because the shadows of gnomons at midday do not fall for those living under it at any time to the south; rather, the sun at the Summer Solstice itself only becomes directly overhead, and no shadow is seen for the gnomons then. That is because their distance from the Equinoctial Line is the distance of the Summer Solstice from it. As for all the rest of the time, the shadows of the gnomons fall for them to the north. The shadow of the head of Aries in this place is five digits and eighteen minutes and forty-five seconds of a digit. There is no shadow for the head of Cancer as we mentioned due to its alignment with this position. The shadow of the head of Capricorn on it is thirteen digits and eleven minutes and thirty-six seconds of a digit. All circles that are more inclined to the north than this circle have no southern shadow to the furthest north since the sun does not reach them. The Eighth Parallel Circle: It is the one where the amount of the longest day becomes thirteen and a half hours and a quarter of the equal hours. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line is twenty-seven parts and a fifth of a part. It is drawn passing through the city named Ptolemais, which is known as Hermopolis in the land of Thebais. The shadow of the head of Aries in this location is six digits and ten minutes and twelve seconds of a digit. The summer shadow in the head of Cancer is forty-two [minutes] and twelve seconds of a digit. The winter shadow on it in the head of Capricorn is fourteen digits and fifty minutes and thirty-seven seconds of a digit.\n\nThe Ninth Parallel Circle: It is the one where the amount of the longest day becomes fourteen hours of the equal hours. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line is thirty parts and twenty-two minutes. It is drawn passing through the lower land of Egypt and what surrounds it east and west. The shadow of the head of Aries in this location is seven digits and two minutes and fourteen seconds of a digit. The summer shadow from the head of Cancer is one digit and twenty-two minutes and twelve seconds of a digit. The winter shadow from the head of Capricorn is sixteen digits and thirty-nine minutes and fourteen seconds of a digit. The Tenth Parallel Circle: It is the one where the longest day becomes fourteen and a quarter hours of the equal hours. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line is thirty-three parts and eighteen minutes. It is drawn passing through the middle of the land of Sham (Levant).

The shadow of the head of Capricorn in it is twenty digits and thirty-nine minutes and thirty-nine seconds of a digit.\n\nThe Twelfth Parallel Circle: It is the one where the amount of the longest day becomes fourteen and a half hours and a quarter of the equal hours. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line is thirty-eight parts and thirty-five minutes. It is drawn passing through the island named Smyrna. The shadow of the head of Aries in it is nine digits and thirty-three minutes and twenty-five seconds of a digit. The summer shadow of the head of Cancer is three digits and sixteen seconds of a digit. The summer shadow of the head of Cancer is three digits and sixteen seconds of a digit [repeated].

The limit of the winter shadow in it is thirty-four digits and seventeen minutes and six seconds. The Seventeenth Parallel Circle: It is the one where the amount of the longest day becomes sixteen equal hours. The distance of this circle from the Equinoctial Line is forty-eight parts and thirty-two minutes. It is drawn passing through the outlets of the river named Borysthenes (Dnieper).

The shadow of the head of Aries there is 20, 25, 3. The shadow of the head of Cancer is 8, 36, 21. And the shadow of the head of Capricorn.\n\nHe said: We did not use the quarter-hour details in these places because the parallel circles become close together and connected to each other at that time, and the difference in elevations does not amount to even one complete part. Also, it is not necessary for us to investigate the matter of the circles that are more inclined to the north than the circles we mentioned in the same way we investigated the explanation of those circles. Therefore, we saw fit to also set down the ratio of gnomons to shadows in them as they are set down, and as we did in the known defined places of the section. As for the place where the amount of the longest day is nineteen hours of the equal hours, the distance of its parallel circle from the Equinoctial Line is sixty-one parts. It is drawn passing through the northern extremities of the land of Little Britannia. No shadow was mentioned, so we knew it. The shadow of the head of Aries there is twenty-one digits and thirty-nine minutes of a digit. The shadow of the head of Cancer is nine digits and five minutes and thirty-three seconds of a digit. The shadow of the head of Capricorn is one hundred and thirty-three digits. The place where the amount of the longest day is nineteen and a half hours of the equal hours, the distance of its parallel circle from the Equinoctial Line is sixty-two parts. It is drawn passing through the island named Ebuda (Hebrides), which is Ournqa [?]. No shadow was mentioned. The shadow of the head of Aries there is twenty-two digits and thirty-four minutes of a digit. The shadow of the head of Cancer is nine digits and twenty-three minutes and twenty-seven seconds of a digit. The shadow of the head of Capricorn is one hundred and sixty-six digits and twenty-five minutes and fifty-seven seconds of a digit. The place where the amount of the longest day is twenty hours of the equal hours, the distance of its parallel circle from the Equinoctial Line is sixty-three parts. It is drawn passing through the island named Thule. No shadow was mentioned. The shadow of the head of Aries there is twenty-three digits and thirty-three minutes of a digit. The shadow of the head of Cancer is nine digits and forty-six minutes and nine seconds of a digit. The shadow of the head of Capricorn is two hundred and twenty digits and twenty-three minutes and twenty-four seconds of a digit.\n\nThe place where the amount of the longest day is twenty-one hours of the equal hours, the distance of its parallel circle from the Equinoctial Line is sixty-four parts and a half part. It is drawn passing through nations unknown and not counted among the Slavs. No shadow was mentioned. The shadow of the head of Aries there is twenty-five digits and a sixth of a digit. The shadow of the head of Cancer is ten digits... The shadow of the head of Capricorn is four hundred and sixty-four digits and twenty-two minutes and forty-eight seconds of a digit. The place where the amount of the longest day is twenty-two hours of the equal hours, the distance of that parallel circle from the Equinoctial Line is sixty-five parts and a half part. The shadow of the head of Aries there is twenty-six digits and twenty minutes and thirty seconds of a digit. The shadow of the head of Cancer is ten digits and forty minutes and eighteen seconds. The shadow of the head of Capricorn is one thousand one hundred and fifty digits and seventeen minutes and nine seconds of a digit. The place where the amount of its longest days is twenty-three hours of the equal hours, the distance of the parallel circle upon it from the Equinoctial Line is sixty-six parts. The shadow of the head of Aries there is twenty-six digits and fifty-seven minutes of a digit. The shadow of the head of Cancer is ten digits and fifty-one minutes and twenty-seven seconds. There is no limit to the shadow of Capricorn. The place where the amount of the longest day is twenty-four hours of the equal hours, the distance of its parallel circle from the Equinoctial Line is sixty-six parts and a half part. He said: This is the first of the circles where the shadow falls circulating around the gnomon and everything upright. That is because the sun, since it does not set there at the Summer Solstice alone - meaning the head of Cancer - the shadows of the gnomons fall to all directions of the horizon. In this place, the circle of the Summer Solstice parallel to the Equinoctial Line is permanently visible, and the circle of the Winter Solstice parallel to the Equinoctial Line is permanently hidden, because they both touch the horizon in it alternately. The oblique circle also which passes through the middle of the signs becomes the horizon if the ascendant from it is the point of the Vernal Equinox - i.e., the head of Aries.\n\nHe said: If a lover of increasing knowledge wishes to investigate in another way the circles that are more inclined to the north than the circles we mentioned regarding some of the generalities required in them, he would find the place where the elevation of the North Pole is approximately sixty-seven parts - which is its distance from the Equinoctial Line that is the belt of the Equator - there, fifteen parts of the circle passing through the middle of the signs do not set, which are on each of the two sides of the head of Cancer - meaning from the middle of Gemini to the middle of Cancer - such that the amount of the longest day there and the rotation of shadows to all directions of the horizon is close to one month. Where the elevation of the Pole is sixty-nine parts and a half part, you find there thirty parts on each of the two sides of the Summer Solstice that do not set at all - meaning from the beginning of Gemini to the end of Cancer - such that the longest day there and the rotation of the gnomons' shadows is close to two months. Where the elevation of the Pole and the distance of the parallel circle from the Equinoctial Line is seventy-three parts and a third of a part, you find there forty-five parts from each of the two sides of the Summer Solstice that do not set - meaning between the middle of Taurus and the middle of Leo - such that the amount of the longest day there and the rotation of the gnomons' shadows extends to close to three months. Where the elevation of the Pole is seventy-eight parts and a third of a part, you find there sixty parts from each of the two sides of the Summer Solstice that do not set, which are from the beginning of Taurus to the end of Leo, such that the amount of the longest day there and the rotation of the gnomons' shadows is close to four months. Where the elevation of the Pole is eighty-four parts, you find there seventy-five parts from each of the two sides of the Summer Solstice that do not set, which are from the middle of Aries to the middle of Virgo, such that the amount of the longest day there is close to five months, and the shadows of the gnomons rotate around it for close to this period of time.\n\nWhere the North Pole is elevated above the horizon by the parts of the quarter entirely, which are ninety parts, there the entire half of the circles passing through the middle of the signs that is more inclined to the north from the circle of the Equinoctial Line does not become under the earth at any time. And the half that is more inclined to the south entirely does not become above the earth at any time, so that every year becomes a single day and a single night, each one of them close to six months. The shadows of the gnomons at all times rotate around it. Among the properties of this inclination to the North Pole is that the Peg (Watad) - meaning the Pole - is at the zenith, and that the circle of the Equinoctial Line stands there in the place of the permanently visible circle, and the place of the permanently hidden circle, and the place of the horizon circle, as it makes the entire half of the sphere that is more inclined from it to the north above the earth at all times, and the half that is more inclined to the south below the earth - meaning that the point of the North Pole is the middle of the sky of the place and the point of the South Pole is its lower peg.\n\nAll of this which he mentioned is according to him in eleven categories and eleven methods. The First Method: The Erect Sphere, its hours are twelve equal hours, which is the orbit of the Equator. The Second Method: The Gulf named Avalites, its hours are twelve and a half hours, and its latitude is eight degrees and a third of a degree and half a sixth. This is what is between the Equator and the start of the First Clime; he made this method part of it. The Third Method: The Island named Meroe, which is Yemen, the First Clime; its hours are thirteen hours, and its latitude is sixteen parts and a quarter and a fifth. The Fourth Method: The Island named Syene - meaning Hejaz; its hours are thirteen and a half, and its latitude is the cut of the declination which is twenty-three degrees and fifty-one minutes. The Fifth Method: The lower parts of the land of Egypt; its hours are fourteen hours, and its latitude is thirty parts and a fifth and a sixth of a part. The Sixth Method: The Island named Rhodes, which is Babylon; its hours are fourteen and a half hours, its latitude is thirty-six parts. The Seventh Method: The lands named Hellespontus; its hours are fifteen, and its latitude is forty parts and nine-tenths and a third of a tenth of a part. The Eighth Method: In the middle of the Pontus Sea (Black Sea); its hours are fifteen and a half, forty-five parts. The Ninth Method: At the outlets of the river named Borysthenes; its hours are sixteen, and its latitude is forty-eight parts and a half and a third of a tenth. The Tenth Method: At the furthest south of the lands of Britannia; its hours are sixteen and a half hours, and its latitude is fifty-one parts and a half. The Eleventh Method: At the outlets of the Tanais; its hours are seventeen, and its distance is fifty-four parts and a sixth of a tenth. The Climes from these Seven Methods are: The Island named Meroe, which is Yemen, is of the First Clime. The second is the Island named Syene. The third is the lower parts of the land of Egypt. The fourth is the Island of Rhodes. The fifth is the lands named Hellespontus. The sixth is the middle of the Pontus Sea. The seventh is the outlet of the river named Borysthenes. Differences of People regarding Latitude and Longitude.\n\nAs for Latitude, among people are those who count the First Clime from the limit of the chord of the Equator to its furthest limit in the north. Among them are those who make the Zanj Sea (Sea of Zanj) a barrier between the First Clime and the middle of the Equator. That is whose latitude is eight degrees and twenty-five minutes and its hours are twelve and a half. Among the differences in its latitude is what contradicts the calculation of Sana'a in its latitude and the latitude of Ma'rib and their shadow. That is because they mention that the shadow of the head of Aries in Sana'a is three digits and a tenth, and its latitude is fourteen and a half. Ma'rib of Sheba is like that because it is aligned with it on the line of longitudinal azimuth; it is the east of Sana'a and Sana'a is its west, and between them is a distance of two days for a single rider. The elevation of Canopus over it is the calculation of Sana'a. As for the measurement of its longitude by Al-Ma'mun, it might contradict them somewhat. This is evidence that the middle of this Clime is Wadi Najran of the land of Yemen, and Mecca is the last limit of Yemen. What supports their saying is that we find the latitude of the city of Sheba according to Ptolemy is sixteen parts and a quarter and a fifth of a part, and it is as we mentioned. Then we find him making the latitude of Zafar fourteen parts. This measurement of his for Zafar testifies for the calculation of Sana'a because Zafar is on the meridian circle of Sana'a from the south, and between them is approximately three days. Perhaps Ptolemy meant the desert of Ma'rib, land of Sheba, for it is a desert bordered by Bayhan, Ma'rib, Al-Jawf, Najran, Al-Hujayrah, and the valleys of Turabah, Bisha, and Tabalah. The most famous of these places bordering this desert was the city of Sheba.\n\nAs for Longitude, the people of the West among the Greeks and Romans looked at the furthest of their settlements, and that was near the Dark Sea (Atlantic Ocean) taking what is between the north of the West and its south, so they made it the limit. Then they made the end of the longitude in the East at a distance of twelve hours, which is one hundred and eighty straight degrees. Since all the horizon circles of countries cut from the sphere visibly and inwardly at this amount. As for the people of the East from India and those following them and from China and others, they differed from the Greeks. They placed the beginning of the East behind what those placed as the beginning by thirteen degrees and a half, which is the amount of an hour minus a tenth. Then they made the limit of the West short of what its people made by this amount. Each of the two groups came to place the Dome of the Earth, upon which the positions of the stars are calculated, at ninety degrees from the limit they defined. As for the people of the East, they made the beginning of habitation from where a traveler reaches in the extremities of China, like the places a traveler reaches after the limits of the Climes in the North. The first sunrise is on this limit, which is midnight for the people of the Dome upon which the calculation of the Sindhind is placed. So whoever works with Ptolemy's longitudes from among these, he subtracts from his longitudes thirteen degrees and a half so that what remains is the distance of his city from the West. Then he subtracts that from one hundred and eighty. If what remains is less than ninety, his city is behind the Dome towards the East. If more than ninety degrees remain, his city is before the Dome towards the West. If ninety remains, it is under the meridian circle of the Dome. An example of that is that Ptolemy made the longitude of Zafar in Yemen seventy-eight parts. If we subtract it from one hundred and eighty parts, one hundred and two parts remain, which is its longitude from the East according to the limit of the Westerners. The sun rises over it after rising over the people of the Dome by four-fifths of an hour. This amount is for one who takes the saying of Ptolemy. Whoever takes the saying of the people of the Sindhind subtracts from the longitude of Zafar that we mentioned thirteen degrees and a half, so sixty-four degrees and a half remains, which is its longitude from the West according to one who holds the view of the people of the East. If this longitude is subtracted from the longitude of one hundred and eighty, one hundred and fifteen parts and a half remains, which is its longitude from the East. The sun rises over it after rising over the people of the Dome by one equal hour and a half and a fifth of an hour. The longitude of Sana'a when calculating it from the East is one hundred and eighteen parts, which contradicts the longitude of Zafar...\n\naccording to Ptolemy because their longitude can only be one. What came from Claudius Ptolemy regarding the natures of the inhabitants of the populated part of the Earth in general. Since the stars share in the management of the regions of the Earth, mixing between the middle and the edge, it was good composition and flow of the system to mention the whole so that the special and general natures of the Arabian Peninsula are known, and that what the wise men characterized it with, which is present and witnessed in its people, appears. In general, the populated part of the Earth, the upper of its northern quarters, is according to him in three disparate zones (Khabbat). The first zone is what is from the Equator under the courses of the stars to the alignment of the end of the declination from the head of Cancer. That is the direction of what is between Mecca and Medina and what aligns with it east and west. The second zone is from this latitude to what exceeds the declination by its half. That is where the latitude is thirty-six parts from the East to the West. The third zone is from this latitude to the furthest habitation and the alignment from the sphere of the orbit of Ursa Major (Banat Na'sh).\n\nHe said: Those whose dwellings are between the head of Aries and the head of Cancer, which is between the Equator and the middle of Hejaz and what takes its course east and west, it happens to them that the sun burns them by its passing directly over their heads. So their bodies are black, their hair black, curly and thick, their faces parched, their builds slender, their natures hot, and their morals mostly savage due to the persistence of heat in the place of their dwelling and its connection to them. He said: They are the ones we call by the general name Abyssinians (Habash). We do not see them in this state of heat only, but the intense heat appears in the air surrounding them also in the rest of the animals and plants that are with them. Abu Muhammad said: The wise man, although he attributed this zone to the Abyssinians, the Abyssinians are the least of who is in it. In it are those blacker than them, those purer in color than them, and those who differ from all by whiteness and moderation of colors and by brownness and dark complexion, such as the inhabitants of the edge of this zone from China and from the Arabian Peninsula. For that are causes we have mentioned in the book 'Secrets of Wisdom' (Sara'ir al-Hikmah). Ptolemy said: As for those who live under the orbit of Ursa Major, because their distance from the zodiac sphere and from the heat of the sun is great, cold became predominant over them. Since what reaches them of moisture is abundant and rich in nourishment and there is no heat there to dry it, their colors became white, their hair straight (lank), their bodies huge and fertile, and their natures inclined to cold. The morals of these people are also savage due to the persistence of cold in the places of their dwellings and its connection. Whatever is found in them is found in their beasts and fruits, of hugeness, strength, and difference of composition.\n\nAs for those who live in the middle between the orbit of Ursa Major and the orbit of the head of Cancer, since the sun does not reach the place of their zenith - and its distance from them at times of midday is not great, so the temperament of their air was moderate; it might vary but it is not subject to much change from heat to cold and from cold to heat - the colors of these people became medium, the sizes of their bodies moderate, their natures of good temperament, their dwellings connected, and their morals sociable. Whoever of these inclines to the southern direction is mostly more intelligent, more resourceful, and more capable of knowledge of the affairs of the gods due to the proximity of the zodiac sphere and the wandering planets to the place of their zenith. The movements of their souls befit the movements of the stars in the speed of their understanding of a thing, and they are possessing of investigation and examination in the sciences called mathematical - i.e., the science of stars and calculation - as if he means the lower parts of Babylon then the land of Persia, then going to the West to the land of Egypt and the island of Greece. Whoever of them is generally inclined to the eastern direction, they are more remembering and stronger in souls and reveal all their affairs, because the eastern direction is of the nature of the sun, and it is a diurnal, masculine, right-sided direction. As is seen in animals, the right-sided organs of them are stronger and more helpful for intensity and endurance, and the beasts of this direction are stronger, more working, and more patient than others. As for those who incline to the western direction, they are more feminine, their souls are softer, and they hide their affairs mostly and conceal them, because this direction is lunar, and it is the nature of the moon always that its first rising and appearance after conjunction is from the direction of the blowing of the western winds called Al-Dabur. Therefore, this direction is thought to be nocturnal, feminine, left-sided, contrary to the eastern direction. Each one of these total directions must have partial conditions of the conditions of morals and natural laws, just as the conditions of the surrounding air differ in the places we mentioned, hot mostly or cold or moderate mostly. Places and countries among them are singled out by increase and decrease, either due to the rank of the place in position, or due to its elevation and depression, or due to its neighboring what neighbors it. And just as some people are also farmers specifically due to the ease of their land, and others are sailors and navigators due to the proximity of the sea to them, and others are people of ease, comfort, sociability, and wealth due to the fertility of their lands and the abundance of their good; likewise finds...\n\n...man special natures in each of the countries from the natural conformity between the partial Climes and the stars and signs.

The sun rises over it after its rising over the place of the Equator by two equal hours less a third of a fifth of an hour, and after rising over Basra by four-fifths of an hour, which is the amount of twelve straight degrees. If we multiply these degrees by the miles of a degree - which are sixty-six miles and two-thirds of a mile - eight hundred miles result for us. If we divide them by the miles of a stage for a diligent traveler, forty stages result for us.\n\nIf we want to know its length, we subtract the latitude of Aden, which is twelve degrees, from the latitude of thirty-five, leaving what entered from this peninsula to the likes of Tarsus [Turkey] and Mopsuestia (Al-Massisah) [Turkey] and what has a latitude of thirty-six and thirty-seven degrees. There remains for us from the degrees what, if we multiply it by the miles of a degree, results for us in miles one thousand five hundred and thirty-three miles. If we divide them by the miles of a stage for a diligent traveler, seventy-six and two-thirds result for us. This is the length of this peninsula and its stable width from its bottom. As for its width from its top, in the area of Aden Abyan [Yemen] it is little, then the width increases more in it from the eastern side to Hadramaut [Yemen], then the land of Mahra [Yemen/Oman], then Oman.

Thus, the horizon of every people cuts from it differently than the horizon of others cuts, longitudinally and latitudinally, in all habitation. Therefore, stars appear to the people of the South that the people of the North do not see, and stars appear to the people of the North that the people of the South do not see. These [Northerners] have stars that are eternally visible and circling around the pole, while for those [Southerners], they rise and set. I will set for you a clear measure for the common people regarding that. From that is that the altitude of Canopus (Suhayl) in Sana'a [Yemen] and what aligns with it, when it culminates, is more than twenty degrees, and its altitude in Hejaz is near ten, while in Iraq it is only seen on the horizon line, and it is not seen in the land of the North.",

Among the evidence for that: The sun on the two days of Equinox does not align directly overhead (zenith) anyone of the inhabitants of the Earth except those on the Equator, which is the middle belt of the Earth. They are the first inhabitants of the inhabited world from southern China, southern India, the land of Zanj (East Africa), and the Maldive Islands (Al-Dibajat).

Each section is attributed to a section of the Triplicities in nature, because every encompasser [influences] the nature of what it encompasses according to its nature.\nThe first of the Fire Triplicities are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius.\nThe second Earth Triplicity is Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.\nThe third Air Triplicity is Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.\nThe fourth Water Triplicity is Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.\n\nThe Triplicity of Aries is for the North-West; its first governing ruler is Jupiter because it is northerly, then Mars follows it because it is westerly.\nThe Triplicity of Taurus is for the opposite of this section, which is the South-East; its first governing ruler is the planet Venus because it is southerly, then Saturn follows it because it is easterly.\nThe Triplicity of Gemini is for the North-East; the owner of its first governance is Saturn because it is easterly, and Jupiter follows it because it is northerly.\nThe Triplicity of Cancer is for what opposes this section, which is the South-West; its first governing ruler is Mars because it is westerly, then Venus follows it because it is southerly.\n\nHe said: Since these things were so, and the position of its habitation was divided into four quarters equal in number to the Triplicities:\nAs for its latitude, it is divided by the line passing through our sea - meaning the Sea of Alexandria - starting from the place called the Strait of Hercules and taking to the gulf called Issicus, which is at the mountain ridge following it from the east.

Therefore, their inhabitants became people of politics, doing good deeds, and consolation.\nAs for the lands of Tyrrhenia, Celtica, and Spain among them, they conform to Sagittarius and Jupiter.

Therefore, the people of these lands became more fluctuating in trade than others, people of transactions, people of cunning and deceit, disdainful of wealth due to the generosity in them. With them is weightiness of intellect, intelligence, and management in taking and giving. They love themselves. They are generally two-faced and double-tongued because of their conformity to these planets.

Abu Muhammad said: The proof of that is the request of the Children of Israel to Moses, peace be upon him, that Allah show Himself to them openly, and that He make for them a god they worship when they saw the idolaters in much of this.\nPtolemy said: They are deceitful, possessing lightness and recklessness with bravery in them, and they are people of wealth and richness.\nAs for whoever is in the lands of Phoenicia - meaning Yemen -, the lands of Palmyra, and the people of the deserts - meaning Mahra -, they conform to Leo and the Sun. Therefore, they became of sound chests, merciful hearts, lovers of the science of stars, venerating the sun especially among all the stars and prostrating to it.\nAs for those in the land of Najd and Hejaz and their Tihamas, they conform to Sagittarius and Jupiter. Their people therefore have good morals, beautiful appearance, easy living - meaning they suffice with the milk of their livestock -, and they have penetration in trade, taking, and giving, and suitability for beautiful doctrines, high matters, and leaderships. Their land is fertile, with many spices. Ptolemy only called it the land of the Bedouins because most Arabs are nomads. He called it fertile because it is the land most abundant in pasture without farms. Therefore, its people relied on grazing livestock and protected it with horses as there are no fortresses for them. He means that it has many spices with the flowers of the sands like chamomile, lavender, and others. Yemen gathers roses and many spices. Most of the herbs mentioned by Dioscorides in his book known as the Book of Herbs are not lacking in it, along with precious gems. It is devoid of width except at its coast in what approximates the weight of a mithqal and exceeds it. In it are places where ambergris is cast on its shores. Mahra and Banu Majid on the two coasts of the Sea of Yemen, east and west, have ambergris camels. That is because their grazing is on the coast. If the camel smells the ambergris, it kneels and does not rise until its owner misses it, seeks it, finds it near it, and picks it up. If he is slow to it, it does not leave until its strength weakens from passion; perhaps it dies, so that is out of fear for it.",

They venerate Jupiter. What they have of the two ancient gems is abundant. They are people of cleanliness in food and drink, wise men looking into divine matters. Their morals are morals of justice, free men, and their souls are noble and strong. They hate evil, detest gossip and slander. Their affection is true; it is easy for them to sacrifice themselves to death for their relatives and whoever asks their help in good, praiseworthy matters. They are moderate in intercourse with women, people of chastity and purity. They wear high-priced clothing and give gifts. Their ambitions are high. They have cunning, deceit, and depth in opinion and consideration. That is because of the partnership of Jupiter and Saturn in the easterliness.\nGemini and Mercury are singled out from this domain with Jurjan, Tabaristan, Armenia, and what borders it. So the people of these places became faster in movement, more inclined to malice; their conduct improved, their good appeared, their stratagems increased, their deceit became subtle, and their secrets were concealed due to the lightness of Mercury's movement and the length of its disappearance.\nLibra and Venus are singled out with the land of Balkh, the land of Shash, and what borders it.

They are lovers of weapons, cutting off the right breasts because of their need to go out in armies.

The Moon dominated the West due to its suitability to its nature, so the nature of Venus and Mars flourished in it, manifesting godliness, burial of the dead, keeping of secrets, concealing of many things, revelation, prophethood, books, revelation, boundaries, and ownership. Mars affects some of it to others according to its increase towards its fullness and its decrease towards its concealment.

Abu Muhammad said: As for the mention of the natures of the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, it has entered into the mention of the natures of the whole. There remains the mention of the dwellings of this Peninsula, its paths, its waters, its mountains, its pastures, its valleys, and the attribution of every place in it to its inhabitants and its owner, in a manner of brevity. And into how many parts is this Peninsula divided regarding municipal parts, administrative divisions, Sultanic regions, open land sides, and Bedouin domains. So that whoever looks into this book is as if he were in the place of Dhul-Qarnayn, the surveyor of the earth, and Tamim al-Dari, the traveler of its populated parts, and the expert guide of its night-conversers, and the overseer of its farthest and nearest parts, so that he may know the vastness of the land of his Lord, the multitude of His creation, and the abundance of His provision. There is no god but Allah, the Mighty, the Wise. Chapter: What was reported from Ibn Abbas, may Allah have mercy on him, regarding the mention of the Arabian Peninsula. As for the hadith of Abdullah ibn Abbas regarding the Arabian Peninsula, it is what was transmitted to us from Muhammad ibn al-Sa'ib al-Kalbi from Abu Salih from Ibn Abbas from a source, and from Muawiyah ibn Umayrah ibn Makhaws al-Kindi, that he heard Abdullah ibn Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib when a man asked him about the children of Nizar ibn Ma'add. He said: They are four: Mudar, Rabi'a, Iyad, and Anmar. The children of Ma'add ibn Adnan ibn Udad multiplied, grew, and followed one another. Their dwellings were Mecca [Mecca, Saudi Arabia] and what adjoined it of Tihama. They spread into the lands adjacent to them and competed for dwellings and places. The land of the Arabs on that day was empty, and there was hardly anyone in its Tihama, its Najd, its Hijaz, and its Arud, because Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed its signs and exiled its people, except for those of them who had fortified themselves in the peaks of mountains and their ravines and joined places where no one could reach them, avoiding the paths of his soldiers and the tracks of his horses, fleeing to them from them. So they divided the Ghaur (lowland)—the Ghaur of Tihama—among themselves into seven divisions. For each division was what adjoined it of the highlands of Hijaz, Najd, and the Tihamas of Yemen for their dwellings, their roamings, and the grazing grounds of their livestock and cattle. The land of the Arabs entirely on that day...",

It is narrated as 'Mutiqa' from 'Tawq' (collar), which is what encircles the neck of silver collars and the like—and it is the Peninsula of the Arabs (Jazirat al-Arab) which became the portion of those whom Allah, Blessed and Exalted, made speak the Arabic tongue when the tongues were confused at Babylon [Babylon, Iraq] in the time of Nimrod son of Cush son of Canaan son of Ham son of Noah, on the day Peleg son of Eber son of Shelah son of Arphaxad son of Shem son of Noah divided the earth among the children of Noah, peace be upon him: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The lands of the Arabs were only named 'Al-Jazira' (The Island) because of the surrounding of seas and rivers around it from its corners and edges. They became in it like an island among the islands of the sea. That is because the Euphrates [Euphrates River], returning from the land of the Romans [Byzantine Empire], appears in the region of Qinnasrin [Qinnasrin, Syria], then descends upon Al-Jazira [Upper Mesopotamia] and the Sawad of Iraq [Southern Iraq], until it pours into the sea from the side of Basra [Basra, Iraq] and Al-Ubulla [Al-Ubulla, Iraq] and extends to Abadan [Abadan, Iran]. The sea takes from that place heading west, bending around the land of the Arabs, coming upon Safwan [Safwan, Iraq], Kazima [Kazima, Kuwait], and reaching Qatif [Qatif, Saudi Arabia], Hajar [Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia], the coasts (Asyaf) of Bahrain [Bahrain], Qatar [Qatar], Oman [Oman], and Al-Shihr [Ash Shihr, Yemen]. A neck from it inclines to Hadhramaut [Hadhramaut, Yemen] and the region of Abyan and Aden [Aden, Yemen] and Dahlak [Dahlak Archipelago, Eritrea]. That neck elongates and thrusts into the Tihamas of Yemen, the lands of Farasan [Farasan Islands, Saudi Arabia], Hakam, the Ash'aris, and Akk, and proceeds to Jeddah [Jeddah, Saudi Arabia], the coast of Mecca, and Al-Jar [Al-Jar, Saudi Arabia], the coast of Medina, and the coast of Al-Tur [Tor, Egypt] and the Gulf of Ayla [Gulf of Aqaba], and the coast of Raya—a district of the maritime districts of Egypt—until it reaches the Qulzum of Egypt [Suez, Egypt] and mixes with its lands. The Nile [Nile River] approaches from the west of this neck from the upper lands of the Sudan, extending parallel to the sea with it, until it pours into the sea of Egypt and the Levant (Sham) [Mediterranean Sea]. Then that sea approaches from Egypt until it reaches the land of Palestine [Palestine], passing by Ashkelon [Ashkelon, Israel] and its coasts, and coming upon Tyre [Tyre, Lebanon], the coast of Jordan, and upon Beirut [Beirut, Lebanon] and those associated with it from the coasts of Damascus. Then it penetrates to the coasts of Homs [Homs, Syria] and the coasts of Qinnasrin, until it mixes with the region from which the Euphrates approached, descending upon the edges of Qinnasrin and Al-Jazira to the Sawad of Iraq. So the land of the Arabs became, from this Peninsula in which they settled and circulated, in five divisions according to the Arabs and in their poetry: Tihama, Hijaz, Najd, Al-Arud...",

    "text": "...and Yemen. That is because the Sarat Mountain [Sarawat Mountains], which is the greatest and most mentioned mountain of the Arabs, approached from the depth of Yemen until it reached the edges of the deserts of Sham (The Levant). The Arabs named it Hijaz because it formed a barrier (hajaza) between the Ghaur (Lowland), which is descending, and Najd (Highland), which is rising. So whatever was behind that mountain to its west towards the coasts of the sea, from the lands of the Ash'aris, Akk, Hakam, Kinana, and others, and below them to Dhat Irq and Al-Juhfa and what adjoined it, and what sank of its land, is the Ghaur—the Ghaur of Tihama—and Tihama encompasses all of that. And whatever was on this side of that mountain to its east, from the deserts of Najd to the edges of Iraq and Al-Samawa and what follows it, became Najd; and Najd encompasses all of that. The mountain itself is its Sarat (Back/Ridge), and it is the Hijaz. In a narration, it is Al-Jarr, and Al-Jarr is the foot of the mountain. Qays ibn al-Khatim said: 'Ask the man Abdullah at Al-Jarr, did he see... Our battalions in war, how was their fighting?' Whatever was retained to its east by the mountains and descended to the region of Fayd [Fayd, Saudi Arabia] and the two mountains of Tayy to Medina [Medina, Saudi Arabia] and returning to the land of Madhhij from Tathlith [Tathlith, Saudi Arabia] and what is below it to the region of Fayd, is Hijaz. The Arabs call it Najd, Jals, and Hijaz, and Hijaz encompasses all of that. The lands of Al-Yamama [Al-Yamama/Riyadh region] and Bahrain [Bahrain/Eastern Arabia] and what adjoins them became Al-Arud (The Obstructing/Breadth); it contains Najd and Ghaur due to its proximity to the seas and the depression of places within it, and the flow of valleys in it; Al-Arud encompasses all of that. Whatever was behind Tathlith and what neared it to Sana'a [Sana'a, Yemen] and what adjoined it to Hadhramaut [Hadhramaut, Yemen], Al-Shihr [Ash Shihr, Yemen], Oman [Oman], and what follows it became Yemen; it contains Tihamas and Najd, and Yemen encompasses all of that. Abu Muhammad said: What supports this regarding all of Yemen for these places are the letters of appointments from the Caliphs to the governors of Sana'a, Yemen and its provinces (Mikhlaws), Akk, Oman, and Hadhramaut—meaning by Akk the land of Tihama. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib used to say: When Allah, Blessed and Exalted, created the earth, it swayed with its inhabitants, so He struck it with this mountain, meaning Al-Sarat. Its beginning is from Yemen until it reached Sham (The Levant), and the valleys cut through it until it ended at Nakhla. From it were Hys and Yasum, and they are called the Yasumayn, just as the sun and moon are called Al-Qamaran, and Abu Bakr and Umar are called Al-Umaran. The poet of Rajaz said:",

Then the mountains appeared after it, and among them were Al-Abyad, the mountain of Al-Arj, Quds, Arah, Al-Ash'ar, and Al-Ajrad. These are the mountains between Mecca and Medina on the right of one going out from Mecca to Medina and the left of one returning to Mecca. The Arabs have mentioned Hijaz, Jals, Tihama, and Najd in many poems, and all of that confirms what we have described. Amr Barraq al-Thumali from Azd said: 'He frequented Tihama then became a dweller of Jals (Highland)... In peaks between Al-Shatt and Al-Tubaq.' He is sometimes called Ibn Barraqa, but he is Amr ibn Barraqa from Hamdan, then from Nahm, and he was a brave poet. He is the one who said in his Mym-rhyme poem: 'And if a people were my raid target, I raided them... So am I, in this, O people of Hamdan, an oppressor? Whenever a sharp heart, a sword... and a proud nose come together, injustices avoid you.' Layla bint al-Harith al-Kinaniyah said: 'Did Thumalah prevent what is near it... Then a Ghaur (Lowland) afterwards or a Jals (Highland), Thumala?' Umayyah ibn Abi 'A'idh al-Hudhali said: 'Hudhayl protected the heart of Hijaz, and indeed... The Hijaz of Hudhayl overtops people from above.' Labid ibn Rabi'a ibn Malik ibn Ja'far ibn Kilab said: 'Murriyah settled in Fayd and neighbored... The people of Hijaz, so where from you is her destination?' Hubayra ibn Amr ibn Jurthuma al-Nahdi said: 'And Kinda raves with threats, and Madhhij... And Shahran are from the people of Hijaz and Wahib.' Shahran is in the Sarat of Bisha [Bisha, Saudi Arabia], Turabah, and Tabalah, between Jurash and the beginning of the Sarat of Azd.

And regarding Shurayh ibn al-Ahwas: 'I honor you in Hijaz, and if you go far... You find me among the mightiest of the people of Najd.' Tarafa ibn al-Abd said, mentioning the killing of Amr ibn Mamah on the day of Qadib: 'But a band from Qays Aylan called out... Driving the Barabir in the land of Hijaz.' The Barabir here are sheep. It is also narrated: 'Driving the Barair in the upper Hijaz', and Barair here is the plural of Barir, which is the fruit of the Arak tree. 'And he sniffed Barair in the upper...

Dhat Irq is the separation between Tihama, Najd, and Hijaz. In it, the poet says: 'It is as if the riding camels did not kneel at Tihama... When their chests ascended from Dhat Irq.' Another from the people of Dhat Irq said: 'And we are in a high plain, not of Najd... Nor of Tihama, so the eye chokes with tears.' Knowledge of the detail of this Peninsula according to the people of Yemen: It is, according to the people of Yemen, Yemen and Sham (North). Its south is Yemen and its north is Sham, Najd, and Tihama. So Al-Najd is what rose from it from the Sarat and appeared from its peaks going towards the East in a level plain below what descends to Al-Arud. And Hijaz is what formed a barrier between Yemen and Sham. And Sarat is what became consistent and elongated in the earth from the mountains of this Peninsula, likened to the back (Sarat) of leather.

And Al-Shihr is taken from the 'Shihr' of the earth, which is the saltiness of the earth and the growing places of saline plants. We will detail the description of every section of these lands unique in their names. Whatever of them is a narrow land whose contents we can encompass, like Al-Arud and Najran, [we will describe fully]. And whatever is a vast land whose smallest parts exceed the largest of Al-Arud, we will describe with a general, traversing description, and we cannot do otherwise due to the vastness of the lands and the multitude of dwellings. Description of Yemen the Green: It was named 'Yemen the Green' due to the abundance of its trees, fruits, and crops. The sea surrounds it from the East to the South, then returning to the West. A line separates it from the rest of the Arabian Peninsula, taking from the borders of Oman [Oman] and Yabrin [Yabrin, Saudi Arabia] to the border of what is between Yemen and Al-Yamama, then to the borders of Al-Hajirah, Tathlith [Tathlith, Saudi Arabia], the rivers of Jurash [Jurash, Saudi Arabia], and Katnah, descending in the Sarat upon the peaks of Anz, to Tihama upon Umm Jahdam, to the sea opposite a mountain called Kadummul, near Hamdah. That is the border between the land of Kinana and Yemen from the belly of Tihama. The first surrounding of the sea around Yemen is from the side of Dama, then Tanwa, then Al-Jamjah, then Ras al-Fartak [Ras Fartak, Yemen], then the edges of the mountains of Al-Yahmad and what fell and led from them to the region of Al-Shihr [Ash Shihr, Yemen], then Al-Shihr, then Ghubb al-Khays, then Ghubb al-Ghayth—a clan of Mahra—then Ghubb al-Qamar [Bay of al-Qamar] (spelled like Qamar/Moon of the sky), then Ghubb al-Aqar—a clan of Mahra—then Al-Khayraj, then Al-As'aa. In the middle of this coast eastward between Oman and Aden is Raysut [Raysut/Salalah, Oman]. It is a refuge like a citadel, rather a citadel built as a structure on a mountain. The sea surrounds it except from one side, which is the land. Whoever wants Aden, his path is upon it; if he wants to enter, he enters, and if he wants, he passes the path and does not turn to it. Between the path that branches to it and the path traveled to Oman is the amount of a mile. In it resided people of Azd from Banu Jadid. People from Al-Qamar in our early time attacked those in it by night and killed them. Among those killed in it was a man called Amr ibn Yusuf al-jadidi, one of its leaders, an Azdi. Those who scrutinized that from Al-Qamar were Banu Khanzarit, and they expelled whoever remained of its people from it. So they dispersed to the lands of Al-Ghayth...",

When they entered the citadel with the help of the Thaghra, Banu Khanzarit feared and went out to the lands. Their leader Muhammad ibn Khalid went out with a group of Banu Khanzarit until they entered a place called Rada' (with a damma on the R), whose inhabitants are Banu Riyam, a clan of Al-Qamar, and they neighbored them. Banu Riyam have a great fortress in Oman that cannot be sought (impregnable). It is said that the ancient inhabitants of Raysut were the Bayasira, and Jadid from Azd descended upon them and became leaders among them. Then people from Arab tribes other than Mahra exhausted it with Jadid, and they sometimes intermarry with Mahra. The leader of those in it after that was Musa ibn Rabi' from Al-Adas. Then the sea turns upon Yemen westward and northward from Aden, passing by the coast of Lahj [Lahj, Yemen] and Abyan [Abyan, Yemen], and the dune of Yaramis—which is a Ribat (frontier post)—and the coasts of Banu Majid from Al-Mandab [Bab el-Mandeb], then the coast of Al-Umayrah, then Al-arah, then to Ghalafiqa, the coast of Zabid [Zabid, Yemen], then Kamaran [Kamaran Island], then Atinah, then Al-Hardah, to Munfahiq Jabir, which is a headland (cape) with abundant, sharp winds, to Al-Sharjah, the coast of the land of Hakam, then the courtyard of Jazan [Jazan, Saudi Arabia], then Athr, then Ras Athr, which has many waves, to the coast of Hamdah. This is what surrounds Yemen from the sea. Mention of the islands of the sea: As for what neighbors the coasts of Yemen from the islands in the surrounding sea, there is Dahlak [Dahlak Archipelago, Eritrea]. And Kamaran, which is a fortress for whoever rules the Tihama of Yemen. Then the islands of Farasan [Farasan Islands, Saudi Arabia]. Then the island of Zeila [Zeila, Somalia], in which is a market to which goats are brought from the land of Abyssinia [Ethiopia]; their hides are bought, and most of their skinned carcasses are thrown into the sea. And the island of Berbera [Berbera, Somalia], which cuts across from the border of the coasts of Yemen, adjoining Aden in the sea from the direction of the rising of Canopus (Suhayl) to what is east of it. What is close to it is Aden, and facing it is Jabal al-Dukhan. And the island of Socotra [Socotra, Yemen], to which Socotran Aloe is attributed. It is the island of Berbera which cuts between Aden and the land of the Zanj [East Africa], fixed on the bearing. If one going out from Aden to the land of the Zanj takes [the route] as if he wants Oman, the island of Socotra goes along with him on his right until it ends, then he turns with it from the side of the Sea of the Zanj.

In it are many palm trees, and Ambergris falls to it. In it is Dragon's Blood (Dam al-Akhawayn), which is Al-Ayda', and much Aloe. As for the people of Aden, they say that no one from the Romans entered it, but its people were the monks (Al-Rahabinah), then they perished, and Mahra and a people from the Shurat (Kharijites) inhabited it. The call of Islam appeared in it, then the Shurat increased in it and attacked those Muslims who were in it and killed them except for ten souls. In it is a mosque at a place called Al-Suq. The Tihami Cities of Yemen: Aden [Aden, Yemen] is southern Tihami; it is the oldest market of the Arabs. It is a coast surrounded by a mountain which had no path, so a gate was cut in the mountain with iron picks, and it got a path to the land and a pass. Its water source is water called Al-Hayq, aquifers in sand on the side of the desert of Iram. In it (the city) itself are wells of salty and brackish water. The Maribiyyun and Hamahimiyyun and Malahiyyun inhabited it; the Maribiyyun say they are from the children of Aaron. Among the people of Aden are Ibn Munadhir the poet and Ibn Abi Umar the Hadith scholar. And Lahj [Lahj, Yemen]: in it are the Asabih, and they are the children of Asbah ibn Amr ibn Harith Dhu Asbah ibn Malik ibn Zayd ibn Al-Ghawth ibn Sa'd ibn Awf ibn Adi ibn Malik ibn Zayd ibn Sadad ibn Zur'ah, who is Himyar the Younger.

And Farasan: a tribe from Taghlib, and they were anciently Christians and have churches in the islands of Al-Farasan [Farasan Islands] which have fallen into ruin. There is martial valor in them; Banu Majid sometimes fight them. They conduct trade to the land of Abyssinia [Ethiopia] and have one voyage in the year, and many people join them. The genealogists of Himyar say they are from Himyar. And Al-Hasib, which is the village of Zabid [Zabid, Yemen]; it belongs to the Ash'aris. Lately, Banu Waqid from Thaqif mixed with them.

Then Al-Mahjam [Al-Mahjam, Yemen], which is the city of Surdud. Most of its deserts and its people of might are Khawlan from its upper and lower parts, and its northern parts belong to Akk. And Mawr [Mawr, Yemen], and in it is a city called Balahah belonging to Akk; Mawr is one of the great watering places of Yemen. Then Al-Sa'id from the land of Hakam, a village belonging to Hakam. And Al-Saqiftan, a village belonging to Hakam on the Wadi Khulab; in it and in Al-Sa'id are the Ashraf of Hakam, Banu Abd al-Jadd. Then Al-Hajar, the village of Damad and Jazan [Jazan, Saudi Arabia]. In the land of Hakam are many villages called Al-Makharif and Sabya [Sabya, Saudi Arabia]. Then Baysh [Baysh, Saudi Arabia], and in it are clients (Mawali) of Quraysh. Its coast is Athr, and it is a market of great importance. The Arabs make it heavy (emphasize it) so they say 'Aththar'. To the volcanic field (Harrah) of Athr are attributed the lions called 'Lions of Athr' and 'Lions of Atud'. It is a village of its deserts, mentioned by Ibn Muqbil who said: 'Their sitting in it is like the lean high-nosed ones (lions)... As if they are lions in Turj or lions in Atud.' And Umm Jahdam is a village between Kinana and Azd, and it is the border of Yemen. The Najdi Cities of Yemen and what resembles Najd: The first of the cities of Yemen on the bearing of its Najd is Al-Janad [Al-Janad, Yemen] from the land of the Sakasik. Its mosque is counted among the noble mosques; Mu'adh ibn Jabal planned it. There is always adjacent dwelling (Mujawara) in it, and visitors come to it. All that we mentioned of the Tihami Yemeni villages are attributed in the registers of the Caliphs to the administration of Al-Janad. And Jaba [Jaba, Yemen], the city of Al-Ma'afir; it belongs to the family of Al-Karandi from Banu Thumamah back to Himyar the Younger. And Jayshan [Jayshan, Yemen], a city inhabited by a mixture of Himyar from Ru'ayni, Rada'i, Sarari, and others. Near it are villages having deserts attributed to them, like Hajr and Badr. And Al-Suhayb, inhabited by a people from Saba called Saba al-Suhayb. As for Badr, the Bahriyyun from Al-Sadaf inhabited it, and some of them inhabited Lahj with the Asabih.

Then Dhamar [Dhamar, Yemen], and its inhabitants are from Himyar, and in it are a group of the Abna (Persian descendants). Al-Dhamari the Hadith scholar is from there. In it, and in Al-Janad and Jayshan, there have always been scholars and jurists like Abu Qurrah, the owner of the Musnad, and Abd al-Rahman ibn Abdullah, the reciter of the Musnads. Then Rada' [Rada', Yemen], which is a city inhabited by a mixture of Himyar from the Aswadiyyin, Khawlan, Al-Jarib, and Ans. Surrounding it in its desert are the Rabi'iyyun, Ziyadiyyun, Balharith, and Banu Hubaysh from Zabid. From its people is Ahmad ibn Isa al-Khawlani, the author of the Urjuza of Hajj, which we have established at the end of the book. And Ibn Abi Muna the poet, a Persian from the Abna. Rada' is between the Najd of Himyar, upon which are the fortresses (Masani') of Ru'ayn, and the Najd of Madhhij, upon which are Radman and Qarn. In its south is the city of Hasi, Batra, and Al-Khaniq from the land of Al-Sarw. Then the city of Sana'a [Sana'a, Yemen], which is the Mother of Yemen and its Pole, because it is in the middle of it; what is between it and Aden is like what is between it and the border of Yemen from the land of Najd and Hijaz. Its name in the Jahiliyyah was Azal. The people of Sham (Levant) call it Al-Qasbah. The Arabs say: 'There must be [a journey to] Sana'a, even if the travel is long.' One attributed to Sana'a is called San'ani, like Bahra/Bahrani, because they saw the Nun as lighter than the Waw. Khawlan does not attribute to it except on the structure of the root: San'awi. They all say for a resident of Al-Kadra: Kadrawi, and do not say Kadrani. Sana'a is the oldest of the cities of the earth because Shem son of Noah founded it. I have collected its news in ancient times in the Book of Al-Iklil, and we have turned away from mentioning its ancient history in this place. There has always been in it a scholar, a jurist, a wise man, an ascetic, and one who loves Allah, Mighty and Majestic, with excessive love and fears Him with wakeful fear, in the manner mentioned by Ptolemy regarding the natures of the people of this region.

They have the San'ani broken script for Qurans and the beautification that cannot be matched. They have the truths of the form [grammar/vowels]; Al-Khalil mentioned them for that. They have conditions (Shurut/contracts) unlike others; no jurist from the people of the metropolises has a condition except that they have one more eloquent, sweeter in wording, more impactful in meaning, and closer in brevity. Among them are orators like Mutarrif ibn Mazin and Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Ya'fur (with Damma on the Ya and Kasra on the Fa). In it are scholars like Wahb ibn Munabbih and his two brothers Hammam and Ma'qal; Abd al-Razzaq, Abd al-Rahman ibn Dawud, Ibn al-Sharud, Hisham ibn Yusuf, and Mutarrif ibn Mazin, the inventor of the distribution of water channels (Ghayul). Among the astronomers: Dardan, Abu Ismah, Abu Jundah, Ibn Asim, Ibn al-Munaydhir, Ibn Abdullah, and others. Among the poets are the likes of Alqama Dhu Jadan, and Waddah al-Yaman, who came with his poetry to Al-Walid and was assassinated because of Umm al-Banin bint Bishr ibn Marwan. And Bakr ibn Mirdas; he was witty, dark-skinned (Adam), of good appearance and freshness. He had clothes numbering the days of his going out from his house in the year. It was part of the perfection of his chivalry that he would not go out of his house until he tied the straps of his sandals, so no one ever saw him with a broken strap on the road. His poetry was widely circulated. Ibn Mirza al-Abnawi informed me from someone who told him from the people of Sana'a, from his father, who said: 'I came to the Hajj and saw in the Tawaf a witty, light-spirited young man surrounded by a group. When he finished his Tawaf and prayer, I said: Who is this? It was said: Abu Nuwas al-Hasan ibn Hani. So I greeted him, conversed with him, and informed him of the popularity of his poems and news in Sana'a, and I asked him for some of it. He said: You seek me for the like of this while you have Bakr ibn Mirdas? I said: Is he of this status to you? He said: Is he not the one who says: \"O my brothers, indeed the doctor whom... you hope will cure me is my illness. He did not fail in advice, but he... is blind to the knowledge of what sickness I have. So ask him about his drugs... and ask him what I should abstain from. For...",

Except by smelling the beloved or embracing... and the sipping of saliva from mouth to mouth. O healer of the soul from its disease... cure my sickness and have mercy, show mercy. If with your eye when... night covers me and the eyes of the sleepers dose off. You circulate at your door weeping... for the heat of a sorrow kindled in the entrails. You would think I am a pilgrim in Ihram... in the courtyard of the House towards Zamzam. And your soul would be certain that love... is the strongest thing that clings to a Muslim. So free your slave from what ails him... and honor your face from being unjust.\"' Bakr also said on the tongue of two Bedouins who came to Yazid ibn al-Walid, the governor of Yemen, mentioning the beard: 'We lost our beards; how little is their benefit... and the oil is wasted on them, O Ibn Muti'. We oiled them and fluffed them for our Emir... like the two wing-feathers of a vulture falling to land. They drove no good other than length from them... and that they are a grief for every bedfellow. O would that we were beardless from them... hoping like the Bedouins every spring. So we would snatch wealth after which we would not be frightened... by fear of nakedness or fear of hunger.' Among the poets of Sana'a is Abu al-Samt al-Fayrouzi from the Abna, a wondrous poet. He came to Al-Mahdi praising him, and he accepted his praise. He praised the Barmakids, and they treated him according to the Persian custom and cut out for him properties in Sana'a and real estate from Al-Mahdi. We have established his elegy for his brother, which is among the best poetry, in the Book of Al-Iklil. Among the poets of Sana'a was Martal; he was a satirist of the Ashraf (nobles), entering into their honor. He did the like of that with Ya'fur ibn Abd al-Rahman, so he (Ya'fur) prepared someone to drink with him. When he drank one day with those drinking companions and got drunk, his mattress was carried on some beast holding him, and they traveled with him by night and arrived with him at Shibam [Shibam Kawkaban, Yemen] to Ya'fur. He woke up while he was in front of him. He said: 'How have you become, O Martal?' He said: 'In my Takht (container), O my master'—meaning the receptacle in which he was carried from his mattress. He laughed at him and conferred a favor upon him, then released him. But he (Martal) cut his tongue...",

    "text": "...with that favor from harming people, so he was not elevated. Among the poets of Sana'a, rather from its desert, is Abd al-Khaliq ibn Abi al-Talh al-Shihabi. He was naturally gifted, eloquent, and wondrous. We have established qasidas of his poetry in the first book of Al-Iklil along with the news of Banu Shihab. From the poets of Sana'a itself is Ibrahim ibn al-Jadawiyah; we have mentioned some of his poetry in the Book of Al-Iklil. He was naturally gifted in poetry and more skillful in Rajaz. He would sometimes resemble Al-Kumayt in some of his doctrine, as in his words regarding the Alawite Al-Nasir: 'Nasir al-Din (Helper of the Faith), you cease not to be victorious (Mansur)... May Allah thank your thanked endeavor.' He has an elegy for Abu al-Husayn al-Rassi, which is: 'The upper arm of Islam has weakened and its shoulder is broken... and calamities have assassinated a moon among the people.' Most of his poetry was consumed by satirizing the commoners and the lowlifes. Among his best poetry is his word regarding As'ad ibn Abi Ya'fur, the beginning of which is: 'O two birds, I think separation [is coming], so rise... Indeed, distance has decreed its desires, so fall.' There remained in it (Sana'a) scribes of the Diwan who were eloquent, not generating [artificial] speech nor hiding meanings, enslaving metaphors, such as Banu Abi Raja and others. Bishr ibn Abi Kubar al-Balawi was among the most eloquent of people. His eloquence was exchanged as gifts in the lands. He had an approach in it which no one preceded him to, and no one caught up with him in. His eloquence and its preciousness are admired, and that he is unique in it, and that the eloquent do not resemble his eloquence, and that he is unique in the beauty of quoting the Quran. We have established ten letters from it to indicate what is beyond them, and the least trace is a guide to the extent of the track-maker. Bishr wrote to Ibrahim ibn Abdullah al-Hajibi and to Sana'a for Harun al-Rashid—who had come to Sana'a in the year one hundred and eighty-two, stayed there a year and a month, then was dismissed—regarding the transgression of Hisham al-Abnawi against him. He (Harun) had resolved to appoint Bishr over some regions of Yemen, so Hisham ibn Yusuf reduced his income: 'As for after, if the Emir—may Allah give him enjoyment—sees fit not to inform Hisham of what he intends of my gift, for he has never intended good for me or my family, nor has he opened a door of a gift for me that would be pure from him...",

Then he adorned that with preaching, decorated it with advice, approached it with affection, incited him from the side of pity, and testified against him four testimonies by Allah that he is of the truthful, and the fifth that the wrath of Allah be upon him if he is of the liars. So behold, the chamberlain slips me with his sight, and behold, the scribe scalds me with his tongue, and behold, the servant turns his side away from me, and behold, the governor looks at me with the look of one fainting from death. So the faces of benefit became rejected, and the doors of hope blocked. The good that I used to hope for became like dry stubble scattered by the winds, and the gift which I had overlooked became a slippery slope whose water became deep, so I cannot seek it. So I ask Him who made for every Prophet an enemy from the criminals to suffice me against his evil and turn away his plot from me, for he sees me, he and his tribe, from where I do not see them. Peace.' And from him to Yazid ibn Mansur—the governor of Abu Ja'far al-Mansur over Yemen, who came to Sana'a in the beginning of the year one hundred and fifty-four and stayed there for the remainder of Al-Mansur's caliphate and a year of Al-Mahdi's caliphate, and his arrival was after Al-Furat ibn Salim: 'As for after, a letter came to me from the Emir—may Allah preserve him—with his messenger Nu'man al-Hamdani, ordering me to send to him the imposition (Farad) of Al-Furat ibn Salim—meaning by the imposition something he had imposed on the people of Yemen. And I inform the Emir—may Allah honor him—that before his letter, the Book of Allah the Exalted came to us with His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordering us in it to scatter what Al-Furat gathered and to demolish what he built, and to befriend whoever he opposed and oppose whoever he befriended. I looked into the two messages and compared the two messengers without bias of an accident or suspicion, praise be to Allah, that I entered.

So let the Emir—may Allah preserve him—decree what he is decreeing, then let him hasten that and not give me respite. For by Allah, indeed well-being is in His punishment, and punishment is in his well-being, and death is better than life with him, if this seriousness is from him and the truth is with him. Peace.' Also by Bishr: 'As for after, indeed among people is he whose bearing of his need is easier than the obscenity of his request. And among them is he whose bearing of his enmity is lighter than the weight of his friendship. And among them is he whose excessive blame is better than the extent of his praise. Indeed, Allah created So-and-so to distress the world and make its people filthy by him. He, despite his filth in it, is one of Allah's proofs against its people. So I ask Him who tested the earth with his life and distressed its people with his survival to give its belly a turn over its back (bury him). Peace.' And from Bishr to Al-Shafi'i regarding Abdullah ibn Mus'ab: 'As for after, you ask me about Abdullah as if you intended him (to visit) since arriving to him pleased you. Do not do so, may Allah have mercy on you. For greed for what he has does not cross the heart except from poor trust in Allah, Mighty and Majestic. And hoping for what is in his hand only occurs after despairing of the mercy of Allah, because he sees the moderation which Allah forbade as the extravagance for which Allah punishes. [He believes] that charity is abrogated, that hospitality is lifted, and that preferring a person over oneself during poverty is one of the major sins necessitating destruction. As if he had not heard of kindness (Ma'ruf) except in the First Jahiliyyah, whose remnants Allah cut off and forbade the Muslims from following their traces. As if the Tremor did not strike the people of Midian, in his view, except for a generosity that was among them; and the barren wind did not destroy Ad except for an expansion mentioned among them. He fears punishment for spending and hopes for reward for stinginess. He promises himself poverty and orders it to miserliness, for fear that some of the calamities of the oppressors might descend upon him, and what struck the criminal people might strike him. So stay, may Allah have mercy on you, in your place, be patient with your difficulty, and await the turns of fortune for him. Perhaps Allah will exchange for us and you one better than him in purity and closer in mercy. Peace.' And from him to Bashar ibn Rudabah: 'As for after, I saw you in the beginning of your time setting out early...'",

So whom have you left over your family, or on whom do you rely in the horror of your travel, or in whom do you trust in the state of your exile? Is it Allah or against Him? And how so, when I do not fear for you except from Him, for He has excused you and warned you, but you disobeyed His command and obeyed His enemies, and you went out angry thinking that He would never have power over you? So fear for yourself the slip, and dismount from your beast at every mountain. And when you and those with you are settled on their backs, do not say: 'Glory be to Him who has subjected this to us', because Allah, Blessed and Exalted, dislikes to be praised for what He has forbidden, but say: 'Our Lord, whoever prepared this for us, add to him a double punishment in the Fire.' Peace. And from him to Al-Hajibi: 'As for after, indeed Allah—and to Him is praise—had presented to me many directions and gave me choice in lawful gains, and I had, by the success of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and His benevolence, chosen from them the side of the Emir—may Allah the Exalted preserve him—and I was satisfied with him from every quest, and I limited myself to hoping in him from every gain. So Allah, Mighty and Majestic, rewarded him for that with a near victory and many spoils which He hastened; and Allah is Mighty, Wise. The Emir—may Allah the Exalted preserve him—has known the length of my affection for him and the antiquity of my sanctity, and that I am of those who spent before the victory and fought. Then I did not return to Bedouin life after emigration (Hijra), nor did I become a hypocrite after support (Nusra), nor was I like Hatib when he cast affection, nor like Tamim on the day they called out from behind the chambers. Rather, I remained in my place and was patient with my hardship until the victory came from Allah and the Emir—may Allah preserve him—appeared. When he prevailed and became established, and we hoped for wealth with him when he became rich and powerful, and complete might for the one who did good, he brought the parties (Ahzab) near and drew close those left behind from the Bedouins, and preferred with the spoils those who did not rush upon it with horse or camel. His favors became apparent upon those whose hearts are to be reconciled and those who used to criticize him regarding alms among them, and his benefits upon those who made excuses from the Bedouins who came after them became manifest in the horizons and in themselves. The leaders (Naqib) of Al-Aqaba, the poor of the Emigrants, and the destitute of Al-Suffa became such that their eyes overflow with sadness that they do not find...",

If the Emir—may Allah preserve him—sees fit to turn to us before the hearts of a group of us deviate, let him do so, for man was created anxious; when evil touches him, impatient, and when good touches him, withholding. I do not know what to excuse myself with today to the people regarding my affair with the Emir, while they know that I have seen in him two-thirds of my hope but have not reached in myself a quarter of my expectation. Or what does the Emir—may Allah preserve him—wait for regarding me after Allah gave him kingship, taught him wisdom, empowered him over the treasuries of the earth, and made him distinguished in the world, established in Islam, and obeyed and trusted by the Caliph—may Allah the Exalted keep him? So from whom should one flee to the Emir after this blessing, or who would excuse him with this dignity, and who would be satisfied from him with less than his restoration except one who makes a fool of himself? Peace.' And he wrote to Yahya ibn Khalid ibn Barmak seeking benefit through Al-Hajibi: 'As for after, may Allah preserve Abu Ali, and preserve for you what He entrusted you with of your religion, your trust, and the conclusions of your work. As for what you love to have knowledge of regarding the arrival of Al-Hajibi to us, and what he practiced among us, and the state the Muslims have come to be in with him before us, all of that—by the praise of Allah and His blessings—is according to your best joy, greatest hope, and utmost expectation, regarding the calmness of the populace, the safety of the roads, the goodness of the situation, and the succession of rains. The people have become, by the praise of Allah, merciful among themselves; nothing is heard but \"Peace, Peace.\" That is because Al-Hajibi, when he came to us, turned to the best of people and the people of righteousness among them, so he brought them near and drew them close. He was harsh against the people of immorality and suspicion, and he distanced them and pushed them away. He sent for the bearers of the Quran, and when they gathered to him from the ends of the lands, he selected the jurists and the people of opinion among them and made them his entourage and the people of his consultation. He sent many of them as workers over many of the regions of his work. He entrusted to them what the Commander of the Faithful entrusted to him regarding taking alms and Zakat in their proper ways and distributing the five shares fully among their people. He informed them that the Commander of the Faithful did not order him nor those before him from the governors of Yemen and others except with justice and benevolence, and that the Commander of the Faithful is innocent before Allah of the injustice of every oppressor and the tyranny of every tyrant, and that he has cast off what burdens his neck and placed it in the religion...",

At that, there remained no sect of the sects of Muslims, nor a group of the righteous, nor anyone of the poor and destitute, but that he prayed for the Commander of the Faithful for long life. Then they prayed for you, O Abu Ali, with the best of prayers, and spread about you the best of praise, for what Allah drove to them because of you and made it through the blessing of your support, and made it flow for them upon your tongue and hand, and for what Al-Hajibi undertook among them from behind you. For we have known him for gentleness without weakness, severity without violence, and seriousness not mixed with jest. Moreover, he is with that rarely negligent, strongly suspicious; he does not rely on his scribes nor delegate his affair to his trustees, nor feel at ease with his sitting companions until he inspects things himself. He brings what is present of them before his eyes and issues what is absent from him of them upon his knowledge. Attending to the great does not prevent him from demanding the small. He has mastered politics and is firmly rooted in management. The people most fearful of his anger are all most hopeful of his reward, and the least secure from his punishment are those who stick longest to his company. He has occupied everyone with himself so each attended to his affair; no one exceeds his limit nor transgresses his measure, nor speaks except in what concerns him. We do not see him, by the praise of Allah, increasing every day except in strength, nor do affairs increase with him except in precision. There is no way for a backbiter to reach him, nor greed for a detractor with him. Peace.' And from him to Al-Hajibi—who had forbidden him from exposing himself to the ministers and the people of Iraq: 'As for after, you wrote to me forbidding me from the Sultan and from his proximity. I do not apologize to you for that. If the Sultan calls me, I hasten; and if he is slow with me, I expose myself. If Allah, Blessed and Exalted, has made lawful for you the service of the Commander of the Faithful, the companionship of Al-Fadl, and the night-conversation of Ja'far, and permitted you to take from their wealth heaped talents of gold and silver, but forbade me from writing to the police, corresponding with the post, serving the eunuchs, and exposing myself to the wet-nurses, and prohibited for me from their wealth what I block the gap with and cover the nakedness with, then I am the destroyed one and you are the saved one. And if the matter is not so, and for every man of us is what he earned of sin, then you are the one who took charge of the greater part of it among them. And he struck a parable for us and forgot his creation. Peace.'",

And from him also to Ali ibn Sulayman—who had come to Yemen as its governor on behalf of Al-Mahdi in the year one hundred and sixty-two and stayed there for a year and a half—: 'As for after, when my mind became confused to me, my opinion became ambiguous to me, and I doubted regarding my affair, I did not doubt that Allah, Blessed and Exalted, when He wanted to decree my provision for me and to test me with hardship upon my family, He informed you of the essence of my greed, guided you to the direction of my request, and made you a companion to the people of my need. Then He tested me by requesting it from you. When I mentioned it, you shone and rejoiced, and promised from yourself a good promise. So I distributed my expenditure due to your shining, expanded upon my family due to your rejoicing, and borrowed from my brothers due to your promise. But when I came to you seeking fulfillment, you frowned and scowled, then turned away and acted arrogantly. The expenditure has been exhausted, hope has been cut off, and I have despaired of greed just as the disbelievers despair of the companions of the graves. The greatest distress to me and the severest hardship is that someone other than you offers me the need which I requested from you, and I dislike that it be except through your means and run except by your hand. By my life, that was only due to prior knowledge regarding my wretchedness with you. So I ask Allah, Mighty and Majestic, who made your status part of my tribulation, your good position part of my calamity, and the length of your life a trial for my family, to transfer you to His Paradise before your glance returns to you.

They do not increase except in hatred for you, nor in testimony against you except in certainty, due to their knowledge of you of old and their knowledge of your condition, small and large. By my life, if you are to this day as they claimed, you are then of the mockers.

Abu Muhammad said: Then after Sana'a, among the villages of Hamdan in its Najd is its town Raydah [Raydah, Yemen]. In it is the Suspended Well and the Lofty Palace, which is Talfum. Alqama ibn Dhi Jadan says about it: 'And that of La'wah, the famous one from the head of Talfum... Remove! And the lion was the protector of truths.' The La'wiyyun inhabit it. And Athafit... it is called Athafah with Ha, and with Ta more often. The chief Al-Kabbari from the people of Athafit told me, he said: It used to be called Durna in the Jahiliyyah, and it is the one Al-A'sha mentioned in his saying: 'I say to the drinkers in Durna when they got drunk... Smell! And how does the drunken drinker smell?' Al-A'sha often spent the autumn in it, and he had a wine press in it where he pressed what the people of Athafit gave him abundantly of their grapes. They narrate in his Ba-rhyme poem: 'I love Athafit at the time of harvest... and the time of the pressing of its grapes.' The family of Dhu Kibar and Wada'ah inhabit it. And Khaywan [Khaywan, Yemen]: the land of Khaywan ibn Malik, and it is among the best of the land of Hamdan, the most noble in soil, and the best in fruit. The Mu'idiyyun, Ridwaniyyun, Banu Nu'aym, the family of Abu 'Ashan, and the family of Abu Hajr from the Ashraf of Hashid inhabit it. It is the border between Bakil and Hashid. Mu'id, their ancestor, was with Ali, peace be upon him, so he angered him, and he spent the night biting the middle of his saddle until he destroyed it and joined Mu'awiyah. There has always been in it Najd (bravery/nobility), a knight, and a poet. Among their poets is Ibn Abi al-Balas, who is the one who said regarding Abu al-Husayn Yahya ibn al-Husayn al-Rassi in a Sin-rhyme word of his: 'If your sword on the day of Adam's prostration... had been drawn, Iblis would not have disobeyed.'

    "text": "...Sa'dah [Sa'dah, Yemen]. It used to be called Juma' in the Jahiliyyah. In ancient times, there was a lofty palace in it. A man from the people of Hijaz returned from some kings of the sea (coast) and passed by that palace while tired. He lay on his back and contemplated its height. When it impressed him, he said: 'Laqad Sa'adah, Laqad Sa'adah!' (It has gone high/He has climbed it!). So it was named Sa'dah from that day. Some scholars of Iraq said: The Sa'idi arrowheads are attributed to Sa'dah, but it is said 'Sa'adiyyah'; if a poet is forced, he says 'Sa'idiyyah' in place of 'Sa'adiyyah'. It is the administrative district (Kura) of the land of Khawlan and the place of tanning in the deep Jahiliyyah. That is because it is in the middle of the land of Qaraz (acacia leaves used for tanning), which surrounds it at a distance of two days. Its border from the south is Khaywan and the land of Wada'ah. From the north is Mahjarah at the head of Al-Mandaj from the land of Banu Hayf from Wada'ah also. From the east is the falls of Barat in the lowland (Gha'it). From the west is the mine of Al-Qafa'ah from the land of Al-Ajdud from Khawlan. Then there is no city after it from the Najd of Yemen. There were wars and days (battles) in it which we have mentioned in some of our books, and we mentioned who was in it from the poets of Khawlan. Likewise, Najran [Najran, Saudi Arabia] had days, wars, and poets from Balharith and Hamdan. Among its poets was Ibn al-Baylamani from the Abna. What falls in Yemen of the Sarat Mountain and its beginning is Yemen: As for the Sarat Mountain which connects what is between the farthest Yemen and Sham, it is not a single mountain, but rather connected mountains in a single array from the farthest Yemen to Sham, with a width of four days along the entire length of the Sarat; a fraction of a day may increase in some of these places and decrease similarly in some of them. The beginning of this Sarat is from the land of Yemen, the land of Al-Ma'afir, then Hayq of Banu Majid, then 'Arr of Aden, which is a mountain surrounded by the sea. It gathers the Mikhlaf of Dhubhan, Al-Ju'ah, Jaba, Sabir, Dhakhir, Bardad, Sahara, Al-Dabab, Al-Ushaysh, Rasyan, and Tabashi'ah. The descendants of the Ma'afiris, Ya'fur, Hamdan, Al-Sakasik, and Banu Waqid inhabit these places. And Wadi al-Milh, inhabited by Al-Ash'ar, and in...",

Then Wadi Nakhla; in it are bananas, Mudar (sugar cane?), henna, and all greens. Also to it, after the waters from Al-Mawkif reach it, reach the waters of the land of Habl, the land of Shar'ab, Talaq, the fortress of Juwalah where Ja'far ibn Ibrahim al-Munakhi was killed, and Jabal al-Sirah. All these are south of Wadi Nakhla. From its north are Jabal Damt, Hamim, Adhaq, Wadi Nazzal, Al-Rawahid, Al-Wazirah, Jabal al-Marir, and Al-Fuwwahah. Then Wadi al-Milh from the land of Al-Rakb and south of Nakhla meets it, so they pour into Hays and cross it to the sea. The origins of Al-Milh are from Al-Maj'ar and Al-Mi'ram from the mountain of the land of Shar'ab and Jabal al-Sirah from the north of the valley. To it from its south are Arasim from the land of Al-Rakb, Al-Harajiyyah, the mountains of Ma'bar, then Dabbas. Then it and Nakhla meet at Al-Qana from the heads of Hays, the dwelling of Abu Ja'far ibn al-Nimr. Then Wadi Zabid, and we have mentioned it. What is between the land of Banu Majid and Abyan of the valleys ending towards the South to the region of Aden: The first valley of them from the direction of the East is Wadi al-Raghghadah, a people from Himyar, then Jabal Sarar from the land of Al-Sakasik, then Jabal al-Hasha from the land of Al-Sakasik, then Ba'dan, Rayman, and Al-Shi'r from the land of Al-Kila', Sakhlan, Dalal, Maytam Tibn Maytam—which is Tibn of Ibn al-Ruwayyah, different from Tibn of Lahj—and Al-Thajjah from Jabal al-Ta'kar. The outlet of these waters is to Wadi al-Ahwad from Al-Sakasik. Al-Ahwad pours from its west, and Rawa from the fortresses of Al-Sakasik, and Jabal Humr from the fortresses of Al-Sakasik—which is different from Humr of Jabalan. Then it ends at Jabal al-Nusur, which is a border between Al-Sakasik and Al-Asni'ah from...",

Then these waters end in Wadi al-Sawadin from the east of Al-Janad. Then the bottoms (Qi'an) of Al-Ajnad pour into it; all of them are from Ajnad La'la'ah to Al-Farhiyyah from the section of Jabal Sabir from its east, Najd al-Sadari, Wadi al-Arafah, and Wadi al-Armah—which is the place of Banu Abi Kuhayl al-Saksaki—then the east of Jabal Sami', then the east of Jabal al-Silw, Jabal Abi al-Mughallis, and all the waters of Al-Dumluwah, the citadel of Ibn Abi al-Mughallis, which is ascended by two ladders. In the lower ladder of them are fourteen rungs, and the second above that has fourteen rungs. Between them is the trapdoor (Matbaq) and the guardhouse on the trapdoor between them. The top of the citadel is four hundred cubits by the same. In it are dwellings and houses, and in it is a tree called Al-Kalhamah which shades a hundred men; it is the most similar of trees to the Tamarind. In it is a congregational mosque with a pulpit. This citadel is a peak of Jabal al-Silw; its height and border from the side of the mountain from which it is separated is one hundred cubits on its south. From its east, from Khadir to the top of the citadel, is a journey of a sixth of a day, two hours. Likewise it is from its north facing Wadi al-Jannat and Suq al-Ju'ah. From its west, it is double what it is from its south in height. In it are the stables for the horses of its owner. His fortress in the mountain from which it is separated—I mean Al-Silw—is a bowshot away. Its watering place from which the people of the citadel drink at the lower ladder is a stream (Ghayl) with a pure, light, sweet cistern (Ma'jal), the like of which is not found; in it is their sufficiency. The gate of the citadel is in the north of the citadel. At the top of the citadel is a small pool. The waters of this citadel descend to Wadi al-Jannat from its north, then the source is north of Suq al-Ju'ah to Khadir. This Wadi al-Jannat resembles in description Wadi Dahr. It has many streams, cisterns, and watercourses. In it are grapes and wars mixed in its upper parts with all fruits. Its lower part gathers bananas, sugar cane, citron, cucumber, durra (sorghum), snake cucumber, coriander, and other things.

If he feared, he ascended Sabir to a citadel of his called Dhat al-Amm. This Al-Nubayrah has many grapes and fruits. These two valleys, Wadi al-Jannat and Wadi Warazan, meet with all of Khadir at a place called Karish. Then Wadi Haraz intercepts them; its origins are from the east of the mountains of Al-Silw, its north is Al-Rayyisah, and its south is Jabal al-Rama. These three valleys meet at a march of an hour from Karish. Then valleys of Al-Sakasik also meet these valleys from their east and north. From their north is Wadi Haqab and Wadi Dhaba. Wadi Dhaba is the valley of Abdullah ibn Ahmad al-Saksaki and Abdullah ibn Abi Tumah ibn Ahmad al-Saksaki; both are in the land of Al-Sakasik. It is a trampled valley that oozes; nothing is in it except durra. Its origins are Jarban, the fortress of Abdullah ibn Ahmad al-Saksaki, and Nadamah, a village at the base of the mountain north of the valley, which is its head. From its east is Jabal Humr, inhabited by the 'Awadir of Al-Sakasik. Wadi Dhaba belongs to the Akhadir of Al-Sakasik, and they are their leaders. And 'Uhamah, inhabited by the A'hum of Al-Sakasik east of the valley. And Wadi al-Dhawiyyah, which is the place of Musa ibn al-Harami, a Himyari. At the head of the valley is his small fortress. The origins of this valley are Jabal al-Hasha east of the valley, Manjal north of the valley, and Jabal Humr west of the valley. The meeting of all these valleys is at Jabal al-Nusur. Then it descends about two hours, and Wadi 'Alsan meets it. The origins of Wadi 'Alsan from its north are Jabal Haraz and Tha'ubah, from its west Jabal Asham and Wadi Sa'ah, and from its east the crossings of the Yemeni road from the highway of Aden to Al-Janad and others. These valleys meet in Lahj at a march of an hour from the village of Al-Juwar. Then this valley exits in Al-Juwar, then at Thara and Al-Junayb—both belonging to the Waqidis—then the middle of Al-Ra'ari', which is the market of the Waqidis and their city, then Fawr, which is the village of the Asabih.",

The fourth is Dathinah, and the fifth is Ahwar, and we have mentioned them both. Mountains of Al-Sakasik: Jabal al-Surdaf and Jabal al-Sudan from the back of Adim. Mountains of Al-Asha'ub: Al-Silw, gathering them, then after that Sami', Lahj, and other than Lahj, Mulh. Jabal Sabir belongs to the Hawashib. Mountains of Al-Rakb: Dhakhir, Shamir, Ma'bar, Al-Jadun, Dabbas, and Al-Marir. Mountains of Ja'dah: Among their great mountains is Jabal Harir (different from Haziz) and Jabal Radfan and Dar'ah. Among their fortresses below that are Shaka', Al-Aslam, and Humrah. Monuments of these places: The monument of Jabal al-Sirr, called Jabal al-Janah. One who hears this name thinks that this monument belongs to Shammar Dhu al-Janah, but it is not so. It is a great monument resembling Baynun in description. It is in Al-Ma'afir near Sahara to its east. Among them is the fortress (Masna'ah) of Wuhazah; its name is Shiba'. It resembles Na'it in palaces and carved stones.

The citadel has two roads; at the gate of each road is its water. The road of the citadel from its south has a cistern on it called Al-Wafit, hollowed in the black rock. Its depth in the ground is fifty cubits, its width twenty cubits, and the length fifty cubits, retained on its sides by a wall preventing falling into it. The second water is north of the fortress at the gate of the second fortress in a cavity of rock like a well, lined with pavement.

To it, the Arabs used to attribute Saluqi armors and Saluqi dogs. Among them is a mountain in the east of Wuhazah. At the top of the mountain is a mound of a demolished palace, a remnant of a male (structure?) which the Arabs liken to the Palace of Haraz. Gems and gold are still found in it. People raid it just as they raid the ruins of Al-Jawf. In this way (region) are noble mosques: the Mosque of Al-Janad, and the Mosque of Nahrah, which is at the top of Al-Shawafi north of the mountain next to the stone called the Mosque of the Living. And the Mosque of Mu'adh in Sayd. And the Mosque of Jabal San'an at the top of Jabal Alhan, famous for the whiteness on the night of every Friday; the Adhan is heard in it, and visitors are always in it from every place. And the Mosque of Shahir at the top of Jabal Milhan. Shahir is a peak at the top of Jabal Milhan; it is said that there are ninety-nine springs of water in it. It is a noble mosque. It is said: In the end of time, a sign of fire or something else must appear in it, and Allah knows best. Among them is the Seen, Forbidden Treasure between Jabal Jarabi and Jabal Milhan, opposite the bank of Al-Dabbah from Wadi Ayyan (not Ayan). It is next to the mountain of Al-Zahir known as Jabal al-Mudrab of Milhan. Many Arabs have traveled to it and intended it, but a dragon like a great rope intervenes between them and it, so they find no way to it.

It advances in Shawkan from the top of Wadi Najran, irrigating it and ending in the lowland (Al-Gha'it). Then valleys intercept between Najran and Tathlith, such as Habunan and others from the lands of Wadi'ah, the land of Yam, Zubayd Sanhan, and the land of Janb. We will mention the dwellings of these people later, Allah Almighty willing.\n\nThe Desert of Yemen and it is called Al-Gha'it (The Lowland):\nAs for the desert of Yemen and its lowland, it is Sayhad. It is a desert branching from Al-Dahna from the direction of Al-Yamama and Al-Falaj. The islands (Juzur) of Yemen overlook it from Masamat Banu Amir in the direction of Turabah, then Tathlith, between Tathlith and Dathinah. This desert separates between the islands of Yemen from the lower parts of these valleys and between Hadramawt by four or five stages between Najran and Bayhan. As for what is behind Najran to the north, it is more, because Sayhad approaches from two branches of Al-Dahna: one from the east of Al-Yamama and Yabrin, and the second from the west of Al-Yamama and what is between it and Mount Al-Hidhn. Then the east of the land of Banu Hilal and the east of the valleys of Najd: Tabalah, Turabah, and Bisha, until it issues from Al-Masamah. It is a desert with no water in it. Whoever wants Hadramawt from Najran and Al-Jawf - the Jawf of Hamdan - and Ma'rib, his exit is Al-'Abr, a watering place with wells. Whoever intends it from Bayhan, Al-Sarw, and Dathinah, his exit is from the land of Madhhij. Then valleys exit pouring from the land of Madhhij to Hadramawt until he reaches Dahr, which is the beginning of Hadramawt from that side. It belongs to Kindah and its inhabitants are Tujib. Then to Wadi Rakhyah, and in it are villages including Sama' and Sur Bani Harithah.",

This town was attributed to Hadramawt ibn Himyar the Younger, so the name of its inhabitant prevailed over it, as was said Khaywan and Najran. The meaning is the land of Hadramawt, the land of Khaywan, and the valley of Najran, because these are men to whom the places were attributed. Likewise, most of the lands of Himyar and Hamdan were named by the names of their settlers. Al-Sadaf were in Hadramawt from their day. Then Kindah returned to them after the killing of Ibn al-Jawn on the Day of Shi'b Jabalah when they departed from Al-Ghamr, the Ghamr of Dhi Kindah. In it are Al-Sadaf, Tujib, and Al-'Ibad from Kindah, Banu Mu'awiyah ibn Kindah, Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah, Banu Wahb, Banu Badda ibn al-Harith, Banu al-Ra'ish ibn al-Harith, Banu Amr ibn al-Harith, Banu Dhuhl ibn Mu'awiyah, and Banu al-Harith ibn Mu'awiyah. From Al-Sakun there is a group, and a group from Hamdan called Al-Mahatil from Dhi al-Jirab ibn Nashq, and they are with Kindah. And a group from Balharith ibn Ka'b in Raydat al-Say'ar, to which the Say'ari camels are attributed. About it Tarafa says:\nAnd at the foot of the mountain are signs as if their traces ... are a Yemeni garment embroidered by Raydah and Suhul.\nAl-Say'ar is a tribe from Al-Sadaf to which Raydah is attributed to distinguish between it and Raydat Ardayn.\n\nThe Land of Kindah from the Land of Hadramawt:\nIf one goes out from Al-'Abr, the first thing he meets is Darb al-'Ujayz al-Kindi.

Then Sawran, a moderate village belonging to Tujib of Kindah. Then Qashaqish, a village at the top of a mountain belonging to Tujib. Then 'Andal, a great city belonging to Al-Sadaf.

It is the dual form of Al-Hajar, and Al-Hajar is the village in the language of Himyar and the original Arabs. From it comes Hajar of Bahrain [Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia], Hajar of Najran [Najran, Saudi Arabia], Hajar of Jazan [Jazan, Saudi Arabia], and Hajar Hasbah of the Mikhlaf of Ma'dhin. The inhabitants of Khudun are Al-Sadaf, and the inhabitants of Dammun are Banu al-Harith the King ibn Amr al-Maqsur ibn Hujr Akil al-Murar. He was named Akil al-Murar only because some of Ghassan opposed him in some of his raids, sweeping away wealth belonging to him and capturing a slave girl of his. They went deep into the land with the slave girl, managing the wealth out of fear of the Tubba'. The slave girl began to turn around. She was asked: \"What is your turning around?\" She said: \"It is as if I see Hujr has come close to you, opening his mouth wide as if he were a camel that ate bitter herbs (Murar).\" He did not delay to catch up in that form, so he was named Akil al-Murar. The house of every man in these two villages overlooks his estate. They have a stream (Ghayl) pouring from the foot of the mountain which they drink. The crops of these villages are palm trees, and Al-'Abr is surrounded by them. Al-Dhabr is cultivation. From Al-Hajran palm against palm; palm trees and cultivation surround them. Al-Dhabr is cultivation. The land of Kindah is elevated as if it were Sarat. Its valleys pour into Hadramawt, then Hadramawt pours to the land of Mahra.

Then Hawrah, which is a great city belonging to Banu Harithah from Kindah. Then Qarat al-Ashba, which belongs to Kindah. Al-Qarah according to the Arabs is a hill, and its plural is Qar like Rahah and Rah, Sa'ah and Sa', and also Qur. Al-'Ajlaniyah is a large village opposite Haynan, except that Haynan is in Wadi al-'Abr - and its name is 'Ayn - and Al-'Ajlaniyah is in Wadi Daw'an. The land of Kindah is these two valleys; their upper parts are fortresses and their lower parts are crops and palm trees. Then Mansub, a valley containing villages, palm trees, crops, and cotton. Then Manub pours with 'Ayn and Daw'an between Shibam and Al-Qarah. Al-Qarah belongs to Hamdan, a great village with a fortress in its middle. As for Shibam [Shibam, Yemen], it is the city of everyone, the large one. Hadramawt inhabited it. It has thirty mosques, half of them ruined, destroyed by Kindah. It is the first land of Himyar.",

His grave is in the Red Sand Dune, then from it into an overlooking cave in the lower part of Wadi al-Ahqaf, which is a valley taking from the land of Mahra a journey of days.

One of its poets was Ibn Jubran, who is one of the poets of the Rafidah (Shi'a) and the author of the poem inciting against the Muslims. From Jayshan was the emergence of the Qarmatians in Yemen, and from Al-Janad. Mikhlaf Jayshan is inhabited by clans from Yarim Dhi Ru'ayn ibn Sahl ibn Zayd al-Jumhur. In it are the Sarariyyun, the Ra'diyyun, and the Raghamid, and its desert dwellers are Anjad. Counted from Mikhlaf Jayshan are Hajar, Badr, Sur, Hadar, Tharid, the land of Banu Habash, and the side of the land of Al-'Adw from Habb, Sakhlan, Al-'Ud, and Warakh.\nMikhlaf Rada' and That: The Mikhlaf of Rada' consists of the two villages Rada' and That, Al-'Urush, Bashran, Adhanah and its plain (Rahbah), and the land of Radman. Many names have entered into it which I adorned in the poem of Al-Rada'i at the end of the book. It and all its Mikhlifs are inhabited only by the clans of Madhhij and a few remnants of Himyar. In Rada' and That are the Aswadiyyun, the Rabi'iyyun, the Ziyadiyyun, and a mix of Arabs after that. Al-'Arsh and Hurriyah belong to Banu al-Harith ibn Ka'b, and they are the people of Kura' al-Qaryatayn. Their leaders are the family of Al-Dhamallaq, the family of Al-'Ayzar, and the family of Ilyas. Kuman is a wide land inhabited by Kuman, and they are from Zuwaf, Salamah, and Sanabih. Kuman connects to the land of Dhi Jurah, the land of Al-Hadd ibn Namirah ibn Madhhij. They and Kuman are among the best archers and sharpest of the Arabs. A predator hardly enters the land of Al-Hadd because they kill the predator with shooting.\nMikhlaf Ma'rib: The mountain belongs to Banu Malik from Murad, and to Banu Taliyah, Qa'ifah, and Fuja'ah. Its head is Mount Daqrar, which is one of the humped mountains. From it are Al-Suwayq and Tuhatim. From Adhanah is what is lower from Rahbah and Rahabah. There was a great palm grove there, and most of Sana'a's dates were from it. In it is a type called Al-Wansh. Then the Fitnah (strife) destroyed it. It used to be irrigated by the lower parts of Daqrar, then Al-Suwayq, then Habnun. These places are its slopes from the mountain in the south of Ma'rib. Its slopes in its north are to Nahj al-Jawf, Al-'Awahl, Haynan, Sirwah, and the valleys of Mawda'. Its east is the deep low ground (Al-Qa' al-Amaq) from Sayhad and Nahbiyah from Daghal to the Salt Mountain. It is not an upright mountain but a mountain in the ground",

As for Tabalah, Turj, and Bisha, they are among the valleys of Najd, and there are no lions in this, nor were there ever. Rather, the Arabs mean the Lions of Baysh, and they add the Ha to it, saying Bisha (with Fatha on Ba), which are the places of lions. Bisha Ba'tan is with Kasra on Ba. It was said: Rather, they meant Bisha of Najd, and that the heads of these valleys from the Upper Sarat, some descend to Najd and some descend to Tihama. What descends to Tihama has lions in it, and they have proximity. They attributed them to these valleys. Perhaps one of them ascended to the land of Najd, crossing from his land, and wreaked havoc there. So perhaps the first who attributed lions to these places saw one of them...",

The Hiriyah attributed to Al-Hirah [Al-Hirah, Iraq]. Bayt Ras is a place for wine in Jordan. Dwellings of those who went North (Tasha'ama) from the Arabs: As for the dwellings of Lakhm, they are scattered; most of them are between Ramla [Ramla, Israel/Palestine] and Egypt in Al-Jifar.

Banu Jara have the Islands of Banu Jara in the land of Egypt, which are white sands. As for Banu Ubayr, the clan of Hudbah ibn Khashram from Udhrah, their home is at Tall Qarsis and Al-Mahab. Some of Udhrah live in Jazirat al-Sawami' on white sands from the district (Kura) of Dayyan. Some of them are at Zankalum, and some in the Sa'id (Upper Egypt) of Egypt. From Banu al-Harith ibn Ka'b is a house living in Al-Faljah in the land of Damascus; among them is Abd al-Malik ibn al-Rahim al-Harithi. Dwellings of the Arabs beyond Medina: Between Medina and Wadi al-Qura [AlUla, Saudi Arabia] are five stages on the road of Al-Marwah. It has another road to the right of that in the land of Najd via the Fortress of Banu Uthman; its distance is four days. Khaybar [Khaybar, Saudi Arabia] has two roads to Medina: one is direct from Medina, and the second turns right from the Fortress of Banu Uthman. In Khaybar are a people of Jews, Mawali, and a mixture of Arabs. The dwellings of Banu Harb between these places are Juhaynah, Bali, and Muzaynah. These tribes anciently encroached on the land of Tayy below Banu Harb. From Al-Marwah to Medina is two stages: Al-Suwayda, where there is water, then Medina. Awal of Hijaz is to the right of Al-Suwayda. If the pilgrim of Egypt and Sham comes from Al-Suwayda to Medina, he turns to Awal, then they exit from it to Al-Sayyalah. In this Awal are the palms of Al-Marwah, inhabited by the Ja'afir, Mawali, and a mixture. Al-Is: Juhaynah and Muzaynah are in it. The abode of Juhaynah is separate from the borders of Radwa and Al-Ash'ar to a valley between Najd and the sea. Then from the end of the abode of Juhaynah is the abode of Bali to the border of the abode of Judham at Al-Nabk on the seashore, then Aynuna behind it.

As for what turns left towards the sea from the land of the Copts, it is Yemeni; in it are Bali, Lakhm, some of Qays, and mixtures of people. Then to Lakhm and those who mix with them from Kinana is what is around Ramla to Nablus [Nablus, Palestine]. They also have what passed Tabuk to Zoar (Zughar), which is a land of palms, and from it comes the Zughari dates. Then the Dead Lake [Dead Sea] into which Wadi Yarmouk and Jordan throw. Lakhm also has Golan and the lands following it: Nawa, Al-Bathaniyyah, and a portion of the land of Hauran. Juhaynah, Dhubyan, and some of Al-Qayn mix with them in these places. To the left of the mountains of Al-Shara are the cities of the people of Lot; among them is the stop Dhu Khashab and Al-Ghamr, which is Ghamrah. This region is finished. We return to classifying what remains of the dwellings of the Arabs east and north from Wadi al-Qura. From Wadi al-Qura to Khaybar to the east of Medina to the border of the Two Mountains (Aja and Salma) to what ends at the Harrah are the dwellings of Sulaym. No one mixes with them except a section of the Ansar who are travelers, and they may neighbor Tayy. As for the Najd between Mecca and Medina from Dhat Irq to the Two Mountains, then the Mine—the Mine of Sulaym [Mahd adh Dhahab, Saudi Arabia]—returning to Wadi al-Qura to Al-Hijr [Mada'in Saleh], the place of Thamud and the She-Camel, is one stage, and in it are great ruins. Between them is Al-Is, to which Al-Isi dates are attributed. Then from Al-Hijr to Tayma [Tayma, Saudi Arabia], the place of Al-Samaw'al in the Dahna, is three stages (Butan). Inhabiting what is between that from Tayy are Banu Sakhr and their brothers Banu Amr and a clan from Buhtur. The settlement of Tayma today belongs to Tayy, then to Banu Zurayq, Banu Mirdas, Banu Juwayn, and Al-Ghushah, who are Mawali. If you go out from Tayma intending Kufa [Kufa, Iraq] secondly, you are in the dwellings of Buhtur from Tayy until you fall into the dwellings of Banu Asad five [days] before Kufa. This road is between Al-Qurayyat to the left next to Al-Bayad, and Al-Manhab is to their right. Al-Qurayyat belongs to Dhubyan, Buhtur from Tayy, and a mixture. If he passes Tayma returning to the highway to Kufa, he goes out to Fayd if he wishes, or if he wishes to the Two Mountains, until he sticks to the highway. Travel on these two roads is with protection (Khafara). If you turn left, you fall from Tayma into the dwellings of Dhubyan and Al-Bayad until Hauran says 'Here I am'.

If you turn left from that also, you fall into the dwellings of Amilah, which neighbors Jordan. The mountain of Amilah overlooks Acre from the sea side following it, and overlooks Jordan and Al-Faljah. In it is a group from Akk, Hamdan, and Madhhij from Balharith then Banu Malik; they are the group of Ibn Abd al-Rahim al-Harithi. If you pass the mountain of Amilah intending Damascus, Homs, and what follows it, it is the dwellings of Ghassan from the family of Jafna and others. If you turn left from Homs from the Great Sea, which is the Sea of the Romans, you fall into the land of Bahra, a free tribe who do not submit; they are people of sovereignty and might. Then to their left adjoining the sea is Tanukh; it is the dwellings of Al-Fadid, the masters of Tanukh. Their stronghold from it is Latakia [Latakia, Syria] on the seashore. Then you fall into Christians and others to the border of the Euphrates to Balis [Balis, Syria] in the desert of Khasaf, which is part of Al-Dahna. From there you go out to Tadmur (Palmyra) [Palmyra, Syria] of the right (Yemen), which is ancient Palmyra. It is the side of Al-Samawah. Among the villages falling in the dwellings of Kalb are Tadmur, Salamiyah [Salamiyah, Syria], Al-Asimiyyah, and Homs [Homs, Syria], which is Himyarite. Behind it towards Iraq are Hama [Hama, Syria], Shayzar [Shaizar, Syria], and Kafr Tab belonging to Kinana of Kalb. Then you return with Kinana of Kalb from these dwellings of theirs to the region of Al-Samawah and the Euphrates. Of the cities are Tall Mannas, Haras, Za'raya, and Manbij [Manbij, Syria]. Manbij is shared between them and Banu Kilab to the border of Wadi Butnan. Then you come to the Euphrates from the land of the Romans cutting through the edge of Sham twisting to Iraq. Its west is the dwellings of Kalb and its east is the dwellings of Mudar. Among the cities are Al-Raqqa (Al-Rafiqah) [Raqqa, Syria] on the bank of the Euphrates, inhabited by mixtures of Mudar.

To the right of that is Mount Sinjar [Sinjar Mountains, Iraq], the mountain of the Shurat of Banu Taghlib. Of the Shurat are Banu Zuhayr and Banu Amr.

If you want after the land of Mosul, you pass by Tikrit [Tikrit, Iraq], and Al-Tharthar is on your right. Most of the people of Mosul are Madhhij, and it is Rabi'a.

Then Al-Sittar, known as Bahrain; it is the Munada (calling place?) of Banu Tamim. Al-Bayda is connected to it, and it had palms and habitation. Al-Fatah is a road between Al-Sittar and the sea to Basra. Among the connected waters are Mu'aqqalat, then Khams, then Ma'qala Tuwayli', which is to the right of Sanam. Then Kazimat al-Buhur is a coast; Farwa al-Asadi says in it: 'Fears diverted them from Sunayh... and from Raml al-Niqar, so they are visitors. It is Al-Niqar, Al-Jifar, and Al-Haza'ir, the Haza'ir of Mudrik. I guaranteed for them that they abandon Najd... and settle in Kazimat al-Buhur.' Then Rahliyyah to Basra. From the waters of Sittar of Bahrain are Thaytal, Al-Nibaj, and Al-Nibak; all have many palms and water called Qatar. And Al-Sabaj is a land of many villages. It is called Nibaj of Banu Amir; they are springs gushing with water, palms, and crops. Its highest part connects the two mountains Aja and Salma; between them is a journey of two days. Al-Na'f, the slope of Muhajjar in the region of Al-Armah. As for Al-Sulliyy, it is a great valley, which Al-A'sha mentioned saying: 'An old woman seeks sustenance in Al-Sulliyy for her dependents.' The branch of Al-Sulliyy is below the hills (Qarat) of Al-Habl on the right of Hajar from the direction of sunrise. Khanzir is adjacent to it, between it and Barqat al-Sakhal. In it are Al-Hafira Al-Ulya and Al-Hafira Al-Sufla, which are two buried waters. In the middle of Al-Sulliyy below Khanzir is Hit of Najd. Then the valley pushes below Al-Barashi', Hamdan, Al-Bawn—the eastern part of it—and Al-Khashab is Arab mixed with Himyarite. The Najdi exterior of Hamdan varies from eloquent to less than that. Khaywan are eloquent and they have much Himyaritic. In Sa'dah and the land of Sufyan ibn Arhab, they are eloquent except in the like of their saying 'Am-Rajul' (The Man - using Am for Al) and 'Qayyad Ba'irak' (Tie your camel) and 'Ra'aytu Akhwak' (I saw your brother - nominative for accusative). Sharing with them in substituting Mim for Lam in 'Al-Rajul' and 'Al-Ba'ir' and the like are Al-Ash'ar, Akk, and some of Hakam from the people of Tihama. 'Udhar, Matrah, Nihm, Marhabah, Dhayban, and the inhabitants of Al-Rahbah from Balharith are eloquent. Diyaf in Upper Jawf is less than that. Kharfan and Athafit: no harm in their eloquence. The inhabitants of Al-Jawf are eloquent except those mixed with neighbors from Tihama. Qabil of Northern Nihm, Nu'man of Marhabah, the exterior of Banu 'Ulyan, and the exterior of Sufyan and Shakir are eloquent. The land of Wada'ah, Banu Harb are people of Imala in all their speech. Banu Sa'd are more eloquent. From Dhamar to Sana'a is intermediate; it is the land of Dhu Jurrah. Sana'a has in its people remnants of pure Arabic and parts of the speech of Himyar. The city of Sana'a has different languages and dialects; for every spot of them is a language. And whoever...",

In front of your face, while you are facing the sunset, your ascent is from Al-Jaysh, then Al-Habisiyyah, then Mazlaqqah Mufa''alah, then Al-Mawarid, then Al-Faruq Al-Adna (The Nearer Faruq), then Al-Faruq Al-Thani (The Second Faruq).

Then Al-Samman and its waters, which are Dahuls (caverns) under the earth piercing the skin of the earth. Some of them are seventy fathoms and a hundred fathoms under the earth, less and more. Among them is Dahl al-Ayd, and among them is Dahl Arikah in Al-Sahsahan, and among them is Dahl al-Samurat, and among them is Dahl al-Dabbi. Their water is from the rain water, fresh. In Al-Samman are Al-Masani', which are pools made from the earth paved with rocks on their sides. There is no permanent spring water (Add) in Al-Samman except what was of the waters of Al-Armah near it. Then you return to the road of Zara intending Al-Yamama.

Strings of Nab' tree concealing cracks.' Then you travel in Al-Sahba', then you cross a small mountain called Anqad, then Al-Rawdah. Then you reach Al-Khadramah, Jaww al-Khadarim, a city, villages, and a market containing Banu al-Ukhaydir ibn Yusuf. It is the abode of Banu Adi ibn Hanifa, the abode of Banu Amir ibn Hanifa, the abode of Ijl ibn Lujaym, and the dwellings of Hawdha ibn Ali al-Suhaymi al-Hanafi. It is the first of Al-Yamama from the direction of Bahrain. To the right of that is a valley from Al-Dam called Al-Rawhan. Al-Dam is a rough hill (Quff) with whiteness on its back. In it are waters, among them Al-Khuwayrat, Al-Thalma', and Al-Akbisha. Then it descends into the palm groves of Jaww and its fortresses, among them Al-Ghabib, Dhu al-Arakah, Al-Aq'as, Al-Rayyan, Al-Uyun, and Al-Zabyah. From the left of that is the spring from which Al-Sayh Al-Kabir flows. From its right is Al-Munsif, a fortress for Banu Amir ibn Hanifa, then Al-Munaysif, watered by Al-Munkhariq, Munkhariq Nisah. Then lower than that are the villages of Al-Yamama: Al-Dabi'ah, Al-Malha, and Al-Kharj [Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia]. It is in the Qan' of the sand—and Al-Qan' is the outlet of the bottom—and the sands. The sands are at the base of Al-Dam, and they are called Ramlat al-Mughassil. Between Al-Dam and the sands is Al-Liwa, a strip between the Quff and the sand. In Al-Liwa is a water called Al-Suwaydiyah in the flow of Wadi al-Mughassil, which is a valley flowing from Qatman, Jawjan, and Al-Sha'nah below the cemetery, the cemetery of Al-Kharj. This Al-Yamama has scattered fortresses, palms, and gardens. A Quff to its right between it and Nisah is called Aklub; it is the dwellings of Banu Qays ibn Tha'labah. It formerly belonged to Banu Sa'd ibn Zayd Manat, but they were overcome for it. Al-Kharj is a bottom like your hand (flat), with fortresses. Valleys pouring into it are Ni'am, Birk, and Wadi al-Majazah. These valleys have one outlet into Batn al-Sawt, Al-Abrak al-Ni'am, for it empties into Dhat Nusub.

In its west is Al-Dahna, and in its east it runs parallel to it. The Quff of Al-Arid [Jabal Tuwaiq] is sometimes mounted by sands so it lowers, and sometimes it lengthens and rises. These 'Arads' (valleys) come from it, and they all pour into their settling place at Al-Rawdah from Jaww al-Khadarim. Then they exit from Jaww and split Al-Armah a splitting, then Al-Dahna a splitting, then they exit until they pour into the sea. Birk: Batn al-Raka' descends into it. The journey of Ras al-Raka' from the dwellings of Banu Uqayl is five or six [days]. From the southern valleys of Al-Yamama are Nisah, Milk, Liha, and Al-Arad. In all of them are dead and living villages. From its branches are Qurqara, Al-Hazmah, Al-Nahy, the waters of Al-Siba'a, Al-Mahdah and its villages, and Al-Burthayn. All the dwellings are Rab'i. They are between the belly of Quff al-Arid and Ramlat al-Warakah to the farthest Al-Washum. So it is from 'Uwaynid Banu Khadij, then Al-Rugham, then Ramlat al-Hasadah, then Manfuh [Manfuha], then Al-Bardan, then Tharmada [Tharmada, Saudi Arabia], then Dhat Ghisl, then Al-Shaqra [Shaqra, Saudi Arabia], and Ushayqir [Ushaiger, Saudi Arabia], returning towards Al-Furu', to Marah [Marat, Saudi Arabia], to Batn al-Azraqah, to Tawdah. What repelled their west—which is a small interrupted Quff extended like a rope—is the land of Banu Tamim; in it are palms, villages, crops, and wells. Then you return to Batn al-Arad, Arad Banu Adi. The first of it is Al-Qurayy, Qurayy Banu Yashkur, then Al-Qalatayn for Banu Yashkur. To the left of that are Al-Shu'batan, belonging to Banu Dawr from Qays ibn Tha'labah. To their left is Wadi Liha; its lower part for Banu Yashkur and its upper part for Dawr from Qays ibn Tha'labah, then ascending.

Then Muhraqah for Banu Zayd ibn Yarbu'; they are the Bedouins. Their master on that day was the leader of Al-Jarba', Umayr ibn Sulmi; he is the one who came as a delegate to the Prophet, peace be upon him, from Banu Yarbu' and dominated Al-Yamama in the days of the Fitna between Banu Hashim and Banu Abd Shams. Then Al-Qaryah Al-Khadra (The Green Village), Khadra Hajar, which Ubayd ibn Tha'labah ibn al-Du'l picked up and shared with no one.

Jadis used to inhabit Al-Khadramah, and Tasm used to inhabit Al-Khadra'. Then you leave Hajr ascending in Al-Arid. The first valley of Al-Arid - and it is a valley that gathers three hundred valleys - the first thing that meets you on your right is Fayshan, and Al-Rawdah called Haznah. Then you go out to the village of Banu Adi, Al-Naqb, then Abad, Al-Ji'ad, and Aqrabah. At Aqrabah, the army of Khalid ibn al-Walid was killed on the Day of Musaylimah ibn Habib al-Hanafi. Then Khalid was victorious and destroyed it at the end of the day. It is also Adawiyyah. Then Al-Haddar, and it is Dhuhliyyah from Dhuhl ibn al-Dul. Al-Haddar has fortresses, palm trees, and ancient palaces. Then you proceed to the branch of Al-Arid and Al-'Uyaynah, which belongs to Banu Amir. To its left is Thaniyat al-Ahis. Then you proceed to the top of Al-Arid, and Al-Arid is blocked from you, so you come to the village from behind Al-Abakkayn - which are two peaks, two small mountains - the village of Banu Sadus ibn Dhuhl ibn Tha'labah. It is a good village, and in it is the palace of Solomon son of David, peace be upon him, built with wondrous hewn rock, ruined, and the citadel remains. Then you ascend from it to Naqil Qarran and Rayman, a place and valleys, and Watar. Qarran and Rayman belong to Banu Suhaym ibn al-Dul ibn Hanifah, and Watar belongs to Banu Ghubar. It has palm trees and ancient and non-ancient fortresses. Then you ascend a pass from the Naqil, and you descend upon the well of Banu Suhaym. In it are palm trees and fortresses, and below it are watercourses in the front of Al-Armah. From there to Al-Ghamim, to Ra'n al-Sawabah, to Al-Baqa'i', to Sari', to Ramlat Katlah, to Khinzir, to Al-Sikhal. All of that is behind Hajr, and before it to Jaww.

Dahik faces you, and it is a pass in Al-Armah leading to the left sides of Al-Dahna' from the right of Falaj. At its top is Al-Halqah and Al-Thamad. All the waters of Al-'Atk and its villages you counted belong to Al-Rabab from Banu Tamim. Then you jump from Al-'Atk into the belly of Dhu Arat. Then you ascend in 'Arid al-Faqi.

From the crawling ones and from the pouring of the mounts\nAnd from an unjust prince who does not refrain ... Does not fear Allah nor pity a wretched one\nThen you ascend in the belly of Al-Faqi and come to Al-Ha'it, the wall of Banu Ghubar, a great village with a market. Likewise Jammaz is a market in a great village also. Then you leave it to Al-Rawdah, Rawdat al-Hazimi, and it has palm trees and an impregnable fortress. Then you proceed to Qarat al-Hazimi, and it is before Qarat al-Anbar. You are in palm trees, crops, and wells throughout that. Then Tuwam, then Ashiy, then Al-Khays. Then Al-Faqi ends, and you turn right as if you want Basra, so you come to Munaykhayn, then Al-Hanbali, which are two waters. At Munaykhayn are few palm trees, and there are no palm trees at Al-Hanbali. Then Al-Firdaws in the middle of Al-Hazn. Then you cross Falaj, a valley splitting Al-Hazn, and in it are waters from its right and from its left. They are deep-bottomed; some of them are many fathoms deep. Hafr Abi Musa is closer than that. Then you fall into Al-Daww, which is a journey of three [days]. There is no water or tree in it except Nasi and Silyan. The people bake in it with the roots of Silyan, dung, and dry Naqd. Al-Naqdah is a lowly tree. Then they cross it to Sanam. Then if they turn right at Al-Mas'udiyah, a ruined village to the right of Al-Naddah, it has many seeping waters (Ahsa'). If you turn left from Falaj, you fall into Al-Barit, which is a place where thyme grows. To its left is the main road to Iraq to Kufa. Behind the road is the road of Al-Bark, and it turns from the road, the road of Iraq, left from behind Al-Hubayr at a stage and two stages. So you take to Al-Bark.

It is a country whose lords are Ja'dah, Qushayr, and Al-Harish Banu Ka'b; Al-Harish are the least of the groups. It is called Falaj for its splitting (Infilaj) by water, meaning its opening. The Falajan are two mountains in Ma'rib with a path between them. From that, the gap-toothed mouth is called Muflaj and Aflaj. 'Falajtu bi-hujjati' means I made it clear and cut off my right with it. Like the two Falajs in Ma'rib are the Ma'ziman at Jam' between Mina and Arafat, which are two mountains with a strait between them. Therefore, biting is called Azm, and the biting year for wealth is Al-Azum, which is the Crisis (Azmah). Azm is restriction and closing the mouth on the molars. Al-Harish is in a valley of Al-Falaj called Al-Haddar, containing palm trees and crops on wells and camels drawing water. Al-Harish has decreased in it and dispersed, and many of them neighbored in Yemen. In Al-Haddar is the fortress of Musa ibn Numayr al-Harishi, the fortress of Abu Samrah, and a fortress whose name slipped my mind.\n\nAs for Qushayr, it is in Al-Madhar', and in it are fortresses, palm trees, crops, and the stream (Sayh) runs under the palm trees, and wells also.

It belongs to Banu Abi Samrah. And the Ancient Palace (Al-Qasr al-'Adi) from the era of Tasm and Jadis.

Around it are dwellings for the retinue of the chief who is in it, and tamarisk and palm trees. Its inhabitant today is Banu Abi Shamsah. Suq al-Falaj has iron gates upon it. The thickness of its wall is thirty cubits, and the trench surrounds it. It is belted with plaster, stones, and mortar a fathom and a span, for fear that it be besieged or the streams be released upon it by the enemy. Inside the market are two hundred and sixty wells, their water is sweet fresh resembling rain water and does not recede, and four hundred shops. Banu Ja'dah have two streams called: one Al-Raqqadi and the other Al-Atlas. As for the stream of Qushayr, its name is Sayh Ishaq. As for Al-Raqqadi, its outlet is from a spring called Ayn Ibn Asma' and from a spring called Ayn al-Zabba', mixed together. As for Al-Atlas, its outlet is from a spring called Ayn al-Naqah. The people of Al-Falaj say regarding the derivation of this name that a woman passed by it on a she-camel of hers, and the she-camel plunged with her into the hollow of the spring. It emerged after her bracelet in the river Muhallim in Hajar of Bahrain. Muhallim is a great river; it is said that Tubba' descended upon it and it awed him. It is said that it is in the land of the Arabs like the river of Balkh in the land of the non-Arabs. The rest of Banu Ja'dah are in a land called Akamah, having palm trees, crops, wells, and fortresses. The remaining of Banu Ja'dah are in a land called Al-Ghayl, having crops, wells, and fortresses.

Possessing return from the kernels of Qarran, chewed.' In this village Qarran are Banu Suhaym. Below it is a village called Malham [Malham, Saudi Arabia].

Al-Khadramah was ruled after Banu Ubayd of Hanifa by the family of Abu Hafsa, then Al-Ukhaydir ibn Yusuf the Alawite overcame it and inhabited it. Al-Dabi'ah belongs to Banu Qays. Al-Malha' belongs to Banu Qays. Al-Kharj belongs to Banu Qays. Al-Nuqayrah and Al-Uwaynid from Ala al-Jabih of Al-Yamama belong to Banu Khadij from Tamim. The Well of Al-Nuqayr in the region of Bahrain also has ten pulleys (qiyam), never exhausted, and many of the Arab water-seekers gather at it; perhaps ten thousand camels are watered at it, then they all depart from it quenched, and it is a abundant, old well (Hasif Qalaydham). Arid al-Yamama is a mountain, a journey of days; from it is Qaddah of Banu Bakr and Taghlib, which is today Al-Tahaliq. Al-Jarmi said: Al-Majazah from the land of Al-Yamama belongs to Banu Sali, Banu Subayh, and Banu Kabir from Jarm. As for Sali, he is the son of Jarm Kabr (Great Jarm?); Banu Kabir are from Al-Hun; and Subayh is a clan of Sali. The dwellings of Jarm among the Arabs are scattered; some in Al-Yamama, some in Basra, some in Al-Aqiq, and some in Hadhramaut. It had a dwelling in Sa'dah in Wadi Nushur, and a dwelling between Sana'a and Marib, and in Dathinah and Ahwar. It is Muslim, especially Banu Dinar and Banu Sabilah. They sometimes fight some of Madhhij and raid them. Regarding that, some poets of Balharith say: 'As for Kabir and Dinar, they have been caught... In the loop of the rope, their hands tied in the snare. And Tariq and all the clans of Al-Hun... And if you leave me alone, I will not harm Banu Al-Birk.' 'Ghayat al-Habl' is its noose; 'Mydiyayn' means their hands fell into the noose; 'Yadaytuhu' means I hit his hands. Al-Jarmi said: Al-Washm [Al-Washm, Saudi Arabia] is from the land of Al-Yamama, and it belongs to the Qarawishah from Banu Numayr. The first of Al-Washm is Tharmada' [Tharmada, Saudi Arabia] and Uthayfiyah [Uthayfiyah, Saudi Arabia], which belongs to the kinsfolk of Umara ibn Aqil.

As if I never defended a relative (Rajmah) from a sanctuary... against an enemy, nor repelled injustice with him a repelling.' He said: From it and what is counted as its domain is the Sawad of Bahila. Its beginning from its east is a land called Al-Quway' known for Banu Ziyad from Bahila. Then higher than it is the fortress of the family of Isam, who is from the descendants of Isam, the servant of Al-Nu'man. Among them is Abu al-Mani', a poet of our time. Regarding Isam, Al-Nabigha says: 'The soul of Isam ennobled Isam... So tell what is behind you, O Isam.' And Jazala to the right of that. Regarding it, the poet says: 'O Banu Isam, indeed Jazala and Hannah... Are damp places harvesting war for you every year. When the early dates ripen in them, they provoke... the chests of men for whom you have not startled a flock.' He says: You are envied for them. They belong to Banu Isam from Bahila and their clients. And Murtafaq belongs to Banu Hisn, and Al-Shatt to the clients of Isam. And Ma'sal and Hadn—other than Hadn of Ukaz—from the land of Bahila. And Al-Far'ah, a valley of palms for Balharith from Bahila. Then to the right of that is Al-Rayb; it belongs to Banu Murayh, Banu Ubaydah, and Lahidah; these clans are from Mu'awiyah ibn Qushayr. And Qurqara from Al-Yamama, and Al-Hazmah, and in it today are Banu Shihab ibn Zalim from Numayr. Al-Dakhul is the region of Al-Hazmah and Qurqara and Tawdah. Imru' al-Qays meant them: 'At the edge of the winding sand between Al-Dakhul, then Hawmal... And Tawdah, then Al-Miqrat; its trace has not been effaced.' Hadn of Bahila is a valley of palms like Hadn of Najran. Hadn of Ukaz is a mountain; regarding it, the poet says: 'Like a smooth rock from the hills of Al-Hadn.'

It is on the highway from Oman to Mecca. It seems more entered into alignment with Al-Yamama towards the south somewhat. Between it and Hadhramaut of the non-Arabs is a vast land that cannot be crossed. Its view from Al-Yamama is between the East and the South. Between Yabrin and the sea are the sands. It has a road to Al-Yamama and to Bahrain in sand. It is a land cut off between the sands. It has many palms of Al-Sufri and Al-Barni, and little cultivation. It has large breaches (Bathq) in the form of some Bahrah. Its inhabitant is from the Lakhums of the Arabs—meaning the clans of the Arabs; it is said Takhum like Luhum. Then Qushayr extracted it from their hands, then the Qarmatians expelled Banu Qushayr from it. Al-Arid [Jabal Tuwaiq] is a mountain extending for ten days; it opposes one going out from Najran for four stages, so it continues to accompany the person until he crosses Al-Faqi', which is the farthest Al-Yamama. From Al-Faqi' to Basra is the obstruction of Al-Dahna, Al-Samman, Al-Duqay'an, rugged grounds (Hazun), and other things. The road of Yabrin to Al-Yamama is in the valleys of Al-Arid. In what adjoins Al-Yamama are villages of Al-Yamama. In Al-Arid is the game we mentioned. From the homelands of Al-Yamama are Al-Qassim [Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia] for Abs, Al-Nibaj for Banu Majid from Quraysh, Al-Niqar for Banu Qatan from Numayr, Al-Yaram for Dinnah from Numayr, and Al-Sirr for Banu Sala'ah from Numayr. Al-Abras al-Sala'i said: 'The doctors said, \"What cures you?\" I said to them... \"A Rumth plant from Al-Ramad and Al-Sirran cures me.\"' Ramad is counted as part of Al-Falaj from the land of Al-Yamama. It is in a Daww of the land, meaning a bottom (Qa'). The floods of Al-Arid pass by its edges; it is a day from it. Its floods appear from a gush (Jashsh) from sinks (Maghayid) from Al-Arid eastward and from the land of Najd and its Arads (valleys) westward, and from the direction of Al-Akhdar in the terminus (Nuhiyya) of Bisha Ba'tan, Turj, Tabalah, Ranyah, and Turabah. It is sand cutting through the earth, surrounding, containing a coil like the letter Nun, so water settles in it for years. Likewise Tawdah in Al-Yamama is in a terminus between sand.

At its top is Ghamrah, a valley of palms and wells for Jarm. And Mat'am is a water for them. The Jarmi woman said: 'I love the folds of Mat'am and their settling... And the livestock of Jarm where its Salib (hard ground) appeared'—meaning its cave and its top. Whoever wishes may take the road to Al-Falaj to Al-Yamama from Al-Aqiq. As for the stages from Najran to Al-Aqiq, the first is Al-Kawkab, which is a rock pool (Qalt), then Al-Hafar, then three stages, then Al-Aqiq [Al-Aqiq, Saudi Arabia]. It was named Aqiq because it is a mine split (Ya'uqq) for gold. It belongs to Jarm and Kinda; in it now are the Kanadirah from Kinda, and in it are properties for the family of Al-Hasah from the Ja'awim (with Jim)—and in Himyar Al-Kha'awim (with Kha)—which passed to them from a mother of theirs who was Jarmi, called Umm Zayd from Banu Harb from Al-Hun ibn Jarm. And Al-Muqtarab is between Al-Aqiq and Al-Falaj; it belongs to Banu Qart from Numayr, then to Banu Hamam, and it is a stage from Al-Aqiq. From Najran to Al-Aqiq is four stages. From Al-Aqiq to Al-Falaj is seven light ones. From Al-Falaj to Al-Kharj is three light stages. From Al-Kharj to Al-Khadramah is a stage. Between Al-Khadramah and Al-Faqi', which is the edge of Al-Yamama, is four stages. Between Al-Faqi' and Basra is ten stages in a bottom (Qa') where the camel pad meets neither hill nor rock.

And hang the swords and velvet garments. From every reddish-white [camel] and old fat she-camel... With hard kidneys, the mangers have dispersed. Driving them is every noble youth...

In the possession of Al-Jawf, then become a stranger to the highlands (Najad). You will see us in Al-Qararah without doubt... Leading them, branded steeds. Upon us is every ample, smooth coat of mail... And swords we inherited from Ad. We will protect Al-Jawf as long as Ma'in remains... At its bottom facing Arad. And we will attach those who crowd us over it... To the Arads of Al-Yamama or Jarad. We spend the night with foxes where they spent the night... And make the gum of their acacia our provision.' Since we mentioned Ma'in in this place, we will mention what is in Al-Jawf [Al-Jawf, Yemen] of ruins and habitation, and mention what the homelands of Al-Jawf and its country and exterior are, and the land of Shakir. Description of Al-Jawf: Amran, which belongs to Nashq. Bayt Namran and the White Ruin (Al-Kharbah Al-Bayda) Al-Hashashiyyah belong to Banu Dalan. The Black Ruin (Al-Kharbah Al-Sawda) is in Al-Shakiriyyah. Then Ma'in [Ma'in, Yemen] and Baraqish [Baraqish, Yemen]. Then Kamna and Rathan belong to Nashq. We have mentioned its large streams: Madhab, Khabash, Al-Kharid, Al-Manbaj, and Ham; then the lower land of Banu Dalan. Among the small ones are Sa'bah, Al-Falaqah, and Ayn. Homelands of Nihm from Al-Jawf: Awban, Ar'arayn, Sarum, Dhu al-Dawm, Al-Aql, Khulays (a well of theirs), Hamin, Kaba, Sadna, Haraba, Gharaz, Al-Matalah, Wasat, Al-Mulayyah, Thayb, Al-Bayad, Nuhas, Tibb, the two valleys of Banu al-Ajda', Wadi al-Shuwar, Sarat, Asharah, Khabban (each of them is a Khabb - depression), the two valleys of Banu Munabbih, Thamar, then Qadib, then Khalaf. These are valleys pouring from the northern facing of Nihm to Al-Fart and the Gha'it (lowland). And what is between Nihm and Banu Abd in Al-Marashi: the border of Rahnah, Uqnah, Rahb, Ar'arayn, Nasam, Malil, Qudat Nu'man—which belongs to Marhabah—Haltan, Sarum, Al-Aql, Dhu al-Dawm, Salbah, Al-Qa'if, and Jabal al-Zahr. Homelands of Al-Marashi: Al-Barud for Sabbar, Al-Hallaf for Al-Humaydat, Al-Salal, Atan, Tafhan, and Marqab—in it is Al-Malaliyyah, a land and valley for Malalah ibn Arhab—and Al-Nil, 'Umq, Al-Aftul, and Al-Shaqra', which belongs to Sabbarah.

Valleys of Wa'ilah: Amlah and Rahub (their flow is to Ribaq), Marin (two valleys ending in the Gha'it), Kitaf (flows to Al-Aqiq, and Al-Aqiq pours into the Gha'it), Al-Fahluwayn (land of Hawqaf, not a valley), Al-Atf and Al-Faqarah (two valleys flowing into Dadah, a valley for Amir ending in the Gha'it), Halaf (overflows to Al-Takim in Hawah). Then Al-Gha'it and Al-Hadn in Najran for it and for Amir. And Sidra, Al-Sadah, Harab, and Arad—which Malik ibn Harim mentioned in his saying: 'We will protect Al-Jawf as long as Ma'in remains... At its bottom facing Arad.' And Awban, Mataran (Matarah of the Najdat from Nihm and Matarah of Ajram, a clan in Nihm from Ajram), Yahir, Al-Hafr from the land of Banu Shahr ibn Nihm, Ar'aran, Al-Manharah, Abalan, and Al-Futul in streams and places surrounding Awban. This is what is between Yemen, Najd, Al-Arud, Iraq, Al-Asab, Bahrain, and its environs: If we summarize the land of Bahrain, which is the land of Al-Mushaqqar, it is Hajar [Al-Hasa], its great city, Al-Uqayr, Al-Qatif [Qatif], Al-Ahsa [Al-Ahsa], and Muhallam their river.

Wada'ah from Hamdan inhabits these places, except Al-Hadn, for it is an abode for Wa'ilah ibn Shakir ibn Bakil and neighbors of theirs from Thaqif. Qabil Yam are Ra'ash, Rahah, Labakhah Al-Ulya, Labakhah Al-Sufla, and Lubaynan. The section of Hamdan ended. From the homelands of Balharith: Sawhan and Minan—in it Banu al-Harith fortified themselves against the Alawite in the days he rallied Hamdan and Khawlan against them, so he could not dislodge anything from them—and Al-Muwaffajah, Dhat Ibar, Akman, Al-Ghayl, Sirr Banu Mazin from Zabid, Saghir, Hadn Bali, Rajla, Dhubyan, Mahdar, Ara'is, Al-Yata'im, Al-Arbat, Adwar Hudayr, Qarqar, Yanqam, Al-Hajar—which is the modern village—and Al-Hajar Al-Qadima (Old Hajar), the place of Al-Ukhdud (The Trench).

With straightened, hard spears... On the morning of stabbing in the gloomy day. And they blocked Batn Najd against you... And the udders of Al-Jababah and Al-Hadib.' And Khazaz. One of those who witnessed it from Khawlan says about it: 'We had at Khazaz a wondrous battle... When we met while the driver of death drove it.' It is called Khazaza. Regarding that, Aws ibn Haritha ibn La'm reminds Khawlan of the help of Madhhij to Quda'a against Banu Rabi'a: 'And we struck the ram from the branch of Wa'il... With our swords until it complained of the pain of the edge. The morning we met them at the foot of Unayzah... With every led [horse] on foot and dusty, tawny one. Because of what Quda'a committed against us and dragged... Upon us, so we marched with the army and the banner.' He means what Hazimah ibn Nahd dragged; he was in love with Fatima bint Yadhkur ibn Anazah ibn Asad ibn Rabi'a. Umara ibn Aqil ibn Bilal ibn Jarir said: 'O night of obscure lightning, and below it... From Batn Takhfah or Sawaj is a shoulder. It watered Al-Jarib, so the harm of its clouds passed the night... In Hima Dariyya pouring and spilling. At times it illuminates, and its clouds fly... Forward, and the dark fresh water pushes it. So the fortress of Dhu Marakh, it spent the night overturning it... Leaping away from what was low of the dune. And it ascended Lughat, so its flood spent the night clamoring... In Qurqara, the valley of Al-Yamama, it branched out. And it stayed in Al-Qamman most of its night... As if the halo of every atmosphere was a star. And it knelt at Al-Dahna, and split its waterskins... In its soft ground and hard ground, seeking to pour.' They said: Hima Dariyya is the Hima of Kulayb. Between the Hima and Dariyya is Jabal al-Nir.

So a gate was cut in the mountain reaching the width of the mountain until beasts, camels, litters, and palanquins traversed it.\nAnd the Cut of Baynun, a mountain cut by some kings of Himyar until a torrent was brought out in it from a land behind it to the land of Baynun.\nAnd the Citadel of Al-Ju'ah belonging to Abu al-Mughallas in the land of Al-Ma'afir, and he is Marrani from Hamdan. It is ascended by a ladder; if removed, it cannot be ascended.\nAnd among them is Mount Takhla, which is a mountain with a wide top, having a vein ('Arqah - ledge/terrace) surrounding it where the hyrax and monkey slip. Under the vein is a vein, and in places of it are consecutive veins. It does not encompass all of it except the upper vein and the one below it. Its top is very wide, containing three citadels (fortresses). The first of them is Bayt Fa'is, which is one of the highest things in it, and in it is a standing mosque which people used to visit. And Al-Midmar is like it in height. And Bayt Rayb is a fortress with a disconnected vein upon which are the palaces of the family of Al-Mansur, their harems, and their wealth; it has no path other than one gate. And Al-Aras is a fortress between it and Fa'is, and it is a wide fortress. In it from the villages are the village of Bayt Rayb, which is the market village where the merchants are, the village of Al-Jawsh, Maydan, Bayt Zuwad, Bayt al-Buri, Sama', Bayt Fa'is, and Al-Midmar; all these are villages. It has gates that are not entered except with permission: Bab al-Suruj, which is the gate of Sana'a and the land of Hamdan; Bab al-Barar for the land of Qadam, Naml, and Sharas; Bab al-Makahil for 'Ayyan, Al-Makhlifah, the land of Hajur, Al-Sharaf, the land of Hakam, and Mecca; Bab Adam for Tamam, the land of 'Akk, Milhan, Al-Mahjam, Al-Kadra', Zabid, and Aden; Bab al-'Ashshah, not a highway; Bab Ghabqan, not a highway; and Bab al-'Adn.

It is closed upon its Maydan (field/square), its pastures, its slaughterhouse, its mosques, its grazing lands, its sheep, its cows, and its horses, except for camels, for they do not ascend it. With that, it has many predators at its top. There are no harmful creatures of the vermin of the earth in it; no large snake, viper, scorpion, Dafrah (insect), Qa'as, mosquito, cockroaches (Banat Wardan) - which are Al-Dawamir -, beetle, nor Kattan - which is the bedbug - have been seen in it. Bedbugs may enter in the luggage of travelers to it, so they die when they become in it. It has few flies and spiders, many crows and kites.

By winter I mean the season of Autumn according to the calculators, which is the time of Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius. The time of Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces may resemble it. Most of that [rain/clouds?] magnifies in the Nawa' (period) of Pleiades (Al-Thurayya), which is the time of Capricorn and half of Aquarius, and the Nawa' of Al-Sawab in Pisces. The time of Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, which is Spring according to the calculators, has screeching, much rain, hail, and storms.

They may occur in it and snatch from its people. Thunder is only from the strength of the striker of lightning and the beginnings of its movement. Every thundercloud is a thunderbolt because if it rises in the atmosphere, that movement reaches the end of its range in the atmosphere before reaching the earth. If the flash approaches the earth, its sound and movement fall to the earth and do not reach their range, so it causes in what it meets of bodies like the arrow that meets the body from close range, so it pierces it with the intensity of its drive.

Then vapor erupts from the bellies of the valleys around it and from the bellies of its ravines as dense white clouds. It appears, thickens, and rises quickly. Two or three parts of the sphere do not rotate until that vapor has covered the head of the mountain from all its sides, masking it. You see it rising upon you, coming between you and looking at your beast if it is in front of you, or between you and your companion if he precedes you. If you are in a time of Nawa' (rain star), that cloud you are in pours down abundant drizzle. Then it rises and thickens, and the flash of lightning falls in it, followed by the sound of thunder quickly or slowly according to the distance of the lightning bolt from the lightning. An example of that is if you are in some plains and someone is within your eyesight striking a stone with a pickaxe or a tree with an axe; you look at the fall of the axe, but its sound does not reach you except at the fall of the second blow, and the sound of the second blow at the fall of the third blow. Perhaps it is slower according to the distance. Likewise lightning; perhaps it flashes three consecutive flashes, but the thunder of the first is not heard except after the end of the third flash. Perhaps that cloud thickens when it appears from the bellies of the valleys below the ravines, wraps, and presses on the middle of the base of the mountain, so the flash of lightning falls in it, so it flashes beneath you. You look at the valleys split by clouds, and above it is the sun. If the cloud clears, you look at the rain water flowing in the bellies of the valleys. If the morning comes on its head clear, the rain having passed and the air cleared, you look from any of its lookouts you wish and from any of its heights. You see the land of Tihamah beneath you from the middle of the land of Hakam to Al-Mahjam and from Sardad.

As for the width of its head which the vein ('Arqah) contains and the gates surround, it is for one who surveys it a mile and a half by the like of it, or increases to two miles less a third. If an ignorant person sees it, he judges it to be two miles and an increase in their like.

It is opposite Takhla from its north, and on its description among the mountains of Al-Sarat. It is more fortified, taller, and wider. Its base is on a land with no valleys, so it is clear for most of its time except in the days of rains. Therefore, it differed from Mount Takhla in what is on its head of grapes, peaches, pomegranates, figs, and other things. In it is a plant resembling white sandalwood, approaching it in scent; it may be mixed with Indian sandalwood. The crops of its head in quantity are close to the crops of Mount Takhla, except that wheat in Hanum is more. It has a disconnected vein and has no more than two paths which only men can ascend. No beast ascends it like Mount Takhla due to the ruggedness of its path. If they want a beast to use on its head like cows for plowing and donkeys for carrying, men carry them as calves and young foals. The nature of the inhabitants of its head is like the nature of the inhabitants of the head of Mount Takhla... stupidity is upon them, safety of side, chastity, dullness of tongue, baseness of character, and its ruggedness are predominant. In the slopes of Hanum are five thousand fighters from the clan of Hashid. The crops of its slopes are sorghum. Its slopes are the most abundant land of Allah in bees and honey; a man may have fifty hives and more. Honey there is six Baghdadi ratls, and seven and eight for a Qaflah dirham. Those on its slopes are people of bravery, beauty, and beautiful women, in the manner of those on the slopes of Takhla, except that these are manlier and sharper.

Its head is wide, counted as a land among lands. Its crops are many, rain-fed and on irrigation systems (Masani) which are the water-drawing camels (Nawadih). One who collected the tithes of the Alawid told me five thousand Faraq. Its people are the bravest of Hamdan, protectors of the vulnerable, and defenders of the neighbor. They are called the Quraysh of Hamdan. The killing between Dahmah and its sister Wa'ilah, the two sons of Shakir, reached in this age of ours three hundred men from all.

It is between Al-Gha'it and Najd.\nAmong them is Mount Tan'amah for Khawlan Al-'Aliyah. It is an impregnable fortress but not like Barat in width. In its head are rain-fed crops and on wells. These are the fortresses which have their water, pasture, and all their facilities.\nAmong them is Mount Dhakhar. In it are villages, waters, springs, and two fortresses: one of them is Kawkaban from one side, and Shurabab the second from its other side.\nAmong the wonders of Yemen is Haql Sana'a. The first to seek it after the Flood was Shem son of Noah after the transcendental drowning. He found it to be among the best of the First Clime. It was said - and the scholars of Sana'a mention it from elder to elder - that he placed his measuring line, which is the thread by which building is estimated, on the place of Al-Zabbir (with Za'). Al-Zabbir is a mountain near Sana'a as they say, and it is the edge of the mountain and the edge of the building. They do not go to Tadbir from Al-Asawah and Tadbir al-Naqah (making the she-camel firm), a firm she-camel. He built Al-Zabbir. When he was serious in building, a bird came skimming over the pool (Miqrah), snatched it, and flew with it. He followed it with his sight until it dropped it on Jabubat al-Nu'aym. He placed [it] to build with it. That bird skimmed for the pool, carried it, until it dropped it on Harrat Ghumdan. So Shem founded Ghumdan and dug his well in it, which is today known as Bir Sam (Well of Shem).\nAs for the nature of Sana'a, it is healthy, although cold is predominant over it. Due to its healthiness, a person wears in it in winter, when water freezes, clothes of silk, linen, and thin fabrics, and cold does not enter them because it is dry cold. The evidence of its dryness is that it cracks the extremities of workers and craftsmen and dries them with blood. A person wears wool, padded clothes, and fox furs in its summer, and it does not harm him. Umar al-Shihabi told me from Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Hadhaqi that he looked at frozen water in the area of Bayt Baws in the beginning of June, and it was clear [with] a little [ice?]. A person does not move winter and summer from his place. If the summer and heat intensify on him, and the man enters to nap on his bed, he must cover himself because its houses in the summer are cool",

He enters the cabinet on his bed, closes the door on himself, and lowers the two curtains and the veil. The light of the room does not change due to the marble that is in the walls and the ceiling. Rather, if there is a clear piece of marble in the ceiling, he sees the swimming of the bird by its shadow on it if it aligns with it. The marble transmits the shine of the sun to the Qassah, so it accepts it with its substance and luster. Some of the Iraqis who entered Sana'a said: It is amazing that a room of Qassah in Sana'a is for two dinars! He means the Mukhayyarah Qassah. Al-Khiyar is a thorny tree like aloe, in it is glue with which arrow shafts are glued and the blade is attached. This thorny tree is cooked until it melts its water, and that glue is seized. Then Al-Ghurrah - and it is said gypsum - is mixed with it. It does not set (die) with Al-Khiyar except after a time after the plasterer holds its patching and managing as he wishes. When it solidifies, hands are applied and it is wiped, so a substantial luster appears for it like the luster of polished gems. Then whiteness enters it with that polish until polished silver resembles it. Other gypsum in the lands stains clothes with its whiteness and has no substance. From the quality of the Qassah of Yemen is that if it is mixed with water, then struck on a rough place, then a man's hand is stuck to it while he is over something carrying him, then something of it is struck on his hand, then left until it sets (dies); if what is under the man is removed and he is left, that Qassah hangs him by his hand due to the intensity of its grip and cohesion, so he stays fixed.

The pot in it has a scent, and the bread in it has a wondrous appetizing scent smelled from afar. Likewise, pots and mugs of water made of pottery have, upon contacting water while new, a good scent strengthening the spirit and returning to the fainting one his breath. These three scents, no land shares with it in them. Then if meat is cooked with vinegar and the pot is taken down with it covered for a month or two months, then you come after this period and find it solid, and you heat it, the scent of its day appears in it. This only happens in Sana'a. A group reported that, among them Ibrahim ibn al-Salt. He cooked a pot of his, and he was a bachelor. When it was finished and its fire consumed it, he resolved to have lunch. He was like that until the messenger of Abu Yu'fir Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yu'fir came to him. He followed him immediately to Shibam. When he reached him, he ordered him to proceed to Mecca - and he was one of the Tarradin (couriers?) - and ordered a she-camel and provisions for him, and gave him letters to deliver to the governor of Mecca. He proceeded to Mecca and stayed until his answer came out, and returned to Shibam. He delivered his answer then was dismissed to his home. He said: I entered and I was hungry. I looked at that pot on the trivets and at that bread which had dried in its napkin. He said: I broke some of the bread into a bowl, heated that pot, and poured it onto that bread until it soaked it up. It was like a pot I heated on the third day, and that was after a month and a fraction. The pilgrims used to eat their travel food, soft bread and dry, unchanged, from Sana'a to Katnah, and further. I used to look at the merchants when we carried them to Mecca from Sa'dah eating their travel food soft to half the way, and dry, crushed and softened to Mecca. We used to use in our travels Mullah bread, Sann, meat, Kashk, and Mahhad. We see that travel food bread if crumbled from the ruggedness of travel. My father, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, said to me: A man in Baghdad asked me: With what do you season [food] in your travels? I said: With Samn (clarified butter). He said: With Samn?! He said: I said: And what is wrong with Samn? He said: It is a type of poison. He said: I said: By Allah, if you tasted the Barti",

Therefore, the people of Yemen do not make their sweets except with it, because it is better and finer than peeled sesame oil and than walnut and almond oil. Due to its goodness, people drink it as a drink. It has an appetizing scent that invites the soul with it to drink it and increase seasoning with it. It has delicacy, so it hardly solidifies due to its thinness, delicacy, and lightness. Samn is among what distinguishes Yemen. You find that likewise in the delicacy of sheep meat and beef. As for the Janadi of it, the bull of it may reach thirty Mutawwaq dinars. It is better than the meat of the six-month-old lamb in other lands due to its thinness, delicacy, and fattiness, and it has no [bad] smell. The people of Sana'a have thin bread (Ruqaq) which is not in any country in thinness, width, and whiteness due to the suitability of the durability of the wheat. The wheats of Yemen are the ancient Arab [wheat]. And Al-Nasul is emmer wheat; it is the most delicate of them in bread and the lightest in lightness. The loaf in Sana'a does not break, but bends and rolls up like a scroll, and the traveler breaks it into pieces. Bread in it is of many types. Their Madir (dishes cooked with sour milk) have superiority due to the condition of the milk. Curdled milk in Sana'a, the land of Hamdan, the east of Khawlan, Haziz, and Jahran is thicker than butter in other than Yemen, with nutrition, pleasure, and goodness. Its butter is like soft cheese in other [places] and stronger, and you carry the piece, so not much of it sticks to your hand. They have with that types of food, sweets, and soups that are preferred over the utmost types of cookery books: Sama'id, types of Baqt, Sari Kashk, types of Hilbah (fenugreek), preserves of citron, pumpkin, carrots, dried peaches, Ranij, and Layy, and other things that if an ignorant person hears of, he scorns, but if he starts in it, he bites some of his fingers over its goodness. In it is the Huduri Madi solid honey which is cut with knives. Imru' al-Qays mentioned it by his saying:\nAs if musk and camphor ... in the Yemeni wine on her canine teeth\nHere ... with the Huduri honey\nIt is gifted to Iraq, Mecca, and other countries in reeds. The description of its making is that it is heated in the sun and put into the nodes of reed pens. That reed is set up",

When he wants to present it on tables, he strikes the ground with the reed, and it splits revealing a standing reed of honey. It is cut with a knife onto a tray or a loaf. In Yemen are strange grains, then of the Arab wheat which is not Hintah (common wheat). If it is kneaded into dough, then you want to cut a piece of it, a follower follows the piece, extending like the follower of Qabbi?t (nougat). Al-Maysani, Al-Nasul, and Al-Halba' do not exist except in Najran. From it are the smooth Adra' and the rough red. And cowpeas, 'Itr, cotton, and Tahf. And colors of sorghum: white, yellow, red, and dusty. And sesame which no follower catches up to, especially the Ma'ribi and Jawfi; it has much light, pure, and good. Chickpeas, fava beans, cumin, and other things may be planted in it. Among the wonders of Yemen is that most of its crops are rain-fed ('Aqar). Therefore, its dough is firm, and its bread is soft. That is that the field (Jarbah) drinks in late Tammuz and early Ab, then it is plowed in Aylul when it heats up, meaning it drank its water and its face dried. Then it is plowed in Tishrin another time, then in the other Tishrin a third time. Then it was sown in Kanun al-Awwal, so the crop stayed in it until Ayyar and was harvested, and no water hit it. As for the low ground (Qararah) in Al-Hujayrah, it is harvested hastily in Nisan and late Adhar. The Jarbah in it is much from its heat, so it is plowed and sown a second time, so it brings hasty food due to the heat of the time, harvested in Haziran. As for Ma'rib, Al-Jawf, and Bayhan, the Wadan - which is the Jarbah and the Zahab in the language of the people of Tihamah - fills from the torrent. When it fills, Tahf and millet are scattered in it. When the water recedes, its plant rises. The Jarbah does not heat up for a month and days until it is harvested and plowed for the crop we mentioned. Perhaps sesame, cowpeas, 'Itr, cucumbers, melons, and pumpkins are thrown into the Wadan with the sorghum seed. All that matures first by first. This happens in the extremities of Al-Juruz, like the valleys of Najd, Najran, Al-Jawf, Ma'rib, Bayhan, and Tihamah in its entirety. Of that is the sorghum in Najran in front of Yam from the direction of Ri'ash and Rahah; there is",

Large ones are sweeter than honey; one reaches a quarter of a dinar and five and a sixth. It has no equal in any country. Of that is the sugar of Al-'Ushar; it does not exist except in Najran, and it is not from it except the side of Balharith between Al-Hajar and Sirr Bani Mazin. It is sugar that descends from the air onto the leaf of Al-'Ushar in their saying and my imagination. So it is by the power of Allah Mighty and Majestic from Al-'Ushar. Some of it may be found in the place on other than Al-'Ushar. It is a type of Manna, and its form is like pieces of frankincense and mastic. It may be carried and large sugar made from it imprinted in molds. I was gifted some of it to a brother of mine in Iraq, and whoever saw it marveled at it. From it is Al-Mahatt, and it is called Al-Qassas. It is a shaver for hemorrhoids. This illness does not afflict anyone in Khaywan because of their use of it in pots and thickening it with honey. It is gifted. Some sultans of Tihamah gifted some of it to Iraq. Letters came to him: \"Preserve the enclosures of this tree.\" So he informed them that it is a plant of the mountains of the tribes of Wadi'ah and Arhab. From it are Wars and Frankincense (Luban), which do not exist in other than Yemen and go to all the earth. In it is the Ba'l palm tree which does not drink except from the torrent. Perhaps it suffered drought, so it brought dates for the irrigation of a year and two. In it is the Qasb of dates which is pounded and sweetens with Sawiq like Qand (sugar candy); that is in Najran. In it is the Mudabbas which the Burdi of Khaybar does not catch up to. My father, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, said to me: I have entered Kufa, Baghdad, Basra, Oman, Egypt, Mecca, and most of the lands of palm trees and tasted the two dates. I have not seen the like of the Mudabbas of Najran in quality and size of its date specifically; the date fills the palm. In it are large Jarbahs (fields) that bring twenty thousand gold [dinars/measures?]; that is thirty thousand Qafiz. Saywan in the side of Sana'a, Jarbat Harran in Sharad, Al-Hadar, the land of Al-Rzam in Al-Jawf, and Al-Harajah in Ma'rib. Among the wondrous wells: The Disabled Well in Raydah.

And the places where vipers do not harm: Na'it, no one is bitten in it nor in a place overlooking it, being within sight of it; and Sana'a due to a talisman that was in it at the Masra' Gate; and likewise Zafar. It has soil that, if a plastered house is painted with it, no flea enters it; it is carried and sold. In Al-Ma'afir, there are many acacia trees that repel its harm. In it is the Mountain of Salt in the land of Marib [Marib, Yemen], which has no equal; it is salt mentioned as having a gem-like quality and clarity like crystal, and it is rock salt. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had allotted it to Al-Abyad ibn Hammal al-Saba'i on the day he came to him as a delegate. When he turned away, it was said: 'You have allotted him the ever-flowing water, O Messenger of Allah.' So he asked him to return it, and he returned it. In Al-Sharraf of Hamdan are the wild bananas (Mawz al-Ari), meaning they do not drink from a spring but from rain. In Yemen, among the noble camels are the Arhabiyya, attributed to Arhab ibn al-Du'am of Hamdan; the Mahriyya; then from the Mahriyya, the 'Idiyya, attributed to Al-Eid, a tribe of Mahra; the Sadafiyya; the Jarmiyya; the Da'iriyya, attributed to Da'ir from Balharith; and the Majidiyya. From them are the Mahriyya camels smelling of ambergris. Among the cows are the Janadiyya [from Al-Janad] and Khadiriyya [from Khadir] in body, strength, and goodness of meat; they reach a great size in body. And the Jabalaniyya [from Jabal Raymah/Jabalans], the black, rough ones whose hides are tanned for sandals; a hide from them reaches ten mithqals and more, up to twenty. Among them are the Shar'a, the coin-spotted (Mudrahama), the 'Arsiyya, and the Simsimiyya. The skin of the rough Namir reaches dinars. These cows have aggressiveness, sharpness in their horns, and valor; they kill predators. They are the 'Irab (purebred) of cows; the others are the Durr (trained/mixed?) and the humped Durba. Among the donkeys for saddles: the Hadhramiyya, then the Ma'afiriyya, and those with exuberance, lightness, speed, gallantry, and wooden roughness. Among the horses: the Ansiyya, the Jawfiyya, and the Hajijiyya. They are horses with spirit (breath), distinctive gaits, and swerving.

Likewise, in it are precious colored Abaa rugs; they serve as coverings for horses and are of the finest things. They are felted (Mulabban); like the felting of brocade, a white square (labnah), and next to it a black, hairless, un-napped square. In it is precious royal silk equipment, and robust leather mats (Anta' Sutt) which do not leak in the rain of days, and wind-bedding from this silk, which is wondrous. In it are vessels of Haysami, which is a stone resembling marble except it is whiter; many vessels are turned from it. In it is the Kadhi [Pandanus], which has no equal in any land; it resembles the scent of the spikenard in the garment; its abundance and oil are precious. In it is the Du'bab, which is the Liy; it is a grain for libido and its oil is precious. It is among the best things a wine drinker eats with drink. It may be dried and ground, serving in place of bread. As for the herbs of Yemen, they are many for one who inspects them. Gem Mines: We have mentioned the gold mines. As for the silver mine in Radrad, it has no equal. In it are iron mines not worked, such as Nuqum and Ghumdan. In it are Baqran gems (stones); a triangular one fetches money there, which is that its face is red above a white vein above a black vein. Baqran comes in colors, and its mine is in Jabal Ans, attributed to Ans ibn Alhan ibn Malik.

There is nothing else like it except in the land of India, and the Indian has one vein. Places of Wailing for the Dead: Khaywan, Najran, Al-Jawf, Sa'dah, the broad valleys (A'rad) of Najd, Marib, and all the land of Madhhij. As for Khaywan, the prominent man among them is wailed over continuously when he dies until his like dies, so the wailing for the first connects to the wailing for the last. The wailing is with light poetry chanted by the women, snatching it between them while they scream. The men of the clients (Mawali) have other melodies with wondrous reiterations between men and women. We have mentioned the announcements of death in the Book of the Bow from Al-Ya'sub. The Famous Mahafid (Fortresses/Palaces) of Yemen and its Ancient Castles mentioned by the Arabs in poetry and proverbs: The Mahafid of Yemen are many; what is in poetry about them is a wide chapter, and the Eighth Book of Al-Iklil has collected it all for you. We now mention the famous ones among them in a passing mention. The first and oldest is Ghumdan [in Sana'a], then Talfum, Na'it, Sirwah, Salhin in Marib, Zafar, Hakar, Dahr, Shibam, Ghayman, Baynun, Riyam, Baraqish, Ma'in, Rawthan, Iryab, Hind, Hunayda, Amran, and Al-Najir in Hadhramaut. Places used in Proverbs from this Peninsula regarding farness: They say: 'You are not impossible for us even if you reached Al-Shihr, and even if Yabrin stood between us, and you reached Hadhramaut.' Al-Shamardal ibn Sharik said describing the winds: 'Where it is said to the winds: Blow upon us... Violent winds coming in the morning, they do not wake us. And every direction for the night journey, they take us... They reached the farthest sand of Yabrina. And Hadhramaut, and they reached China.' He joined China to these places due to its distance in his view. And they say: 'May Allah crush him and distance him and join his soul with the souls of the disbelievers in Barhut.' They say: 'We will reach him, even if he were further than Anaf al-Lawdh.' They say: 'There must be [a trip to] Sana'a, even if the journey is long.' They say: 'Even if he reached Sana'a the Qasbah (Metropolis), and even if he reached Birk al-Ghimad.' In the Hadith...",

By Allah, if you marched us into the water of the sea, we would wade into it, or if you intended with us Birk al-Ghimad, we would intend it.' And in the Hadith, Abu Darda' said: 'If a verse from the Book of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, exhausted me and I found no one to open it for me except a man at Birk al-Ghimad, I would travel to him.' It is the farthest stone (Hajar) in Yemen. Mention of Birk al-Ghimad, then mention of its location among the palaces of Yemen. Abu Muhammad said: Muhammad ibn Aban ibn Hariz al-Khanfari mentioned Birk al-Ghimad while he was in the land of the Khanfariyyin in the area of Hanaway Mun'ij, saying: 'So leave alone the one whose dwelling in the evening is in Ghaur... At Birk al-Ghimad above the hill of Barih.' These are places at the end of Al-Dumayna and Azzaza from lower Ma'afir. 'Al-Birk' are stones like the stones of the Harrah (lava field), rough, decaying, compact, difficult to traverse. Mention of poetry that came collecting many of the dwellings of the Arabs and their paths which reached us and we heard, and that is little of much of what the Arabs know because it is regarding specific properties of places. As for poetry that came individually regarding parts of this Peninsula, and generally about it, no one can encompass it nor is able to collect and comprehend it, because every poet has mentioned places of ruins, traces, rainfalls, and pastures what others have not mentioned, except for mistakes. Of that is the saying of Al-Akhnas ibn Shihab al-Taghlibi mentioning some dwellings of the Arabs of this Peninsula: 'For every people of Ma'add there is an architecture... A breadth to which they resort, and a side. Lakiz has the Bahrain(s) and the entire coast (Sayf)... And if a calamitous might comes to it from India.' Al-Sayf is the bank of Bahrain. Lakiz is Ibn Afsa ibn Abd al-Qays. By India here he means Sindh, and it is said Basra; its region was called by this name by the Arabs of old.",

And Kalb has a low ground (Khabt), then the sand of Alij... To the Harrah Rajla where it fights. It was named Harrah Rajla because it forces its traveler to walk (tarjul), and one cannot ride in it. Hijaz has many Harras (lava fields). The Harrah is Al-Luba, plural Lub. Salamah ibn Jandal said: 'Until we left, and our litter-borne women did not turn... Taking the way between the Sawad of Al-Khatt and the Lub.' It is Laba, plural Lab. It has been said that Hijaz was named Hijaz because of the abundance of Harras in it and the seeking of protection (Ihtijaz) by its people from the enemy. Therefore, Al-Nabigha said, mentioning his fortification in Harrat al-Nar: 'If I am disobeyed, then I will not return... From Al-Lisab at the two sides of Harrat al-Nar.

In that, the scouts were sent out for them in the lands seeking water and pasture for them. One of their scouts was a man from Banu Amr ibn al-Ghauth; he went out as a scout for them to the lands of their brothers Hamdan. He saw lands whose pastures could not sustain its people and them. So he returned coming back until he met them and stood among them reciting these verses: 'Will you not wonder at us and at what... The uncertainty of nights has arbitrarily done to us? We left Marib and in it we grew up... And we were in it in a good state. We rested our grazing livestock every day... Upon the trees and the cool water. And we used to dwell in its two gardens... Kings in the orchards and shadows. Then our Lord whispered a saying to Amr... To his soothsayer persisting in error. So we came driving the weak camels from it... To the land of famine and emaciation.'",

Indeed Al-Jawf is a valley in which is nothing... Except the protruding Arak trees (Rabad) and the Sayal trees. And in Gharaq you have no settlement... Nor is it a refuge for family and wealth. And the land of Al-Bawn, your intending it... To graze it is a huge impossibility. And in Al-Khashab the Empty, there is nothing... For you, O people, of \"it was said\" and \"he said\". And this Tawd, the Tawd of the Ghaur (Lowland) is yours... And before the Tawd are the pillars of the mountains.' He means by Al-Tawd what cuts through Yemen of the Sarat Mountain which is between its Najd and its Tihama; it was named Tawd. In some writings of Dhu Ma'dhin a writing in Musnad script was found: 'From Karib Dhu Ma'dhinam to the people of Tihamat and Tawdam' in speech we have mentioned in the Book of Al-Iklil. 'And your horses, if you burden them... With the tops of the lofty ones of the mountains. I fear a hoof-soreness that hobbles them against you... So they become unable to march from fatigue. While you, O Banu Ghauth ibn Nabt... Are the masters of horses and the brown high spears. When war shows its molars... And the chiefs roll up [sleeves] for fighting.' One of their scouts was a man called A'idh ibn Abdullah from Banu Malik ibn Nasr ibn al-Azd. He went out as a scout for them to the land of their brothers Himyar. He saw rugged lands that would not bear them along with its people. So he returned coming back until he met them, stood among them reciting, and began to say: 'Why the departure of the tribe from the land of Marib... While Marib is the shelter of every content and blaming one? Is it not that in it are the two gardens, and in them... For us and for those in them are varieties of good things? Did not our weak camels used to go early, heavy... Upon the tangled thicket between the drinking places? If a soothsayer said a saying to our king... Then he is not, in what he said, the first liar.'",

Then they stayed in Azal and the side of the land of Hamdan in the neighborhood of the King of Himyar in that era until their horses, livestock, and cattle became strong (stony-hoofed?), and ascending the mountains became suitable for them. So they ascended them from the direction of Siham and Rima' and descended from them upon Dhuwal and overcame Ghafiq for it. They stayed in Tihama as long as they stayed until division occurred between them and all of Akk. So they marched to Hijaz in groups. Each clan of them went to a land. Some of them settled the Sarawat, some remained in Mecca and around it, some went out to Iraq, some marched to Sham, and some aimed for the direction of Oman, Yamama, and Bahrain. Regarding that, Jama'ah al-Bariqi says:",

And many of the children of Nasr ibn al-Azd joined the regions of Al-Shihr, Raysut, the edges of the land of Fars, Al-Juwaym, then the place of the family of Al-Julanda. Account of the dispute of Murad ibn Madhhij and Qasi ibn Mu'awiyah—who are Thaqif—regarding the land of Wajj before the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and what he judged regarding it. This is what came from Amir ibn Sharahil al-Sha'bi regarding the claim of the delegation of Murad to extract Wajj before the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Al-Sha'bi said: Dhabian ibn Kadadah al-Muradi came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, while he was in his mosque in Medina. He greeted him then said: 'Indeed the Sovereign is Allah, and the Guide to good. We have believed in Him and testified that there is no god but He. We are from the marrow of Madhhij, from Yahabir ibn Malik. We have monuments, purposes, foods, and drinks. The clouds of the sky flashed for us, and the showers of the Anwa' (stars) poured upon us. So the young camels climbed with us from the lower parts of Al-Jawf and the tops of the hills. The hard grounds of the highlands raised them, the darknesses of the night covered them, and the bellies of the soft grounds and the ends of the deep valleys lowered them, until they settled in your land and your sky. We befriend whoever you befriend, and we oppose whoever you oppose. Allah is our Master and your Master. Indeed Wajj and the overlooks of Ta'if belonged to Banu Mahla'il ibn Qaynan. They planted its valleys, tamed its rugged grounds, and grazed its watercourses. When they disobeyed the Merciful, the Flood blew upon them, so no one of them remained on the face of the earth except who was in the ship of Noah. When the sky withheld [rain] and the water subsided, Allah brought down Noah and those with him to the ruggid and plain ground of the earth, and its rough terrain and mountains. The most established of his sons and the fastest in growth after him were Ad and Thamud. They were in...",

As for Thamud, He struck them with smooth stones (Dumaliq) and destroyed them with thunderbolts. Banu Hani ibn Hadhlul ibn Hawdhala ibn Thamud used to inhabit it. They are the ones who planned its drinking places, came to its streams, revived its courtyards, and raised its trellises. Then Himyar possessed the strongholds of the earth and its settlements, and the mature people and the young, until they reached its nearest and farthest, and possessed its last and first. They had the White and the Black, Fars the Red, and the Treasury the Yellow. But they were ungrateful for the blessings and deserved the vengeance. So Allah, Exalted is He, struck some of them with others and destroyed them in the world through treachery. They were as our poet said: \"Treachery destroyed Ad in their dwellings... And oppression annihilated generations whose home was Al-Janad. From Himyar when oppression was public... From them against the event of days, so they were stripped away.\" Then tribes from Azd settled it during the time of Amr ibn Amir. They opened watering paths in it and built fortresses/cisterns (Masani') in it. So they had its inhabitant, its builder, its boatman(?), and its night-talker, until Madhhij exiled them with its weapons and carved them with its spears. So they evacuated from it reluctantly and left it visibly, and tried for it for a time. Then Madhhij shot with its spearheads and flowed with its reins, so the mighty conquered its humblest and the many ate its fewest. We, the assembly of Yahabir, were the pegs of its anchor, the arrangement of its first ones, and the rock of its course. Then droughts struck us in it, and despair drove us out of it, after we had planted trees in it and eaten fruits in it. Banu Amr ibn Khalid ibn Jadhimah used to beat its pruned branches, eat its harvested grain, and sip its broken branches until we departed from it. Then Qasi ibn Mu'awiyah and Iyad ibn Nizar settled in it. They did not join a rope in it...!, nor did they make food for it, nor were they satisfied last or first. When their children became wealthy and their number increased, they forgot the good trial between them and cut the knot of loyalty among them. War flew between them until some of them annihilated others. So return our land to us, O Messenger of Allah.'

Their dwellings were emptied and their residences left as ruins, and its buildings. So the Arabs avoided it with avoidance and shunned it with shunning, fearing that there might befall them what befell Ad and Thamud of the exposures to calamity and causes of misery. When Qahtan increased and its ravines became narrow for them, some of them drove others, so they migrated land by land. Banu Amr ibn Khalid ibn Jadhimah stayed. Then Qasi ibn Mu'awiyah and Iyad ibn Nizar marched to them and drove poison to them and led them to death. So they vacated it and headed from it to Yemen. Iyad sought half of the spoil, but Qasi refused them. Qasi was more numerous than Iyad and faster in the land. They caught up until war ignited in its hills, and they waded in its floods and expelled them from its highlands. They knelt upon Iyad with the chest and watered them with the cloud of death/destruction (Naytal) until its soft grounds, rugged grounds, backs, bellies, hills, and springs were empty for them. Iyad departed to Iraq, and Qasi stayed in Batn Wajj having no partner, eating its mallow, grazing its Sarh trees, beating its Talh trees, pollinating its palms, and possessing its plain and mountain.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: 'Indeed, the bliss of the world is less and smaller than a Khirbasisah (a tiny bead/thing). If it equaled a gnat's wing with Allah, Mighty and Majestic, a Muslim would not have need (Lihah) nor a disbeliever have a way out (Barah) in it. If the created being knew the extent of his day, it would narrow upon him despite its vastness, and neither joy nor ease would benefit him. But the term (death) was obscured for him, and hope was extended for him. It was named Jahiliyyah only because of the weakness of its deeds and the ignorance of its people. Whoever Islam overtakes while in his hand is ruin or cultivation, it is his, subject to the duty of his Zakat, for every pure believer or covenanted Dhimmi. Indeed the people of Jahiliyyah worshipped other than Allah, Mighty and Majestic. They have deeds they reach the term of, and ends they arrive at. The punishment is delayed from them until the Day of Reckoning. He gave them respite by His power, Majesty, and Might. So the mightier of them conquered the humbler, and the many of them ate the few. And Allah is the Highest, the Most Majestic. Whatever was in the Jahiliyyah is dropped (annulled), of shedding blood and violating a sacred thing. Allah has pardoned what is past...",

So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not return it to Murad and judged it for Thaqif. Dhabian ibn Kadadah was satisfied and began to say: 'I testify by the Ancient House and Al-Safa... A testimony from whose excellence is accepted. That you are praised upon us, blessed... Loyal, trustworthy, truthful in speech, sent. You came with a light by whose like light is sought... And there is no fault in the saying that is sifted.

This speech entered the Book of Al-Iklil explained, so we neglected its explanation in this place. Mention of the Upper Parts of the Arabian Peninsula which are from Yemen and Hijaz along with the borders of Yamama and its Arud. Abu al-Hasan al-Khuza'i said—and he used to live in the land of Upper Najd, settled in its Arud, mixed with the people of Al-Sarat, and heard from everyone a portion of ancient news—they said: A severe crisis struck the people. They remained for a barren year, and they named it the Year of Al-Jumud (Freezing/Stagnation) due to the stagnation of winds in it, the cessation of rains, the loss and emaciation of livestock, the stability of high prices, the lack of foods, and the cutting off of waters in valleys and wells. The like of this year is called Al-Hutamah, Al-Azmah, Al-Lazbah, Al-Maja'ah, Al-Ramad, Kuhl, Al-Qasr, Al-Shiddah, and Al-Hajiz. So the people came with clamor, howling, and supplication to the Sacred House of Allah from the land of Najd, the sides of Hijaz, the land of Tihama, and the Sarawat, calling upon Allah, Mighty and Majestic, for relief for them and praying for rain. Among the delegation praying for rain from the people of Najd was a poet called Al-Hazazah al-Amiri. He recited poetry mentioning the blessings of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, in it and His mercy which encompassed them and encompassed their land, country by country, valley by valley, and mountain by mountain. He said: 'Lord, we call You, so answer. Forever... You uncover the distress from the creation. Indeed Job, when he called You, was not screened... Job had a Lord for whom the call is not [screened].'",

His Hijazi companions said to him: 'Say for us poetry with which we oppose these two poets, and mention in your saying a likeness.' So he began to say:",

Its wind has frozen, so no pouring cloud... Has been seen in it for a year. And how much have I seen the water overflowing upon the plain... Along with the rugged ground in Hijaz. From rains following rains... Moving slowly, the Anwa' flowed with them. The mountains of Mecca drank from it until... They are like meadows, green, quenched. It resembled Al-Zayma, Al-Mughammas...

From its bulk, Al-Is was quenched, then Al-Rass... Floods, then Al-Marwah, the white. And it continued pouring in Al-Hijr and Al-Wudd... Just as the buckets poured into the troughs.

A lightning reminding you of the maiden, that she... Hung her necklaces, tall of the neck (Musnad). She hung her necklaces, so there is nothing after her... With me diminishing her if I do not increase. And I remembered you then reviewed the passion... On the day of Al-Shara, and I prayed that you not be distant. And in the evening before the road, facing south... Al-Ara'is settled, returning from a manger. My diviners guessed in my soul that I would see... What I was threatened with of the desert of Sayhad. And lo, the desert of Sayhad is a wilderness... A maze whose winds remain unguided. And the murky ones of its sandgrouse remain confused... And go at evening without water and go at morning. A land where you imagine the crow when it appears... A king draped in sheets and wearing a cloak. So I asked when our landmarks disappeared... From Hadhramaut, by which star do we ransom ourselves? They said the Galaxy or Canopus appearing... Then they were guided in their return by the Farqad (Star). We swallow the terrors seeking Amir... Grieving for him if he is not found.' Al-Harith ibn Hilliza said mentioning places of their dwellings and the dwellings of their settling partners: 'Asma' announced her separation to us... Many a stayer of whom staying is wearied. After a covenant of ours at Barqat Shamma... Then its nearest dwellings, Al-Khalsa. Then Mahyat, then Al-Safah, then A'naq... Then Fataq, then Adhib, then Al-Wafa. I do not see whom I knew in it... So I weep today, lost in love, and what does weeping return? And with your eyes Hind kindled the fire... Finally, the high ground twists with it. She kindled it between Al-Aqiq and Shakhsayn... With wood, just as the light shines.'",

Alqama ibn Zayd ibn Bishr, the brother of Banu Suhar ibn Khawlan ibn Amr ibn al-Haf ibn Quda'a, said seeking reinforcement against Hawazin and Banu Sulaym, and he described the lands he traversed from his country to Sa'dah, then from Sa'dah to Sana'a in the middle of the land of Hamdan: 'May thunderers water a ruin at Al-Jalhatayn... And white clouds whose flow is copious rain. Dwellings of Umm al-Husayn I knew... The time of which has become old while it is new. And anciently I see it, while it gathers passion... The era of youth sways in it and roams. She says—she from whose house we departed... With sad [camels] like the bows, generous. I see you have folded the flank in abandonment against the one... Whom you were fond of, and the heart of you is lovesick. So I said to her: I am hoping for a journey... To a pure king whom ancestors produced. To you, son of Dhu al-Tajayn, we marched with riding camels... Saddle-sore, as if they were soldiers. When they were sent forth, they left for the lion (Sab') a year... A meal, and their meal is the lands and the trot. To a cheerful one whose palm meanness did not tie... And whose fire-stick in noble deeds is not failing (Salud). A proud soul raised him to the heights... And valor, on the morning of valor from him is generosity. So when we entered the plain from under Buhtur... And a pillar of the morning light shone. We traveled the plain with them, the plain of Sahama... They have a rapid pace under us and a constant run. It vied with us like ghouls, wide... And a possessor of fluttering above the saddles sways. They folded Jamil al-Khaniqin in the early morning... And passed by the water of Al-Habt while it was Jewish (?). And she bid farewell to the two hills of Thaqif with Al-Ama... In the middle of the night while the worshippers were asleep. She crossed the water of Al-Amaysh when there appeared... From the shade, a swaying wing, still. To a king who gives the creation his wealth... And said to them: Return, and I will return.'",

He lived in Rada' from the land of Yemen, and from there he described the lands to Mecca on the highway of Sana'a in the land of Upper Najd. I have heard something by a man from Basra describing the road of Basra which is not satisfactory, rather weak. Abu Yusuf ibn Abi Fadalah al-Abnari, grandfather of Abu Yusuf who was in the time of Muhammad ibn Yu'fir, said poetry in the highway of Sana'a, a weak Urjuzah poem, so it was abandoned and neglected until it was erased and those who recited it were lost, except for verses that have no strength or nature. Many of the people of Sana'a, especially the Abna' (Persian descendants), had changed things in Al-Rada'i's poem out of rivalry and envy, so there was no correct copy of it in Sana'a. I ceased not to seek its correctness until I heard it from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ubayd from Banu Layf of the Persians. He did not enter into partisanship nor diminish anyone's right. The family of Layf were two groups, a group living in Rada' and a group in Sana'a. He said to me: Ahmad ibn Isa recited it to me in Rada' ten verses by ten verses until I memorized it while I was young, so it will not leave me. It is as I heard it with all its dialects, except what was defective in it due to necessity and had no benefit, so I educated and corrected it. I explained from it what its language did not fall to the common people. This Urjuzah is unique in its art unless followed by a glorious rhymer and an eloquent poet. He had other poetry which was not bad.",

It is You I call upon, so answer, O my Lord... You are my hope, my trust, and my sufficiency... and my Companion in my distance and my proximity... so forgive me the sin and accompany my companions.' The 'Mart'a' (pasture) is the place she grazes in, meaning she visits it; and 'tastann' (pacing briskly) means she grazes freely. It is said: 'Give the riding camels their 'sanan',' meaning their direction/course. 'Rata'a fi sannihi' means in his intended direction.

The 'Karif' is a large hollow in a rock where water remains for a year or more. Al-Haruj is a location in the land of 'Ans of Madhhij [Yemen]. 'Then the rest stop of her night is Asiyy... where the Prophet built his bath. Until when the riding camels fell down [to rest]... and drowsiness began to overtake the soul.

By 'his bath', he intends the Bath of Solomon son of David, peace be upon him. 'Khawa' means extended in his stride/reach, and from it 'Khawa' for prayer, meaning he opened up [his arms], and the camel 'hawa' meaning opened up while kneeling. Imru' al-Qais said: 'Like the palm trees of Shoukan [Shoukan, Yemen] at harvest time.' 'Possessor of a hump, then the second evening rest stop... Yakla [Yemen] and her crossing point upon me are equal.

The land of piety, righteousness, and kindness... within it is my resting place and within it are my brothers.' He said: 'Ab'ur' (wells) while intending the Well of Al-Khawlani because the location is called by this name, and in it are wells, just as he said: 'To the dunes (Kathibat) a path that has been decided.' And the dune is one. Likewise, the Arabs say: 'We took the path of the 'Shaqarat'' while it is one 'Shaqrah' (anemone/plant), and 'We took the path of the 'Dahad' (slippery places) to Najran [Najran, Saudi Arabia]' while they are two slippery spots. Another said: 'When the riders mounted the two slippery spots... they were content with fatigue and exhaustion.'

The 'Atam' are fortresses raised from clay/mud, so he likened the homes of Sana'a [Sana'a, Yemen] to them due to their height. The 'Quddam' is the King. 'Dhu al-Satwa' (Possessor of Power) is Tubba'. It is mentioned that the first to build it after the Flood was Sam [Shem], and that it was inhabited between Adam and Noah for two thousand years. Nuqum and Ayban are the two mountains of Sana'a [Sana'a, Yemen]. 'So it is, by the saying of knowledge without doubt... the enclosed knowledge and the abode of kingship. And the protection of the frightened refugee until the destruction [of the world]... Nay, by the runner of the cleaving ships.

In time, from the glory of a complaint-worthy spring... and it became a mine for the people of worship. May rain fall on Sana'a [Sana'a, Yemen] with a generous flow... and followed by glory of high elevation.' 'Al-Ma'zul' is from 'Al-Azl', the frightened one. And he says: It surpassed the houses of polytheism in the Jahiliyyah (Pre-Islamic period) and surpassed in Islam through the worship of its people. 'A land of a king, he who measures errs... a land against Sana'a [Sana'a, Yemen] which has a foundation.

So it is the oldest, ancient structure... by a truthful statement in which there is no obfuscation. If 'Sha'wa' (calamity/war) clearly bared its teeth... the glory is in it, and the generosity and the cunning.' It is narrated: 'Sharh and the daughter of Bilqis dye/color it.' Ghumdan and Al-Qalis are the two castles of Sana'a [Sana'a, Yemen], and we have mentioned their news in the book Al-Iklil. 'Sana'a [Sana'a, Yemen], may the black clouds shower you... with a frowning [cloud] whose rain is heavy. A land in which I have the knotted homeland... brothers of truth, masters, witnesses. Their actions are the pursuit of generosity and bounty... for within it, they are high-nosed, noble, proud.'",

'Mahdud' means continuous, flowing (rain), defeated; and similarly 'Arid munhazim' (a flowing/pouring cloud) and 'Ra'd hazim' (thunder). Al-A'sha said: 'So a sweeping, pouring (munhazim) torrent brought them.' If the suspicion of a time event disturbs it... The suspicion of an enemy, a war of grudges. Two tribes stood and protected it... Qahtan and the freemen of Sasan. Two tribes of truth, if the perpetrator... Ignited the fire of war by declaration. They were like the lions of the forest from Khaffan... She remained in it, not misleading nor weak. Cool of eye with the righteousness of my affair... Among youths like the flexible spears. Until when the time of resting rose... And the departure from it approached and drew near. The young she-camels with the people hurried around... Wadi Shu'ub and in it is the flood channel. Then Al-Hasbat and it has a quick pace (dhamil)... Then Al-Juraf and it has a slip (zalil). It does not incline from the highlands of Al-Muqaddim... So in Al-Rahabat it has a burning thirst. At the palace there is a short pause... Like ghouls, its trotting is easy. It is narrated: 'Khayl' from 'khuyala'' (pride), 'kha'il', 'khawwal', and 'khayl' is anomalous. He means Al-Hasbah, Al-Juraf, Banat al-Miqdam, Rahabah, Qasr Khawwan, and Khawdhan Aswad next to A'ram. And her concern is the palace called 'Amad... And Marmal, the second for the one supported by the cold. Then upon Al-Hayfah with diligent marching... To Dhu 'Aram, straight, purposeful. Then to Raydah marching, so he intended... For the fertile watering place in the level plain. Rayd, may you be watered with generous rain from a land... A land in which is the numerous spring water and numbers. And security is not snatched in it from anyone... So may it remain populated throughout eternity. He means Qasr 'Amad, Marmal, Al-Hayfah, A'ram al-Bawn, and Raydah.

Then suffice my companions against terrifying distresses... And from Ajib protect our loads. A difficulty, and fold for us its descent... And make the riders and the loads reach. He means the stop of Ajib. Al-Gulah is a great ravine having a 'ghul' meaning depth. And his saying about the rock of the post-stage that it is 'questioned' means writing is read upon it. Ajib is a high mountain pass (Manqal), difficult for the riders in litters upon it. And what is Ajib? If you saw Ajib... You would see a lofty, towering, formidable mountain. Neither an easy habitat nor near... Solid rock, hard, firm, tough. It wears out the docile, noble camels... And the hoof is seen worn out by it. How many supplicating, repenting ones you see... The caller in it does not hear the answerer. With the abundance of rebuking, nor the welcoming... Mention of the beloved consoles the lover. Meaning wearing out (tanqib) appears in it. And he means the answerer is not heard by the caller nor the welcoming, with the abundance of rebuking the camels and singing to them (huda'). Until when it passed Najd al-Dayn... Intending Jarfah or Dhaqin. Not complaining of the girth with the strap... Longing was stirred for it from 'adaj' (noise/cry). Her mates did not long for the fetus... O she-camel, this is seriousness, so hear me. The strong nose-rein in my right hand... Or you will choke on the blood of the aorta. Then she hastened like the oryx doe of the spring... Among young camels moving quickly like ships. 'Adajat' is like 'Sajarat' with longing. Najd al-Dayn, Jarfah, and Dhaqin are places between Al-Kharif and Wada'ah.",

Al-Salul is a pass to Khaywan. The people of Khaywan are the family of Abu Mu'id from Banu Yarim ibn al-Harith, Banu Ridwan, the family of Abu 'Ashan, the family of Abu Hajr, and the remnants of the family of Khaywan ibn Malik. The maidens of Khaywan and Najran are known for preciousness, beauty, and coquetry. The birthplace of Al-Khayzuran, mother of Musa al-Hadi and Al-Rashid, was in Najran.

His saying to her 'Hal' means 'Hali', a rebuke for she-camels. 'Addani' means passed me/missed me. Al-Sim' al-Azal is the small-bodied wolf; it is said when its rear is 'azall' (lighter/smaller) than its front, meaning lacking. So I said: O she-camel, with seriousness, aim...

The place was named after them. It is a place of panic for camels. It is exemplified by the Ghoul of Al-Rabadhat. I have traveled it more than once at night and did not sense any frightening thing in it. They say: The travelers of Yemen used to, if they spent the night there, have someone come out at night throwing embers of fire and calling some of the travelers he knew, telling him about his family and things he knew, and his voice would be denied (unknown). The origin of that is that some of those before us had seen ghouls and Ghilan of hideous beasts there. Likewise Al-Udar, which is the serpent. And Al-Hadhlool is the wolf, named so for its swift running (Hadhlan). Then she has in the wide expanses... A determination of marching, what a determination!

He borrowed 'Al-Rahhalah' for the saddle (Al-Rahl). Al-Rahhalah is for horses, and they are the saddles of the Bedouins. This is the explanation of Abu Ubaid. I say: He was mistaken about Al-Rada'i, because Al-Rada'i is too knowledgeable to say 'Al-Rahhalah' for 'Al-Rahl'. Rather, he said 'Al-Rahhalah' (The Great Traveler/Saddler) just as it is said for the genealogist and knower 'Nassabah', 'Arrafah', 'Jakhkhafah', 'Thaqqalah', 'Nammamah', and 'Hayyabah'.

It is as if he went with the view that its singular is 'Abuk' and 'Bawka''. This has occurred in the like of 'Ha'il', 'Hul', and 'Hawa'il'. Al-Bardan is a well in Tabalah with good, sweet water. Likewise Tabalah is a village with merchants, and merchandise comes to it. It had palm trees and a stream. Most of its inhabitants were from Quraysh, so the Bedouins ruined it. The 'Jadwal' is the stream. Riyad al-Khayl (Meadows of Horses) is a place called by that. So they became smooth like the approaching sandgrouse...

All these lands from Tabalah [Tabalah, Saudi Arabia] to Nakhlah [Wadi Nakhlah] are the dwellings of Hawazin, containing all their clans. Dhu Tuwa is a place, and Dhu Tuwa is also in Mecca [Makkah, Saudi Arabia]. O Hind, if you could see with your own eyes... young camels trotting in Jaldan. Among the people are the awake and the sleepy... and every tough one, steadfast of heart. Amazing, gracious to the brothers... not a deceitful dullard nor a reminder of favors. And every weakling, present but stingy... turbanned with blame, holding a grudge. Gathering obscenity, a confused sleeper... You would know who possesses virtue among the riders. Jaldan is a place, a wide plain. 'Khabb' is heavy; it is said he is a 'Khabb Dabb' (deceitful/tricky).",

Is it to the left of Na'man [Wadi Nu'man] when it split the horizon? You stirred sorrows for one of clinging longing... and the white camels carrying loads leaned away. Dhat Asda' is a place, and Al-Fatq is a feeding place. As-Suhq means the tall ones among camels and palm trees, hence it is said 'a deep/distant void' (sahiq). 'Idiyyah: the 'Ha' is an addition. Na'man is above Arafat [Mount Arafat] in the land of Najd. Al-Hantawah is a place, and it was a stage where the people of Sana'a were afflicted by a year of drought/famine, so it was called the Year of Hantawah. So I said when my composure returned to me... and the heart had something like a flame in it. Console the passion from your enraged heart... while the white camels fold the earth with endurance (Mizaz). Fearful of a restraining driver... descending to the lowlands from Okaz [Souq Okaz]. They folded the mountain passes of the earth with vigor... with hard, round hooves. With young men, not obscene nor rude... no, but narrators of truth, protective. 'Al-Mizaz' is from 'Mumazah', which is dispute and hardship. Okaz is the gathering place of Hawazin and the ancient market of the Arabs, and it belongs to Banu Hilal today. 'Indi'az' is rushing/impulsion. 'Al-Mujmar' is the round hoof with hard sides. So the groups stripped away with gentleness... 'Idiyyah camels with full shoulders.",

'Al-Muf'am' is the filled one. Qarran and Sharbb are two places in the land of Okaz, and this Qarran is different from Qarran of Al-Yamamah, and Qarran of Al-Jawf (Jawf Arhab). These places are part of Al-Jarda'. The mountain of Al-Hadn strikes on the east of all these places from the main road for a day and a fraction. Then the people turned left from Qarran and Sharbb, ascended the top of As-Sarat, which is Al-Manaqib, five obstacles including Al-Ghamdah and others. They descended through them and landed at Qarn al-Harad, which is the one the Prophet (peace be upon him) designated as the Miqat for the people of Najd; and for the people of Tihama, Yalamlam [Sa'adiyah]; and for the people of Syria and Egypt, Al-Juhfa [near Rabigh]; and for the people of Iraq, Dhat Irq [Ad-Dharibah].

In Qarn, there is a mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his well; it is a valley with palm trees and fortresses, situated at the head of Al-Bawbah. That is when the people headed to Qarn... so they washed with water or performed Tayammum. And they garlanded the sacrificial animals as they were taught... and entered Ihram and marked (the animals) and made them known. And the marked Yemeni garment was spread... for the people, then they advanced or arrived. Until when they completed a prayer, they saluted... and raised their voices and entered Ihram.

The Known Mosque is the Mosque of Ibrahim (peace be upon him) at the head of Wadi Nakhlah; people descend there, pray, and supplicate. Al-Kafu and Al-Yasum are two mountains in Nakhlah.

And gentleness and the pure of morals... and be in goodness, may the Protector protect you.' And under my saddle is one of remaining flesh... a Mahri camel, protruding in veins. I ascend with her Al-Abtah and As-Safah... then the pass from Nakhlah when it widened. She rises from its gates (Bawbat) joyfully... to the water of Qarn [As-Sayl Al-Kabir], hurrying the departure. And she cast away her trivets (stones), a casting... until when she came to the open land. She aimed for Canopus (Suhayl) in the darkness when it appeared... and a drink that was overthrown by places of overthrow. Folding Jaldan and wiping it... until she saw the morning at Awqah. 'Idtarahat': She fabricated/acted from 'Ad-Darh', which is the kicking of stones by the hoof of the horse's leg. Arriving with the first of the arrivals... with a rider of high ambition, driving. Kohl-rimmed with longing and sleeplessness... then she set out early before the early riser. So she left Safn on a deviation... to a dragging place, trotting, guided by the guide. Then upon Nahiyah of the highland (Najd)... folding to the rocky path of... As if she is, from the fear of the driver's rebuke... a wild donkey followed by the hunter. Then she set out early while the star did not descend... aiming in the Yemeni horizon for the star. From Kurkur covering the fertile Kur'ah... and in Kara strutting in a dark night. She ascends from the Harrah rough, rugged ground... and at times she ascends plains, vast plains. Until when the wing of darkness went west... I brought her to the heels of a scabby night. Thirsty, hot, wanting the drinking place... then she set out from it early, a streamlined departure. 'Shawdhaba' means stripped/streamlined; 'Al-Akhshab' is the rough ground mixed with ruggedness and roughness. Strutting, she walks joyfully in her briskness... like the virgin songstress in her youth.",

    "text": "Ascending the plains of the earth with its hardships... to Al-Qariha at the top of Da'b. To Riyad al-Khayl in her slipping away... like the sandgrouse of the fifth day (of thirst) in its pouring down. Until she came at the time of her return... opposite the palms on her fatigue. Hurrying (Nasilah) in the palms not from its gate... passing, so she did not twist towards its cuttings. Meaning its fodder. Except for nourishment on haste... or for an ambition in a swelling law/water. That is the light of the sun possessing yellowness... then she flew, what a flight. A swift she-camel aiming for Dhu Samar... with a rider of traveling ambition. Feeling from the pain of remembrance... longing on the heart like the sting of fire. To a young woman, radiant, perfumed... wide-eyed like the full moon traveling at night. That remained her state and my state... covering the darkness of the night and the terrors. Until she came to Turja on loads... and Bisha [Bisha, Saudi Arabia] of the palms without negligence. Startled like the ostrich following... the reddish-white, the long chain-like. So she reached a water trough in the morning, empty... and the light of the high day had appeared. With activity, not lazy... then she lined up like the sandgrouse of the dune. From a rugged dwelling, little of stopping... she traverses the desert, what a traversing. With a rider who did not know what he hides... in the heart of longing, the construction of death. To a white camel with full hair... and a clear, dark-lipped one, cool in the kiss. And a slim-waisted one, slender, with raised buttocks... O she-camel, what does this description avail you? 'Haydi' (Go), come let us go with the seriousness of the trot. 'Istataffat': She rose from the 'taff' (surface) of the bird above the earth; 'Sha'z' and 'Sha'iz' mean one difficult place with twisting, and its origin is 'Sha'iz' like 'Ha'ir' and 'Har'. 'Mashad' means it is a root/origin.",

To Banat Harb, so traverse... to a water source in the valley of valleys. Then return from it to Hirjab [Wadi Hirjab]... to the two sons of Dad, so the parties rumbled. And after pulling, she returned to the gathering place... Yabambam, praised in return. Until when I brought her to Yabambam... and the night had cast a dark chest. She did not desire at the watering to hesitate... except to drink or gobble. Then I scolded the strong, robust she-camel... to folds comprising a dark wing. So she burned without night whenever... I said she flagged, she returned with a swift trot. So she reached in the morning, and the night had passed... Kutnah, as it was a marked place for water. I said, and the stars, my desire, had set... O kindler of... Then she came on a holiday, a day of sleep... so wake up from the intoxication of a day that belongs. 'I am a son of Shahran [Shahran Tribe], noble of root... we ask who was the Imam of the season.' I said to him with a saying not mumbled: ... 'The Sheikh of Banu Abbas, so know and understand.' And a hastening she-camel split away from him, throwing herself... traversing the darkness of the dark night. So she fell after the length of fatigue... into the fertile water source of the two wells. Then she warmed herself like the father of two chicks... rushing from fear of the caller of separation. Rising with the eye and the two hands... twisting with a tail on the two thighs. As the hand of the smith twisted the rope... so she encountered a biting place, Arar'in. Then upon Ash-Shafshaf of the two milestones... then her covering is Sarum al-Ain. He means the interior of Thajjah and the bottom of its stream with Dhuwat Ush, and it is as if added to 'Da'i al-Bayn' (Caller of Separation), a man or a mountain, as it was said of a mountain above Najran [Najran, Saudi Arabia] 'Qadi' meaning 'Qadi Dayn' (Judge of Debt).",

'Mahfudah' (rushing) from fear of the caller of separation, and there is no meaning for this, as the she-camel is not frightened by the caller of separation, but it is among what was changed by Ar-Rada'i and remained with its change, and Al-Jawf is in the place where she fell. Until when I brought her to Sarum... where you see the wells and the vines. She made a hollow sound, leaping, a broken saddle... as you saw the falsified dirham. It was nothing but drinking and gobbling... until she dragged a drawing camel driver. She bore the burden of Uraynib, the burdensome... and from the places of hardship, the rugged grounds. That remained her habit, the core... enduring the difficulties, a bulky nose. How many did she fold in the darkness of the intense nights... trotting to At-Talhah from Nasanis. A correction of a rigid mountain... and a rugged path, cooing in a dark darkness. So she became, before the hope of the friendly one... at Al-Ard from the morning of the fifth day. With a rider, feeling the clothes... awake of head, not drowsy. Traversing the deserts without a companion. Then she ascended the belly of Sarum trotting... heading to Sa'dah [Saada, Yemen], a direct march. With a rider who cast away slumber and sleep... guarding a covenant for Hind despite the distance. When Isa saw the serious march... he threw by it Wand Dar and As-Sada. The plain she folds and she ascends the highland... until she came to Sa'dah complaining of the fatigue. Hurrying, preceding the delegations in it... it was nothing but mouthfuls and arriving. In a dwelling that was suitable for her... easy, with fodder and a clear trough. If she missed my concern to precede the predecessor... then she strove in a dark darkness. Aiming from Qadan the top of Al-Khaniq... and springs for the diamonds and the crane-like camels. For a Tamu' (camel) stepping on thorns... So she reached Khaywan [Khaywan, Yemen] of the gardens in the morning. And the dawn when it appeared in the east... with a rider concealing the affair of the lover.",

Until she threw herself at the obstacle of Al-Faqa'... from the returning ones like the arrow of shooting. Aiming for Jurfah of the branch... then wonderfully with a descent, putting down. Lowering to Raydah [Raydah, Yemen] after the lifting... until she came to it at the passing of the gathering. By the grace of Allah, the Majestic in Made... and His bestowal, the huge, and the goodness of defense. Then she leaned after the sleep of the seventh... lean like the crescent moon shedding (its old shape). To the path of Al-Hayfah of the traverse... she yearns with longing, the yearning of the one pulled away. To a sandy place of rugged ground and wading places... so she reached at the rising morning. Sana'a [Sana'a, Yemen] from the morning of the seventh day... by the grace of Allah, the Majestic, the Maker. And His bestowal and His vast favor... the Beneficent, the Giver, the Mighty, the Preventer. Then she leaned crossing the width of the field... with a rider, a crown of little weight. Her concern is cared for with a blistering march... so I heated her before the return of the shade. She adds Bawsan, traversing the ostrich-like land... and Juban from it with a gentle trot. I said to her when she settled on the plain... of Juban: 'O my she-camel, my family, my family.' I cast my saddle at the west of Rada' [Rada'a, Yemen]... by the favor of my Lord, Possessor of Heights and Bounty. Then be safe, O she-camel, as long as you remain... and graze my namesake to the trellis wherever you wish. And from the evil of coercion what you disliked... and the bank, if you found it easy, you grazed. And the quenched watering place if you thirsted... to whatever water in villages you were watered. O soul, is there thanks for what you were given... from the making of a Lord, Originator, Causer of death.",
