    "text": "Category: Countries and Travels\nBook: Al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik (Paths and Kingdoms)\nAuthor: Abu al-Qasim Ubayd Allah ibn Abd Allah known as Ibn Khordadbeh (died approx. 280 AH)\nYear of Publication: 1889 AD\n\nBook: Al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik\nAuthor: Abu al-Qasim Ubayd Allah ibn Abd Allah known as Ibn Khordadbeh (died approx. 280 AH)\nYear of Publication: 1889 AD\n\nAuthor: Abu al-Qasim Ubayd Allah ibn Abd Allah known as Ibn Khordadbeh (died approx. 280 AH)\nYear of Publication: 1889 AD\n\nYear of Publication: 1889 AD\n\nYear of Publication: 1889 AD\n\n\n[Book numbering matches the printed version]\n\nAbu al-Qasim Ubayd Allah ibn Abd Allah ibn Khordadbeh, died around 300 AH. A historian and geographer of the third Islamic century. It is said that he was of Iranian origin and was a follower of Zoroastrianism, then embraced the religion of Islam at the hands of the Barmakids; it appears from this that he was from the people of Khorasan. Historians differed regarding the year of his birth and death, mentioning two dates for his birth: 205 and 211 AH. Ibn Khordadbeh immigrated early in his life to Baghdad and began receiving knowledge from his father; he also learned the art of music from the famous musician of that era, Ishaq al-Mawsili. During the caliphate of Al-Wathiq Billah (227 - 232 AH), he was entrusted with the position of \"Chief of Post and Intelligence.\" It seems that this work led to the expansion of his knowledge regarding road conditions, tax rates, and the geographic and administrative situations in Iran and both Islamic and non-Islamic countries, which was the reason for his authoring of this book. His closeness to the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mu'tamid and his attendance at his literary and artistic gatherings caused him to delve into fields other than geography, such as literature, music, cooking, and others, through reading and writing. His Works: Ibn al-Nadim listed eight books for the biographer in his index: 'Adab al-Sama' (Etiquette of Listening), 'Jamharat Ansab al-Furs wa al-Nawafil' (Collection of Persian Genealogies and Supererogatory Acts), 'Al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik' (Paths and Kingdoms), 'Al-Tabikh' (Cooking), 'Al-Lahw wa al-Malahi' (Entertainment and Instruments), 'Al-Sharab' (Drink), 'Al-Anwa'' (Weather Stars), 'Al-Nudam wa al-Julasa'' (Boon-companions and Sitters). Other sources mentioned two other books: 'Al-Kabir fi al-Tarikh' (The Great History) and 'Akhbar Ibn Khordadbeh' (News of Ibn Khordadbeh). However, nothing remains of these ten works except two books: 'Al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik' and a selection from the book 'Al-Lahw wa al-Malahi'. Reliance of Geographers on Ibn Khordadbeh: Many subsequent geographers relied on Ibn Khordadbeh in his geographical methodology, such as Al-Yaqubi, Ibn al-Faqih, Ibn Rusta, Ibn Hawqal, Al-Maqdisi, Al-Jayhani, and Al-Masudi.",

    "text": "[Preface of the Book] In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. May Allah Almighty prolong your life, O son of the chosen masters and the righteous Imams, the beacon of religion and Allah's choice from all creation. May Allah perpetuate happiness for you, increase all good things for you, guide you to the path of righteous deeds, and make you among those whose actions He is pleased with and whose conditions He adorns. I understood what you asked—may Allah make you understand all good things, grant you happiness until death, make your share successful in both abodes, and make your portion plentiful in them—regarding the description of clarifying the paths of the earth, its kingdoms, its descriptions, its distances (far and near), its populated and unpopulated areas, and the travel between them through their deserts and distant lands, and the diagrams of their roads and sub-districts (Tassujs) according to what the predecessors have drawn. I found that Ptolemy had clarified the borders and made the argument clear in describing them in a foreign language, so I translated it from his language into the correct language so that you may understand it. I have drawn a diagram for you containing the attainment of truth in all your hopes and requests, which I hope will encompass what you sought and fulfill your will, like an eyewitness to what is far and news of what is near. I made it into a book (2) which I opened with praise to Allah, Possessor of unconquerable might and abundant blessing, Who originated creation as He willed and clarified the path of truth for the servants. Neither imagined opinions nor the conjectures of narrations shared with Him in His creation; Exalted is Allah above what they associate with Him. May Allah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad, His Prophet, and upon the chosen ones of his family, and grant them abundant peace.",

    "text": "[Description of the Earth] This is a book containing the description of the Earth, the structure of creation upon it, the Qibla (direction of prayer) of the people of every land, and the kingdoms and paths to the regions of the Earth. Authored by Abu al-Qasim Ubayd Allah ibn Abd Allah ibn Khordadbeh, the client of the Commander of the Faithful. Abu al-Qasim said: The description of the Earth is that it is round like the roundness of a sphere, placed in the hollow of the celestial sphere like a yolk inside an egg. The breeze (ether/atmosphere) is around the Earth, attracting it from all its sides towards the celestial sphere. The structure of creation on Earth is such that the breeze attracts the lightness in their bodies, and the Earth attracts the heaviness in their bodies, for the Earth is like a lodestone that attracts iron. The Earth is divided into two halves, with the Equator between them, running from East to West. This is the length of the Earth, and it is (3) the longest line on the sphere of the Earth, just as the Zodiac belt is the longest line in the celestial sphere. The width of the Earth is from the South Pole, around which Canopus revolves, to the North Pole, around which the constellation of Ursa Major revolves. The circumference of the Earth at the Equator is three hundred and sixty degrees. A degree is twenty-five parasangs (farsakh). A parasang is twelve thousand cubits. A cubit is twenty-four fingers. A finger is six barley grains lined up belly to belly. This totals nine thousand parasangs. Between the Equator and each of the two poles is ninety astrolabe degrees, and its circumference in width is the same, except that the habitable land on Earth after the Equator is twenty-four",

So, we are in the Northern Quarter of the Earth, and the Southern Quarter is desolate due to the intense heat there, and the half that is beneath us has no inhabitants. Each of the Northern and Southern quarters has seven climes. Ptolemy mentioned in his book that the cities of the Earth during his time were four thousand and two hundred cities. Qibla of the People of Every Land: The Qibla of the people of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Baghdad, Wasit, (4) Kufa, Al-Mada'in, Basra, Hulwan, Dinawar, Nihawand, Hamadan, Isfahan, Rayy, Tabaristan, all of Khorasan, the lands of the Khazars, and Kashmir in India is towards the wall of the Kaaba that contains its door, which is from the North Pole on its left to the middle of the East. As for Tibet, the lands of the Turks, China, and Al-Mansurah, they are behind the middle of the East by eight parts because their Qibla is near the Black Stone. As for the Qibla of the people of Yemen, their prayer is towards the Yemeni Corner, and their faces are towards the faces of the people of Armenia when they pray. As for the Qibla of the people of the Maghreb, Ifriqiya, Egypt, the Levant (Sham), and Al-Jazira, it is the middle of the West, and their prayer is towards the Levantine Corner, and their faces when they pray are towards the faces of the people of Al-Mansurah when they pray. These are the Qiblas of the people and the direction they pray towards. Al-Sawad: Then I begin by mentioning Al-Sawad (Iraq), as the Persian kings used to call it *Dil Eranshahr*, meaning the Heart of Iraq. Al-Sawad consists of twelve Kuras (provinces); each Kura is an Astan (district) and its sub-districts (Tassujs)",

It has buffaloes with no tails, bamboo, and brazilwood (*Baqqam*); its root is a cure for rapid poison, which sailors have tested against snake bites. It has naked people in thickets whose speech is not understood because it is whistling. They are small and shy away from people; the height of a human among them is four spans. The men have small penises and the women have small vulvas. The hair on their heads is red down. They climb trees with their hands without placing their feet on them. In the sea are white people who swim alongside ships; the ship moves at the speed of the wind. They sell ambergris for iron, carrying it in their mouths. There is an island with black people with frizzy hair who eat people alive, slicing them up. There is a mountain whose clay turns to silver if fire touches it. In the mountains of Zabaj (Java/Sumatra region) are huge snakes that swallow a man or a buffalo, and some of them swallow an elephant. It has camphor trees; a single tree can shade one hundred people, more or less. The top of the tree is drilled, and several jars of camphor water flow from it; then a hole is made lower than that in the middle of the tree, and pieces of camphor flow out (57), which is the gum of that tree, except it is inside it. Then that tree becomes invalid and dries up. In this island are many uncounted wonders.",

There is a rock with a tower containing a chain that prevents Muslim ships from entering the Gulf. The length of the entire Gulf from the Sea of the Khazars to the Sea of Sham is three hundred and twenty miles. Ships descend in it from the islands of the Sea of the Khazars and those regions, and ascend in it from the Sea of Sham to Constantinople. As for the rest of the lands of the Romans, the first from the west is Rome and Sicily, which is on an island. Rome was the abode of their kingdom; twenty-nine of their kings resided there. Two kings resided in Nicomedia. Nicomedia is before the Gulf, and between it and Constantinople is sixty miles. Then two other kings ruled in Rome. Then Constantine the Great ruled in Rome, then he moved to Byzantium, built a wall around it, and named it Constantinople. It is the abode of their kingdom to this day. It is mentioned that the Gulf surrounds it on two sides, the east and the north. Its western and southern sides are on land. The thickness of its large wall is twenty-one cubits, and the thickness of its short wall is ten cubits. The thickness of the short one facing the sea (*Al-Jarr*) is five cubits.

There was a portico in the mountain on hewn columns containing several (90) chambers. Among them was a chamber with a high threshold, about the height of a man, with a hewn stone door. Inside were the dead bodies. There was a man entrusted with guarding them, accompanied by handsome eunuchs. He tried to prevent us from seeing them or inspecting them, claiming that he was not safe from some affliction befalling anyone who sought that, intending deception to prolong his earnings from them. I said to him, 'Let me look at them, and you are absolved.' I climbed up with a thick candle along with my servant. I looked at them in hairshirts that crumbled in the hand. Their bodies were anointed with aloe, myrrh, and camphor to preserve them. Their skins stuck to their bones, except that I passed my hand over the chest of one of them and found his hair rough and strong in growth. The guardian brought food and asked us to lunch with him. When we tasted his food, we felt ill and vomited; he had intended to kill us or choke us so that what he claimed to the King of the Romans—that they were the Companions of Al-Raqim—would remain valid for him.

The greatest city of the Romans, which is (92) their sanctuary, is Constantinople, also called Al-Badhrum. The King is the greatest of the Romans in their eyes and the most cherished by them. Kingship among them is not hereditary, nor is there a followed scripture; rather, it is by conquest. Men and women have ruled them. Their King is called Basili (Basileus). His dress is purple (*Al-Farfir*), a type of silk with slight glimmers of black. No one wears purple or red boots except the King; whoever attempts that is killed. Whoever is named King wears red boots and black boots. This city, Al-Badhrum, has four hundred men dressed in green robes adorned with gold; they are for the King's council and attending to his affairs. The Patricians are in charge of Constantinople and the King's chamberlainship. These people draw the sword against the children of Ishmael and deem killing lawful; they may beat prisoners with axes and stones or throw them into the oven, which is a fire pit. The horses stationed at the King's gate are four thousand horsemen and four thousand infantry. The King's army, whether stationary or traveling, has four banners under which are four Patricians; in the cavalry battalion of each one are twelve thousand men—six thousand mercenaries and six thousand apprentices.

Allah revealed to him, 'Do not fear, for I will protect you as I protected your father.' So Jacob gave Esau a tenth of his sheep out of fear and seeking to repel his harm. Jacob's sheep, peace be upon him, were five thousand five hundred sheep, so the tenth was five hundred and fifty. Allah revealed to Jacob, peace be upon him, 'You did not trust in My word and gave a tenth of your sheep to Esau; therefore, I will make the children of Esau rule your children for five hundred and fifty years.' This was from the day the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and enslaved the Children of Israel until Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah have mercy upon him, conquered Jerusalem and expelled the Romans from it.

Above the lintel (140) is construction with those iron bricks in copper up to the top of the mountain, and its height is as far as the eye can see. The construction above the lintel is about sixty cubits. Above that are iron battlements; at the end of each battlement are two horns, each bending towards the other. The length of each battlement is five cubits with a width of four cubits. There are thirty-seven battlements on it. Suddenly, there is an iron gate with two leaves",

It has two springs: a spring at the Lower Gate and a spring at the Upper Gate; the upper one is called Nazkul. (152) Abu al-Fadl, the horse-trainer of Ibn al-Harith bin Asad, narrated that the origin of the Khuttali workhorses, whose breed is praised, is from that spring. In the time of a king there called Bayk, he had many broodmares that he sent into the pasture to graze in the meadows. They would shelter at that spring in the midday heat under the shade of a tree to nap there. The shepherd would gather his beasts to it. It is wide and broad, about four hundred cubits by the same, containing still, stagnant, clear water. One day, the shepherd, having woken from his sleep among his horses, saw a tall workhorse, as tall as can be. A terrifying thing appeared to him plainly, so he began to watch it to see what it was. When the time of Asr approached, it dove into the spring. The shepherd remained bewildered. He continued to shelter at that spring, watching, until one day that very workhorse came out accompanied by a filly and many other horses. They mixed with his horses constantly in the pasture until they became accustomed to his horses. This workhorse impregnated a filly from the fillies of that King which were with the shepherd. She gave birth to a large, excellent foal ... in stature. When the shepherd saw that, he was pleased and rejoiced, and he informed his master of it. The King's joy was great, and he went out with his stewards to hunt, inclining towards the pasture of his horses and grass. He came to the enclosure of his shepherd and ordered his trainer to lasso a foal from those foals that were the offspring of the stallion in the spring. He threw the lasso on a foal among them, saddled it, and rode it. It was as if it flew between the sky and the earth, smooth in the bridle, light in rising. When",

Then those workhorses came out from the pasture with what had been born among them, except for the one that gave birth to foals; they all returned to the spring, and no beast came out of it until this time (153), nor did any appear. So, the breed of Khuttalani workhorses remained from them. This narrator told me about a merchant named Abdullah al-Shakhshi, a person known in Balkh and its surroundings, that he bought a beast from them whose height in the sky was three cubits by the black cubit, and its width was a cubit as well. Among the wonders narrated is that a city called Kesh, a two-day journey from Samarkand, has a large, high obstacle between them. Behind Kesh are mountains of snow where the snow of every year is distinct, so that if a person with sharp vision were there, he could count the snow of past years from every year; and between the snow of each year is a red, dusty line from the summer days, as it was unable [to melt].

A shepherd from this village used to bring his sheep to this spring, and some shepherds would descend to it but not get close to it. This shepherd used to play the string instrument, the reed pipe, and the flute. And it was.......... the flute and the reed pipe (154), and they would float on the surface of the water, listening to him and taking pleasure in the sound of his singing. While he was there one day, having played the two strings and slept at the head of the spring, the people of the spring deliberately came openly onto the surface of the water and seized him against his will, taking him to them. When a day and a night had passed over him and he did not return to his family, they grieved for him. They came to that spring to track his traces and found him floating on the surface of the water, moving along, while the people of the spring were forcing him to play the flute and strike the string. His family pleaded with them and asked them to release him, but they did not answer their request. They remained like that for eight days, with no one daring to enter the spring to rescue him. When they woke up after the eighth day, they did not see the shepherd nor anyone with him from them, and his matter was hidden from them. Hisham bin Muhammad mentioned, saying: Some of those I trust told me on the authority of Hamid ibn Bahra, the Dehghan of Lower Fallujah, that there were great wonders in four cities. In the first of them, there was formerly a representation of the entire earth; if some of the people of his kingdom rebelled against him regarding his land tax, he would breach its rivers upon them [on the map], so they would drown wherever they were, unable to block it until they paid what they owed. If he blocked its rivers against them in its representation, they would be blocked against them in their lands. In the second city, there was a basin; if the king wanted to gather them for his food, he brought whatever he liked...",

He undertakes the presentation of the letters of the postmasters and the news in all regions to the Caliph or making summaries of them.

As for other matters regarding the roads, the locations of the routes, and the paths to all regions, we have not mentioned them. However, the director of this bureau cannot do without having with him that which he does not need to refer to others for, and if the Caliph asks him about it at a time of need for his departure or sending an army whose matter concerns him, or other things for which necessity calls for knowledge of the roads, he finds it ready with him and recorded by him, without needing to burden himself with working it out or asking about it. It is appropriate that we now begin to mention that and enumerate it by the names of the places, mentioning the stations, the number of miles and farsakhs (parasangs), and other descriptions of the condition of the station regarding its water, its roughness, its smoothness, its population, or other aspects of its condition.

A river known as Al-Duqayl exits from it below Al-Anbar; the Isa River is carried from it, which takes to Baghdad and pours into the Tigris there. The totality of what remains of the Euphrates water, after it separates into the rivers to water the districts of the Sawad, passes to pour into the Tigris below Wasit. The length of the Euphrates from its appearance in the land of Islam until it comes to Baghdad is six hundred and twenty-three miles. The Sixth Chapter on the Kingdom of Islam, its Districts, and its Revenue: If East, West, North, or South are said, all these names are said relative to a specific thing. For example, Egypt, while we count it among the districts of the West, is East for one who is in the land of Andalusia. Likewise, Khorasan is East for us and West for the people of China. Similarly, all regions must have a capital from which its directions are indicated. We say that the capital of the Kingdom of Islam is the land of Iraq. Even though this is found to be so at this time, the Persians used to conduct it as such and called it Del Iranshahr (The Heart of Iranshahr). The Arabs only named Iraq by this name as an Arabization of what they found the Persians naming it, which is Iran. The meaning of Iran is attributed to Ir, who are the people chosen by Ir son of Afridun son of Wayun-Jahan son of Ushhanj son of Firuzan son of Siyamak son of Narsi son of Gayumarth. The interpretation of Gayumarth, according to what the Mobad informed me, is the Living, Speaking, Mortal. The Persians trace their origin and beginning to Gayumarth, and they call him the station of Adam, peace be upon him.",

The cause of the marshes flooding in the land of the Sawad is that the water of the Tigris used to pour into the Tigris known as the Blind One (Al-Awra), which is below Basra, in a straight path with protected banks. When it was the reign of Qubadh Firuz, a great breach burst in lower Kaskar. He neglected its matter until its water overwhelmed and drowned many inhabited lands adjacent to it and near it. When his son Anushirvan ruled, he ordered concerning that water, so it was confined by dikes until some of those lands returned to cultivation. Then, when it was the year 6 of the Hijra—the year in which the Prophet, peace be upon him, sent Abdullah bin Hudhafah al-Sahmi to Kisra Parviz—the Euphrates increased greatly, and the Tigris also, the like of which had not been seen. Great breaches burst. Parviz struggled to dam them, even building forty dams in one day, and he ordered money to be thrown onto leather mats, but he could not manage the water. Then the Muslims arrived in Iraq, and the Persians were occupied with war. The breaches would burst and not be attended to, and the Dehghans were unable to block them. So its water became great, and the marsh widened and grew. When Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan ruled, he appointed Abdullah bin Darraj, his mawla, over the land tax of Iraq. He reclaimed from the land of the marshes what amounted to a yield of five million dirhams. Hassan al-Nabati, the mawla of Bani Dabbah and owner of the Pool of Hassan in Basra, the Canal of Hassan in the marshes, and the Village of Hassan in Wasit, when he managed that for Al-Walid then for Hisham bin Abd al-Malik, reclaimed much of the land of the marshes.

There was a river in Kasker called Al-Janb, and the postal route to Misan, Dastmisan, and Ahwaz was on its southern side. When the marshes (Al-Bata'ih) flooded, the part of the postal route that became submerged was named 'Al-Barid' (The Post), and the other part was named 'Al-Nabatiyyah Aghmarbati', the interpretation of which in Arabic is 'The Great Marshes'. It is said that the wells of the river might appear in what is extracted from the marshes at this time. The reason for the Two Saybs (Al-Saybayn): They were not mentioned in the days of the Persians, nor were they reclaimed during their era; rather, breaches burst open in the days of Al-Hajjaj and grew large and great. Al-Hajjaj wrote to Al-Walid about them, stating that he estimated the cost to dam them at three million dirhams. Al-Walid considered this too much, so Maslama bin Abd al-Malik said to him, \"I will spend on damming them from my own money, on the condition that you give me the land tax (kharaj) of the lowlands where the water remains after the money is spent, at the hands of your trustworthy agents.\" He agreed to that. So, he acquired many lands and districts (Tassus), dug the two rivers named Al-Saybayn, gathered farmers and cultivators, and developed those lands. People also entrusted much of their adjacent lands to him seeking protection through him. When the Abbasid state rose and seized the wealth of the Banu Umayyah, all of Al-Saybayn was granted to Dawud bin Ali bin Abdullah bin al-Abbas. It was later purchased from his heirs, so it became part of the Sultan's estates. The reason for the Ighar of Yaqtin: It was not mentioned in the days of the Persians nor in what we named of the lands of the Sawad during their era. But Yaqtin, the propagandist (Sahib al-Da'wah), had estates from several districts made immune (Ighar) for him, then that passed to the Sultan and was attributed to the Ighar of Yaqtin.

Beyond Barqa is Kairouan (Al-Qayrawan). There remain for us among the regions those we have not mentioned, the southern region, so let us return to it. We say that the southern tracts of Iraq are Najd, Hejaz, Mecca, Medina, and the districts of Yemen, then deviating towards the east are the districts of Oman, Yamama, and Bahrain. As for Najd, its beginning is the border of Iraq from the south side, which is, as we mentioned earlier, Al-Udhayb, extending straight to Al-Ghawr. In the west, it is the first boundaries of Al-Samawah, and it is more elevated than Yamama. Most of the districts of Najd have no habitation except a little. In Najd are the two mountains of Tayy, known as such, and their waters. Then follows Al-Ghawr, which is from the border of Najd to the last boundaries of Tihama. It has districts attributed to Mikhlifs (administrative divisions) and A'rad (valleys/villages), including Lina, Al-Umaq, Najran, Qarn al-Manazil, Ukaz, Ta'if, Bisha, Jurash, Tabala, Katna, Al-Sharah. The valleys (A'rad) of Medina, its districts, and its settlements are Taybah (Medina), Yathrib, Tayma, Dumat al-Jandal, Al-Fara', Dhu al-Marwah, Wadi al-Qura, Madyan, Khaybar, Fadak, Arab villages, Saya, Rahat, Al-Sayyalah, Al-Rahba, Ghurab, Al-Akhal. The revenue of all that, which is called the Two Sanctuaries (Al-Haramayn), is one hundred thousand dinars. From that in the south are the districts of Yemen and its Mikhlifs, which are: Mikhlaf Sana'a, Mikhlaf Sa'da, Mikhlaf Shakir, Hamdan, Suda, Ju'fi, Aden, Ma'rib, Hadramawt, Khawlan, Al-Mahjarah, Al-Salaf, Al-Ma'afir, Yuhasib, Zabid, Akk...",

The revenue of Yamama and Bahrain, according to what was established in a record organized by Ibn al-Mudabbir for the revenue of the year 237 in gold, is five hundred and ten thousand dinars. The contract of Oman in gold is three hundred thousand dinars. These are the districts in the Kingdom of Islam. What we have explained regarding the amounts of revenues is based on the average. What some regions yield at this time or decrease in some parts, we do not pay attention to nor base upon, because it only occurred due to lack of control and loss of prudence; and the remainder withheld follows the same path. The total of that—we have repeated its mention in this place so it gathers together and becomes accessible to the contemplator—in gold is four million, nine hundred and twenty thousand dinars. The exchange of gold to silver, at an exchange of fifteen dirhams per dinar, is seventy-three million and eight hundred thousand [dirhams].

What we named of the West was in the hands of the Romans. [His revenue] in gold was seven hundred and twenty thousand mithqals, which is six hundred million dirhams [sic] in silver. Qudama said: The regions, in my opinion, are in the same state they were at that time; their lands have not perished nor have their inhabitants vanished. What is required is that their administrator have fear of Allah first, then knowledge, justice, and integrity, so that affairs are set straight, management is organized, and wealth comes in such amounts that the wonderer would wonder at it. Chapter Seven: Mentioning the Frontiers (Thughur) of Islam and the Nations and Peoples Surrounding Them. The nations and generations opposing Islam surround it from all its sides and the ends of its districts. Some of them are close to the abode of its kingdom, and some are distant from it. The Kings of the Sects (Muluk al-Tawa'if), whom Dhu al-Qarnayn appointed as kings, used to pay tribute to the King of the Romans for five hundred and eleven years, until Ardashir bin Babak gathered the kingdom after hardship and long struggle. He then withheld the tribute that the Persians used to pay to the Romans after hardship. It is appropriate that the Muslims should not be more cautious of any of their varieties of enemies than they are of the Romans. Verses have come regarding that, through which the truth of what I said appears, and Allah is the Grantor of success for the best interest by His power. Since the Romans are as I described, it is necessary that we present the discussion of the frontiers facing their land over...",

We say that these frontiers: some are on land, met by the land of the enemy and approaching it by land; and some are maritime, met and faced by it from the sea; and some where both matters combine, and expeditions by its people occur by land and sea. The maritime frontiers in general are all the coasts of the Levant and Egypt. The place where both matters combine, land and sea raids, are the frontiers known as the Syrian (Shami) ones. Let us begin by mentioning them: They are Tarsus, Adana, Al-Massisah, Ayn Zarba, Al-Kanisah, Al-Haruniyyah, Bayas, and Niqabulus. Their revenue is about one hundred thousand dinars, spent on their interests and other aspects of their affairs, namely the watchtowers, guards, scouts, couriers, those entrusted with the mountain passes and fords, fortresses, and other similar matters and conditions. It requires for its garrison of soldiers and vagabonds (Sa'alik - volunteers), and the salaries for its expeditions—summer and winter raids by land and sea—annually on approximation two hundred thousand dinars, and on ample estimation, meaning for it to be spacious, three hundred thousand dinars. What meets it of the enemy's land and connects to it: from the land side is Cappadocia (Al-Qabadiq), and near it is the Anatolic [Theme] (Al-Nataliq); and from the sea side is Seleucia. The Awasim (Protecting Strongholds) of these frontiers and what is behind them towards us are the lands of Islam. Each one of them was named 'Asim' (Protector) because it protects the frontier and reinforces it in times of mobilization. Then the people of Antioch, Al-Jumah, and Al-Quris mobilize to it. Then adjacent to these frontiers on their right and the north side are the frontiers known as the Jaziran (Mesopotamian) ones. The first of the Syrian frontiers it borders is Marash, followed by the frontier of Al-Hadath. Zabatrah used to follow this, but it was destroyed in the days of Al-Mu'tasim. He had, when rising to the land of the enemy until he conquered Amorium, the famous story. When he reached the site of Zabatrah, he built fortresses in its place and near it to stand in its stead: the fortress known as Tabarji, the fortress known as Al-Husayniyyah, the fortress known as Bani al-Mu'min, and the fortress known as Ibn Rahwan.

Between each one of them and the enemy's land is a mountain pass and an obstacle, but the frontier of Malatya is with the enemy's land in one plot and ground. Facing these frontiers and opposite them from the land of the Romans was Charsianon (Kharshana) and the district of Chaldia (Al-Khalidiyyah). In this time, there occurred between them and the Romans and the Armenians who are with Mleh the Armenian, in a land inhabited by a people called 'Al-?? Al-Qah' [Paulicians?], who are from the Romans except that they differ from them in many of their religious beliefs. These people were with the Muslims, aiding them in their raids, and the assistance through them was abundant for the Muslims, until they departed all at once from this place due to the mistreatment by the people of the frontiers in associating with them and the lack of oversight by the administrators regarding their affair. So they dispersed in the lands, and these Armenians dwelled in their place, built impregnable fortresses, and then acquired a dense troop and severe harm [to others]. The revenue of these frontiers with Malatya is seventy thousand dinars, of which forty thousand dinars is spent on their interests, leaving thirty thousand dinars. It requires for the expense of the allies and vagabonds (volunteers) on a partitioned basis one hundred and twenty thousand dinars added to the remainder; and on an ample basis one hundred and seventy thousand dinars added to it to complete two hundred thousand dinars, excluding the expenses of raids at their times. These frontiers are the middle ones, and from them raids used to occur; if a raid was needed from them, the expense was according to the raiders. The Awasim (Protecting Strongholds) of these frontiers are Duluk, Ra'ban, and Manbij. Adjacent to these frontiers on the right also, and in the north direction, are the frontiers named Al-Bakriyyah, which are Sumaysat, Hani, Malkin, and fortresses including Jumah, Hawran, Al-Kils, and others.

The revenue of these frontiers per year is one million and three hundred thousand dirhams. Its expenses for its interests, fortresses, and the salaries of its garrisons require this amount plus an increase of one million and seven hundred thousand dirhams, completing three million dirhams. As for the maritime frontiers, they are the coasts of Jund Homs: Antartus, Balaniyas, Latakia, Jableh, and Al-hariyadha; and the coasts of Jund Damascus: Arqa, Tripoli, Jubayl, Beirut, Sidon, Hisn al-Sarafand, and Adnun; and the coasts of Jund al-Urdunn: Tyre and Acre—and in Tyre is the shipbuilding industry; and the coasts of Jund Filastin: Caesarea, Arsuf, Jaffa, Ashkelon, and Gaza; and the coasts of Egypt: Rafah, Al-Farama, and Al-Arish. The amount that raids in the expedition from the ships of the Syrian frontiers, including what gathers to them from the ships of the Levant and Egypt, is from eighty to one hundred [ships]. If they resolve on a raid in the sea, the masters of Egypt and the Levant correspond to work on that and prepare for it. They gather at the island of Cyprus.

One of its borders from the west is the Anatolic; from the south, the Sea; from the north, Thracesion; and from the east, a pass to Tarsus in the direction of Qalamiyah and Al-Lamis. Its army is five thousand men. Then follows it the district of Cappadocia (Al-Qabadiq). Its border from the south is the mountain of Tarsus, Adana, and Al-Massisah; from the west, the districts of Seleucia; from the north, the Anatolic; and from the east, the districts of Charsianon. Its army is four thousand men. Then follows that the district of Charsianon (Kharshana). One of its borders, the southern, is to Cappadocia; a border to the passes of Malatya, which is the eastern; a border to the district of the Armeniac, which is the northern; and a border to the district of the Bucellarian, which is the western. Its army is four thousand men. Then follows it the district of the Bucellarian (Al-Baqlar). A border of it is the district of the Anatolic and Optimatoi; the second is Cappadocia; the third is Charsianon; and the fourth is the Armeniac. Its army is eight thousand men. The district of the Armeniac (Al-Arminyaq): a border of it is to Paphlagonia; the second is the district of the Bucellarian; the third is the district of Charsianon; and the fourth is the district of Chaldia and the Sea of the Khazars. Its army is four thousand men. Then the district of Chaldia (Al-Khalidiyyah): a border of it is the lands of Armenia; the second is the Sea of the Khazars; the third is the Armeniac; and the fourth is also from the district of the Armeniac. Its army is four thousand men. So the entire army of the eleven districts which are...",

Then we follow that with a description of one of the days of raids so that the knowledge of that is acquired and preserved. We say that the most strenuous of them, according to what the experienced people of the frontiers know, is for the raid called 'The Spring Raid' to occur when ten days have passed from Iyyar (May), after the people have grazed their beasts on spring grass and the conditions of their horses have improved. They stay for thirty days, which is the remainder of Iyyar and ten of Haziran (June), for they find the pasture in the land of the Romans possible, as if their beasts are grazing a second spring. Then they return and stay until twenty-five days, which is the remainder of Haziran and five of Tammuz (July), until the mounts become strong and fat and the people gather for the Summer Raid. Then they raid when ten days have passed from Tammuz, staying until the time of their return, sixty days. As for the Winter Raids, I have seen them all say: if it is inevitable, let it be one where one does not go far nor penetrate deeply, and let its march be twenty nights, the amount that a man carries for his horse sufficient on its back. Let that be at the end of Shubat (February), so the raiders stay until days pass from Adhar (March), for they find the enemy at that time to be weakest in spirit and beasts, and they find their livestock plentiful. Then they return and graze their beasts on spring grass, racing each other. Let us begin by mentioning what adjoins it from the north, taking the right until we come to the edges of the kingdom and beyond the frontiers, until we return to the borders of the Romans from the west side. We say that the border of the Khazars is from Armenia to Khwarazm of Khorasan. Anushirvan bin Qabad, when he reigned, built the city of Al-Shabaran, the city of Masqat, and the city of Al-Bab wa Al-Abwab (The Gate of Gates / Derbent) in Armenia. They were named 'Gates' because they were built on roads in the mountain. He settled in what he built of his soldiers a people he named...",

Then, when he feared the aggression of the Khazars, he wrote to their king asking him for truce and peace, and that their matter should be one, and he asked for his daughter's hand to reassure him with that, showing him desire for marriage alliance. He sent him a daughter who was in his palace, whom one of his women had adopted, and mentioned to him that she was his daughter. The Khazar [king] gifted his daughter to him, then came to him. They met at a place known as Barshaliyah and drank together for days. Each of them became familiar with his companion and showed his kindness and honor. Then Anushirvan advanced to a group of his trustworthy and special men [ordering them] to raid a side of the Khazar's camp and set fire to it. When morning came, he complained of that to Anushirvan, who denied knowing anything about it. When nights passed for him, Anushirvan ordered his companions to repeat what they had done. When they did, the Khazar clamored from their deed until Anushirvan was gentle with him and apologized to him, so he accepted and calmed down. Then Anushirvan ordered fire to be thrown in a side of his [own] camp, and it fell upon the huts made of grass and tree branches. When morning came, Anushirvan clamored to the Khazar, saying, 'Your companions almost took away my camp and destroyed it! You have repaid me with suspicion.' He swore to him that he did not know of what happened. Anushirvan said to him, 'O my brother, my soldiers and your soldiers have hated our peace because of the cessation of what ceased for them of marching in raids that used to be between us. I do not feel safe that they might cause events that spoil our hearts after our purity and sincerity, so that we return to enmity after marriage and affection. The right thing is that you permit me to build a wall that will be between me and you, and we make a gate for it so that no one enters us from your side except whom we want.' He agreed to that. The Khazar returned, and Anushirvan stayed to build the wall. He built it, making it from the sea side with rock and lead, and made its width three hundred cubits until he joined it to the mountains. He ordered stones to be carried in ships and...",

When he finished building it, he hung iron gates on the entrance and entrusted it to one hundred knights to guard the place, after having needed fifty thousand soldiers. He placed a tank (dabbabah) on it. It was said to the Khazar after that, 'He tricked you, married you to other than his daughter, and fortified himself against you.' He could find no stratagem against him. Since that time, the Khazar raids have been on the outskirts of Armenia after they had previously devastated it. Then follows this place also on the right the frontiers of Daylam, Gilan, Al-Babr, and Al-Taylasan. The fortress of Qazvin was called in Persian 'Kashwin', the interpretation of which is 'The Watched Border'. Between it and Daylam is a mountain. Persian fighters from the Asawirah (Cavalry) ceased not to be stationed in it, repelling the Daylam if there was no truce between them, and guarding that direction from their bandits. Dashtabi was divided between Rayy and Hamadhan; a part was called Razi and a part called Hamadhani. The raids of the Muslims in the beginning of Islam were in Dashtabi and Abhar, which is a fortress claimed to have been built by some of the Khosrows over springs. The conditions of the Daylam ceased not to be fluctuating because they have no established law nor stable obedience, for after their conquest they broke [treaties] and disbelieved more than once. In this time, there occurred from them matters deemed atrocious regarding the killing of children, debauchery in mosques, and abandoning prayer and the obligations of Islam. Among the great frontiers is the frontier of the Turks. They have a desert adjacent to the land of Jurjan from which they emerge. Its people had built a wall of baked brick upon it as fortification against...",

Most of the Turks are in the frontier that is in Khorasan; it is called Nushajan, and it is beyond Samarkand in the east by about sixty farsakhs towards Shash and Ferghana. It is the beginning of the garrisons of the Karluks (Kharlukhiyya) up to the border of Kimak. From this frontier to the city of the Taghazghuz (Toquz Oghuz) is a journey of forty-five days in deserts containing springs and pasture for twenty days, then large villages for twenty-five days. Most of the people of those villages are Magians (Majus), and among them are Manichaeans (Zanadiqa). Near the city of the Taghazghuz is a lake around which are villages and connected buildings. It has twelve gates of iron, and Turks guard it. They are all Manichaeans. Between Upper Nushajan and the land of Shash is forty stages for caravans, and for the fast traveler thirty days. Upper Nushajan has four large cities and five small ones. The fighters of Nushajan are in one city on the shore of a lake; they are twenty thousand men on the registry. There is no one among the Turks fiercer than them; they count ten against a hundred of the Karluks. The neighborhood upon which is the city of the Taghazghuz is surrounded by mountains from a distance. As for the lands of Kimak, they are from the direction of the city of Lower Nushajan, which we said is beyond Samarkand by sixty-five farsakhs, to the left of it and in the north direction. Between it and Taraz is a journey of eighty days in deserts and vast wildernesses with much pasture and springs. The Muslims hardly raid the Turks because of the saying of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Leave the Turks alone as long as they leave you alone.' We only...",

As for Tibet, it is to the right of the lands of the Taghazghuz in the south direction. Dhu al-Qarnayn (Alexander), when he triumphed over Fur (Porus), the King of India, and killed him, stayed in the land of India for seven months and sent armies from it to Tibet and China. Some of those whom he sent came to him and informed him that all the kings of the East had agreed to enter into obedience and pay him tribute when they knew of his victory over Darius and Porus, the kings of the Persians and India, and his justice and good conduct. He left behind in the land of India those he trusted with thirty thousand [men] and marched until he came to the lands of Tibet. Their king came out to him with his Tarkhans (nobles), surrendering to him, and said to him, 'There has reached me about you, O King, of justice and fulfillment along with victory over those who opposed you, that by which I knew that your entire affair is from Allah. I liked to place my hand in your hand, and I do not desire to repel you from anything you want nor fight you, for he who fights you and contends with you only contends with the command of Allah, and he who contends with the command of Allah is defeated. I, my people, and the kingdom in my hand are yours, so command in all of that whatever you wish.' Alexander replied to him graciously and said to him, 'Whoever knows the right of Allah, his right becomes incumbent upon us. I hope you find with us the justice and fulfillment that satisfies you.' He asked him for guidance to the Turks of the deserts because the Turks of the cities had entered into his obedience. He walked before him and presented him with gifts, which he refused. He ceased not to repeat [the offer] until he agreed to accept them. He carried to him four thousand donkey loads of gold and the like of musk. He gave a tenth of the musk to Roshanak (Roxane), daughter of Darius, King of the Persians, his wife, and distributed the rest to his companions, and placed the gold in his treasury. The King of Tibet spoke to him about advancing him in his armies to China. The King ordered him to appoint his son as successor over his kingdom, so he appointed his son Madabik as successor in his land after him.

He sent to Alexander mentioning to him what had reached him about his fulfillment and noble action, and that he could not fight him given this situation, though if he wanted that, he would not be incapable of it. He asked him to command what he wanted so he could comply. Alexander answered him and ordered him to carry the tithe (tenth) of his land according to what he did in others of the rest of the countries, and that if he did not do so, he would seek Allah's help against him, and his large number did not frighten him because Allah is capable of granting victory to the few over the many. He sent this answer to him with a group of Persians and Indians and ordered them to inform him of his justice in their lands, his beautiful action among them, and his good deed to them. The King of China returned the answer with obedience, asking that he accept from him in what he pays of the tithe of his lands and his peace treaty: silk, firinda (silk fabric), and other tools. Alexander was satisfied with that and accepted it from him. What he settled with him was one million firindas, one million bundles of silk, five hundred thousand kimkhawah (damask silk), and ten thousand saddles with their stirrups, bridles, straps, and all their tools, and one million manas of silver. He paid that. Alexander stayed in his land until he built a city he named the Tower of Stone (Burj al-Hijara) and placed in it a garrison of five thousand Persians, appointing over them a companion of his known as Nicoclides. He marched from China taking the north direction, and the Master of China was with him, until he ended at the land of Shul. He conquered it and built two cities there, one Shul and the other Khamdan. He ordered the Master of China to inhabit Khamdan with his soldiers and to place a garrison of his companions in Shul. Then he marched heading to the Turks of the Desert until he conquered them and subdued them. It reached him about a people with a large number of these Turks in the eastern side from the north direction that they were corrupters in the land. He consulted the Master of China about them. He informed him that they had no booty other than livestock and iron, and that the Green Sea, which has no passage...",

There is no outlet for these Turks except from one narrow pass like a shoelace. They are in a corner of the earth; if this outlet were blocked against them, they would remain in it, the people would be sufficed from their evil, and corruption would cease from the earth. Alexander knew the face of correctness in what the Master of China advised, so he blocked that valley, which is the Dam (Al-Sadd) that Allah described and narrated its news in the Quran. Then Dhu al-Qarnayn returned to the land of the Turks of the Cities and the people of idols until he ended at the land of Sogdia (Al-Sughd), so he built Samarkand and the city known as Dabbusiya and Alexandria the Farthest (Eschate). Then he came to the land of Bukhara and built the city of Bukhara. Then he marched to the land of Merv and built its city. He built the two cities of Herat and Zaranj, exited to Jurjan, and ordered the building of Rayy, Isfahan, and Hamadhan, until he returned to the land of Babylon, where he stayed for years. Since we have finished mentioning the frontiers of the East, let us return to the south side. In it is the frontier of the Beja and Nubia; they are reconciled upon a tax called the Baqt, and there is no war or investigation between them and the Muslims. The matter of their peace will be in the Seventh Stage, which follows this chapter, if Allah wills, and in Him is strength. Then we mention after that the frontiers of the West. We say that the first of them is Ifriqiya, which is named Kairouan (Al-Qayrawan). Since it was opened, it ceased not to be managed on behalf of the King of Iraq after the rule of the Banu Marwan, until the Master of the Maghreb overcame it in this time, seized it, and exceeded it to Barqa, so he overcame it as an addition. As for beyond Ifriqiya, it is the lands of Tahert; between it and Ifriqiya is a journey of thirty days. It is in the hand of the Master of the Ibadiyyah, and they are a type of Kharijites. Beyond Tahert by a journey of twenty-four days is the country of the Mu'tazila; over them is a just chief, his justice is overflowing, his conduct is praiseworthy, and his abode is Tangier and its surroundings.",
