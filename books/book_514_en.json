    "text": "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Your pardon, O God. Praise be to God, who created human minds diverse, and made souls revolve around the point of contentment in their opinions, and adorned their deeds for them until they imagined they were among the current proverbs (al-amthal al-sa'irah). I praise Him for His blessings that clarified what was ambiguous and confused, and revealed the fire of guidance that could only be kindled by the fingers of taste, and trained the steed of criticism which, when it aims for a goal, does not turn its rein nor hold back. I bear witness that there is no god but God alone, with no partner, a testimony cooed by the dove of the tongue from certainty upon its arak tree, saving its speaker from falling into the snares and traps of polytheism, and serving as a treasure for him when his stillness follows his movement. I bear witness that Muhammad is our master and His servant, whom God protected from error in speech and action, and by whom He guarded the pasture of eloquence—were it not for him, the grazing land would have mixed with the neglected—and gave him concise speech such that the eye of wish did not aspire to it, nor did the hand of hope covet it. May God’s blessings be upon him and his family and companions, whom the black snakes feared and the lions dreaded; their actions were homogeneous, for there was none among them but who would roam and be generous, govern and lead. Their characters were innocent of defects, so there was no arrogant, haughty, or envious one among them—a prayer revealed by the lip of dawn smiling in the dark lips of the night, and veiled by the light of the full moon at the wedding of perfection. \n\nAfter this: The book 'Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir' (The Current Proverb) by Al-Sahib Diya' al-Din ibn Athir al-Jazari—may God treat him with His kindness and forgive him for what the breezes of arrogance shook from the branch of his sympathy—is among the books whose leaves have fluttered in fame, and the pen strove in its service on its head as a servant strives on his leg. It became famous among the people of composition (Insha) as night is famous for concealment and day for revelation; nay, like the fame of the Banu Udhra in love for the burning of their entrails. The people of literature in the horizons became fond of it like the generous are fond of spending; nay, like the spies are fond of lovers. However, its author, may God have mercy on him, although he combined knowledge and action within it, and rhymed between the heavy and the ramal meters, and imagined that the full moon of his merit was complete and perfect, and imagined that the neck of composition after him was unadorned and his art obscure—he has removed his rare good deeds by the succession of his hasty bad deeds. He wasted those unique flowers in the wastelands of claims wherein the traveler finds no pleasure. The blackness of his night lingered over people after his crescent moon, and they rejected the sites of his dew because of the scum of his flood. Yes, for: 'The onyx is not worthy that a glance be repeated / upon it, nor that necks be turned towards it.' This is because he exhausted that expanse in self-admiration and flattery, and prolonged the belittling and disdain of his peers. He thought that God had forbidden eloquence to anyone coming after him, and that those before him were either a sheikh senile in his old age or a child playing in his cradle. He dragged the robe of pride and arrogance stitched with the needle of praise, and exaggerated in that like Abu Zubayd al-Ta'i's description of the lion. He described himself as Imru' al-Qais never described his horses, and praised it as Abu Nuwas never praised the dregs of his cup. He repeated this until souls were nauseated by that scum, and increased until anxiety mourned the garment of patience for what he lamented.\n\nThe Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Beware of three things: Greed, for it expelled Adam from Paradise; Pride, for it brought Iblis down from his rank; and Envy, for it called the son of Adam to kill his brother.' And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Envy consumes good deeds as fire consumes wood.' It is said: It is the first sin by which God was disobeyed in heaven and earth. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, narrating from God Almighty: 'Pride is My cloak, so whoever disputes with Me regarding it, I will enter him into the Fire.' Ja'far bin Muhammad said: 'God knew that sin is better for the believer than vanity (ujb); were it not for that, no believer would be tested with a sin.' Some wise men said: 'The affliction for which a person is not rewarded is vanity, and the blessing for which one is not envied is humility.' And it was said: 'Nothing hides virtues more than haughtiness and vanity.'\n\nThis is in addition to the many slips in the book, choices that are neither successful nor sound, the support of falsehood, the adornment of the idle, the preferring of what is weak and flimsy, and the weakening of what is established and concluded. 'Disadvantages, if divided among beautiful women / they would not have been dowered except with divorce.' I used to stand upon its ruins when reviewing it calling out, and stumble upon its tails when reading it often, and sigh at the isolation of those pearls in the string of jet, and find the blackness of its nights long while the morning of its beauties neither shone nor dawned. I heard what Izz al-Din ibn Abi al-Hadid, may God have mercy on him, wrote about the book by way of critique, and that those grievances cried out to him for refuge. But when I stood upon 'Al-Falak Al-Da'ir' (The Revolving Sphere - Ibn Abi al-Hadid's critique), I found he had neglected much, taking a little and leaving the significant. So I loved after that to pick up what he left behind, and track its anomalies and rarities.",

    "text": "'And I must perform my prayer after / it has passed, if I did not perform it in its time.' Although coming after Ibn Abi al-Hadid, I am like one who came after the sweeping of a flood, and became a gatherer of wood at night after the fruit-picker of the day. For this man has works that indicate his mastery and knowledge, the correctness of his aims when extending his reach, and his hydration from the arts and his undertaking and burden-bearing of them. Among them are two commentaries on 'Al-Muhassal' and 'Al-Mahsoul' by Imam Fakhr al-Din, and a third commentary on 'Al-Arba'in' by Fakhr al-Din. He versified 'Fasih Tha'lab' excellently in a day and a night, and this 'Al-Falak Al-Da'ir' he attached in thirteen days alongside the duties of his Diwan (office). His brother Muwaffaq al-Din ibn Abi al-Hadid wrote to him when he wrote 'Al-Falak Al-Da'ir': 'The Current Proverb (Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir), O my master / You have composed for it The Revolving Sphere (Al-Falak Al-Da'ir) / But this is a revolving sphere / In which you have become the current proverb.' He also wrote a commentary on 'Nahj al-Balagha' in sixteen volumes—and suffice it to say regarding one who addresses 'Nahj al-Balagha' and explains it, covering what relates to it from every science: principles (usul), jurisprudence (fiqh), Arabic language, history, biography of men, and other things. Whoever stands upon this explanation knows that few can enter that citadel with him or graze with him in such a pasture. It is enough that he critiqued Imam Fakhr al-Din and raised objections against him. I found verses by him beginning: 'By your right, if you entered me into the Fire I would say to / those in it, I was among those who loved Him / I spent my life in the intricacies of His sciences / and my desire was nothing but His satisfaction and nearness / Grant me a sinner whose ignorance ruined his forbearance / and whose sin destroyed him before creation / Does not the law of generosity require His pardon? / Is it proper that His passion and love be forgotten? / Did He not refute the deviation of Ibn al-Khatib and his doubt / and his falsification in religion when its matter became grave? / Did he not intend the truth in what he said? / Did not his books support Monotheism (Tawhid) and Justice (Adl)?'\n\nSo I said, responding to him in his meter and rhyme: 'We knew from this statement that you take / the view of Mu'tazilism, a matter grave in religion / You claim that God will not be seen in the Gathering / and that is a belief whose outcome will destroy you / You deny God's attributes, though they are eternal / and His books have affirmed them about your God / You believe the Quran is created and originated / and that is a disease whose cure is difficult among people / You affirm for the weak servant a will / by which that which his Lord did not decree comes to be / And things from these scandals are many / so which of you is the caller of misguidance and his party? / And who is the one who has become close to guidance / and protected the true religion with his defense? / Fakhr al-Din is not harmed by a statement you composed / containing excessive ugliness as you insult him / He was possessor of a light leading to guidance / when the meteors of his doubts rose in the darkness / If you gave the right of yourself its due / you would have extinguished an ember you kindle with impossibility / You are not among his peers on the day of battle / nor do you ever have a resemblance to the Imam.'\n\nI copied from the handwriting of Hafiz al-Yaghmuri, who said: Imam Rukn al-Din Abu al-Qasim recited to me verses of his own regarding Izz al-Din ibn Abi al-Hadid when he wrote 'Al-Falak Al-Da'ir' against 'Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir': 'He brought something cold and heavy / and did not inherit that from afar / He is, as you have known, a thing / the most famous of which was in iron (Hadid).' He also wrote a book refuting Ibn Abi al-Hadid and named it: 'Nashr al-Mathal al-Sa'ir wa Tayy al-Falak al-Da'ir' (Unfolding the Current Proverb and Folding the Revolving Sphere). I say: This Rukn al-Din Abu al-Qasim is Mahmud ibn al-Hussein ibn Imam Arshad al-Din, originally from Isfahan, born in Sinjar. He was a Hanafi who knew the school of thought, the two principles (usul), disagreement (khilaf), and literature. He read under Saif al-Amidi and Diya' al-Din ibn al-Athir. He abandoned the rag of the jurists and dressed in the attire of soldiers. He died in Damascus on the 6th of Ramadan, 650 AH, and was buried at the foot of Mount Qasioun. He was born in 592 AH. Regarding his transition to the military, he said verses including: 'Look, O brother of reason, at a profession / from which we fled to the clamor of war / If it were not the most unlucky thing in creation / we would not have been satisfied with swift death instead of it.' I was, at a time when I wrote about 'Al-Muhassal' by Imam Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, composed verses appropriate to mention here, which are: 'The science of Usul is victorious through Fakhr al-Din / by him we attack with wonder and miracle.'",

    "text": "'By him, the bright Sunnah became clear / established for the resident and the passerby / He has researches, how many doubts have they burned / with their meteors, so who is the critic of Al-Razi!' Our Sheikh, the Imam and Hafiz Athir al-Din Abu Hayyan Muhammad ibn Yusuf recited to me from his own words in the Egyptian lands in the year 728 AH, saying: Our Sheikh, the genealogist and Hafiz of the East and West, Sharaf al-Din Abu Muhammad Abd al-Mu'min ibn Khalaf ibn Abi al-Hasan al-Dimyati recited to us on Wednesday, the 15th of Jumada al-Akhira, 680 AH in Cairo, while I read to him, saying: The Sheikh, the Scholar, the Sahib Izz al-Din Abu Hamid Abd al-Hamid ibn Hibat Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Hussein ibn Abi al-Hadid the Mu'tazilite recited to us in Baghdad—his birth was in Al-Mada'in at the beginning of Dhu al-Hijjah 586 AH—of his own poetry: 'Were it not for three things, I would not fear my demise / they are not as the young man of Al-Abd (Tarafa) said / That I support Tawhid and Justice in / every place, exerting my effort / And that I converse with God, enjoying / a solitude sweeter than honey / And that I walk through time with pride against / every mean person, turning my cheek in disdain / For that reason, I desire neither a young girl / nor wine, nor one of youthful bosom.' Ibn Abi al-Hadid's saying here: 'Were it not for three...' is a reference to the saying of Tarafa bin al-Abd: 'Were it not for three things which are the pleasure of a youth / by your grandfather, I would not care when my visitors rose / Among them is my outstripping the scolding women with a drink / of dark wine which, when mixed with water, foams / And my charging, when the distressed calls out, leaning / like the wolf of the thicket, whom I alerted, coming to water / And shortening the cloudy day, and the cloudy day is delightful / with a buxom woman under the pole-supported tent.'\n\nFrom the poetry of Ibn Abi al-Hadid is a poem ending in 'B' (Ba'iyya) among his praises for Ali bin Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him: 'Verily, the path of glory is clearly marked / though it has many paths and is dreaded / It is the refined honey gathered by a man / who sought it, while the tips of spears are the queen bees / Taste death if you wish for highness, and feed on destruction / for the attainment of wishes is earned by death / Wade through death, you will be safe from the plan of humiliation, for / the blaze of the matter reveals itself while the matter is ignited / Did the news not inform about the conquest of Khaybar / for in it are wonders for the one of intellect who responds / And the victory of Ali in highness is its victory through him / for each is added and attributed to the other / Fortresses guarding the gap where they displayed themselves / and not every mountable beast is ridden / Necklaces of stars are hung upon them / and showers of clouds fall below them.' From it: 'And a reckless army, waving the rein, he scatters it / so neither dragging of a train nor breastplate availed it / For the matter has distractors regarding it and changes / just as there was a turning away regarding it for calamities.' From it: 'A day of swords in the darkness of a dusty night / so there is a bright white and a pitch black / Joshua mourns over them with the wailing of Qarun / and Jacob sheds the tears of Joseph over them / In it are thunderbolts from the roaring of men / and downpours from the pouring of surging blood.' From it: 'His sword and spear eject death / and his scabbard and the spear-shafts kindle fire.'\n\nAnd among his praises for Ali bin Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, is a poem beginning: 'The toothpick talks about her saliva / fragrantly, so did the Arak tree see you? / And for her glance, the coward acts feminine, but if she gazes / with a look, she is the lethal lion / Nets of hearts, and I did not think before her / that hearts are hunted by traps.' From it: 'O she whose polished face is the water of his youth / what is death were it not for your lethal glance? / Or did the story of her standing in the forenoon reach you / while our hearts were pierced by the tips of separation? / Nothing is sharper than the separation of loved ones or / the sword of the Wasi (Successor - Ali), both are shedders of blood.'",

    "text": "These two poems are long; I abbreviated what I abbreviated from them, and limited myself to what I limited myself to, seeking to indicate his merit, and the sharpness of his spearhead and blade. But his abundant materials led him to withdraw (to Mu'tazilism) and become a Shi'a, and he neglected the side of the Sunnah and wasted it. He has prose in which he excelled with some of his quality, but it was not like his poetry which raised his hill and consolidated his mountain. He cited some of it in 'Al-Falak Al-Da'ir', but the prose of Ibn al-Athir is more grounded than his in the view of those with insight; had he deleted it, it would have been better than affirming it, and more protective for him against the testing of his arrow and the pressing of his spear. So with what feathers can one coming after this speaker rise? And what sword can cut like his cutting when it is notched? The Mu'tazila are knights of research, and among those for whom determination for debate is abundant and motives and incentives obey it. But: 'A young man may attain glory while his clothing / is worn out and the pocket of his shirt is patched.' The first left for the last more than what he brought, and minds varied in criticizing the wild cows of beauty and its buxom maidens, and the cloud of intellect followed when it cleared with the downpour of its clouds. 'The mother of generosity did not become barren after Hatim / she has a newborn every day among creation.'\n\nI have collected what I stumbled upon of Ibn al-Athir's slips in these papers, and pitched this tent over them and extended these curtains. I listed them in order, and drove them according to that arrangement. I named it 'Nasrat al-Thaa'ir 'ala al-Mathal al-Sa'ir' (Aid/Victory of the Avenger against the Current Proverb). I chose this name for it as a sign and a signal, because the 'Thaa'ir' (Avenger) in language is the one who does not spare anything until he takes his revenge. And if I discuss with him a research he presented, or compete with him in a good thing he spoiled, I hardly leave that place empty of the beauties of the masters of this art whom he criticized, and whose stations of blame he frequented and visited. Especially Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God Almighty have mercy on him. For he opposed him in some of what he composed, and criticized what he adorned and embellished. 'Suha said to the sun: You are hidden / And the darkness said: O morning, your color is changing.' The sword is famous without a baldric, and the morning is witnessed without evidence. And where are the intents of Al-Fadil and the distance of his aim, and his snatching of meanings with the subtlety of his intent and the hidden nature of his path? Far from it, for between them is the difference between the humiliation of the foot and the glory of the parting of the hair. The subtlety of that is not hidden from the taste of the skilled writer, and the beauty of his meanings inwardly is double his words outwardly. How excellent is Ibn Sana' al-Mulk when he says, although most of his Diwan is about him: 'The perfect ones bore witness of merit to Al-Fadil / or the newborn almost bore witness / Time promised to be generous to creation / but with his like, it does not be generous.' And Ibn Qalaqis when he says also about him among verses: 'He intoxicated us with a statement that lasted until / we wondered how he warned us against wine / Meanings that eloquent ones sit back from / and their thoughts hear them standing / Orphans that give charity in his highness / the saying of one who called him the Father of Orphans.' As for Ibn al-Sa'ati, he praised him frequently. Of that: 'There is none who compares a creature to his likeness / except like one who compared the lowlands to the peaks / If he advances in highness boasting / Simak (Arcturus) knows his place and steps back.' People addressed Ibn al-Athir because he was a contradictor of Al-Fadil, and he was shot by their tongues and pens with the slashing of debate swords and the shooting of struggle arrows. 'So do not panic at a sunnah (way) you walked / for the first to accept a sunnah is the one who walks it.' This is not the place to praise Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, and you will stand upon it, and the whiffs of his perfume will guide you when you reach him. From here, I strip the forearm of critique, and sharpen the arrows that I think are penetrating the target. And upon God is the intent of the path; He is my sufficiency and the best disposer of affairs.\n\n**Starting with the Hamdala (Praise of God)**\nIbn al-Athir, may God forgive him, said: 'We ask God to make us reach of praise what He is worthy of, and to teach us of expression (Bayan) that which the merit of speech and its virtue fall short of, and the wisdom of address and its decision.'",

    "text": "I say: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Every speech that does not begin with the praise of God (Hamd) is cut off (ajdham).' If he had said: 'Al-Hamdu lillah' (Praise be to God), it would have been better. Perhaps Al-Zamakhshari was criticized for this at the beginning of 'Al-Mufassal' for saying: 'Allah I praise' (Allaha Ahmad), and Al-Hariri for saying: 'O God, we praise You' (Allahumma inna nahmaduk), because they did not open their speech with 'Al-Hamd'. It is most appropriate to adopt what came from God Almighty, for there is no station for the servant more noble than prayer because it is worship. Even the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'The closest a servant is to his Lord is when he is prostrating.' Al-Fatiha, which is the Mother of the Book and the pillar in prayer, opened with 'In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds.' Sahl bin Harun said: 'It is a right upon every person with a statement to begin it with the praise of God before opening it, just as grace began before entitlement.' Ibn al-Athir, may God Almighty have mercy on him, used that in the signing of his books, saying: 'Every speech that does not begin with the praise of God is cut off.' Ibn Abi al-Hadid raised an objection against Ibn al-Athir regarding this rhymed prose (saj') which is sufficient, so let that be taken from 'Al-Falak Al-Da'ir'.\n\nAs for the second rhyme, I do not know the meaning of his saying 'that which the merit of speech falls short of.' What is it that He teaches him such that the merit of speech falls short of it? If he meant by that the subtlety of meanings which are the souls of words, then when has speech fallen short of a meaning that the soul did not bring forth completely? And if he meant by that the things that are upon the structures of words regarding beauty and splendor, that is other than 'Bayan' (expression/clarification), because Bayan is the clarification of meanings and their display and manifestation. That which you intended of beauty and subtlety which exist in some speech, that is other than Bayan. It is like charm (malaha) for which no meaning is understood nor expressed. As it was said: 'A thing by which creation is tempted, other than what / is called beauty, and I do not know what it is.' And it is said: 'With the beloved is something else other than his beauty which intercedes for him to hearts.' Do you not see that some forms, whose individual limbs are the ultimate in beauty, do not have that meaning which belongs to others? Likewise, it was said about the antidote (tiryaq), that after composition God pours upon it a property that was not in the power of its parts in the state of singularity. The collective form has a meaning other than the state that belongs to its individuals. There is no doubt that the speech of the eloquent in the state of composition has properties for which that beauty found in it cannot be expressed. Therefore, jurists gave a fatwa regarding one who changes the order of Al-Fatiha, and flips some verses to the place of others, that his prayer is not valid, because he invalidates the miracle of the Great Quran, which is its context on this strange pattern, and its composition on this wondrous system. Here is a research between the Ash'ari and the Mu'tazili which I skipped seeking brevity. If Ibn al-Athir asked for this special property, then this special property is not called 'Bayan'. And if the matter is so, it is proven that the meaning of this rhyme is not understood. Ibn Abi al-Hadid discussed with him his saying 'speech' (Nutq) and what he intended by it, so let it be taken from his book.\n\nHe said: 'And upon his family and companions, among whom are those who preceded and hastened, and among whom are those who persevered and were patient, and among whom are those who sheltered and supported.' I say: If he had said: 'And among whom are those who emigrated (hajar) and supported (nasar)', it would have been better from two aspects: First, he would achieve balance and inlaying (tarsi') between 'hajar' (emigrated) and 'sabar' (was patient/persevered) [Note: likely referring to rhyming with 'nasar']. Second, it would cover the Muhajirun and Ansar from the Companions, may God be pleased with them, for they are prioritized over the Ansar, and in his saying there is no mention of the Muhajirun, for among the Ansar are those who preceded others to faith. If it is said: His saying 'sabar' (was patient) and 'sabara' (persevered) have the same meaning, I say: Follow the wording of the Quran in His Almighty's saying: 'O you who have believed, be patient and persevere (sabiru wa sabiru).' For patience (sabr) is other than perseverance (musabara), because musabara is a mutual action, which is meeting the action of the other with the like. It is as if that is an increase over the patience that a human can bear.\n\n**Al-Hariri's inability to compose what was asked of him in the Diwan**\nHe said: He mentioned Al-Hariri of the Maqamat, may God Almighty have mercy on him, and that such a book issued from him, but when he was asked to write in the Diwan (official correspondence office), he was silenced. He cited the famous story. Then he said: 'This is something to wonder at, and I was asked about this so I said: No wonder, because the Maqamat all revolve around a story that exits to a conclusion, but correspondence (mukatabat) is a sea with no shore, because meanings in it renew with the renewal of the accidents of days, and they are renewing by the number of breaths. Do you not see that if an eloquent writer writes about a vast state whose sultan has a famous sword and mentioned endeavor, and stays on that for a short period not reaching ten years, he records from correspondence what exceeds ten parts, each part of which is larger than the Maqamat in volume, then if sifted, half of it comes out pure.'",

    "text": "I say: As for people's wonder at the incident of Al-Hariri, it is a place of wonder at first glance. Because for someone from whom issued such a book which has no peer in its field—and in literature it is: 'The sun of its forenoon, the crescent of its night / the pearls of its necklaces, the chrysolite of its jewelry'—to then pause at a letter requested from him, that is strange. But if a human thinks, and knows that composition (Insha) is a matter of openings (futuh) upon a human, it would not be strange. For God Almighty may open with that at a time and not another. Sheikh Muhyiddin ibn Arabi counted poetry and good writing among the 'openings' (futuh), and people remain so, sometimes it opens for them and sometimes it does not open. Al-Hariri at that time was not opened upon. Furthermore, Al-Hariri at the time of making the Maqamat was in his house, alone with himself, molding, breaking, demolishing, and building; if a station repelled him he turned to another, and if a meaning held back from him he left it and pulled what was smoother in leadership than it. It was mentioned that the drafts of the Maqamat were a camel's load. That is a matter different from his sitting in the Diwan and his first arrival, while he is among a group of masters of the art, and a meaning is proposed to him from which he has no escape, nor room in its narrowness, nor salvation from its slip, and he had not prepared for it; inevitably he was silenced, paused, and plucked his beard. 'A man is not blamed for the cowardice of his day / if his bravery was known yesterday.' Perhaps Ibn al-Athir forgave him in what he cited of his words in 'Al-Mathal' and 'Al-Washy Al-Marqum' and 'Al-Ma'ani Al-Mubtada'a' and other attributions of the Maqamat. For he narrated about himself in 'Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir' that he used to recite the Great Quran, and if a noble verse passed him and he glimpsed a meaning in it suitable to be in such-and-such, he built a book or a chapter upon it and established it. Or as he said. And most of what he established is but oppositions by which he opposed the books of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil and Abu Ishaq al-Sabi, and this is of the nature of making Maqamat while he is in his house reviewing what he makes, reflecting, erasing, and establishing. 'They imagined play to be war, and stabbing in the / battle to be other than stabbing in the hippodrome.'\n\nAs for his saying: That the writer produces in the period he mentioned ten parts, each part larger in volume than the Maqamat, and if sifted and revised they would be five, this is partisanship and a claim upon which no proof stands, or ignorance reaching the limit. What correspondence of a writer whose era preceded and until now has had a single volume collected for him like the Maqamat, circulated by people, drinking its cups, quoting its verses and rhymes, repeating it from its beginning to its end, searching for its defects, and digging for its evils, yet finding no flaw in it, nor locating a point of attack? Rather, it clarifies upon smelting, and improves upon usage. 'The passing of nights increases it in newness / and the aging of days in beauty of youth.' Although Ibn al-Khashab replied to it regarding slight words, and Al-Mas'udi answered him about them, Ibn al-Khashab was correct in the little of the little, and obstinate in much of the little. Similarly, Ibn Barri placed slight notes upon it. Suffice it for you a book that became famous, became a proverb, became one of the supports (athafi) in the science of literature, its words and meanings became proof, and copies were transferred by the number of its letters. 'It traveled the path of the sun in every place / and blew the blowing of the wind in land and sea.' I have not seen nor heard of anyone who took a part of correspondence, read it to a sheikh, memorized it, sought narration by it, and attached comments of language, parsing, and meanings to it. People have written extensive commentaries on the Maqamat, like Al-Mas'udi who has two commentaries on them, Al-Mutarriz, Ibn al-Anbari, Abu al-Baqa, and others. I have even seen some claim they are symbols in alchemy, and it is told that the Franks read them to their kings in their language, illustrate them, and narrate their stories to one another. This is only because this book, one of its manifestations is those funny stories and incidents which, if a human starts to stand upon them, his soul aspires to what they end in, and yearns to know the end of that story. This is in addition to the wisdom and proverbs contained therein which resemble the book Kalila wa Dimna, and the types of literature and its various arts and diverse styles. Sheikh Fath al-Din Muhammad ibn Sayyid al-Nas told me on the authority of his father Abu Amr on the authority of his father Abu Bakr, saying: We said to Ibn Amira, the writer of Andalusia: Why do you not make something like the Maqamat? He said: As for the words, I am not overcome regarding them, but those lies which he tells, I do not know how to put the like of them.",

    "text": "I heard Judge Shihab al-Din Mahmud, may God Almighty have mercy on him, while this book was being read to him, narrating that Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God Almighty have mercy on him, wanted to oppose them (the Maqamat), and he composed thirteen maqamat opposing each chapter with its like until he came to Al-Hariri's saying in the fourteenth Maqamah: 'Know, O refuge of the hopeful and support of the widows, that I am from the elites of the tribes, and the noble ladies. My family and my husband ceased not to occupy the chest (front), and march in the heart (center), and mount the back (beasts), and bestow the hand (generosity). But when time destroyed the upper arms (helpers), and bereaved the bodies of the limbs, and the back of the belly was overturned, the onlooker turned away, the eyebrow was harsh, the eye went (blind/lost), the palm was lost (poverty), the fire-stick failed to spark, the right hand weakened, and the elbows were separated, and there remained for us neither a central incisor nor a canine. Since the green life turned dusty, and the yellow beloved (gold) turned away, my white day turned black, and my black hair turned white, until the blue enemy pitied me, so welcome to the red death.' Al-Fadil said: From where does a human bring a chapter to oppose this? Then he cut what he had done of the Maqamat and it did not appear. Or as he said. Suffice it for you that someone like Al-Qadi Al-Fadil says such a thing about him, and confesses inability to him. As for me, whenever I read this chapter and mention it, I find a euphoria like the euphoria of wine, and a joy—no joy of the night traveler at the appearance of the morning. In what correspondence do you find the peer of this chapter which has this lightness and grace, and rhymes did not disturb it? The Maqamat have been wronged by whoever placed them in the category of correspondence; correspondence is a part of them. Rather, it is a book of knowledge in its field, and the rhetoric of the man is known from his mentioning of a thing in most of his Maqamat with praise and blame. This is rhetoric: that you describe a thing then blame it, or blame it then praise it, as he did in the Maqamah of the Dinar, and the one in which he differentiated between the writing of composition and calculation, and the one in which he mentioned the virgin and the matron, marriage and celibacy, and other things. His eloquence is known from his taking current proverbs and joining them to a rhyme better than them. Like his saying: 'You gave the bow to its shaper and settled the house with its builder.' And his saying: 'She escaped, a shell from a chick, and became innocent as the wolf was innocent of the blood of Jacob's son.' And his saying: 'Was our promise lost like the promise of Urqub, or did a need remain in the soul of Jacob?' And: 'When his ray indicated his sun, and his address betrayed the secret of his scroll.' And: 'So I remained more confused than a lizard and more stunned than a lover.' And: 'Thinner than a pen and drier than a stone.' And: 'If there was a strap in my stick and a rain in my cloud.' And: 'I folded it on its fold, and protected its mouth from its cold.' And: 'You are the two Farqad stars of a sky and like two fire-sticks in a container.' And his saying: 'So that it be known that his wind met a tornado and his stream encountered a torrent.' And: 'A desire with no welcome and a drink that has no sweetness left for me.' And: 'Ability is the visit of a phantom, and opportunity is a summer cloud.' And: 'Farther than returning yesterday that has passed, and the dead that is gone.' And: 'How long is your rope and how terrible is your trick.' And: 'It was a day longer than the shadow of a spear, and hotter than the tear of a bereft mother.' And: 'So he began to sting and shout, and behave impudently and not feel shy.' And: 'Where is the crawling place of your youth (boyhood), and from where is the blowing place of your east wind?' And: 'I found so I envied, and found noble so I bound.' And: 'Not gone from your wealth is what admonished you, nor committed a crime against you he who awakened you.' And: 'You hovered over a tearful well, and exposed yourself to an empty cell.' And: 'Not every black woman is a date, nor every red one wine.' And: 'Like one who seeks the eggs of the Anuq bird, and seeks flight from she-camels.' And: 'Do you teach your mother copulation and your wet nurse breastfeeding?' And: 'When we saw their fire was a glow-worm, and their news was like the mirage of wastelands.' And: 'I am more obedient than your shoes, and more agreeable than your nourishment.' There is much of this type in it which I skipped for fear of elongation. 'I did not reach the limit in broadcasting his beauties / except that what I leave is more than what I said.'\n\n**The Culture of the Writer**\nHe said: If God installs in a human a nature capable of this, he requires eight types of tools, then he listed them.",

    "text": "I say: The writer needs to memorize the Dear Book (Quran) and persist in reciting it, so that it circulates on his tongue, runs in his thought, represented before the eyes of his memory so he may spend from its abundance. And [he needs] knowledge of language and grammar and persistence in parsing (I'rab) night and day, until that becomes a good faculty for him. And morphology, meanings (Ma'ani), expression (Bayan), embellishment (Badi'), prosody, rhyme, and royal rulings as he mentioned in his book. And some exegesis (Tafsir), and some Hadiths like the book 'Al-Shihab' or 'Al-Najm' by Al-Aqlishi, and the traditions transmitted from the Companions, may God be pleased with them, and what passed between the Rightly Guided Caliphs and their governors, and what passed between Ali and Muawiyah, may God be pleased with them both, of dialogues. And the signatures (tawaqi') of Caliphs, Viziers, and Writers, and Arab proverbs. And memorizing a good portion of Arab poetry, the Mukhadramin, the Moderns (Muwalladin), and the stallions of the latecomers. And memorizing well 'Al-Hamasa' and selections of 'Al-Mufaddaliyat', and some poems of 'Muntaha al-Talab' collected by Ibn Maimun. And what is possible of history, biography of men, and calculation. And reviewing the mother books of literature, such as 'Al-Aghani', 'Al-Iqd', 'Al-Bayan wa al-Tabyin', 'Al-Dhakhira', 'Zahr al-Adab', 'Amali al-Qali', 'Al-Kamil' by Al-Mubarrad, and 'Tadhkirat Ibn Hamdun'. And memorizing a good portion of the Maqamat and the Nubatian Sermons (Khutab al-Nubatiyya), and some poetry of Al-Mutanabbi, Abu Tammam, Al-Buhturi, 'Saqt al-Zand' and others. I have selected from the poetry of these four poets in a small volume. And standing upon the correspondence of writers and observing what they intended in every art: of congratulations, condolences, conquests, testaments, their traditions, signatures, commands, and prohibitions therein, and the openings of their supplications in all the branching paths of writing, and the method of beginnings and replies in gifts, intercessions, descriptions, letters of brethren, and what follows this course. This is a door whose shutter is not closed, and consensus is not tied upon its limitation. In summary, the writer needs everything; were it not that verifying every art is not binding on him, I would have said he is the one who knows existence as it is. But far from it. Yes, people vary in that and they are on levels: some have climbed the degrees, and some have not risen from the depths, and what is between that. Participation is necessary whenever possible, even if it is knowledge of the terminology of every art owner. If he completes his materials or approaches completion, then knowing the terminology of the Diwan in correspondence regarding titles, attributes, and what follows this course. For knowing this with practice, he conceptualizes and knows it in less than a week, and it is something whose rule is not established, because it differs with the difference of every time and its people. This is of no account, for it is the easiest thing he knows.\n\n**Does violating grammar harm the meaning?**\nHe said, mentioning grammar: If we look at its types and divisions, we find most of it is not needed for understanding meanings. Do you not see that if you ordered a man to stand and said: 'Qawm' (Stand!) confirming the Waw and not making it jussive (omitting the middle vowel), nothing of the understanding of that would be disturbed. Similarly, the conditional and all adjuncts follow this course, like the circumstantial accusative (Hal), specification (Tamyiz), and exception. He cited things of these types.\n\nI say: Only common people, those not clothed in knowledge, and those who have not smelled the scent of science would bring up such a thing. Does he not know that if a letter issues from a correspondent who does not make his imperative verbs jussive, nor his conditions and their answers, and does not put his subject in the nominative and his adjuncts in the accusative, nor observes any of his grammar rules which are apparent, nor maintains anything of parsing (I'rab) at all, it would be a laughingstock for the simple-minded, let alone the wise? In that case, scholars and ignoramuses would be equal. Umar, may God be pleased with him, wrote to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari: 'After this, understand the Sunnah and learn Arabic.' Abdullah bin Umar, may God be pleased with them both, used to beat his child for solecism (Lah'n). Abdul Malik said: 'Solecism in speech is uglier than the marks of smallpox on the face.' Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali saw sacks of merchants written upon them 'Li-Abu Fulan' (For Abu So-and-so - grammatical error). He said: 'Glory be to God, they commit solecism and profit.' It is said: 'Whoever loves to find pride in himself, let him learn Arabic.' Does he not know that some have deduced that Grammar is a communal obligation (Fard Kifaya), if not said to be an individual obligation, and some went so far as to say God does not accept supplication if it is not parsed correctly? Sheikh Taqi al-Din ibn al-Salah said: 'I fear for the one who engages in Hadith and does not know Grammar, that he enters into his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: Whoever lies about me intentionally, let him take his seat in the Fire.' Then he excepted things from that which are not known except by parsing. So I say: One cannot reach the knowledge of the obscure except after knowing the clear, and whoever does not know the evident will not know the intricate, to move in understanding from the lower to the higher.",

    "text": "Al-Khalil bin Ahmad, may God have mercy on him, said: 'No one reaches from Grammar what he needs except by learning what he does not need.' Abu Amr said: 'If what is needed cannot be reached except by what is not needed, then what is not needed has become needed.' Every science is of this status; it contains the clear and the obscure. In Jurisprudence (Fiqh), its obscure issues in menstruation, dry ablution (Tayammum), inheritance shares, and what is in algebra and comparison, and circular reasoning issues in divorce and other things. And as in Logic, its obscurities in syllogisms, mixed modalities, and fallacies and other things. And as in Theology (Kalam) regarding confirming the indivisible atom (Jawhar Fard), and that an accident ('arad) does not remain for two moments, and that the non-existent is not a thing. A human does not reach the knowledge of these intricate issues except after premises he understands from the clear issues. I have not seen anyone bring up such a thing except the common people, or one who is ignorant of this art.\n\n**Does Solecism (Lah'n) detract from the beauty of speech?**\nHe said, after citing some poetry of Abu Nuwas, Abu Tammam, and Abu al-Tayyib and their solecisms: 'Solecism was not a detractor from the beauty of speech.'\nI say: Nothing remains after this but for him to say: 'Observance of parsing (I'rab) is a cause necessitating the ugliness of speech.' Does he not see that he did not hear their saying: 'Grammar in speech is like salt in food.' Some have gone to say that 'I'rab' (parsing/making clear) was named I'rab because the Arabs in His Almighty's saying: 'Uruban atraba' (loving, equal in age) are those who endear themselves to their husbands, so it is as if the one who parses his speech endears himself to his addressee. I say: The meaning of his endearing is that he mentions signs indicating his meanings. For if he wants to express wonder, he says: 'Ma ahsana Zaydan' (How beautiful Zayd is!), and if he left parsing and said: 'Ma ahsan Zayd' silencing the Nun and Dal, understanding would be confused for the addressee and he would remain in bewilderment: Is he asking, wondering, or informing? When he put the Nun in the accusative (fatha) and the Dal [of Ahsan], it was known he is wondering. If he said: 'Ma ahsanu Zaydin' raising the Nun (damma) and genitizing the Dal (kasra), it was known he is asking. And if he said 'Ma ahsana Zaydu' putting Nun in accusative and raising Dal, it was known he is informing by negating charity from him. When the speaker relieves the one he addresses from thought and bewilderment by parsing, he has endeared himself to him. And it has been said... 'There is no worth for the solecist even if his crown reached the clouds of the sky.' As for me, I do not deny that the subtlety of composition and ease of speech is another matter beyond Grammar. This is known, but the dispute is in his arbitrariness and obstinacy.\n\n**Regarding the color of the Cow in the Verse: 'Yellow, bright in color'**\nHe said: Some jurists negotiated with me regarding His Almighty's saying in Surat Al-Baqarah: 'Yellow, bright in its color' (Safra'u faqi'un lawnuha), that the color of the cow was black. He began to criticize that and argue that the color is yellow. I say: It is known that the more likely view is that the color was yellow, because it is emphasized by 'faqi' (bright/intense). Just as black is emphasized by 'halik' and 'hanik', white by 'yaqiq' and 'lahiq', red by 'qani' and 'dharihi', green by 'nadir' and 'midham', yellow by 'nasi' and 'faqi' and 'waris', blue by 'khutbani', and ash-grey by 'radhani'. However, if exegesis arrives and transmission is established regarding something, it is not possible other than accepting it and acting by it in its place without exceeding that place with it. This is if it opposes a rule; if it can be preferred, it is preferred, just as some preferred this by His Almighty's saying: 'It throws sparks like the huge castle, as if they were yellow camels (jamalat sufr).' Meaning black camels tending towards yellowness. They said: And fire is black and dark.\n\n**Etiquette in speaking about the Greats**\nHe said when mentioning the incidents of the Arabs: And among that is what was reported about Umar bin Al-Khattab, that he summoned Abu Musa al-Ash'ari and those under him of governors. Among them was Al-Rabi' bin Ziyad al-Harithi. He went to Yarfa', the freedman of Umar, and asked him what promotes one with him and sells well to him. He indicated roughness of living. So he went and wore a wool cloak and a dark turban and double-layered boots and attended before him among the governors. Umar looked him up and down, and his gaze fell only on him. He brought him close and asked about his condition, then advised Abu Musa al-Ash'ari regarding him. Then Ibn al-Athir said: 'I have used this in an investiture (taqlid) for some kings from the Diwan of the Caliphate, so I said: And if you seek help in your work from anyone, then set up observations upon him, and do not be satisfied with what you knew of the beginning of his condition, for conditions change like the changing of bodies. And beware of being deceived by the righteousness of the appearance as Umar bin Al-Khattab was deceived by Al-Rabi' bin Ziyad.'",

    "text": "I say: His saying 'as Umar was deceived' contains bad etiquette towards Umar, may God be pleased with him, by attributing deception to him. In this, there is a doubt for the owner of the investiture, for he will say to himself: 'If someone like Umar was deceived, what is my thought of myself?' so negligence will occur from him. Politeness in such a case is better, and pushing deception away from him is more appropriate. Do you not see His Almighty's saying narrating from Joseph, peace be upon him: 'After Satan induced dissension between me and my brothers,' attributing what happened between them to Satan out of politeness towards his brothers, peace be upon them. If someone like Umar bin Al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, was deceived despite his caution and strictness in religion, what is thought of others? Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba said: 'I have not seen anyone more resolute than Umar. By God, he had merit that prevented him from panicking, and intellect that prevented him from being deceived.' Abu Bakr al-Khara'iti said: 'May God have mercy on Umar, how insightful he was by the light of God regarding God, and how physiognomic. By God, he was as the poet said: Insightful into the consequences of matters by his opinion / as if he has in today an eye towards tomorrow.' It is reported about Abu al-Abbas Ahmad bin Abdullah bin al-Hutay'ah that he used to say: 'The happiness of Islam was folded in the shroud of Umar bin Al-Khattab.' How excellent is the poet's saying: 'My arguments against you when alone are many / but when present, I am defeated / I cannot say you wronged me / God knows that I am wronged.' Look at the politeness of this poet and his kindness with his beloved and his reverence for him. It would have been better if he had said: 'And if you seek help in your work from anyone, do not trust from him the shine of a mirage, and uncover with the hand of your observation the veil of his biography, and be alert to his affairs, so do not be satisfied with the populated exterior and forget the ruined interior, and imagine from his cunning what Al-Rabi' bin Ziyad used as a ruse against Umar bin Al-Khattab.' For attributing the ruse to Al-Rabi' is better in etiquette than attributing deception to Umar, may God be pleased with him.\n\n**Denial of taking the title 'Al-Nasir' for Sultan Saladin**\nHe said: I found a letter by Ibn Ziyadah al-Baghdadi written to King Al-Nasir Saladin including matters disapproved of him by the Diwan of the Caliphate. Among them is that he took the title 'Al-Nasir' (The Victor/Helper), and that is the title of the Commander of the Faithful. Then Ibn al-Athir assessed the letter and said: 'I did not find a defect in it except in this chapter which contains the discussion of the title, for he did not bring speech fitting the rest of the mentioned chapters, but brought speech containing badness, like his saying: What the master deems good is forbidden for the slave, and things of this pattern.' Then Ibn al-Athir, may God have mercy on him, mentioned what he composed regarding this meaning for himself, saying: 'It is known that Prophets and Caliphs have characteristics they are exclusive to by rule of singularity, and no one of the people has the right to share with them in it the sharing of peers. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, conducted that in things he stipulated by his ruling, among them that he forbade others to combine his Kunya and his Name, and this is a justification for the Commander of the Faithful to be exclusive in a matter by which he is famous and for others forbidden.' He cited the rest of the rhyme, and there is no cream in it, so I established it.\n\nI say: Before wading in with him, I present the difference between the Name (Ism), the Kunya, and the Title (Laqab). That is, the proper noun indicating a specific person, if it begins with 'Abu' like Abu Bakr and Abu Hafs, or with 'Umm' like Umm Kulthum, Umm al-Banin, and Umm al-Mu'minin, it is the Kunya. If it implies elevation of the named one like Ma' al-Sama' (Water of the Sky), Dhu Ru'ayn, Dhu al-Nurayn, Dhat al-Nitaqayn, and Dhu al-Janahayn—and included in this are the titles of the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphs like Al-Hadi, Al-Mahdi, Al-Rashid, Al-Amin, and Al-Ma'mun, and included is the terminology of people like Shams al-Din, Badr al-Din, Najm al-Din and other titles of the People of the Book like Shams al-Dawla and Taj al-Mulk—or implies lowliness of the named one like Quffa, Batta, Al-Uqayshir, and Al-Ahwas, then this is the Title (Laqab). If it is for indication of the essence of the named one and his specification, like Zayd, Amr, Bakr, and Khalid, this is the Name (Ism). Once this is established, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Do not combine my name and my kunya.' His meaning is that no one of his nation should be called Muhammad Abu al-Qasim. As for Al-Nasir, Al-Adid, Al-Qadir, Al-Mustansir and the like, this is neither a kunya nor a name according to what is established. Furthermore, jurists differed on using the kunya Abu al-Qasim on three schools of thought: Al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, and those who agreed with him held that it is not lawful for anyone to use it as a kunya whether his name is Muhammad or otherwise. Malik, may God have mercy on him, held that it is permissible to use it as a kunya for one whose name is Muhammad and for others. Some held that it is permissible for one whose name is not Muhammad and not permissible for one whose name is Muhammad. Al-Rafi'i said: 'This third view seems to be more correct, because people have not ceased using it as a kunya in all ages without denial.'",

As for the consensus of people on doing it, while among those using it as a kunya are prominent Imams and people of influence (Ahl al-Hall wa al-Aqd) who are followed in religion, this contains strengthening for Malik's school, may God have mercy on him, regarding its absolute permissibility. They would have understood the prohibition as specific to his lifetime, peace and blessings be upon him, due to the famous reason for the prohibition regarding the Jews using the kunya Abu al-Qasim and calling out 'O Abu al-Qasim' seeking to annoy. This meaning has ceased.' End quote. I say: Among those who used the kunya Abu al-Qasim is Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. It is said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Ali, may God be pleased with him: 'A boy will be born to you after me, and I have gifted him my name and my kunya, and it is not lawful for anyone after him.' And Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Muhammad ibn Talha, Muhammad ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, Muhammad ibn Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad ibn Hatib ibn Abi Balta'a, and Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath ibn Qays. I heard about the specific properties of the Prophets: As for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, his specific properties are known in Sharia. Among them: the obligation of Duha prayer, sacrifice (Udhiya), Witr, Tahajjud, Siwak, giving the wife choice to stay or separate, the prohibition of writing and poetry, keeping a wife who dislikes him, fleeing from the enemy in war, not sheathing weapons after drawing them until attaining something from the enemy, permissibility of continuous fasting (wisal), the fifth (khums) and the chosen share of booty (safi al-maghnam), entering Mecca without ihram (halal), making his estate charity not inherited, marriage by the word of 'gift' from the wife without dowry, guardian, or witnesses, and while in Ihram, and marrying more than four, and whomever he chose became forbidden for the husband to marry and he was obliged to divorce her, and the prohibition of his wives after his death to the Ummah, so their marriage is not lawful to anyone. As for those other than them from the rest of their nations, no one has a specific property distinguishing him in terms of Sharia. So look at Ibn al-Athir, may God have mercy on him, he did not match the denial with the citation. If King Al-Nasir had answered him about that and said: 'The servant did not combine the kunya of the Commander of the Faithful and his name, nor singled out one of them, so what is the face of denial upon me?' he would have had the right to say that. Furthermore, King Al-Nasir, may God Almighty have mercy on him, did not name himself with this title while Al-Nasir was a Caliph among the Abbasids. Rather, Al-Adid, one of the Fatimid Caliphs in Egypt, when he appointed him vizier in the year 564 AH, titled him with this title, and the Caliph in Baghdad at that time was Al-Mustadi' Bi-Amr Allah.\n\n**The Letter of Ibn Ziyadah al-Baghdadi**\nAs for Ibn Ziyadah's saying: 'And all that the master deems good is forbidden for the slave,' it is appropriate, and perhaps he brought it in a form better than this, and it came during his speech naturally. Ibn al-Athir did not mention what he brought so its beauty or ugliness could be known. Ibn Ziyadah's speech was not present with me when commenting on this chapter, and perhaps I will find it later and establish it in the margin. I stood upon Ibn Ziyadah's speech later, and what he concluded the chapter of denial on the title with was: 'And it is strange that the Commander of the Faithful is addressed by one marked with kingship with what was not his, and he competes regarding what belongs to another. And among the elegant wisdom in concise speech: That which is proper for the master is forbidden for the slave.' End quote. I say: This rhymed phrase is a verse of poetry from verses written by Amr bin Mas'adah to Al-Ma'mun with a horse he gifted him, which was dark with a blaze: 'O Imam whom no one approaches / when a Imam is counted / We have sent a steed / whose like cannot be sought / His face is morning but / the rest of the body is darkness / And that which is proper...' the verse. Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God have mercy on him, answered Ibn Ziyadah's letter with a lengthy reply, but he was gentle in it and not harsh, and outnumbered and not baring teeth. Then Judge Muhyiddin ibn Abd al-Zahir, may God Almighty have mercy on him, dictated a reply to the mentioned letter on behalf of Saladin, lengthening it to the limit, although he competed and discussed, and forced and peeled. Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God have mercy on him, has an apparent excuse at that time for flattering, due to the greatness of the position of the Caliphate in that time. By my life, this letter weakened the arm of King Al-Nasir and lowered him, and the notable people who had authority in other than his lands refrained from saying anything but Sultan Saladin instead of King Al-Nasir, due to the Caliph's denial of that. Perhaps this matter remains to this time, for only Sultan Saladin is said mostly. These two replies I have established in the thirteenth part of the Tadhkira (Memorandum) which I collected.\n\n**Rhetoric and Eloquence**",

    "text": "He said in the eighth chapter on Eloquence (Fasaha) and Rhetoric (Balagha), when mentioning Rhetoric, after establishing that Rhetoric is for meanings and Eloquence is for words: 'Rhetoric is comprehensive of words and meanings, and it is more specific than Eloquence, like the human compared to the animal. For every human is an animal, but not every animal is a human. Likewise, it is said: Every rhetorical speech is eloquent, but not every eloquent speech is rhetorical. It is distinguished from Eloquence from every other aspect other than general and specific, which is that it only exists in word and meaning on the condition of composition (tarkib), for a single word is not called Rhetoric, but is called Eloquence, since the description specific to Eloquence, which is beauty, exists in it. As for Rhetoric, it does not exist in it due to its emptiness of useful meaning that organizes speech.'\n\nI say: He claimed that this second differentiator is other than the first, but it is the very same one and its lie. For he first intended: Every eloquent speech can be called rhetorical, but not the reverse. The meaning of this is, if we say: 'Stop, let us weep at the memory of a beloved and a dwelling' (Qifa nabki...), this speech is rhetorical considering that its meaning reached in the molding of its composition a limit that fulfills the complete intent. And it is eloquent considering the clarity of its vocabulary, its beauty, and its sweetness in hearing. If we dismantle this composition and take every individual word of it, every individual is eloquent, but not rhetorical due to the lack of composition in meaning. So Eloquence became more general than Rhetoric because it is found in singularity and composition. And Rhetoric became more specific because it only covers the compound. So wherever Rhetoric is found with the sweetness of words, Eloquence is found, but not the reverse. So it is correct that Rhetoric is like Humanity in its specificity, and Eloquence is like Animality in its generality. This meaning exists exactly in the second differentiator he presented. For he said: Rhetoric is only in word and meaning on the condition of composition... to the end. So contemplate his words, and what I said will appear to you.\n\n**Defining the meaning of Rhetoric and Eloquence**\nWhat I say is: Between Rhetoric and Eloquence, there is generality from one aspect and specificity from another. Explanation: As for the generality of Rhetoric, it covers eloquent speech, i.e., beautiful and clear, and non-eloquent speech, i.e., strange and wild. As for the generality of Eloquence, it covers compound words only. As for the specificity of Eloquence, it covers only sweet, used words. So it is proven that between Rhetoric and Eloquence there is generality from one aspect and specificity from another. The like of this, Ibn al-Athir does not notice.\n\n**Divisions of the Science of Bayan (Imagery)**\nHe said in this chapter: 'As for the divisions of the Science of Bayan from Eloquence and Rhetoric, they are not so because they were deduced by observation and the judgment of reason without the layer of language, and there was no need in them for transmission (tawqif). Rather, words and meanings were taken in a specific form, and reason judged them with the merit of beauty that no other shares. For every knower of the secrets of speech in any language knows that bringing out meanings in beautiful, pleasing words that the ear delights in and nature does not recoil from, is better than bringing them out in ugly, detestable words that the ear recoils from. Even if the layer of language wanted otherwise, we would not imitate him.'\n\nI say: He claimed that this is pure reason. If he meant by 'Bayan' what the masters of Rhetoric agreed upon—which is one of the divisions of the Science of Rhetoric applied to knowing Reality (Haqiqa), Metaphor (Majaz), Simile (Tashbih), Metonymy (Kinaya), and Allusion (Isti'ara)—then among Metaphor is the linguistic one, like 'Salah' (Prayer). The Lawgiver used it in this specific form comprising standing, reciting, bowing, prostrating, remembrance, peace, and supplication. In the origin of language, it applies only to supplication, which is a part of this form, so He named it by the name of its part. Thus, knowing this metaphor depended on its reality (original meaning), and that reality is not known except by transmission, not by reason. And that which depends on what depends on knowing a thing depends on that thing.\n\n**Allusion (Isti'ara) and Metonymy (Kinaya)**\nAs for Allusion (Isti'ara), the scholars of Bayan differed: is it a linguistic metaphor or a rational one? The majority went to the view that it is a linguistic metaphor, contrary to the author of 'Al-Miftah' who held it is rational. The proof of the majority is that if you said: 'I have a lion fully armed,' and you mean the brave man, the word 'lion' upon verification is used in other than what it was placed for, because you understand that he has a man he likened to the lion. The tool of simile was omitted for exaggeration, but understanding the meaning of Alif, Sin, and Dal depends on transmission. As for Metonymy (Kinaya), among its divisions is a section dependent on transmission. Like the poet's saying: 'The brother of Lakhm lent you a garment from him / congratulations on the new shirt / Your father wanted your mother when she was led in wedding / but no daughter of Sa'd was found for your mother.'",

    "text": "'And Abu Ubaid cast a cloak / upon you, so you became the most clothed of the people of Najd / God showed me your eye in the quiver / and your eye is the eye of Bashar bin Burd.' The poet meant by 'brother of Lakhm' the Judham tribe, and by 'daughter of Sa'd' the Udhra tribe [known for chaste love or virginity], and by 'Abu Ubaid' leprosy [Al-Baras], and by 'eye of Bashar' blindness. And the saying of Muhammad bin Abdun about wine turning to vinegar: 'Verily, in the path of amusement is a cup of wine / that came to us with the taste of its covenant not fixed / It imitated the daughter of Bistam bin Qais in the morning / and went like the body of Al-Shanfara after Thabit.' He meant by 'daughter of Bistam' reddish wine (Sahba'), and by 'body of Al-Shanfara' his saying: 'Give it to me, O Sawad bin Amr / for my body after my friend is vinegar (khall).' And the saying of the other: 'He claims drinking in a cup and a bowl / and the mother of Antara al-Absi suffices him.' Meaning 'Zabiba' (Raisin) because it is the name of Antara al-Absi's mother. Were it not for transmission, nothing of these metonymies would be known, and reason has no field here. So it has become clear that some of Bayan is transmitted. If he meant by Bayan the Science of Meanings (Ilm al-Ma'ani)—which is what is known by tracking the properties of word structures, of the conditions of predicative attribution, conditions of the subject, conditions of the predicate, separation and connection, brevity and verbosity, and conditions of demand—then most of that depends on transmission for its knowledge, since the predicate and subject are the Mubtada' and Khabar, and the conditions of each are varied, from advancing and delaying each, making them definite or indefinite, omitting this sometimes and that other times, and the coming of the subject sometimes as a noun and sometimes as a verb, either past or present. Were it not for fear of elongation, I would have given examples of that, but they are known from Grammar. All of that is originally what transmission brought. And this is the bulk of the Science of Meanings. So it is proven that Bayan is not rational as Ibn al-Athir claimed, but some is rational and some is transmitted. Furthermore, people have raised objections to the Science of Meanings, saying: If it were intuitive, it would not need learning and codification, and mentioning it would be dispensed with. And if it were acquired (kasbi), it would require another science, and it would circle or regress infinitely. And whatever leads to that is false. It was answered that not all of it is intuitive so that follows. Rather, some is intuitive perceived by sound taste and straight mind, and some is acquired taken by transmission. Since people are on three levels: The first are owners of sound nature, the pure Arabs who bring speech by their instinct to its proper places; these are dispensed from learning it because it is instinct and nature for them. The second level are the rough ones, owners of crudeness and repelling natures who have no feeling for the meanings of speech, nor aptitude to acquire that; these are also dispensed from learning it, for there is no benefit for them in it. The third level are the intermediate ones, between these and those; they may be correct sometimes in their thoughts and may err. These are the ones for whom this tool was placed. If they observe its codified laws and established limits, they are further from error. In that case, this class cannot dispense with learning this tool.\n\n**Explanations of the Grammarians**\nHe said in this chapter also: 'And that which the grammarians burden themselves with of causal explanations (ta'lil) is weak and does not stand on the touchstone of observation.'\nI say: Ibn Abi al-Hadid answered him in 'Al-Falak Al-Da'ir' about that. But the speech was not matured with him, and it needs a remaining appendage. Which is to say to him: It seems you did not look into this science with true looking, nor saw what Ibn al-Sarraj, Al-Rummani, Abu Ali, Al-Sirafi and those after them like Ibn Jinni mentioned in 'Al-Khasa'is' and 'Sirr al-Sina'a' and Ibn al-Anbari in 'Asrar al-Arabiyya' and others, of good explanation for the rules of grammar, and the correspondences they revealed, even if there is leniency in some because they committed to explaining everything transmitted from the Arabs. Just as Abu Ali committed in 'Al-Hujjah' to explaining the Seven Readings, and Ibn Jinni in 'Al-Muhtasib' in explaining the Anomalous Readings, not all of which match the rules of Grammar in appearance, especially the reading of Abu Amr, may God have mercy on him, because he was the most grounded of them in grammar. For this reason, grammarians criticized Ibn Amir, may God have mercy on him, in his famous reading of His Almighty's saying: 'Wa kadhalika zuyyina likathirin min al-mushrikina qatlu awladahum shuraka'ihim' (And thus the killing of their children was made appealing to many of the polytheists by their partners). By changing 'zuyyina' to passive, raising 'qatlu' as a subject, installing the Dal of 'awladahum' as the object of the source (masdar) which is 'qatl', and genitizing 'shuraka'ihim' because it is the actor of the source and genitized by annexation, and the source is not annexed except to its actor.",

    "text": "So Ibn Amir separated between the Source (Masdar) and its Actor (Fa'il) which is the annexed-to, which is other than what the grammarians established. They were excessive in criticizing him, yet it is permissible. It came from the Arabs often in their poetry, and Sheikh Jamal al-Din ibn Malik, may God have mercy on him, cited numerous witnesses for it in the explanation of 'Al-Kafiya', and prevented the opponent by saying this chapter is permissible in poetic necessity, and there is no necessity in the Quran. Al-Kawashi defended Ibn Amir in his Tafsir and supported this reading. This is the state of the jurists; most of their explanations for what was transmitted in the rulings of the noble Sharia are the ultimate in goodness and strength, and in some there is leniency. Like one who wanted to explain some rituals of Hajj, for it is not as strong as others. Al-Ghazali in 'Al-Ihya' spoke about this nicely. Similarly the state of the theologians (Mutakallimun), for some of their proofs do not reach strength in what they brought regarding the origin of the world and the soul, proving Oneness, and the non-existence of direction. Sometimes they have few issues whose proofs are weak, not reaching in certainty and decisiveness and binding the opponent the amount of those. Were it not for that, disagreement would not have occurred in Grammar between Basrans and Kufans, nor between the owners of schools in branches, like the four Imams and those other than them of the follower jurists and the literalists, may God be pleased with them all, nor between the theologians in the principles of religion from the Ash'aris, Mu'tazilis, Imamis, Kharijis, and Hashawis. It is as if he looked at the saying of Ibn Faris the author of 'Al-Mujmal': 'A slender, well-formed woman passed us / Turkish, attributed to a Turk / Gazing with a captivating, languid glance / weaker than the argument of a grammarian.' Does he not know that in poetry and rhetoric, the slightest doubt circulates, and the smallest gleam illuminates? The poet's saying here is only relative to necessary matters, like the mutual exclusion of opposites, that one is half of two, and that a single body does not occupy two spaces together at one time and the like. Although some people denied these axioms and attacked their validity while admitting sensory perceptions. And some people denied sensory perceptions and attacked them while being certain of axioms. And some people attacked both and denied sensory perceptions and axioms, and they are the Sophists. It is told that Salih bin Abd al-Quddus lost a son, so Abu al-Hudhayl went to him accompanied by Al-Nazzam who was a young lad. He saw his grief and said to him: 'I do not know a face for your grief since people to you are like crops!' Salih said: 'O Abu al-Hudhayl, I only grieve for him because he did not read the Book of Doubts.' He said: 'What is it?' He said: 'A book I wrote; whoever reads it doubts what was until he imagines it was not, and what was not until he thinks it was.' Al-Nazzam said to him: 'Then doubt regarding your son that he did not die even if he died, and act as if he lived until he read the book even if he did not live until he read it.' Salih was dumbfounded and silenced. If the matter reached this limit in obstinacy, what is your thought of one who explains the nominative of the subject and the accusative of the object and the operation of 'Lam' for jussive and 'In' for condition and answer and other things? The door of dialectic is open to anyone who wants to prevent something. For this reason it is said: If you debate a Mu'tazili on the issue of Vision (Ru'ya), stick to the side of prevention (denial). Whoever wants to deny something denies it and tires his opponent, so he cannot conquer him. 'Nothing is correct in understandings / if the day needs proof.' Yes, if your opponent sticks to the truth and intends it, you win the desire from him, and pull him after obstinacy to correctness smoothly led. But if he is obstinate, ignorant, or denying, then you are striking cold iron and have wasted your blowing in the ash. 'No proof stands for the people of love / regarding the whiteness of a morning or the blackness / of a night.' And O Ibn al-Athir: If the explanations of the grammarians were weak and did not stand on the touchstone of observation, then what stands on the touchstone of observation from the explanations of the masters of Meanings (Ma'ani), being what they are? Most of what they rely on are rhetorical semblances not definitive. If they were opposed in them, they would stop in many of them. Sheikh Taqi al-Din ibn Daqiq al-Eid, may God Almighty have mercy on him, used to say: 'The science of Meanings and Bayan is until now not matured by nature.' Sheikh Fath al-Din ibn Sayyid al-Nas told me this about him in the Egyptian lands in the year 728 AH, for he was his special student. I do not doubt that many arguments are stronger, more decisive, and closer to certainty than many arguments of the masters of Meanings; indeed, between them is the comparative form (Af'al). 'So bring a decisive proof regarding that / Or leave things covered / And enter us into the wide relationship.'\n\n**What the Writer and Poet share**\nHe said in the ninth chapter on the pillars of writing: 'That the writer is one who excels in the opening (Matla') and the closing (Maqta'), or it should be built upon the intent of the letter.' Then he said: 'And this is shared by the writer and the poet.'",

    "text": "I say: This contains leniency, for the poet does not always open his poem with what indicates his intent. For one who praises seeks support and aid with money, a mount, intercession, or seeking an office, then he starts that poem with ghazal (love poetry) describing his beloved, or describing passion, estrangement, longing, or travel—how does that happen for him? Yes, if it is pure praise without ghazal, that fits it, and mostly praise is stripped of ghazal if it is about an incident that occurred to the praised one, so the poet congratulates him either on an office appointment, victory over an enemy, a newborn, safety from an accident that befell him, congratulations on health, recovery, or other new incidents. Were it not for fear of elongation, I would mention witnesses for that. As for the writer, if he writes to one below him, equal to him, or higher than him, such that addressing him with supplication is possible, he needs the supplication to be appropriate to what the letter contains of longing, loneliness, gift, request for a gift, intercession, asking for a command, thanks, congratulations, condolences, or whatever fits the situation. This type has been maintained only by the late writers, especially in investitures (taqalid) and signatures (tawaqi'), for they observed that. Were it not for fear of elongation, I would have cited a sufficient amount of that. However, the people of this era do not need alerting to this, because this matter has become famous among its writers. It has remained the ultimate goal sought from the writer. So much so that it is said: He opened his investiture or signature or letter with such-and-such. And he mentions the name of the owner of the investiture in the first rhyme, or alerts to the meaning of what the letter contained. So among them is the predecessor and among them is the failing. Often the name of the addressee and the function coincide, so the writer alerts to the meaning. Do you not see how excellent is the saying of... who wrote an investiture for heir apparent for Sultan Al-Malik Al-Ashraf Salah al-Din, saying: 'Praise be to God who made the King most noble (Al-Ashraf) goodness of the religion (Salah al-Din).' So he did not borrow anything for him. The like of this happened to me in a signature I wrote for the Chief Judge of the Hanafis, Imad al-Din Ali, for teaching at the Qaymaziyya Madrasa, so I said: 'Praise be to God who made Imad al-Din (Pillar of Religion) High (Ali).' So I did not borrow anything for him. This happens often. And the saying of Judge Muhyiddin ibn Abd al-Zahir, writing an investiture for heir apparent for Sultan Al-Malik Al-Salih Ala' al-Din Ali on behalf of his father Sultan Al-Malik Al-Mansur, saying: 'Praise be to God who honored the throne of kingship with its Ali (High one), and guarded it from him with his Wasi (Guardian), and supported his Mansur (Victor) with a Mahdi (Guided) heir apparent.' And the saying of Judge Ala' al-Din ibn Abd al-Zahir, may God Almighty have mercy on him, in an investiture he wrote for Rukn al-Din Baybars al-Muzaffar, when he took possession on behalf of our master the Commander of the Faithful Abu al-Rabi' Sulayman, may God prolong his days, opening it by saying: 'It is from Solomon (Sulayman) and it is In the Name of God the Most Gracious the Most Merciful.' And Fakhr al-Din ibn Luqman wrote on behalf of Al-Malik Al-Sa'id son of Al-Malik Al-Zahir, may God have mercy on them both, an investiture for the ministry of Burhan al-Din al-Sinjari, opening it with His Almighty's saying: 'O people, a Burhan (Proof) has come to you from your Lord.' In this glimpse is sufficiency. But it appeared first that the poet is not bound like the writer to observe openings.\n\n**How the Creative Writer benefits from Literary Heritage**\nHe said in the tenth chapter on the path to learning writing: 'Second, that he mixes the writing of the predecessors with what he innovates for himself of good addition: either in improving words or improving meanings.' Then he said: 'Except that this path is very rugged, and none can do it except one whom God has provided with an attacking tongue and an embroidering mind. Its difficulties have been eased for me and its passes humbled, and I was stingy to show that because of the suffering I endured in attaining it.'\nI say: He walked a path and Al-Qadi Al-Fadil a path: 'They turned to my destruction and I turned to satisfaction / difference is between their path and my path.' For the Judge, may God have mercy on him, amazed when he eased, and Ibn al-Athir, may God forgive him, saddened when he saddened. Although most of what he brought in his path is: unravelling verse (hall al-manzoum), and embedding proverbs. He is not the father of this virginity (idea), nor the stringer of that nugget. Where is his speech compared to the speech of the Vizier Abu al-Walid ibn Zaydun: Whoever stands upon his correspondence knows his good arrival at this art and his subtle means. Especially his letter he wrote on the tongue of Wallada bint al-Mustakfi to the Vizier Abu Amir ibn Abdus, and the letter he wrote to Ibn Jahwar seeking his sympathy. For he brought in these two letters wonders and marvels, and included in them proverbs, incidents, and unravelling of verses what increased, and diffused his ambergris in every club, because he gathered in them, so he called out, and strung the pearls of that as twins and singles, so every letter came... 'Hearing it moves the sides of highness / and sends the rapture of intellects and excites.'",

    "text": "There, the value of this man is known in his extensive reading, the spread of his shadow, and the utmost of his elevation. It was even said: His prose is more like verse. Ibn Khalaf parsed the Hamasa and added to it in a volume he named 'Al-Manthur al-Baha'i' and claimed in it that he was the one who invented unravelling verse, just as Al-Khalil bin Ahmad invented Prosody. As for Ibn al-Athir, he increased the unravelling, and brought in it what is forbidden and what is lawful, and increased his embroidery in his cloaks, and exaggerated his stringing in his necklaces. 'The cheek is beautiful with one mole / and becomes little with many moles.' He brought in it the fat and the lean, and did not bring a new thing without coupling it with the worn out. Unravelling verse is only one type, and a section that if lost, he would not be finding of it. Whatever does not allow lightness to promote it, and sweetness to couple it with hearing and marry it, its earring does not cling to the hearing, nor does its condition pass with acceptance. I liken it only to a necklace whose beads were scattered, and a garden whose flowers withered. So what beauty is there for poetry whose meter betrayed it, and what freshness for a garden whose rain shunned it? Unless the composer is of sound nature, straight thought, correcting for the poet what he missed, sharpening his sword and straightening his spear, either by avoiding what he did not deviate from, or bringing a compatible thing not possible due to strictness of meter, or by abbreviating what the meaning stands without, or by increasing the blossom of its branches, or by quality of casting, or perfection of weaving. Here the capable power appears, and the proofs of eloquence become clear. 'Not for the connection of one who calls then comes / is the sweetness of the connection of one who calls then refuses.'\n\nAs for Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God have mercy on him, he walked a strange path, and showed wondrous arts. Some claimed that his main reliance was on memorizing the words of Ibn Abi al-Shakhba, and that he used to recall most of his speech. Some claimed he relied on the speech of Ibn Abi al-Khisal, and some claimed he relied on the speech of Al-Badi'. Far from it, there is not in the speech of any one of them that euphoria, nor for a speaker other than him that step in attaining favor, nor for a correspondent his beauty which split the hearts of men if not cutting the hands of women. While he addresses you with speech, suddenly he has given you cups of wine. And while he mimics your blowing wind, suddenly he has bewitched your core. And while he speaks like people customarily, suddenly he has listed burning stars. And while he has turned his back to you, suddenly he has turned the face to you. And while he walks with you on the soil, suddenly he struts at the Pleiades. 'If it is of pearls, pearls are not like this / And if it is magic, indeed this is wondrous.' Here I present a portion of his speech to be a title for the rest, and a piece to be a scale between him and others. Of that is a letter he wrote describing a letter written by Muwaffaq al-Din Khalid bin Muhadhdhab al-Din al-Qaysarani in gold, which is:\n\n'The servant stood upon what the fingers of the Presence adorned—the one whose cloud, if it rains, creates a garden immediately, and if real magic is missing, it is she whose expression blew into the panic of her pen. So he moved from approval to glorification because its letters are beads of the rosary, and cleared preference from weighting with the first thing the eye shook hands with of novelty (tarf) and the glance of pleasantry (milh). So he took from it a garden adorned with fire, and a night sash-wrapped with day, and a meadow watered with streams of wine, and branches of pens opened with gold blossoms, and a cloud of gold melted, the flash of its lightning almost taking away sight. Exalted is He who softened iron for David, peace be upon him, and gold for her, and awakened by him the grandfather of this industry after he slept among creation, so he woke. And he informed people that the pen in the hand of Ibn al-Bawwab is for beating not for delight (tarab), and that the value is yours from it and from him regarding what is written in this industry. He adorned it with full moons and gave it what he gave his father, a crescent from waning, and delayed its time and advanced his time, and granted it precedence and denied him catching up.",

    "text": "Among Alifs, the Hamzas have accustomed their branches as doves; and Lam-Alifs, after it the lover envies them for the embrace of their soft figures; and Sads that quenched the thirst of thirsty eyes and hovering hearts; and Waws reminding of what is in the garden of temples of curves; and Mims whose mouths approached their mouths to attain the harvest of sips; and Sins like the serration in those teeth; and Dals indicating (dalat) obedience to their writer by the bending of backs; and Jims like beaks hunting hearts that flutter at the frights of admiration like birds. In it is what souls desire and eyes delight in. Khalid is eternal (khalid) in it, and his greeting in it is praise, and his hand strikes in molten gold while creation strikes in cold iron. It is the hand that strings the crowns of kings with its pearls, and reveals the sign of generosity on its papers by what it reveals of its gold dust. I did not think before his hand that a cloud rains gold, nor that water draws ink from fire, nor that its pens are swords that shed the blood of wealth and made it flow as rivers. Nor before his glance that twilight does not fear the rising of dawn, nor that the color of connection shakes off the color of abandonment, nor that the night clings to the side of lightning and does not depart, nor that the gold of the afternoon flows with the blackness of the pitch-dark night. Nor that a noble hand claims from the signs of its pen and the miracles of its generosity that the rock parts with solidity, and that skill marches its star over thirst so it speaks directly to the watered source of freshness. The scripts of the virtuous were nothing but an experiment before its editing now, nor were their pens anything but wood it kindled upon gold so it melted for it and softened. Nor is calligraphy reckoned except by its hand, so it changed the clothes of mourning for it and unveiled the brides of its letters, their bodies perfumed with saffron, and rose the pupil of the eye of beneficence with the proof that it only glances in blackness. It prostrated to it, and prostration is its duty because it is below crowns, and kissed it, and kissing is its right because Paradise converses from it the houris of Paradise. And how not to prefer its essence by detailing, and meet its letters by kissing, when people wrote by hand and he wrote by eye, and people obtained from this industry after the Battle of Hunayn the shoes of Hunayn (nothing), while she won what she showed of her blossom to the onlookers of gold, and alchemy became correct for her, because he wrote with half a dinar a line worth a thousand dinars. And that he has in its day—nay in its rivers—a long swimming, and that despite its light weight and few lines, it costs a heavy burden of thanks. And how does the scale of praise not lighten against rivers of his argument with molten gold? And how does the delegation of thanks go astray when she guided it with locks of flame? He unfolded it and folded it until he almost broke it, and grazed a gaze in it that did not tire of it, so the last thing he contemplated was the first thing he glanced at, and forgot due to his fascination to worship his doctrine (madhhab - also means gilded) on a letter or on a paper. And he arrived at it as he measures his arrival, so he increased in thirst despite much sipping and drinking, and it blinded him when it covered him, and much light blinds the sight of eyes.'\n\nAnd from that is what he described the tents among a number of letters, which is:\n'As for the tents, they have worn out and become mixed, and thinned so they mixed the cup of clouds with a mood, and met distress with us—and our distress was that we saw relief in them. In them are patches from the sky, as if hearing took them in the tearing of clothes. If the winds blow, they are in their advancing and retreating in a persistent removal, and a malicious incitement from Satan. They divorced us while still in our ropes, and stabbed while still in our shackles. If the wind sends a sign, their necks remain submissive to it. If we sit in them, it is on the middle of the road while they are sitting on the road of the calamity (Qari'a). If they fall at night, their fall has no raising (ref. Quran). They have the wounds of needles from time which do not stitch, and from them are ruins upon time which the eye believes sometimes and denies. Their sky has opened and split, and listened to its Lord and was obligated. There remains no skin in their hide to blame, nor a hold in their patience to pull. It is as if they and their sisters, when the winds blow, are the criminals seeing the punishment, and the ropes are cut off with them. Whereby you see their protection shaking, and the obstacle has entered upon them truly as an obstacle. Their pillars are branches shaken by the hot wind, and their ribbons are sparks flown by the striker. But if clouds rise, they draw the swords of their lightning, and chain the torrents of their rain; they are wounded in front of those swords, and thrown behind those torrents. They wish what Noah's son wished on the day of no protector, and you see them like water ducks while we are between drowned and floating. We beat them every day above the limit (hadd), and take them in the summer with the war of heat and in the winter with the cold of cold.'",

    "text": "And from that is a letter he issued from Ba'rin, which is:\n'The settlement is in Ba'rin, where the sky brought out its burdens and opened locks from its spouts, and the horses of thunder galloped wearing their coverings of clouds. The robe of night is washed by the water of clouds, and the ghost of darkness is killed by the sword of lightning. The crow of the horizon is a falcon in the atmosphere, except that it is drawing the bow of Qazah (Rainbow), and it is as if the scorpions of darkness are snakes in the snow, so let the night of its companion be the night of the snake-bitten. As if the locations of thunder are the clatter of women's jewelry, so it neither sleeps nor lets sleep. As if the morning has melted into the night as drops. As if the lightning, when it equaled the clouds between the two shells of night and day, said: 'Bring me, I will pour molten copper upon it.' The wing of the draped night is wet so it does not fly, and the dove of morning slowed contrary to what it intended in Noah's message so it does not march. The winds have stormed and broke the sticks of Najd and crushed them, and the clouds galloped their horses so the lightning was their white markings and nose-spots. As for the tents whose skins matured by the kindle of the sun and turned black, then were sprinkled with the tears of clouds so their eyelids relaxed after they were tight. They are nothing but eyes from which kohl flowed with tears, and black horses whose hobbles were untied by the winds from the tent-ropes. The dispute continues between them and the winds until they tear the clothes from their war as the clouds tore them from their rapture. We persist in tying their tails (tunub), to enter into the contract of their reckoning (hasab). Far from it, their figures were robbed in the compass, and their souls exited by the winds. If the sun rises, the East throws cups that settle on the sight, not the Dinars of Abu al-Tayyib (Mutanabbi) which flee from the fingertips. The winds did not seek refuge in their side, and refuse the ropes from releasing them in the rein of recklessness, except resembling a sandgrouse whose wing was caught by a trap, and a mote whose eye was shaken by a catch and refused to leave. The torrents increased until these tents became bubbles upon them, and the thunder mumbled reading so their standing settled between prostrating and bowing. I am in them like Uthman in his house, and the calamity has begun its siege. The arrows of the rain do not cease drowning, and I do not cease ditching against the torrent for myself. We have returned to the first creation, so we returned in this water as a clot ('alaqa). No ingratitude to God, for I am thrown on the roads of calamities, meeting what greyed life of separation mixing with the grey of the parting (hair). I did not fear that time would move me from the degree of its plucked harvest, to the path of its sweeping streams. Never was seen stranger than me, barren while I complain of treacherous ponds, and drought-stricken complaining of the darkness of rainy nights. May God uglify Ba'rin, even if the Lion of Islam took shelter in a lair ('arin) of it, and I am innocent of it by the number of the sands of Yabrin.'\n\nFrom that: 'And that direction, although it is Western (Gharibah), the West (Gharb) is the repository of lights, the treasure of the sun's dinar, and the estuary of the rivers of the day.'\nFrom that: 'In summary, if Rhetoric is a religion, then one who does not unify Him has committed heresy; and if it is a sword, then one who does not gird it has exposed himself to the edge; and if it is a bedding, then what it does not birth has been exiled from the back of Rhetoric.'\nFrom that: 'If you possessed time, you would have ridden its nights as dark horses, and girded its days as sharp swords, and gifted its suns and moons as dinars and dirhams. Your days are weddings, as if no funerals for money took place in them. Generosity is a ring in your hands, and the soul of Hatim is in the engraving of that ring.'\nFrom that: 'So may God refresh that spirit, and open for it the doors of Paradise, for it is the last of what it hoped for of openings (Futuh).'\nFrom that regarding the thanks for his favor: 'By God, his favor is like the sun in clarity; I do not deny it. If it were permissible to worship the sun in God's religion, I would have worshipped it. For it is a sun that never cast a hand (ray/favor) on a disbeliever, nor placed a hand except on a grateful one.'\nFrom that: 'If the speech from me reached the hearing as it reached the heart, and if you saw his sword dyed from its seat in my chest, I would not have sensed the war. If he determined to strike, I would move him so he becomes of the struck (darb - type/minting) not of the striking (darb).' \nFrom that: 'Hearts are good, and rains are pouring. There has become upon the side of every crop of them a splint showing itself, and upon the ear of every earring of them a pearl trembling.'\nFrom that: 'So may I not lack those breaths which are precious things (Nafa'is), and those noble ladies which are brides, and those jewels which please me that they expose my honor, and those arrows which are, by God, my target.'\nFrom that: 'We trusted in the success of the request, and held onto the horns of Hamah, so we obtained the milking (halab) of Aleppo (Halab).'\nFrom that mentioning the Nile: 'Its current pushes, pushing back the chest of drought with the hand of fertility, and suckling the mothers of its canals until their sons are with grain and grass.'\nFrom that: 'The wastelands have spread what filled them of the sheets of mirage, and there roared in them what was born illegitimately on the bed of clouds.'\nFrom that: 'If the beautiful forgiveness familiar from this House pardons him, then by their pardon God sharpened their edge, and by their amnesty God succeeded their effort, and by their following of their father, mercy be upon him, God Almighty raised their grandfather (luck/status).'",

Whatever harms the beauties of Sahban (eloquent man) to run on the tongue of Baqil (stammerer).' \nFrom that: 'Happiness whose green pasture does not wither, security not saddened by the Great Terror, obeyed by the penetration of its disposal the white (sword) and the brown (spear), beloved of the pen so that even if the sword opposed it, it would be said to it: your hater is the cut-off one (abtar).' \nFrom that: 'And He did not deprive me of his favor which breaks the seals of the pages of affection, and overflows the paths of praise, and his covenant which combined with the lasting of the myrtle the freshness of the rose, and with the appearance of the garden the quenching of the arrival (wird).'\nFrom that: 'Until this flood clears from us, and until the handkerchiefs of the eyes dry, for they were squeezed by tears.'\nFrom that: 'And He ransomed him with his allies and brothers, and no dignity for his enemies and no blessing for his envier. And He kept for time his sovereignty which protected his sons from the evil of his play.'\nFrom that: 'Two letters arrived from our master expanding the chest, gladdening the secret, and removing the worry. They met me with conquest (Fath - also vowel 'a') and I met them with embrace (Damm - also vowel 'u').'\nFrom that: 'The noble decree arrived from the Mighty Diwan, so its light refused going astray for it, and its shining and unveiling granted it guidance and calm. Its joy and ink (habir) filled the fear of the hope-filled. Its crime and guilt did not return until its garden and silk became its shield. The gaze of his eye trained in a garden, nose to nose (unf unf - fresh), that nothing expresses it except its perfume ('abir). It removed sins from him and settled him in high degrees, so it is his bracelet, his wall, and his bed.'\nFrom that: 'He divided so he was just, and gave abundantly so he excelled, and reached so there was no sufficiency in reaching, and opened flowers whose like was not reached by the arm of a seeker. To God is it of a letter, and to God is his pen; this one reported what was permissible, and this one imitated what he crafted.'\nFrom that: 'As for the letter to the debtor of beauty, may God combine wealth with beauty for him, and relieve him from the agreement of these two rhymes so that beauty becomes abundant wealth (al-jamal al-jamm al-mal).'\nFrom that: 'Grace is in God's hand, He gives it to whom He serves. He has increased him from it so he did not lack his grace. No competitor competes with him except he was foolish, and was a greengrocer (baqlah) in the path of the torrent.'\nFrom that: 'Every word is connected to a moan, and in every heart from his sadness is fire, and in every house from his favor is a paradise.'\nFrom that: 'I did not reach the place of health from it, except I had turned pale and was cut off, and said the rest of the bright predecessor. The cloud of merit is too shy to narrow until it almost raises the one standing with the palm.'\nFrom that: 'He enriched him by the guarding of his word from his cautioning, and enriched the King from using his arrow by his paper.'\nFrom that: 'May He perpetuate his mastery over his people, and protect him by the fertility of his saddlebag from the barrenness of his place. May we not lack from his word what testifies that it is honey (shahd) truly, not a gift (nihla) he claimed (nahalah) nor a sculptured palm tree (nahila nakhla).'\nFrom that: 'And may He destroy every enemy of his and humiliate him, and make life a speck in the eye and harm for him. I stood from them upon woven, chain-mail rhetoric, and hidden precious jewels, and fruits he gathered from the good tree of rhetoric, while some people gather from the cursed tree.'\nFrom that: 'He is that branch which He watered until it wrapped in its leaves, and strutted in its silk and brocade, and white dawn spoke directly to him after he could not attain its blue.'\nFrom that: 'People spent the night surrounding the fortress, and fires surrounding them and wrapping them. The tails of its tongues were let down on his face and draped from behind him. Its blasts were hellish, its fuel people and stones, and the calamity calls out: Tiberias, I mean you, and hear, O neighbor.'\nFrom that: 'Kings cease not to be standing at his door, and destines are swords for him. Creation are guests for him in the abode of the world. And the religion, the religion of truth, teaches people that if swords are drawn to exact from him, 'my swords' (su-yufi - will fulfill).'\n\nI say: How did you see these arranged pearls and agreed beauties? Did any other bring this pattern, or win these points in the treasures of writers ever? 'This is speech veiled from kings / so do not humiliate it by increasing it to the commoners.' His mention will appear during this book, around which its cups revolve and its suns shine.\n\n**Al-Safadi criticizes Ibn al-Athir in some of his composition**\nAs for Ibn al-Athir's saying, may God have mercy on him, in this chapter which I presented: 'Except one whom God gave an attacking (hajjam) tongue and an embroidering (raqqam) mind.' I say: I do not know what to say in this. What is the relation between 'hajjam' and 'raqqam'? Furthermore, borrowing 'embroidering' (raqm) for the mind (khatir) is far-fetched. Embroidery is truly for the hand and metaphorically for the pen. What is the meaning of the 'attacking tongue'? If he had said a 'speaking (qawwal) tongue' and a 'roaming (jawwal) mind', or a 'tongue of sharp edge' and a 'heart that does not fear war', or a 'composing (nazzam) tongue' and 'embroidering fingertips', or the like, it would have been better.",

    "text": "He said in this chapter: 'Whoever stands upon what I mentioned knows that I did not bring a fabricated thing (shay'an fariyya), and that God has placed under my mind a stream (sariyya) from the daughters of thoughts.'\nI say: He is here in a station of magnifying what he brought in the art of writing of unravelling verse and noble verses. So his saying 'shay'an fariyya' contradicts this station, because 'fariy' is a great thing or a fabricated, manufactured thing. If he said: 'I did not bring a great thing' or 'a fabricated thing', it would not be appropriate. As for 'Sariyy', it is the small river. Whoever held that it is Jesus, peace be upon him, meaning one of the noble people (sarat), he is mistaken. Labid says describing wild donkeys: 'They mediated the width of the stream (sariyy) and split / a filled source, its reeds neighboring.' So Sariyy is the small river. And Masjura is an adjective for the filled spring. How excellent is the saying of Abu al-Miqdam al-Khuza'i from his famous poem in riddles: 'And a stream (sariyyan) I saw amidst people / staying, not wanting to depart from them / Wine is drunk beside it, and their drink / when their mill turns is urine.' Al-Sariyy: The small river, and the context of speech is upon it. The context of the noble Verse indicates the invalidity of the saying of one who said it is a metonymy for Jesus, peace be upon him, because He Almighty said: 'Eat and drink' (kuli wa ishrabi). Meaning: Eat from the fresh dates, and drink from the river. If this is established, I do not know the meaning of his saying 'under my thoughts a stream (sariyya) from the daughters of thoughts.' If he meant what he claimed that Sariyy is Jesus, peace be upon him, he should have said 'Sariyyat' because it is an adjective for 'daughters'. And if the intended is the river, there is no meaning to it. If he said: 'He knows that I filled from that quenching (rayya), and that God has placed under my thought a flow (jaryya) of this type.'\nHe said also after that: 'And he who knows them among them is satisfied with the margins and edges, and content from its pearls with knowing what is in the shells.'\nI say: I do not know what the meaning of this second context is? For there is nothing in shells except pearls. If he said: 'And leaves the pearls and gathers the shells,' it would have been better.\nHe said: 'And if he extracted from it what I extracted, and deduced from it what I deduced, he would wander with it in every valley, and take every provision for walking its path.'\nI say: This last rhyme is dissolved and cold, with no meaning under it. If he said: 'He would wander with it in every valley, and rise for it in the manifestation of hills and descend in the concealing of lowlands,' it would have been better.\n\n**Ibn al-Athir claims creativity in a letter of his condemning Old Age**\nHe said in this chapter: From that is what I mentioned in a chapter of a book containing the blame of gray hair, so I said: 'Life, all life, is in the age of novelty (youth), and what comes after it is only called the age of raggedness. There is no summer resort for pleasure after forty nor a spring. It is the end of the sound strength of the four natures. If a man passes it, the fruits of his life approach their estimation (khars), and his increase becomes like the increase of the diminutive, indicating its decrease. He becomes after that called 'Father' after he was called 'Son'. He wears from gray hair a robe whose train he does not drag in pride, nor is he boastful of it in beauty. If it is said that the best of clothes as a mark is white, it is said: Except this robe, for it is excluded. Suffice it of atrocity that loved ones look at it with the look of a hater. Were it not that fading is after it, the word ignition (ishti'al) would not be borrowed for it. Some people deceive its color with the dye of henna, and that is nothing but mourning for the loss of youth. He is a liar in this act of his, and the familiarity of truth is not hidden from the loneliness of the liar. It is self-deception that it finds solace for its deserted palace and its lofty castle, and going out in a patched garment seems good to it while it sees it with the eye of a new garment.' Then he said: Some of this is taken from the poetry of Ibn al-Rumi. Which is his saying: 'I saw the dye of a man after his greying / as mourning for the prime of youth he wears.' However, in this chapter are many meanings not found in other speech.\n\nI say: He claimed that he invented the meanings in this chapter. I mention verses indicating his speech was taken from them. Abu al-Tayyib said: 'The tool of life is health and youth / so if they turn away from a man, he turns away.' Al-Tihami said also: 'My fresh part of the world is youth and its prime / so if it passes, my desires have passed.' Ibn Abi Hasina said: 'As if the youth climbs a ladder of life / until he passes forty and descends.' Sibt al-Ta'awidhi said: 'Highness of age has broken / my activity with gray hair / How did they name it highness ('uluww) / when it is a start in descent?' Abu al-Tayyib said regarding the meaning that the increase of the diminutive is a decrease: 'And he was a son of an enemy, they multiplied him / he has the Ya's of the letters of Anaysiyan (diminutive of Insan).' And how excellent is the saying of Ibn Qalaqis: 'In the matter of my signature and my affair is a biography / that baffled the tongues of the intelligent eloquent ones / Its increase judged decrease upon it / like the guest when the Nun of the intruder (Dayfan) increased.'",

    "text": "Abu al-Tayyib said: 'When my eye glanced at the whiteness of gray hair / it saw my decrease in my increase.' Ibn Saradar said: 'I did not weep that gray hair arrived, but / I weep because the appointment (of death) approaches / The hair of a youth is his leaves, so if it withers / the branches dry up on its traces.' Ibn Abd Rabbih said: 'If they call you their uncle, then it is / a lineage that increases you in ruin with them.' Abu al-Tayyib said: 'Go far, a distance of whiteness that has no whiteness / You are blacker in my eye than darkness.' Al-Ghazzi said: 'The flower of life weakened and withered / the flower of living is a flower in the back of the head / Hidden from me almost before the ignition of the / head was that fading is in ignition.'\nHe said: From this meaning is my saying also: 'It is taking noble traits from their sky and earth, and undertaking their transfer among people and their imposition. He adorned himself with the names of the months until some of them became envious of others. So Muharram is for the one seeking refuge in his sanctuary (haram), Safar for the one hoping for the endeavor of his foot, Rabi' for the seeker of his gift, and Rajab for the sayings of his scolders.' This is taken from Al-Farazdaq's saying: 'Your two hands: a hand in which is the spring (Rabi') of people / and in the other are the months of the sacred (Haram).' Poets have said much about this, but I managed a management that no one other than me managed.\n\nI say: What management? He did not deny a thing but he became acquainted. People used the names of the months and brought them sweet, sweet, and firmly placed. Like the saying of the poet about a miser: 'He adorned himself with the names of months, so his palm / is Jumada (frozen/dry) and he gathered Al-Muharram (forbidden) upon it.' The other said, excelling in every way: 'A fawn smiling with pearly teeth / rosy-cheeked, beautiful mouth / The blamer blames me for his love / and Sha'ban (the blamer) did not know that I am Rajab (deaf/honored).' The Arabs used to call Sha'ban 'Al-Adhil' (The Blamer) before Islam, and Rajab 'Al-Asamm' (The Deaf). How excellent is the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God have mercy on him: 'God took charge of realizing his intent, purifying his resource, building the structures of his happiness, and immortalizing the dwellings of his sovereignty, until God's gifts are organized for him in twos and ones, and he wears the security of Rajab in Sha'ban and the fertility of Rabi' in Jumada.' And his saying also: 'It is water, except it is Zulal (pure), and magic except it is Halal (lawful), and the fresh Rose except it is far from boredom. The days of standing upon it are days of Eid between the purity of Ramadan and the fertility of Shawwal.' And his saying also returning to the mention of his letter: 'So he prostrated to its niche and submitted (sallam), and counted its lines as smiling mouths (mabsim), and stood upon it the standing of a lover upon the ruins, speaking to it while it does not speak. His eyelid poured rain—and it was Jumada—with his tears, and it was Al-Muharram on his cheek.' And the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk: 'Active of beautiful figure, cheek, and jewelry / why did they claim the beautiful woman is lazy (miksall - rhymes with Shawwal)? / The ignorance of my passion overlooked my piety through her / O Ramadan, Shawwal has overshadowed you.' As for using the names of months as double entendres (Tawriya), among the best is the saying of Judge Muhyiddin Abdullah ibn Abd al-Zahir: 'Beware of denying Ja'far / that imaginary one and his companions / For the Nile of Egypt, how many a Ja'far (stream) / imagined (mukhayyal) does it have coming out of its gate (Bab)?' How ingenious are these two verses and how subtle this imagination. And the saying of Ibn Quzul: 'We have become weary of the water of Tell al-Ujul / and hated hearing he-said and it-was-said / And among the ordeal we are in / is the heat of Tammuz returning (Ab - August/returned) in Aylul.' And the saying of As'ad bin Mamati: 'Magic blew at dawn (Sahar) / and the flowers resembled the stars (Zuhar - Venus) / And the camphor of dew wet / the clothes of the tree leaves / And the nightingale, since seeing / the forbidden (Muharram) of the garden, whistled (Safar - month Safar).' And the saying of Al-Siraj al-Warraq from verses: 'She wanted to extinguish the lamp (Siraj - the poet) / with it, so she doubled its flame / And she contained Tuba (Coptic month/Tree in Paradise) with it, so / our talk among people became its door (Babah - Coptic month).' And the saying of Ibn al-Sa'ati: 'Joseph has a Joseph; if a crisis occurs / he is feared and hoped for, and in his rulings is an Umar / All months are spring (Rabi') from his bounties / where the treasuries of his wealth are zero (Safar).' \n\n**Discussing an example by Ibn al-Athir**\nHe said: From that is what I mentioned in reclaiming affection—and he cited the chapter, and at its end: 'Patience is the best thing used in the estrangement of brothers. And water, if it flows in a place then deviates from it, inevitably it will return to that place.'",

    "text": "I say: I do not know what the meaning of this is. For water, if it deviates from a place, it only deviates due to the lowness of the place to which it deviated compared to the place from which it deviated. Either by a trench dug, or by a collapse of the earth itself. In that case, the water returns backwards and turns away from the high ground, and descends to the low ground. This is what is understood from the word 'water deviated' (inharafa). When the matter is so, water does not return to it, unless he claims that the supply of water strengthens its push so it increases until it rises above the depression, and finds no space to occupy other than that which it deviated from. This is not understood from his mere speech. If he said: 'For rain, if its downpour stops from a place, inevitably it will return at a time to that place.' Or: 'For water, if it shuns the place of its flow at a time, inevitably it will turn back to that place.' Or: 'If its irrigation is cut off from a place,' or what fits that, other than the word 'deviated'. How sweet is the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil: 'Water may return to its watering place, and the star to its rising place.' How excellent is the saying of the poet regarding the meaning of Ibn al-Athir's saying: 'I will be patient, the patience of a free man without power / over patience, but by way of beautification / Perhaps one day mercy will return you / to me, so you meet me with the face of favor.'\n\n**Discussing another example by Ibn al-Athir**\nHe said: From that is what I mentioned in describing wine, which is: 'Wine, the pleasure of its intoxication does not fulfill the distress of its hangover. It is clumsy of fingertips, foul of tongue, and its feminine gender indicates to you that it is among those lacking in intellect and religion. The way of tyranny has been known from it in its rulings; were it not for that, it would not have exclusively claimed the heads for the crime of its feet.' This is better than the saying of the poet, and stranger and subtler, because he said: 'I remembered its ancient grudges when it became / in time trodden by the feet of the pressers / It softened for them until they became intoxicated and it took control / of them, so it shouted among them for revenge.'\n\nI say: As for attributing fingertips, tongue, intellect, and religion to wine, it is strange. Stranger than that is making feet for heads. Stranger than both is his claiming that his speech is subtler, better, and stranger than the poet's saying, while the difference is apparent like the morning. It is as if he wanted to say that the hand of its drinker is clumsy, his tongue foul, and his intellect and religion deficient. If he attributed that to the drinking companion in blaming wine, it would be a defamation of it. But adding limbs, intellect, and religion to it is not permissible except with an extremely far-fetched interpretation. How excellent is the saying of Abu Tammam: 'Clumsy, its bubbles play with minds / like the play of actions (verbs) with names (nouns).' And the saying of the poet: 'Its drinkers described wine that it / contains joy and expels worry / They spoke truth; it fluttered with their minds and religion / Have you seen one lacking religion distressed?' And the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk: 'Your bride, O drinkers, is divorced / even if she tempted every beholder with her beauty / I paid her my wealth and my mind in advance / She said: And the gardens of bliss are my deferred payment.' It is said: Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik handed Nusayb a cup. He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, I only reached you by my mind. If you see fit not to separate between my mind and me, then do so.' And the saying of Al-Siraj al-Warraq: 'The bad omen of the Mother of Vices, wine, is a bad omen / that exceeded the limit, so listen to what is counted / For it has imprisonment in the jars, and for the purifier / crucifixion, and for the drinker lashes.' As for his saying: 'It exclusively claimed the heads for the crime of its feet.' The pronoun must refer either to it or to the heads, and both are not permissible. How excellent is the saying of Ibn Zuhr al-Ishbili: 'Pillowing their cheeks on palms / intoxication assassinated them as it assassinated me / I ceased not giving them drink and drinking their leftovers / until I became drunk and what attained them attained me / The cup knows how to take its revenge / I tilted its vessel so it tilted me.' Abu Tammam said in a poem: 'If the hand attains it with vengeance, it stays dignified / on its grudge until it takes retaliation from the foot / And it wrestles its cupbearer by the equity of its drinking / and wrestles them by tyranny in the form of justice.' As for his saying: 'Its feminine gender indicates to you that it is among those lacking in intellect and religion.' How excellently did Al-Mutanabbi use this in describing the world (Al-Dunya - feminine), saying: 'The character of beautiful women is in it, so I do not know / for this did people feminize its name or not?'",

    "text": "He said: From that is what I mentioned in encouraging travel (lit. Westernization/Estrangement - Tagharrub), which is: 'Were it not for being away (Tagharrub), the daughters of shells (pearls) would not have ascended to the honor of necks, nor would the dust of stones (kohl) have ascended to the light of eyes.' Then he said: Likewise my saying in this meaning, which is: 'In movement is elevation for those of obscure destiny. Were it not for that, the crescent would not have swept the robe of fullness (full moon), and wet aloe-wood is firewood in its homelands, and musk is blood in the navels of its gazelles. Were it not for the arrow separating from its bowstring, it would not have attained the merit of hitting. Were it not for the spear separating from its growing place, it would not have adorned itself with the glory of fingertips nor the honor of the waving cloth. This chapter is a decisive speech in its meaning, and of what thoughts have not found easy to build its structure. Some of it is taken from poetry, and some of it the mind offered without precedent, and it testifies for itself.'\n\nI say: His saying 'ascended' (irtaqat) first, and 'ascended' (irtaqa) second contains a defect due to repetition. If he had said in one of them 'connected' (ittasal) or 'rose' (sama) or otherwise, it would have been better. Likewise 'building its structure' (ibtina' mabnahu); the like of this is criticized in speech. Al-Sahib bin Abbad was criticized for his saying: 'I compose love poetry (ushabbib) but by high traits I compose / and I attribute lineage (ansub) but by glories I attribute / I have a youthful passion but to the presence of highness / and I have a thirst but from glory I drink.' The poem was named 'The Lakin-iyya' (The But-poem) due to the frequency of 'but' (lakin) in it. All these meanings have been circulated by poets and they increased in them. Of that is the saying of Ibn Saradar: 'Shake your mounts in the wilderness / and leave the beautiful women to the palaces / Were it not for being away (tagharrub), the pearls of the seas / would not have ascended to the necks (nuhur).' And the saying of Sibt al-Ta'awidhi: 'They said move away and travel, you will earn honor / for the pearl is not cherished until it separates from the shell.' And the saying of Ibn Qalaqis: 'Travel if you attempt a destiny / the crescent traveled so it became a full moon / And water gains sweetness as it flows / and becomes foul as it settles / And by the movement of precious pearls / a sea was exchanged for a neck.' Ibn Qalaqis and Ibn al-Athir, may God have mercy on them both, were from one era. For Ibn Qalaqis died in 567 AH, and Ibn al-Athir died in 637 AH; Ibn Qalaqis was born in 532 AH, and Ibn al-Athir in 558 AH. So Ibn al-Athir lived longer. The saying of Ibn al-Sa'ati, who is of his era: 'Be dispensed of every land by its sister / and if its dwelling is sweet with large-eyed maidens / For were it not for the separation of pearls from the shells of their sea / a neck and a forehead would have denied them.' And the saying of the poet: 'Lions, were it not for separating from the forest, would not have preyed / and the arrow, were it not for separating from the bow, would not have hit / And gold dust is like soil cast in its places / and aloe-wood in its land is a type of firewood.' And the saying of Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri: 'And the Samhari spear, its value is not honored / until its flexible shaft travels from its forest.' And I said from this material: 'Travel, you will attain the ranks of glories and highness / like the pearl traveled so it became in crowns / And likewise the crescent of the horizon, if it abandoned night-travel / the shame of decrease would not have separated from it.' And I said also: 'Travel, you will attain ranks of pride and highness / for musk of creation is nothing / but blood in the navel of gazelles / And the spear when it separated from the homeland became / with a banner flapping and a crown of a spearhead.'\n\nHe said: From that is what I mentioned in blaming the world (Al-Dunya), which is: 'The miseries of the world are mixed with things souls are created to love. And all that bodies find sweet of foods harms them from the side of their medicine. For this reason, the benefit of Myrobalan (Halilaj) is blamed and the harm of Almond-sweet (Lawzinaj) is blamed. Stranger than that is that a human does not benefit from a thing of its pleasure except it harms him from the side of his reward. He is like one who benefits by warming himself at a fire while it is burning his clothes. A proverb has been coined for that, and it is said that all that benefits the liver is harmful to the spleen.'\n\nI say: Look at this weakness (rakaka) and colloquialism. Do you not see it more resembling the speech of old women, midwives, when they start preaching and striking proverbs? Is this how the world is described in the state of blame? Did he not hear anything of the speech of Ali bin Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, when a man said to him: 'Describe the world for us.' He said: 'What shall I describe of a house whose beginning is suffering, its end is annihilation, its lawful is accountability, and its forbidden is punishment; whoever becomes rich in it is tempted, and whoever becomes poor in it grieves.' Nor anything of some sayings of the wise about it, like the saying of some: 'The world is a hope before you, a term (death) looking down upon you, a tempting devil, and desires dragging the rein; it calls you so you answer, and you hope for it so you are disappointed.' Did he not hear the ascetic poems (Zuhdiyyat) of Abu Nuwas, which include: 'People are nothing but a perishing one and son of a perishing one / and possessor of a lineage rooted in the perishing ones.'",

    "text": "'If a wise man tests the world, it reveals / to him an enemy in the clothes of a friend.' Even Al-Rashid or Al-Ma'mun said: 'If the world described itself, it would not have described with more than the saying of Abu Nuwas.' Did he not hear anything of the sayings of Abu al-Atahiyah, Salih bin Abd al-Quddus, and Mahmud al-Warraq, and those who exposed themselves to blaming it among poets like Al-Mutanabbi and Abu Tammam and others? Did he not hear Al-Zamakhshari's saying: 'You are sweet to them then you pass (tahliyin thumma tamurriyn), and you settle for them then you become bitter (tahullin thumma tamurrin).' The first is from sweetness and passing, and the second from settling and bitterness. Did he not stand upon the letters of Al-Ma'arri in blaming the world? Does he not say in some of his letters: 'If the world were a bride she would have been divorced, but she is a mother who became destitute. Her child loves her despite disobedience, and she turns them away from attaining rights. What is with us and you, O mother of stink (Dafar)? Does the destruction of abundance not satisfy you? You tired me with insolence, so how about with toothlessness? You grieved me as a young woman, so how about as a perishable old woman? Far from it, neither old age nor weariness afflicted you, but that is for your children who drank from your vessel...' It is long, in which he mentioned those who passed away of the notables of nations. It is of the resonant letters. And Ibn al-Shibl al-Baghdadi says: 'We are but between a claw and a fang / of calamities whose lions are training / We wish, and in the wish is shortening of life / so we become as women forgot weaving / Health of the man is a path to sickness / and the path of annihilation is this survival / By that which we are nourished we die and live / The most killing disease for souls is the medicine / What we met of the treachery of a world, may it not be / nor may its taking and giving be / Soles under thunder and mirage / from which a clumsy prostitute sipped / Its generosity returns upon it, so whenever / the morning gives, the evening takes back / Rarely does the soul accompany the body / so why the misery and why the suffering? / May God uglify a pleasure for our misery / attained by mothers and fathers / We, were it not for existence, would not feel pain of loss / so our bringing into existence is a tribulation upon us.' Leave all this. Did he not stand upon the Nubatian Sermons and see his speech in them, and follow his example and recite his recitation, until he says: 'Myrobalan and Almond-sweet and liver and spleen.' People mention the like of this, but they insert it into phrasing that is masculine, having impact on the soul. \n\nHe said: From that is what I mentioned in Asceticism (Zuhd), which is: 'People in the world belong to the current hour, just as souls are not residents in it.'\nI say: I do not know what the meaning of the simile here is, and the face of the relationship in that. For his saying: 'Just as' (kama), the Kaf is for simile, and there is no relation between 'they are sons of the current hour' and 'that they cease/depart'. If he deleted the word 'kama' (just as), the meaning would be straight, because it returns: 'And souls in it are not residents.' Do you not see that some people criticized Abu al-Tayyib for his saying: 'The snows confused my paths for me / so as if they, with their whiteness, are black.' 'And likewise the generous one, if he stays in a town / the gold flows in it and the water stands.' They said: By what thing did he liken the staying of the generous one? What preceded it is not suitable for that. The answer to that: When he said that snows blocked the paths for him so they returned with their whiteness black (in effect), he likened that to the state of the generous one, that solid gold flows due to him and liquid water freezes. This contradiction is like that one. This place is among what is asked about regarding Mutanabbi's poetry.\n\nHe said at the end of this chapter: 'The utmost of a human's requirement is that his life be extended, and he be given respite in the extension of his trace. As for his long life, gray hair opposes it, which is non-existence in existence, and it is the brother of death in everything except inhabiting graves. The limbs by which desires are perceived, you see each of them has changed, and became like the effaced ruin which has no reliance. So Layla is not Layla, nor is Al-Nawar; nor are hearings hearings, nor sights sights.'\n\nI say: This is of that pattern in weakness and ugliness, especially this last part. The dissolution of these words and their fall is not hidden from one who has the slightest alertness and little taste. It is as if he wanted to follow the example of Abu Tammam where he said: 'You are not you, nor are the dwellings dwellings / Passion has dried up and desires have ended.' But where is the soil from the Pleiades, and oh the distance between the back of the neck and the face. From the second half, the benefit of repetition in the first half is known. It is strange that he said in the fourth type regarding emphasizing two pronouns, and cited the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'A tribe, you are you, and you are from them / and your grandfather is Bishr the King, the Gallant.'",

    "text": "I did not cite it choosing it, but I used it as an example to show the emphasis of the detached pronoun with the detached. Otherwise, the verse is not pleasing because its casting is a casting bare of beauty.\n\nI say: I wish I knew what coating is on his own saying: 'So Layla is not Layla...' As for Abu Tammam, he addressed himself like one denying what was of his passion for those dwellings he stood upon after his solace and the passing of his desires. He had the right to say: You are not that one who was first, nor are these dwellings those that were first. Meaning as if his self became other than that one, and the dwellings were changed to another description. How excellent is the saying of Al-Haziri the Paper-merchant: 'I left you, so go to whom you love / for your deed has cooled the fire of passion / And treachery has made you ugly in my eyes / and the wood of love has been left withered / And I have become seeing you with the eye of solace / and I used to see you with the eye of love.' It is known that the eye did not change in its essence, nor was there an eye and it was exchanged for another. Rather, solace necessitated showing him with the eye of ugliness, and love necessitated showing him with the eye of beauty. Of this is the saying of... 'The eye of satisfaction is blunt to every defect / just as the eye of discontent reveals bad deeds.' This circulates on people's tongues. They say about one from whom a trait changes against them: 'It is as if he went and another came.' This from Abu Tammam is the ultimate in beauty in its category.\n\nAs for the saying of Abu al-Tayyib, under it is meaning that clothes it with superior beauty, because this is the most praiseworthy thing for the tribe he mentioned. Because he said: A tribe you are from, and you are you; meaning: What a tribe it is, because you are from them and you are that great one. So he delayed the conjunct from the conjoined like his saying: '... Upon you, and the mercy of God, peace.' Sheikh Taj al-Din al-Kindi estimated it another estimation, and this is better despite the necessity in it. It is as if Ibn al-Athir, may God have mercy on him, glimpsed the meaning of the verses that appeared for some poets of 'Al-Dhakhira' by Ibn Bassam, which are: 'She became a decayed bone / her essential and accidental differentia departed from her / Her animal entity vanished / and her logical expression perished / Her three powers of soul vanished / verily all of that is a hidden matter / And the five senses which were in her / and for their perception was a lively action / All those attributes went / and it is impossible for the eternal to go.' He wanted to bring this meaning but spoiled it, and demolished what this poet brought and built. Some people claim these verses are by the Chief Abu Ali ibn Sina (Avicenna), and Ibn Bassam established them in 'Al-Dhakhira' for a Maghrebi. But the Chief's poem on the Soul which begins: 'A dove descended to you from the highest place / possessing pride and refusal' is the ultimate in beauty, and no one has the like of it in its category, and its fame prevents listing it. The virtuous have cared for it, quintupled it (made takhmis), and explained it. How excellent is his saying when he mentioned it at death: 'It was as if it were a lightning flash that shone in the sanctuary / then folded as if it never flashed.'\n\n**Models of Ibn al-Athir's composition and the discussion around them**\nHe said: From that is what I mentioned in describing speech with eloquence, which is a chapter of a letter, so I said: 'He has the expression (Bayan) which breaks the order of the unique pearl, and the freshness of his new dress does not wear out. It is above glorious speech (kalam majid), and below the Glorious Quran (Quran Majid).' \nI say: We have not seen anyone who praised speech or eulogized it with the like of this. In the arts of praise and types of eulogy there is ample scope away from that. Do you not see that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, is the Master of the Children of Adam. Despite this, I have not heard anyone praise another saying to him: You are below the Prophet, peace be upon him. Because the word 'below' and 'less' and 'under' are not used in the side of the praised one. And the speech of God Almighty, it is established and proven that it is not in the power of humans to bring a Surah like it, so all speech is below it. So his saying: 'Speech below the Glorious Quran' has no meaning under it because it is of the category of acquiring the acquired (tawdih al-wadihat - stating the obvious). The like of this, according to Sheikh Jamal al-Din ibn Malik and those who follow him, is not called speech (Kalam) because it did not provide a complete benefit that was not with the addressee, like your saying: 'The sky is above the earth,' because it is known to everyone. If you say: He meant by that politeness. I say: The field did not narrow on him, nor did the narrowness of the station confine him to this, such that he needs to bring something in which he makes reservations. Nothing threw him into that except the word 'Al-Majid' (The Glorious) and 'Al-Majid', seeking the pun (Jinas).\n\nHe said: And if they abbreviate a description, he said: 'It sways the hearing of the rapture-prone (tarub), and lightens the dignity of hearts, and represents white signs (miracles) without joining to pockets (reference to Moses' hand), and appears in the earth not tired (laghib) when the tribulation of fatigue touches others.'",

    "text": "I say: If it sways the hearing of the rapture-prone (tarub), there is no great praise in this. That is because the form 'fa'ul' is an exaggeration for one who gets enraptured. 'Tarub' is not said except for one who inclines to the slightest pleasure, and moves for the least grace. Like 'akul' (glutton) and 'sharub' (heavy drinker) for one who eats and drinks much of what passes him. If the one who inclines to rapture and repeats that is enraptured by this speech, there is no merit in this necessitating his praise. For this reason it is said: 'One prepared for a thing, the slightest cause suffices him.' Praise is only to say: 'It sways one who does not relax for rapture.' As he said in the second: 'And lightens the dignity of hearts.' For this is what is customary in praise. If you say: This reflects on Al-Buhturi in his saying: 'Swaying the hearing of the suffering rapture-prone / from the songs of Ma'bad and Aqid.' I say: This supports what I said, because he said: It sways the hearing of the suffering rapture-prone *from* listening to Ma'bad and Aqid, who are the origin of singing. If it turns one who is of this description away from his pleasure to hearing it, that is praise; so it is of the category of 'It makes the forbearing light and tempts the ascetic.' This was only pure for Al-Buhturi by his saying: 'from the songs of Ma'bad'. If Ibn al-Athir said: 'It sways the rapture-prone from his songs by his eloquence,' I would not have raised this objection against him. This which I said is what is customary in praise. Do you not see the saying of Al-Nabigha al-Dhubyani: 'If she presented herself to a gray-haired monk / worshipper of the God, celibate, devout / He would gaze at her splendor and the beauty of her talk / and think it guidance though he is not guided.' And the saying of Imru' al-Qais: 'To the like of her the forbearing one gazes with passion / when she grows tall between a shield and a shift.' How excellent is the saying of Kushajim regarding a lute player, from verses: 'His pegs turned in it so they differed / like the difference of hands when clasped / If he moved it behind a defeated one / on a post-horse, he would turn and look back.' And I said: 'She touched the second strings of her lute with fingertips / that toyed with the core of the submissive pious one / And she sang, so if she wished, the sweetness of her word / would have turned the rein of the rushing lightning / And I wondered at the East Wind as it did not stop / in rapture, but it has no ear that hears.'\n\nAs for his saying: 'And appears in the earth not tired (laghib),' I have not heard of anyone praising eloquent speech with the like of this. Speech is not described with fatigue or weariness. But this is of the category of adding intellect, religion, and limbs to wine in the chapter that passed. Did he not know that weariness is of the attributes of bodies and their appendages during movement and its persistence? Speech does not tire; rather the fatigue is for the limb of the one who spoke it, and the book does not tire; rather the writer who wrote it. How excellent is the saying of the poet: 'If he takes the paper he deposits in his scroll / a thicket of flowers or a necklace of jewels / He protected every thought from the wrestling of his reflection / and put down the weight of thinking from the pens.' If Ibn al-Athir intended the writer from whom this letter issued which he described, there is nothing in the context of speech indicating him. Al-Wahid criticized Abu al-Tayyib for his saying: 'All swords, if striking is prolonged with them / weariness touches them other than the sword of the State (Sayf al-Dawla).' He said: Weariness does not attach to swords unless he brought it as a metaphor in the place of dulling of the edge.\n\nHe said: 'When I stood upon it I said: Glory be to Him who gave our master and was not stingy, and singled him out with the prophethood of expression (Nubuwwat al-Bayan) except that he was not sent (as a messenger). Were it not that Revelation has closed its door, it would be said this is a revealed book. God has chosen good for the possessors of eloquence that they did not live in his era, and were not tested with the disease of envy which burns them with the kindling of its ember. If they were safe from that, their sayings were not safe from his sayings which erased them the erasing of ink. They were remaining after him, but when he came they became as they became to the graves.'\n\nI say: In this there is bad etiquette as there is. A human has an alternative to such praise that exits him from these straits. His saying: 'Singled him out with the prophethood of expression except that he was not sent' is taken from the saying of Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri: 'Were it not for the interruption of Revelation after Muhammad / we would have said Muhammad is a substitute for his father / He is like him in merit except that / Gabriel did not come to him with a message.' The sayer of the like of this has disbelieved.\n\nHe said: 'And verily his words have a taste whose flavor is known from among speech, and the lightness of spirits is known from among the heaviness of bodies. If he were not known by his taste, he would be known by his mark, and the morning is not disputed in its shining, nor does it lack proof of its lights. It is known that the root is known by its branch, and the saying is known by its tone.'\nI say: His saying: 'And verily his words have a taste whose flavor is known from among speech,' how excellent is what Ibn Amira ibn al-Abbar answered with regarding a letter sent to him, coming within the answer:",

Do you lower yourself while you have risen, or hide while you have wrapped yourself? We knew you, O Sawdah, and the suit of Utarid (Mercury - scribe of planets) was famous for beauty and quality.' And his saying: 'And the morning is not disputed in its shining,' the two rhymes. Taken from the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'Nothing is correct in understandings / if the day needs proof.' And from the saying of Al-Ghazzi: 'Do not seek proof of his nobilities / your seeking proof of the morning is cold.' And his saying: 'And it is known that the root is known by its branch' is taken from the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'His actions are a lineage, even if he did not say with them / My grandfather is Al-Khasib, we knew the root by the branch.' Although Al-Mutanabbi took it from Al-Buhturi where he says: 'I do not count lineage for a youth / unless his lineage is in his deeds.' I have transferred this meaning to Ghazal, so I said about a beautiful one I saw in a window (taqa): 'I saw in a window a youth like the full moon / so I said who is under this fresh Ban tree (Bana)? / They said you judged while not seeing his stature / I said: I knew the branch by the fruit.'\n\nHe said: 'And the precious things of these necklaces are not revealed except by his breaths; their pearls are his word, and their strings are his paper.' Then he said: From this category is my saying also which is: 'Words like the flapping of banners and the roaring of lions, and meanings indicating by their sharpening that they are the swords and that hearts sheathing them are the scabbards, so the contemplator imagines them a clamor of stabbing or a race track.'\nI say: He did not match in this joint upon the joint. For he likened them to the flapping of banners and the roaring of lions. So what entry is there in these two for 'a race track' afterwards, when horses were not mentioned? Proportion requires saying: 'A clamor of stabbing, a forest of lions, and a duel of knights.' Such descriptions are not in any speech, unless speech containing threat and reprimand or terrifying an enemy or what follows that course is described. Do you not see how excellent is the saying of Al-Buhturi: 'A blame with the tips of rhymes as if it is / a blame with the tips of broken spears.'\n\nThere is no harm in citing some of the speech of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God have mercy on him, in describing incoming correspondence, so you may know, O standing upon these papers, how eulogy should be. Of that is his saying: 'His letter reached me so there reached me from it what reached me (or what connected me), and I knew of his rhetoric what was ignorant of me, and I drank from the sea of his speech what drank me and ate me, and I rose by it in rank although it brought me down from the back of speech. For they are wonders, the secret of rhetoric was not spread before them; and occurrences of a mind whose qualities were clear, so it is what ascended him and clarified him the occurrences; and strange things that became easy and abundant, so sometimes I say the boldness of a source (nab') and sometimes the flow of a spring (nabi'). It contained pearls except that they are words as Abu al-Tayyib said, and revived the living of longing except that as Abu Tammam said if he died from his preoccupation with separation he would not know. So I ransomed its hand having extended a shadow of script that almost shortens a shadow of luck. To God is its pen which grew long and exceeded, so it is as if the cut (of the nib) never diminished it.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'I do not reckon pens were made prostrating except because his scroll is a prayer-niche (Mihrab), nor that they were named mute (khurs) except before our master blew into their panic the wonder of this correctness. Nor that they lay down in their inkwells except for what is blown into them of his spirit in their sleeping place. Nor did their heads turn black except because they are Abbasid flags which the Presence took with its hand. Inevitably they protect the sanctuary, shed blood and spare blood, and the rein is sash-wrapped with them, and he sends them so the knights know that in the book/writers (Kuttab) are knights. And the sermons (Khutaba) stand with what you wrote so tongues know that in hands, just as in mouths, is a tongue. I have wondered at these pens: their tongues are cut so they speak eloquently, and their noses are mutilated by sharpening so they come out sound/correct (Sahiha) and display a beautiful one (Maliha). They are but a sign in the white hand of our master, Mosaic (Musawiyya), and its material in eloquence is Alawid (Alawiyya), and were it not for exaggeration I would say Upper/Heavenly (Uluwwiyya).'\n\nAnd his saying: 'If the magic of expression claimed that it fulfills the easiest of his rights, and bears fruit of what is obligated of thanks for his branches and roots, I would expose the falsehood of its magic, and make it taste the evil outcome of its affair, and crucify the magical thoughts on the trunks of pens, and tie their tongues as magic ties tongues from speech.'",

    "text": "And his saying: 'My noble (Karimi) letter in terms of attributing it to him, my Wounded/Spoken-to (Kalimi - ref Moses) in terms of attributing it to the white hand of his hands; my Messianic (Masihi) in terms that it revived the dead of intimacy; my Muhammadan (Muhammadi) in terms that it almost is, by what he blew into my panic, a Holy Spirit. So may I not lack his address which bestows upon days the day of Eid, and upon nights the night of the wedding. So may God keep him for the Arabic tongue, for were it not for him it would be cornered not narrated, driven away not stored. Were it not for him, its letters would have changed from their states, and Eloquence would have refused that the legs of letters be among its tools. Its standing Alif would sit, and its sleeping Ba would die, and the bending of the back of its Dal would increase until its cheek touches the dust and it lowers, and the teeth of its Sin would fall out until there remains no molar for it to bite on.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'He stood upon it while thanks for the One who bestowed it was not stopping (waqif), rather it dripped (wakaf), and sought rain from it, the downpour of clouds, so it did not cut off for him nor hold back (kaff), and saw a structure of explanation (tibyan); if the competitors saw it, their building would be brought down from the foundations so the roof would fall upon them. To God is he of an eloquent one; if he speaks, speech with him is more abundant than the water of the eye on the day of separation (Bayn), and if another desires speech, it is less with him than the water of the Taff (Karbala) on the day of Hussein.'\n\nAnd his saying in answer to a letter by Sheikh Taj al-Din al-Kindi: 'I thought him—and God realized the thought in him—to have ascended the causes (ropes to heaven) and taken the word from the drops and the paper from the clouds. I believed in the validity of his charm (ruqya), and verified his picking of stars when he brought them in brilliant and pure wording. I said to the group: The speech of the Crown (Taj) is the Crown (Taj) of speech, and kingship is in Kindah, and its pens were swords and its swords are now pens.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'So I stood from it upon the vessel (zarf) of wit (zarf), and the masterpiece of the glance (tarf), and I almost worshipped him from it upon a letter (harf - also edge), and every letter is that letter. Were it not for my fear that Time would notice his place in my heart, and my fear that I define him by his good deed from him so I tempt it (Time) regarding it to lift the burdens of my war, I would have said a saying that lowers the first and last of this industry, and executed among them arrows that a rock of a face would not protect a poet from, nor a shield of armor a writer. They are nothing but signs (verses), each one bigger than its sister, and thoughts provided for on all Fridays if thoughts are given their provisions on their Sabbath.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'Noble letters, their words almost smile, and their meanings speak. Their letters almost become pupils (anasi) for the eye of the traveler (masar), and their lines almost unveil brides having jewelry of vowels and scattering of dots.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'A letter splendid (sani) of meanings, Sin-rhymed (Sini) of rhymes. It is the right of its Sin that Iqbal (approach/prosperity) be pure for it, for the Sin accompanies the verb and purifies it for the future (Istiqbal). This is a horizon where there is no flying except for the eagle and its son, and a sea in which there is no swimming except for one who brings pearls from his mouth and enters the sea in his sleeve. I did not mean by the sea here anything but his noble hand; as for the sea (ocean), I did not mean it.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'The letters of the Assembly—may God refresh its heart and grant its nearness—cease not to be the weapons of his allies against Time if they fear its war. They comfort their hoper, and despair their competitor. The hearing becomes fertile by them, and benefit backs itself by them. Were it not that they change our characters against us and create envy in them, and bind our hands if we undertake competition with a rope of palm-fiber (masad).' \n\nAnd his saying: 'Our master, there is no expression (bayan) after his expression. Between his jaws is a sword, while between the jaws of every human is a tongue. So say, O his pens, for the blades in the scabbards have become mute. And strut, O Taghlib daughter of Wa'il, for preference has been given by the eloquent ones while they are coerced. And the confessor of his merit has succeeded, and he knew that the disbelievers (ungrateful) will not succeed.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'He stood upon the Mim-rhyme (Mimiyya) so the flood (Tufan) of it circulated around him, and life from it was spirit and basil. It is of what a King dictated, if a devil dictates poetry. I wondered at the flow of those rhymes, and saw poets bring what they composed in the narrowness of valleys, while his mind and pen brought what they cast in the vast deserts (fyafi). Every verse of it is a Diwan, just as its sayer is a human ransomed by a thousand humans. Just as his pen is short, its nose was not mutilated except to take the revenge of the pen from the spearhead.'\n\nI say: Mentioning the 'Fyafi' (deserts) in the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, and the beautiful pun he composed in this rhyme: I had written to our Sheikh Hafiz Fath al-Din Muhammad ibn Sayyid al-Nas some verses, and he answered me with verse and prose. Among the prose: 'Nay, that is the lawful healing magic. Nay, those powers (quwa) in the rhymes (qawafi). Nay, those intents (maqasid) that killed (aqsadat) desires in the exiles (manafi).' So I wrote the answer to him, and from it: 'He devoted himself from it to the Kaaba of Rhetoric, so how beautiful is what he spread in my greeting (istilami) and folded in my circumambulation (tawafi). The bird of the heart wanted to rise with the answer, but the strength went from the primaries (qawadim), and hunger (khawa) appeared in the coverts (khawafi).' Returning to the speech of Al-Fadil.",

    "text": "And his saying: 'But the unarmed (A'zal) Simak star withdrew from people, and the people of the high degrees rose and the people of the low level fell. People wasted arrows and you hit the kill-spot with one of them. You are the Thrower (Rami) and other than you is the loving/seeking one (Ra'im). You are the Protector (Hami) and other than you is the hovering one (Ha'im). Your letters are flowers and your books are calyxes. Your pen is the waterer and your thoughts are the clouds. Your saying is held stingily and highly valued. If you said: O horses of pens, ride! you filled the earth with neighing and assault. Meanings rushed to you light and heavy, and announced Hajj among them to consciences on every lean mount and on foot. You are the present one and the unseen is presence. You are the Master and other than you is the chaste/concealed (Hasur). Ears are inclined (Suwar) to what you say in Damascus. If you struck water, sparks would fly; and if you neighbored the rose of the cheek, you would be a neighbor to the violet of the whiskers.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'To God is he of a book like a Surah, every verse (Sign) in it is a prostration (Sajda). He met it with humility as if the pen of the writer is the Rod (of Moses) and his paper is the Cloak.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'These books are but battalions, and these letters are but sharp swords. The lines in them are but boats, and the breath from them is but dust revealing the morning, the revealing of darkness.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'As if its pen was stored for the kingdom weaving its brocade, and a jeweler creating its ornaments. As if it is a prince and speech is its subjects, so it disposes its command and prohibition. As if God Glory be to Him deposited in its mind a cloud and its book a garden, making the pen its water-wheel and the inkwell its pool.'\n\nAnd his saying: 'I was relieved when I drew water—despite the distance of my land—from his cloud, and sheltered the dome of inkwells from his pains with his hair (limamih). He returned the time of Rama to me as it is with its gazelles (aramih), and rose upon me the risings of crescents—are they anything but the clippings (qulama) of his pens (aqlamih)?'\n\nLet this be the last of what I cite for Al-Qadi Al-Fadil of this type, although that is a drop from a basin, and a flower from a garden.\n\n**Suitability of Word to Meaning**\nHe said in a chapter after what passed: 'Two pens of calligraphy were attached to our master, one attributed to ink (midad), and the other attributed to spears (si'ad).'\nI say: As for attributing the pen to ink, it is permissible. As for attributing the other to spears (si'ad), I do not know what it is. For 'Si'ad' are spears that grow straight and do not need straightening. So attributing spears to Si'ad, or Si'ad to spears is of the category of attributing a thing to itself, which is not permissible. Spears are only attributed to flags, or spearheads, or stabbing, just as pens are attributed to ink and writing.\n\nHe said: From that is what I mentioned in describing the pen, so I said: 'God inspired his pen what He inspired the bees, except that they shelter in the rugged place and it shelters in the easy place. It is of its nature to gather from fruits having souls, not having sleeves/calyxes (akmam), and it brings out from its spittle a drink of different taste in which is healing for understandings.'\nI say: His saying 'fruits having souls not having sleeves' is not appropriate, since proportion requires saying: 'having souls not having bodies' or 'having shawls (tayalis) not having sleeves', to match between soul and body, and shawl and sleeve. Then attributing soul to fruit is a matter outside of custom, and it has not been heard of fruit having a soul and fruit not having a soul. If exaggeration in describing the fruit is intended, it is said it is congealed water or embodied air. How excellent is the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'It has fruit indicating to you from it / drinks standing without vessels.'\n\n**Wording and Composition**\nHe said in the first section of the first essay: Likewise His Almighty's saying occurred: 'Verily this is my brother, he has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe (li na'jah wahidah).' The word 'li' (for me/I have) is like the word 'tu'dhi' (harming) and it came in the verse integrated, related to what is after it. If it comes cut off, it does not come fitting, like the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'Wishes end up defeated short of his demand / so he does not say to a thing: would that that were mine (layta dhalika li).'\nI say: What did he deny of this word? What he mentioned is but a mere claim. This word 'li' has fallen firmly placed. The rhyme, if it comes firmly placed, is of good composition and sweet flow. As for the word 'tu'dhi' in his saying: 'Manhood is sweet to him while it harms (tu'dhi),' it came weak, unlike 'li' in the mentioned verse. This is not criticized in this verse, unless the word 'bi' (with me/in me) is criticized in his saying: 'I visit them while the blackness of night intercedes for me (li) / and I turn back while the whiteness of morning incites against me (bi).' I have not seen anyone who criticized this verse or this rhyme; rather it is counted among the beauties unique to Abu al-Tayyib, because of the correspondence of five to five in it. This number did not happen for another. Likewise the word 'tu'dhi' which he criticized, if it fell as a rhyme firmly placed, would not be criticized. How excellent is the saying of Sheikh Majd al-Din ibn al-Zahir al-Irbili: 'My heart and my glance, this flows blood and that / is short of creation, You are All-Knowing of its wound (qarhih) / They are two witnesses to Your love, but / the modification (ta'dil - legal credibility) of each is in its wounding (jarhih) / The heart is Your old dwelling, so if You find / in it other than You of creation, then remove him (nahhih).' Look at this third rhyme, how sweet and firmly placed; no other stands in its place. If it fell in other than the rhyme, it would not have this sweetness and mastery. Likewise the word 'li' in Abu al-Tayyib's saying. Of this mastery in rhyme is the saying of Ibn Abi Hilal al-Qayrawani from verses: 'He guides to highness, so there is no traveler / the roads of highness except he was his guide (dalilah) / He surpassed creation in merit until if / it was said who is the unique one of creation? It would be said: It is he (huwah).' How excellent is Al-Qadi Al-Fadil's use, may God have mercy on him, of the word 'li' in rhyme where he said: 'I praised the People of the House (Ahl al-Bayt) among you with what / men bore witness that that verse (Bayt) is mine (li).'\n\n**Is Surah Al-Najm rhymed on the letter Ya?**\nHe said in this section: The talk digressed to His Almighty's saying: 'That, then, is an unfair division (qismatun diza).' That Surah Al-Najm is rhymed on the letter Ya.\nI say: Consideration in the heads of verses (qara'in) and rhymes is not by the written form, but by the pronunciation. The Surah is rhymed on the Alif Maqsura. But he was deceived by the drawing of the verse heads with Ya, looking at the origin of the word. No one says that 'sughra' and 'kubra' and 'diza' and 'ma'wa' and 'muntaha' and the like, if occurring in verse heads or poetic rhyme, are on the letter Ya. Rather, all that is of the category of Alif Maqsura like 'hubla' and 'dunya'. It was only written with Ya looking at the origin of the word being from those with Ya. For you say: Al-Ma'wa from 'awaytu', and Al-Muntaha from 'intahaytu', and Hawa from 'hawaytu', and Ghawa from 'ghawaytu'. If the origin of the word is Waw, it is written with Alif. Like 'dunya' because it is from 'danawtu', and 'raja' from 'rajawtu' in one of the two views. Some claimed that is to avoid combining two likes. I do not think Ibn al-Athir, may God have mercy on him, was ignorant of this, but it is negligence, nothing else.",

    "text": "'They are two witnesses to your love, but / the credibility of each lies in its wounding / The heart is your old home, so if you find / anyone other than yourself in it among creation, remove him.' Look at this third rhyme (nahhih - remove him), how sweet and firmly placed it is; no other word could stand in its place. If it had fallen elsewhere than in the rhyme, it would not have had this sweetness and mastery. The same applies to the word 'li' (mine/for me) in the saying of Abu al-Tayyib. Of this mastery in rhyme is the saying of Ibn Abi Hilal al-Qayrawani in verses: 'He guides to the heights, so there is no traveler / of the paths of highness unless he was his guide / He surpassed creation in merit until, verily / if it were said: Who is the unique one of creation? It would be said: It is He (Huwah).'

The Surah is rhymed on the Alif Maqsura. However, he was deceived by the drawing of the verse-heads with 'Ya' in view of the origin of the word. No one says that 'sughra', 'kubra', 'diza', 'ma'wa', 'muntaha', and the like, if occurring in verse-heads or poetic rhyme, are on the letter Ya. Rather, all of that is of the category of Alif Maqsura like 'hubla' and 'dunya'. It was written with Ya only in view of the word's origin being from roots with Ya. For you say: Al-Ma'wa from 'awaytu', and Al-Muntaha from 'intahaytu', and Hawa from 'hawaytu', and Ghawa from 'ghawaytu'. If the origin of the word is Waw, it is written with Alif, like 'dunya' because it is from 'danawtu', and 'raja' from 'rajawtu' in one of the two opinions. Some claimed that [the spelling] is to dislike combining two likes. I do not think Ibn al-Athir, may God have mercy on him, was ignorant of this, but it is negligence and nothing else.\n\n**Appropriateness of Word to Meaning and Models of Ibn Nubata's Sermons**\nHe said also in this section, citing the saying of Al-Farazdaq: 'Were it not for shyness, I would have increased your head with a wound / which, if probed, its sides would remain boiling / A shaggy (sharanbatha), gray-haired woman; whoever sees what is in her / resembles [her], even between the five-span stature and the child.' He said: 'Sharanbatha' is among the words whose usage is permissible in poetry, and it is not detestable here, except that if it appeared in prose speech of a letter or sermon, that would be criticized in its user.\nI say: A few lines before this, he cited the saying of Ta'abbata Sharra: 'He remains in a wasteland and spends the evening in another / lonely (jahishan) and riding bareback the backs of the paths.' He said: The word 'jahishan' is of the objectionable, ugly words. It is said to him: Glory be to God, the time is not old (i.e., you just said it), your statement contradicted itself in one page. I see that 'jahishan' is lighter on the hearing than 'sharanbatha'. If this 'sharanbatha' appeared in the Nile it would muddy it, and turn its sweet Euphrates water to salty bitter and change it. If it were a mole on the cheek of the sun it would uglify it, and cancel its beauties which illuminated the days and adorned them.\n\nHe said: It appeared in the sermons of Sheikh Al-Khatib Ibn Nubata, like his saying in a sermon mentioning the terrors of Resurrection: 'Its evil intensified (iqmatarra) and its punishment rose high (ishmakharra), so it was neither pleasant nor palatable.'\nI say: Al-Khatib, may God have mercy on him, is among the eloquent rhetoricians who place speech in its proper places and give every station what it deserves. Because mentioning the Fire and the Resurrection is a terrifying matter and requires grandiose words that horrify the hearing, make tears flow, make skins shiver, and break livers. Nothing fits the descriptions of the Fire other than these words like: iqmatarra (intensified), ishmakharra (rose high), isbatarra (extended), izba'arra (bristled), ikfaharra (became dark/grim), iqsha'arra (shuddered), ibdha'arra (panicked), itlakhmma (became murky), idlahamma (became dark), iqtahama (intruded), and ihtadama (raged).\n\n**Topics and Words**\nJust as descriptions of Paradise have words specific to them, sweet, easy, and delightful to the hearing. Like: its breeze softened, its bliss lasted, its shade fluttered, its cool water cleared, and its Tasnim (fountain) was sweet. Do you not see that Praise (Madih) has words specific to it, and Satire (Hija') has words specific to it? So the head (ra's) and the parting of hair (farq) are mentioned in praise, while the brain (dimagh) and the back of the neck (qadhal) are mentioned in satire. Abu Zubayd al-Ta'i's description of the lion in the presence of the Companions in the assembly of Uthman, may God be pleased with him, supports this speech. Among what he said was:",

    "text": "'For his mucus membranes there is a snoring sound, for his chest a wheezing, for his glance a flash, and for his wrists a cracking sound. It is as if he treads on dry stalks or steps on severed trees. Suddenly, a head like a shield, a cheek like a whetstone, and two red-hot eyes as if they are two lamps being lit. A neck thick and fleshy, a dewlap flabby, withers high like a saddle-frame, a chest broad and hairless, a humerus twisted, a forearm strong, and a hand rough of claws leading to talons like hooks. He struck with his hand and raised dust, bared his teeth and revealed fangs like pickaxes, polished not blunt, and a wide mouth like a piercing cave. Then he stretched and pointed with his hands, then spurred his hips with his legs until his length became double. Then he sat on his hind legs and shuddered, then stood and frowned, then scowled and bristled. By the One whose House is in the sky, we did not fear him except for the first brother of ours from Fazara, huge of slaughter-build. He (the lion) broke his neck then killed him on the spot, then shook him a shake that crushed his back and ripped his belly, and began lapping his blood. I incited my companions, but after hesitation they advanced, so we yelled at him. He attacked, shuddering with a mane as if it were a yearling porcupine, and snatched a man from among us, thick and pot-bellied, then shook him a shake that caused his joints to separate. Then he growled and rumbled, then exhaled and babbled, then roared and gargled, then glanced. By God, I imagined lightning flying from under his eyelids to his left and right. Hands trembled, legs knocked together, ribs creaked, ears buzzed, backs touched (in fear), eyes stared, thoughts worsened, and backs slumped. Then he strutted and circled, then stared and gazed sharply. Behold, he had red-hot eyes like the glow of sparks, as if they were chipped by chisels from the side of a stone. His color is rosy, his roar is thunder, his forehead is great, and his head is grim. If you faced him you would say he is armored, and if you turned your back you would say he is restraining. When the night darkens, he seeks and senses. His terror is severe, his evil is stubborn, and his good is distant. When he divides, he oppresses; when he duels, he smashes; when he attains, he acts unjustly.' Then he recited:\n'Frowning, stubborn, proud, arrogant / Bold against enemies, a conqueror of the peer / His claws are rough and his eyes in the darkness / are like the ember of Ghadha wood, evil flying in his face / He indicates with sharp fangs, as if they are / daggers when the wide mouth retracts from them.'\nThe narrator said: One of those present broke wind. Uthman, may God be pleased with him, said to him: 'Hush, may God break your mouth, for you have terrified the Muslims.'\nLook at these words and their impact on the soul; they are like lions devouring or snakes swallowing. Is it appropriate for any of them to be in the description of a gazelle or a peacock? No. I wonder at him that the like of this was hidden from him.\n\n**Appropriateness of Word to Rhyme (Saj')**\nHe said in the first type regarding Rhymed Prose (Saj'): From that is what I wrote in answer to a letter concerning the running away of a slave boy. I said: 'As for the noble indication regarding the matter of the slave boy escaping from service, the foal (muhr) may flee from his fodder, and the moth may fly into his fire.'\nI say: As for the moth, it is not appropriate to say about it: 'It *may* (qad) fly into its fire.' For 'qad' here is for minimization (taqlil), like 'The steed may stumble.' As he said: 'And the foal may flee from his fodder.' As for the moth, it does not see fire except it throws itself into it. This is the norm. It is not so for the foal, for the norm in its case is that if it sees fodder it comes to it, and rarely does it flee from it. Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri said describing a lion: 'He appeared, so he called the moth with his eyes / just as the two kindlers of darkness call it.'\n\n**Discussion on a meaning Ibn al-Athir erred in within his composition**\nAs for coordinating affirmation with negation, it is not permissible in the like of this. It is better to say: 'The foal may flee from his fodder, and the man may distance himself from his brother.'\nHe said, mentioning the investiture (taqlid) he cited in opposition to Al-Sabi regarding the Syndicate of Ashraaf: 'After this (Amma ba'd), every speech that is not begun with the praise of God is cut off (ajdham), and every book not marked with His name is not known (mu'lam). Based on this, His praise descends in speech to the station of limbs in the body, and His name descends in the book to the station of embroidery in clothes. We have combined in this book of ours between Naming (Basmala) and Praising (Hamdala), and made one of them a key for blessing and the other a cause for increase. Then We followed them with prayer (Salat) upon our Master Muhammad whom God supported with the Glorious Quran, and made his testimony before every witness, and upon his family and companions who were guided to the good of speech, and guided to a praiseworthy path.'\n\n**Return to Beginning with Praise**",

    "text": "I say: He claimed that he praised God and mentioned His name, and prayed upon the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and upon his family. Yet, no praising issued from him, nor mention of God's name—unless it was in the beginning of the investiture 'In the name of God the Most Gracious the Most Merciful'—nor prayer. Because if you say 'Praising God is obligatory, and mentioning His name is desirable, and praying upon His Messenger and upon his family and companions is designated,' you have not performed praise, nor mentioning of the name, nor prayer. You only informed about the praise being obligatory, the mention being desirable, and the prayer being designated. Similar to this is if you said: 'Glory be to God the number of birds' feathers, and Praise be to God the number of ocean waves,' you have not brought a glorification and praise equivalent to those two numbers and equal to them. The meaning of this is from your saying: 'God deserves of praises and glorification the number of that.' The like of these things must be guarded against, otherwise there is room for challenging him.\n\n**Divisions of Tasri' (Internal Rhyme in the first verse)**\nHe said, having mentioned Tasri' and divided it into seven sections: He made the first [rank] what each hemistich is independent in itself, and exemplified it by the saying of Imru' al-Qais: 'Afatim mahlan ba'da hadha at-tadalluli...' (O Fatima, gently, some of this coquetry...) the verse. He made the second rank that the first hemistich be independent in itself not needing the one following it, but if the one following it comes, it is linked to it. He exemplified it with the saying of Imru' al-Qais: 'Qifa nabki min dhikra habibin wa manzili...' (Halt, let us weep from the memory of a lover and a dwelling...) the verse. He made the third rank that the poet is chosen to place each hemistich in the place of its brother. He exemplified it with the saying of Ibn Hajjaj al-Baghdadi: 'Min shurut al-sabuh fi al-mahrajan / khiffat al-shurb ma' khuluww al-makan' (Among the conditions of the morning drink in the festival / is lightness of the drink with the emptiness of the place). For this verse, its first hemistich can be made second, and its second hemistich first. This is like the second rank in quality.\n\nI say: This third rank is more worthy to be the first than the first he mentioned, because the like of this type is rarer than the first, and in it is an indication of the poet's mastery and the quality of his nature. Of this has come from Al-Ghazzi: 'Lawla tadhakkur ma taqadama 'ahduhu / ma raja'a al-qalba al-mudallaha wajduhu' (Were it not for remembering what its time has passed / his passion would not have returned to the bewildered heart). And likewise his saying also: 'Dhahaba al-siba fa-tanaqqabi aw fa-isfiri / la hazza fiki li-dhi qadhalin musfiri' (Youth has gone, so veil or unveil / there is no luck in you for one of bared graying head). And for Ibn Qalaqis al-Iskandari: 'Al-haya min ghuyuthik al-bariqat / wal-jana min usulik al-basiqat' (Rain is from your flashing clouds / and harvest is from your tall roots). And likewise his saying also: 'Addid wa da' dhikr al-tasabi 'addid / ya ghafilan 'amma yarahu fi al-ghad' (Count and leave the mention of youthful passion, count / O one heedless of what he sees in the morrow). And for Ibn al-Sa'ati: 'Ma kuntu bil-baki wala al-mutabaki / lawla waqa'i' tarfik al-fattaki' (I would not be crying nor feigning crying / were it not for the battles of your lethal glance). And likewise his saying also: 'Billahi ya rusul al-riyah / kayfa al-sabil ila janah' (By God, O messengers of the winds / how is the way to a wing/Janah?). Do you not see that every verse of these verses contains what is in the one he made first and an increase? So it is more worthy of precedence. It is conditioned in it that every hemistich of it be independent in itself, not needing the other, with the possibility of making the beginning an end and the end a beginning. Ibn Abi al-Hadid critiqued him in the division of Tasri' in his book but did not notice this.\n\n**His discussion on Jinas (Paronomasia/Pun)**\nHe said regarding Jinas: The second section of what resembles Jinas is that the words be equal in weight, different in composition by one letter only. Then he exemplified it with His Almighty's saying: 'Wujuhun yawma'idhin nadirah, ila rabbiha nazirah' (Faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord). And he exemplified with His Almighty's saying: 'Wa hum yanhawna 'anhu wa yan'awna 'anhu' (And they forbid it and distance themselves from it). Then he said: And in a manner like this occurred his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: 'Al-Khayl ma'qud bi-nawasiha al-Khayr' (Horses, goodness is tied to their forelocks). And the saying of Abu Tammam: 'Yamudduna min aydin 'awasin 'awasim / tasulu bi-asyafin qawadin qawadib' (They extend resisting, protecting hands / attacking with destroying, cutting swords). And the saying of Al-Buhturi: 'Min kulli saji al-tarf aghyada ajyada / wa muhafhaf al-kashhayn ahwa ahwar' (Of every languid-eyed, soft-necked, long-necked one / and slim-waisted, dark-lipped, intense-black-eyed one). Then he said: Likewise his saying: 'Shawajir armahin tuqatti' baynaha / shawajir arhamin malumin qatu'uha' (Intersecting spears cutting between them / intersecting wombs (kinship) whose cutter is blamed).\n\nI say: He started the division by stating the words must be equal in weight and different in composition by *one letter*. Nothing of the examples he mentioned holds true to this except His Almighty's saying: 'Wa hum yanhawna 'anhu' the verse, and His Almighty's saying: 'Wujuhun yawma'idhin nadirah' the verse, and the Hadith he mentioned. As for ''awasin' and ''awasim', and 'qawadin' and 'qawadib', one of the two words exceeded the other by a letter and did not just differ. Likewise 'arham' and 'armah', one word differed from the other by two letters in order/arrangement. So what he stipulated was missed, and this has no entry into what he mentioned. Ibn Abi al-Hadid raised objections against him in Jinas regarding things but did not notice this. Ibn al-Athir confused matters in Jinas greatly and did not improve its arrangement.",

    "text": "I have written a book on that and named it 'Jinan al-Jinas' (The Gardens of Puns), in which I divided Jinas into what division was possible, coming to nearly sixty sections. Whoever wants the editing of Jinas in its sections, let him stand upon it there.\n\n**Reversed Jinas (Al-Jinas Al-Ma'kus)**\nHe said: The fourth section of what resembles Jinas is called the Reversed (Al-Ma'kus). Then he cited: 'Adat al-sadat sadat al-'adat' (The habits of masters are the masters of habits), and 'Shiyam al-ahrar ahrar al-shiyam' (The characters of the free are the free-est of characters), and what resembles that, and cited many things for himself and others.\n\nI say: This type has no entry into the chapter of Jinas. It is from the chapter of 'Returning the ends to the beginnings' (Radd al-a'jaz 'ala al-sudur), which is a chapter independent in itself. Among the best that came in it is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: 'Jar al-dar ahaqqu bi-dar al-jar' (The neighbor of the house is more entitled to the house of the neighbor). And the saying of Al-Arjani: 'Shibtu ana wa iltaha habibi / hatta bi-raghmi salawtu 'anhu / ibyadda dhaka al-sawad minni / wa iswadda dhaka al-bayad minhu' (I turned gray and my beloved grew a beard / until against my will I found solace from him / That blackness turned white from me / and that whiteness turned black from him). And the saying of Afif al-Din al-Tilimsani, which has extra craftsmanship: 'Ya bi-abi ma'atif wa a'yun / yasulu minha ramih wa nabil / fa-hadhihi dhawabil nawadir / wa hadhihi nawazir dhawabil' (Oh, may my father be ransomed for curves and eyes / from which attack a lancer and an archer / For these are lean [spears] that are fresh / and these are looks that are lean/languid). Do you not see that 'dhawabil' and 'nawadir' in the first are other than 'dhawabil' and 'nawazir' in the second? If Ibn al-Athir counted the like of this in the chapter of Jinas, that would be a correct statement. For the words agreed and the meanings differed. Among what I said regarding that: 'Ada'a nuski 'idhar misk / fa-kayfa tarki lihaz turki / tanka siham al-jufun minhu / wa muqlati la tazal tabki / qada 'ala admu'i bi-safkin / yaqdi biha fi dami bi-safki / wa shakka qalbi bi-rumh qaddin / qadda fu'adi bi-ghayr shakki' (A musk-like cheek-hair wasted my piety / so how can I leave the glance of my Turk? / The arrows of eyelids hurt from him / and my eye ceases not to weep / He decreed shedding for my tears / judging by them regarding my blood with shedding / And he pierced my heart with the spear of a figure / that cut my heart without doubt). So 'Shakk' (pierced) and 'Qadd' (figure) in the first are other than 'Shakk' (doubt) and 'Qadd' (cut) in the second. Among what I composed in a pattern other than this: 'Qad faqa ghusn al-naqa habibi / wa akhjal al-badr fi al-tamam / dhaka qawam bi-la muhayya / wa dha muhayya bi-la qawam' (My beloved surpassed the branch of the sandy hill / and shamed the full moon in perfection / That is a stature without a face / and this is a face without a stature). It is said: A petition was raised to Al-Qadi Al-Fadil with the name of two muezzins to be employed, one named Murtada and the other Ziyada. He wrote upon it: 'Amma Ziyada fa-Murtada, wa amma Murtada fa-ziyada' (As for Ziyada, he is accepted/Murtada; and as for Murtada, he is excess/Ziyada). So he employed Ziyada and dismissed Murtada. This is the ultimate in beauty.\n\n**The 'Shielded' Jinas (Al-Jinas Al-Mujannab)**\nHe said in the fifth section resembling Jinas, called Al-Mujannab. Then he began citing evidence for that with the poet's saying: 'Aba al-Abbas la tahsab bi-anni / li-shaybi min hula al-ash'ar 'ari / fa-li tab'un ka-salsalin ma'inin / zulalin min dhura al-ahjar jari / idha ma akat al-adwar zandan / fa-li zandun 'ala al-adwar wari' (O Abu al-Abbas, do not think that I / due to my gray hair am naked of the ornaments of poetry / For I have a nature like flowing fresh water / pure, running from the peaks of stones / If cycles blunt a fire-stick / I have a fire-stick striking fire upon the cycles). Then he said: This section has a point of view for me, because it is closer to 'Luzum ma la yalzam' (Requiring what is not required) than to Jinas. He began to explain that with things he was arbitrary in.\n\nI say: The correct view is that this is one of the sections of Jinas. It is the type called 'Al-Muzdawij' (The Paired). 'Requiring what is not required' is a chapter tied to itself, having no entry in this, nor this in it. For 'Luzum' is that the poet or writer brings in the rhyme a letter or more before the rhyme letter (Rawi), committing to the occurrence of that in every rhyme. As occurred in Al-Ma'arri's saying: 'La tatlubanna bi-alatin laka rutbatan / qalam al-baligh bi-ghayr hazzin mighzal / sakana al-simakan al-sama' kilahuma / hadha lahu rumhun wa hadha a'zal' (Do not seek a rank by a tool you have / the pen of the eloquent without luck is a spindle / The two Simak stars inhabited the sky, both of them / this one has a spear and this one is unarmed). For Al-Ma'arri committed to the Zay before the Rawi which is the Lam. If he had said with that: 'mu'awwal', 'awwal', and 'afdal', the rhyme would be valid, but the occurrence of the Zay is 'Requiring what is not required'. And as you say: Al-Hamam, Al-Ghamam, Al-Tamam, Al-Kamam. Or: Al-Budur, Al-Sudur, or Al-Shudhur, Al-Nudhur. For the Mim, Dal, and Dhal are 'Requiring what is not required'. It is permissible that you say with Al-Hamam: Al-Salam; and with Al-Budur: Al-Qubur; and with Al-Shudhur: Al-Harur. On this condition Al-Ma'arri built his 'Luzumiyyat' from beginning to end. As for what Ibn al-Athir cited, it was not so, because before the first Alif is 'Ayn, the second Jim, and the third Waw. So the Luzum is missed. Of what happened to me on the pattern of Abu al-Fath al-Busti: 'Tadhakkartu 'ayshan marra hulwan bikum fa-hal / li-ayyamina tilka al-dhawahib wahib / wa ma insarafat amal nafsi li-ghayrikum / wa la ana 'an hadhi al-ragha'ib gha'ib / sa-asbiru karhan fi al-hawa ghayr ta'i'in / la'alla zamani bi-al-haba'ib ayib' (I remembered a life that passed sweet with you, so is there / for those days of ours gone a giver? / My soul's hopes did not turn to other than you / nor am I from these desires absent / I will be patient unwillingly in love, not obedient / perhaps my time with the loved ones is returning). And I said also: 'Bi-nafsi man idha iddakara ikti'abi / wa anni la ara al-awzar zara / yabit wa lil-tuqa haras 'alayhi / wa li fa-idha ra'a al-ashar hara' (By my soul is one who, if he remembers my depression / and that I do not see the burdens, he visits / He spends the night while piety has a guard on him / and I [spend it], so if he sees the magic times, he is bewildered).",

    "text": "'Wa li qalbun idha iddakara al-zaman al / ladhi nilna bihi al-awtar tara' (And I have a heart that if it remembers the time / in which we attained desires, it flies). And I said also: 'In anta asbahta rabba amrin / fa-la tu'irhu libas bas / wa in tamadat bika al-amani / la tu'irha min qiyas yas' (If you become the master of a matter / do not lend it the clothing of misery / And if wishes go far with you / do not lend them the measure of despair).\n\n**Requiring What is Not Required (Luzum Ma La Yalzam)**\nHe said in the fourth type regarding 'Luzum ma la yalzam': From that is what I mentioned in the midst of a letter containing the blame of a coward, so I said: 'If a calamity befalls him, fright possesses him (malakahu al-faraq), and if he goes astray in a matter he does not believe/feel safe unless drowning overtakes him (adrakahu al-gharaq).'\nI say: In the second rhyme there is a lack of correspondence (mutabaqa). Misguidance (Dalal) is only opposed by Guidance (Huda), and Faith/Safety (Iman) is only opposed by Disbelief/Fear (Kufr). It should be said in that: 'If he denies a blessing he does not believe, and if he strays in a matter he is not guided.' This is among the counted defects. Abu al-Tayyib was criticized for his saying: 'Nazartu ila al-ladhina ara mulukan / ka-annaka mustaqimun fi mahal' (I looked at those I consider kings / as if you are straight in an absurdity/impossibility). This was in the presence of Sayf al-Dawla. It was said to him: Straight is only opposed by Crooked, and the craft requires you to say: 'As if you are straight in crookedness.' Sayf al-Dawla said to him: 'If the rhyme was ending in Jim, how would you have done in the second verse?' Abu al-Tayyib said without hesitation: 'I would say: Fa-in tufuq al-anam wa anta minhum / fa-inna al-misk ba'd dam al-dajaj (If you surpass people while being of them / then musk is some of the blood of chickens).' His quick wit was admired. However, this happened to Al-Mutanabbi often in his poetry. Of that is his saying: 'Wa li-kull 'ayn qurratun fi qurbihi / hatta ka-anna maghibahu al-aqdha' (Every eye has coolness in his nearness / until as if his absence is specks/motes). Coolness is only opposed by heat/warmth, and the speck is opposed by clearing/polishing. And his saying: 'Wa lam ya'zum li-naqsin kana fihi / wa lam yazal al-amir wa lan yazala' (He did not become great due to a deficiency that was in him / and the Prince ceased not nor will cease). Greatness is opposed by insignificance, and deficiency is opposed by completeness or perfection. And his saying: 'Wa innahu al-mushir 'alayka fi bi-dallatin / fa-al-hurr mumtahan bi-awlad al-zina' (And he is the one advising you in error / for the freeborn is tested by the sons of adultery). The freeborn is opposed by the slave/mean. Although interpretation is possible for Abu al-Tayyib in these and their likes, it is better for them to be as I mentioned. This type is frequent in his poetry.\n\n**Discussion on a meaning Ibn al-Athir erred in within his composition**\nAs for Ibn al-Athir, may God Almighty have mercy on him, bringing two rhymes whose Luzum (constraint) is of the lightest possible, and counting them as Luzum and citing them in his book from his speech—this is strange. Even if the whole letter from beginning to end was with the Luzum of Ra before Qaf, it would not be a big deal. Did he not see the book 'Al-Luzumiyyat' by Abu al-Ala, which is a large volume composed on the letters of the alphabet? Did he not see the 'Maqamat al-Tamimiyyah', which are fifty Maqamas composed by Al-Saraqusti, constrained (malzumah) from beginning to end? Sheikh Sharaf al-Din Abd al-Aziz, Sheikh of the Sheikhs, has collected a good part of his poetry in the chapter of Luzum, bringing in it the meters of Prosody and their variations, and the poetry is the ultimate in beauty, subtlety of composition, quality of meanings, and delicacy of words. Of that is his saying: 'Mutayyam wadda fi 'aynayhi law khaba'ak / madha yadiruka law 'arraftahu naba'ak / in aththarat muqlati fi wajnatayka fa-qad / naka'ta qalbi biha ad'af ma naka'ak / admayta khaddayka idh admayta li kabidi / ansif wa qul li tura bi-al-sharri man bada'ak' (An enslaved lover wished he could hide you in his eyes / what would harm you if you informed him of your news? / If my eye left a mark on your cheeks, then / you have reopened the wound of my heart with them double what it wounded you / You bled your cheeks when you bled my liver for me / be fair and tell me, do you see who began with evil?). From it: 'Qad qultu lil-sajf lamma an hujibta bihi / ya sajf laytaka qad akhfayta li rasha'ak / wa ya munamnam khatti 'aridayhi la-qad / qara'ka muhjatahu al-'ani wa ma qara'ak / wa anta ya man yusamini ila sharafi / laqad wasi'ta idhan ad'afa ma mala'ak / hadha wa sarhuka yar'a fi hima kala'i / fa-la ra'a sarhaka al-Bari wa la kala'ak / qul ma bada laka min lu'min li-dhi karamin / fa-law nabahta tuwal al-dahr ma khasa'ak' (I said to the curtain when you were veiled by it / O curtain, would that you hid my fawn for me / O decorated one of the script of his whiskers, indeed / the suffering one read his soul to you while he did not read you / And you, O one who rivals me in my honor / you have contained then double what filled you / This, while your flock grazes in the sanctuary of my pasture / so may the Creator not tend your flock nor protect you / Say what appears to you of meanness to one of generosity / for even if you barked all time, he would not shoo you away). Look at the subtlety of this composition and its flow, and these rhymes and their firmness in their places. How sweet they are in their locations! If you isolated them from their composition, they would not have this beauty. How strong is their composition in their structure itself, yet they are not, in isolation, sweet to the hearing. Here the ability of the composer appears. How sweet is his saying: 'So may the Creator not tend your flock nor protect you.' Then Ibn al-Athir, may God have mercy on him, cited after those two rhymes something else from his speech, rhyme by rhyme also, like: 'babih wa ighbabih', 'ardan wa ardan', 'anzaltuhu wa hawwaltuhu', 'atrafiha wa atrafiha', 'suknah wa yumnah'. That is not of the rare beauty. As came in the speech of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God Almighty have mercy on him, in his saying: 'And the favoring (in'am) which is the reality (haqiqa) and what is other than it is metaphor (majaz); and the merit (fadl) and decision (fasl) which arrived with elaboration (ishab) and brevity (ijaz); and the beautiful deed immortalizing mention, for it is the fulfillment (tanjiz) of the promise of immortality even if metaphor (injaz - poetic license/metaphor) is permitted in it.'",

    "text": "And in his saying: 'I knew favoring by the robes of honor (khila'), and whoever guarantees in the stations of debate the folding of its tongue (tayy lisan), the Kingdom guarantees for him that he struts in its shawl (taylasan), and settles him from the blackness of robes in the robe of its pupil (insan).' And in his saying describing a night: 'In a night like the waves of the sea, having stars like the bubbles of the river (nahr), and it has gathered worries and mobilized (hashad) them, and guided their strays and recited (anshad) them. So I say when it stretches its back (sulb): May God cut your back (sulb), and when will I see the pillar of dawn while God has hastened crucifixion (salb) upon it.' And in his saying: 'I ascended the peak of forty and did not leave the peak of twenty, and said to the soul: Nissan (April) made me forget what Tishrin (October/November) is to Tishrin.' And in his saying: 'His saying made me lonely: I sent the letter seeking and asking permission (musta'dhina), and how do you see regarding a group I sought with rights for our master (ustadhina); and I found the wind of his letter and the spirit of his nearness, so we returned to the custom ('adah) and our days returned ('adat), and we turned to the best and our speech softened, and we revisited desires (muna) and they did not cross the mind, and if they crossed, they are all wishful thinking (kullu muna).' Such is Luzum when beautiful, and such are the eloquent tongued, not what Ibn al-Athir brought of bad dates (hashaf), and drove of the lean which the hearing rejected and did not sip. \n\nI happened to compose verses with double rhyme (thuna), there is no harm in establishing some of them here. I said: 'Ad'uka ya mujid al-ashya' min 'adami / wa sani' al-'alam al-'ulwi wa al-ardi / in kunta ta'ridu yawm al-hashr li 'amalan / fa-la tuqaddir lahu tulan 'ala 'ardi' (I call You, O Originator of things from non-existence / and Maker of the upper and lower world / If You present a deed for me on the Day of Gathering / do not estimate for it a length against my honor/'ard). And I said also: 'Ya sahiban dhayal al-siba fi al-hawa / ablaytahu fi al-ghayy wa huwa al-qashib / faghsil bi-dam' al-'ayn thawb al-tuqa / wa naqqihi min qabl 'asr al-mashib' (O dragger of the tail of youth in passion / you wore it out in error while it was new / So wash with the tear of the eye the garment of piety / and clean it before the age of gray hair). And I said also: 'Wajadtu fi 'ishrat sahbi adhan / lamma lazimtu al-bayt fi al-waqt zal / ya 'ajaban min ash'ariyyin ghada / yahmadu ra'y al-nas fi al-i'tizal' (I found harm in the company of my friends / when I stuck to the house immediately it vanished / Oh wonder at an Ash'ari who became / praising the opinion of people regarding withdrawal/Mu'tazilism). And I said also: 'Inna al-latafa lam tazal / 'inda al-akabir fashiyah / a-ra'ayta 'umraka fi al-wara / tarfan raqiq al-hashiyah' (Verily subtlety ceases not / to be spreading among the great ones / Have you seen in your life among people / a periphery/companion (tarf) thin of margin/nature?). And I said also: 'La tar'a lil-mallaq 'ahdan wa la / tusghi li-ma nammaqahu wa ikhtalaq / fa-anta tadri ma janathu yadu al-r / rami 'ala al-tayr bi-ra'y al-malaq' (Do not observe a covenant for the flatterer nor / listen to what he embellished and fabricated / For you know what the hand of the archer committed / against the bird by grazing the flatterer/valerian). And I said also: 'Atani wa qad awda al-suhad bi-naziri / yumazziq junh al-layl bariqu fihi / fa-qultu lahu ya tayyib al-asl hakadha / akhadhta al-kara minni wa 'ayni fihi' (He came to me while sleeplessness had destroyed my eye / the lightning of his mouth tearing the wing of night / I said to him: O one of good origin, like this / you took sleep from me while my eye was on/in it). And I said also: 'Inna 'ayni mudh ghaba shakhsuka 'anha / ya'mur al-suhd fi karaha wa yanha / bi-dumu'in ka-annahunna al-ghawadi / la tasal ma jara 'ala al-khadd minha' (My eye, since your person was absent from it / sleeplessness commands and forbids regarding its sleep / With tears as if they are morning clouds / do not ask what ran/occurred on the cheek from them). And I said also: 'Faddaytu habiban darraj al-husn wajhahu / fa-sabba 'ala khaddayhi dhawb 'aqiq / idha 'ayana al-rawd al-mudabbaj khaddahu / yaqul lana hadha akhi wa shaqiqi' (I ransomed a beloved whose face beauty reddened / so it poured melted agate on his cheeks / If the brocaded garden sees his cheek / it says to us: This is my brother and my full brother/anemone). And I said also: 'Anfaqtu kanz mada'ihi fi thaghrihi / wa jama'tu fihi li-kull ma'na sharid / wa talabtu minhu jaza' dhalik qublatan / fa-aba wa raha taghazzuli fi al-barid' (I spent the treasure of my praises on his mouth / and gathered in it every fleeing meaning / And I asked him for a kiss as a reward for that / but he refused, and my flirtation went in the cold/post). And I said also: 'Waqafa al-qadib li-qaddihi lamma masha / wa jarat dumu' al-'ayn fi tahsilihi / rasha kasahu al-husn minhu hullatan / ja'at bi-jumlayiha 'ala tafsilihi' (The branch stood for his figure when he walked / and the tears of the eye flowed in acquiring him / A fawn whom beauty clothed from him a suit / that came in its sum according to its detail/tailoring). And I said also: 'Qalu wa qad madat bi-ghusn al-naqa / asrafta fi al-hubb bi-la fa'idah / fa-qultu manhum al-hawa lam yakun / yashba' in ladhdhat lahu al-ma'idah' (They said, while she swayed with the branch of the dune / You have exceeded in love without benefit / So I said: The glutton of passion is not / satisfied if the table is sweet to him). And I said also: 'Lamma tana'aytum 'ankum / ma zala 'anni 'ana'i / wa law qafaltum ilaykum / fatahtu bab al-hana'i' (When you distanced yourselves from you / my suffering did not cease from me / And if you returned (locked) to you / I would have opened the door of happiness). And I said also: 'Kun kayfa shi'ta fa-inna qad / raka qad ghala 'indi wa 'azza / mata al-suluww ta'ish an / t ama ra'ayta al-sabr 'azza' (Be how you wish, for your / value has become high with me and dear / Solace died, may you live / Did you not see patience give condolences?). And I said also: 'Lahu fi khaddihi ayat husn / wa laysa li-'aqdiha fi al-hubb faskh / wa rayhan al-'idhar lahu hawash / 'ala narin lahuma bi-al-ruh taskhu' (He has in his cheek signs of beauty / and there is no annulment for their contract in love / And the basil of the cheek-hair has margins / upon a fire for which they are generous with the spirit). And I said also: 'Ya 'ajaban min ma'shar sukruhum / athbatahum fi 'alam al-mahw / wa kull ka's shamsuha ashraqat / wa yawmuhum 'arin min al-sahw' (Oh wonder at a group whose drunkenness / established them in the world of erasure / And every cup, its sun shone / and their day is naked of sobriety/cloudless). And I said also: 'Rasha'un sara bi-qalbi / wa ana ashkuru sayrah / fa-saba sabri lamma / lam yajid al-qalb ghayrah' (A fawn traveled with my heart / and I thank his journey / So he captured my patience when / the heart did not find other than him/jealousy). \n\nI say: I did not establish these verses for the Luzum (constraint) in them necessarily, for that only came in them implicitly and consequently. Rather, I established them for the Tawriya (double entendre) in them. That is apparent to one who contemplates their places.",

    "text": "And I wrote upon the arrival of the cavalcade of our master the Sultan—may God immortalize his reign—from the Noble Hijaz in the year 733 AH to our master the King of Princes in the Guarded Damascus—may God strengthen his victories: 'May God double the blessing of the High Presence and gladden him with what perfumed existence of the news of his Sultan, and delight him with the return of his King after attaining his desires (awtar) to his homelands (awtan), and fill his hearing with what filled the heart of Islam with joy until its well (qalib) overflowed with happiness without its ropes (ashtan). This correspondence issued to the High Presence folding upon a peace (salam) that the full moon seeks refuge from its decrease by its perfection, and spreading a praise (thana') for which the dove danced with its cooing on the sides of its branches, and clarifying to his noble knowledge that we wrote it after the arrival of our Noble Cavalcade to the seat of his kingdom at the Citadel of the Mountain which we settled its dwelling, and illuminated its horizon with the light of our Noble Face. It was like ambiguous words, but when we analyzed/settled (halalna) it, its meaning appeared. We arrived at it while it was more longing for us than withered gardens for clouds, and more fond than one yearning for the breezes of the sanctuary and the cooing of doves, and more looking forward than the night traveler in darkness for the rising of the full moon. So we adorned its sky, cleared its darkness, moistened the thirst of its longings, and untied the hand of loneliness that had taken hold of its collars. This while Victory is the guest of the side of our leading horses (jana'ib), and Triumph is the servant of the stirrup of our mounts (raka'ib), and Happiness travels before us, and Existence calls us with support from all directions. The lightnings have sent in the horizons the kindnesses of good news perfumed, and the saints (Awliya) have surrounded our cavalcade so our preceding favors did not fall short of them when we saw them sworn (muhallafa/allied). We have performed, by God's praise and grace, the rituals of Hajj, and raised our voice with the Call (Nida) and our palms with dew (Nada), so people saw how the clamor ('Ajj) is, and how the pouring (Thajj) of rain is. We breathed from our night travel with the fire of lightning while the charcoal of darkness was in flames. We turned from Mecca—may God honor it—to Medina—may God cherish it—so we did not march from a Sanctuary (Haram) except to a Sanctuary (Haram). So we attained by God Almighty's grace what we wished (ammana) and hoped (ammalna), and performed the trust (Amana) to longing in enjoying the Noble Chamber just as we carried it. We spoke directly to that Noble Station with peace (Salam) upon arrival at the Request (Sul), and were alone with him so there was no messenger (Rasul) between us and the Messenger. Let the High Presence take his share of this glad tiding by which Islam rejoiced, and the sides of pulpits swayed for it, and the fingertips of flags counted its gifts, and even the mouths of inkwells spoke its praises with the tongues of pens. Let him not burden the subjects in this glad tiding with anything, so that the nearness (Qurba) is innocent of impurities, empty of defects, for thunderbolts muddy the generosity of clouds, and boredom spoils the connection of loved ones. May God keep the Presence for a happiness whose melodious tunes we hear, and a praise for which the sides of scrolls sway and the tongues of pens chant in the hands of Arabizing writers by His grace and generosity.' Most of what I compose, I bring it constrained (Malzum), and the sermon (Khutba) of this book is constrained.\n\nHe said in Luzum also: It has appeared for the Arabs some of that. Of what came of it is the saying of some of them in the verses of Al-Hamasa: 'Inna allati za'amat fu'adaka mllaha / khalaqat hawaka kama khalaqat hawa laha' (Verily she who claimed your heart bored her / created your love just as she created love for her) and he cited the famous verses.\nI say: This is not of Luzum in anything. The rhyme is the Lam and the Ha is a connection (Sila). Do you not see that if he said in some of its rhymes: 'aqarraha' or 'asammaha', that would not be permissible. This type is frequent in Arab poetry and is not Luzum, like the saying of Kuthayyir Azza: 'Khalilayya hadha rab'u 'Azzata fa'qila / qalusaykuma thumma inzila haythu hallat' (O my two friends, this is the quarter of Azza, so hobble / your two young camels then descend where she settled). It is a long poem, the rhyme in it is the Lam. And the verses of Al-Hamasa by Amr bin Ma'di Yakrib: 'Wa lamma ra'aytu al-khayla zawran ka-annaha / jidalu zar'in ursilat fasbatarrat' (And when I saw the horses tilting as if they were / stalks of crops sent/released so they straightened). The rhyme in it is the Ra. Although Ibn al-Athir made it of the chapter of Luzum, and this is closer to Luzum than the first. If he had cited this and claimed it was Luzum, he would have had some semblance of an argument. For Abu Tammam and others consider the rhyme here to be the Ta. Abu Tammam composed a Ta-rhymed poem (Ta'iyya) on this. Which is: 'Nusa'iluha ayya al-mawatini hallat / wa ayya diyarin awtanatha wa ayyat' (We ask her which homelands she settled / and which dwellings she inhabited and where). Likewise the Ta'iyya of Sharaf al-Din ibn al-Farid, the Poem of the Way (Nazm al-Suluk), and the other short one. But the verifiers do not permit that and criticize it. The verses of Salma bin Rabi'a, the poet of Al-Hamasa: 'Hallat Tumadiru ghurbatan fa-htallat / faljan wa ahluka bi-al-liwa fa-l-hallat' (Tumadir settled in estrangement so she occupied / Falj, while your family is at Al-Liwa, strictly/then the Basket). Long verses where he made the rhyme nothing but the Lam. Likewise the saying of Sulayman bin Qutayba al-Adawi from the poets of Al-Hamasa: 'Marartu 'ala abyati ali Muhammadin / fa-lam araha ka-'ahdiha yawma hallat' (I passed by the houses of the family of Muhammad / and did not see them as I knew them the day she settled). In Al-Hamasa there is much of this type. As for the verses of Al-Hamasa: 'Wa harbin yadijju al-qawmu min nafyaniha / dajija al-jimali al-jillati al-dabirat' (And a war from whose spray the people clamor / the clamor of great sore-backed camels), it is of the chapter of Luzum. As for the ones Ibn al-Athir cited, no.",

    "text": "So it is from the chapter of Luzum, whereas the ones Ibn al-Athir cited are not.\nHe said: Some have mentioned in this type what appeared in the verses of Al-Hamasa. Which is: 'Wa fishatin laysat ka-hadhi al-fish'. Then he cited the verses and said: This is not from the chapter of Luzum. He began to deduce the correctness of his claim, either with something erred in, or something whose correctness was hidden from him. I say: These verses are from the chapter of Luzum, evidenced by the fact that if he said in them 'hush', it would be permissible. As for his reasoning with 'arsh' (throne) and 'taysh' (recklessness), it is not conceded to him. Waw and Ya occur as 'Ridf' (letter before the rhyme letter) just as you say: 'qusur' and 'qasir', and 'kusur' and 'kasir'. This is more famous and apparent than to need citation.\n\nHe said in Luzum also: Know that if the last word of poetry or rhymed prose intervals is made diminutive (tasghir), then that is attached to Luzum. Then he cited the poet's saying: 'Azza 'ala Layla bi-dhi sudayr / su'u mabiti laylata al-ghumayr' (It was hard on Layla at Dhu Sudayr / the badness of my overnight stay the night of Al-Ghumayr). He cited it to the end. \nI say: That is not of Luzum. For 'timra', 'zahra', 'sadra', 'sahra', 'matra', and 'qamra'—if all their words are un-diminutive, there is no Luzum in them. Yes, if the rhymes he mentioned were 'qumayra', 'ghumayra', 'umayra', 'jumayra', 'sumayra', and 'numayra', that would be counted as Luzum due to the presence of the Mim. The composer does not burden himself with the like of what he cited, nor bind himself to anything; rather, every Ra-rhyme or non-Ba-rhyme can be made diminutive. Among the wonders of this man, may God have mercy on him, is that he counts the like of this as Luzum, then says two lines later: 'Perhaps some ignorant people fall into this place and insert into it what is not of it. Like His Almighty's saying: 'Inna al-muttaqina fi jannatin wa na'im. Fikihina bima atahum rabbuhum wa waqahum rabbuhum 'adhaba al-jahim.' (Verily the righteous are in gardens and bliss. Enjoying what their Lord gave them, and their Lord protected them from the punishment of Hellfire). This does not enter into the chapter of Luzum, because the origin in it is 'ni'am' and 'jahim'. And the Ya is of the letters of extension and softness.'\n\nI say: Of natural speech is the saying of the poet: 'Law arada Allahu khayran / wa salahan li-muhibbih / naqala riqqata khadday / hi ila qaswati qalbih' (If God wanted good / and righteousness for His lover / He would have transferred the softness of his cheeks / to the hardness of his heart). Likewise this man, had God guided him in this station, his speech here would have transferred him to what he mentioned of the Diminutive, and he would have said: 'The Ya here is for Diminutive so there is no consideration for it because the origin is: 'sadar' and 'ghamar' in 'sudayr' and 'ghumayr'.' However, I have wasted these two verses I cited here as an example, for they are nobler than such. Nothing is said here except: 'May I be your ransom, do not commit adultery and do not give charity.' As for the noble Verses he cited, they are of the chapter of Luzum. For it is permissible in Rhymed Prose (Saj') to say: 'samum' and 'hamim', combining Waw and Ya as preceded. As for 'jahim', 'na'im', and 'hamim', it is of the chapter of Luzum. He confused this chapter just as he confused Jinas. Although Luzum ma la yalzam and Jinas are of the clear Badi' (Embellishment), and whoever occupied himself with that would notice them in the beginnings due to their clarity. I wondered at Ibn Abi al-Hadid that he did not notice these things.\n\n**When is the word 'Khawd' (delicate woman) beautiful or ugly?**\nHe said in the sixth type regarding the difference of word forms and their agreement, after mentioning the word 'Khawd' and that it is: 'In the noun which is 'khawd', it is beautiful and pleasing, but if it comes in the form of the verb it is not pleasing.' Then he cited the saying of Abu Tammam: 'Wa ila bani Abd al-Karim tawahqat / ratka al-na'ami ra'a al-tariqa fa-khawwada' (And to the Banu Abd al-Karim they rushed / the trot of the ostrich that saw the path and hurried/khawwada). And the verse of Al-Hamasa: 'Aqulu li-nafsi hina khawwada ra'luha / ruwaydaki lamma tushfiqi hina mushfiqi' (I say to my soul when its chicks hurried/khawwada / Gently, you have not feared when it is time to fear). Then he judged the first as heavy and ugly, and the second as light and beautiful. He argued for this that it appeared here by rule of metaphor (majaz), and there by rule of reality (haqiqa).\n\nI say: How abundant is this man's arbitrariness and his claims without support. Even if it were, it is weaker than a house founded on the brink of a crumbling cliff. That is because from the beginning of the book to its end, he argues that the sweetness of a word and its beauty is a matter returning to the composition of its letters and the pleasure of its location in the hearing, and that this is a matter attested to by sense (hiss). It is said to him: If the matter is so, there is no consideration here for meaning. If meaning affected the word with sweetness, 'harkulah' for a woman trembling in limbs and buttocks would be sweet. And if meaning affected the word with weakness, the word 'sa'ir' (blaze) and 'hayf' (injustice) would be heavy to the hearing. Since sweetness and heaviness do not relate to meaning, we know that meaning has no account in eloquence. In that case, his saying: 'Khawd' in the first is heavy because it is reality, and in the second is beautiful because it is metaphor, is a mere claim. Because the Kha, the stressed Waw, and the Dal did not change form or structure in the two places. Metaphor and Reality are two semantic matters having no relation to the word.",

    "text": "It is said to him: You said: 'The explanations grammarians burden themselves with are weak and do not stand on the touchstone of observation.' Is this explanation you brought strong, standing on the touchstone of observation, having no defect or blemish? 'Is this the stabbing of one who cures thirst / and the advance of a man who criticized men!'\n\n**Is the word 'Immah' (Leadership) with Kasra eloquent?**\nHe said also in this chapter, having mentioned 'Immah' with Kasra on the Hamza: 'I saw the author of the book Al-Fasih mentioning it among what he chose of eloquent words. Oh, would that I knew what he saw of its eloquence.' Then he increased in degrading him and did much of that.\nI say: Abu al-Abbas Tha'lab, may God have mercy on him, mentioned that only adhering to its occurrence for the sake of the chapter he convened for that. He said: 'Chapter of the vowel-broken beginning (Maksur awwaluhu), and the vowel-joined (Madmum) with difference of meaning.' So he was compelled to mention it and mention its likes: of 'Khitba', 'Sifr', 'Rihla', and 'Ishra', adhering to the occurrence of what came in that. The broken might be sweeter, and the joined might be sweeter. The Imams of language, if they say 'eloquent' (fasih), do not necessarily mean sweetness and beauty; rather they mean frequency of usage. Sweetness might come after that implicitly and consequently. Therefore, you hear them saying: The correct language in 'Zi'baq' (Mercury) and 'Zi'bir' (Nap of cloth) is Hamza (glottal stop) without easing (tashil), even though easing is lighter and sweeter than Hamza, so the 'Fasih' is Hamza. Likewise their saying 'Sam'u' (Hearing) with moving the Mim is more eloquent than stillness (Sam'c), yet sense testifies that stillness is lighter and better. So every sweet thing is eloquent, but not the reverse.\n\nHe said regarding that also: 'Likewise Fa'ula with Fatha on Fa and Damma on 'Ayn has only one noun [participle] which is Fa'il, and no difference occurs in it except what is anomalous. But Fa'ila with Fatha on Fa and Kasra on 'Ayn, difference occurs in its active participle (ism fa'il) in approval and disapproval because it has three weights: Fa'il, Fa'il, and Fa'lan. You say from it: Hamida fahuwa Hamid and Hamdan.'\n\nI say: Verily Fa'ula with Damma on 'Ayn, its active participle is not restricted to Fa'il. Rather it may come on Fa'al. Like 'Jabuna fahuwa Jaban' (Cowardly), and 'Hasunat al-mar'ah fahiya Hasan' (Chaste). It may come on Fa'al with moving the 'Ayn, like 'Batula fahuwa Batal' (Hero) and 'Hasuna fahuwa Hasan' (Beautiful). It may come on Fual with Damma on Fa like 'Furata al-ma' fahuwa Furat' (Sweet water), and 'Dakhuma fahuwa Dukham' (Huge), and 'Shaju'a fahuwa Shuja'' (Brave). It may come on Fa'ul like 'Hasurat... Hasur', and 'Azzat fahiya 'Azuz'. It may come on Fa'il like 'Hamuda... Hamid' (Sour). It may come on Fa'r like 'Ghamura... Ghamr' (Inexperienced), and 'Saluba... Salb' (Hard). It may come on Fa'il like 'Nadusa... Nadis' (Intelligent) and 'Yaquza... Yaqiz' (Alert). It may come on Fa'l with stillness on 'Ayn like 'Dakhuma... Dakhm', 'Sahula... Sahl', 'Sa'uba... Sa'b', 'Shahuma... Shahm'. As for if it is of the verbs of inherent qualities (Sajaya) like Zarufa, Sharafa, 'Azuma, Kabura, then its active participle is on the weight of Fa'il; you say in that: Zarif, Sharif, 'Azim, Kabir.\n\nAs for Fa'ila with Kasra on 'Ayn, he released the expression and claimed its active participle comes on three weights: Fa'il, Fa'il, and Fa'lan. The rule in that is that the verb is not devoid of three forms: Fa'ala with Fatha on 'Ayn like Daraba, Fa'ila with Kasra on 'Ayn like 'Alima, and Fa'ula with Damma on 'Ayn like Zarufa. As for the first, its active participle is regular (muttarid) in analogy on Fa'il, like Daraba... Darib, Dhahaba... Dhahib, Ghalaba... Ghalib, Naqasa... Naqis, Kamula... Kamil [Note: Kamula is usually u, Kamil is for a/u]. As for the second, Fa'ila with Kasra on 'Ayn, its active participle on Fa'il is heard (sama'i), one does not exceed that transmission, and analogy has no entry in that. Like your saying: Amina... Amin, Salima... Salim, Sakhita... Sakhit, Radiya... Radin. As for the regularity of the active participle of Fa'ila on Fa'il, it is if it is intransitive, which is the verb of accidental state ('arad) that is unstable. Like your saying: Fariha... Farih (Happy), Gharitha... Gharith (Hungry), Batira... Batir, Ashira... Ashir; this is regular. If it is transitive as Ibn al-Athir mentioned in Hamida, its active participle is not regular on Fa'il. As for 'Hamid' (on Fa'il pattern), I never heard it. I think Ibn Khalawayh in the book 'Laysa' said: 'There is nothing among nouns built on three names like: Rahima... Rahim, Rahim, Rahman, except Salima... Salim, Salim, Salman, and Nadima... Nadim, Nadim, Nadman.' It is said: He claimed the like of this in the assembly of Sayf al-Dawla bin Hamdan, and this rule was mentioned while Ibn Khalawayh was present. He said: 'One remains from the lineage of the Prince, which is Hamida... Hamid, Hamid, Hamdan.' This is among the beauties of Ibn Khalawayh. Had 'Hamid' (on Fa'il pattern) been among its agents, it would have been mentioned at that time. If Fa'ila is of verbs of colors and defects, its active participle is on Af'al, like 'Awira... A'war, Hawila... Ahwal, Jahira... Ajhar, Kadira... Akdar. Likewise Khadira, Sawida, Safira—whenever it is of colors, its active participle is Af'al.",

    "text": "As for if Fa'ila is for fullness and heat of the belly, it is Fa'lan with stillness on the 'Ayn, like: Shabi'a... Shab'an, 'Atisha... 'Atshan, Sadiya... Sadiyan, Rawiya... Rayyan, Sakira... Sakran. As for the third, Fa'ula with Damma on 'Ayn, discussion on its active participle has preceded. This is the rule regarding the structures of active participles from the three forms, not what he claimed and released.\n\n**Regarding Verbal Complexity (Mu'azala Lafziyya)**\nHe said regarding Verbal Complexity: From that is some of them: 'Wa qabru Harbin bi-makanin qafr / wa laysa qurba qabri Harbin qabr' (And the grave of Harb is in a desolate place / and there is no grave near the grave of Harb). These Qafs and Ras are like a chain in their succession, and there is no hiding the heaviness in that. Similarly, the saying of Al-Hariri in his Maqamat occurred: 'Wa izwarra man kana lahu za'iran / wa 'afa 'afi al-'urfi 'irfanahu' (And he turned away who was a visitor to him / and the seeker of favor loathed knowing him/his favor).\nI say: As for the verse he mentioned first, he is excused in it, and all masters of Meanings and Bayan mentioned it and stipulated it, but did not couple it with Al-Hariri's saying. This is of his arbitrariness and obstinacy. For Al-Hariri's verse has nothing but an abundance of Jinas (puns), and this is a craft, so how does he count it a defect? If it were so, every Jinas repeated in a verse or paragraph would be complexity according to his view, but it is not so. If he had glimpsed the secret in the heaviness of that [first] verse, he would not have coupled it with Al-Hariri's saying. The cause of heaviness in that verse is not the repetition of letters necessarily, for that is part of the cause, but rather it is the advancing of letters over one another, with repetition in his saying: 'qurba qabr'. So much so that this verse became famous such that intelligent people are tested by reciting it three times consecutively in one breath, and hardly anyone is safe from stumbling in it. The cause of that is advancing some letters over others and delaying them. This is not specific to this verse, but to everything whose letters repeated advanced and delayed. Ibn Sana' al-Mulk, among the smoothest of late poets in poetry and subtlest, has the like of this in his saying: 'Wasaftuki wa al-lahi yu'anidu bi-al-'adhal / fa-kuntu Aba Dharrin wa kana Aba Jahl / lahu shahida zurin min al-nahyi wa al-nuha / 'alayki wa min 'aynayki li shahida 'adl / habibatu hadha al-qalbi min qabli khalqihi / yuhibbuki qalbi qabla khalqiki bal qabli' (I described you while the blamer opposes with blame / so I was Abu Dharr and he was Abu Jahl / He has two witnesses of falsehood from prohibition and intellect / against you, and from your eyes I have two just witnesses / Beloved of this heart from before its creation / my heart loves you before your creation, nay before me). Look at the first two verses, how smooth they are, and how heavy this third is. What is its cause other than advancing letters sometimes and delaying them sometimes in 'qabli' and 'qalbi', 'qalb' and 'qabl'. As for Al-Hariri's verse, it has nothing but the repetition of the letters of its Jinas, and advancing and delaying are non-existent in it. Do you not see that 'Ayn is before Fa in both times, and 'Ayn is before Ra, and Ra is before Fa in both times? This is apparent. Sharaf al-Din ibn al-Farid, may God have mercy on him, in his Ta'iyya brings Jinas in the verse often repeated, like his saying: 'Aya zajiran humra al-awrak tarika al / mawarik min akwariha ka-al-arikah' (O driver of the red-hipped [camels], leaving the / pads of their saddles like the couch). It does not contain the entanglement and heaviness on the tongue as in his saying: 'Wa la hilma li fi hamli ma fika nalani / yu'addi li-hamdi aw li-madhi mawaddati / wa 'adi da'awi al-qili wa al-qali wanju min / 'awadi da'awi sidquha qasdu sum'ati / wa kallaftuha la bal kafaltu qiyamaha / bi-taklifiha hatta kafaltu bi-kulfati' (I have no forbearance in bearing what attained me regarding you / leading to my praise or praising my affection / And oppose the claims of hate and the hater, and escape from / the consequences of claims whose truth is intending my reputation / And I burdened it, nay I guaranteed its standing / by burdening it until I guaranteed with my trouble). What is the cause of that other than advancing letters in this sometimes, and delaying them sometimes, and listing them in order in the first without advancing and delaying? So know that. I do not deny that excessive Jinas repeated in a verse or paragraph is not free of some heaviness. I only disputed him in making Al-Hariri's saying of the category of the verse that is like a scorpion's charm or some spiritual incantations. People have frequently cited it as evidence and it became a proverb in the anxiety of words.\n\nDeepening words (taq'ir) is known and people have mentioned it. Of that is that Isa bin Umar the Grammarian or Abu Alqama the Grammarian fell from his donkey and fainted. When he woke up and saw people gathering around him, he said: 'Ma lakum taka'ka'tum 'alayya taka'ku'akum 'ala dhi jinnah, ifranqi'u 'anni yarhamukum Allah' (Why have you gathered/taka'ka'tum upon me like your gathering upon a possessed man? Disperse/ifranqi'u from me, may God have mercy on you). One of them said: 'Leave him, for his Jinn speaks in Hindi.' And of that is the news of Umm al-Haytham with the woman who complained to her of pain in her back. She asked her the cause. She said: 'Kuntu wahma bi-dakkah, fa-hadartu ma'dubah, fa-akaltu hayzabah min firas hal'ah fa-i'taratni zalkhah.' She replied: 'Innaki la-dhatu khuza'balat.' (You are full of nonsense/riddles). The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'The most hated of you to me are the garrulous (thartharun), the pompous (mutafayhiqun), the affectatious (mutashaddiqun).' All these words refer to those who are pedantic in speech. Tharthar is from 'ayn tharthara' if its water is abundant; Mutafayhiq is from 'tafayhaqa al-ghadir' if it overflows; and Mutashaddiq is one who opens his jaw corners wide.\n\n**Types of Complexity**",

    "text": "He said regarding Complexity (Mu'azala): The fifth section of Complexity is that multiple adjectives occur in one manner. Like the saying of Abu Tammam—and he recited verses for him including: 'Tamikuhu nahduhu mudakhiluhu / malmumuhu muhza'illuhu ajaduh' (Its height, its rise, its interweaving / its gathering, its bounding, its firmness). Then he said: This verse is of the complexity that pulls teeth.\nI say: The heaviness of the verse is not from the multiplicity of adjectives, but from his saying 'tamikuhu' and 'muhza'illuhu'. Multiplicity of adjectives itself contains no heaviness or complexity if they come with sweet words. As you say if describing a stature: 'Qawimuhu, ahyafuhu, na'imuhu, ladnuhu, rayyanuhu' (Its straightness, its slimness, its softness, its flexibility, its lushness). If you delete the Ha (suffix), it increases in beauty. Like the saying of Judge Shams al-Din Ahmad ibn Khallikan: 'Qasaman bi-wajhika wa huwa badrun tali'un / wa bi-layli turratika allati ka-al-ghayhabi / wa bi-qamatin laka ka-al-qadib rakibtu fi / akhatiriha fi al-hubb as'aba markabi / wa yutibu mabsimaka al-shahiyya al-barida al / 'adhba al-namira al-lu'lu'iyya al-ashnaba' (An oath by your face which is a rising full moon / and by the night of your lock which is like darkness / And by a stature of yours like a branch, I rode in / risking for it in love the hardest mount / And your appetizing, cold, sweet / pure, pearly, cool mouth is good). Among what I said in this type: 'Qasaman bi-nadir qaddika al-ladn al-qawi / m al-ahyaf al-muta'attif al-rayyani / wa bi-jafniya al-dami al-qarih al-hami' al / hami al-mulithth al-hatil al-hattani / ma li 'ala dhull al-jafa sabrun wa la / jaldun yusa'iduni 'ala al-hijrani' (An oath by the freshness of your flexible, straight / slim, bending, lush figure / And by my bloody, wounded, shedding / pouring, persistent, raining, pouring eyelid / I have no patience over the humiliation of estrangement nor / endurance to help me with abandonment). Sense judges between us and one who claims this is of the chapter of Verbal Complexity. As for Abu Tammam's verse, it is from a poem in which two like it occurred: 'Marinuhu ladnuhu muthaqqafuhu / 'arrasuhu fi al-akuffi mashashuhu / muttariduh' Then he said: 'Musaffuhu tharruhu musahhihuhu / wabiluhu mustahilluhu baraduh'.\n\nHe said, having cited the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'Fa-la yubrimu al-amr alladhi huwa halil / wa la yahlulu al-amr alladhi huwa yubrim' (He does not settle the matter which is dissolving / nor dissolve the matter which is settling).\n\n**Refuting Partisanship**\nIt reached me about Abu al-Ala that he used to be partisan to Abu al-Tayyib, so much so that he used to call him 'The Poet' and call other poets by their names. Ibn al-Athir increased in blaming Al-Ma'arri and said: 'God combined for him blindness in sight and insight.'\nI say: Al-Ma'arri is excused in preferring Al-Mutanabbi over others, and he is not an innovator in preferring him over other poets, for most people are on this doctrine. Neither Al-Ma'arri nor others who preferred him believe he is infallible, not falling into error. But the man, if he excelled, no one caught up with him. He has no peer in my view except Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God Almighty have mercy on him. For Al-Fadil similarly falls in some times to the lowest depth, then leaps a leap for which the Pleiades are soil, leaving those who follow his trace stopping at his steps having returned backwards. Like his saying: 'And my thoughts are weary (kalilah), and my disposals are few (qalilah), and my protection (hamiyati) is as you know it (hama-ha), and the mixing (khulta) is confusion (takhlit), so if our master hears a son of a lip (word) about me, it is a foundling (laqit).' Similarly Abu al-Tayyib, while you see him according to the custom of poets from medium to bad, suddenly he brings a good thing leaving people shaking off the dust of his precedence from their chests, and he sits on the beds of the horizon reassured while poets wander in their valley. As he said: 'Fa-dhi al-dar akhda' min mumisin / wa amkar min kaffati al-habili' (For this abode is more deceiving than a prostitute / and more cunning than the net of a hunter). Then he followed it with his saying: 'Tafana al-rijalu 'ala hubbiha / wa ma yahsuluna 'ala ta'ili' (Men perished over love of her / and they do not obtain any benefit). And as he said mourning Sayf al-Dawla's mother: 'Atathunna al-musiba ghafilat / wa dam' al-huzn fi dam' al-dalali' (Calamity came to them unaware / and the tear of grief was in the tear of coquetry). Then he said: 'Wa ma al-ta'nith li-ism al-shams 'ayb / wa la al-tadhkir fakhr lil-hilali' (Femininity is no defect for the name of the sun / nor is masculinity a pride for the crescent). And as he said in it: 'Ra'aytuka fi al-ladhina ara mulukan / ka-annaka mustaqimun fi mahal' (I saw you among those I consider kings / as if you are straight in an absurdity). Then he followed it with his saying: 'Fa-in tufuq al-anam wa anta minhum / fa-inna al-misk ba'd dam al-ghazali' (If you surpass people while you are of them / then musk is some of the blood of the gazelle). And as he said in mourning the son of Sayf al-Dawla: 'Bina minka fawqa al-raml ma bika fi al-raml / fa-hadha alladhi yudni ka-dhaka alladhi yubli' (We have from you above the sand what you have in the sand / for this which wastes (us) is like that which decays (you)). Then he followed it: 'Ka-annaka absarta alladhi bi wa khiftahu / idha mitta fa-khtarta al-himam 'ala al-thukli' (As if you saw what is in me and feared it / if you died, so you chose death over bereavement). And as he said: 'Layta al-mada'ih tastawfi manaqibahu / fa-ma kulaybun wa ahlu al-a'sur al-uwali' (Would that praises exhaust his virtues / for what is Kulayb and the people of the first ages?). Then he followed it with his saying: 'Khudh ma tarahu wa da' shay'an sami'ta bihi / fi tal'at al-shams ma yughnika 'an zujali' (Take what you see and leave a thing you heard of / in the rising of the sun is what dispenses you with Saturn). And as he said: 'Nalumuka ya 'Aliyyu li-ghayr dhanbin / li-annaka qad zarayta 'ala al-'ibadi' (We blame you, O Ali, for no sin / because you have looked down on the servants). Then he says after this: 'Ka-anna al-hama fi al-hayja 'uyun / wa qad tubi'at suyufuka min ruqadi' (As if the heads in battle are eyes / and your swords were printed from sleep). 'Wa qad suni'at al-asinna min humumin / fa-ma yakhturna illa fi fu'adi' (And spearheads were made from worries / so they do not flash/occur except in a heart). These two verses, even if their thefts (plagiarism) are counted, there is not in the source what has this brocade nor contains this coating. And as he said:",

Then he follows it with his saying: 'Wa law lam ya'lu illa dhu mahallin / ta'ala al-jaysh wa inhatta al-qatam' (If none rose but one of rank / the army would rise and the dust would fall). And as he said: 'Adhummu ila hadha al-zaman uhaylahu / fa-a'lamuhum fadm wa ahzamuhum waghd' (I blame to this time its little people / for their most knowledgeable is stupid and their most resolute is a scoundrel). Then he follows them with his saying: 'Wa min nakad al-dunya 'ala al-hurr an yara / 'aduwwan lahu ma min sadaqatihi budd' (And of the misery of the world upon the free man is that he sees / an enemy whom he has no escape from befriending). It is said that when he claimed prophethood, he was asked: What is your miracle? He said: My saying 'Wa min nakad al-dunya...'. And as he said: 'Sa-tabki shajwaha farasi wa muhri / safa'ih dam'uha ma' al-jusum' (My mare and my colt will weep their sorrow / broad swords whose tear is the water of bodies). Then he says after this: 'Wa kam min 'a'ib qawlan sahihan / wa afatuhu min al-fahm al-saqim' (How many a fault-finder of a correct statement / while his defect is from the sick understanding). And as he said: 'Sahiba al-nas qablana dha al-zamana / wa 'anahum min sha'nihi ma 'anana' (People accompanied this time before us / and what concerned us of its affair concerned them). Then he says: 'Wa idha lam yakun min al-mawt budd / fa-min al-'ajz an takuna jabana' (And if there is no escape from death / it is of inability that you be a coward). And as he said: 'Nitaj ra'yika fi waqtin 'ala 'ajalin / ka-lafz harfin wa'ahu sami'un fahim' (The result of your opinion in a time on haste / is like the utterance of a letter understood by a comprehending listener). Then he says: 'Sadamthum bi-khamisin anta ghurratuhu / wa samhariyyatuhu fi wajhihi ghumum / fa-kana athbata ma fihi jusumuhum / yasqutna hawlaka wa al-arwah tanhazim' (You shocked them with an army of which you are the blaze / and its spears in its face are clouds / So the most steady thing in it was their bodies / falling around you while the spirits were defeated). And as he said: 'Wa innama yablugh al-insan taqatuhu / ma kull mashiyat bi-al-rijl shamlal' (A human only reaches his capacity / not every gait with the leg is brisk). Then he says: 'Dhikr al-fata 'umruhu al-thani wa hajatuhu / ma qatahu, wa fudul al-'aysh ashghal' (The mention of a youth is his second life, and his need / is what nourishes him, and excess of living is busy-work). This verse contains three proverbs. And as he said: 'Ajibtu li-man lahu qadd wa hadd / wa yanbu nabwat al-qasm al-kaham' (I wondered at one having a stature and an edge / yet dulls the dullness of the blunt breakage). Then he says: 'Wa lam ara fi 'uyub al-nas shay'an / ka-naqs al-qadirin 'ala al-tamam' (I have not seen in the faults of people anything / like the deficiency of those capable of perfection). And as he said: 'Dharini anal ma la yunal min al-'ula / fa-sa'b al-'ula fi al-sa'b wa al-sahl fi al-sahl' (Let me attain what is not attained of highness / for the difficult of highness is in the difficult and the easy in the easy). Then he says: 'Turidina luqyan al-ma'ali rakhisatan / wa la budda duna al-shahd min ibar al-nahl' (You want the meeting of high matters cheaply / but there is no escape, before the honey, from the needles of the bees). And as he said: 'Aba Shuja'in bi-Farisin 'Adud al-Dawla / Fannakhusru Shahanshaha / asamiyan lam tazidhu ma'rifatan / wa innama ladhdhatan dhakarnaha' (Abu Shuja' in Persia, Adud al-Dawla / Fannakhusru Shahanshah / names that did not increase him in definition / but for pleasure we mentioned them). This is a little of much, and few of abundant. But this amount is sufficient in indicating what he has of good. So look at his decline and his elevation. But where is his elevation! These two men, their mention has traveled, their command is established, and their wine has intoxicated minds. 'And in fatigue is one who envies the sun its light / and claims to bring a like for it.' For Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God have mercy on him, was unique in correspondence, and Al-Mutanabbi was unique in poetry despite what they had of decline, but the decline of Al-Mutanabbi is lower and uglier. If people, when they saw a generous one being stingy at a time, or a brave one fleeing at a time, or a skilled craftsman falling short at a time, threw them with blame and attacked them and did not count charity for them, there would not be in existence a generous one, nor a brave one, nor a skilled craftsman, nor an eloquent orator, nor an excellent poet. The consideration is by the majority and most, and the little is pardoned, for infallibility is not stipulated except for the Messengers, God's blessings and peace be upon them.\n\nAl-Ma'arri has two verses preferring Abu al-Tayyib over Abu Tammam, which are: 'Ma Habibun illa adibun wa lakin / ma arahu yuqaribu al-Mutanabbi / dha al-ma'ani al-ghara'ib al-la'i asharna / jufuni dahran wa tayyamna qalbi' (Habib [Abu Tammam] is but a littérateur, but / I do not see him approaching Al-Mutanabbi / Possessor of strange meanings which made sleepless / my eyelids for a time and enslaved my heart). When Abu al-Ala finished classifying the book 'Al-Lami' al-Azizi' in explaining the Diwan of Abu al-Tayyib and it was read to him, the group began describing it. He said: 'As if Al-Mutanabbi looked at me with the glance of the unseen when saying: Ana alladhi nazara al-a'ma ila adabi / wa asma'at kalimati man bihi samam (I am the one whose literature the blind looked at / and my words made the deaf hear).' It is said: If Al-Ma'arri was alone from those he did not trust, he would say: 'Hand me the miracle of Ahmad,' meaning the Diwan of Abu al-Tayyib. If he was in other than privacy he would say: 'The Poet.' This is similar to what is told of Plato, that if he sat for people and speech was requested of him, he would say: 'Wait until the People arrive,' or perhaps he said: 'Wait until the Intellect arrives,' meaning Aristotle. He used to call the Diwan of Abu Tammam 'Dhikra Habib' (Memory of Habib/Beloved) and call the Diwan of Al-Buhturi 'Abath al-Walid' (The Play of Walid/Child). This allows praise and blame. As for praise, because the play of a child (Walid) is sweet to hearts. As for blame, because play in itself is blameworthy to the wise. And he calls the Diwan of Ibn Hani al-Maghribi 'Raha tathanu quruna' (A mill grinding horns). By my life, Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri was not fair to Ibn Hani in this naming. Is he not the one who says in the Ra-rhyme poem:",

    "text": "'Wa janaytum thamara al-waqa'i'i yani'an / bi-al-nasri min waraq al-hadid al-akhdari' (And you gathered the fruit of battles ripe / with victory from the green leaves of iron). And from it: 'La ya'kulu al-sirhan shilwa ta'inihim / mimma 'alayhi min al-qana al-mutakassiri' (The wolf does not eat the corpse of their stabbed one / due to what is upon him of broken spears). Some people err in this verse and say: It is closer to blame than praise, because he described them that due to the large number gathering against one of their enemies, they break spears in stabbing him until they kill him, so broken spears gather on him preventing the wolf from eating him. The matter is not so, because 'the stabbed one' is intended to be from the praised ones themselves. The meaning: If a stabbed one from them dies, he does not die except after a large creation of enemies gather against him. So the stabbed one is from the praised ones, not their enemy, and this is the ultimate praise. Does he not have that Fa-rhyme poem, and what is in it of likening stars until he ended at mentioning Suha, saying: 'Ka-anna suhaha 'ashiqun bayna 'uwwadin / fa-awinatan yabdu wa awinata yakhfa' (As if its Suha is a lover among visitors / so sometimes he appears and sometimes hides). It is famous and all good. Does he not have the Dal-rhyme poem beginning: 'Imsahu 'an naziri kuhla al-suhad / wa unfudu 'an madja'i shawka al-qatad / aw khudhu minni ma abqaytum / la uhibbu al-jisma maslub al-fu'ad' (Wipe from my eye the kohl of sleeplessness / and shake off from my bed the thorns of tragacanth / Or take from me what you left / I do not love the body robbed of the heart). From it in describing armor: 'Kullu raqraq al-hawashi fawqahu / ka-'uyunin min afa'in aw jarad / fa-'ala al-ajsadi waqdun min sana / wa 'ala al-madhiyyi sabghun min jasad' (Every shimmering-sided one upon him / is like eyes of vipers or locusts / So upon the bodies is a fuel of light / and upon the armor is a dye of saffron/body). Does he not have the other Fa-rhyme poem in which he says: 'Wa laqad hazaztu ghusunaha bi-thimariha / wa hasartuhunna muhafhafan fa-muhafhafa / fa-radadtuha min rahatayhi marratan / wa sharibtuha min muqlatayhi qarqafa / ma kana aftakani law ikhtarat-tu yadi / min nazirayka 'ala raqibika murhafa' (I shook its branches with their fruits / and bent them slender one by slender one / I returned it from his palms once / and drank it from his eyes as strong wine / How deadly I would have been if I drew my hand / from your glances a sword against your watcher). Does he not have the Kaf-rhyme poem starting: 'Fatakatu tarfika am suyufu abik / wa ku'usu khamrika am marashifu fik / ajladu murhafatin wa fatku mahajirin / la anti rahimatun wa la ahluk' (The lethal attacks of your glance or the swords of your father / and the cups of your wine or the sipping-places of your mouth? / Skins of swords and lethality of eyes / neither you are merciful nor your family). From it: 'Mana'uki min sinat al-kara wa saraw fa-law / 'atharu bi-tayfin tariqin zannuk / wa da'awki nashwa ma saqawki mudamatan / lamma tamayala 'atfuki ittahamuk' (They prevented you from the slumber of sleep and traveled, so if / they stumbled on a visiting phantom they suspected you / And called you intoxicated; they did not give you wine / when your side swayed, they accused you). He has beautiful things. As for his transitions (takhallusat), they are of the best kind. But Al-Ma'arri was prejudiced against him. As for Abu al-Tayyib, it is of his happiness that nearly forty virtuous scholars explained his Diwan. Among them Al-Wahidi, and suffice you; and among them Imam Fakhr al-Din. Sheikh Taj al-Din al-Kindi, may God have mercy on him, has marginalia on his Diwan better than the margins of temples on the margins of cheeks, containing abundant benefits and important rules of strange language, parsing, and meaning having no peer. I have listed those who explained his Diwan in his biography in the book 'Al-Wafi bi-al-Wafayat'. The Vizier Al-Maghribi said in the book 'Adab al-Khawass', having said 'Al-Mutanabbi', and our Maghrebi brothers say 'Al-Mutanabbih'. I said: This is a good distortion from the Maghrebis, and it is not fitting that he be called Al-Mutanabbi (The Prophesier). Sheikh Taj al-Din used to narrate two verses for Abu al-Tayyib with a chain of transmission connected to him, not in his Diwan: 'A-bi-'ayni muftaqirin ilayka nazartani / fa-ahantani wa qadhaftani min haliq / lastu al-maluma ana al-malumu li-annani / anzaltu amali bi-ghayr al-Khaliq' (Is it with the eye of one in need of you that you looked at me? / So you insulted me and cast me from a high place / I am not the blamed one; I am the blamed one because I / landed my hopes on other than the Creator). On the whole, Abu al-Tayyib was granted happiness in his poetry what others were not granted. Among those who criticized him and attacked him were Al-Sahib bin Abbad in small booklets, and among them Ibn Waki' in 'Al-Munsif'. Ibn Sharaf al-Qayrawani said in 'Abkar al-Afkar': He is more unjust than Sodom. Al-Wahid al-Maghribi attacked him and Ibn Jinni severely. Among them Al-Hatimi in a small treatise, and another treatise Al-Hatimi dictated regarding his defects, a small volume. He has 'Al-Muwazana' (Comparison) between him and Abu Tammam. Al-Jurjani, may God have mercy on him, has the book 'Al-Wasata' (Mediation) between Al-Mutanabbi and his opponents; he was not free in it from siding against him. Among them Al-Nasih ibn al-Dahhan in a treatise he named 'Al-Risala al-Sa'idiyya' in the Kindian objections. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'If a human were like a arrow-shaft (qidh), people would say: If only.' There is no answer for one who criticizes his good poetry except what he said describing his poem: 'Bi-dhi al-ghabawati min inshadiha samam / kama tadurru riyah al-wardi bi-al-ju'ali' (In the stupid one is deafness from reciting it / just as the winds of the rose harm the dung beetle).\n\n**Regarding connecting Hamzat al-Qat' and cutting Hamzat al-Wasl**\nHe said in Verbal Complexity also: From this section is connecting the Cutting Hamza (Hamzat al-Qat'), which is counted among poetic licenses not permissible in prose, and likewise cutting the Connecting Hamza (Hamzat al-Wasl). Then he cited the saying of Abu Tammam:",

    "text": "'Fa-asbaha yalqani al-zamanu min ajilihi / bi-i'zami mawludin wa ra'fati walidi' (So time began meeting me due to him / with the honoring of a newborn and the compassion of a father). \nI say: As for cutting Hamzat al-Wasl, he is excused in counting it a defect, and in my view it is like shortening the extended (madd) in ugliness. Connecting Hamzat al-Qat' I see as extending the shortened, which is better. That is because you transfer the heavier to the lighter in them, unlike those two where you transfer the lighter to the heavier. As for making Abu Tammam's saying 'min ajilihi' (from his sake - transferring vowel) something permissible only in poetry and verbal complexity in words, the matter is not so. This is from the chapter of Transfer (Naql), and the readers of Tajwid know that and do not call it connecting the Hamza, rather transferring the vowel from the moving letter to the silent one. Like His Almighty's saying 'Wa law-annahum sabaru' (If they had been patient). The Waw of 'Law' is silent; if they wanted transfer, they transferred the vowel of the Hamza following it to it. They said: 'Wa lawannahum'. This is famous, apparent, not denied. They recited His Almighty's saying: 'Min ajili dhalika katabna 'ala bani Isra'il' (Because of that We decreed upon the Children of Israel) by transferring the vowel of Hamza to the Nun in 'min'. This is like the saying of Abu Tammam. If this rule is regular in the Quran, all of it from beginning to end, how does he prevent it and make it of poetic necessities and complexity in words? Yes, it is ugly in the like of Al-Mutanabbi's saying: 'Yuwassituhu al-mafuza kulla yawmin / tulabu al-talibina la al-intizaru' (He centers him in the desert every day / the pursuit of seekers not the waiting). And his saying also: 'Wa shiddatu al-zanni la al-istidlalu' (And strength of suspicion/opinion not deduction). For even if it is according to the rule, it is heavy as you see.\n\n**Semantic Industry**\nHe said in the second essay on Semantic Industry, mentioning the wisdom of the Greeks and their sciences, that Abu Nuwas, Muslim bin al-Walid, Abu Tammam, Al-Buhturi, Abu al-Tayyib and others like Abd al-Hamid, Ibn al-Amid, and Al-Sabi did not learn anything from the books of the Greeks and brought what they brought. Then he exemplified with himself that he did not observe that and brought what he brought, and claimed here what he claimed for himself.\n\nI say: My dispute here is only in his judgment that these did not engage with anything of that. I say to him: From where did you know this to judge by it? As for your claim for yourself, I do not oppose you in it, for people know themselves best. As for Abu Nuwas, it is said that he used to engage in Fiqh until it was said of him: Abu Nuwas is a jurist whom poetry overcame, and Al-Shafi'i is a poet whom Fiqh overcame. With that, no Fiqh appeared from him, just as no engagement with Greek sciences appeared from him. Absence of evidence does not indicate absence of the thing evidenced. Furthermore, he was in the time of Al-Rashid, Al-Amin, and Al-Ma'mun, and these sciences became famous in their days, especially in the time of Al-Ma'mun, for he arranged gold for those who translated Greek books into Arabic like Hunayn ibn Ishaq, Ibn Bakhtishu', and others. Do you not see Abu Nuwas said: 'Fa-qul li-man yadda'i fi al-'ilmi falsafatan / hafizta shay'an wa ghabat 'anka ashya'' (Say to one who claims philosophy in knowledge / you memorized a thing and things were absent from you). If you say: This indicates his rejection of these sciences and leaving them, I say: He only said this in the context of verses inciting intoxication, repelling hangover with wine, addiction to that, indulgence in pleasures, and continuing drinking and gatherings of intimacy, until he ended his speech with this verse in response to those advocating wisdom, and that taking much wine is forbidden rationally, and excess of it is harmful medically. So he began to fool the wise man in his opinion and say: You memorized a thing of wisdom, and things were absent from you of the pleasures of addiction to drink and rejoicing, according to the custom of poets in incitement. Then he said in it: 'La tahzur al-'afwa in kunta imra'an harijan / fa-inna hazraka bi-al-dini izra'' (Do not ban pardon if you are a critical man / for your banning in religion is contempt). This is according to the custom of poets in their debauchery, otherwise the correct view is the prohibition of wine. And Abu Nuwas's saying: 'Abaha al-'Iraqiyyu al-nabidha wa shurbahu / wa qala: haramani al-mudamatu wa al-sakru / wa qala al-Hijaziyyu: al-sharaban wahidun / fa-hallat lana min bayni qawlayhima al-khamru / sa-akhudhu min qawlayhima tarafayhima / wa ashrabuha la faraqa al-wazira al-wizru' (The Iraqi permitted Nabidh and its drinking / and said: Wine and drunkenness are forbidden / And the Hijazi said: The two drinks are one / so wine became lawful for us between their two sayings / I will take from their sayings their two sides / and drink it; may the burden not separate from the bearer). Whoever looks closely at these verses knows that Abu Nuwas was a logician, for his deduction of the permissibility of wine from the premises of the speech of the Iraqi jurist and the Hijazi indicates that. This is according to the custom of poetic metaphor, otherwise the correct view is the prohibition of wine.\n\n**Is it true that some poets and writers reviewed the wisdom of Greeks and their sciences?**\nAs for Abu al-Tayyib, he said: 'I and Abu Tammam are wise men (Hakims), and the poet is Al-Buhturi.' The speech of these two poets indicates that they were not bare of something of the sciences of philosophy. Especially Al-Mutanabbi; the 'Hatimiya' indicates he used to look into the speech of the people (philosophers). Do you not see his saying praising Ibn al-Amid:",

    "text": "'Man mubligh al-A'rabi anni ba'daha / jalastu Ristalis wa al-Iskandara / wa sami'tu Batlaymus darisa kutubihi / mutabaddiyan mutamallikan mutahaddira' (Who will convey to the Bedouins that after it / I sat with Aristotle and Alexander / And heard Ptolemy studying his books / while being a Bedouin, a King, and a civilian?). This is far from issuing from one who did not look into the books of the people (philosophers). Al-Ma'arri said, citing Abu al-Tayyib's saying: 'Ilfu hadha al-hawa'i awqa'a fi al-an / fusi anna al-himama murru al-madhaqi / wa al-asa qabla furqat al-ruhi 'ajzun / wa al-asa la yakunu ba'da al-firaqi' (Familiarity with this air has cast into souls / that death is bitter of taste / And sorrow before the separation of the soul is inability / and sorrow does not exist after separation). These two verses are better than a book of Greek books, for their extremity in truth and good observation. If he had nothing but them, that would suffice him in honor. As for Ibn al-Amid, Ibn Khallikan, may God Almighty have mercy on him, said in his biography: 'He was expansive in the sciences of philosophy and astronomy.' I say: The two Ra-rhymed verses mentioned by Abu al-Tayyib in his praise support what Ibn Khallikan said. I say: Is he not the companion of Al-Sahib bin Abbad, and he was of the men of the Mu'tazila, and has a work in their principles? It is impossible that a Mu'tazili does not look into books of philosophy. As for Ibn Abi al-Hadid, he answered him regarding his claim that a human does not need logic nor these sciences in 'Al-Falak Al-Da'ir'. The correct view is that whoever is ignorant of a thing is an enemy to it.\n\n**Witnessing the State and its role in extracting meanings**\nHe said in this: Among what helps in extracting meanings is witnessing the state (shahid al-hal).\nI say: I do not deny that witnessing the state in the external helps in conceptualizing meanings, but deducing meanings does not require witnessing. A group of blind people have come into existence who did not witness forms in the external, yet brought wonderful similes. Like Bashar bin Burd where he said: 'Ka-anna muthara al-nag'i fawqa ru'usina / wa asyafuna laylun tahawa kawakibuhu' (As if the raised dust above our heads / and our swords are a night whose stars are falling). And like Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri where he says: 'Wa laha hilalun mithlu nunin ajadaha / bi-dhawb al-nudari al-katibu ibnu hilali' (And a crescent appeared like a Nun [letter N] done well / with molten gold by the scribe Ibn Hilal). And where he says: 'Laylati hadhihi 'arusun min al-zan / ji 'alayha qala'idun min jumani / wa suhaylun ka-wajnat al-hubbi fi al-law / ni wa qalb al-muhibbi fi al-khafaqani / thumma shaba al-duja wa khafa min al-haj / ri fa-ghatta al-mashiba bi-al-za'farani' (This night of mine is a bride of the Zanj / upon her are necklaces of pearls / And Canopus is like the cheek of love in color / and the heart of the lover in throbbing / Then darkness turned gray and feared abandonment / so it covered the gray hair with saffron). He has many things of strange simile. And like Abu al-Baqa al-Ukbari where he says: 'Wa ghadirin raqqat hawashihi hatta / bana fi qa'rihi alladhi kana sakha / wa ka-anna al-tuyura idh waradathu / min safa ma'ihi tazuqqu firakha' (And a pool whose edges thinned until / appeared in its bottom that which sank / And as if the birds, when they came to it / from the purity of its water, were feeding chicks). How sweet is the saying of Abu Tahir Haydar in the like of this: 'Wa dahiyatin waradat biha ghadiran / yuqaddaru min safa' al-ma'i arda / ka-anna al-wahsha haythu taghibbu fihi / yuqabbilu ba'duha lil-shawqi ba'da' (And a morning I arrived with it at a pool / estimated from the purity of water to be ground / As if the wild beasts, where they drink in it / kiss each other out of longing). And like a group who preceded of the blind like Abu al-Ayna and Ibn Sidah the author of 'Al-Muhkam', and Al-Shatibi, may God have mercy on him, and others of those who brought strange things, and did not use the sense of sight. If you say: These, even if they did not see or witness, heard what others said and likened as others likened. I say: I do not dispute you in that, but I intended that simile does not require the external form. The poet may conceptualize the meaning in his mind without seeing it in the external, and generate the meaning from another meaning. Like the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz: 'Wa ara al-thurayya fi al-sama'i ka-annaha / qadamun tabaddat min thiyabi hidadi' (I see the Pleiades in the sky as if it is / a foot appearing from robes of mourning). For he generated this meaning from the saying of the other: 'Ka-anna ku'usa al-sharbi wa al-laylu muzlimun / wujuhu 'adhara fi malahifa sudi' (As if the cups of the drink while the night is dark / are faces of virgins in black wraps). And as Ibn al-Dharwi said mentioning the Nubians in praise of Saladin: 'Sudun wa tahmarru al-zuba hawlaha / ka-a'yun al-rumdi badat lil-usah / aw la fa-sumrun tantahiha al-qana / mithlu dinanin buzilat lil-suqah' (Blacks, and swords turn red around them / like eyes of ophthalmia appearing to physicians / Or no, brown ones [spears] aiming at them / like jars tapped for cupbearers). For he generated this first meaning from the saying of Al-Arjani: 'Wa ka-anna kulla shaqiqatin muhmarratin / kuhilat mahajiruha bi-ahmara qani / 'aynun li-insanin wa qad ramidat fa-ma / yabdu li-ramiqiha siwa al-insani' (As if every reddened anemone / whose sockets were kohled with deep red / Is an eye of a human that has ophthalmia, so nothing / appears to its beholder except the pupil/human). And he generated the second meaning from the saying of Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri in likening lightning: 'Idha ma ihtaja ahmar mustatiran / hasibta al-layla zanjiyyan jariha' (When it agitated red and flying / you thought the night a wounded Zanj). By my life, he managed this second simile nicely. And as I generated from the saying of Al-Husri: 'Al-nasu ka-al-ardi wa minha hum / min khashin al-lamsi wa min layyin / marwun tashakka al-rajulu minhu al-adha / wa ithmidun yuj'alu fi al-a'yun' (People are like the earth and from it they are / of rough touch and of soft / Flint from which a man complains of harm / and antimony put in eyes). So I transferred it to the famous meaning of Al-Mutanabbi and said:",

    "text": "'Mawlan tafarru'a min kiramin wajhuhum / wa bananuhum lil-mujtali wa al-mujtani / sadu al-anama 'ulan wa hum min jinsihim / wa min al-hijarati ithmidun fi al-a'yuni' (A master branched from nobles whose face / and fingertips are for the beholder and the gatherer / They ruled people in highness while they are of their genus / and from stones is antimony in the eyes). And I also generated from the saying of some Arabs: 'Ka-anna hilalahu mir'atu qaynin / laha shatrun yaluhu min al-ghilafi' (As if its crescent is the mirror of a blacksmith / having a half appearing from the sheath). So I said regarding the cheek-hair ('idhar): 'Qultu idh qila li tasalla fa-hadha / sudghuhu qad daja wa kana yuniru / hiya mir'atu khaddihi ghaba minha / fi ghilaf al-'idhar shay'un yasiru' (I said when told to find solace: This / temple of his has darkened while it was shining / It is the mirror of his cheek, disappeared from it / in the sheath of the cheek-hair a small thing). Or he reverses the meaning to its opposite, which is frequent in simile, because simile falls between two ends, similar and likened-to. If you likened stars to sparks, it is permissible to liken sparks to stars. If you likened lightning to a sword, it is permissible to liken a sword to lightning. If you likened the crescent to a nail clipping, it is permissible to liken a nail clipping to a crescent. Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: 'Wa laha daw'u hilalin kada yafdahun / mithla al-qulamati idh quddat min al-zufuri' (And the light of a crescent appeared, almost exposing us / like the clipping when cut from the nail). Sa'd al-Din ibn Arabi reversed that and said about a beautiful one cutting his nails: 'Ab'adta zufraka wa huwa ba'duka fa-alladhi / yahwaka ajdaru bi-al-bu'ad al-atwali' (You distanced your nail while it is part of you, so the one who / loves you is more worthy of the longer distance). So he answered me: 'A-tazunnuni qallamtuha / 'an hajatin, la bal li-ma'nan 'anna li / li-urika ya man bi-al-hilali yaqisuni / anna al-hilala qulamatun min anmuli' (Do you think I clipped them / out of need? No, but for a meaning that occurred to me / To show you, O who measures me by the crescent / that the crescent is a clipping from my fingertips). How excellent is the saying of Al-Hasan bin Ibrahim al-Natri regarding scissors, fingertips, clippings, and nails: 'Ma 'amilun yahki idha ista'maltahu / wa a'anahu khamsun bi-hinna yaduru / saqran yasidu ahillatan yalma'na min / a'la budurin tahtahunna buhuru' (What worker resembles, if you use it / and five help it with which it turns / A falcon hunting crescents shining from / above full moons beneath which are seas?). And I reversed the saying of some of them regarding roses: 'Ka-anna ihmirara al-wardi wa al-tallu fawqahu / khududun tawala fawqaha al-dam'u bi-al-wakfi' (As if the redness of the rose and the dew upon it / are cheeks upon which tears followed in dripping). So I said from verses: 'Aqsamtu ma saja'at wurq al-hama'imi fi / rawdin 'ala mithli 'atfayha wa la sadahat / wa kullama i'tadalat bi-al-mayli qamatuha / ra'aytuha fawqa husn al-ghusni qad rajahat / wa ma iktasa khadduha min lu'lu'in 'araqan / lakinnaha wardatun bi-al-talli qad rashahat' (I swore the doves did not coo in / a garden on the like of her sides nor sang / And whenever her stature straightened with leaning / I saw her outweigh the beauty of the branch / And her cheek was not clothed with pearls of sweat / but she is a rose that sweated with dew). And I also reversed the simile appearing in His Almighty's saying 'And it runs with them in waves like mountains'. So I said: 'Qad rakkabna 'ala al-baridi li-misrin / bahra ramlin 'ajajuhu 'ajjaju / fa-'akasna al-tashbiha lamma jarayna / fi jibalin ka-annaha amwaju' (We rode on the post to Egypt / a sea of sand whose dust billows / So we reversed the simile when we ran / in mountains as if they were waves). The like of this is called the victory of the branch over the root, just as if you likened the dry date stalk to the crescent, the branch to the figure, the narcissus to eyes, night to hair, and morning to the mouth. It is famous.\n\n**The Merit of Al-Mutanabbi in his Lamiyya in Sayf al-Dawla's Tent**\nHe said after citing Al-Mutanabbi's verses on the tent beginning: 'A-yanfa'u fi al-khaymati al-'adhdhalu' (Does scolding benefit in the tent?), and he quoted fifteen verses from it: These verses have comprised numerous meanings, and it suffices Al-Mutanabbi in merit to bring their like.\nI say: Where is this speech regarding Al-Mutanabbi compared to the speech when citing his saying: 'Fa-la tubrimu al-aqdaru ma huwa halil...' (Destinies do not settle what is dissolving...) the verse, and the disparagement and attack on Al-Ma'arri for preferring him.\n\n**Did Abu Nuwas innovate in his verses 'The wine is circulated upon us in a golden cup'?**\nHe said after citing Abu Nuwas's verses: 'Tudaru 'alayna al-rahu fi 'asjadiyyatin...' (The wine is circulated upon us in a golden cup...) the three verses. Scholars have increased in describing these verses and this meaning, and their saying about it is that it is an innovated meaning. It is told about Al-Jahiz that he said: Poets have ceased not transmitting meanings old and new except this meaning, for Abu Nuwas was unique in innovating it. I do not know what I say to these except to say: You have exceeded the limit of increase, and among current proverbs: 'Without this the donkey is sold.' The eloquence of this poetry in my view is the described, not this meaning. For there is great cost/burden in it. Because Abu Nuwas saw a cup of gold with pictures so he narrated it in his poetry. What I have regarding this is that it is of witnessed meanings, for this wine did not carry except little water, and it submerged the pictures of this cup to the place of their pockets, and the water in it was little to the extent of the caps on their heads. This is a narration of a state witnessed by sight.",

    "text": "I say: Suffice it for this man, may God have mercy on him, to say the like of this. I do not know a book of the mother books of literature like 'Al-Rawda' by Al-Mubarrad, 'Al-Dhakhira' by Ibn Bassam, and 'Zahr al-Adab' by Al-Husri except it contained the mention of these verses and praise for them. Suffice you speech praised by Abu Uthman Amr al-Jahiz, who is among the most skilled Imams of literature, most knowing of what he says, and most insightful of the perceptions of minds. His saying in the like of this is proof, and what he established regarding the verses is the clear path. How excellent is the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil: 'As for Al-Jahiz, may God have mercy on him, there is none of us, assembly of writers, but who entered the neighborhood of his books, launched a raid, and came out with a burden on the shoulder from them.' Al-Fadil, may God have mercy on him, was fond of mentioning him in his correspondence, and mentioning his works. Even if he had nothing in books of literature except the book 'Al-Bayan wa al-Tabyin', that would suffice him in pride. It is said: Among what God favored the nation of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, over other nations is Umar bin Al-Khattab with his politics, Al-Hasan al-Basri with his knowledge, and Al-Jahiz with his expression. It is told of him that he said: 'I entered the Diwan of correspondence in Baghdad, and saw people who polished their clothes, aligned their turbans, and embroidered their cloaks. Then I tested them, and found them as God Almighty said: 'As for the foam, it goes as scum,' clean exteriors and silly interiors. 'So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.'' Among his answers is what is told that he met Al-Jammaz in a gathering in Basra. Al-Jammaz said to him: 'How many fires are in the language?' He said: 'Fire of war, fire of trees, fire of the glow-worm, fire of the stomach, and the known fire.' He said to him: 'You left the most eloquent of fires.' He said: 'And what is it?' He said: 'The fire of your mother's pussy which, whenever a group is thrown into it, its keepers ask it.' Al-Jahiz said: 'As for my mother's fire, I have judged that it has keepers. The matter is regarding your mother's pussy which is told: Are you full? And it says: Is there any more?' Al-Jahiz is too famous to be mentioned with virtues. I recount what Al-Jahiz said. For Ibn al-Athir, may God have mercy on him, promoted the talk. What the Imams of literature reported from him is that he said: 'We found meanings are turned over, and some taken from others, except the saying of Antara regarding the fly: 'Wa khala al-dhubabu biha fa-laysa bi-barihin / ghariidan ka-fi'l al-sharibi al-mutarannimi / hazijan yahukku dhira'ahu bi-dhira'ihi / qadh al-mukibbi 'ala al-zinadi al-ajdhami' (And the fly was alone with it so it is not leaving / singing like the action of the humming drinker / Buzzing, rubbing his arm with his arm / the striking of the one bending over the flint, the amputee). And the saying of Abu Nuwas regarding the pictures of the cup: 'Tudaru 'alayna al-rahu fi 'asjadiyyatin...' (Wine is circulated upon us in a golden cup...) and he recited the verses.' End.\n\nIbn Bassam said in 'Al-Dhakhira', mentioning that Abu Nuwas generated this meaning from the saying of Imru' al-Qais: 'Fa-lamma istatabu sabba fi al-sahni nisfahu / wa shujjat bi-ma'in ghayri tarqin wa la kadiri' (When they found it good, he poured half of it in the bowl / and it was mixed with water neither muddy nor turbid). So he made the drink and the water halves due to the strength of the drink. Abu Nuwas climbed over it and hid it with what he occupied speech with of mentioning the engraved pictures, except that it is a beautiful theft. Abu Nuwas repeated this meaning out of admiration for it in places. Like his saying: 'Banayna 'ala Kisra sama'a mudamatin / mukallalatan hafatuha bi-nujumi / fa-law rudda fi Kisra bin Sasan ruhuhu / idhan lastafana duna kulli nadimi' (We built over Kisra a sky of wine / crowned at its edges with stars / If his spirit were returned to Kisra bin Sasan / then he would have chosen us over every drinking companion). Al-Nashi' took it and generated an extra meaning on it, saying: 'Fi ka'siha suwarun tazunnu li-husniha / 'araban barazna min al-hijali wa ghida / wa idha al-mizaju atharaha fa-tanamnamat / dhahaban wa durran taw'aman wa farida / fa-ka-annahunna labisna dhaka majasidan / wa ja'alna dha li-nuhurihinna 'uquda' (In its cup are pictures you think for their beauty / are Arab women appearing from canopies and young ladies / And if the mixture stirs it, it embellishes / gold and pearls, twin and single / As if they wore that as bodysuits / and made this as necklaces for their necks). Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: 'Wa ka'sin min zujajin fihi usdun / fara'isuhunna albabu al-rijali' (And a cup of glass in which are lions / their prey are the minds of men). Ibn Battal al-Batalyawsi alluded to this, saying: 'Wa ghabin min al-akwasi fiha dharaghimun / min al-rahi, albabu al-rijali farisuha / qara'at biha sinna al-humumi fa-aqla'at / wa qad kada yastu bi-al-fu'adi rasisuhu' (And a forest of cups in which are lions / of wine, the minds of men are their prey / I knocked the tooth of worries with it so they desisted / while their fever almost attacked the heart). Abu Tammam ibn Rabah said: 'Wa kasin bada Kisra biha fi qararatin / ghariqan, wa lakin fi khalijin min al-khamri / wa ma sawwarathu Farisun 'abathan bihi / wa lakinnahum ja'u bi-akhfa min al-sihri / asharu bi-ma danu lahu fi hayatihi / fa-numi ilayhi bi-al-sujudi wa la nadri' (And a cup in which Kisra appeared in a bottom / drowning, but in a gulf of wine / Persia did not depict him in vain / but they brought something more hidden than magic / They indicated what they submitted to him in his life / so we indicated to him with prostration while we do not know).\n\nThis is what Ibn Bassam cited regarding the meaning of the engraved cup. There is no harm in citing what came regarding that for late poets. Of that is the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk: 'Ma al-durru illa dha al-haba / b wa innani bi-al-durri adra / shi'ri wa shi'ra fi al-sama / ' wa fi ku'usika alfu shi'ra / mannat 'alayka wa la kama / mannat 'ala ashla'i Kisra' (Pearls are nothing but this bubble / and I am most knowing of pearls / My poetry and Sirius (Shi'ra) are in the sky / and in your cups are a thousand Sirius / It favored you, and not as / it favored the remains of Kisra).",

    "text": "'Al-khalqu lamma 'asha qad / sajudu lahu taw'an wa qasra / wa al-kullu lamma mata qad / sajudu lahu fi al-ka'si sukra' (Creation, when he lived / prostrated to him obediently and forcefully / And all, when he died / prostrated to him in the cup out of drunkenness). It is not hidden to the intelligent that this is taken from the saying of Abu Tammam ibn Rabah which preceded, and it is better than this. And his saying also: 'Ala inna shurraba al-mudami humu al-nas / wa ghayruhum fihim jununun wa waswas / fa-ya layta anni mithla Kisra musawwarun / fa-laysa yazalu al-dahra fi kaffihi kas' (Verily the drinkers of wine are the people / and others have madness and whisperings / O would that I were like Kisra depicted / so a cup ceases not to be in his hand forever). This is taken from the saying of Abu Firas. It will come later. And his saying also, which is the ultimate in beauty: 'Sharibna 'ala hadha wa dhaka mudamatan / badat ka-al-'aqiqi al-ratbi wa al-dhahabi al-rakhs / u'ida lana fi ka'siha shakhsu Qaysarin / wa Kisra, fa-kadat tab'athu al-ruha fi al-shakhs / Qayasiratun fi qasri Kisra wa rubbama / majanna fa-qulna bal masakina fi khass' (We drank to this and that a wine / appearing like wet agate and soft gold / The figure of Caesar was returned to us in its cup / and Kisra, so it almost resurrected the spirit in the figure / Caesars in the palace of Kisra, and perhaps / we joked and said: Nay, poor people in a hut). And the saying of Ibn Qalaqis al-Iskandari: 'Law lam yusibha al-ma'u hina tawaqqadat / bi-yadi al-mudiri la-khiftu an yatas'ara / wa banaytuha qasran saqaytu bi-rahati / Kisra Anushirwan fihi wa Qaysara' (If water did not hit it when it ignited / in the hand of the manager, I would have feared it would blaze / And I built it as a palace in which I gave drink with my palm / to Kisra Anushirwan and Caesar). And his saying also: 'Anhakat jismaha al-sinina fa-lawla / 'urfuha lam yakun biha dha i'tirafi / fa-ahni fi al-ka'si jisma Kisra bi-rahin / tab'athu al-ruha minhu fi al-a'tafi' (Years wore out its body, so were it not for / its smell, there would be no recognition of it / It bent in the cup the body of Kisra with a wine / resurrecting the spirit from him in the sides). The saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk which preceded is more perfect in beauty. And his saying also: 'Bi-zujajatin darat wa fi janabatiha / Kisra Anushirwan fi iywanihi / khala'at 'ala 'atfayhi khil'ata qahwatin / wa salabtuha fa-ghadawtu fi sultanihi' (With a glass that circulated, and on its sides / Kisra Anushirwan in his Iwan / It bestowed on his sides a robe of coffee / and I robbed it so I became in his authority). Meaning he wore it by drinking it, so he became in his authority, due to the might the drunkard finds. As Al-Munakhkhal the poet of Al-Hamasa said: 'Wa idha sakirtu fa-innani / rabbu al-Khawarnaqi wa al-Sadir / wa idha sahawtu fa-innani / rabbu al-shuwayhati wa al-ba'ir' (And if I get drunk then I am / lord of Al-Khawarnaq and Al-Sadir / And if I sober up then I am / lord of the little sheep and the camel). And the saying of Ibn al-Dharwi: 'Wa musawwarin naza'tu fi / hi 'ala al-mudamati Qaysara / wa salabtuhu mutawwajan / hatta raja'tu musawwara / wa madaytu min 'iqyanihi / wa lujaynihi aghna al-wara' (And a depicted one regarding whom I disputed / over the wine against Caesar / And I robbed him crowned / until I returned bracelet-wearing / And I proceeded from his gold / and his silver the richest of creation). And the saying of Ibn Qalaqis also: 'Wa zujajatin hayyaka minha Qaysaru / wa ka-annama huwa fi jawanibi qasrihi / ma albasathu al-rahu thawban mudhhaban / illa wa qalladahu al-hababu bi-durrihi' (And a glass from which Caesar greeted you / and as if he is in the sides of his palace / Wine did not clothe him in a gilded robe / except the bubbles garlanded him with its pearls). This is taken from the saying of Al-Nashi', and it preceded. How excellent is the saying of Abu Firas: 'A-ghamamu ma yudrika kayfa qitaluna / wa al-khaylu tahta al-nag'i ka-al-ashbahi / natfu wa narsubu fi al-dima'i ka-annana / suwaru al-fawarisi fi ku'usi al-rahi' (O cloud, what lets you know how our fighting is / while horses under the dust are like ghosts / We float and sink in blood as if we are / pictures of knights in cups of wine). Included in what happened to me, containing Tawriya (double entendre): 'Ku'us al-mudami tuhibbu al-safa / fa-kun li-tasawiriha mubtila / wa da'ha sawadhija min naqshiha / fa-ahsanu ma dhahhibat bi-al-tila' (Cups of wine love purity / so be an abolisher/Mubtila of their pictures / And leave them plain of their engraving / for the best they are gilded is with the coating/wine - Tila). And I said also embedding the famous verse, and I demolished from it what I demolished to match the meaning I imagined: 'Wa mashmulatin qad hama Kisra bi-ka'siha / fa-adha yunadi wa huwa fiha musawwaru / waqaftu li-shawqi min wara'i zujajatin / ila al-rahi min farti al-sababati anzuru' (And a chilled wine whose cup Kisra loved / so he became calling out while he is depicted in it / I stood for my longing from behind a glass / looking at the wine from excessive passion). \n\nAs for the saying of Antara regarding the fly, the sheikhs of literature claimed it is of the sterile (unique) similes. Ibn al-Rumi took it and said: 'Wa adhka nasim al-rawdi ray'ana zillihi / wa ghanna mughanni al-tayri fihi fa-rajja'a / wa gharrada rab'iyyu al-dhubabi khilalahu / kama hathhathat al-nudmanu sanjan musharra'a / fa-kanat araninu al-dhubabi hunakum / 'ala shadawati al-tayri darban muwaqqa'a' (The breeze of the garden kindled the prime of its shade / and the singer of birds sang in it and echoed / And the spring fly chirped through it / as drinking companions shook a raised cymbal / So the buzzing of flies there was / upon the songs of birds a rhythmic beat). And Ibn Abdun said: 'Saru wa misku al-dayaji ghayru manhubin / wa turratu al-sharqi ghaflun duna tadhhibi / 'ala ruban lam yazal shadi al-dhubabi biha / yulqi bi-aniqi malfuzin wa madrubi' (They traveled while the musk of darknesses was not looted / and the edge of the East was plain without gilding / Upon hills where the chanting of the fly ceases not / to cast elegant uttered and beaten [rhythms]). He took it from the saying of Al-Muthaqqib al-Abdi mentioning the she-camel: 'Wa tastami'u al-dhubaba idha taghanna / ka-taghridi al-hamami 'ala al-ghusuni' (She listens to the fly when it sings / like the warbling of doves on branches). And the saying of Al-Uqayshir: 'Wa qad taqumu 'ala ra'si muna''amatun / laha idha taribat min sawtiha ghanaju / fa-tarfa'u al-sawta ahyanan wa takhfiduhu / kama yatinnu dhubabu al-rawdati al-haziju' (And a soft woman may stand at my head / having, if enraptured by her voice, coquetry / She raises the voice sometimes and lowers it / as the buzzing garden fly hums). Ibn Abdun took his saying from the saying of Al-Akhtal describing a wild bull. Which is: 'Faridan yughannihi dhubbanu al-riyadi / kama ghanna al-ghuwatu bi-sanjin 'inda aswari' (Alone, the flies of the gardens sing to him / as the seducers sang with a cymbal at walls). Abu Bakr bin Sa'd al-Batalyawsi said: 'Ka-anna ahazija al-dhubabi asaqifun / laha min azahiri al-riyadi maharibu' (As if the hummings of the fly are bishops / having niches from the flowers of the gardens).",

    "text": "No one dared this meaning before Antara. However, Dhu al-Rumma transferred the meaning of the description to the cricket (Jundub), saying: 'Ka-anna rijlayhi rijla muqtifin 'ajilin / idha tajadhaba min bardayhi tarnimu' (As if his two legs are the legs of a hasty plucker / if a humming pulls from his two garments). Al-Salami said regarding a wasp, and excelled: 'Wa labisu lawnin wahidin wa huwa ta'irun / mulawwanatu abradihi wa huwa waqi'u / agharru muhashsha al-taylasani mudajjaju / wa sudu al-manaya fi hashahu wada'i'u / idha hakka a'la ra'sihi fa-ka-annama / bi-salifatayhi min yadayhi jawami'u / bada farisiyya al-ziyyi ya'qidu khasrahu / wa mi'zaruhu al-tibriyyu asfaru faqi'u / yurajji'u alhana al-gharidi wa ma'badin / wa yasqi ku'usan mil'uha al-sammu naqi'u' (Wearing one color while flying / his robes are colored while landing / White-faced, cloak-bordered, armed / and black deaths are deposits in his gut / If he scratches the top of his head, it is as if / in his whiskers from his hands are unions / He appeared Persian of dress tying his waist / and his gold apron is bright yellow / He echoes the tunes of Al-Gharid and Ma'bad / and serves cups whose fill is soaking poison). His saying: 'If he scratches the top of his head...' the verse, is from the saying of Muslim bin al-Walid: 'Fa-ghattat bi-aydiha thimara nuhuriha / ka-aydi al-asari athqalatha al-jawami'u' (She covered with her hands the fruits of her neck / like the hands of prisoners weighed down by shackles). Al-Salami transferred this meaning to the wasp when he generated it from here, and shared with Antara the description as a hidden sharing. Thus is correct poetic imagination. How sweet is the saying of some poets: 'Fi'lu al-adibi idha khala bi-humumihi / fi'lu al-dhubabi yarinnu 'inda faraghihi / fa-tarahu yafruku rahatayhi nadamatan / minhu wa yutbi'uha bi-latmi dimaghihi' (The action of the writer if alone with his worries / is the action of the fly buzzing at his leisure / You see him rubbing his palms in regret / regarding it, and following it with slapping his brain). I only cited these pieces regarding the depicted cup and the fly and increased in them because this place is of the notches of literature and strange meanings. Perhaps this amount has not gathered for anyone in them. As for his saying 'Without this the donkey is sold', the origin of this proverb is that a man wanted to buy a donkey from another called Abu Yasar. He began describing it and exaggerating until he said: 'You hunt ostriches with it hobbled.' He said to him: 'Compare, O Abu Yasar; without this the donkey sells (yanfaqu).' 'Compare' (Shakih) means approach, i.e., do not exaggerate.\n\nHe said: Likewise occurred his saying: 'Ya shaqiqa al-nafsi min hakamin / numta 'an layli wa lam anam / fasqini al-bikra allati i'tajarat / bi-khimar al-shaybi fi al-rahimi' (O twin of the soul from Hakam / you slept through my night and I did not sleep / So give me the virgin [wine] who veiled herself / with the veil of gray hair in the womb). This is an invented meaning not preceded, and it is subtle; due to its subtlety it almost joins meanings extracted without a depicted witness of state. He cited a story that happened in the presence of Al-Rashid regarding extracting its meaning, which is famous.\n\nI say: Abu Nuwas is among those who have meanings whose exterior is easy and interior is difficult, in the utmost subtlety. Like his saying: 'Ama tara al-shamsa hallat al-hamala / wa taba waznu al-zamani wa i'tadala / wa ghannat al-tayru ba'da 'ujmatiha / wa istawfat al-rahu hawlaha kamala' (Do you not see the sun has entered Aries / and the weight of time has become good and balanced / And birds sang after their silence / and the wine fulfilled its year completely?). The place of difficulty in it is 'and the wine fulfilled its year'. They said: From the time of pressing the wine until the sun enters Aries is not but six months or thereabouts, so his claim that the wine fulfilled the year completely is not correct, for the year (hawl) is twelve months. The answer is from aspects: First, and it is the strongest, that the pronoun in 'hawlaha' (its year/orbit) does not refer to the wine, but refers to the sun. As if he said: And the wine fulfilled the orbit of the sun completely. Second, that intended by 'Hawl' here is the limit and completion, and the meaning: The wine fulfilled its maturity and fitness to be used and sipped. In this period the fitness of wine ends, and everything that reached a limit sought from it has fulfilled its 'hawl'. As if from: It changed (hala) from its form to another form. This is what is understood from his speech. Likewise his saying: 'Zallat humayya al-ka'si tabsutuna / hatta tahattaka baynana al-sitru / fi majlisin dahika al-sururu bihi / 'an najidhayhi, wa hallat al-khamru' (The fever of the cup continued to relax us / until the veil was torn between us / In a gathering where joy laughed / showing its molars, and wine became lawful). They mentioned four faces in this: First, that the goodness of the place and perfection of joy permitted its prohibition according to the custom of poets in their exaggerations. Second, that he had sworn to himself not to consume wine until he met his beloved, so the meeting was an exit from his oath. Like the saying of Imru' al-Qais: 'Hallat li al-khamru wa kuntu imra'an / 'an shurbiha fi shughulin shagheli' (Wine became lawful for me, and I was a man / occupied from drinking it by a distraction). Third, he means by 'hallat' descended/settled, from settling in a place. Fourth: He means they deemed it lawful by entering into drunkenness and the absence of their mind. I stood in the Egyptian lands upon a part containing speech by Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Khatib on the poet's saying: 'Bidun mafariquna taghli marajiluna / na'su bi-amwalina athara aydina' (White are our partings, boiling are our cauldrons / we heal with our wealth the traces of our hands). He mentioned regarding his saying: 'White are our partings' two hundred and three faces in the probability of the meaning of these two words. I found two verses for Abu al-Hasan al-Tusi the Jurist, the meaning of the second of which is asked about: 'Mannaynanni hinan fa-lamma / an malaltu min al-tamanni / 'arradna li bi-al-wasli hatta / qultu qad, a'radna 'anni' (They gave me false hopes for a time, so when / I became bored of wishing / They hinted to me of connection until / I said 'Enough' (qad), they turned away from me).",

    "text": "The difficulty in it is: How do they hint to him of connection, while he claims they turned away from him? The one turning away does not hint at connection. The answer: 'Qad' here means 'Hasbu' (Enough/Suffice), and that is one of its usages. Like the saying of Abu Tammam: 'Qaduka itta'ib arbaita fi al-ghulawa' (Enough of you, hold back, you exceeded in excess). i.e., Sufficient for you. The meaning: They gave me hope for a time until I got bored, then they hinted to me of connection until, when I said 'This is enough for me', they turned away from me. Two verses happened for me in what I said, the second is difficult, which are: 'Qala wa qad absara dam'i daman / hadha wa ma ra'atka bi-al-bayni / fa-qultu: lamma faniyat admu'i / bakaytu bi-al-dam'i bi-la 'ayni' (He said, having seen my tear as blood / This, while she did not frighten you with separation / So I said: When my tears perished / I wept with the tear (dam') without 'ayn' (eye/letter 'ayn)). The difficulty in that is: How does he confess that his tears perished and ran out, then say after that: I wept with the tear without an eye? And how does weeping without an eye happen? The answer: He said first he saw him weeping blood so he denied that to him. So he said when tears ran out and no tear remained for me, I wept with blood. The 'Ayn here is intended to be one of the letters of the alphabet, the sister of the dotted Ghayn, not the eye which is the limb of human sight. For 'Dam'' (Tear), if you delete the 'Ayn from it, it becomes 'Dam' (Blood).\n\n**Can a meaning be invented from a non-invented meaning?**\nHe said: Know that an innovated meaning may be extracted from a meaning that is not innovated. From that is the saying of the poet known as Ibn al-Sarraj regarding the cheetah (Fahd): 'Tanafasa al-laylu fihi wa al-naharu ma'an / fa-qammasahu bi-jilbabin min al-muqali' (Night and day competed in it together / so they clothed it in a robe of eyeballs). This is not of the strange meanings, but it is a good simile falling in its place. A poet from the people of Mosul called Ibn Musanhir came after him and extracted from this verse a strange meaning, saying: 'Wa naqqatathu hiba'an kay yusalimaha / min al-manaya ni'aju al-ramli bi-al-hadaqi' (And the ewes of the sand dotted him as a gift so he would make peace with them / from deaths, with [their] pupils). \n\nI say: The first of Ibn al-Sarraj's verses: 'Shathnu al-barathini fi fihi wa fi yadihi / ma lil-qawadibi wa al-'assalati al-dhubuli / wa al-shamsu mudh laqqabu bi-al-ghazalati lam / tatlu' li-khifatihi illa 'ala wajali' (Rough of claws, in his mouth and in his hand / is what belongs to sharp swords and pliable spears / And the sun, since they nicknamed it 'Gazelle' (Ghazala), did not / rise due to fear of him except in dread). I do not know the meaning of his saying: 'He extracted from it a strange meaning.' What strange thing did the second one bring? The strange meaning is that the whiteness and blackness of the cheetah resemble eyes. This is the spirit of this meaning. As for 'Night and day competed in it', and 'The ewes made peace with him and dotted him', it is not a big deal. As for extracting a strange meaning from another meaning, it is like the saying of Muslim bin al-Walid: 'Tazallama al-malu wa al-a'da'u min yadihi / la zala lil-mali wa al-a'da'i zallama' (Wealth and enemies complained of injustice from his hand / May he cease not to be an oppressor to wealth and enemies). He extracted it from the saying of Abu Nuwas: 'Bahha sawtu al-mali mimma / minka yad'u wa yasihu' (The voice of wealth became hoarse from / calling and shouting because of you). Muslim's saying is more eloquent and his meaning more profound. Extractions of meanings from meanings less than them in strangeness happened to me. Of that is the saying of Baylik al-Qibjaqi al-Ma'arri regarding the Citron (Utrujj): 'Wa utrujjatin ja'at ilayka hadiyyatan / fa-shabbahtu minha al-riha riha habibi / idha nazarat 'ayni ilayha tamaththalat / bi-kaffi maridin maddaha li-tabibi' (And a citron came to you as a gift / so I likened its smell to the smell of a beloved / If my eye looks at it, it represents / the hand of a sick man extending it to a doctor). I extracted another meaning from it and said: 'Aya husna utrujjin yaluhu li-naziri / 'alayhi min al-awraqi khudru al-ghala'ili / haka mustahaman ghayyara al-baynu halahu / wa qad 'adda ayyama al-jafa bi-al-anamili' (O beauty of a citron appearing to my sight / upon it from leaves are green tunics / It resembled a lover whose state separation changed / and has counted the days of estrangement with fingertips). From that is the saying of Shihab al-Din al-Talla'fari: 'Jaraytu bi-hamra'i al-kumayti ila al-shaqra / mafarra al-hawa tiban wa a'radtu 'an Maqra' (I ran with the red bay wine to the blond/sorrel horse / the escape of passion in goodness and turned away from Maqra). I extracted another meaning from it and said: 'Wa hamra'a lamma tarashshaftuha / janaytu al-masarrata fima janaytu / wa nultu al-masarrati duna al-wara / li-anni sabaqtuhum bi-al-kumayt' (And a red one, when I sipped it / I gathered joy in what I gathered / And attained joys to the exclusion of people / because I beat them with the Kumayt (dark red wine/bay horse)). And from that is the saying of Mahyar al-Daylami: 'Hal al-sabiqu al-'ajlanu yamliku amrahu / fa-ma kullu sayri al-ya'mulati wakhidu / ruwaydan bi-akhfafi al-mataya fa-innama / tudasu jibahun fi al-thara wa khududu' (Does the hasty preceder own his affair? / For not all the march of camels is a trot / Gently with the hoofs of the mounts, for only / foreheads in the soil and cheeks are being trodden). I extracted another meaning from it and said: 'Adha nasimu Dimashqa hayyahu al-haya / yamshi al-huwayna fi zilali himaha / wa ka-annahu min ma'iha wa hidabiha / ma dasa illa a'yunan wa jibaha' (The breeze of Damascus—may rain greet it—became / walking slowly in the shadows of its sanctuary / As if, from its water and its hills / it trod nothing but eyes and foreheads). And from that is the saying of Ibn al-Tilimsani: 'Saqin yurini qalbahu qaswatan / wa kullu saqin qalbuhu qasi' (A cupbearer showing me his heart as hardness / and every 'Saqin' (cupbearer/leg), its heart (middle letter) is Qaf (Qasi - hard)). I extracted another meaning from it and said: 'Qalb al-danni min ahabba fa-adhat / nafhatu al-naddi min humayyahu tuhda / qala li i'jab fa-qultu ghayra 'ajibin / kullu dannin qallabtahu kana nadda' (The heart of the cask (Dann) is who he loved, so / the scent of aloes-wood (Nadd) became gifted from its fever / He said to me: Wonder! I said not wondering: / Every Dann (cask), if you reversed it, becomes Nadd (aloes-wood)). Among the best I stood upon regarding the cheetah is the saying of the poet: 'Wa muttasifin bi-al-fatki 'inda iktisabihi / 'ala zufrihi shibhu al-dima'i wa nabihi / ka-anna mahata al-fulki lamma intaha bihi / madahu ila sirbi al-maha wa intihabihi /",

    "text": "'Ramat-hu bi-shuhbi al-jawwi khawfa intiqamihi / fa-atfa'aha fi 'asjadin min ihabihi' (She threw him with the shooting stars of the sky fearing his revenge / so he extinguished them in the gold of his skin).\n\n**Discussing a model of Ibn al-Athir's composition**\nHe said: From that is what I mentioned in a chapter of a book on besieging a town, mentioning fighting with the mangonel (Manjaniq), so I said: 'So we encamped within sight and earshot of it, and surrounded it like the ring around the finger. Mangonels were set up so they created clouds difficult to lead, exclusive to the hills (ruba) to the exclusion of the lowlands (wahad). They ceased not to bombard the boulders of the wall with a shower of their boulders, and surprise it with their thunders before their lightnings, and the lightnings of clouds are before their thunders, until they left the rugged of it plain, and the populated a wasteland.' In this are two strange meanings: First, that these clouds are exclusive to the hills not the lowlands; and the other, that their thunders are before their lightnings.\n\nI say: I do not know what the meaning of his saying in likening dust to 'clouds difficult to lead' is. And his claiming that restricting clouds to hills without lowlands is a strange matter. In this is arbitrariness; some clouds water lowlands and not hills, and some the opposite, this is a sensed matter. If it watered the hills and dried the lowlands, it was exclusive to the hills, and vice versa. How excellent is the saying of Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri: 'Wa law anna al-sahaba hama bi-'aqlin / la-ma arwa ma'a al-nakhli al-qatada / wa law a'ta 'ala qadr al-ma'ali / saqa al-hadabati wa ijtanaba al-wahada' (If the cloud poured with reason / it would not have watered the tragacanth with the palm trees / And if it gave according to the measure of highness / it would have watered the hills and avoided the lowlands). Likewise his claim that lightnings in clouds are before thunders is a non-necessary matter, for lightnings may be seen after thunders, although mostly they are before. There is no harm in citing something of the speech of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may God Almighty have mercy on him, here in mentioning the mangonel. From that: 'The servant wrote while the mangonels had silenced their Muslim index finger (subbaba - hinting at Tashahhud), and the lack of surrender (taslim) was for the truce of the submitting (mustaslima) town.' From it: 'The siege continues on Safed, and thick, severe mangonels have been set up against it, gathering the descriptions of the Zabaninyah (Angels of Hell). We do not hear in the night and day except the first and the second, and may God grant success to the third in the worship of the three (Trinity). The town is a knot, and the Sultan's happiness is blowing in the knots. Its side has not listened until now to the mangonel, nor has its nose been rubbed in the dust from the towers.' From that: 'They did not snatch the snatching until a piercing meteor followed them, nor did they cast themselves into the trench until swords cast them from every side, nor did they advance against the sky of mangonels because it had been adorned by the fighters with the adornment of stars.' From that: 'After setting up mangonels throwing stones of alternating calamities. If ropes follow them bidding farewell, it is imagined that they are stars possessing tails (comets). And after the address of grave matters warned them against obstinacy, and holes shook the sides of walls and the fruit of towers fell.' From that: 'I am descending upon a spring (eyes) whose roaring deafens the hearing, above mountains whose cloud-pile blinds the eye, under a sky whose unveiling this morning made me suspicious. Before me is fighting in which its director passes the cup of death, and behind me are stones of mangonels which, if the dots of the letters of the Zodiac saw them, their lines would be erased.' From that: 'And the mangonel knelt judging it, and the tongue of its rope disputing with it. The servant under the Islamic mangonel exposes the face to the Frankish mangonel, and moves the pieces of barricades like the moving of chess pieces, where shields are pawns and Jafatis (siege engines) are rooks, and where citadels are prey and stones are love/grain and mangonels are traps.' From that: 'They tightened on Acre with wooden towers that struck the ranks with stone towers, and advanced with mangonels warring against God and His Messenger, so their hands and feet were cut off from opposite sides.' From that: 'In the frontier are mangonels whose salary is not suspended, nor its striker observed. The biggest of them is what killed the fighter by crushing, and the smallest is what made the pawn of the head a rook.' From that: 'We had descended upon this city and wanted to respect its mouth (Thagh - frontier), and save it from its breaching and gap. But when it was the second day of Adha, and patience had reached from us the limit of one who has no blame in drawing near by sacrificing it, and it was decreed that its hill be thrown down to the forehead, and that it not be taken by trust (Amman) but taken by the right hand (Yamin/Oath), so the mangonels laid it down and the holes slaughtered it, and blood flowed from it immediately necessitating the South wind from its towers.' From the composition of our Sheikh Judge Shihab al-Din Mahmud, may God have mercy on him, from a poem he composed on the conquest of Al-Marqab: 'Wa amtaratha al-majaniqu allati nasha'at / wa lam yakun qablaha yahmi bihi al-mataru / wa kana lil-kasri minha kullama sana'u / min jinsiha wa li-aydi al-hadmi ma 'amaru / ka-annaha wa majaniqa al-ifrinji laha / fara'isu al-usdi idh azfaruha al-zufuru / wa kam shaka al-hisnu ma yalqa fa-ma iktarathat / ya qalbaha a-hadidun anta am hajaru' (And mangonels rained upon it which rose / and rain did not pour with it before / And there was for breaking from it whatever they made / of its kind, and for the hands of demolition whatever they built / As if they and the Frankish mangonels to them / are prey of lions when their claws are fingernails / How often the fortress complained of what it met but she did not care / O her heart, are you iron or stone?). And from a letter written by Judge Taj al-Din Ahmad ibn al-Athir regarding this conquest also:",

    "text": "'And mangonels launch towards them the arrows of their bows, and it is imagined they are striving towards them with their ropes and sticks. They are among the fiercest opponents to fortresses. If they aim at (ammat) a fortress, it is judged that it is not a protected Imam (Imam Ma'sum). Whenever creation doubted in the instruments of conquest, it was not among the doubters. If it descends in the courtyard of a people, evil is the morning of those warned. It is called to war so it speaks (tukallim - or wounds), and no prayer of war was established at a fortress except that fortress was among those who prostrate and submit (yusallim).' Ibn al-Sa'ati said: 'Wa mata yuhawilu baldatan lam yathnihi / hashdu al-juyushi biha wa la bu'du al-mada / hatamat majaniquhu thanaya suriha / fa-ra'ayta dhaka al-thaghra thaghran adrada' (When he attempts a town, he is not turned back / by the gathering of armies in it nor the distance of range / His mangonels smashed the central incisors of its wall / so you saw that gap (Thaghr - mouth) a toothless mouth).\n\n**Models of Ibn al-Athir's composition in which he claims precedence**\nHe said: From that is what I described regarding the enemy's descent to besiege a town of the lands of the one written about, and that was in the time of winter. Much snow fell on the enemy so he became besieged by it. I said: 'The fighting of lightnings hastened him before the banners, and snow surrounded him so it became trenches intervening between him and the trenches. Winter met his army with its army of cold. The sky faced him with its dusty face not its green one. The earth is like a loaf of pure white bread (qursat al-naqi), and perhaps it is the land of his gathering (Mahshar).' Then he started mentioning the invention of the meaning from the Prophetic Hadith: 'You will be gathered on a white land like a loaf of pure white bread (qursat al-naqi),' meaning the white bread. He hummed and buzzed about that.\n\nI say: Wonder is at him recording these things, collecting and citing them, and preaching after each one a sermon for himself, claiming in it that rhetoric in others is metaphor and in his speech reality, and that he brought necklaces of pearls while others brought a beads and he is not satisfied to say agate. I have cited a letter by Al-Qadi Al-Fadil previously which he issued from Ba'rin, mentioning rains, snows, and tents, and he brought in it beauties that Ibn al-Athir has no hands in, nor do two Farqad stars revolve on its pole for a writer. From the speech of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil: 'As for the snows, that expression (bayan) which connected them kindled them, nay gifted them to the chests which are the houses of the fire of longing, so it cooled/cheered them (athlajaha). The lands were represented as if the Master spread his honor ('ard) over them, and it pleased me that his silver pleased that space ('ard). He showed me the stars in this year having advised in its fertility, so they descended themselves, and appeared visible in the day with their running and retreating ones. It is worthy to be a year washing the dirt of disbelief with the soap of its snow, and giving glad tidings to the Nasiri determination from this foam of what is under it of its pure victory.' From that: 'If God uncovers the mask of doubt, it will be the most worthy station of leaving. You will see nothing but the gathering of insects (hasharat), nay the removing of regrets (hasrat). Its day is piebald with worry and snow, and the spender in it turns his palms over what he spent.' From a letter written by Judge Muhyiddin ibn Qarnus to Judge Taj al-Din ibn al-Athir: 'When he wrote it attacking, the face of the horizon was frowning with clouds, and the mouth of Hama was smiling with snow. Stillness appeared on it, where the centuries (or horns/peaks) turned gray. The servant was overlooking a place surrounded by fruit, and the tree turns its palms over what it spent of its life. It became ascetic so it stripped of the silk of its leaves and wore the cotton of its flowers. You see nothing but trees standing on their roots, and vineyards with empty trellises, and falling snow like scattered moths, and mountains of clouds like fluffed wool.' From the answer of Judge Muhyiddin ibn Abd al-Zahir to this letter: 'Our heading out was then when the mountains were clothed in snows, and storms surrounded us from every side, a surrounding having no openings. In a season in which the sky opened its doors with what its aggregate has no segments (fusul) from those places, nor for the dye of frost tanning the skin of the soil any endurance from fading (nusul). So we returned to the side of Homs, even if the year did not please us. We said all that is forgiven beside what the interest of Islam indicated, covering the specific and general of them. We faced those windy regions, and the distant dwellings on the remote stages, with the thinness of skins fighting against the ice/frost (jalid), and faces facing from those backs what arrival at the pools of death is closer to than the jugular vein. How often the sun wrapped itself seeking protection from its cold (qarr) in a squirrel fur of clouds. How often its eye closed from one whose eyelids did not taste sleep nor covet slumber. How often the freezing cold (zamharir) cast the silver of its snows so it was sound upon casting (sabk). How often news from Imru' al-Qais recited at Al-Nabk 'Qifa nabki' (Stop let us weep). This while the severe cold (Zamita) had extended its washed sheet over the lands and servants, and souls became killed by it not sick. As if it is the streaking of gray hair on the partings, or white sand sprinkled on the lines of those parchments.' Judge Muhyiddin ibn Abd al-Zahir, may God Almighty have mercy on him, has several pieces on the velvet rug (Qatifa) describing its cold. Including his saying: 'Hadhi al-qatifatu allati / la tushtaha 'aqlan wa naqla' (This velvet rug which / is not desired by reason or tradition).",

    "text": "'Hushiyat bi-bardin yabisin / fa-li-ajli dhaka al-hashwi tuqla' (It was stuffed with dry cold / so for the sake of that stuffing it is hated). And his saying also: 'Ala dhammi al-qatifati ijtama'na / wa in hushiyat bi-bardin qad takarrar / wa qad adha 'alayha lil-zamita / bayadun mithlama qad dharra sukkar / wa lam yakun al-mukaffanu ghayra shakhsin / yakunu ila nawahiha musayyar' (We agreed on blaming the velvet rug / even if it was stuffed with cold that repeated / And there became upon it from the severe cold / a whiteness like sugar sprinkled / And the shrouded one was no other than a person / who is made to travel to its regions). The verses of Shihab al-Din al-Shaghuri are famous regarding snow. They are: 'Qad akhmada al-jamra fi kanun hina qadah / wa ajmada al-khamra fi kanun kulla qadah / ya jubbat al-zabadani anti musfiratun / 'an husni wajhin idha wajhu al-zamani kalah / fa-al-thalju qutnun 'alayki al-suhbu tandifuhu / wa al-jawwu yahlijuhu wa al-qawsu qawsu qazah' (He extinguished the ember in Kanun (Dec/Jan) when he struck fire / and froze the wine in Kanun in every cup / O Jubbah (gown/village) of Zabadani, you are unveiling / a beautiful face when the face of time scowls / The snow is cotton upon you, the clouds tease it / and the atmosphere gins it, and the bow is the bow of Qazah (Rainbow)). From this is the saying of Abu al-Fadl the Writer: 'Wa atrabana ghaymun yumazihu shamsahu / fa-tustaru tawran bi-al-sahabi wa taksifu / tara qazahan fi al-jawwi yaftahu qawsahu / mukibban 'ala qutnin min al-thalji yandifu' (A cloud delighted us joking with its sun / so it is covered sometimes by the cloud and eclipses / You see Qazah in the atmosphere opening his bow / bending over cotton of snow teasing it). It is said that snow fell once in Baghdad, so some poets of that era said: 'Ya sudura al-'iraqi lam nara thaljan / qablaha halla fi nawahi al-'iraqi / innama 'amma zulmukum sa'ira al-na / si fa-shabat dhawa'ibu al-afaqi' (O chests/leaders of Iraq, we did not see snow / before it settled in the regions of Iraq / Rather your injustice covered all the people / so the locks of the horizons turned gray). Included in what happened to me regarding that: 'Tabban laha min baldatin la ara / fiha maqami wadiha al-nahji / li-annaha fi wajhi sukkaniha / wa ahliha tabsuqu bi-al-thalji' (Perish a town in which I do not see / my stay as clear of path / Because in the face of its inhabitants / and its people, it spits with snow).\n\n**Beauty in Ibn Baqi's verses: 'By my father is a gazelle my eye flirted with'**\nHe said, citing in the beauties of meanings the saying of the poet: 'Bi-abi ghazalun ghazalathu muqlati / bayna al-'udhaybi wa bayna shattay bariqi...' (By my father is a gazelle my eye flirted with / between Al-Udhayb and the two banks of Bariq...) the verses. This is of the ultimate beauty and charm. Its meanings were so light on the hearts that they almost danced. The last verse is the one described with innovation, and by it and its likes eyes acknowledged the merit of ears...\n\nI say: These verses are by Ibn Baqi, and Ibn al-Abbar cited them in 'Tuhfat al-Qadim'. Then he said: Some people of our era attributed rudeness to Ibn Baqi in his saying: 'Ab'adtuhu 'an muhjatin tashtaquhu' (I distanced him from a soul/blood that misses him). If he had said: 'I distanced from him ribs (adali'a) that miss him,' it would have been better. Then he cited after that for Abu al-Hakam Ja'far bin Yahya bin Attal al-Dani: 'Hubbuka ladhdha bi-kulli ma'na / ila karan milta aw suhadi / in kana la budda min ruqadin / fa-adlu'i haka 'an wisadi / wa nam 'ala khafqiha huduwwan / ka-al-tifli fi nahnahi al-mihadi' (Your love is sweet in every meaning / whether you incline to sleep or sleeplessness / If there must be sleep / then here are my ribs as a pillow / And sleep on their throbbing quietly / like the child in the rocking of the cradle). When I stood upon what Ibn al-Abbar mentioned of the objection to Ibn Baqi, and the verses of Ibn al-Attal, it occurred to me that this should be verse. So I versified that on the rhyme of Ibn Baqi and his meter: 'Ab'adtuhu min ba'di ma zahzahtuhu / ma anta 'inda dhawi al-gharam bi-'ashiqi / hadha yadullu al-nasa minka 'ala al-jafa / idh laysa hadha fi'la sabbin wamiqi / in shi'ta qul ab'adtu 'anhu adalu'i / li-yakuna fi'la al-mustahami al-sadiqi / aw qul fa-bata 'ala idtirabi jawanih / ka-al-tifli mudtaji'an bi-mahdin khafiqi' (I distanced him after I nudged him / You are not, among those of passion, a lover / This indicates to people harshness from you / since this is not the act of a loving yearner / If you wish, say: I distanced my ribs from him / to be the act of the truthful infatuated one / Or say: So he spent the night on the disturbance of flanks / like a child lying in a throbbing cradle). Look at what he deemed good, praised, and preferred, how people raised objections to it and criticized it. By my life, it is good criticism, a precise approach, and a valid objection. \n\nAs for the throbbing (khafq) of the heart and its disturbance from the lover, the later poets have subtle intents in it. Of that is the saying of Al-Haziri the Paper-merchant: 'Yaqulu li hina wafa / qad nilta ma tartajihi / fa-ma li-qalbika qad ja / 'a khafquhu ya'tarihi / fa-qultu wasluka 'ursun / wa al-qalbu yarqusu fihi' (He says to me when he fulfilled: / You have attained what you hope for / So why has your heart come / with its throbbing afflicting it? / So I said: Your connection is a wedding / and the heart dances in it). And the saying of... 'La tunkiru khafaqana qalbin / ja'a al-habibu ilayhi za'ir / ma tilka illa daruhu / duqqat lahu fiha basha'ir' (Do not deny the throbbing of a heart / to which the beloved came as a visitor / That is but his house / drums of good news were beaten for him in it). And the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk: 'Ama wa-Allahi lawla khawfu sakhtik / la-hana 'alayya ma alqa bi-rahtik / malakta al-khafiqayni fa-tihta 'ujban / wa laysa huma siwa qalbi wa qurtik' (Nay, by God, were it not for fear of your anger / what I meet from your group would be easy for me / You possessed the two throbbing ones (East and West / or Heart and Earring) and wandered in pride / and they are nothing but my heart and your earring). And the saying of Abu al-Walid ibn al-Jannan al-Shatibi: 'Wa abika lam yakhfaq janani innama / taraban bi-ayyami al-'aqiqi yusaffiqu / la yadda'i fihi al-fu'adu khufuqahu / fa-wishahu man ahwa la-'amri akhfaqu' (By your father, my heart did not throb, rather / out of rapture for the days of Al-Aqiq it claps / The heart does not claim its throbbing in it / for the sash of the one I love, by my life, is more throbbing). And the saying of the other: 'Malaka al-qurta wa al-fu'ada fa-haqqun / an yusamma bi-maliki al-khafiqayni / wahidu al-husni fi al-wara thaniyu al-ghus / ni idha masa thalithu al-qamarayni' (He possessed the earring and the heart, so it is right / that he be named the owner of the two throbbing ones / The unique one of beauty in creation, the second of the branch / if he sways, the third of the two moons). And the saying of Al-Badr Yusuf bin Lulu al-Dhahabi: 'Wa ahwa fatiru al-ajfani alma / rashiqun qadduhu rakhsu al-banani'",

    "text": "'Tamallaka qurtuhu wa al-qalbu minni / fa-sara lahu bi-dhaka al-khafiqani' (His earring and the heart from me took possession / so he had by that the two throbbing ones). And the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk from a eulogy: 'Awsa'ta fika al-dahra 'atban mu'liman / fa-ajabani bi-al-buhti wa al-buhtani / qalbi yuhasibuhu 'ala ijramihi / wa ya'udduha bi-anamili al-khafaqani' (I expanded painful blame against Time regarding you / so it answered me with slander and falsehood / My heart holds it accountable for its crimes / and counts them with the fingertips of throbbing). How excellent is the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil also: 'Wa qad khafaqat rayatuhu fa-ka-annaha / anamilun fi 'umri al-'aduwwi tuhasibuhu' (And his banners fluttered/throbbed as if they were / fingertips counting/accountable in the life of the enemy). And the saying of Mu'in al-Din bin Tulwa: 'Lam ansahu idh qala ayna tuhilluni / hadharan 'alayya min al-khayali al-tariqi / fa-ajabtuhu: qalbi fa-qala ta'ajjuban: / a-ra'ayta 'umraka sakinan fi khafiqi' (I did not forget him when he said: Where do you settle me / fearing for me from the visiting phantom? / So I answered him: My heart. He said in wonder: / Have you ever seen a dweller in a throbbing/moving thing?). It is taken from the saying: 'Wa sakanta qalban khafiqan / ya sakinan fi ghayri sakin' (You inhabited a throbbing heart / O dweller in a non-stationary thing). How excellent is the saying of Al-Siraj al-Warraq: 'Ya sakinan qalbi dhakartuka qablahu / a-ra'ayta qabli man bada bi-al-sakini / wa ja'altuhu waqfan 'alayka wa qad ghada / mutaharrikan bi-khilafi qalbi al-amini' (O dweller of my heart, I remembered you before it / Have you seen before me anyone who began with a Sukun (silent letter)? / And I made it an endowment (Waqf) upon you while it became / moving (Mutaharrik) contrary to the heart of the Amin). And the saying of Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn al-Tilimsani: 'Ya sakinan qalbi al-mu'anna / wa laysa fihi siwah thani / li-ayyi ma'nan kasarta qalbi / wa ma iltaqa fihi sakinani' (O dweller of my suffering heart / and there is no second in it other than him / For what meaning did you break (Kasra - vowel) my heart / while two Sukuns did not meet in it?). This meaning, I saw a group of the people of the era fond of it and deeming it good, but it is corrupt. That is because the heart is a vessel for the two dwellers, and the vessel is other than the contained. The rule is that if two Sukuns meet, the second of them is broken (given Kasra). If his heart broke, it is not strange because it is other than the two dwellers (Sakins) and is not one of them. So his denial of it has no meaning. Contemplate that, its corruption will appear. From the meaning of Mu'in al-Din bin Tulwa is the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk, but he walked another path with it where he said: 'Min kulli muhtakimi al-ajfani yukhrijuna / min ardi salwatina fi al-hubbi sahiruhu / ya'wi ila khafiqi al-qalbi al-shajiyyi bihi / fa-a'jab li-man wakruhu fi al-hubbi ta'iruhu' (From every ruler of eyelids, his charmer takes us out / from the land of our solace in love / He shelters in the throbbing of the heart grieved by him / So wonder at one whose nest in love is his flying bird). And his saying: 'Ya ta'ira al-husni alladhi wakruhu / qad halla min qalbi fi ta'iri' (O bird of beauty whose nest / has settled from my heart in a flying thing). And his saying also: 'Wa ta'iru husnin tara qalbi bi-husnihi / fa-ya 'ajaban min ta'irin wakru ta'iri' (And a bird of beauty, my heart flew with his beauty / So oh wonder at a bird whose nest is a bird). From this is the saying of Ibn Qalaqis describing a boat: 'Wa nahnu fi manzelin yasri bi-sakinihi / fasma' haditha muqimin baytuhu ghad' (We are in a house that travels with its dweller / so hear the story of a resident whose house is a goer). Included in what I said regarding the throbbing of the heart: 'Lamma raqadtu ata khayaluka baghtatan / fa-ghada fu'adi khafiqan yatamawwaju / law anna sahbi shahaduni fi al-kara / wa al-qalbu yarqusu fi al-khayali tafaraju' (When I slept, your phantom came suddenly / so my heart became throbbing, surging / If my friends had witnessed me in sleep / while the heart was dancing in the imagination, they would have watched). And from my saying also: 'Hasbi alladhi alqahu fika min al-jafa / wa 'ala al-sahih fa-ba'du dhaka kafani / fanzur ila qalbi idha qabaltuhu / ya ghusnu kayfa yatiru bi-al-khafaqani' (Sufficient for me is what I meet in you of harshness / and correctly, some of that sufficed me / So look at my heart if I face it / O branch, how it flies with throbbing).\n\n**The best said regarding Wine and its Cup**\nHe said: Likewise came the saying of some Maghrebis regarding wine and its cup, which is: 'Thaqulat zujajatun atatna furragha / hatta idha muli'at bi-sarfi al-rahi / khaffat fa-kadat an tatira bi-ma hawat / wa kadha al-jusumu takhiffu bi-al-arwahi' (Glass bottles came to us heavy when empty / until when they were filled with pure wine / They lightened and almost flew with what they contained / and likewise bodies lighten with spirits/souls). This is an innovated meaning. I bear witness that it does to minds the act of wine in intoxication, and thins as it thinned in subtlety, and diffuses as it diffused in fragrance.\n\nI say: They are by Abu Ali Idris al-Yamani. The origin of the meaning is by Ibn al-Mu'tazz where he said: 'Wazanna al-ka'sa farighatan wa mal'a / fa-kana al-waznu baynahuma sawa'' (We weighed the cup empty and full / so the weight between them was equal). But he increased it in exaggeration, which is that cups gained lightness by wine. Then he wanted an example for that in the external world, so he found nothing but the spirit and the body. Similar to this is the saying of Al-Khwarizmi: 'Ra'aytuka in aysarta khayyamta 'indana / lizaman wa in a'sarta zurta limama / fa-ma anta illa al-badru in qalla daw'uhu / aghabba wa in zada al-diya'u aqama' (I saw you, if you became rich you camped with us / clinging, and if you became poor you visited rarely / You are nothing but the full moon; if its light decreases / it visits rarely, and if the light increases it stays). He took the meaning originally from the saying of Ibrahim bin al-Abbas al-Suli regarding Ibn al-Zayyat: 'Yu'rafu al-ab'adu in athra wa la / yu'rafu al-adna idha ma iftaqara' (The distant one is known if he becomes rich / and the near one is not known if he becomes poor). When he wanted to strike an example for that in the external world, he found nothing but the moon and its light. Such is the case of Idris al-Yamani with Ibn al-Mu'tazz. Ibn Hamdis has this exact meaning, for he said: 'Wa ka'si nashwana fiha al-shamsu bazighatun / batat tudimu ila al-isbahi lathma famih / takhiffu mal'a wa tu'ti al-thiqla farighatan / ka-al-jismi 'inda wujudi al-ruhi aw 'adamih' (And the cup of a drunkard in which the sun is rising / spent the night continuing to kiss his mouth until morning / It lightens when full and gives heaviness when empty / like the body upon the presence of the spirit or its absence). And he said also: 'Jisamun tujammi'u sharbuhu ladhthatina / wa 'uquluna bi-al-sukri minhu tabaddadu / wa yakhiffu mal'ana wa yathqulu farighan / ka-al-jismi yu'damu ruhuhu aw yujadu' (Bodies whose drink gathers our pleasures / while our minds are scattered by drunkenness from it / And it lightens when full and becomes heavy when empty / like the body whose spirit is lost or found).",

    "text": "However, Ibn Hamdis conveyed the complete meaning in a single verse, whereas Idris al-Yamani conveyed it in two verses. Yet, Idris's composition clings more to the heart, has a greater impact on the soul, and is sweeter to the ear. Close to this meaning is the saying of Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri in Al-Luzumiyat: 'The cask was nothing but a generic thing... until the choicest wine defined it / Like Adam, who was fashioned from dust... and the breath of the Spirit honored him.' Both of them climbed upon this meaning and transferred it to heaviness and lightness; otherwise, it is the same. Speaking of lightness in wine and flying, how sweet is the saying of Abu al-Husayn al-Fukayk: 'A virgin (wine) wooed, when water mixed with her... she showed us foam in a fit of anger / She almost flew away in aversion when he touched her... were it not for the nets (bubbles) she forged from the bubbles.' Models of Ibn al-Athir's composition in which he claims superiority: He said: 'Something of this type came to me in prose, and I will mention a portion here. Among that is what I mentioned in describing a beautiful image, so I said: It is clothed in the freshest garment of beauty, and created from clay other than the clay of people. Just as it increased in beauty, so too it increased in goodness. Desires agreed upon it until it became beloved to every heart. If it shook hands with the rose, its leaves would become perfumed, and if it passed over the water lily at night, its eyes would open.' I say: What is strange in these meanings? And what creativity is there to establish and wonder at and be pleased by? As for the first, it is taken from the saying: 'A child of kingship, as if God fashioned him... from musk, and decreed the creation of mankind from clay.' It is not hidden that this is more praiseworthy and better. As for the second, it is taken from the saying of Al-Buhturi: 'You were poured into the glass (heart) of every heart... so you are beloved to every soul.' And the saying of Ibn Lankak: 'You were squeezed from the blood of hearts, so you do not... look but that you are attached to hearts.' As for his saying 'If it shook hands with the rose, its leaves would become perfumed,' what merit is there for the one described with this quality when the rose is already fragrant, whether a Zanj (black person) or anyone else shakes its hand? This is redundant (tahsil al-hasil). If he had said: 'If it shook hands with the tamarisk, the scent of the ban-tree would diffuse from it; and if it passed over the water lily at night, it would wake its sleepy eye,' it would have been better. For if Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali or Abu Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan shook hands with the rose, it would still smell good. Praise is only achieved when the person imparts fragrance to what has no fragrance and imparts beauty to what is not known for beauty. Do you not see that they criticized Kuthayyir Azza for his saying: 'No meadow in the rugged ground, soil fragrant... watered by dew on its wormwood and chamomile / Is more fragrant than the sleeves of Azza at midnight... when she has kindled her fire with fresh aloeswood.' It was said to him: 'If this were a Zanj woman and her firewood was fresh aloeswood, her scent would be good and her sleeve perfumed. Why did you not say as Imru' al-Qais said: Do you not see that whenever I come to her at night... I find fragrance in her, even if she has not applied perfume.' For this reason, they approved of the saying of the poet: 'And her scent is more fragrant than her perfume... and perfume contains musk and ambergris.' Look at this poet; when he established that she applies perfume, he made her natural scent better than it. Bashar ibn Burd exaggerated in his saying: 'And if an onion were brought near her... the perfume would overcome the smell of the onion.' However, mentioning the onion made this meaning ugly. It is told that some Shia recited to Abu Mujalid the saying of Al-Sayyid Al-Himyari: 'I swear by God and His signs... and man is responsible for what he says / That Ali ibn Abi Talib... is naturally molded upon guidance and righteousness / That is the one whom, in one night... Michael and Gabriel greeted / Michael among a thousand and Gabriel among... a thousand, and Israfil followed them / On the day of Badr, he scattered them all... as if they were flocks of birds (Ababil).' Abu Mujalid said to him: 'O you, the poet did not praise your companion, but rather satirized him in two places. First, he claimed that Ali, may God honor his face, was naturally molded upon righteousness and guidance, and whoever is molded upon a matter is not praised for it because he did not earn it through his effort. Second, he claimed that he was supported in his wars by angels; thus, he has no virtue in victory, because if Abu Hayya al-Numayri were supported by these, he would have conquered enemies.' Abu Umar al-Zahid mentioned this in the book Al-Yaqutah. Thus, it is proven by the likes of this that there is no praise in his saying: 'If it shook hands with the rose, its leaves would become perfumed.' This is supported by the fact that he realized this in the second rhymed phrase (saj'), so he said: 'And if it passed over the water lily at night, its eyes would open.' He specified 'at night' because in the day its leaves are open. Among the curious things poets have said about the water lily is the saying of Al-Khubz Arzi:",

    "text": "'It feared boredom if its stay was prolonged... so it began to appear at times and hide / As if, when it appears from its rising points... it is a lover kissing a loved one while keeping watch.' I mentioned here the saying of some later poets regarding a rosebud: 'A rose raced to you from the gardens... and came to you before its time, uninvited / It coveted to kiss you when it saw you, so it gathered... its mouth towards you like one seeking a kiss.' This is among the beauties of 'Tadmin' (implication/quoting) which transferred from its origin, because Al-Mutanabbi said about the she-camel in a part of his poem: 'And what changes me is the pulling of the rein to her heart... her mouth towards you like one seeking a kiss.' Although he took it from Ibn Babak, that Tadmin was beautiful. For Ibn Babak said: 'Winter arrived and robbed the blossoms of their joy... the action of gray hair on the hair of a man's lock / A rose opened then returned gathering itself... just as mouths gather for kisses.' How beautiful is the saying of Mujir al-Din Muhammad ibn Tamim regarding the water lily: 'The yellow water lily has come to resemble... the stars, leaving no likeness for them / The eye dives into it when the day... is revealed, and in the darkness, it dives into them (the stars).' He used 'the eye' (al-'ayn) here with two meanings: the first is the seeing eye, and the second is the flowing spring (or literal water). And the saying of Ibn Hamdis al-Siqilli: 'Drink by the pool of a water lily... yellow of petals, green / As if its flowers brought forth... tongues of fire from the water.' How delicate is the saying of Al-Tanukhi in a set of verses: 'It grew accustomed to the waters, resembling them in subtlety... until it could not bear to part from its form / So it stands at times, then raises its head... with effeminacy, swaying, and breaking / As if it is, in the water, a follower of a sect... whom obsession tempted that he is not yet pure.' And the saying of another: 'As if its water lily is a lover... watching the face of the beloved during his day / Until when the night reveals its curtain... and the beloved departs towards the gloomy one / He closes his eyes, hoping to see... in sleep the one he won recently.' The other exaggerated in wit when he said: 'As if, when it disappeared at the time of its evening... into the water and the freshness of its stature was veiled / It was a lover whose beloved threatened to abandon him... unjustly, so he drowned himself out of passion.' Al-Wajih ibn al-Dharwi said, satirizing the Egyptian water lily: 'And a water lily that showed us an interior... with the green exterior, like an ember of dragon's blood / So I likened it, when I intended its satire... to the cups of a cupper containing traces of blood.' A model of Ibn al-Athir's composition in condemning gray hair, in which he claims creativity. He said: 'Among that is what I mentioned in condemning gray hair, so I said: Gray hair is poverty, not wealth (Yesar), and darkness, not lights (Anwar). It is the first death that burns with a fire of worry more intense in fuel than fire. And if a people say it is majesty, they have crushed with it and not clarified (Jallu - pun on majesty), and they gave a verdict describing it without knowledge, so they went astray and led astray. I see it only as a plough (Mihrath) for life, and the tool of ploughing never entered the house of a people but that they were humiliated. Among the wonders of its affair is that it is the boring one whose distance is feared, and the creation whose removal is hated, and when youth was lost, it was a replacement for it, but there is no replacement for it when it is lost.' I say: After finishing this section, he began to hum as usual, claiming that the meaning he invented is comparing gray hair to a ploughing tool. People have compared gray hair to things, among them the ignition of fire, and the Great Quran spoke of it in the Almighty's saying: 'And the head has flared with gray hair.' Al-Arjani said: 'Gray hair has ignited my worn head quickly... and wax melts at the ignition of the head / So if she was frightened by whiteness in its color... long has she been pleased by blackness in its color.' Among them is comparing it to dawn. He said: 'They said wake up from the slumber of amusement and youth... for a wondrous dawn has appeared in your darkness / So I said: My friends, leave me and my pleasure... for sleep is sweet at dawn.' Among them is comparing it to stars, he said... Among them is comparing it to smiling. Abu Tammam said: 'She saw his smiling (gray hair) and her agitation was stirred... and her passion said to the tear: Pour out / So do not let the flashing of gray hair keep you awake... for that is the smile of opinion and manners.' Among them is comparing it to bubbles. He said... Among them is comparing it to dust. Ibn al-Mu'taz said: 'Sharir turned away and resolved to abandon me... and set her conscience to treachery / She said: You have aged and grayed. I said to her... This is the dust of the battles of time.'",

    "text": "Among them is comparing it to a sword. He said: 'If I abstain from error and youth... for long have sins enticed me / A sword for gray hair is drawn... and I said blossoms appeared on its branch.' Among them is comparing it to flowers. Al-Ghazzi said: 'Gray hair shone, so I apologized to it... and said blossoms appeared on its branch / As if the beloved's mouth was assembled in... my parting hair, what shone from her smiling teeth.' Among them is comparing it to the owl and the sandgrouse, like the saying of Al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, in his verses among which are: 'O owl that has nested upon my head... despite me, when its crow flew away.' Al-Ghazzi said: 'A sandgrouse in guidance was my gray hair... even if its excavation named it a crow.' Al-Siraj al-Warraq compared it to safflower (Qurtum), and this was good because he, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, was blonde. So he said: 'The saffron (gold color) is gone from me... and the safflower of my gray hair has appeared / And the one who has owned my neck... rejected me because of my fault.' A Bedouin was asked about gray hair: 'What is this whiteness in your head?' He said: 'A foam churned by days and silver cast by experiences.' How beautiful is the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may Allah have mercy on him: 'Away from me, after the passing of amusement and play... for I do not see in myself what my desire demands / Life is like a cup and days mix it... and gray hair in it is a speck in the place of bubbles.' It was compared to appropriate things other than these, but I have not seen anyone compare it to a ploughing tool. What is the relevance between a ploughing tool and gray hair? What is the face of similarity? This is not from the category of comparing the tangible to the tangible, nor the tangible to the intellectual. I do not know what it is. As for comparing old age to the ploughing itself, it is permissible. As for his saying 'poverty (I'dam) not wealth (Yesar),' it is taken from the saying of Al-Mutanabbi: 'Youth showed me the spirit in my body... and gray hair showed me the spirit in my substitute.' As for his saying 'darkness, not lights,' it is taken from the saying of Abu Tammam: 'It has a sight in the eye, white and pure... but in the heart, it is black and dark.' And the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'You have distanced a whiteness that has no whiteness... you are blacker in my eye than darkness.' How beautiful is the saying of Al-Ghazzi: 'How can the gazelles (women) not flee from gray hair... and it is the habit of gazelles to flee / It is a dark white, and every whiteness... other than in the eye and the parting, is light.' As for his saying: 'It is the first death' - the Saj' (rhyme), Mahmud al-Warraq said: 'Gray hair is one of the two deaths.' Others said: 'Gray hair is a cloud raining sorrows.' As for his saying: 'And if a people say it is majesty' - the Saj', I was reminded by it of the saying of some later poets: 'They said a man's youth is amusement and delusion... and behind it is the gray hair of dignity, and there is no doubt / And what dignity is there for a man stripped of youth... with gray hair before him and gray hair behind him.' As for his saying: 'It is the boring one whose distance is feared,' it is taken from the saying of Muslim ibn al-Walid, and the saying of Muslim is utmost beauty: 'Gray hair is hateful, and I hate that it leaves me... wonder at a thing loved despite hatred / Youth passes and a substitute comes after it... and gray hair goes, missing with the missing.' It was said: Al-Mundhir ibn Abi Sabra looked at Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali who was wearing a patched shirt and said to him: 'How patient you are with this shirt?' He said: 'Perhaps a boring thing cannot be parted with.' So he sent him a chest of clothes. Sulayman ibn Wahb looked in the mirror and saw gray hair, so he said: 'A fault, may we not lack it.' Mention of gray hair came in the correspondence of Al-Fadil, saying: 'Whoever climbs the peak of seventy descends to the bottom, and whoever lives a long life falls into the long and broad (trouble). The days of gray hair are all white (days), yet we are not of those who fast the White Days.' How delicate is the saying of Ibn al-Mu'taz: 'O soul, you have burdened me with my sins... O soul, desist from your desire and repent / And how can there be passion after youth has gone... and the scissors of my gray hair have cut the blame of my youth.' How sweet is the saying: 'O night traveler in the belly of a wasteland... to cross rough and smooth terrain in the desert / You have crossed the sand dune of gray hair and separated from it... and after the sand dune is nothing but the place of prayer.' And by some poet: 'When I saw gray hair appearing on my cheeks... I became certain that connection (Al-Wasl) is reaching me from you.' Perhaps one might understand from this verse something other than what the composer intended, imagining that he thinks gray hair is a cause for connection, which is contrary to the custom of poets, for they always say that gray hair is the cause of beautiful women fleeing from lovers. How beautiful is the saying of Khalid al-Katib regarding this:",

    "text": "'When she saw gray hair befalling my parting... she turned away the turning of a beautified partisan / And I began to seek her connection with humility... while gray hair signaled her not to do so.' The poet intended this customary meaning. Wasil bin Ata al-Ghazal, the head of the Mu'tazila, had a distinct lisp in the letter Ra, so he used to avoid the Ra in his speech, and you would hardly hear a word from him containing a Ra. It is said he was tested to read the beginning of Surah Bara'ah (at-Tawbah), so he read without thought or deliberation: 'A covenant from Allah and His Prophet to those you have covenanted from the corrupt (Fasiqin - instead of Mushrikin which has Ra), so wander in the earth two crescents by two crescents (Hilalayn Hilalayn - instead of Arba'at Ashhur/Four Months).' It reached him that Bashar ibn Burd satirized him, so he said without thinking: 'Has the time not come for this blind atheist surnamed Abu Mu'adh to have someone kill him? By Allah, were it not that assassination (Ghila) is a trait of the Ghaliyah (sect), I would have sent someone to slit (Yab'aj - instead of Baqara) his belly on his lying place (Mudtaja' - instead of Firash), then he would only be a Sadusi or 'Uqayli.' He said 'blind' (A'ma) and did not say 'sightless' (Darir), he said 'atheist' (Mulhid) and did not say 'disbeliever' (Kafir), he said 'Abu Mu'adh' and did not say 'Bashar ibn Burd' or 'Al-Mar'i', he said 'assassination' (Ghila) and did not say 'treachery' (Ghadr), he said 'Ghaliyah' and did not say 'Mughiriyah' or 'Mansuriyah', he said 'sent' (Ba'athtu) and did not say 'dispatched' (Sayyartu), he said 'slit' (Yab'aj) and did not say 'rip open' (Yabqar), he said 'lying place' (Mudtaja') and did not say 'bed' (Firash). By mentioning 'Uqayl and Sadus, he referred to Bashar ibn Burd's claim of belonging to them. Some poet praised him saying: 'He turns wheat (Burr) into Qamh in his speech... and avoided the Ra until he devised a trick for poetry / He could not handle rain (Matar) and speech rushed him... so he came with Ghaith out of fear of Matar.' For this reason, the poet said that verse. He compared connection (Wasl) to Wasil, and compared gray hair to the Ra. His meaning is that she shuns him with the shunning of Wasil for the Ra. Another said and did better: 'Prepare a lisp, if Wasil were present... to hear it, Wasil would not have dropped the Ra.' Al-Ramadi said regarding a beautiful lisping person: 'Neither does the Ra hope for connection (Wisal), nor do I... Abandonment brings us together, so we are alike / If I am alone, I write it on my palm... and sit wailing, I and the Ra.' Al-Arjani said: 'Wasil bin Ata abandoned the Ra... in addressing the people among the orators / And I will abandon the Qaf and the Ra... along with the Dad from the letters of the alphabet.' Discussion of a model of Ibn al-Athir's composition. He said: 'Likewise, I wrote a letter of this type to some friends, joking with him, so I said: He should thank me for branding him with my satire instead of my praise, for I only named him so that the sacrificial animal (Udhiyah) would be prohibited through him on the Day of Sacrifice (Adahi). There is no doubt that our master is counted among the cattle (An'am), except that he is of those with horns, and horns are equipment in dispute.' I say: What meaning is this to boast about? And saying: 'This is a meaning I invented and have not heard from anyone before me.' If he had limited himself to the first two rhymed phrases, it would have been better than explaining their meaning afterwards. He removed the splendor of wit and humor by what he brought of explanation. It has been said that the condition of humor is that it should not be hidden nor explicit, but in between. Do you not see the saying of Al-Siraj al-Warraq regarding one named Al-Safi: 'Accidents intervened between me... between Al-Safi and me / So I will not die until... I see Al-Safi with my eye.' How sweet it is. If he had said: 'So I will not die until I see him as a pure friend (Safi)' or 'with one eye', meaning one-eyed, it would not have this charm, nor this beauty that strikes the heart. Or if he began to explain it afterwards and clarify what he symbolized, this sweetness would have gone. Look at how beautiful is the saying of Al-Jazzar Abu al-Husayn, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him: 'If the Butcher (Jazzar) hunted the souls of enemies... on the day of your Eid, I would be the first hunter / But they felt safe from my knife due to their deficiency... Indeed, the sacrifice is not (valid) with a defective one.' And his saying also: 'I advised you, so listen to the advice of a lover... and I am indeed trustworthy in what I said / It is of sound opinion that you do not cause war between us... for I am a butcher and you are fat.' If he (Ibn al-Athir) had said: 'He should thank me for branding him with my satire among creation, for I only named him so that the sacrificial animal would be prohibited through him,' it would have been better. For his saying: 'The sacrificial animal on the Day of Sacrifice' is like saying: 'Eid on the day of Eid,' and 'Fasting on the day of fasting.' It is known that 'Dahaya' (sacrifices) is only applied to what is slaughtered during the days of Tashriq, and what is slaughtered of animals at other times is not called that. Likewise, the Friday prayer (Jumu'ah) is only applied to the known prayer at the specific time, and if there is a prayer at another time, it is not Jumu'ah. A model of Ibn al-Athir's composition claiming creativity.",

    "text": "But it was nothing but that he said after that verse: 'O you whom I do not name nor use a kunya for, and I mention another while he is the one I mean. Do not be among those given the kingdom of beauty and did not look at its demise, and knew his place in hearts and was unjust in his coyness. Do not be deceived by the saying of one who saw beauty as an eraser of bad deeds. And know that the blamer says: Humility is enough of a blamer. Often love vanishes due to the crimes of rejection, and increase in the definition (hadd) is a decrease in the defined (mahdud). It has been said: Beauty has a Zakat (alms-tax) like the Zakat of wealth, and its Zakat according to the scholars of love is nothing but expression of connection (Wisal). This is a charity distributed to its owners, and one does not wait for the year (hawl) to pass to make it obligatory. Rather, it is continuous with the renewal of days. Those deserving of it are one category, and it is not said that they are eight categories. These are the ones specified for freeing slaves (necks), and the neck of love is more bound than a neck freed by a contract (Kitabah). So exit, O my master, from this obligatory right, otherwise you come to a seeker of desires, and what a seeker. And do not say this is a debtor who counts the nights in his procrastination, and I promise him and promises are provision for his like. For this is a commodity with which you dealt with me once mocking and once enchanting. And among the circulating proverbs is that experience makes the naive skilled. By my life, the practice of love renews knowledge for its owner, and insight even if he is, as is said, blind. The sayer lied: Expose the one you love to love... then leave him for Iblis to tame him. If the training is, as said, for Iblis, I do not see him having done anything in what he did. I see you resisted him with the resistance of a full-grown horse while you are young. There is no doubt that you demolish the building he constructs, and that you are an exception among those who entered the rule of exception. I am now a fault-finder of him, and blaming him. So where are his whisperings which are more deceptive than traps? And where is his saying: I will come to them from the right and the left? And where are his soldiers who steal what is in the sky, who run through them like the course of blood? All of this news has become void to me, just as his effect has become void to me. If arrogance overtakes him because I mocked the validation of his actions, let him untie the logic of this need of mine so I know he is capable of untying its knot. Otherwise, let him hide his head and erase his whispering. If he has a throne on the sea, let him dismantle his throne, and let him know that magic is not in his knot and blowing, but it is in the Yellow (gold/Dinar) and its inscription. Here I am, I have sent what makes resolve dissolved and affection granted. I only say that I sent a beloved (Dinar) to a beloved, and both have their place in the heart, rather the heart is created from her love. How noble it is while it is a means to its like; its beauty is from his beauty, even if its shape is not from his shape. No describer described it but that what he saw of it was above what he narrated. Among the strangest and best of its descriptions is that no two-faced person was seen as esteemed (Wajih) except it. There is no doubt that if it travels in a matter, it is subtle in opening its doors, and handles its roughness so it exchanges it with its arrow, and its distance so it exchanges it with its nearness. If I sent other than it, I would fear that it would not be truthful in its embassy, and that it would go as an ambassador and return as a lover. For there is no trust over beauty, and in its like betrayal is excused. There is no blame on minds if they forget the resolve of their guidance there, and see what the shoulder of their effort cannot bear. Who is the one whose armor is strong against those arrows, or seeks salvation from them when a barrier is placed between him and the desire? This is what prevented me except from sending a purse or a letter; one of them is beneficent in embassy, and the other is a veil over the secret. And peace, God willing.' I say: When he finished this letter, he began as usual to over-praise his speech for what he invented of mentioning Zakat and describing the Dinar in the sense of the Hadith, and that what occurred to him was not achieved by Al-Hariri nor did anyone precede him to it. I say: I have never heard nor seen, nor do I hear or see, anyone who corresponded with his beloved with such things, threatening that love vanishes with rejection, and increase in the definition is a decrease in the defined, and that connection is a Zakat obligatory upon you, and do not say it is annual but at all times, so exit from this obligatory right upon you, and do not say I am a debtor easy to seek, for how much do you mock me? I am not as I was, and experience makes the naive skilled. Then he began condemning Iblis, scolding and rebuking him, saying that he is not the owner of whispering, seduction, and magic, but it belongs to the Dinar, and here I have prepared something of that. Nothing remained after that but to equip the beloved to the beloved (the coin to the person). Then he began describing the Dinar. Yes, this expression and threat are suitable for the right of an enemy who exited from friendship to enmity, or a ruler of most injustice and corruption in the land and people, whom neither warning nor caution benefited, or a slave who exited the obedience of his master and did not fear his authority.",

    "text": "He said in a section mentioning a gift of fresh dates (Rutab) to some kings of the Levant: 'When the road carried it alone, envy arose for other fruits, a desire; and there was none of them but said: Oh, I wish I were fresh dates (Rutab).' I say: What eloquence is in this expression, and what rhetoric is upon this meaning which has no benefit under it? Where is this compared to the saying of Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar: 'I said when the cupbearer poured... the wine upon the ground / Out of jealousy for it from me... I wish I were dust.' For this one brought the wording of the Great Quran, so it had an impact on the hearing and sweetness in the heart. If his saying 'I wish I were fresh dates' was part of a verse, or part of a couplet, or part of a proverb or a meaning circulated in something, and he transferred it to this, it would have been good. And from the speech of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, in answer to the Caliph: 'The letter arrived containing what revealed the title of intention, even if it was a book, and affirmed the blessing even if it rose and was a cloud (Sahab), requiring the limit of obedience. And to that noble foot the believer says: I wish I were dust.' Then Ibn al-Athir said: 'And there was none of them but said (Man Qala).' So he applied 'Man' (who - for rational beings) to what is irrational. And it is only for rational beings. And fruits do not reason. If he had said: 'And there was no type of them but said,' he would have escaped that. It might be excused for him that when he placed the types of fruit in the position of rational beings in speech, he applied 'Man' to them. Like the Almighty's saying: 'Then He said to it and to the earth, Come willingly or unwillingly. They said: We come obediently (Ta'i'in).' This plural form expressed with letters is only for rational beings. But when He placed them in the position of rational beings in speech and obedience, He gave them the plural of rational beings. The answer: This is not like that. The difference between the noble verse and his speech is that in the noble verse, He applied that because their speech preceded. So it indicated that they were placed in the position of rational beings. As for Ibn al-Athir, he applied 'Man' to what is irrational from the first instance, so it was not good. With the likes of this, Al-Mutanabbi escaped the criticism of Ibn Waki' and others against him, in his saying: 'And everything that Allah created... and what He did not create is despised in my ambition... like a hair in my parting.' They said: Among what Allah Almighty created are the Prophets, Messengers, and Angels. This implies declaring him a disbeliever and indicates his heresy. The answer regarding Al-Mutanabbi is that he said 'And everything that (Ma)' and did not say 'And everyone who (Man)'. For 'Ma' is for the irrational according to the correct view. By this, the Messengers exit from it due to the honor of their rank and the elevation of their station above this, and the Angels, peace and blessings of Allah be upon them. Similarly, some ignorant people raised an objection to His Almighty's saying: 'Indeed, you and what you worship other than Allah are the firewood of Hell.' He said: And among them are those who worshipped the Messiah. The bereft one did not know that 'Ma' in His Almighty's saying 'and what you worship' is for the irrational. So it covers idols, stars, and the like, and excludes the Messiah, peace be upon him, from that. Discussion of a letter by Ibn al-Athir from a lover to a beloved. He said: 'Among that is an occurrence regarding which some of my friends tasked me to dictate to them, and it is a tender note from a lover to a beloved.' Then he began to list it, and it is long. He opened it with the saying of the poet: 'And when it is said: Whom do you love? My tongue... skips you, while you are that one in the heart.' When I saw that he started the letter with the verse of Abu Tammam, I said: 'Perhaps behind this lightning is rain, and he holds to this vanguard in gentleness according to the custom of addressing lovers, their submission, and the humility of their asking in seeking connection, or complaining of abandonment, or the tenderness of blame in breaking a promise or inclining to the opposite. For if tenderness, kindness, and submissiveness were created for anything, I do not see anyone more deserving of them than lovers in these stations.' How sweet is the saying of the poet: 'He passes from his palm a wine... more delicious than the negligence of the watcher / As if, when clarified and presented... it is the complaint of a lover to a beloved.'",

    "text": "I do not think of this beloved except that he had resolved to visit this lover, but the messenger intercepted him on the road with this letter and the Dinar. When he stood upon it and saw this 'favor' and the obligation placed upon him, he turned back after cursing the messenger, tearing his clothes, plucking his beard, spitting in his face, cursing the one who sent him, tearing the paper into shreds, trampling the crumbs of the paper with his feet, and saying whatever insults came to mind. He would elaborate on the right of the letter writer with what he deserves and throw the Dinar he sent into the air. At that, he would be brief, and silent about his wrong, not victorious. Did he not stand upon the poetry of the enamored Arabs who addressed their loved ones and pleaded in seeking connection, and were gentle in seeking satisfaction and help with love? Is this how Qays ibn Dharih, Abdullah ibn al-Ajlan al-Nahdi, Urwa ibn Hizam, Abu Dhu'ayb, Qays al-Majnun, Jamil Buthayna, and Kuthayyir Azza spoke? Is this how Umar ibn Abi Rabi'a, Al-Harith ibn Khalid, and Al-Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf flirted? Did he not hear the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'Increase my soul in pain, I will increase in love for you... The most ignorant of people is a lover who holds a grudge.' And the saying of Abu Firas: 'He did evil, so the evil increased him in favor... A beloved, despite what came from him, is a beloved / The two slanderers count his sins against me... And from where can a beautiful face have sins?' And the saying of the other: 'If it saddened me that you touched me with an offense... It pleased me that I crossed your mind.' And the saying of the other: 'Your abandonment indicates... That I crossed your minds.' Did he not hear the saying of Al-Ma'arri: 'For other than me is Zakat of beauty, so if there is... Zakat of beauty, then remember a wayfarer (Ibn Sabil).' How sweet is the saying: 'So remember a wayfarer.' If she pays Zakat of beauty, he did not order her to spend it on him nor make it obligatory upon her, but said: If there is anything, then remember the wayfarer who is deserving. Of this is the saying of Kuthayyir Azza: 'If the coolness of her upper teeth is gifted... To one poorer than me, then I am indeed poor.' Although its meaning is problematic if you contemplate it deeply, and this is not the place to discuss it. How delicate is Ibn Sana' al-Mulk in his saying: 'And a beauty who has not passed twenty years (Hujjah)... I say to her a saying in which is correctness / Upon you is Zakat, so make it our connection... For your life is in the twenties, and that is a Nisab (threshold for Zakat).' And the saying of Nasir al-Din ibn al-Naqib: 'Zakat of beauty has become obligatory upon you... And in it, like in wealth, is a right / So do not turn it away from me, for I am... The poor one deserving of its expenditure.' Did he not hear the saying of Jamil ibn Ma'mar al-Udhri: 'There is no good in love that stands still, not moved... By accidents of despair, or frequented by greed / If her patience or my anxiety were with her... I would know what to do and what to leave.' And the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'And the sweetest love is that whose owner doubts the connection... And in abandonment, he is forever fearing and guarding.' And the saying of Kushajim: 'Were it not for the chase of hunting, there would be no pleasure... So chase me with connection a little / This drink is the brother of life, and it has... No pleasure until it hits a thirst.' And the saying of Al-Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf: 'And the best of the days of passion is your day which... Is frightened by abandonment and by blame / If there is no anger or satisfaction in love... Then where are the sweetnesses of messages and letters?' And the saying of Ulayya bint al-Mahdi: 'Love is placed upon injustice, so if... The beloved were fair in it, it would be ugly / It is not approved in the law of passion... For a lover to be good at composing arguments.' Did he not hear the saying of Muhammad ibn Bashir al-Khariji: 'I wanted patience from you, but hindered me... An attachment in my heart from your love, old / It remains despite the doubt of time and its changes... And despite your harshness, indeed it is noble.' How beautiful is the saying of Al-Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf when he scolded his loved ones for procrastination in connection: 'As if there was no passion between me and you... And my rope was not connected to your rope / And indeed, I am shy for you from a narrator... Who narrates about you regarding boredom and procrastination.' Al-Shibli, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, narrated saying: 'I saw on a Friday a madman at the Mosque of Rusafa standing naked saying: I am the madman of Allah, I am the madman of Allah. I said: Why do you not enter the mosque, cover yourself, and pray? He recited saying: They say visit us and fulfill the duty of our right... But my state has dropped their rights from me / When they saw my state and did not disdain it... And did not disdain from it, I disdained them for myself.'",

    "text": "I said: This is another type different from what we are discussing, and the paths of seriousness are different from the paths of joking. Among what I said: 'And if my secret is exposed in passion tomorrow... and the night-talkers speak of my ardor / Or it is said: This poor one, the origin of his madness... is the magic of eyes, and he has no helpers / Is this permissible in the law of passion? And who... issued a fatwa that the blood of the lover is unavenged (Jabbar)? / I knew that your love is the origin of my affliction... So upon your rejection, not upon me, is the shame.' Did he not hear what lovers were content with, like Jamil where he says: 'I am content from you, O Buthayna, with that which... If the slanderer knew it, his anxieties would settle / With \"No\" and \"I cannot\" and with hope... And with the promise until the procrastinator becomes bored of the promise / And with the hasty glance, and with the year passing... Its ends, while we do not meet at its beginnings.' And Jahdar where he says: 'Does not the night gather the mother of Amr... And us? So that is closeness for us / She looks at the crescent as I see it... And the day rises over her as it rose over me.' And the other where he says: 'Look at the flying vulture (star) every night... For I am looking at it in the evening / Perhaps my eye and your eye will meet at it... So we both complain of what the consciences conceal.' And Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri where he says: 'He met you in the year that passed and did not... Ask you except for a kiss in the coming (year) / Indeed, the miser, when the span is extended for him... In generosity, giving the gift becomes easy for him.' As for his mentioning Iblis, calling for his help, and urging his whispering and adorning falsehood to him, it is strange. Does he not know that if a lover says to his beloved: 'Nothing makes you visit me and be affectionate to me except Iblis with his whispering,' the beloved will visualize that before his eyes and say: 'Indeed, these matters are from the act of Iblis and obeying Satan in following prohibited taboos.' So he returns to abandonment and puts on the slogan of harshness, repulsion, and turning away. He would be like a sleeper whom another woke from negligence. Some said: I had a friend who was not shy with me nor I with him. He said to me one day: 'O my brother, you know my love for so-and-so, and I have never been able to get anything from her. She visited me today, and I would like you to be with us, for I am not shy with you.' I agreed to that. When I came to his place, and my eye fell on the girl, I saw the most beautiful of women. Then we indulged in eating, drinking, and talking. My friend asked me to sing, and I was good at it. It was as if Allah Almighty made me forget everything I memorized except this tune: 'Of the modest women, she did not disgrace her brother... And did not raise a shame for her father.' When the girl heard it, she said: 'You did well, by Allah! Repeat it, O my brother.' So I repeated it. She jumped up standing and said: 'I am repentant to Allah. By Allah, I would not disgrace my brother nor raise shame for my father.' The young man strove for her return, but she did not do so and left. He said to me: 'Woe to you, what made you do what you did?' I said: 'By Allah, it is not something I intended, but it was cast upon my tongue.' Look at the benefit of what I mentioned. The most appropriate in seeking connection is to say: 'I ask Allah to incline your heart towards me, inspire you to seize the reward in me, and grant you mercy for me so that you may enter Paradise.' As the poet misled his beloved in his saying: 'You accused me of a sin while I was not a sinner... And burdened me in love with what I cannot bear / My seeking of connection is not greed for survival... But it is a reward I drive to you.' And as the other misled where he said: 'Rise with us, may my soul be your ransom... Let us make doubt certainty / For how long, O my beloved... Will the speaker sin regarding us?' I have stood upon part of a letter from the speech of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk, which is: 'And I, by Allah, am defeated in your matter. The reason is that I am the lover and you are the beloved. I do not fight you so as to deceive you, nor do I betray your love, nor do I clatter against you so as to cheat you and distress your heart. Do what you wish, for I am the patient one. Kill how you wish, for I am the thankful one. Say to me, for I have hearing that loves your speech. Turn, you will see my hopes fluttering around you. Act, for you are excused. Be arrogant, for I am not harmed but pleased. Return to the affection that is between us, for every sin of yours is forgiven.' End. I said: And to Allah belongs the Vizier Abu al-Walid ibn Zaydun where he says: 'Between me and you is what, if you wished, would not be lost... A secret, if secrets were spread, would not be spread / O seller of his share of me, even if life were offered... To me for my share of him, I would not sell / It suffices you that if you burdened my heart with what... The hearts of people cannot bear, it would bear / Be arrogant, I will bear; be arrogant, I will be patient; be mighty, I will be humble... Turn away, I will approach; speak, I will listen; command, I will obey.'",

    "text": "And the other where he said: 'Far from it! Forgetfulness does not pull my rein... Ever, nor does blame win over my consolation / Cut the connection or turn away from me deliberately... The nature of passion is stamped on your desire, my character.' And Mahasin al-Shawa where he says: 'I submit, but he does not bring me near; I return, but he does not return... I refrain, but he does not refrain; I give generously, but he does not give / Be relaxed, I will be humble; be unjust, I will protect; threaten, I will return... Be content, I will contain; attack, I will connect; threaten, I will guide.' And where he says also: 'May I be your ransom, O one who feigned connection... And denied me connection in his love / For beauty has meanings in you by which... Women go astray and men are distracted / You frighten, are observed, show favor, are loved... You show enmity, are treated as an enemy, show loyalty, are treated with loyalty / O one upon whom I have staked the excess of wasting away of my body... In him, and my heart upon torture and hardship / Separate, bring near, cut, connect, reveal, hide, be stingy, be generous... Betray, fulfill, drag, be just, be angry, be pleased, live, die.' And the Vizier Abu Shuja' Fatik where he said: 'O one who sickened by his tyranny and harshness... My heart, and O one who left me as meat on a butcher's block / Be how you wish, for I do not hate what... Pleases you, even if what pleases you is shedding my blood / Turn away, expose, drag, abandon, repel, connect... Be rough, be soft, be pleased, be angry, forgive, take revenge / In every case, I am the criminal, the wrongdoer, and you... Are the beneficent, of good character and traits.' And Ibn Rawaha al-Hamawi: 'If my killing is sweet to you... Then increase the abandonment in my punishment / Perhaps the standing will be prolonged between me... And you by Allah in the Account.' This is more and more famous than to be cited as evidence. As for attributing magic and its knot to Iblis, it is strange. Magic and knots are only for humans to use Iblis and his soldiers; so magic is for the human, not the devil. How sweet is the saying of... when he cried out to Iblis out of wit: 'The wine, O Iblis, if you do not stand... And expand the trick in returning it / The market of sins will not sell, nor... Will you succeed, O Iblis, after it.' As for his claim in describing the Dinar as two-faced and that he was not preceded in it, the first to describe it as such was Al-Hariri, who said in his Maqamat: 'Perish it for a deceitful hypocrite... Yellow, two-faced like a hypocrite / Appearing in two situations to the eye of the observer... The ornament of a beloved and the color of a lover.' Mention of the Dinar came in the Maqamat of Badi' al-Zaman al-Hamadhani, saying: 'So accompany for me an enemy in the cloak of a friend, from the origin of brass, calling to disbelief (Kufr), dancing on victory (Zafar), like the circle of the eye, removing the weight of debt, and hypocrisy with two faces.' How beautiful is the saying of Nasir al-Din ibn al-Naqib, riddling about the Dinar: 'What is a thing people yearn for... The yearning of lovers for the beloved / They beat it and hung it, but... It increased in honor by the beating and hanging.' As for his saying: 'It goes as an ambassador and returns as a lover, and there is no trust over beauty,' it is taken from the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'What is wrong with us all, lovesick, O messenger... I love and your heart is the consumed one / Whenever the one I sent to her returned... He was jealous of me and betrayed in what he said / Her eyes corrupted the trusts between us... And hearts betrayed minds.' From here Al-Arjani also took it, saying: 'I swear, the breeze returned sick... When it traveled from me to you as a messenger / It came because of the suffering of your love, repeating... A breath that people steal, long / And it saw for your love that it had betrayed me... So it began dragging trails of shame.' And from here is the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk also: 'He went as a messenger and came to me as a lover... And an obstacle hindered him from my message / And he returned not with the answer but with burning passion... That silenced him while passion spoke through him.' However, Al-Arjani covered up his theft. He said in condolence for a wife who died and then her child died: 'The most saddening condolences are those in which a lost one is followed by a lost one, especially if it combines Sa'd al-Akhbiyah and Sa'd al-Su'ud.' Then he said: 'Neither he who wept nor he who lamented paid them their due, nor he who wrote poetry nor he who wrote letters. Would that one of them were ransomed by the other, so the one ransomed by gold lived as a dirham.' Then he listed the rest of the letter, which is long, lean, and ugly, except that after finishing it, he began to buzz and hum about the saying 'Sa'd al-Akhbiyah' and 'Sa'd al-Su'ud' and that they are two stations of the moon's stations, marveling at this agreement.

    "text": "I say: He blew into no fire, and circled around no sanctuary. That is not a great matter, nor something to call attention to after finishing it. Rather, it is of the middle rank; it does not descend to his usual lowness, nor does it rise to the height of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil. People have used the names of stations and stars in their speech seriously and jokingly. Like the saying of Saif al-Din al-Mashadd ibn Qizil: 'My heart went astray among your tents (Abyat)... And the winds (Ahwiyah) fan its fire / O slaughterer (Dhabih) of sleep with my eye, do you not... Have mercy on a heart that went astray in the tents (Akhbiyah).' And his saying also: 'O valley of al-Shaqraa... How many picnics you have gathered / Thickets whose water flows... There is no likeness to its goodness / And how many a full moon pleasing the eye... Became through you in the forehead (Jabhah).' And his saying also: 'He appeared in the armor like the spear... In the sides and the brownness / O God, what a full moon... Pleasing the eye in the nose-ring/Cancre (Nathrah).' And the saying of the notary Burhan al-Din ibn al-Faqih Nasr: 'In your service I did not attain benefit... And the scale of my deficiency through you is tipping / For in the eye from my tears is a scattering (Nathrah)... And in the heart from your fortune (Sa'd) is a slaughterer (Dhabih).' Among the best metonymies is the saying of another: 'Do you not see me enduring my passion for you... And bearing from you what cannot be borne / When the stars of the sky rose... And the Bucket (Dalw) leaned and the Cubit (Dhra') rose.' And the saying of Muhammad Sibt al-Ta'awidhi: 'So I spent the night and she spent the night by my side... Both of us counting the stations (Manazil) on her / She shows me the Belly (Butayn), but I... Reciprocate and show her the Claws (Zubana).' And the saying of another from verses: 'So I hastened him from entering the toilet... With obeyed ignorance and obeyed forbearance / So I drowned him with the star of the Belly... And he quenched me with the star of the Cubit.' As for his saying: 'Would that if one of them were ransomed by the other,' better than this is the saying of Al-Mutanabbi: 'Would that the rising of the two suns was absent... And would that the absent of the two suns did not set.' The completion of the rhyme (Saj') is half a verse from this poem by Abu al-Tayyib, the first of which is: 'Their time had divided the two persons between you... So the one ransomed by gold lived as a dirham.' He said: 'And from this chapter is what I mentioned in a hunting epistle describing pellet bows (Qasi al-Bunduq) and their bearers.' Then he quoted it. I say: It is also of the middle quality; it is neither in the high nor the low. I was reminded by the path he took in it of what came for some Persian writers, I think, regarding the bow for arrows. For it is unique in its beauty, quick in its wit to snatch minds, and its craftsmanship left no pleasure after it for souls in repetitions. It is: Epistle of Ibn al-Athir describing pellet bows and their bearers. 'And they ask you about Dhul-Qarnayn. Say, I will recite to you a mention of him. A sage molded on correctness, guiding to the paths of rectitude. Traces of his might are famous upon those of wood. And they ask you about the crescents (Ahillah). Say, yellow without illness. A galaxy from which shooting stars fall. A tower with two bodies rising with the ominous bird. A devil whose sun of victory rises between his horns. A rebellious one who does not calm down except by rubbing his ears. A composite image having no composition of organization, except what their backs carried, or the intestines, or what mixed with bone. A mount differing from other cattle; its standing is by hand and their standing is by feet. A moving thing biting on the molar of patience in adversity and prosperity. Whoever accompanied it for the blink of an eye walked on air. So say about Nun (the whale/fish) that swallowed a messenger (Jonah) then cast him into the wilderness. A shackled one upon whom the free is carried. Driven by the neck, suspended from the neck of his shoulder. Slender, he stuck his belly to his back, until the daughters of his chest appeared to onlookers, and his kidneys sank into his waist, due to the dominance of his attracting and holding powers over his pushing and destroying powers. Gripped, approaching the fast one, and separating from him at the cutting. A decrepit one upon whom century after century passed, so his back bent. His reclining place is not set up except on the hand. He recites when he opens his mouth: I stripped my bones of their flesh so I left them... Bare, exposed before you and restricted / Take my hand then uncover the garment, you will see... The wasting of my body, but I cover myself. Bent of back, leaning on a staff, he throws it and behold it is a snake moving. He avoided the spears of Khatt and the swords, his friends... As for the bent bows, he settled them and avoided.'",

    "text": "'He turned to taking spears from the daring men, and the stirrers of heroes handled them with the forearm. A humped instrument warning of death, and a lean curved one like the letter Nun. Emaciated ones yearning over the thickness of their livers, affectionate ones moaning for the separation of their children.

Appointed to seize souls, having wings, two or three or four. A worn-out one roaring when soft in a horn. Gathering to the belly of the youth the curvature of the old man. Exhausted, its aorta almost cut. Bent-backed, approaching the age of sixty...' It is long, filling a booklet, and all of it is of this model. A group opposed (imitated/competed with) it, among them Judge Nasir al-Din ibn al-Munir, who made three or more, and others. But none of them split dust for it (could match it), nor did anything run from the train behind it except what was stumbling. As for the pellet (Bunduq), our Sheikh Judge Shihab al-Din Abu al-Thana Mahmud, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, has a resonant epistle on it. The pearl crowds with the gold bead in it like seeds in a pomegranate. He recorded it in his book titled Husn al-Tawassul. It is of utmost beauty, and at the summit of literary classes. Were it not for its length, I would have recorded it here, and provided the poverty of this composition with its wealth. Ibn al-Rumi has a long 'Ayn-rhymed poem in Rajaz meter about the pellet and archers. And Muhammad Sibt al-Ta'awidhi has a poem about pellet shooting, the beginning of which is: 'Greetings, O abode of passion, from an abode... And may the pouring clouds not miss you.' It is of utmost beauty, and it is in his Diwan. Among the best of what I mentioned regarding the pellet bow is the saying of Ibn Waddah al-Mursi: 'Wonder at the generous bow, for it... Did not observe the right of the doves of the branches / It became a death for them while it was a sanctuary... And such is the ruling of the vicissitudes of time.' As for me, I wrote a decree (Tawqi') regarding arbitration between pellet archers; there is no harm in recording it here. It is: 'Praise be to Allah, whose praise has never ceased to be obligatory, whose support is a giver of every good, whose thanks attract blessings and block retributions, and whose remembrance removes misery and earns bliss. We praise Him for His blessings, for which we throw down varieties of birds with praise, and clip their wings with thanks so they have no power to fly. We bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, having no partner, a testimony with which we have no excuse for not winning Paradise, and by which we do not find our souls on the Day of Resurrection except in the crops of green birds. And we bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger, the best of those whom people of rank advanced, and the noblest of those who judged with justice stripped of doubt and suspicion. May Allah bless him and his family and companions, who were in wars its breaking eagles, and its knights who satiated the clawed and beaked (birds/beasts) with the flesh of enemies. How praised is the Archer in his aim, and feet strove for him in ranks, foot by foot. And peace be upon him abundantly. To proceed. Since shooting with pellets is an art undertaken by Caliphs and Kings, and Princes and Great Ones have followed a path in it of subtle taking and novel behavior, training with it during boredom to relax their souls, gathering fruits of desire in recreation from the trellises of their plants, appearing to what pleases the eye and frightens the bird in their outings, and attaining with clay pellets from birds what others do not attain with their hunting falcons or hawks. They have discarded the distractors of attachment in attaining high ranks, and donned the slogan of truthfulness among themselves while they are people of affection. They prevented their eyelids from approaching the watering places of sleep except briefly. They appeared with faces that are full moons and bows that are crescents. They moved in hunting eagles like the movement of the Rook (in chess). They hunted birds in the air when they scattered clay pills from every bow that is like a trap. They shouted over the strings, and the birds were drinking companions on the pure wine of waters, among its victims. They plucked the flowers of every garden that brought forth its water and pasture. This path needed controls to be observed in its conditions, and to drag the tails of its garments over the main road, so that every archer stands at the limit of his bird, and probes the depth of another by his precedence. To secure against dispute in ranks, and to save the people of this method from the fault-finder and blamer. The High Isfahsalaari, Amiri, Shihabi Seat (Majlis) was the one who dragged his cloak over the galaxy in it, and became the son of its root in knowledge and recognition. The birds rejoice at the melody of his strings, and the gallbladders of birds burst out of jealousy from the color of his dust. The galaxy wishes it were a path for him, the sun a pellet-holder, and the sky a flatterer. The colored rainbow wishes it were his bow, the Eagle (star) his bird, and the stars his pellets. How often has he made the embroidered robes of the garden contain what his hunting killed. How often did he go out in groups while the birds were lined up above them, so he hunted a full moon when he raced it. How often has he stained in the battlefield of the air a victim whose feathers were like woven chainmail. How often has he sent the pellet and it was a piercing arrow because it was of molded black mud.",

    "text": "'Therefore, the High, Mawlawi, Sultani, Maliki, Nasiri Command—may his omen remain blessed, and his pearl hidden in the drawers of compliance—has decreed that arbitration between pellet archers in protected Damascus be delegated to him, according to the custom of those before him in the established rule among archers. So let him undertake that with an authority in which he relies on the truth in the path of duty, and demonstrates his policy for which eyes stare, as if the tops of every eyelid were tied to an eyebrow. Let him observe the right of this path in keeping his covenant. Let him run on the familiar path of this sect, for every human being We have fastened his bird (fate/omen) to his neck, such that he places every deserving person in his rank which he does not exceed, accepts from the archer the claim of his game due to him, and rejects what the archers do not count and do not reckon. Being verified in what is brought to him for judgment, not letting a tail drag over his fault. Editing the matter of the victim regarding whom the archer has become, due to his infatuation, like Majnun Layla. Proceeding in that according to the familiar habit, and the rule which is described by the clear method. Let him receive this blessing with thanks by which he deserves an increase of every good, and recite verses of praise for this Solomonic command which judged him even regarding birds. And Allah undertakes his management, and reforms the exterior of his judgment and the secret. God willing.' Is it a condition of eloquent simile that the thing be compared to what is bigger and greater than it? He said in the eighth type of simile: It has been said: One of the conditions of eloquence in simile is to compare a thing to what is bigger and greater than it. From here, some writers of the people of Egypt erred in mentioning a fortress among the mountain fortresses, comparing it: 'A head (Hama) upon which the cloud is a turban, and a fingertip which the afternoon stained, and it is as if the crescent is a nail clipping for it.' Then he began to criticize this and say: What magnitude does a fingertip have to compare a fortress to it? And he prolonged with objection and answer. I say: Ibn Abi al-Hadid discussed this with him, and something of his criticism remains on this. It is that the one who claimed that eloquence of simile requires comparing a thing to what is bigger and greater, I discuss with him and say: On this basis, the predominance of the branch over the origin in simile is invalidated, and we declare wrong the likes of Dhu al-Rummah in his saying: 'And sand dunes like the hips of virgins I crossed... when the dark nights clothed them.' For he compared sand dunes to what is smaller and more insignificant than them, because the hips of virgins are less than dunes. Nor do we approve of the likes of the saying of Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Hashim: 'And Jupiter in the middle of the sky, you think it... while its light is like trembling mercury / A nail of yellow gold that I set... in a ring, and the stone is of turquoise.' For the sphere of the sky and Jupiter are bigger than the stone and the nail. Nor the saying of Ibn Qizil: 'A season as if the full moon in it is a singer... appearing, and its halo with it is his tambourine / And as if the rainbow is a gilded harp... and as if the downpour of rain is its strings.' Examples like this are many. And everything in the upper world cannot be compared to anything in the earthly world because it is more insignificant and smaller, just as the Pleiades are compared to a withered narcissus, the crescent to a nail clipping and a horseshoe, lightning to a sword, the sun to a mirror, stars to a lamp, and the rainbow to the trains of a bride. All that falls under this category would not be permissible to compare, and if done, it would not be eloquent according to this decision. Far from it! This blocks the door of beauty. As for fortresses, poets have compared them to fingertips. Among them is Al-Ghazzi where he says: 'Blocking the simple terrain, descending from the peak of the... lofty mountain to the bottom of the valley / Until the blessed fortress became a pinky finger... in a ring of thumb and steed.' Ibn al-Athir used that himself, saying in a previous section: 'We landed from it within sight and hearing, and surrounded it like the ring surrounds the finger.' Ibn Qizil compared them to the eye, saying: 'Indeed, fortresses are like eyes, their lashes are... their battlements, and their eyelids are the walls / Likewise their sockets are the trenches around them... and their guardians are the eyelashes.' Whoever criticizes the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil: 'And we descended at Qal'at Najm (Star Fortress), and it is a star in a cloud, and an eagle in an eagle (rugged place), and a head for which the cloud is a turban, and a fingertip which if the afternoon stained, it is as if the crescent is a nail clipping for it.' It is not appropriate for a debater debating him except to withhold speech about him. Is the attack on this anything but the saying of one who did not reach the bunch of grapes? 'As if your critic reveals your beauties... by it, and praises you to me and tempts me.' It suffices him that he criticized such expressions whose beauty dazzled when it appeared, and became in every side of its face a moon. Al-Fadil's saying resembles the saying of Ibn Khafajah: 'In a green hollow adorned with Arak trees... or the head of a mountain turbaned with clouds.'",

    "text": "And from the composition of our Sheikh Shihab al-Din Mahmud, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, describing a fortress: 'A fortress that wore the stars as earrings and the clouds as a tunic. Its top soared to the sky and its base anchored in the boundaries. You imagine the sun, when it rises, moving in its towers. And one who overlooks Suha (a star) thinks it is a wick in his lamp. Nothing of what is named 'bird' rises above it except the eagle of the sky and its Mirzam (star). Nothing gazes at the adorned women of its towers except the eye of the sun and the eyes that twinkle from its stars. Around it, of the mountains, is every lofty one; the eagle of the atmosphere fears crossing its rugged terrain. The winds stop weary if they climb its hills. Eyes fear, if they gaze at it, to traverse the sockets beneath it. Thought imagines the image of ascending to it, then does not reach it until hearts reach the throats. Around it, of valleys, are trenches; the months are not known from them except by their halves, and crescents are not known in them except by their descriptions.' Ka'b al-Ashqari said describing a fortress: 'Soaring beneath the sky as if it were... a summer cloud from which its rain has departed / The mountain goats do not reach its high peaks... nor the birds, except its eagle and vulture / The children of its people were never frightened by the wolf... nor did its dogs bark at anything but the stars.' The two Khalidis said: 'And a fortress whose bottom the Capella (Al-Ayyuq) embraced... and whose heights surpassed the belt of Gemini / The rain is not known when the clouds are at it... a land whose two sides are trodden by equals / When the cloud appears, its inhabitant wades... in its pools before its spouts pour / Its watchtower is counted among the stars of the spheres... if it were to run in their courses / On the peak of a lofty one, filled with might... with pride, while it is filled with fat / It has an eagle, the eagle of the atmosphere hovering... beneath it, so it is hidden in its coverts.' They also said regarding that: 'And a shaven one (fortress) that boasted over those who see it... with its high watchtower and difficult ascent / The atmosphere buttons the pocket of its clouds over it... and dresses it in a necklace of its shooting stars / When lightning travels, it appears through it... as the Virgin appears through the gaps of clouds / I soared to it with determination shining in the darkness... cutting in great matters and rising in difficulty / So I revealed it, with torn pocket by spears... and left it with cheek stuck to the dust.' Discussion regarding simile in the verses of a poet. He said in the second type of simile, after citing the poet's saying: 'As if it (the wine) and as if the bearer of its cup... when he stood polishing/displaying it to the drinking companions / Were the morning sun dancing, so dotted its face... the full moon of darkness with the stars of Gemini.' That he compared the cupbearer to the full moon, the wine to the sun, and the bubbles upon it to the stars. I say: He claimed that he compared three things to three things. But he did not compare the cupbearer, nor is there in the two verses anything indicating his comparison. However, the poet imagined that he compared the cupbearer and did not mention him, and Ibn al-Athir, may Allah have mercy on him, imitated him in his illusion. Their meaning is: The wine in its bubbles is as if it were a sun that danced, so the full moon dotted it with stars, using its dancing as a metonymy for its agitation when mixed. Mentioning the full moon here is good because it accompanies the stars, and it is the largest of them in the view of the eye, not in the mind if one thinks about astronomy. So it was appropriate for it to have the stars at its disposal to dot the sun with them. Mentioning the full moon here is a matter by way of digression; when he mentioned the dots, he wanted to attribute their action to a doer from whom they issued, so it was appropriate to mention the full moon. If it were deleted from the speech, the meaning would be complete in the origin, as is said: 'As if the wine is a sun that danced and was dotted with stars.' The poet established the tool of simile for the cupbearer in his saying: 'As if it and as if the bearer of its cup.' But he did not bring a stored comparison for him. So the poet is deluded, and Ibn al-Athir is an imitator, and both of them were deceived by the mention of the country (Note: Likely meant 'Full Moon' - Badr, misprint in text or context). For the custom has been to compare the cupbearer to the full moon, and the wine to the sun. Like the poet's saying: 'Pour it for me, daughter of a vine... aged ten and five / A moon bearing a sun... spent the night displaying it to us.' And the saying of another: 'And a cupbearer like the crescent circulating a sun... to the companions in something like the crescent.' And the saying of Ibn al-Rumi: 'I saw him with the cup between a mouth... of his and five fingers / So as if it and as if its drinker... are a moon kissing the cheek of the sun.'",

    "text": "If the poet had compared the cupbearer, he would have said: 'A sun circulated by a full moon' or 'carried by it.' These two verses are famous among literary people, and perhaps no one noticed this criticism. I do not say: Because the poet introduced the indicators of simile to the stir of dust and their swords, and brought one object of comparison which is the night, and his saying: 'its stars falling' is in the position of an adjective for the night, so it is an appendage of the night. If he had said: 'A night whose stars fall, and lightning marks it and dawn variegates it,' all of that would be nothing but the object of comparison. If it were a case of comparing two to two, he would have said: 'A night and stars falling.' As Imru' al-Qais said: 'As if the hearts of birds, wet and dry... at her nest are jujubes and withered dates.' This which I mentioned is established on the touchstone of examination, not a claim devoid of evidence and proof. Al-Akawwak has a verse which is the verse of Bashar ibn Burd. It is: 'As if the rising of dust and the white swords around it... are the height of a night that revealed stars.' How beautiful is the saying of Ibn Qadi Mila: 'We spent the night by the Euphrates circulating it... at night, so the Nile shone from its brilliance / As if it were a sun and the hand of its circulator... among us was mid-morning and the mouth of the companion was late afternoon.' The saying of Abu Yazid al-Asi is more appropriate than this, for he said: 'The envier who blamed him for... seeing smallpox on his cheek faulted him / But his face is like a full moon... upon which they placed the Pleiades as a veil.' Because the Pleiades may be seen with the full moon, whereas stars are not seen with the sun. It can be said about it: For this reason he said: 'dotted it out of joy with stars,' for whoever is dotted with something has become distinct from it and separated. It is also possible to interpret the two verses cited by Ibn al-Athir, but it is far-fetched. Discussion of models of simile from Ibn al-Athir's composition. He said in Simile: 'Among that is what I wrote as part of a letter to the Divan of the Caliphate mentioning the descent of the disbelieving enemy upon Acre. I said: The enemy surrounded it as lips surround the front teeth (Thughur - also means frontiers), and descended upon it like the descent of darkness upon light.' I say: There is no exaggeration in that, because lips do not surround the teeth. Encompassing (Ihata) is the inclusion of the surrounded by the surrounder from every side, like the circle around the dot, the element of water around the globe of the earth, and the white of the eye around the black. As for lips, they are covering, not surrounding. The perfect example of that is the saying of Al-Hariri, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him: 'And groups of people surrounded him, like the halo surrounding the moon and the calyxes surrounding the fruit.' And the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil: 'He preserved it with a preservation breaking habits, and made his favors surround necks like the surrounding of necklaces.' Lips are not like that; they only cover the exterior, not the interior. His saying: 'descent of darkness upon light' is not bad, relating disbelievers to darkness, and the frontier of Acre to light because it was in the hands of believers. How sweet is the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, in a letter regarding the conquest of Tiberias: 'The servant reached Tiberias in the morning and attacked it like the attack of a phantom (in dreams), and broke its virginity with the sword.' He said: 'Among that is what I mentioned in a section of a letter to some friends, saying: I compared his letter in its arrival and contraction only to the look of the beloved in his approach and turning away. Both matters are like an arrow in the pain of its impact and the pain of its extraction. And the yearning one is he whose passion is famous in the states of his connection and disconnection.' I say: This is taken from the saying of the poet... 'Woe to him if she looks and if she turns away... The impact of arrowheads and their extraction is painful.' Skill in simile in a verse by Al-Buhturi. He said, citing the saying of Al-Buhturi: 'You see him in the darkness of war and imagine him... a moon charging at men with a star.' In this simile are three things against three things, for he compared the dust to darkness, the praised one to the moon, and the spearhead to the star. This is rare beauty. I say: This is of the type previously mentioned regarding his saying on the poet: 'As if it and as if the bearer of its cup...' the two verses. There the poet was deluded and he imitated him, and here he is alone in the delusion without Al-Buhturi, because Al-Buhturi did not say: 'You see him in the dust of war when he charges at men with his spear, a moon roaming in the darkness with a star.' If the verse were understood this way, it would be a comparison of three to three. But there is nothing in the verse except one simile because he said: 'You see him in the darkness of war and imagine him a moon.'",

    "text": "This is the meaning upon which the verse is built. As for his saying: 'charging at men with a star,' it is one of the appendages of the moon. Do you not see that the sentence is in the accusative position as an adjective for 'moon'. It is strange that he claimed Al-Buhturi compared dust to darkness, whereas Al-Buhturi made the dust itself darkness. If the mention of darkness had come in the second hemistich of the verse, it would have entered into the object of comparison and been included between the moon and the star, but its mention came in the original subject of comparison. How beautiful is the saying of Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad: 'When you stormed the war armored... and veiled your face with the helmet / We considered your face the morning sun... upon which is a cloud of ambergris.' And the saying of Ibn al-Zaqqaq: 'If you were witnessing him while he covered the war... strutting in a flowing coat of iron / You would have seen from him, while the sword was in his hand... a sea shedding the blood of enemies with a stream.' And the saying of Al-Ghazzi: 'Stabbing has robbed the spearheads of their color... so what was blue became dyed red (safflower) in the upper chests / And our swords in the coats of mail are as if they are... streams flowing between blossoming flowers.' And his saying also: 'How many a blamed war from which you do not distinguish... from its knights except the blades and the eyes / Wading in blood that turned red under its smooth armor... as anemones grow around a pond.' This is taken from the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: 'His horses are accustomed not to chew grain... if the heads are not raised beside the nosebags / And they do not approach ponds unless their water... is from blood like basil under anemones.' Among what I said in this genre: 'And swords, when they pass into wounds... I said this is violet in anemone / The body seeks its soul from their blades... and their blood is between the Naqa and the Aqiq (places/colors).' As for what resembles the saying of Al-Buhturi cited by Ibn al-Athir, it is the saying of Abu Firas, I think: 'You returned from them with spoils, and their hearts... had in them a dragging army due to fear of you / And you came with the spear preceding you, as came... the deceiving star before the morning.' He said: 'Among the cold (bad) similes is the saying of Abu al-Tayyib: And red blood flowed upon the leaves... so it was like oranges (Naranj) on branches.' I say: By my life, he is excused in this, and it is one of the slips of Al-Mutanabbi in which he falls low. This verse is from that poem which he opened with his saying: 'Opinion is before the bravery of the brave... it is first and that is the second place' - the five verses. Look at this opening, and the wisdom and proverbs that follow it with eloquence and rhetoric. In this poem is the like of his saying: 'And they imagined play, war, and stabbing in the... battle other than stabbing in the square.' And from it describing the defeated enemy: 'Rain of clouds covers them, detailed... with sword, spear, and lance.' And before the verse cited by Ibn al-Athir: 'The trees of the mountains blackened their hair... as if there were hovering crows in it.' When Abu al-Mutarrif ibn Abi Bakr al-Makhzumi reversed the meaning of Abu al-Tayyib in comparing an orange in a river, it came out beautiful. For he said: 'And a view whose beauty kept me awake... of a blue (water) flowing like a speckled snake / I saw it carrying an orange... floating, red like dragon's blood / And the east wind rolled it on its surface... when it set out throwing it / So I thought it a sword of war drawn... shaken, and containing a drop of blood.' Ibn Fathun said regarding that: 'The water over its purity has an orange... floating in it while its waves ripple / Red, deep in color, as if it is... a star glowing in the middle of the galaxy.' So he conveyed the meaning in two verses, and Abu al-Mutarrif in four, so he prolonged. The saying of Abu al-Mutarrif reminded me of the saying of Al-Qadi Iyad, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him: 'As if the crops and their heads... when the hands of the winds appeared in them / Were battalions fleeing in defeat... Anemones in them were wounds.' Discussion of another model from Ibn al-Athir's composition. He said in the first section of the fourth type regarding Iltifat (Apostrophe/Grammatical Shift), after discussing the Iltifat in Surah Al-Fatiha from address to third person, and finishing that: 'Look at this place, and the harmony of these noble meanings, which feet almost tread upon and understandings, despite their proximity, overlook.'",

    "text": "I say: Is this how one speaks after mentioning the secrets of the Noble Quran and clarifying its obscurities? What benefit is there in his saying: 'Noble meanings' and his politeness in saying 'feet almost tread upon them!' It would have been better if he had said: 'Look at these noble meanings, how their suns have become exposed, and insights are distracted from perceiving their light.' Or to say: 'Crowns almost fall upon the partings (of hair), and minds are devoid of necklaces from its arranged pearls.' Iltifat in some verses. He said regarding Iltifat, citing the Almighty's saying: 'Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke' - the verse. He only shifted from the third person to the address in His Almighty's saying: 'And We adorned the nearest heaven' because a group of people other than those following religious law believe that stars are not in the nearest heaven, and that they are not for protection or stoning. So when the speech reached here, He shifted from addressing the absent to addressing Himself because it is important among the importances of rhetoric in belief, and it contains a denial of the denying sect believing in its falsehood. I say: Their belief that they are not in the nearest heaven and not for stoning is a type based on the belief in the pre-existence of the world, and that Allah Almighty is a cause by essence without the creation of the world and the Choosing Doer. According to what he established, attributing the action in creating the heavens in two days, and inspiring its affair in them to the Speaker, would be more appropriate than being a report about another, because it is the Origin. Care for the Origin is more appropriate than care for the Branch, because if the Origin is established, the Branch is established, and not vice versa. If this were more appropriate, He would not have shifted from it. But He shifted from it for a wisdom that did not appear to Ibn al-Athir. Inserting Grammar. He said in the fourth type regarding emphasizing two pronouns: Perhaps it is said in this place: Pronouns are mentioned in grammar books, so what need is there to mention them here? He did not know that grammarians do not mention what I mentioned, because this is specific to eloquence and rhetoric, and those do not address it. They only mention the number of pronouns, and that the detached ones are such and the attached are such, and do not go beyond that. As for me, I presented in this type a matter outside the grammatical matter. I say: The grammar of the ancients was mostly meanings (Ma'ani) and rhetoric (Bayan), such as Al-Rummani, Abu Ali al-Farisi, and Ibn Jinni despite their later time. Most of what is now recorded in the science of Ma'ani is mentioned in the books of those people. But when Imam Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani came, he stripped these points which are not syntax necessarily, gathered them, recorded them, categorized them, and arranged them, so it became a science standing on its own head. People after him, like Al-Sakkaki and others, became alert and doors opened for them. For this reason, whoever is not masterful in grammar cannot speak on this. Do you not see that Al-Zamakhshari, when he was knowledgeable in grammar, found easy in his exegesis what was not easy for others? By his ability in syntax and looking into the secrets of Arabic and explaining its rules, he presented those problems and answered them with those dancing answers. Through grammar, he extended, became skilled, and deepened, and his training in the arts of poetry and prose alerted him to that. Even Imam Fakhr al-Din in his exegesis, you see him in all other sciences not imitating anyone, but when Ma'ani and Bayan come, he imitates Al-Zamakhshari in that and says: 'Mahmud al-Khwarizmi said' and 'The author of Al-Kashhaf said.' For this reason, scholars said: Whoever looks into Al-Kashhaf and is not knowledgeable in Arabic and principles of religion becomes a Mu'tazilite. The establishment of the science of Ma'ani and Bayan resembles nothing but Fiqh (Jurisprudence). For jurists in ancient times, among the Tabi'un, were only Hadith scholars. When Abu Hanifa, may Allah be pleased with him, came, he recorded Fiqh and established its rules, and measured what no Hadith reached him about against what Hadith had reached him about. People came after him and extended the ropes in it, and doors were opened for them. Jurists became unique with this science from the Hadith scholars. Jurists specialized in knowing rulings and deduction, and left the knowledge of Hadith paths, names of narrators, and its sound from its sick to the Hadith scholars. For this reason, you hear them say: So-and-so is of the Hadith-scholar Jurists. The notables of jurists were only distinguished by their undertaking of the art of Hadith. Look at the Imams of the schools like Al-Shafi'i, Abu Hanifa, Malik, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Abu Dawood al-Zahiri, Al-Thawri, Al-Awza'i, and Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib, may Allah be pleased with them; you find them among the great Hadith scholars.",

    "text": "It is said: The reason Abu Hanifa established Fiqh and recorded it is that in his time, two men came to a bathhouse and entrusted the owner with a deposit that had a form, and they entered the bath. Then one of them came out, asked for the deposit, took it, and went on his way. When the other came out, he asked the bathhouse keeper for it. He told him: Your friend went out and took it. So he went to the judges of that time and complained to them. They obligated the keeper to pay it to the present adversary and said to him: You were negligent; it was your duty not to give the deposit except to both of them together as they entrusted you together. The man remained in confusion, not knowing what to do. Abu Hanifa met him and asked him about his state when he saw him thinking and confused. He informed him of his case. He said to him: Tell your adversary: The money is with me, so bring your friend to me so I can give the deposit to both of you. If he brings him, you have caught your adversary. That was the cause of the bathhouse keeper's salvation from that predicament. At that point, Abu Hanifa began recording Fiqh, and the mentioned issue was the first thing he established. Similarly, Principles of Jurisprudence (Usul al-Fiqh) was undertaken by the Mujtahid knowledgeable in the sciences needed to deduce the ruling from the verse and Hadith, having the power to look into the clear and ambiguous, the abrogating and abrogated, the literal and metaphorical, the soundness of Hadith from its weakness, the trustworthiness of narrators, and preferring one of two Hadiths over the other if they are equal in soundness according to what agrees with the rules and relies on legal analogy. The likes of this require abundant sciences. So Al-Shafi'i, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, came and established Principles of Jurisprudence, gathering what was scattered in sciences: from language in knowing the homonym, the contrast, the synonym, the literal, the metaphorical, the metaphor, and the metonymy. And from grammar in knowing condition and penalty, connected and disconnected exception, ordered conjunction and unordered conjunction, immediate and delayed, prepositions and their differing meanings, and ambiguous nouns, and so on. And from logic in knowing the indication of conformity, inclusion, and implication, knowing genus and species, difference and property, general accident, premises and conclusion, productive syllogism, and other things the jurist needs from the rules of debate and knowing fallacies. And what is needed of knowing the soundness, weakness, and goodness of Hadith, and so on. Al-Shafi'i, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, made it a science standing on its own head, even if its parts were scattered in sciences. Then people came after him and added to it what was possible. Likewise, the science of Ma'ani and Bayan was extracted from grammar, recorded, and made into an art standing on its own head. Regarding emphasizing two pronouns. He said: Let us present a statement that encompasses it and gathers its ends. We say: If the intended meaning is known and established in souls, you have the choice in emphasizing one of the pronouns with the other. If it is unknown and is something doubted, the priority then is to emphasize one of the pronouns with the other in indication to establish and confirm it. Among what came of that is His Almighty's saying: 'They said, O Moses, either you throw or we will be the throwers (Nahnu al-Mulqin).' For the magicians' will to throw before Moses was not known to him, and because they did not declare what was in their souls; and he spoke at length on that. I say: The benefit of what I determined has appeared, that Ma'ani and Bayan are part of grammar, and if they depart from grammatical rules, their speaker stumbles blindly. The proof of that is that he decided in the rule he has that if the meaning is established in the soul, you are free to emphasize one pronoun with the other. This rule is not absolute. For emphasis is repetition, and a condition of it, i.e., repetition, is that the meaning is complete without it, like: 'I hit Zayd Zayd,' 'Zayd Zayd came to me,' 'You You are the virtuous,' and 'He He is the generous.' All these forms permit deleting the emphasis because the meaning is complete without it. We have found the pronoun repeated where deleting it is not permissible, like His Almighty's saying: 'And We said, O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise.' And His Almighty's saying: 'Go, you and your Lord, and fight.' Because imperative verbs like: Stand, Sit, Dwell, all carry the pronoun and it is not permissible to show it, because the estimation is: Stand you, and Dwell you. For this reason, grammarians judged imperative verbs to be sentences (Kalam) because they are composed of a verb and a subject.",

    "text": "Do you not see that they raised an objection to Sheikh Jamal al-Din ibn al-Hajib, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, in his saying: 'The word (Kalimah) is an utterance coined for a singular meaning,' regarding pronouns hidden in imperative verbs collectively, and said: They are words but the tongue did not utter them. Even Sheikh Badr al-Din Muhammad ibn Malik, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, said: 'The word is an utterance potentially or actually.' So he guarded with his saying 'potentially' against the likes of pronouns carried by imperative verbs. For this reason, some interpreted 'utterance' saying: 'Utterance is what the tongue casts or what is in its ruling' so that Ibn al-Hajib's definition remains pure. If this is established, I say: 'Anta' (You) in His Almighty's saying: 'Uskun Anta' (Dwell You) is another prominent pronoun different from the pronoun hidden in 'Uskun', and its estimation is: 'Uskun Anta Anta wa Zawjuk' (Dwell You You and your wife). Yet, it is not permissible to delete the apparent pronoun here because it is not permissible to conjoin 'your wife' to the hidden pronoun, due to the weakness of what is potential compared to what is actual. This is contrary to His Almighty's saying: 'Or that we be the throwers (Nahnu al-Mulqin).' So it is proven that the expert of Ma'ani, if he does not know grammar, does not know what he says. It is possible to answer for him and excuse him by saying: He is speaking about emphasis (Tawkid), and His Almighty's saying: 'Dwell, you and your wife' is not a case of emphasis, but was brought for another matter, which is the impermissibility of conjoining to the hidden pronoun, and this is other than emphasis. I said: In any case, it is a flawed, insufficient expression, needing a constraint to exclude the likes of this, otherwise it contradicts the rule he established, for rules need to be tight and unambiguous. Ibn al-Athir discusses Al-Mutanabbi regarding some of his poetry. He said in the eighth type regarding using the general in negation and the special in affirmation: Many poets have neglected that, among them Abu al-Tayyib where he says: 'O Badr (Moon), O Bahr (Sea), O Ghamamah (Cloud), O... Layth al-Shara (Lion), O Hamam (Death/Rain), O Rajul (Man).' If he does that, he is like one rising from a place to a higher place, and if he opposes it, he is like one descending from a place to a lower place. As for his saying: 'O Badr,' it is the name of the praised one and starting with it is priority. Then he should say after it: 'O Man, O Lion, O Cloud, O Sea, O Hamam,' because the Lion is greater than the Man, the Cloud is greater than the Lion, the Sea is greater than the Cloud, and the Hamam is greater than the Sea. I say: Ibn Abi al-Hadid discussed this and said words whose summary I mention. It is that Al-Mutanabbi intended a valid purpose because he started with the Sea, which is lower than the Cloud, because the sea here is the one that is visited (for water), and it is like the pond and the river, not the salty sea, for that is a complete exhaustion. Rivers and ponds branch from the Cloud. Then he moved and said: 'O Lion of al-Shara' and moved from it to 'Hamam' because it is higher than the Lion, for were it not for death (Hamam), the Lion would not be feared. To mention generosity first, he said 'O Sea', and to mention bravery second, he said 'O Lion', and he prioritized generosity because the need of the majority of people for generosity is greater than their need for bravery. End. This is the summary of Ibn Abi al-Hadid's speech, and by my life, it is a good interpretation, reversing Ibn al-Athir's intent against him and making the verse a case of moving from lower to higher. Most people criticized the verse as Ibn al-Athir did. I said: People have another interpretation for it, which is that he is not required to move from lower to higher in what he intended. He wanted to describe him with the praise he claimed in him before. He said: 'O Badr' is his name. Then he said 'O Sea', and if I am not truthful in what I say, then 'O Cloud', and if I am not truthful, then 'O Lion', and if I am not truthful, then 'O Hamam' because you deprive the souls of your enemies of life. And if I am not truthful, then 'O Man' who gathered these qualities I mentioned. Although this interpretation is not as strong or beautiful as what Ibn Abi al-Hadid mentioned. Ibn al-Athir claimed that Hamam is bigger and higher than the Sea and did not explain the reason for that. What I say regarding that is: Because death is an expression of the absence of life, and the sea is an expression of the existence of abundant, overwhelming water, and absence is more general than existence, so it is higher than it in this regard and prioritized over it. Of this is His Almighty's saying: 'Praise be to Allah who created the heavens and the earth, and made darkness and light.' It is said: He prioritized darkness over light because darkness is an expression of the absence of light, and absence precedes existence. Were it not for this interpretation in this noble verse, Al-Mutanabbi's saying: 'O Badr, O Sea...' the verse, would be of this category.",

    "text": "It is problematic for the one who decided that one only moves from the lower to the higher. With this rule they decided, those who favored Angels over Prophets held fast and said: Allah Almighty moved from the lower to the higher in His Almighty's saying: 'Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor would the angels near [to Him].' For the Wise does not move from the higher to the lower, and the eloquent does not say: 'I do not think of the Sultan nor the Vizier,' but says: 'I do not think of the Vizier nor the Sultan.' The correct view held by the scholars of the Sunnah is that Prophets are better than Angels, except those who deviated among them like: Judge Abu Bakr al-Baqillani and Abu Abdullah al-Halimi. His saying: 'And the example of its efforts in the eyes of enemies was a wondrous thing.' This is empty speech like a body without a spirit. And his saying: 'And showed them in wakefulness terror and fear, and in sleep difficult camels, leading noble horses.' The origin of this meaning belongs to Ashja' al-Sulami: 'And upon your enemy, O cousin of Muhammad... are two watchers: the light of dawn and darkness / If he wakes, you terrify him, and if he sleeps... dreams draw your swords against him.' Nothing adorned his second rhyme except his inclusion of the rhyme that came in the vision of the Mobedan on the night the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was born, and what came regarding that from the speech of Satih. Ibn al-Athir celebrated these two rhymes and wanted to match Al-Qadi Al-Fadil in the prayer of the letter he wrote regarding the conquest of Jerusalem. From it: 'And may the rains of his favor not cease to be Anwa' (heavy rains) to the spring quarters and Anwar (lights) to the mosques, and the expeditions of his terror to the enemies be horses (Khayl) to the watchtowers and phantoms (Khayal) to the sleeping places.' You, O standing upon these papers, are a judge between these two adversaries, and in your hand is the command to distinguish between the two speeches: 'So whoever deserves elevation, elevate him... and whoever deserves lowering, lower him into his privy.' Even if my passion inclined me to the speech of Al-Fadil. To Allah belongs Ibn Sana' al-Mulk where he said: 'I saw the full moon then I saw her... What is upon me if I loved the better one?' Then he said: 'And it is the conquest of Jerusalem for which the doors of heaven opened, and the stars of darkness increased with the tales of its glory, and the right of Islam was reclaimed, and long have aspirations striven in seeking it with provision and water.' What aspirations are these, and what can they attain if they have nothing but provision and water? Did they not have a concern other than provision and water, nor a thought other than that? An aspiration whose concern is not horses, men, weapons, perseverance, night travel, riding dangers, crossing deserts, and patience over sleeplessness and types of hardships—what thing can it attain? Then he said: 'And among the best he brought is that he comforted his second Qibla with his first Qibla.' I say: The rare beauty in this is what appeared in the sermon of Judge Muhyi al-Din ibn al-Zaki, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, while on the pulpit in the first Friday held in Jerusalem: 'And this mosque of yours is the first of the two Qiblas, the second of the two Harams, and the third of the two Mosques...' Al-Imad al-Katib also used that in a letter he wrote to the Divan of the Caliphate regarding the conquest of Jerusalem as well, saying after mentioning the Rock: 'So hands shook from it the place of the foot, and the joy and message were renewed for it as they were in ancient times (Qidam); for it is the second of the two Mosques, rather the third of the two Harams.' Then he said: 'And it had emerged from the weapons in a magnificent dress of impregnability, and brought out from the great darkness (Sawad A'zam) what deceived eyes, and war is deception.' I say: Is this written about a king who suffered horrors as he suffered, endured what he endured, and sacrificed himself, his son, his family, his wealth, and his armies until he saved the likes of Jerusalem from the likes of the Franks? He wants to relate to the Caliph with this favor, magnify the matter, and describe the hardships he endured until this great conquest happened in the days of the Caliph, was added to his kingdom, and entered his grasp. It is said: He deceived them with the great darkness (Sawad A'zam - also means great multitude) and war is deception. This is not appropriate in this context. Then he said: 'And the necks of lands are not defended by the abundance of the blackness (Sawad), nor protected by high walls, but by high spears.' I say: It would have been better if he had said: 'And the necks of lands are not defended by the abundance of the blackness (multitude), but by the whiteness of opinion and abundance of correctness.'",

    "text": "However, this letter which Ibn al-Athir—may Allah have mercy on him—cited to oppose [Al-Qadi] Al-Fadil is among the best he created and the finest he embellished. The reason for this is that he opposed him directly, borrowing his merits of deliberation and patience; thus, it came out refined with its flowers blooming. Had he taken a separate path, and Al-Qadi Al-Fadil taken another, and they sat in one place working without a template, the front-runner in the race would have been clearly distinguished from the straggler. This is similar to when Sultan Al-Mu'izz suggested to Ibn Rashiq and Ibn Sharaf Al-Qayrawani that they compose poetry regarding the slender legs of a woman, praising them because he admired them while some rival wives criticized them. He said: 'I want this to be an argument for her against those who find fault with her.' So, each of them went aside and composed on the spot. Ibn Sharaf came up with: 'And a Bilqis-like woman adorned with hair... sparse like what a miser gives. It resembled the down on cheeks, and every cheek... that has down is beloved and beautiful. If the palace of Bilqis was glass... then from the pupils of eyes she has palaces.' Ibn Rashiq came up with: 'They criticize a Bilqis-like woman when they see upon her... what was seen by the one who erected the palace. The downy hair only increased her beauty, just as... the down on the cheeks of beardless youths increases their beauty.' Al-Mu'izz admired Ibn Sharaf's verses and criticized Ibn Rashiq's, saying: 'You have provided her opponent with an argument by saying \"They criticize,\" for indeed some people did criticize it.' This is sound criticism. Look at how these two poets spoke with one tongue, from one vision, one meaning, and one rhyme. There is no harm in establishing part of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil's letter regarding the mentioned Conquest [of Jerusalem]. Were it not for the fear of elongation, I would have included both letters in their entirety, but they can be taken from their respective sources. Al-Qadi Al-Fadil—may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him—said: 'May Allah perpetuate the days of the Noble Diwan, and may it remain victorious over every denier, rich through success beyond the opinion of any scout, its endeavors dedicated to acquiring the absolutes of praise, its victory awake while the sword sleeps in its scabbard, arriving at the clouds of generosity while clouds do not arrive at the earth, its endeavors of merit numerous even if met with only a single thanks, the judgment of its justice executed with a determination that does not proceed to draw a sword of error or feather an arrow of guidance. May the rains of its virtue continue towards the allies as stars to the meadows and lights to the mosques, and the expeditions of its terror towards the enemies as horses to the watchtowers and phantoms to the sleeping quarters.' From it: 'To Allah belongs the satisfaction in the repetition of His thanks, and for the present blessing is a permanence of which it cannot be said \"this has passed.\" The affairs of Islam have turned to their best destinies, the beliefs of its people have settled upon their insights, and the extended shadow of the disbeliever has retracted. Allah has been truthful to the people of His religion; when the condition was fulfilled, the conditioned result occurred. Islam was a stranger, and now it is in its homeland; victory was offered, and souls were spent as its price. The command of Allah came while the noses of polytheism were rubbed in dust, and the swords journeyed by night while lifetimes were asleep. Allah fulfilled His promise to make His religion prevail over all religion, and lights flew for it revealing that the morning, in comparison, has a cowardly brow. The Muslims reclaimed an inheritance that had absconded from them; they seized it while awake, something they did not believe they would seize even as a phantom visiting in sleep from a distance. Their feet settled on the highest ground, their flags fluttered over the farthest reach, and their lips met upon the Rock (Al-Sakhrah); and though it was a rock, their thirst was quenched by it as one is quenched by water. When the Religion arrived upon it, it recognized in it the core of its heart, and its peer, the Black Stone, congratulated it on the consummation of its protection from the disbeliever and his war. Praise be to Allah that it entered the sanctuary by removing that sewn structure, and it was purified by what dripped from the support of disbelief—and the surrounding ocean would not have been enough to purify it. The servant [Saladin] did not strive his striving except for this great boon, nor did he endure that misery except for this blessing, nor did he fight those he deemed oppressors except so the Word would be united and the Word of Allah would be the highest, and to win the jewels of the Hereafter, not the base goods of this world. He who seeks something grave risks himself; he who desires a profitable deal [with God] is a winner; and he who aspires to clear the flood plunges in.' From it, when mentioning the Caliphs: 'No doubt they inherited their secret and their inner self to their purest successor, their greatest son, their noble remnant, their lofty vanguard, and the title of the page of their virtue; may Islam never lack the black of the pen and the white of the page.' From it: 'The East is guided by its lights; nay, if a light appeared from its essence, the West would call out to hide it, for it is a light not concealed by the darkness of dusk, and a mention not hidden by the leaves of scriptures.' From it, mentioning disbelief: 'A sword whose eyelid slept, yet its wakefulness spilled the drops of slumber from eyelids; the noses of its spears were cut off, though they had long been haughty with desires and bleeding with death. The Holy Pure Land became [clean], though it had been menstruating, and the Lord is Single and One, though in their claim He was the third [of three].'",

    "text": "From it: 'Allah replaced the bad deed with the good deed, and transferred the house of His worship from the hands of the companions of the left hand to the companions of the right hand.' From it: 'How many crescents of swords were engaged in exchange of blows until they returned like old date stalks, and how many stars of spears exchanged piercing until they became like the plague-stricken. The day was witnessed, the angels were witnesses, the Cross was screaming, Islam was newborn, and the ribs of the disbelievers were fuel for the fire of Hell.' From it, mentioning the Count and his flight: 'He was capable on the day of victory in fighting, and on the day of defeat in trickery. So he escaped, but how? He flew out of fear that the beak of the spear and the wing of the sword would catch him. It was likewise for their equipment, and he transferred from the Angel of Death to Malik [Keeper of Hell]. After the defeat, the Servant passed over the lands and folded them by spreading over them the Abbasid banner—black in dye, white in deed—fluttering, along with the hearts of its enemies and the determinations of its allies, illuminated by its lights when humans open their eyes to it, while the fingers of its streamers pointed toward the face of victory.' From it: 'He reaps disbelief and plants faith; he brings down crosses from their mosques and raises calls to prayer (Adhan); he changes altars into pulpits and churches into mosques; he settles the people of the Quran in the seats of fighting after the people of the Cross; and it delights his eye and the eye of the people of Islam that victory was attached to him and his army like a neighbor and what is neighboring (Preposition and object), and that he triumphs over every wall whose shaking and removal was not feared until the day of blowing into the Horn.' From it: 'He faced it then fought it; he descended to it then combated it; he emerged against it then dueled it; he restrained it then finished it. He embraced it with an embrace after which he anticipated the opening (conquest), and he cracked its gathering so that they could not endure the servitude of the sword edge after the freedom of pardon.' From it: 'He brought forward the mangonels whose beams and ropes undertake the punishments of fortresses, and he strung for them bows that strike while their arrows do not leave their blades. They shook hands with the wall, so their arrow became a toothpick in the gaps of its battlements. Victory presented a vulture from the mangonel that clings to the earth yet rises high to the sky (Arcturus); it fractured the cartilage of its towers and made the sound of its dust heard, emptying the wall of patrols and the war of spectators. It enabled the miner to unveil the face of war and return the stone to its original state of dust. He advanced to the rock, chewing its mail with the fangs of his pickaxe, untying its knots with his clumsy blow that indicated the delicacy of his fingertips. He made the Noble Rock hear his yearning and plea until it almost softened at his fatal spot. Some stones disowned others, and ruin took a covenant upon it that it would not leave the ground. He opened a door in the wall that blocked doors of escape for them. He began to crumble its stone, and the disbeliever said: \"Oh, I wish I were dust.\"' From it, regarding receiving the city: 'Islam possessed a plan with which its covenant was a dwelling of inhabitants, then disbelief served it until it became a garden of paradise. No doubt Allah the Exalted expelled them from it and brought them down, pleasing the people of Truth and angering them.' From it: 'In it is every strange type of marble whose water flows but its shimmer does not flow away. Iron was made delicate in its marbling, and art was mastered in its expansion, until the iron, which has severe might, became like gold, which has ready comfort. You see nothing but seats like meadows with shimmering white marble, and columns like trees with leafy vegetation.' From it: 'The sermon (Khutbah) was established, and the heavens almost split apart from flowing tears, not from silence, and the stars almost scattered from joy, not for stoning devils. The word of Monotheism (Tawhid) was raised to Allah while its path had been blocked; the graves of the Prophets were purified while they had been defiled by impurities; the five [prayers] were established while the Trinity had been holding them back; tongues voiced \"Allah is Great\" while the magic of disbelief had been knotting them; and the name of the Commander of the Faithful was announced in his most noble location from the pulpit, so he was welcomed with the welcome of one who is righteous by one who is righteous. His two banners fluttered in the east and west; had he flown from joy, he would have flown with his two wings.' From it: 'Every hardship compared to the Conquest is bearable, and the ambitions of the Franks after this are neither hopeful nor isolated. If they make a call, the Servant hopes from Allah it will not be heard, and they will not untie their hands from the collars of the lands until they are cut off. For these good tidings, there are news that cannot be personified except by tongues, nor summarized by anything other than oral communication. Therefore, he sent So-and-so explaining, and a loud announcer giving good news, presenting the report in its context, and displaying the army of joy from its vanguard to its rearguard. He is So-and-so.' He said in another letter mentioning the Rock: 'Nebuchadnezzar's luck in returning Jerusalem was sharper than the sword of Nebuchadnezzar.' Here I mention the verses of the companion Jamal al-Din ibn Matruh, may Allah have mercy on him, which are: 'The Al-Aqsa Mosque has a habit... that traveled and became a proverb current (Mathal Sa'ir) / If it becomes a settlement for disbelief... Allah sends a helper (Nasir) for it / So a Nasir [Saladin] purified it first... and a Nasir [Al-Nasir Dawud] purified it last.' Returning to the words of Al-Fadil:",

    "text": "From it: 'Disbelief had settled in this city, so it possessed and consumed it, locked it and secured it. Its keys were lost to Islam and it did not find them except in the time of the Commander of the Faithful, and they are the swords. No battle line was struck in its courtyard for war until rows were struck in its mosque for prayer. So he reclaimed the Rock, which is the bezel of the ring of Islam, just as Solomon of old reclaimed his ring; and the agent of Islam in reclaiming its ring was its sharp sword.' End of the speech of Al-Fadil, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him. This is intuitive, not like the drafting of a sayer... who, when he intends to speak, falsifies it for a month. Ibn al-Athir—may Allah have mercy on him—followed the book of the conquest of Jerusalem with a chaotic appointment decree (for market inspection - Hisba), in which he elongated without a mediator in its knot, nor a witticism in its folds to link it with wonder. Rather, he exhausted the etiquettes of Hisba and enumerated them, set its commandments in his wire and arranged them, and lengthened its text when he listed them. He displayed knowledge in it, not the subtlety of work, and produced it stripped of beauties, so there is no desire in it for the skilled composer nor hope. It is more worthy of being a chapter on the etiquettes of Hisba than being counted among appointment decrees, and to be added to books written for that purpose rather than being listed in the collection of composition (Insha'). ? Regarding the occurrence of 'an' after 'lamma' and its effect on indicating a delay in time. He said in the seventeenth type regarding Repetition: He mentioned the entry of 'an' which comes after 'lamma' and claimed that if it enters the speech, it indicates that the action was not immediate, and that there was a delay and a respite. He cited the Almighty's saying: 'And when (falamma an) the bearer of good tidings came, he cast it over his face, and he returned seeing.' He argued: If one looks at the story of Joseph with his brothers from the time they threw him in the well until the bearer of good tidings came to his father, peace be upon him, one finds that there was a delay and a very long duration. Had there not been a long period and an extended term, 'an' would not have been brought after 'lamma' and before the verb. Rather, the verse would have been: 'falamma ja'a...' (So when the bearer of good tidings came...). He said: These are subtleties and symbols not found with the grammarians because it is not their concern. I say: This is a crime of a man's vanity with his own mind and opinion. Do you not see how he imagined error to be correctness, then began to boast that he found what the grammarians did not understand nor know? Did he not look at this 'Fa' (So/Then) which indicates succession; following what did it appear? Did it appear following the Almighty's saying: 'So when they took him and agreed to put him in the bottom of the well...' and the verses related to the incident of throwing him in the well, for him to make this claim? Or did it appear following the Almighty's saying: 'Go with this shirt of mine and cast it over my father's face; he will become seeing. And bring me your family, all together. And when the caravan departed, their father said: \"Indeed, I find the scent of Joseph, if you did not think me senile.\" They said: \"By Allah, indeed you are in your old error.\"... up to the Almighty's saying: 'And when (falamma an) the bearer of good tidings came...'? So what delay is there between these two events of 'far distance' and 'extended duration'? It was only the measure of the distance from Egypt to the land of Canaan, the residence of Jacob, peace be upon him, which is about twelve days or thereabouts. That is why the grammarians said: It ('an') is extra here. He also said in this type, citing the verse of Abu Nuwas: 'We stayed in it a day, and a day, and a third... and a day to which the day of departure was a fifth.' His meaning by that is that they stayed four days. Oh, wonder at him! He brings such a silly verse indicating obscene inarticulateness amidst those verses. I say: The matter is not as he claimed, that he meant they stayed four days. Rather, some literati have held that the stay was seven days, based on the evidence that he stayed 'a day, and a day, and a third'—these are three days. Then he said: 'and a day to which the day of departure was a fifth,' so he added the three to another four, the fifth of which was the day of departure. The person of taste does not doubt that this expression is better than saying: 'We stayed in it a week,' even if the latter is more concise in wording, but that has its place. Even if we concede that the stay was four days, he repeated it for a meaning found only in this repetition, which is that the stay in this state is a station of describing days he spent in pleasure. So he began counting them individually, not in sum, saying: 'We stayed in it a day, and a day, and a day,' like one savoring the form of each day he summons in his mind, and the types of pleasures and delights that passed for them in it. This is a common matter in good and evil, so it is said: 'He contacted me day, after day, after day, after day,' and 'He abandoned me day, after day, after day, after day.' Similar to this is the saying of Marwan al-Asghar: 'May Allah water Najd, and peace be upon Najd... and oh, how lovely is Najd despite the distance and remoteness.' He repeated it to savor its mention and burn with longing for it. And how excellent is Al-Mutanabbi where he said:",

    "text": "'So I swear, if you saw me at her death... and my eyelid pouring tears bucket after bucket / You would have mourned for a blade whose sheath death took... and marveled at a branch wailing over a root.' This metonymy might be beautiful from Al-Sharif Al-Radi in the chapter of sarcasm (Tahakkum) and be the ultimate in beauty. In general, the ugliness of the metonymy he mentioned is not intrinsic but due to an accidental matter. Although he cited after it the saying of Al-Farazdaq mourning his wife: 'And a sheath of blades I have been bereaved of, so I did not wail... over it, nor did I send wailing women over it.' He said: This is beautiful and novel in its chapter, and no woman who died was alluded to with a plural better than this metonymy nor more magnificent in status. It is said to him: What beauty is in this and what ugliness in that? Regarding conceptual fallacies. He said in the twentieth type regarding conceptual fallacies: Among it is what I wrote in a section of a letter upon my entry into the lands of the Romans (Anatolia), describing the cold and snow: 'Among the qualities of this cold is that it knots pearls in its background, and tears in its tip. Perhaps it transgressed to the well of the mind, so it deserved that I run with its description. The earth is gray (Shahba'), except that it is a yearling not trained. The flood channels of mountains are rivers, except that they are frozen not waded.' I say: Then he began to describe the place of beauty in his saying: 'Yearling and not trained.' What great beauty is in this to record and cite? But he is excused if a Tawriya (double entendre) occurred in his speech to propose to it. How would he be if he said like Al-Qadi Al-Fadil describing the cold: 'In a night whose wine froze, and whose ember was extinguished... to a day when the onion would wish to increase its layers (shirts), and the sun would wish to drag the fire to its disk.' Al-Jalal ibn al-Saffar versified this, saying: 'And a day of cold whose breaths... tear faces with their pinching / A day whose sun wishes from its cold... that it could drag the fire to its disk.' And from the speech of Al-Fadil in a very cold night: 'In a night water froze in its felts until its back became heavy, and the rule in simile was reversed until its wool became like mountains.' Sahib Jamal al-Din ibn Matruh said: 'Look, you will find the face of the earth white... no black mole appearing in it / The clouds were generous and covered the soil with snow... Indeed, the generous one has the white hand.' Mujir al-Din Muhammad ibn Tamim said: 'Since your world promised that you would remain... in bliss and happiness that does not end / The proof of its fulfillment was that it... began facing us with a white face.' Mujir al-Din also said regarding the cold: 'And a cold night in which blew... a breeze not faced by chests / A breeze from which the garden shivers... when it arrives, and the pond trembles.' Then he said: 'Among that is what I mentioned in describing a generous man, so I said: And I descended upon him with Muhallabi (Generous) deeds, Ahnafi (Forbearing) morals, and I met him as if I was not frightened by the sting of separation. No dignity for family and homeland so that I say I exchanged family and homeland for him. My covenant with days is that they are weaning (Fatima) from charity, but he generated beauty (Hasan) by his neighborhood.' Then he began praising that. I say: The utmost of what he mentioned is that he used the name of Fatima and Al-Hasan, may Allah be pleased with them both, as a Tawriya, and this is not great. How beautiful is what Al-Qadi Al-Fadil used of the name of Al-Hasan, saying addressing noble people (Ashraf): 'The happy one is he whose new resembles his old, the happy one. Old honor is cut off if new honor does not connect it. The branch from the deep-rooted tree, if it does not grow, is firewood. Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, his uncle was Abu Lahab. It is ugly that your deed be ugly while your grandfather is Al-Hasan. And that your beginning be a fighter so there is no fitnah, and you fight so there are fitnahs.' How beautiful is the saying of Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar praising Saif al-Din Ali ibn Qilij in part of a poem mentioning time: 'And I am accustomed to bearing its calamities... if its bearer becomes tired or weary of worry / I say to my poverty: Welcome, for my certainty... that Ali is killing it with nobilities.' Such is Tawriya, and such is the transformation of imagination. Among what I happened to organize: 'I say to a singer who sang to us... while tears had ulcerated the lids of my eyes / O beautiful of face (Hasan), return and take... with the voice of Ali for us in Husayni (maqam).' Then he said: 'From this style is what I wrote in a section of a letter to some friends, saying: His covenant is with my pen while it adorns itself with clarity by his names, and highlights the lights of meanings from his darknesses. My hand has become from it a carrier of firewood (Hammalat al-Hatab), and my mind has become Abu Jahl after it was Abu Lahab.'",

    "text": "I say: Al-Qadi Al-Fadil used the likes of this often, and later writers became fond of such things, bringing in it the sea and the ocean. Ibn al-Nabih said: 'If the daughter of the bunch (wine) were not his saliva... his red cheek would not have become Abu Lahab / May the hands of my blamer regarding him perish (Tabbat), and his cheek... is a carrier of roses, not a carrier of firewood.' Ibn Sana' al-Mulk said about a person with facial hair: 'You were like a gazelle possessing softness... You became like a bull possessing a dewlap / A cheek that was Abu Lahab... returned as a carrier of firewood.' He said: 'I described you while the blamer opposed with blame... So you were Abu Dharr and he was Abu Jahl.' I said while I was in the sands of Egypt at Al-Arish: 'We came to the trellis (Arish) of sand at the time of its heat... So we said to it: May your hands perish, O Abu Lahab / And how many a tamarisk tree with no shade or fruit... Met us from it with the carrier of firewood.' Then he said in a section: 'Among the traces of his endeavors is that he possessed the lock of nobilities and their key. If asked for a virtue, he was its granter (Manna'), and if asked for a gift, he was its donor (Manah). A better trace than that is that he took the reins of correctness and softened their unruliness. If he witnessed the thick of war, he was its Victor (Mansur), and if he met the soul of a crisis, he was its Shedder (Saffah).' I say: This chapter, I mean the names of Caliphs in titles, is something people dared to enter, and every literati crossed it and acted in its outcome. It is easy to lead in Tawriya if pulled, and quick to rise if established or set up. Ibn Sana' al-Mulk said: 'The hand of happiness pledged allegiance to him, and the pledge... was repeated upon him by the Right Hand (Al-Yamin) / The Right Opinion (Al-Rashid) chose him over the world... So he is the Trustworthy (Al-Amin) and the Trusted (Al-Ma'mun).' Saif al-Din al-Mashadd ibn Qizil said: 'O people of my affection, a call from a sick one... whose complaint was hidden from visitors / By Allah, my skin is not obedient to you... No, nor by Allah is my heart the Guide (Al-Hadi).' Ibn Sana' al-Mulk said: 'By my father and mother is the one who is Sufficient (Al-Muktafi)... with his beauty, to his beauty as the Follower (Al-Muqtadi) / Lonely, unique in his beauty... Do not wonder at the loneliness of the Unique (Al-Mutafarrid).' Mujir al-Din Muhammad ibn Tamim said: 'O you who prefer my heading to Hama and my service... Its Sultan is after every Prince / I am confident in the Right (Rashid) of your opinion, obedient... to its Trustworthy (Amin), the Guide (Hadi) to the Victor (Mansur).' Then he said in a section: 'I only say that he felt (Sha'ara - pun on poetry) that stolen joy, so he established the Cutting (Qat' - poetic/prosody term) upon it, and saw life in it as Lowering (Khafd - ease/grammar term) so he removed it with Raising (Raf' - grammar term).' I say: This chapter is also among what preceded, and its wall is among what was ruined and demolished. People entered it in crowds, and their pearls in it pleased singly and in pairs. Al-Siraj al-Warraq said mourning Al-Jazzar: 'They raised (Raf') you and stood standing, lowering (Khafid) the... voices when death truncated (Jazm) the bonds from you / You became in the shrouds concealed (Mudmar) from them... while they see you as a manifestation (Mazhar) for majesty / Indeed the Sound (Sahih) became ill since you left us... By your father, the Sound Plural (Jam' Sahih) broke (Takassar).' He also said: 'Your enviers set up (Nasb) enmity, so they ended up... with Truncation (Jazm) for their tongues and Lowering (Khafd) of status / So when will I see them turned back while their heads... are Raised (Marfu'a) by the agents of spears.' Shihab al-Din al-Talla'fari said: 'And when the hill overlooked and I smelled from... the breath of the sanctuary a fragrance like the spread of perfume / Ask its Erected (Mansub) hill where is its Raised (Marfu') talk... from the tail of the east wind which is Dragged (Majrur).' This is the utmost beauty of craftsmanship, for he brought the Accusative in the Accusative, the Nominative in the Nominative, and the Genitive in the Genitive. He has two other verses in this meaning, but these are better and more complete. In general, these things, the later writers violated their sanctity and prevented the fathers from their protection, especially the names of Caliphs as preceded, titles of grammar as preceded, and names of Quranic Surahs. As Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar said praising Fakhr al-Qudah Nasrallah ibn Basaqa: 'How many a night I spent in difficulty while I had... in the adornment of my hopes treasures of ease / I say to my poverty whenever I longed for wealth... When the Help of Allah (Nasrallah) comes, may the hand of poverty perish (Tabbat).' And as he also said when a robe was bestowed upon a black poet and not upon him, addressing Jamal al-Din ibn Ramadan: 'It is not hidden from you what the black one attained... yesterday of the Sultan's generosity and his walking / With the turban, the robe... the sleeve handkerchief, and the shawl.'",

    "text": "'I said when I detailed against him, I see the Ornament (Zukhruf)... recited by text above the Smoke (Dukhan).' And as Saif al-Din ibn Qizil said: 'I swear by my eyelid by the Scatterers (Dhariyat)... And by the tears of the eye by the Emissaries (Mursalat) / I am upon sincerity in your love... Until you see my soul in the Pluckers (Nazi'at).' And as another said: 'I implore the Merciful (Rahman) to gather our union... He swears this will not be until the Gathering (Hashr) / If his heart became like Iron (Hadid)... Then by the Time (Asr), the lovers are indeed in Loss (Khusr).' And names of books, as one said in verses: 'O you who ask me after them about my state... Leaving the answer is the Answer to this Question / My state if narrated is neither Summarized (Jumal) nor... Shining (Luma'), having no Completion (Takmila) / I have a burning passion that leaves the Eloquent (Fasih) stupid... So leave the Detailed (Mufassal) and take the Summary (Mujmal) / The heart is not of the Healthy (Sahih) so its Reform (Islah) is hoped... And the eye is heavy clouds.' He mentioned in these three verses ten names of literary works. As Ibn Qizil said regarding a beautiful person playing the Qanun: 'You see Ibn Sina in his hands... The least of his playing is Singing (Ghina) / His Canon (Qanun) is Pleasing (Murtada), Salvation (Najah)... All his Signals (Isharat) are Healing (Shifa).' He mentioned in the second verse, despite the shortness of its meter, four books of the Chief (Avicenna). And as Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar said: 'O my Master (Maliki), my Intercessor (Shafi'i) is nothing... to you but my manners / Far be it from you to need in alerting... the Polished (Muhadhdhab).' And names of Sheikhs of Sciences, as Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar said: 'Indeed, the season of winter, since it approached my body... my limbs showed its explanation / In it my bone is the Cooled (Mubarrad) as the Clothed (Kisa'i) appeared... and the Furrier (Farra') protected himself.' And as Nasir al-Din Hasan ibn al-Naqib said: 'O one whose Stations (Maqamat) in generosity are gilded... And of his honorific robes are embroidery and brocade / You gave me a body cast down having no... spirit, and having disturbance and agitation from the cold / There is no dispensing with a fur coat under the silk... Indeed, the Silk-maker (Hariri) is in need of the Furrier (Farra').' And as Mujir al-Din Muhammad ibn Tamim said: 'And a singing woman repeating her song to me... delighting me while I ignore what she says / With a melody in which Ibrahim was confused... And a meter which Al-Khalil did not know.' Sharaf al-Din al-Maqdisi, may Allah have mercy on him, organized a poem approaching fifty verses, collecting a group of books of Exegesis, Hadith, Fiqh, Grammar, Language, and others, and mentioning Sheikhs of Sciences and others. It is all ghazal. And the names of the twelve Zodiac signs and the Stations. As Ibn Qizil said: 'A full moon for whom I made the heart Tents (Akhbiyah)... So that its watcher the Howler (Awwa') does not see it / The Sun bestowed upon him the splendor of his beauty... And Gemini (Jawza') gave him the splendor of his mouth.' And as another said: 'I spent the night with the full moon of darkness as my bedfellow... And he was compliant without refusal / So I said to the enviers when... the Sun shone with rays / The Heart and the Glance (Tarf) are his two stations... And he is until now in the Arm (Dhra').' And as another said regarding a beautiful person ploughing: 'O Ploughman (Harith) from whom stations of passion are narrated... regarding his lethal glance, interpreted / He became splitting the graves of those killed by passion... In his ploughing, not neglected lines / My soul is the ransom for a full moon driving... the Bull, not desiring anything but the Ear of Corn (Sunbula).' And names of famous Arabs, as Ibn Sana' al-Mulk said: 'I, despite my preoccupation with passion... was not distracted, and my idleness was not nullified / I am the grandfather of the Prophet's Helpers (Ansar) because I am... O blue-eyed one, the servant of the Ashhal (Abd al-Ashhal).' And as Ibn Qizil said: 'I returned in him to the Jahili... love without transgression / The glance of my eye is Abd Shams... and my heart is Abd Wadd.' And as Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn al-Tilmisani said: 'I was not mad (Majnun) with passion before... a reasoning one (Aqil) was seen for my heart captive in your temples / And if Quss were a describer of a cheek of yours... a plant in it would disable him (Baqil - pun on Baqil the stupid).' And names of cities, names of sects and creeds, names of prosody meters, names of Quran reciters, names of geomancy figures, names of poets, names of Arab stations and places, and things other than that.",

    "text": "Were it not for fear of prolongation, and that I did not produce these papers for this purpose, I would have brought evidence for that. So that you may know, O you who stand upon this book of mine, that Ibn al-Athir, may Allah have mercy on him, did not bring much benefit, nor did the breaths of dawn or the coolness of afternoons become gentle by his speech. And that if his existence had been delayed to this age, he would have known that his saying is not a proof, and that his drop drowns in such an abyss, and that people have reached the destination while he is until now in the darkness of the night. How beautiful is the saying of Mujahid al-Khayyat satirizing Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar: 'Abu al-Husayn, be polite... Pride in poetry is no pride / While you have not been wet by it... with a drop, while it is a sea / Even if you brought a verse... and your verse has no value / You did not bring the verse except... that there is a monopoly on it for the people.' I have written a book on Tawriya and named it 'Fadd al-Khitam 'an al-Tawriya wa al-Istikhdam' (Breaking the Seal on Double Entendre and Usage). If you want to uncover the essence of that and stand upon its beauties, then examine it; perhaps there will be a cream in it for you, or you will find in it help for what you see. Then he said in a section mentioning fever (Humma): 'For this reason, medicines in its treatment became not medicines, and the days of its slaughter (Nahr) among people became not beginning with days of perfusion (Tarwiyah - day before Arafa).' I say: In the first rhyme, there is no benefit and it is empty speech. As for the second, there is nothing in it except the Tawriya of the Day of Tarwiyah for Nahr, and there is no great matter in that. How beautiful is the saying of Al-Jazzar: 'I am of a people for whom shedding blood... is a habit, and ask about them if you desire my verification / Their courtyards shine with blood in brightness... So all their days are Days of Tashriq.' As for the verses of Al-Mutanabbi regarding fever, no one has the like of them in beauty. Among them: 'And my visitor, as if she has shyness... So she does not visit except in sleep / I offered her robes and mattresses... But she refused them and spent the night in my bones / The skin narrows for my soul and for her... So she expands it with types of sickness / When she leaves me, she washes me... As if we were secluded for a forbidden act / As if the morning drives her away, so her tears flow... in four pouring channels.' Al-Siraj al-Warraq followed his path and said: 'And my visitor, and she has no modesty... She visits in the forenoon and knocks in sleep / She has whoredom and has no abstinence... From the old sheikh nor the boy / When she knocks, I seek refuge in Allah from her... I was consoled from noble women and men / She has heat in my exterior and cold... In my heart, and languor in the bones / Her fire cooks my flesh as food... And she drinks pure wine from my blood / And the sounds of singing for her are my moaning... So she does not cease from this station (Maqam) / She lies with me despite my weakness and gray hair... While mistresses of tents tired me / When she leaves me, she washes me... Because I have reached my death (Hamam).' How beautiful is the saying of Amhadust al-Daylami: 'And a visitor visiting without a watcher... And descending upon the youth without his love / She spends the night inside his entrails... So he seeks afterwards from the greatness of his distress / And prevents him from the delicious life until... She disturbs him in his food and drink / She came to visit me without a promise... And how many a visitor is not welcome.' And the saying of Nasir al-Din Hasan ibn al-Naqib: 'I say to the turn of fever: Leave me... And let there not be a return for you as long as I live / She said: How is it possible to leave this... And does the Prince remain without a turn (music band/turn)?' Mujir al-Din Muhammad ibn Tamim was witty in his saying, when Al-Nur al-Is'irdi had a fever: 'They hid their schadenfreude from me and approached... in the guise of one with a wounded, injured heart / They said that the Light (Al-Nur) has a fever (Humma). So I said: There is no one around the Light (Fire) who is protected (Huma).' Thus are the intentions of literary people and their Tawriyas and descriptions, not as Ibn al-Athir said: 'Medicines in its treatment are not medicines.' People's sayings about the feverish beautiful person are famous, so there is no need to mention them. I had at one time written a letter to some friends complaining of fever. From that: 'He reports, nay complains, of his state for which he has no substitute, and his pains that wounded his limbs so his skin cannot bear cutting that debate (Jadal), and his fever from which a scorpion stings him and a bow shoots him, so would that his body with that were a Ram (Hamal). And the continuity of his sweat's flow regarding which it is not said with its sea: I will seek refuge from beautiful patience to a mountain. So where is their saying: I encountered the sweat of the water-skin from it, compared to one who encountered the drowning of distress from it?'",

    "text": "'When she leaves me, she washes me... As if we were secluded for a forbidden act.' The servant is incapable of describing the headache that happened to his head, and the cracks (Sudu') to his body, and the cutting of his suspended hopes, and his share of the interruptions (Qutu'). Then he said in a section of a letter to the Divan of the Caliphate containing the conquests of a land from the disbelievers: 'And the one traveling with it is So-and-so, and he is the narrator of the news of its victory which she corrected in discrediting (Tajrih) the men, and the high parts of its chain of transmission are taken from the paths of spears (Awali), and the nights and days are narrators for it, so what is the thought regarding the narration of days and nights.' I say: This section with which he ended the letter with which he opposed Al-Qadi Al-Fadil regarding the conquest of Jerusalem. He cited it here as well and claimed this claim in it. It reminded me here of the saying of Mujir al-Din Muhammad ibn Tamim: 'I wonder in war at a knight... the subtleties of my thought were confused about his essence / He gave testimony for me that I am the knight of war... when I wounded (Jarahtu) him in his face.' It is taken from the saying of Ibn al-Sa'ati: 'And how many a time he watered an army the cups of its death... brimming, while the tips of spears (Awali) were stirring sticks / O his sword, you attained uprightness (Adala) against the enemies... And there is no witness but that he has a discrediting (Tajrih) by you.' How sweet is the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil: 'And the servant knew of the riding of our Master Al-Malik Al-Afdal in the center (Qalb). The Sultan was generous to the heart (Qalb) with his heart, and brought it out bare for his war. This position is an explicit text on the Sultanate, and it is an absolute text in which the sword was the judge and victory was the evidence (Bayyina). Islam celebrated a wedding with it, and the scattering was the dinars of the blazes of horses, and the greetings were the basils of the tips of spears. So he is, may Allah strengthen his victory, the preceding in birth and Jihad. His father begot a father, and fathers begot children. Praise be to Allah who aided Islam through him and his sword with Ali and Dhul-Fiqar, and with Omar while in his hand was the sword of Ammar.' What relates to this place are the first two rhymes, but the pen found this melody sweet and said: 'Excused is he who is filled... and drank the cups of wine.' Riddles and Fallacies in Al-Hariri's Maqamat. Then he said in the twenty-first type regarding Riddles (Ahaji): 'Likewise Al-Hariri did in his Maqamat, for he mentioned the riddles which he made according to the rule of Fatwas as metonymy and fallacy, and thought that they are riddles like his saying: Is it permissible for a fasting person to eat during the day?' Then Ibn al-Athir began to deduce that this is from the category of conceptual fallacies. I say: Although I do not know what to say, this man, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, imagines something and binds people to it, and accuses them of its evils while they neither intended nor said it. The Maqamat is a book that became famous, memorized, studied, and not effaced. These issues to which he referred, Al-Hariri, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, deposited in the thirty-second Maqamah. They are one hundred Fatwas, and he listed them arranged according to the chapters of Fiqh. He did not call that a riddle or a puzzle. Rather, he said when mentioning them: 'So a youth, eloquent of tongue, bold of heart, withstood him and said: I debated the jurists of the world, and gathered from them one hundred Fatwas. If you are of those who turn away from daughters of others, and desire provision from us, then listen and answer, to be met with what is incumbent.' He said: 'Allah is Greater, the news will become clear, and the hidden will be revealed, so declare what you are commanded.' He said: 'What do you say regarding one who performed ablution then touched the back of his sandal?' He said: 'His ablution is invalidated by his action.' Until he finished that, and he did not say riddle, puzzle, metonymy, or fallacy. As for the introduction of the book, he said: 'I encrusted it with Arab proverbs, literary subtleties, grammatical riddles, and linguistic fatwas.' He mentioned them in the introduction and in the Maqamah specific to them as Fatwas. Ibn Faris has a book he named 'Fatwas of Language' from which Al-Hariri drew; so what harm is there on Al-Hariri if he calls them Fatwas? The difference between Riddling and Description. Examples of describing ships. He said: On this style came the saying of Abu al-Tayyib regarding ships: 'And he stuffed them (the sea/ships) with runners without legs... barren of bellies, black of bodies / They come with what the horses captured, as if they are... beneath the beauties, the lying places of gazelles.' I say: He counted these as riddles, but they are not of that at all. Rather, they are from the category of descriptions, because a condition of a riddle is that the thing riddled is not mentioned explicitly in the speech. This contradicts that because Abu al-Tayyib said before them: 'Twisting ropes from braids above it... and building ships for him from crosses.' This is explicit. So they are from the category of descriptions, not riddles. Look at the saying of Al-Siraj al-Warraq riddling about a boat: 'And it is not a big thing upon us... and our purpose from it is a small thing / It became one while it is a plural (Jam' - also collection) just as... that illuminating Book came to us.' The first is obvious despite the Tawriya in it. As for the second, the Imams of language have stated that 'Fulk' (ship/ships) is a word in which the singular and plural are equal. I organized a riddle about a ship, saying: 'And a girl (Jariyah - also ship) whose treading is lawful for me... and there was nothing in that to prevent / Oh wonder, she committed no suspicion... yet I compel her to take off (Tuqli' - also set sail).' So Al-Siraj's saying and mine are from the category of riddles, because we did not explicitly mention the word boat or ship. As for Al-Mutanabbi, he explicitly mentioned ships, so he exited this category, and it is from the category of descriptions. Likewise the saying of Mujir al-Din Muhammad ibn Tamim: 'I wondered at the sea when I saw in it... those masts and they exceeded the stars / I think they were only tall because they undertook... carrying letters between the Fulk (ships) and the Falak (orbit/stars).' And his saying also employing implication: 'When we boarded the ship and the sea surged... and its crashing waves raged against us / It walked for us in an abyss with its bellies... just as snakes walk on the ground.' Ibn Qalaqis al-Iskandari is among those who excelled in describing ships in several poems. Among that is his saying mentioning the sea: 'You see the cleavers running in its swelling waves... ascending to its heights and descending / Of every black one like a mole, carried... by a cheek of it in which is shyness for the forenoon.' And his saying also from a poem: 'And I saw the signs (of the Hour) standing in it... because its waves run with mountains / Rising, so were it not for the Book of Allah, it would be true for us... that the heavens have pillars / And we are in a home that travels with its inhabitant... so listen to the tale of a resident whose house is leaving / I refuse, if I spend the night—and from it is in a depiction... of the tightness of a grave and the darkness of a tomb / No side settles for us in its lying place... as if our states are the states of worshippers.' He has things other than these, which I turned away from for fear of prolongation. How sweet is the saying of Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar: 'I was in a raft (Kalakka) flying with a sail... while it hovers around death at times / I look at the wave around it and imagine the... Jim as a Ta out of my fear, while it is a Jim (Mawj -> Mawt) / I did not find in it a warm friend (Hamim)... except that I am bathed (Hamim) in water in it / And if it approaches the land, there becomes... for us a seat and a place of residence / The cliff prostrates whenever the wave bows... so my habit there is Taslim (submission/greeting).' And it is ugly of me to complain of land... and sea, while you are Beneficent (Barr), Merciful.' Ibn al-Sa'ati said, although there is some awkwardness in it: 'When we reached the middle of the Nile in the morning... I thought, while the heart of the day was joyful with amusement / An Ushari (type of ship) was a human whose eye was the water... and it had no eyelids except the oars.' Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may Allah have mercy on him, mentioned ships in several places. Among them his saying: 'And the fleet arrived in fifty galleys (Ghurab - crow), flying with sails as its wings, breaking with the claws of its weapons. It did not visit a gathering but invited it to death, and realized what it incites of separation.' And his saying: 'It fills them against them with runners (Jawar) in the sea like landmarks (mountains), and cities traveling in the abyss as if they were nights taking off with days. They rise upon the assembly of Islam as hopes, and rise upon the disbelievers as dooms. Marked, extended by marked angels. And known, presenting their bows (Hayazim) like the advance of Hayzum (Gabriel's horse) under the bundle.' He said: Better and more delicate than that is the saying of some of them regarding the Anklet (Khalkhal): 'And a beaten one without a crime... beautiful of color, loved / It has the shape of the crescent upon... a beautiful figure, slender / And mostly it is seen forever... upon the combs (feet) in the market (legs/market).' I say: Thus I found it in the copy of Al-Mathal, and I stood upon it also in the book: 'Al-I'jaz fi al-Ahaji wa al-Ilgaz' by Al-Haziri in this form. It is better to say in it: 'It has the likeness of the crescent' or 'the shape of the crescent' or 'the collar of the crescent'. For 'the figure (Qadd) of the crescent' is not appropriate. But this is from his saying previously regarding the apple and the greatness of its figure. I said, riddling about the Anklet: 'What yellow one circulated upon a white one... it softened but its heart is hard / Many a leg (Saq) choked on it, and how... beautiful is this description among people.' I also said about it: 'Oh wonder at a patient, silent one, and it did not... utter a word ever at the time of beating / It stayed and did not leave a place where it settled... although it became revolving around the ankle (Ka'b).' And since a thing is mentioned by a thing, how sweet is the saying of the one riddling about a Bracelet (Dumluj): 'To women it seeks refuge... and with them it is found / Its body is silver... and its heart is rock.'

    "text": "'It became one while it was a plural (collection), just as... that illuminating Book came to us.' As for the first, it is apparent based on the tawriya (double entendre) within it. As for the second, the Imams of language have stated that the word 'Fulk' (ship/ships) is a term used equally for singular and plural. I composed a riddle about a ship, saying: 'And a girl (Jariya) whom it is lawful for me to tread... and there was nothing in that to prevent. Oh wonder, she committed no suspicion... yet I compel her to take off (tuqli' - also means to set sail).' The saying of Al-Siraj and my saying are from the category of riddles, because we did not explicitly mention the word 'Markab' (vehicle/ship) or 'Safina'. As for Al-Mutanabbi, he explicitly mentioned 'Safin' (ships), so he exited this category, and it is from the category of descriptions. Likewise is the saying of Mujir al-Din Muhammad ibn Tamim: 'I marveled at the sea when I saw in it... those masts surpassing the celestial tracks. I think they did not grow tall except because they undertook... carrying letters between the spheres (Falak) and the ships (Fulk).' And his saying, also embedding: 'And when we rode the ships (Fulk) and the sea had surged... and its crashing waves raged against us; It walked with us in an abyss on its bellies... just as vipers walk upon the ground.' Ibn Qalaqis al-Iskandari is among those who excelled in describing ships in several poems. From that is his saying describing the sea: 'You see the prows running in its swelling waves... ascending to its heights and descending. From every black one like a beauty mark, carried by... a cheek of it (the sea) in which there is bashfulness toward the morning.' And his saying also from a poem: 'I saw signs in it standing... because its waves run with mountains (ships). Rising high, were it not for the Book of Allah, it would be true for us... that the heavens have pillars. And we are in a dwelling that travels with its inhabitant... so listen to the tale of a resident whose house is a traveler. I spend the night, if I spend it—and from it is in a pictorial form... of the narrowness of a grave and the darkness of burial. No side settles for us in its bed... as if our states are the states of worshippers.' He has other things besides this, which I omitted for fear of length. How sweet is the saying of Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar: 'I was in a Kalakka (type of ship) flying with a sail... while it hovers over deaths at times. I look at the waves around it and imagine the... Jim as a Ta due to my fear, while it is a Jim (referring to 'Mawj' - wave vs 'Mawt' - death). I did not find in it a warm friend (Hamim)... except that I am bathed (Hamim) in water within it. And when it approached the land, there became... for us from it a seat and a resident. The cliff prostrates whenever the wave bows... so my habit there is Taslim (submission/salutation).' And: 'It is ugly for me to complain of land... and sea, while You are a Merciful Benefactor (Barr Rahim).' Ibn al-Sa'ati said, although there is some awkwardness in it: 'And when we reached the middle of the Nile's extent in the morning... I thought, while the heart of the day was joyful with play, An Ushari (boat) was a human whose eye was the water... and it had no eyelids except the oars.' Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may Allah have mercy on him, mentioned ships in several places. Among them is his saying: 'The fleet arrived in fifty galleys (Ghurab - also means crow/raven), flying with sails as its wings, breaking with the claws of its weapons; it never visited a gathering without inviting it to doom, and realizing what separation (Bayn - also associated with the raven) incites.' And his saying: 'Girls (ships) fill it against them in the sea like mountains, and cities traveling in the abyss as if they are nights setting sail with days. They rise upon us, the assembly of Islam, as hopes, and rise upon the disbelievers as deadlines of death; marked, extended by marked angels, and distinct, their sterns advancing with the advance of Hayzum (Gabriel's horse) under the tightness.' He said: Better and more subtle than that is the saying of someone regarding an anklet (Khalkhal): 'And a hammered one without a crime... beautiful in color, beloved. It has the figure of the crescent upon... a beautiful figure, slender. And mostly it is seen forever... upon the combs (bridges of feet) in the market (legs - Suq).' I say: This is how I found it in the copy of 'Al-Mathal', and I also found it in the book 'Al-I'jaz fi al-Ahaji wa al-Ilghaz' by Al-Haziri in this form. It is better to say in it: 'It has the resemblance of the crescent' or 'the shape of the crescent' or 'the collar of the crescent.' For 'the figure (Qadd) of the crescent' is not suitable. But this is from his saying previously regarding the apple 'and the greatness of its figure (Qadd).' I composed a riddle about the anklet: 'What is a yellow one that turned upon a white one... it softened but its heart is hard. Many a leg (Saq) choked from it, and how... beautiful is this description among people.'

Its body is silver... and its heart is rock (Jalamid).' Al-Safadi's Discussion with Ibn al-Athir regarding his comment on a riddle about a pigeon. He said: I found a riddle by some literati about a pigeon. Then he mentioned it and said after finishing it: 'This is among the eloquent riddles, and it cannot be said of its author that he is, in blindness, losing the cane.' I say: The second rhymed phrase is not suitable for the first in praise and eulogy. The rhyme only wanted him to say after it: 'Nor is he counted among the animals as a beast,' because it (the pigeon/author) was unique in speech and distinguished. I have never seen anyone praise someone with such praise where the context is one of approval, commendation, and praise, by saying: 'He is not, in blindness, losing the cane.' What praise is there in this when he has made him blind with a cane? He is in a worse state than the blind man who walks without a cane. For he who relies on his cane with his blindness has combined blindness of insight with blindness of sight. It appears he wanted to mention the blind poet (Al-Ma'arri or similar), but it did not work out, and he was committed to the letter 'Zay', so he found nothing but 'Al-'Ukkaz' (the cane). The end of this rhyme is the second hemistich of a verse by Abu al-Tayyib (Al-Mutanabbi), which is: 'And he thinks that he is the sighted one regarding this... while he is, in blindness, losing the cane.' From their sayings regarding the Bathhouse (Hammam). Since the bathhouse is mentioned, there is no harm in mentioning some of the words of the later scholars in this locus and citing them. Judge Muhyi al-Din Abdallah ibn Abd al-Zahir, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him, wrote inviting to a bathhouse: 'Would you, may Allah prolong your survival a prolongation that sips from the spring of bliss, and enjoys happiness the enjoyment of flowers with the spring rain and sight with the handsome face, [join] in sharing in combining a garden and a fire, storms and lights, flowers and blossoms, wherein reserve and all shame have vanished, and there is no shame. The stars of its sky are not afflicted by setting, and the plants of its marble are not altered by withering. The elements competed to serve the state within it, a competition in which each excelled in reaching its goals. The sea sent what its body envied of its foam to kiss the hand of his sole, since its ambition fell short of kissing his hand. The dirt did not see an entry for itself in this service, so it intruded and came, not knowing that scrubbing (Tasrih - also dismissal) is for the one who comes intruding. The fire saw that it was the essence of its operation and that by the duty of serving him it does not slacken, and because it has the sanctity of guiding the guest in the night travel, and by it is the repulsion of cold and the benefit of hospitality; so it informed its opposite, the water, and it entered with hot breaths. Its cauldrons boiled, and for that reason, the whisper of the sound of its pouring entered it. The air saw that it fell short of prolonging this competition, so it held back in awe, looking but from behind a glass at that house. Then the trees saw that they had no share in this favor nor a portion in that privacy, so they sent from combs palms that excelled in what the hair-partings call for, and passed through the blackness of the coal-black sideburns just as lightning passes. That is at the hand of a keeper (Qayyim) who stands up for the rights of service, knowing how the people of bliss treat the people of grace, light of hand with trustworthiness, described with dignity among the people of that profession (Mahana), gentle in manners as if they are a reproof between Jahza and Time, and of good craftsmanship so he does not touch a hand except with kindness (Ma'ruf) nor comb except with charity (Ihsan). He is always seen with his purity while he is boastful, and is witnessed removing every harm so that if he served the full moon, he would remove the blemishes from its face. In his hand is a razor as if it were a morning abrogating darkness, or a breeze shaking the calyxes off flowers. When he takes his soap, he makes the one he serves understand, by passing it over his body, that he is a crashing sea, and that the foam of the skin-folds appears from it, which is more beautiful than waves. So come to this pleasure, and do not consider the bathhouse an invitation of the riffraff, for perhaps this one is unique among those invitations.' He also wrote in the presence of a keeper in the Sufah bathhouse:",

    "text": "The poor servant to Allah the Exalted, Abdallah ibn Abd al-Zahir, says that Abu al-Hajjaj Yusuf has ceased not to be a destination for the righteous, and he possesses a quality of craftsmanship by which he deserved to be called a Keeper (Qayyim). How many a body has he graced with a favor, and how many users approached him whose faces were recognized with the radiance of bliss. How often did he strip down with a righteous sheikh in seclusion, and how often did the friend of Allah say 'Good news' (Ya Bushra) because he is Joseph (Yusuf) when he lowered his bucket into the well. How many a human from the scholars and righteous has he served, and how much of their blessing has he stored for a world and an afterlife, thus obtaining from each of them two intercessors: one clothed and one naked. How many human skins thanked him, and how many legs of a righteous man rubbed [against him], so it was verified there that happiness indeed glances at the stone. He has distinguished his family and tribe by the service of the virtuous, and he is thanked for what others are criticized for: the length of the wick (Fatila - also means lint roll from scrubbing). How often did he conclude the washing of a man by giving him his exemption (Bara'a - purity/release) to use, and he exits from a hot bath; so he used it and exited, and it was for him an exemption and a freedom from the Fire. How many a hair-parting did he clarify, and how much grime did he wash away with gray hair, so that which cleaned did not leave [any dirt]. Bodies enjoy his perfuming of his bathhouse with extended shade and poured water, and the abundance of water he brings out almost makes it tube upon tube like a spear. How many clear proofs of heat regarding the increase of water by which ambiguity is removed, and how many ripples curled appearing like lines in every basin, so say: 'This is the Book of Purity, Chapter of Waters.' How many a head did his razor recite to when it brought out greenery from the succession of growth: 'If I had a tongue in every hair follicle spreading thanks, I would [still] be negligent.' I say: It is not hidden what is in this speech of Tawriya (double entendre), Istikhdam (using a word with two meanings), resolving verses, Hadith, and others; and were it not for the fear of elongation, I would have mentioned that. How beautiful is the saying of Al-Nasir Al-Hammami (the bathhouse keeper) and how subtle: 'I have a house whose kindness... pours down as rain like clouds. I accept the one with an excuse in it... and honor the neighbor who is Junub (ritually impure/distant).' And his saying also: 'And you muddied my bathhouse with your absence which... muddies every drinking place of its pleasures. So the chest of the basin was not expanded (happy) by it... nor was the heart of the water in it pleasant.' And he wrote inviting to his bathhouse: 'It is my opinion that you join a seclusion... that has a burning liver and flowing eyes. It observes stars in you from the heat of its heart... and weeps with my tears, happy and sad. Its heart became fond of you, and if you... delay, it becomes in the basins of death (Manun).' People have beautiful things in the praise and dispraise of bathhouses which is not the place to mention for fear of length. Examples of Good Riddles and Discussion on the Difference between Riddle and Allusion. He said: Among the good riddles I heard that occur in dialogues is what is told about Umar ibn Hubayra and Sharik al-Numayri. Umar was traveling on a draft horse of his, and at his side was Sharik al-Numayri. Sharik preceded him in the march, so Umar shouted at him: 'Lower (Ighdid) its bridle.' He said: 'May Allah amend the Amir, she is Maktuba (written/bound).' Umar smiled and then said to him: 'Woe to you, I did not mean this.' Sharik said to him: 'Nor did I mean it.' Umar had intended the saying of Jarir: 'So lower (Faghdid) the glance, for you are from Numayr... so you reached neither Ka'b nor Kilab.' Sharik answered him with the saying of the other: 'Do not feel safe from a Fazari you are alone with... upon your young camel, and write (bound) her with straps (Asyar).' The Difference between Riddle (Lughz) and Allusion (Ta'rid). I say: This and its likes are not riddles at all. For a riddle is to mention a thing with descriptions that others share with it, so the mind returns in that to confusion, not knowing where to direct it to which of the two possesses those descriptions, because they are true from one aspect and false from another. Its derivation is from 'Lughayza', which is a hole the jerboa digs under the earth, making it branched right and left to hide its matter from the one who seeks it; if he seeks it in one, it exits from another. Do you not see that the listener, when he hears the saying of the speaker: 'A girl (Jariya - also ship) who came from India... the journey urges her toward the destination. She has daughters not of her species... in their sharpness, they exceeded the limit. They have horns and she has a hoof... and that is among the strangest things I show. And the most amazing thing is her children... they speak to people in the cradle.'",

    "text": "He begins to say to himself: In the first verse, 'A girl came from India urged by marching,' there is nothing in that. When he hears the second: 'She has daughters not of her species,' he returns to confusion and thinks and says: 'How can they be of a species other than their mother?' When he hears the third: 'They have horns and she has a hoof,' his confusion increases and he says: 'Neither these nor their mother are humans.' When he hears the fourth: 'They speak to people in the cradle,' his confusion is confirmed, then he returns to thinking they are humans because of affirming the cradle and speech, and begins working his mind on an existent described by these qualities. If he is exhausted, he leans towards homonyms, and lands by the power of his thought and correctness of his intuition that it applies only to the Inkstand (Dast) of the writer and his pens (feathers). How sweet is the poet's use of marching, hoof, and speaking. Such is the riddle. The story of Tha'lab, may Allah have mercy on him, is famous with the Bedouin who stood over him and recited a riddle verse by verse. Tha'lab would say: 'This is such-and-such,' then shift in the second to something other than the first interpretation, until when the Bedouin finished his recitation, Tha'lab said: 'This is a pen.' If this is established in the riddle, then what Ibn al-Athir cited is not riddles, but rather from the category of Allusion (Ta'rid) and Signal (Ishara), as if the speaker with such implies to the addressee what was said and points him to an event that occurred. I have not seen anyone count such as a riddle other than Ibn al-Athir, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, although he said in Al-Mathal regarding Metonymy and Allusion: 'It was named Ta'rid (Allusion) because the meaning in it is understood from the side (Ard) of the utterance, meaning from its side; and the Ard of everything is its side.' I say: Likewise the incident of Umar and Sharik; each of them understood his companion's intent from the side of his speech. For 'lowering' is a side of the poet's saying: 'So lower the gaze...' the verse. And likewise 'writing' is a side of his saying: 'And write it with straps.' So it is determined that Allusion is different from Riddle. This Sharik was a man of sharp answers. It is said: The people of Kufa, if one of them wished for something, would say: 'I wish I had the Fiqh of Abu Hanifa, the memorization of Sufyan, the piety of Mis'ar ibn Kidam, and the answer of Sharik.' Similar to the story of Umar and Sharik is what the author of Al-Aghani mentioned. He said: Mu'awiya displayed his horses to Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Hakam. A horse passed by him, so he said: 'How do you see it?' He said: 'This is a swimmer (Sabih).' Then another was displayed to him. He said: 'And this is possessor of repeated run (Dhu 'Ulala).' Then another passed by him, so he said: 'And this is hoarse, neighing (Ajash Hazim).' Mu'awiya said to him: 'Are you using allusion against me?! I knew what you intended. You only alluded to the saying of Al-Najashi: And a swimmer, possessor of repeated run saved Ibn Harb... Hoarse, neighing, while the spears were near. Get out, for you will not dwell with me in a city.' Look at the speech of Mu'awiya, may Allah be pleased with him, how he explicitly used the word Allusion in two places. Literary scholars have cited a group of this category in their books. As for Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-Sayyid al-Batalyusi, he cited this incident of Sharik and Umar ibn Hubayra in the commentary on Adab al-Katib, then said after finishing it: 'Ibn Hubayra alluded to him with the saying of Jarir, and Sharik alluded to him with the saying of Salim ibn Dara.' He cited examples of this incident, and in all of them he says: 'Alluded.' This is explicit from such a man, and he is an Imam in what he says and his saying is a proof. How beautiful is the saying of the one who said, and how delicate: 'Pour me a wine like the thinness of my religion... or like my mind, and I do not say like my state / Fearful of people imagining that I... said this as an allusion (Ma'rad) to begging.' Among allusion is the saying of Al-Siraj al-Warraq alluding to a request for soap: 'I sent the letter to you and my walking was little... on my head to your door with the letter / And my excuse to you for the delay is that I... the inkstand spilled on my clothes.' I copied from the handwriting of Al-Siraj al-Warraq, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, what reads: 'Abu al-Husayn the Grammarian used to sit at a drink-seller's. One day he came and found a rose-water bottle (Qumqum) in his place. The seller said to him: O our master, we will remove the bottle and you sit. He said to him: How, when you commanded me to stand twice by your saying: Qumqum (Stand Stand)?! It happened that someone gifted me a bottle, so I recited to him: If that one said: Stand Stand (Qum Qum), driving away... his sitter with a signal in the bottle (Qumqum) / Then I am the one whose luck made time sit... so it brought that to him and called: Stand Stand.' Principles and Openings. He said in the twenty-second type regarding Principles and Openings:",

    "text": "'Among the skill in this chapter is to make the prayer at the beginning of Sultani and fraternal correspondences and others imply the meaning upon which that letter is built. This is something I was unique in inventing, and you see it often in what I composed.' Then he said: 'Among that is what I mentioned in congratulating on a newborn, which is: May Allah renew the joys of the So-and-so Assembly, and send the morning drink of its happiness with its evening drink, and make him enjoy his scion (Salil) who is heralded by his rising (Turuq), and preserve him until he seeks light by his opinion and shoots from me over him (referring to arrow), and gladden the virgins of high qualities with him until he perfumes their sides with his perfume (Khuluq), and make him like a crop that brought forth its shoot, then strengthened it, so it became thick and stood upon its stem (Suq).' I say: This is after he criticized Al-Sabi and a group of poets regarding openings, and claimed this claim, then came with such an opening in congratulating on a newborn. There is nothing in the first rhyme indicating that the congratulation is for a newborn, circumcision, wedding, conquest, Eid, recovery from illness, or other types of joys; it indicated absolute congratulation. As for his saying: 'and gladden the virgins of high qualities with him until he perfumes their sides with his perfume,' I do not know what rhetoric is in this. I wrote in congratulating on a newborn: 'And he adorned the horizon of happiness with his star which became rising, and made him reach in his youth the highest prides until he is, before puberty, reaching the goals of high qualities, and occupied sovereignty with him, for its heart was empty except of this house.' I also wrote: 'And He preserved for the forest of kingdoms its cub, and made him a vanguard of glad tidings for what is after him just as he came as a rearguard of good for what was before him, and qualified him to be an Imam in front of the ranks of war, just as He made his face a collector for beauty and his hand a Qibla for the kiss.' I also wrote: 'And He cooled his eye with this joy (Qurrah), and made him reach the ends of his hopes in him of fortunes, for they are interpreted in this margin (Turrah), and made the afternoon the saffron of this perfume (Khuluq) and the twilight the carnelian/aqiqa sacrifice of this pearl (Durrah).' I wrote a reply to a letter that arrived accompanied by details of embroidered cloth. I said: 'The hand kisses the extended one (Basita), may the sentences of its generosity not cease to be thanked in details (Tafasil), and the masterpieces of its embroidered kindness perform for its friend what he wills of niches and images (Tamathil), and the engravings of its gifts shoot the souls of enemies with destruction from their flocks of birds (Ababil).' Regarding congratulating on a child. Among what came in the speech of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him: 'And this blessed child is the one completing twelve children, nay twelve burning stars. Allah has increased him in his stars over the stars of Joseph by a star. The Master saw them while awake and he saw that in a dream. He saw them prostrating to him and we saw creation prostrating to them. He is capable of increasing the boundaries of the Master until he sees them as a father and grandfathers.' From his speech also: 'It is announced that Allah, and to Him belongs praise, granted Al-Malik Al-Aziz, may his victory be glorified, a blessed, high, male, sound, pure, pious child, from offspring some of whom is from others, and from a house whose kings almost became angels in heaven and whose slaves became kings on earth, at the beginning of the crescent of Jumada. So for this night are two blazes and two crescents, heralding heavy rains, truthful.' 'The servant issued this service heralding that Allah Almighty does not leave our Master at any time without an increase of children He grants, or an increase of lands he conquers. So he is every day given glad tidings of what is facilitated for him. The orbit runs with what we hope for him and is fixed for him. Its stars rise upon him star by star, and its clouds pour upon him shower by shower. It has been narrated in the tradition that the child is the basil of Paradise; so noble houses based on this are gardens, and righteous children based on this are basils. May our garden not be effaced, nor our basil wither, and may the grandfather of the sons of our Master, who is their grandfather and their father and our Sultan, be high.' Ibn al-Athir claimed that he was the one unique in the appropriateness of openings, while this is what most people have always observed. Ibn Khalaf stated that in 'Al-Manthur al-Baha'i', saying: 'Among that is the opening of a letter to the Divan of the Caliphate,' and he listed the introduction of the letter, and at its end: 'And the letter and its gift might be expressed as the cloud and its downpour. If it issued from a hand like the hand of the Noble Divan, the simile has fallen in the place of correctness, and the saying of the sayer became true then, that the sea is the element of the cloud.' I say: This is not verification at all. Whoever claims that the cloud comes from the sea has no knowledge of the reality of that. How can it be when the sea is salty and bitter, and the drops sent down from clouds are sweet and fresh? It was interpreted in His Almighty's saying: 'And in the heaven is your provision and what you are promised' that it is the clouds that rain. If it were as he claimed, He would have said: 'And in the sea is your provision.' Allah Almighty said: 'Allah is the one who sends the winds, so they stir up clouds,' making the cause of the cloud's origin the sending of winds, and He did not mention the sea. How beautiful is the saying of Ibn Zaydun: 'To the intercessor belongs praise and thanks in the downpour... of rain, to the winds not to the clouds'",

    "text": "[This is] a reference to the meaning of the noble Verse. Even if a transmission trusted for its truthfulness came regarding that, it is returned via interpretation to this. Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri said: 'And the bounty of the clouds may be begged for, while... it is from the sea, as people claim, that we beg.' He guarded himself by saying: 'as people claim.' Meaning: in the apparent. Even if the matter in the hidden is contrary to that. How beautiful is the saying of Al-Husayn ibn Mutayr describing rain: 'If its water were from the depths of the coasts... no water would remain in the depths of the coasts.' Perhaps some ignorant people might dispute and say: 'Clouds are from the sea, but the winds shorten (condense) it so it becomes sweet.' Similar to this is the saying of Al-Tihami: 'Like the sea, the clouds rain it, and they have... no merit over it because they are from its water.' What is appropriate for this place is nothing other than pointing out that rain is not from the [salt] sea [directly], and that the sea is not the element of clouds. Other than that can be taken from the books of this art in the Natural Sciences (Tabi'iyyat). How sweet is the saying of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him: 'His letter arrived and the spring and its time had passed, and its roses had returned and dismantled its watering place. So its lines substituted and excelled in substitution, and people knew the kinship between him and the spring, nay the brotherhood, for their mother is the cloud.' He said: Among the letters referred to is the opening of a letter I wrote to some brothers, and I sent it to him from Mosul. Then he mentioned the letter. When he finished it, he exclaimed 'Bakh Bakh' (Bravo) to himself and praised it, and cited other letters regarding the praise of incoming correspondence. Among them is some beauty of beneficence; but if you compared them to the speech of Al-Fadil, you would say: 'A youth, but not like Malik; and a pasture, but not like the Sa'dan.' From the Beauties is opening the Letter with a Verse or Hadith or a Line of Poetry. He said: Among the beauties of this art is that the letter is opened with a verse from the signs of the Quran, or a report from the Prophetic reports, or a line of poetry, then the letter is built upon it. From that is what I wrote in the beginning of a letter containing the good news of a conquest, which is: 'And whoever seeks the glorious conquest, then... its keys are the white, light, sharp swords.' We have taken the saying of this wise poet, and made the sword a means to producing sterile (unprecedented) kingship. I say: Among the beauties I found of this type is a letter written by Judge Muhyi al-Din ibn Abd al-Zahir, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him, in reply to Amir Shams al-Din Aqsunqur, regarding a letter that arrived from him about the conquest of the lands of Nubia. He opened it after the Basmala with the Almighty's saying: 'And We made the night and the day two signs, then We erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible.' 'May Allah perpetuate the grace of the Council (Al-Majlis), and may his determinations remain feared, and his spoils brought and driven, and his power and these steps of his restrain misfortunes (Nuwab) and the Nubians (Nuba). May his tread upon the disbelievers remain severe, and his hopes for destroying the enemies remain extended like his spears, and may the state never lack the white blades of his swords by which \"you see those who lied against Allah, their faces blackened.\"' This correspondence was issued to the Council praising his determinations which complied with every right command, and finished off every stubborn tyrant, and judged with the justice of the sword regarding every bad servant—'And your Lord is not unjust to the servants.' Where it thanked the short-haired horses and praised the camels. The day of victory resembled its yesterday due to the substitution of weak letters (grammar metaphor), so the raid on the church of Sawsan became like the raid of Sis. And we inform him that we knew the bounty of Allah in purifying the lands from their filth, removing the stubbornness, cauterizing the material of their majority—the disbeliever—when he had almost plotted and plotted, and hastening the Festival of Sacrifice (Eid al-Nahr) by sacrificing every ram of war that kneels in blackness, looks in blackness, and walks in blackness. We have verified the victory that healed souls and removed misery, and erased the sign of the night with the best of suns, and destroyed Dongola for the crime of Saws (weevils/decay), and how can something not be destroyed when there is Saws in it.",

    "text": "'So praise be to Allah that the resolves of the Seat greeted them in the morning with woe, and that He inserted the day of the sword from them into the night, and that He turned the war of their spears back to their throats, and made their destruction in their planning, and distinguished the white line of the sword from the black thread of the dawn of their immorality. He informed the present mind of the Seat about the unseen matters of victory, and made the believing Solomon of the time inherit the kingdom of the disbelieving David. He coupled victory with the most rising resolve of the Seat, and destroyed the black enemy with the auspicious white bird of victory—and how not, when Aqsunqur is the White Bird (Falcon). He cooled every eye for the people of Upper Egypt, and gathered their unity so they do not see after it the Crow of Separation (Ghurab Bayn) from their enemy. He granted victory to the owners of swords over the owners of spears (Harab), and facilitated the hunting of their king at the hand of the Seat—and how can hunting the Crow be difficult for the Falcon (Sunqur)? Thanks be to Allah for humiliating their king who softened and weakened, and He humiliated him with His might which the evil of each of them declared in fighting him, so he ended up naked. And perishing them with tongues whose stabbing became like the mouth of the waterskin when the waterskin is full. And crushing their napes with the sword which Allah made the non-Arab bird speak with its omen, saying: Daqq Qafa al-Sudan (Crush the nape of the blacks). May Allah preserve the Jihad of the Seat which straightened this bent accident. Islam did not lack in this affair a sword that stood as a preacher (Khatib)—and how not, when He dressed it in black (Abbasi color/ink) from them. And thanked him for his resolve with which the frowning face of time rejoiced, and the lands of the North realized the welfare of the lands of the South through it. The arrows of spoils became aimed in every direction through it, and the backs of conquests are ridden, so at times the sword rides every Sis and at times every Adham (black horse/fetter). And praised his bravery against whose shock the great multitude (Sawad A'zam) did not stand. To Allah is the favor that He made the quarters of the enemy harvested by the resolves of the Seat as if they had not flourished yesterday, and established the duties of Jihad with his sharpened swords and his five fingertips. He coupled his firmness with delivering the stab to the throats of enemies, and the time of sacrifice (Nahr) is the measure of a spear from the rising of the sun. We hope from the generosity of Allah to catch the sought David and return him to the sword with the defect of his flight; and the bad slave, if he flees, is returned inevitably with the defect of flight. Allah thanks the details of the Seat's letters and their summaries, the last of his raids and the first, the combat of his sharp swords and their lodging. And may He make him, when the day of his sword withdraws from the night of this enemy, return safe to his resting place, and the sun runs to a resting place for it.' I recorded this letter in its entirety because of the delightful witticisms and strange Tawriyas in it. Judge Muhyi al-Din, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, has two verses on this incident, and it is said they belong to Ibn al-Naqib. They are: 'O day of Dongola and the killing of its slaves... in every side and every place / From every Nubian saying to his mother... Wail (Nuhi), for they have crushed the nape of the blacks (Daqqu Qafa al-Sudan).' On Transition (Takhallus) and Improvisation (Iqtidab). He said in the twenty-third type regarding Transition and Improvisation, and cited the saying of Abu Tammam from a set of verses: 'No, by the One who knows that distance is... a term (Ajal) and that Abu al-Husayn is generous.' Then he said: This is an exit from Ghazal to praise. I say: What is famous in this verse is that Abu Tammam said it: 'No, by the One who knows that distance is... patience (Sabr)...' I have not seen anyone cite it like that (Ajal), nor have I found it in a Diwan despite the many copies except as I mentioned (Sabr). As for the masters of rhetoric, they mentioned the verse and counted it among the defects, because there is no relevance between patience and generosity. If it were said: 'Time is miserly and Abu al-Husayn is generous,' or he says 'Distance is patience and connection is honey,' it would be appropriate. No one mentioned it to my knowledge except counting it as a defect, and this one counted it among the beauties and changed its wording. Justice is other than this; would that he corrected it when he changed it. There is no harm in citing a portion of what came for poets in this genre. Among that is the saying of Al-Ma'arri Abu al-Ala mentioning she-camels: 'They asked, so I said our destination is Sa'id... So the name of the Emir was a good omen for them.' And the saying of Muslim ibn al-Walid: 'My companions say, while they strove in haste... and horses pulled at the bridles with the riders / Is it the rising place of the sun you intend to take us to? ... I said: No, but the rising place of generosity.' Abu Tammam took it, a taking and a slicing, saying: 'Is it the rising place of the sun you intend to take us to? ... I said: No, but the rising place of bounty.' Al-Ghazzi also took it, and molded it confusedly when he said: 'She says when we urged them and she remained... whispering to us with tongues of fatigue / Is it to the horizon of the crescent my riders travel? ... We said: No, but to the horizon of giving.' And the saying of Ali ibn al-Jahm: 'And a night whose eye was kohl-ed with ink... threw the veil of darkness into every trench.'",

    "text": "'Its waves of darkness almost drown me... Were it not for my borrowing light from the face of Dawud.' And the saying of the leader Abu Abdullah al-Sanbasi praising Sayf al-Dawla Sadaqa ibn Mansur: 'And a wet narcissus whose eyes resemble... pupils of gold on eyelids of camphor / As if its scent in every morning... is musk diffusing or the mention of Ibn Mansur.' And the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk: 'The yearning lover does not turn back from passion... Or Al-Malik Al-Aziz turns back from generosity.'

And the saying of Ibn al-Sa'ati: 'My passion, even if I am the humble one by his whites (swords)... Al-Aziz found it with every brown flexible spear.'

And better than all this is the saying of Sheikh Sharaf al-Din Abdul Aziz, Sheikh of the Sheikhs in Hama, from a ghazal poem praising the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: 'Whoever saw that fasting sash (belt)... prayed upon Muhammad.' And the saying of Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar praising Jamal al-Din Musa bin Yaghmur: 'I dared to kiss the anemone on her cheek... and sip saliva I am still drunk from / And I do not fear the magic of her glances... because through Musa (Moses) I have become safe from magic.'

Regarding the Transition (Mukhallis), how sweet is the saying of Al-Siraj al-Warraq: 'If my chest is light for rhymes and organizing them... Then in grace and the shade of generosity, I am restricted / And how many a beginning (Matla') I composed for a poem... Jesus says to me: Or perhaps there is a way out (Mukhallis) for you.' And it was witty of one who dispraised the transition in one verse where he said: 'While locks of hair of the one he loves were in his palm... until the beard of the praised one got stuck.' Transition in the Holy Quran. He said: And Abu al-Ala Muhammad bin Ghanim, known as Al-Ghanimi, said: The Book of Allah is free from Takhallus (poetic transition). It is only the exit from one speech to another speech via a subtlety that harmonizes the two speeches, the one exited from and the one entered into. Regarding examples of that which Ibn al-Athir cited from the Holy Quran. Then Ibn al-Athir said: And in the Quran are many places. Among them: And he began citing what he cited. Like His Almighty's saying: 'And recite to them the news of Abraham, when he said to his father and his people: What do you worship?...' to the end of the story, and other than that. I say: What Ibn al-Athir mentioned does not go beyond what Al-Ghanimi said; for the Quran is all connected to one another, such as exiting from preaching and reminding to warning, or to glad tidings, or to a command, or prohibition, or promise, or threat, except for what its connection is hidden in appearance. Imam Fakhr al-Din observed this in his exegesis and spoke about the relationship of the verse to what follows it. Ibn al-Athir did not understand Al-Ghanimi's speech nor know his intent, which is that he meant the Takhallus that poets agreed upon, which is for the poet to transition within a single verse from ghazal or blame or description to praise. Such a thing I do not know to have occurred in a single verse (of Quran). As for the connection of a verse to what precedes it, only a little deviates from this, and that is in appearance; otherwise, when a person contemplates it and reflects on it with true reflection, he will not find it cut off except in what is known to be improvisation (Iqtidab). Models of Transition in Ibn al-Athir's composition. He said: Something of transitions came to me in prose composition in many things. Among that is what I mentioned in a letter to some brothers describing spring, then I exited from that to mentioning longings. So I said: 'Just as these descriptions are beautiful in their affair, so too is my longing beautiful in its affair, except that its meter (sea) is a summer season and this is a spring season.'\n\n'Its waves of darkness almost drown me... were it not for my borrowing light from the face of Dawud.'

    "text": "I say: This man has cited examples of poets' transitions, like Abu Tammam, Abu al-Tayyib, Al-Buhturi, and others, yet he did not notice the transition and its beauty. Can such a thing be counted among transitions? If he had said: 'And an anemone tore its sleeves, raised its flags, filled its cup with wine, revealed its red cheek with a black mole in it, and kindled its fire resembling the embers of my longings and its intensity,' people would have counted this as a transition. Then he mentioned another section on cold, and claimed he transitioned to longing, and it is of this ratio. Then he mentioned another section on a gift, and transitioned from it to intercession, and it is of this type. Then he mentioned a section on mentioning affection, and transitioned to asking for fresh dates, and it is of this category. Proportion between meanings and discussion of examples of that. He said in the twenty-fourth type regarding proportion between meanings, after citing the saying of the poet: 'Behold, O son of those who perished and died... By Allah, they did not die for you to remain / And you possess—so know—a station in it... When you have completed terms (Ajala - plural) and provision (Rizqa - singular).' And he denied the lack of proportion between the singular 'provision' and the plural 'terms', and considered it ugly: 'I used to see this type as obligatory in usage, and that it is not good to deviate from it, until I came across in the Quran what contradicts it. Like His Almighty's saying: 'Do they not see what Allah has created of a thing, its shadows return from the right (Yamin - singular) and the lefts (Shama'il - plural).' And he cited His Almighty's saying: 'Those are the ones upon whose hearts, hearing (singular), and sights (plural) Allah has set a seal.' And His Almighty's saying: 'Until when they come to it, their hearing, their sights, and their skins testify against them.' I say: There is no doubt regarding the poet's saying: 'terms and provision', that it is defective and counted as a lack of proportion between meanings, and scholars of rhetoric have mentioned it and stated it. If he had said: 'a term and provisions' it would have been lesser, for the term (lifespan) is one, and provision is multiple. Correct taste refuses such a thing. As for his citing these verses, the plural did not come with the singular except for a wisdom Ibn al-Athir did not view. That wisdom is greater and grander than observing proportion. It casts to the side of the left so it is one, but when the sun declines and returns to the side of the west, the shadow reverses and takes from the north, then becomes bit by bit, and its increases multiply and the erectness is ordained. Likewise for facing the Qibla and the honor of its direction. Leave this aside, for the word 'Shama'il' (lefts) is sweeter in plural than singular and more delightful, and it is the habit of Arabs to observe the lightness of words and their sweetness despite the lack of proportion in meanings. And you have decided that there are words that are heavy when singular and light when plural. As for 'Hearing' in the two noble verses, it was singular because it is a verbal noun (Masdar), and the verbal noun applies to the few and the many. If it falls among plurals, it takes their ruling, and if it falls among singulars, it is in their ruling. In general, pluralizing verbal nouns is awkward (Iyy), because the meaning of multitude is present in them, or because it implies the deletion of a possessive noun (Mudaf) which is not good in others, as if He Almighty said: 'And upon the margins of their hearing.' And the like does not hold true for sights and hearts. As for sights, because they are not sealed but covered. As for hearts, because they are not contained within what has margins upon which the seal falls; rather, the seal is upon the hearts themselves, not their margins. Of this is His Almighty's saying: 'And He made darkness (plural) and light (singular),' because darkness comes from thick bodies, and light from fire. So likewise the Right and the Lefts. Discussing Ibn al-Athir regarding Economy, Negligence, and Excess. He said in the twenty-fifth type regarding Economy, Negligence, and Excess, when mentioning Negligence: Know that praise has words specific to it, and blame has words specific to it. A group has gone deep into this until they said: It is of manners not to address Kings and those close to them with the 'Kaf' of address (singular 'You'). This is a cold error, for Allah, who is the King of Kings, was addressed with the 'Kaf' in the beginning of His Noble Book, where it was said: 'It is You (Iyyaka) we worship and You (Iyyaka) we ask for help.' And similar examples appeared in limited places in the Quran. I say: His citing this is not something that refutes the saying of those who went to say that manners in addressing Kings and those close to them should not be with the 'Kaf', because this is the Opening of the Book (Al-Fatiha) and is recited in every Rak'ah, and the Noble Quran was only revealed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and among its benefits is declaring Allah Almighty free from partner, child, and wife. If it were said: 'It is You (plural) we worship and You (plural) we ask for help,' it would imply to the polytheists and Christians what they say of multiple gods, and would be a doubt for those claiming that.\n\nI say: This man has cited examples of poets' transitions, like Abu Tammam, Abu al-Tayyib, Al-Buhturi, and others, yet he did not notice the transition and its beauty.

    "text": "A letter arrived from the island of Cyprus via William the Frankish merchant in the year seven hundred and twenty approximately, and I stood upon it in the city of Safed. I found its author arguing for the validity of the Christians' doctrine in saying the Trinity, using transmitted things from the Great Quran. Like His Almighty's saying: 'He said, My Lord, return me (Irji'un - plural imperative)' and 'And sufficient are We as reckoners.' And with such verses, and with other things that are laughable to use as evidence. Then he began to argue for the Trinity with His Almighty's saying: 'They said, We worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac,' mentioning three, and this is something laughable. Although some of the Rafidah (Shia) have an argument for the validity of marrying nine (women) from this type. It is His Almighty's saying: 'Marry what pleases you of women, two and three and four.' He said: This total sum is nine, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, died leaving nine wives. As for this Cypriot letter; Sheikh Taqi al-Din ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, answered it in two volumes, and engaged with it for a while and was fond of it. If you say: With the likes of His Almighty's saying: 'My Lord, return me (plural)' and 'Sufficient are We as reckoners', it becomes problematic for you regarding what you established in the Fatiha. I say: It is established for us in the Quran from other than this, and proofs were established for Oneness by the likes of His Almighty's saying: 'If there were therein gods besides Allah, they would have both been ruined.' When such comes, we know that the intended meaning is magnification. People only took addressing the great with the plural wording from the Great Quran. The reason the magnified one himself says: 'We did' and 'We commanded'... and the like, is because only one who is obeyed and magnified among his people says this, and the obeyed one is only he who has followers and servants who speak by his saying and return to what he says. Like the owner of a school of thought says: 'Our opinion' and 'Our school', meaning I and those who say this saying. For this reason, the jurists and debaters, one of them says: 'We do not concede,' while he is one and no other, and the meaning is 'I prevent this, I and whoever agrees with my saying.' Since the speaker, when he was great, said: 'We did,' his address was carried upon that, so it was said to him: 'You (plural) did,' so that it would be a correspondence to what he says. As for this age, people have rested from addressing Kings in their correspondences and other than their correspondences with the 'Kaf' and with the plural pronoun. For it is only said: 'The Noble Decrees', 'The High Opinions', 'The Noble Charities', and 'The Noble Doors', except what is too high in honor to be described as such, like: The Stable, the Camel-rest, and the Kitchens and the like, for they are described as 'The Happy' (Al-Sa'ida). And if the speaker is before the Sultan, he says: 'The Head of our Master the Sultan, may Allah perpetuate his kingdom,' and everything he mentions, he adds to this sentence. The preference between the namings 'Irsad' (Preparation) and 'Tawshih' (Sashing). He said in the twenty-eighth type regarding Irsad: I saw Abu Hilal al-Askari naming this type: 'Al-Tawshih'. It is not so, rather naming it 'Al-Irsad' is more appropriate. I say: This 'Irsad' which he went to saying is more fitting than 'Tawshih' for the meaning he decided, its example is the saying of Al-Buhturi: 'She made lawful my blood on the day of separation and forbade... without cause, on the day of meeting, my speech / And the one she made lawful was not lawful (to kill)... And the one she forbade was not forbidden (Harim).' It is that the poet brings a half-verse from which the second half is understood, or a beginning from which the end is understood, or from the part the whole is understood. It is proof of mastery and quality of nature. The face of appropriateness between this meaning and 'Tawshih' is to place the beginning of the speech and its end in the position of the shoulder and the flank, and place the indication of what is in its beginning to its end in the position of the sash (Wishah) roaming over them. This is a meaning fitting for this name, and the word itself is sweeter to the ear than 'Irsad'. He said: A group has followed in prose speech and poetry paths outside the subject of the science of Bayan (Rhetoric), and they are far from it, because they are in a valley and the science of Bayan is in a valley. Among those who did that is Al-Hariri, the author of the Maqamat, for he mentioned that letter which is one dotted word and one undotted word, and the letter where one letter of its words is dotted and the other undotted. And others organized poetry where the end of each verse is the beginning of the verse that follows it. All of this, even if it involves hardship of craft, is outside the door of eloquence and rhetoric. I say: Al-Hariri, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, did not bring what he brought of these types claiming that this is eloquence and rhetoric. Rather, he brought that to exhaust the types of literature (Adab), and show the literati what is required for them to know. All of that is proof of ability and mastery. If Al-Hariri had done that in all the Maqamat, it would not have been good.\n\nA letter arrived from the island of Cyprus via William the Frankish merchant in the year seven hundred and twenty approximately, and I stood upon it in the city of Safed.

It is that the poet brings a half-verse from which the second half is understood, or a beginning from which the end is understood, or from the part the whole is understood. It is proof of mastery and quality of nature. The face of appropriateness between this meaning and 'Tawshih' is to place the beginning of the speech and its end in the position of the shoulder and the flank, and place the indication of what is in its beginning to its end in the position of the sash (Wishah) roaming over them. This is a meaning fitting for this name, and the word itself is sweeter to the ear than 'Irsad'. He said: A group has followed in prose speech and poetry paths outside the subject of the science of Bayan (Rhetoric), and they are far from it, because they are in a valley and the science of Bayan is in a valley. Among those who did that is Al-Hariri, the author of the Maqamat, for he mentioned that letter which is one dotted word and one undotted word, and the letter where one letter of its words is dotted and the other undotted. And others organized poetry where the end of each verse is the beginning of the verse that follows it. All of this, even if it involves hardship of craft, is outside the door of eloquence and rhetoric. I say: Al-Hariri, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, did not bring what he brought of these types claiming that this is eloquence and rhetoric. Rather, he brought that to exhaust the types of literature (Adab), and show the literati what is required for them to know. All of that is proof of ability and mastery. If Al-Hariri had done that in all the Maqamat, it would not have been good.",

    "text": "Such things like the riddle, the puzzle, the catch-questions, bringing a dotted word followed by an undotted one, and a dotted letter followed by an undotted one, or the beginning of a verse being such and its end such... all of that is suitable for Maqamat. As for correspondence and sermons, it is disliked and found heavy. Because correspondence is not intended for showing jurisprudence in literature, but is rather for congratulation, condolence, thanks, praise, description, seeking sympathy, blame, longing, or other than that. Such things do not befit affectation. However, even if these types are in the Maqamat, they should be like small flashes, for if they increase, they become ugly. Do you not see that Al-Imad al-Katib, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, when he made his speech laden with Jinass (paronomasia) such that hardly a word is free from it, it became heavy on ears and hearts, and did not have the lightness of Al-Qadi Al-Fadil's speech on hearts. A poet might be excellent, so he brings a type of affectation without the trace of burden upon it. Like the saying of Ibn Hamdis: 'With side-locks like Zirfan (chain-links), his glance attacks playfully... the creation, joyful if I complain of passion, laughing / Do not expose yourself to a rose upon his cheek... for his eye only set it as a trap.' The first gathers all the dotted letters without the burden showing on it. Likewise the saying of the sayer: 'Clever (Labiq), a slender one approached (Aqbala) in it... Every (Kull) thing I own, if he sings, give it (Habhu).' For every two words of this, their meaning does not change by reversal (palindrome) except the rhyme, for it is known in itself. And there is no trace of burden on it. Similar to it also: 'A green land in which is... a slender one pouring a cup.' Also the saying of the sayer: 'The God showed us... a crescent that illuminated.' Also the saying of the sayer: 'You kill, you sin... you tyrannize, you regret.' If reversed and misspelled (dots changed), it becomes: 'Melter of my soul, when do we meet.' Similar to it is the saying of the sayer: 'The qualities of my killer fluttered... so for that my soul does not rest / The beloved returned his answer... so it is as if it is pearls in wording.' The beginning of every verse is the reverse of the last word of it. And there is no burden on it. As for Ibn al-Athir, it seems he thinks that literature (Adab) is only correspondence, and he did not know that it is a part of it, even if a large part and a majestic type. The least heavy of these affectations is what is entirely undotted (Muhmal), nay, it is not counted as heavy at all, but is light and sweet to the ear and heart. Like the saying of Al-Hariri: 'Prepare for your enviers the sharpest weapon... And lead the hopeful to the watering place of generosity.' The poem is entirely of utmost beauty. I found for Al-Qadi Al-Fadil, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, a sermon he composed for the entry of the New Year, and it is long, all of it stripped of dotting, and it is of utmost beauty. Were it not for fear of length, I would have recorded it. I found Al-Warraq al-Haziri had taken pains in things of these types. Among them are two verses every word of which has a Hamza. They are: 'By my father is a soft one who melted my heart... when he distanced himself and showed turning away (I'rad) / A gazelle (Rasha') accustomed to harshness, so if he approaches... he shows to those hoping for him contraction (Inqibad).' Regarding 'Inqibad' there is a view; the saying of Abu al-Tayyib almost: 'I aim (Ummi) for Abu al-Fadl the Beneficent (Al-Mubirr), my oath... I will indeed aim for the greatest sea in essence.' This is from this necessity, and in it with the repetition of Hamza is the repetition of Shaddas. Among that is a piece which, if read, the lips do not move (Labials omitted). It is: 'Here I am, bare of skin (patience)... He who slept kept me awake / Ah for an eye that looked... at a gazelle possessing softness / You showed me, O my viewer... the hunting of the gazelle by the lion / Indeed, wasting away due to his abandonment... O my blamer, destroyed the body / My entrails were stuffed when he distanced... the fire of Ghada wood when he fled / O treacherous one who left me... upon the blaze of a fire burning / Will you not treat kindly a thin one... who does not complain to anyone.' Among that is a piece, the first halves are dotted, and the seconds are undotted. From it: 'In me is passion (Shaghaf) that ignited (Shabba) between my sides... Its medicine is affection and connection / He broadcasts my grief, hidden in anger... A haw-eyed one whose promise is impossible / Adorned with two things: coquetry of an eyelid... and salt of coyness that has perfection.' He said: On this style came the saying of some of them: 'And a youth from Mazin... who surpassed the people of Basra / His mother is Definite (Ma'rifa)... and his father is Indefinite (Nakira).'

    "text": "I say: How deserving these two verses are of doubt, and how worthy their composer is of a slap! What beauty is in them and what delicacy, with these heavy words in his use of 'Basra' with a vowel on the Sad (Basara), and what is in them of meter defect (Zihaf) even if permissible. Is there anything in them other than mentioning Definite and Indefinite? What great matter is in that! If the writers of this age wanted to use the chapters of grammar and titles of syntax from the beginning of the art to its end in whatever meaning they wanted, they would do so. As for prose, I found for Judge Muhyi al-Din ibn Abd al-Zahir, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, a note he wrote as intercession via a person to a great man. It is: 'May the banner (Alam - also Flag) of his knowledge remain Raised (Marfu') forever, and the structure (Bina') of his glory Erected (Mansub) by the Lowering (Khafd) of the enemies. May the letters of his pens remain Jussive (Jazima) to the verbs of doubt, and the delegations of fortunes Transitive (Muta'addiya) away from his enemies and Intransitive/Binding (Lazima) to his allies. It is conveyed that So-and-so attended and mentioned that his name is Apocopated (Murakham) without Calling (Nida'), and Truncated (Juzima) while Truncation (Jazm) does not enter upon Nouns (Asma'). He was Excepted (Istuthniya) without a cause by Lowering (Khafd), and Lowering is not among the tools of Exception. He claimed that the Operator (Amil) that entered upon him prevented him from Conjugation (Tasarrun) and bound him with the binding of Indeclinability (Bina'). He entered with him into the Condition (Shart) and singled him out in the Penalty (Jaza'). The Influencer (Mu'aththir) - may Allah support him - Erected (Nasaba) his place upon Praise (Madh) not upon Incitement (Ighra'), and Raised (Rafa') his name, stripped of Operators (Awamil), upon Inception (Ibtida'). In him is of Distinction (Tamyiz) and Adverbial status (Zarf) what necessitates Conjunction (Atf) for him, and of Justice (Adl) and Knowledge (Ma'rifa) what prevents him from Morphological Change (Sarf). May the door of our Master remain for the Returner (A'id) and the Connection (Sila), and the state of his status widespread, not Transitive (Muntaqila).' Look at the craft of this writer in this letter, how delicately he brought this grammatical terminology in the meaning of intercession, prayer, and praise for the one he interceded to, from the beginning of his speech to its end. As for poetry, poets have played with it often, and it is famous. How sweet is the saying of Al-Baha Zuhayr: 'Your Zayd did not fulfill his wish (Watar) from your connection... Nor did he spend his night or dawn in your abandonment / You left my news (Khabari) in abandonment a Subject (Mubtada)... And every Definite (Ma'rifa) of mine became in passion Indefinite (Nakira).' In the two verses cited by Ibn al-Athir, there is nothing but the metonymy regarding the mentioned person that he is a child of adultery whose father is unknown. How beautiful is the saying of Ibn Unayn satirizing Ibn Sayyida: 'Say to Ibn Sayyida, even if he has... servants indicating abundance and horses / You are nothing but like the mule, for her mother... is Known (Ma'luma - Mare) and she has an Unknown (Majhul - Donkey) father.' Regarding Poetic Thefts. He said in the thirtieth type, regarding Poetic Thefts, after citing the verse of Ibn al-Khayyat: 'I am jealous if I sense a groan in the tribe... fearing for him that it might be for his love.' And the verse of 'Umara: 'Does the House (Kaaba) know that after leaving it... I did not travel from a sanctuary (Haram) except to a sanctuary.' That these two are stolen from the saying of Al-Mutanabbi: 'If I said to the lovesick sick one: May I be his ransom... because of what he suffers, it would tempt him with his ransom.' And from the saying of Abu Tammam praising some Caliphs when he performed Hajj: 'O one who saw a sanctuary striving to a sanctuary... Blessed is a toucher (of the Black Stone) coming and embracing.' He began criticizing the people of Syria and Egypt for the fact that the likes of this was hidden from them, and increased in wonder. I say: The reason for the concealment of the theft in these two verses and others is that the original is often weak, unused, not circulating on tongues in correspondences, dialogues, and proverbs. So some poet comes to that obscure meaning, highlights it in a beautiful image, and casts it in a mold more graceful and delicate than the first. So it becomes sweet and pleasant, people circulate it, and the first returns to being forgotten as if it never was. Just as when the star appears, then the full moon appears after it, the sight does not busy itself with the star and leave the full moon. How beautiful is the saying of Abu Tammam: 'Is the sun at your place boasting of its beauties... while you are busy in the entrails with the moon?' No attention is paid in the second except to its beauty without searching for its origin, and whether it is stolen or invented. Moreover, the literati, no matter how great his transmission and knowledge, cannot extract every meaning he passes by without deliberation and tracking of that. Especially in what became sweet and palatable, and appeared in an image other than its first image. There is no doubt that the saying of Ibn al-Khayyat is sweeter than the saying of Al-Mutanabbi, and for this reason it became famous. Likewise, the saying of 'Umara is better and thinner than the saying of Abu Tammam, and for this reason it became palatable and famous, and was used as a proverb despite his later time and the earlier time of Abu Tammam. Especially the second hemistich of 'Umara's verse, for it spread and diffused, and filled mouths and ears.

As for jealousy, among the most eloquent of what came in that is the saying of Ibn Qalaqis in verses: 'And my tribulation is from a secluded woman... before whom are a wall and fences / And lions whose power is feared by... everything possessed by Khaffan (lion's den) / And a watcher who, if he glances at her... bends while he is jealous.' And the saying of Ali ibn Abdullah al-Ja'fari: 'Perhaps your turning away from me pleased me... in my seeking you and your refusal of me / Fearing that I be a key for another... and when I am alone, you are the wish.' Hafsa al-Maghribiyya exaggerated in her saying: 'I am jealous for you from others and from myself... and from you and from your place and time / Even if I hid you in my eyelids... until the Day of Resurrection, it would not suffice me.' Jamal al-Din ibn Matruh took some of this and said: 'So if he persists in my destruction... I say: My torturer, by Allah increase me / And do not grant me your connection, for I... am jealous for you from myself, so how about from me (others)?' From it is the saying of Sa'd al-Din Muhammad ibn Arabi: 'O one for whom I am jealous from myself in passion... So I turn away from him while my heart is yearning / Protect the beauty of your face from my glances, for I have... a heart that sees, and for my eye is lowering (gaze).' How beautiful is the saying of Shihab al-Din ibn al-Khaymi: 'And a blamer who made me doubt his advice... whenever I increased in passion, he increased in persistence / My blamer is never but a lover... who covered jealousy with blame and darkened.' I organized (verse) regarding the meaning of Ibn al-Khaymi's saying: 'My blamer became cunning in love and his... intentions were not hidden from a lover like me / He loved my beloved then became jealous, so he feared that... I would open the subject of him, so he raced with blame.' However, Al-Mutanabbi, in the origin, took the meaning from Al-Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf where he says: 'I did not meet one with sorrow revealing his love... except I thought you were that beloved / Out of caution for you, even though I am confident in you... that other than me will not attain a share of you.' Among jealousy is the saying of Abu Tammam al-Ta'i: 'I am jealous for you from my kiss... even if you gave me my hope / And I fear to see your cheeks... set up as sites for kisses.' Among jealousy is the saying of the sayer: 'Passion became pure for you and my love selected you... until I am jealous for you from your two angels / And I see you strutting in your beauties which... are my ordeal, so I am jealous for you from you / If I could, I would wound your pronunciation out of jealousy... because I see it kissing your lips.' How delicate is the saying of Abdul Muhsin al-Suri, for he reversed the intent when he said: 'I became attached to him drunk from the wine of youth... in him is negligence of my anguish and flame / Every slender one shares with me in his love... sharing with me a portion of my soul / So do not bind me with jealousy I have not accustomed to... for my beloved is whoever loves my beloved.' Economy in Wording. He said: Bashar ibn Burd said: 'Whoever watches people does not win his need... and the bold one, fond (of it), wins the good things.' Salm al-Khasir took it, and he was his student, so he said: 'Whoever watches people dies of grief... and the daring one wins the pleasure.' There are two words difference in composition between the two verses... I say: Salm al-Khasir was not fair, and it is not said in this: there are two words difference in composition, since a 'word' (lafza) applies to two letters, like: Min, An, Ma... and others. Rather, even to one letter like the Ba of genitive and Lam. The better way in this is to say: Between them are nine letters. For the first is forty-four letters, and the second is thirty-five letters. Likewise the saying of Abu al-Atahiya: 'And I am indeed excused for the excess of loving her... because she has a face that indicates my excuse.' Abu Tammam took it and said: 'She has a face, if you see... it, it whispers to you my excuse.' The first is forty-four letters, and the second is twenty-six letters, so between them are eighteen letters. Salm al-Khasir is among those who have the ability to abbreviate. Do you not see his saying: 'They approached in the height of the forenoon... covering the face of the sun with the sun.' And the saying of the other: 'And when the gazelle (sun) appeared in the sky... and the day began to depart for its time / She showed to the eye of the sun an eye like it... meeting the sky with the like of what it welcomes.' And likewise his saying also:\n\n'It brought out its son from the liver (Kabid - also handle) of the bow, so it began... to moan, and the mother may be affectionate to the child / And it did not know that when it threw him... he did not travel from a liver except to a liver.'

I say: My torturer, by Allah increase me / And do not grant me your connection, for I... am jealous for you from myself, so how about from me (others)?' From it is the saying of Sa'd al-Din Muhammad ibn Arabi: 'O one for whom I am jealous from myself in passion... So I turn away from him while my heart is yearning / Protect the beauty of your face from my glances, for I have... a heart that sees, and for my eye is lowering (gaze).' How beautiful is the saying of Shihab al-Din ibn al-Khaymi: 'And a blamer who made me doubt his advice... whenever I increased in passion, he increased in persistence / My blamer is never but a lover... who covered jealousy with blame and darkened.' I organized (verse) regarding the meaning of Ibn al-Khaymi's saying: 'My blamer became cunning in love and his... intentions were not hidden from a lover like me / He loved my beloved then became jealous, so he feared that... I would open the subject of him, so he raced with blame.' However, Al-Mutanabbi, in the origin, took the meaning from Al-Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf where he says: 'I did not meet one with sorrow revealing his love... except I thought you were that beloved / Out of caution for you, even though I am confident in you... that other than me will not attain a share of you.' Among jealousy is the saying of Abu Tammam al-Ta'i: 'I am jealous for you from my kiss... even if you gave me my hope / And I fear to see your cheeks... set up as sites for kisses.' Among jealousy is the saying of the sayer: 'Passion became pure for you and my love selected you... until I am jealous for you from your two angels / And I see you strutting in your beauties which... are my ordeal, so I am jealous for you from you / If I could, I would wound your pronunciation out of jealousy... because I see it kissing your lips.' How delicate is the saying of Abdul Muhsin al-Suri, for he reversed the intent when he said: 'I became attached to him drunk from the wine of youth... in him is negligence of my anguish and flame / Every slender one shares with me in his love... sharing with me a portion of my soul / So do not bind me with jealousy I have not accustomed to... for my beloved is whoever loves my beloved.' Economy in Wording. He said: Bashar ibn Burd said: 'Whoever watches people does not win his need... and the bold one, fond (of it), wins the good things.' Salm al-Khasir took it, and he was his student, so he said: 'Whoever watches people dies of grief... and the daring one wins the pleasure.' There are two words difference in composition between the two verses... I say: Salm al-Khasir was not fair, and it is not said in this: there are two words difference in composition, since a 'word' (lafza) applies to two letters, like: Min, An, Ma... and others. Rather, even to one letter like the Ba of genitive and Lam. The better way in this is to say: Between them are nine letters. For the first is forty-four letters, and the second is thirty-five letters. Likewise the saying of Abu al-Atahiya: 'And I am indeed excused for the excess of loving her... because she has a face that indicates my excuse.' Abu Tammam took it and said: 'She has a face, if you see... it, it whispers to you my excuse.' The first is forty-four letters, and the second is twenty-six letters, so between them are eighteen letters. Salm al-Khasir is among those who have the ability to abbreviate. Do you not see his saying: 'They approached in the height of the forenoon... covering the face of the sun with the sun.' And the saying of the other: 'And when the gazelle (sun) appeared in the sky... and the day began to depart for its time / She showed to the eye of the sun an eye like it... meeting the sky with the like of what it welcomes.' And likewise his saying also:",

    "text": "'She watered me passion with her eyes and I watered her... so the creeping of wine crept in every joint.' And the saying of Ubaydullah, one of the Hamasah poets: 'You split the heart then sprinkled your love... in it, so it closed up and the cracks healed / It penetrated where no drink reached... nor sadness, and no joy reached.' He said: On this came the saying of Ibn al-Rumi: 'As if I seek nearness to you with the son of a bow (arrow)... when pulling brings it near the chest, it distances it.' Some poets of the Levant took it, namely Ibn Qasim al-Hamawi, and said: 'So he is like the arrow, the more you increase him... in nearness by pulling, the more he increases in distance.' I say: Al-Arjani also took it and said: 'So do not deny the right of the yearning one, for we... for us and for you the stars of the night testify / I see us as arrows in passion and see you... as bows, so you do not come near except to distance.' And he repeated it saying: 'The figure bent in farewell and brought me near... as an arrow, then distanced me from where it brought me near.' And he repeated it also saying: 'Like the arrow, its shooter brings it near... and for the sake of distance is that nearness.' And he said: 'The day of departure did not embrace me out of passion... rather it was bringing me near to distance me.' And he said: 'And the intimate friend embraced me for separation... so my cheeks and his cheeks wrapped / As if he aimed at a goal... taking the arrow with his right hand / Until when he brought it near his chest... he distanced it the hour he brought it near.' Kushajim took it before Al-Arjani and said: 'I see your connection does not clear up for the one hoping for it... and abandonment follows it running on the trail / Like the bow, the nearest of its two arrows to which you bent... upon, is the furthest of them from the pull of the string.' Ibn Babak generated another meaning from this, saying: 'I became in his polo stick a ball... its nearness to the striker distances it.' How beautiful is the saying of Ibn al-Mughallis riddling about it: 'He wanted its nearness, until when... it came near him with toil—what toil—he hated it / Then he followed it with a strike... and exchanged its nearness to him with distance.' Between Prose and Poetry. He said regarding preferring prose over poetry at the end of the book: 'If a poet wants to explain multiple matters, having different meanings in his poetry, and needs to prolong by composing two hundred or three hundred verses or more than that, he does not do well in all of it nor in much of it; rather, he does well in a small part, and much of it is bad and unsatisfactory. The writer (prose) is not afflicted by that; rather, he prolongs in a single letter a vast prolongation reaching ten layers of paper or more, containing three hundred lines or four hundred or five hundred. And he is excellent in all of that. There is no dispute in this, because we have seen it and said it. Based on this, I found the Persians superior to the Arabs in this point referred to. For their poet mentions a book composed from its beginning to its end in poetry, which is an explanation of stories and conditions, yet it is in the utmost eloquence and rhetoric in the language of the people, as Firdawsi did in composing the book known as Shahnameh, which is sixty thousand verses of poetry, comprising the history of the Persians. It is the Quran of the people. Their eloquent ones have agreed that there is nothing in their language more eloquent than it. This is not found in the Arabic language despite its vastness and the branching of its arts and purposes, and despite the fact that the language of the Arabs compared to it is like a drop in a sea.' I say: Ibn al-Athir, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, ended his book with this point in which he leaned towards Shu'ubiyyah (anti-Arab sentiment). Ma'mar ibn al-Muthanna, Sahl ibn Harun, and Ibn Gharsiya in his epistle did not say the like of this. Among the people of the Arabic tongue, there have been found those who organized much as well. If he counts Firdawsi, I count for him a group like that. Among them are those who versified the history of Al-Masudi in a versification of utmost beauty. And among them are those who versified the book Kalila wa Dimna in ten thousand verses; Aban al-Lahiqi also versified it. The Sheikh, Imam, Hafiz Shams al-Din Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Dhahabi informed me that Makki ibn Abi Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Abihi al-Dimashqi, known as Ibn al-Dajjajiyya, versified the book Al-Muhadhdhab in a poem on the rhyme of Ra, calling it 'Al-Badi'a fi Ahkam al-Shari'a'.

    "text": "Some Maghrebis praised our Master the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, in a poem numbering eighteen thousand verses. Ibn al-Habbariya has the book 'Al-Sadih wa al-Baghim' in two thousand verses; each verse is a lofty palace, and its witticisms have no increase in beauty upon them. It comprises tales, anecdotes, proverbs, and wisdoms, all in the utmost eloquence and rhetoric, having no 'if' or 'would that' (flaws). As for those who versified a thousand or less, they are very many, uncountable. As for Al-Shatibiyya and what it contains of knowing the seven readings and their differences, and those symbols whose exterior is ghazal and interior is knowledge, it is a book that became famous and appeared, and its magic snatched minds and dazzled, until the sayer said about it: 'Al-Ru'ayni unveiled to us in the forenoon... his virgin bride, and oh what he unveiled / If another innovator sought her... her rhymes would say to him, all of them: No.' As for the Rajaz poems of grammar, prosody, and Fiqh, like the one who versified Al-Wajiz and the system of the Hanafis, and other than that of medicine and other sciences, they are very many, to the extent that description cannot encompass. We have not heard of any Persian who busied himself with Arabic except that he preferred the Arabic language. The proof of this claim is that Abu Ali al-Farisi, Bundar, Abu Hatim, Al-Zamakhshari, and others of these, when they busied themselves with Arabic and tasted its sweetness, they fell in love with it and became fond of its beauties. They spent nights and days acquiring it, and spent the duration of life in composing and recording it, and tracking its beauties, the rules of its analogies, and the wonders of its arts. It is impossible that these people strove this striving in Arabic and spent the duration of life while it is something that does not succeed in anything, being inferior to another. It would have been more appropriate for them and for every rational person to busy themselves with the best, most eloquent, most rhetorical, and most wise. If these people knew that the Persian language had the superlative (Af'al al-Tafdil), they would not have stopped at Arabic except long enough to know it, then turned back to their language. Among the genius words of Al-Zamakhshari: 'Your differentiating between Rutab (fresh dates) and Ajam (seeds) is a difference between Arabs and Ajam (Non-Arabs).' And among them: 'The Arabs are a hard Nab' tree of dictionaries (Ma'ajim), and the Gharb (willow/West) is a likeness for the A'ajim (Non-Arabs).' Look at Al-Zamakhshari how he made the Arabs Rutab (fresh/good) and the Ajam (Persians) Ajam (seeds/hard/speechless). Ajam with the movement of Jim is the date pit. And how he made the Arabs like the Nab' tree, which is hard and from which bows are made, and made the Ajam like the Gharb tree, which is weak. Al-Mutanabbi said: 'Let not the nights attain you, for their hands... if they strike, break the Nab' with the Gharb.' If you say: The scholars of Arabic among the Persians were not knowledgeable in the Persian language as they should be, I say: Is it not that they knew Persian, then they became skilled in Arabic and exaggerated in mastering it? Whoever reaches in a language of languages what Abu Ali and Al-Zamakhshari and others reached in knowing the major and minor derivation, structures, and morphology, in the noun, past verb, present verb, imperative, active participle, and passive participle, and possessed that faculty, had the qualification to look into every language whose tongue he knew, and to extract its rules and follow its principles, thus falling upon the wonders of its wisdom and beauties of its rules, due to the entanglement of sciences with each other, and the gathering of their union in the goal that necessitated their establishment. Only a wise man establishes language. Do you not see that some grammarians arranged the Turkish language according to grammatical rules, and distinguished the noun from the verb, the past from the present from the imperative, the pronoun of the speaker from the addressee from the absent, the plural from the singular, the sign of the plural, and the possessive from the possessed, and so on? This is a matter not hidden. As for his saying: The book Shahnameh is sixty thousand verses, all in the utmost beauty of eloquence and rhetoric, and there is nothing in it to be criticized; this claim is not heard stripped of the proof that supports it. Who can bring sixty thousand words, or six thousand words, that are in the utmost eloquence in wording and rhetoric in meaning such that they cannot be criticized in any way?! This is not in human power in any language. We grant that it is not criticized in that language, but from where do you get that the good poetry of the Persians is in the class of the quality of Arab poetry? As you say: The moon is more luminous than the stars, and the sun is more luminous than the stars. The sun and the moon shared in the virtue over the stars, but in themselves they are not equal, for example.

Are they equal, for example, in quality as such: 'Do you not see that the sword decreases in value... if you say that the sword is sharper than the stick?' The good in poetry is only rare because the eloquent ones and scholars of literature selected the high good which is the summit in eloquence and rhetoric, and made it a model and example to follow, according to what they decided by the power of their thought and correctness of their criticism. So that good was in the highest class. No doubt the fallen (low quality) of poetry is more than the high according to the Imams of rhetoric; otherwise, in reality, what the masters of rhetoric count as fallen poetry is good according to others, not defective, except what is fallen to the extreme. This point is the cause of the scarcity of good poetry. From where is there in the poetry of Persians what is in the poetry of Arabs of Majaz (metaphor), Isti'ara (metaphor), Kinaya (metonymy), Tashbih (simile), Tawriya (double entendre), Istikhdam (usage), and Jinas (paronomasia), with the difference of every type of these types and the branching of its sections? To other types of Badi' (rhetorical embellishments) which approach one hundred types. Far from it! Between them is the form of the superlative (Af'al - i.e., great difference). Al-Husri mentioned in 'Zahr al-Adab' that a Bedouin said to a poet from the Persians: 'Poetry belongs to the Arabs, and whoever among you speaks poetry, then a man of us leaped upon his mother.' End. Ibn Khalaf was fair in his saying: 'The Arabs have a Tent (Bayt - also verse) and a Diwan (Collection/Council), and the Persians have a Palace and an Iwan.' As for his claim that the poet does not do well in the majority (of long works), the excuse for that is apparent. Because he is in two severe straits to the extreme. They are: Meter (Wazn), and the necessity of a single Rhyme (Rawi). The prose writer is not compelled to either of them; rather, he is left to himself. If he wishes, he brings two rhymed phrases on one letter, and if he wishes on more. If he wishes, he brings the rhyme on twenty words, or less down to two words. If the writer brought a long letter on one letter in his rhyme, and a specific number of rhyme words, his condition would be the condition of the poet; rather, his speech would be uglier and heavier on ears and hearts, because poetry is promoted by meter, unlike prose. Therefore, this is not fit to be a virtue of prose over poetry. 'And how, when poetry still has water (luster)... over which the basil of hearts flutters.' Let this be the end of what I wanted to say regarding 'Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir'. I have forgiven him in much where his slip is apparent. Although I do not deny the excellence he has in it, and the witticisms that are a pupil for the eye of this art. For he did not spare effort in the instruction he gave, nor fall short in the education he provided. He alerted to the notches of this art, and pointed to hunting what strayed from it and what appeared. If a writer or poet happens to review 'Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir', 'Al-Falak al-Da'ir', and these papers, there is no doubt that this will benefit him with abundant benefits, alert him to sources of error so he avoids them, and awaken him to sites of beauty so he seeks them. 'And I have gifted it to you, and it is to me... over the days, among the purest gifts.' Praise be to Allah first and last, and blessings upon our Master Muhammad and his family and companions, the good and pure, and peace.\n\nIs the good of the Persians like the good of the Arabs?

Therefore, this is not fit to be a virtue of prose over poetry. 'And how, when poetry still has water (luster)... over which the basil of hearts flutters.' Let this be the end of what I wanted to say regarding 'Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir'. I have forgiven him in much where his slip is apparent. Although I do not deny the excellence he has in it, and the witticisms that are a pupil for the eye of this art. For he did not spare effort in the instruction he gave, nor fall short in the education he provided. He alerted to the notches of this art, and pointed to hunting what strayed from it and what appeared. If a writer or poet happens to review 'Al-Mathal Al-Sa'ir', 'Al-Falak al-Da'ir', and these papers, there is no doubt that this will benefit him with abundant benefits, alert him to sources of error so he avoids them, and awaken him to sites of beauty so he seeks them. 'And I have gifted it to you, and it is to me... over the days, among the purest gifts.' Praise be to Allah first and last, and blessings upon our Master Muhammad and his family and companions, the good and pure, and peace.",
