Publisher's Introduction. Praise be to Allah alone, and peace and blessings be upon him after whom there is no Prophet, and upon his family and companions. To proceed: This is the book \"Al-Thamar al-Mustatab fi Fiqh al-Sunnah wal-Kitab\" by the virtuous Imam, the Muhaddith, Sheikh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani - may Allah have mercy on him and dwell him in His vast Gardens. It comes out to its readers and lovers to see the light after decades passed while it was locked in the Sheikh's library, may Allah have mercy on him. The drafting of this book was completed in the year (1366 AH) - as we found it on the book's cover in the author's handwriting. This act by the Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, is nothing but a practical lesson for those pseudo-scholars whom we have seen selling books to publishers that have not even been written yet; rather, they are merely an idea. Once they receive the known payment, they start gathering from here and there, collecting and inflating, until the cover becomes a volume and the volume becomes volumes, then after that, they appear with the appearance of verifiers and commentators and... so on of glittering, shiny words. And there is no power nor strength except by Allah. What appears to us is that our Sheikh, the Imam, did not finish this book, and that he reached where he reached in it before the year (1370 AH); as indicated by his opinion on the Palestinian refugees dwelling in mosques during the days of the Nakba (1948 AD), so refer to (p. 820) of this book. Thus; we do not need to introduce the merits and characteristics of this book; as they are clear to every reader - Allah willing -; except that we find ourselves compelled to mention some of those merits, so we say: The most important of them:",

Likewise, you see him retracting the authentication or weakening of some Hadiths; as in the Hadith: \"Whoever preserves the prayer...\" coming in (p. 52), so compare it with \"Da'if al-Targhib\" (No. 312) and others. And that is a virtue that only one who fears Allah the Almighty in what he writes approaches, and does not care about people's talk; for the change of Ijtihad - for the known reasons",

We must not miss pointing out that this book, in its beginnings, consisted of bullet points for issues recorded by the Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him; as a reminder for himself of what he would address in his jurisprudential lessons for the youth in Syria in the past; therefore, we find him mentioning the edge of the issue, then the edges of the evidences or what points to them. Then it appeared to the Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, to elaborate and author a book reviewing the issues with mention of their evidences from the Quran and the authentic Sunnah; therefore, we find him, may Allah have mercy on him, in the early parts of the book - and within the limit of some ten pages - mentioning the sources of extraction as symbols without mentioning the volume and page. Then after that, he began mentioning some chains of narration and discussing them, reducing the symbols and replacing them with names while mentioning the volume and page for those sources; except very rarely. And to facilitate for the reader, we mention here the meanings of those symbols used, and here they are: Symbol = Meaning ... Symbol = Meaning Kh = Al-Bukhari ... Ya'la = Abu Ya'la M = Muslim ...

So we were keen to bring it out in the best attire, and we checked the printed version against the Sheikh's original, and we made it into two volumes; the first volume ends with (p. 514), and the second volume begins with (p. 515) and ends with (p. 851). We created various scientific indexes for it; to facilitate reference and to complete the benefit. Among them were an index of Hadiths and Athar (narrations) mentioned in the book, an index of men discussed regarding criticism and praise (Jarh wa Ta'dil), an index of strange words, and an index of topics and benefits. So we ask Allah the Almighty to benefit all Muslims with it, and to place it in the balance of our Sheikh's good deeds, and to write for us the reward of cooperation in righteousness and piety. And may Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his companions and grant them peace. 5 / Jumada al-Ula / 1422 AH The Publisher",

From Jabir: The Messenger of Allah came to visit me while I was sick and unconscious, so he performed ablution and poured his ablution water over me, and I regained consciousness (Darimi: 1/187) (Agreed upon). And in the Hadith of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, did not expectorate spittle except that it fell into the palm of a man, who would rub his face and skin with it. And when he performed ablution, they would almost fight over his ablution water (Kh Ham). And similar meaning from a group. Hadith of Hudhayfah: (Indeed, the Muslim does not become impure) (Kh M). And in it: That he used to bathe with the leftover water of Maimunah. (M). Ibn Abbas: One of the wives of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, bathed in a large bowl, so the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, wanted to perform ablution from it. She said: O Messenger of Allah, I was Junub (ritually impure). He said: (Indeed, water does not become Junub). Authentic. Chosen by Ibn Taymiyyah (3) in (Al-Ikhtiyarat) and in (Majmu' al-Rasa'il) (2/217) (Ham D N T: Sahih - Maj Mas Qat Khaz). And the prohibition of it is for dislike (Tanzih).

And this was chosen by Ibn Taymiyyah (3) and in (Majmu' al-Rasa'il) (2/217). 2 - Leftover water of animals: If a dog licks, spill it. The cat: It is not impure. 3 - Purifying Impurities: Feces. Urine of a human. Dung of horses, mules, and donkeys. Blood and Madhy (pre-seminal fluid). Purification is mostly by water. For purifying blood and what resembles it, Asma bint Abi Bakr said: A woman came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: One of us gets menstrual blood on her garment, what should she do? He said: (Scrape it, then rub it with water, then wash/sprinkle it, then pray in it) (Agreed upon). And the impure earth is purified by pouring abundant water over it as in the Hadith of the Bedouin, and by the sun and wind if no trace of impurity remains, and this is the choice of the Sheikh (11). And the vessel which a dog has licked is purified by washing it with water seven times and rubbing it once with dust. And what is affected by Madhy and the urine of a nursing boy is purified by sprinkling and spraying, and the first is the choice of the Sheikh (15) excluding the urine of the girl.

It is interpreted by the Sunnah according to the recitation of Khafd (genitive case), so the intent is wiping over the Khuffs, and Ibn Taymiyyah inclined to this in (Al-Ikhtiyarat) (8).

He set the time for the resident as one day and night, and for the traveler as three days and their nights, if he purified himself and then put on his Khuffs, as in the Hadith of Abu Bakrah in Al-Daraqutni (71) with a Hasan chain. The period of wiping starts from the time he wipes until the same time the next day, which is the opinion of Ahmad as in (Masa'il Abi Dawood) (10). The period of wiping is not timed for the traveler for whom engaging in removing and wearing is difficult, such as the courier dispatched in the interest of Muslims, and the story of Uqbah bin Amir is interpreted upon this. Sheikh al-Islam said this in his (Ikhtiyarat) (9). The story referred to is what Al-Daraqutni narrated (72) via Ali bin Rabah from Uqbah who said: I went from Sham to Medina on Friday, entered Medina on Friday, and entered upon Umar bin Al-Khattab - added in a narration: wearing two Khuffs from those thick Khuffs - so he said: When did you put your Khuffs on your feet? I said: On Friday. He said: Did you take them off? I said: No. He said: You hit the Sunnah. Al-Daraqutni said: It has an authentic chain. Sheikh al-Islam said in (Al-Fatawa) (1/259): And it is an authentic Hadith. It is as they said. See the detail in (Al-Fatawa) also (2/188-189). I say: The Hadith was narrated in (Al-Mukhtara) (1/93) with this wording. And in a narration: (You hit) without (the Sunnah), he said: It is the preserved one.

One should not seek to wear them just to wipe over them. He, peace and blessings be upon him, used to wash his feet if they were uncovered and wipe if he was wearing Khuffs. Sheikh al-Islam in (Al-Ikhtiyarat) (8). Then he said: (9): The ablution of the one wiping over the Khuff and the turban is not broken by removing them nor by the expiration of the period, and this was said by Ibn Hazm (2/80-84 and 97). Nor is he obliged to wipe his head or wash his feet, and it is the school of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ibrahim Al-Nakha'i, Ibn Abi Layla, and Dawud as in (Al-Muhalla) (2/94), like removing the hair that was wiped over, according to the correct view of Ahmad's school and the opinion of the majority. Al-Tahawi narrated (1/58) from Shu'bah from Salamah bin Kuhail from Zabyan that he saw Ali perform ablution and wipe over his sandals then enter the mosque, take off his sandals, then pray.

It is established from him, peace and blessings be upon him, that he wiped over the socks, and it is an authentic Hadith; whoever faults it has no proof. Abu Dawood said after narrating it: This was also narrated from Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he wiped over the socks, but it is neither connected nor strong. Al-Tahawi narrated it (1/58). Abu Dawood said: Ali bin Abi Talib, Abu Mas'ud, Al-Bara' bin Azib, Anas bin Malik, Abu Umamah, Sahl bin Sa'd, and Amr bin Hurayth wiped over the socks.

It is not a condition that they be leather-soled nor that they stay up by themselves; therefore, Ahmad stated that it is permissible to wipe over socks even if they do not stay up by themselves; rather, if they are held up by sandals, it is permissible to wipe over them, as Sheikh al-Islam transmitted in (Al-Fatawa) (1/262). Based on this, it is permissible to wipe over thin socks if they are fastened with an elastic band as is used today. Ibn Hazm stated explicitly (2/81) the permissibility of that even if it is of silk for a woman specifically. It is also established that he, peace and blessings be upon him, used to wipe over sandals (Na'layn). Abu Dawood narrated it from the Hadith of Al-Mughirah, then Ahmad narrated it (4/9 and 10) from the Hadith of Aws bin Abi Aws, and likewise Al-Tabarani in (Al-Kabir), both via Hammad bin Salamah and Sharik, both from Ya'la bin Ata from Aws bin Abi Aws who said: I saw my father one day perform ablution and wipe over the sandals. I said: Do you wipe over them? He said: Thus I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, do. This is an authentic chain.

Ahmad narrated it (4/8) via this way without his saying: 'and wiped over his sandals and feet.' The first narration is more authentic to me due to the agreement of two trustworthy narrators on it: Hammad and Sharik, while their opponent - Hushaym - engages in much Tadlis (concealing defects in the chain) as in Al-Taqrib, and he used 'An' (from) in it. Ahmad (1/148) and Al-Darimi (1/181) narrated it from the Hadith of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, who said - and the context belongs to the first -: Abu Nu'aym told us: Yunus told us from Abu Ishaq from Abd Khayr who said: I saw Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, perform ablution and wipe over the sandals, then he said: Were it not that I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, do as you saw me do, I would have thought that the bottom of the feet was more deserving of wiping than their top. This is an authentic chain. Al-A'mash followed him from Abu Ishaq with the wording: I used to think that the bottom of the feet was more deserving of wiping than their top until I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, wiping their top. Narrated by Ahmad (1/114, 124). It seems some narrators abbreviated the mention of the sandals from it, so it is interpreted as wiping over the sandals based on the evidence of the first narration. Likewise, Al-Suddi narrated it from Abd Khayr similarly, and in it: And he wiped over his sandals then said: Thus is the ablution of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, for the pure one as long as he does not have Hadith (impurity).",

However, Ahmad also narrated it (1/116) via Sharik from Al-Suddi with it with the wording: And he wiped over the top of his feet then said: This is the ablution of one who has not had Hadith. Then he said: Were it not that I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, wipe over the top of his feet, I would have thought that their bottoms were more deserving. It is said regarding this what we said about the narration from Abu Ishaq, especially since Sharik has poor memory, so the narration of Sufyan from Al-Suddi is more authentic. Moreover, Ibn Abd Khayr followed him from his father with the wording: So he washed the tops of his feet and said: Were it not that I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, washing the tops of his feet, I would have thought that their bottoms were more deserving of washing. Narrated by Ahmad also (1/124) via Ishaq bin Ismail: Sufyan told us from Abu Al-Sawda' from Ibn Abd Khayr. Then he said: Ishaq told us: Sufyan told us once again saying: I saw Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, perform ablution and wipe over their tops. This is an authentic chain. Abu Al-Sawda's name is Amr bin Imran and Ibn Abd Khayr's name is Al-Musayyib; both are trustworthy.

It says in (Al-Nihayah): Wiping can be wiping with the hand or washing. The chain of this narration is authentic on the condition of Al-Bukhari. This, and the Hadith of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, regarding wiping over the sandals was also narrated by Ibn Khuzaimah and Ahmad bin Ubaid Al-Saffar as in (Nayl Al-Awtar) (1/158). In the chapter, there is [a report] from Ibn Abbas in Ibn Hibban and Al-Bayhaqi as in (Al-Ikhtiyarat) by Sheikh al-Islam (8), and from Anas in Al-Bayhaqi.

This Humyan, I did not find anyone who mentioned him, while the rest of its narrators are trustworthy. Wiping over them is established from Ibn Mas'ud and from Amr bin Hurayth. Al-Tabarani narrated both in (Al-Kabir); the chain of the first has narrators who are deemed trustworthy, and the other has trustworthy narrators as in (Al-Majma'). Al-Awza'i held the permissibility of wiping over them, as did Ibn Hazm in (Al-Muhalla) (2/103). So the statement of Sheikh al-Islam in (Al-Fatawa) (1/266) that (It is not permissible to wipe over them by the agreement of Muslims) is refuted by what we mentioned.

And an intermediate state, which is in the sandal; it is neither permissible to wipe nor is it exposed to necessitate washing, so it was given an intermediate state which is sprinkling. Where the term 'wiping' is applied to it in this state, the intent is sprinkling. Sprinkling over sandals and wiping over them has been reported in (Al-Musnad) from the Hadith of Aws bin Abi Aws. And Ibn Hibban and Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the Hadith of Ibn Abbas). Thus in (Al-Ikhtiyarat) (8). Yet there is no mention of sprinkling in any of these Hadiths, neither in the Musnad nor elsewhere from the Hadith of Aws bin Abi Aws nor from the Hadith of others. Unless it is in another Hadith from Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: O Ibn Abbas, shall I not perform for you the ablution of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him? I said: Yes - may my father and mother be your ransom. He said: So a vessel was placed for him, he washed his hands, then rinsed his mouth, sniffed water, and blew it out. Then he took water with his hands and splashed his face with them, inserting his thumbs into the front of his ears. He said: Then he repeated that three times. Then he took a handful of water with his right hand and poured it on his forehead, letting it run down his face. Then he washed his right hand to the elbow three times, then his other hand likewise. Then he wiped his head and ears from their backs. Then he took water with his palms and splashed it on his feet while they were in the sandal, then he turned it (the foot/sandal) with it, then on the other foot likewise. He said: So I said: And in the sandals? He said: And in the sandals. I said: And in the sandals? He said: And in the sandals. I said: And in the sandals? He said: And in the sandals.

This Hadith is almost a text for what Sheikh al-Islam, may Allah have mercy on him, adopted regarding sprinkling the foot while it is in the sandal. However, it does not necessitate invalidating the other Sunnah which is wiping over the sandals like the Khuffs and socks, by interpreting wiping over them as sprinkling as the Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, said, due to the absence of a definitive diverting context from the literal to the metaphorical. And Allah knows best. Then I found a text by Sheikh al-Islam in which he adopted wiping over sandals on the condition of difficulty in removing them. He said in (Al-Fatawa) (2/85): Wiping over the feet has been transmitted from him, peace and blessings be upon him, in the place of need, such as having on his feet sandals that are difficult to remove.

Circumcision: If he sits between her four parts and the circumcised part touches the circumcised part, then Ghusl becomes obligatory. (Ham M T: Sahih) even if he does not ejaculate (M Ham). The ruling in the beginning of Islam was: (Water is from water) (M), then it was abrogated. This is supported by His saying, the Almighty: (And if you are Junub, then purify yourselves) [Al-Ma'idah 6]. For the speech of the Arabs implies that Janabah applies in reality to intercourse even if there is no ejaculation, as Al-Shafi'i said. 4 - Menstruation (Hayd). (If the menses comes, leave the prayer, and if it goes, then bathe and pray) (Kh M). 5 - Post-Partum Bleeding (Nifas). Consensus has occurred among scholars that Nifas is like Hayd in all that is permissible, prohibited, disliked, and recommended. 14 - Obligatory Ghusls. 1 - Ghusl for the Disbeliever who embraces Islam.

Al-Tahawi narrated (1/324) from Ali bin Salih and Bishr bin Al-Walid together from Abu Yusuf who said: I arrived in Medina and one whom I trust brought out a Sa' to me saying: This is the Sa' of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. So I measured it and found it to be five Ratls and a third. Al-Tahawi said: I heard Ibn Abi Imran say: It is said that the one who brought this out to Abu Yusuf is Malik bin Anas. The Sa' is four Mudds, and the Mudd is the fill of the palms of a moderate man if he fills them and extends his hands with them. It is named Mudd thereby. I have tested that and found it correct. It is said in (Al-Qamus). It equals (700) grams in the estimation of Sheikh Bahjat Al-Bitar, may Allah the Almighty preserve him. He sometimes performed ablution with less than that, performing ablution once in a vessel containing water amount to two-thirds of a Mudd (D: 15) Sahih. What is obtained from the sum of Hadiths and texts is that (The sufficient amount for Ghusl is what achieves wetting the body in the considered manner, whether it is a Sa' or less or more, as long as it does not reach in decrease to an amount where its user is not called a bather, or to an amount in increase where its doer enters the limit of extravagance. And likewise Ablution, the sufficient amount of it is what achieves washing the limbs of ablution, whether it is a Mudd or less or more, as long as it does not reach in increase to the limit of extravagance or in decrease to a limit where the obligatory is not achieved). Thus in (Al-Nayl) (1/219-220). And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (Indeed there will be in this nation a people who transgress in purification and supplication) (D: 15).

But if he finds water, let him make it touch his skin, for that is better) (D T: Sahih Ham from Abu Dharr).

I say: Its narrators are narrators of Al-Bukhari with the wording: (Let him fear Allah and make it touch his skin). See Al-Zayla'i (1/148-150). It is the saying of Ibn Al-Musayyib, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Al-Zuhri, Abu Ja'far Al-Baqir, and Yazid bin Harun. (Al-Muhalla) (2/128). If he finds water, he does not repeat what he prayed, and it is the school of the Four. Abu Sa'id said: Two men went out on a journey and prayer time arrived, and they had no water. They performed Tayammum with clean earth and prayed. Then they found water within the time. One of them repeated the ablution and prayer, and the other did not repeat. Then they came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and mentioned that to him. He said to the one who did not repeat: (You hit the Sunnah and your prayer sufficed you). And he said to the one who performed ablution and repeated: (You have the reward twice) (D N) and others. See (Naqd Al-Taj). Nothing invalidates it except what invalidates ablution among the nullifiers, and finding water due to the Hadith of Abu Dharr and Abu Hurairah mentioned previously, and due to his saying - in the Hadith of the one who kept away from prayer while Junub which passed recently -: And the end of that was that he, peace and blessings be upon him, gave the one who had Janabah a vessel of water and said: (Go and pour it over yourself).

Then Al-Hakim narrated it (1/174) via Suhail bin Abi Salih from Al-Zuhri from Urwah bin Al-Zubair from Asma bint Umais who said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish has had irregular bleeding since such and such time and has not prayed. She said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (Glory be to Allah, this is from Satan. Let her sit in a tub, and if she sees yellowness on top of the water, let her bathe for Zuhr and Asr with one bath, and bathe for Maghrib and Isha with one bath, and bathe for Fajr, and perform ablution in between that).

    "text": "So this Hadith indicates that yellowness is not menstrual blood due to his saying: (Menstrual blood is black and known). This is the school of Ibn Hazm and the majority of literalists as he said in (Al-Muhalla) (2/168). As for redness and yellowness after purity (Tuhr), it is not counted as anything. This is the opinion of Abu Hanifa, Sufyan Al-Thawri, Al-Awza'i, Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and others. From Aisha, wife of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that Umm Habibah bint Jahsh, the sister-in-law of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and wife of Abd al-Rahman bin Awf, had irregular bleeding for seven years, so she asked the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, for a ruling on that. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (Indeed this is not the menses, but this is a vein; so bathe and pray). Aisha said: She used to bathe in a tub in the room of her sister Zainab bint Jahsh until the redness of the blood would overcome the water. (M: 181, D 44, N: 655, Maj: 215-216, Mi: 196-198, 199 and 200) and Ham (6-83 and 187). Narrated by: M (181-182) N (65) D (43). And from Aisha that some of his wives performed I'tikaf with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, while she was Mustahada seeing blood, so perhaps she would place the basin under her for the blood. He claimed that Aisha saw safflower water and said: This was something such and such [woman] used to find. (Kh: 26, Mi: 217, and in a wording",

However, it is on the condition of Muslim because of Hammad bin Salamah, and the first is on their condition, and his rectification upon Al-Bukhari is meaningless. Al-Darimi narrated from Ibn Sirin who said: They did not see any harm in turbidity and yellowness. 1 - So if menstrual blood is black and known, then anyone who sees it and distinguishes it is menstruating (Ha'id), otherwise she is Mustahada. 2 - Except the one who cannot distinguish her blood due to its abundance and continuity, she must refer to her habit and her known days of menses. 3 - And if she does not know the days of menses and does not distinguish the blood, she must refer to the predominant habit of women in that.",

Maj (224) Qat (81) from Abd al-Rahman bin Muhammad Al-Muharibi from Salam bin Sulaim from Humaid from him. Qat said: No one narrated it from Humaid except this Salam, who is Salam Al-Tawil, and he is weak in Hadith. As for the statement of the author of (Al-Zawa'id) that its chain is authentic and its narrators are trustworthy, this is an error originating from not tracking who extracted the Hadith. Refer for that to the commentary on (Al-Muhalla) (2/206). Ibn Hazm extracted it (2) From Abdullah bin Amr, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (The woman in Nifas waits for forty nights; if she sees purity before that, she is pure. If she exceeds forty, she is like the Mustahada; she bathes and prays, and if the blood overcomes her, she performs ablution for every prayer) Qat (81) Mas (176) via Amr bin Al-Husain: Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Ulaithah told us from Abdah bin Abi Lubabah from Abdullah bin Babah from him. Qat said: Amr bin Al-Husain and Ibn Ulaithah are weak and abandoned.

He said so and Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, although he says in his biography in (Al-Mizan): (Not known), said by Ibn Al-Madini. And in (Al-Taqrib): (Unknown). Al-Shawkani said (1/247): (The evidences indicating that the maximum of Nifas is forty days support each other by the Sunnah to the level of validity and consideration, so resorting to it is obligatory. What is obligatory on the woman in Nifas is stopping for forty days unless she sees purity before that as the previous Hadiths indicated).

I say: What he mentioned about Al-Shafi'i is one opinion of his, otherwise the famous opinion mentioned in the books of his companions is that the maximum of Nifas is sixty days. Al-Tirmidhi narrated it from Ata bin Abi Rabah and Al-Sha'bi. They differed regarding the minimum of Nifas on opinions; the closest to correctness is that there is no limit for its minimum due to his saying previously: If she sees purity before that. It is the opinion of Al-Shafi'i and Muhammad, and it is the choice of Sheikh al-Islam (16) from (Al-Ikhtiyarat) and Ibn Hazm (2/203). Know that Nifas is like Hayd in all that is permissible, prohibited, disliked, and recommended, and Al-Shawkani transmitted consensus on that (248) from (Al-Bahr). They have agreed that the menstruating woman does not pray, so likewise the woman in Nifas.",

However, his Kufr is not of the type that Allah cannot forgive and admit him to Paradise; rather that is possible. He, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (Five prayers Allah has written upon the servants. Whoever comes with them and did not waste anything from them out of disdain for their right, he has a covenant with Allah that He will admit him to Paradise. And whoever does not come with them, he has no covenant with Allah; if He wills He punishes him, and if He wills He admits him to Paradise). (Malik, D, N, Mi, Maj, Ham with a Sahih chain). And know that many Hadiths have come attributing Kufr to one who commits a sin from the major sins, rather in some of them [it says] it is Kufr and that he is a Kafir (disbeliever). So he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (Abusing a Muslim is Fusuq (wickedness) and fighting him is Kufr). And he said: (There is no man who claims other than his father while knowing it except that he has disbelieved). And (Two things in people are Kufr for them: Defaming lineage and wailing over the dead). And (Do not return after me as disbelievers, striking the necks of one another). And (Any slave who runs away from his masters has disbelieved until he returns to them). And (Whoever says to his brother 'O Kafir', then one of them has incurred it; if it is as he said, otherwise it returns to him). All these Hadiths are in the (Sahih). So if we know that Kufr is degrees and that some of it does not make its doer abide eternally in the Fire, then there is no resort then to interpretation. Whoever the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, named a Kafir, we name him a Kafir, and we do not exceed this amount. Refer for this to Al-Shawkani (1/254-260).",

This is a view of Al-Shafi'i in the Old and New [schools]. A group of Shafi'is authenticated it, and Al-Nawawi chose it and supported it; so refer to his words in (Al-Majmu') (3/29-33). The Hadith of Gabriel only indicates the time of virtue and choice, just as it also indicated that specifically regarding Asr prayer. The Shafaq (twilight) is the redness, due to his saying, peace be upon him: (And the time of Maghrib is as long as the Thawr of the Shafaq has not fallen). Narrated by Muslim (2/104) in a narration from the Hadith of Ibn Amr previously mentioned. It is with Abu Dawood with the wording: Fawr of the Shafaq. It means Thawr, i.e., its rising/eruption. Al-Nawawi said in (Al-Majmu') (3/36): (This is a description of the red, not the white). Ibn Khuzaymah narrated it in his (Sahih) explicitly stating that, he said: Ammar bin Khalid told us: Muhammad bin Yazid - he is",

The Hadith. This is a good (Jayyid) chain, except that Ibn Khuzaymah said after citing it: If this wording is authentic; Muhammad bin Yazid was alone in it, while the companions of Shu'bah only said in it: 'Nur' (light) of the Shafaq instead of 'Humrah' (redness) of the Shafaq. Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Talkhis) (3/28): (I say: Muhammad bin Yazid is truthful). And he said in (Al-Taqrib): (Trustworthy, firm, worshipper). The majority of jurists and linguists held that Shafaq is redness, and it is the view of the two Companions [Abu Yusuf and Muhammad]. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it with a Sahih chain from Ibn Umar as in (Tahdhib Al-Asma') (2/165). Al-Daraqutni (100) narrated it raised [to the Prophet] and found fault with it. Then he narrated it from Ubadah bin Al-Samit and Shaddad bin Aws together, and from Abu Huraira as Mawquf (stopped at the companion). Abu Hanifa, Al-Muzani, and a group of jurists and linguists said: The intended is the white [twilight] which is after the red. It says in (Sharh Muslim): (The first is the preponderant view). And Ibn Hazm went to it (3/192-194). It is recommended to hasten to Maghrib prayer and accelerate it before the stars appear/intertwine, due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (My Ummah will not cease to be in good - or upon the Fitrah - as long as they do not delay Maghrib until the stars intertwine).

Anas said: The Mu'adhin used to call Adhan, and people from the companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, would stand rushing to the pillars until the Prophet came out while they were like that praying two Rak'ahs before Maghrib; there was nothing between the Adhan and Iqamah.

As for what Abu Dawood alone narrated (202) from the path of Shu'bah from Abu Shu'ayb from Tawus who said: Ibn Umar was asked about the two Rak'ahs before Maghrib, so he said: I did not see anyone during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, praying them.

The author of (Al-Mashariq) restricted its attribution to Al-Bukhari, and likewise Al-Nawawi in (Al-Majmu') (3/29). Al-Sindi said: It seems the meaning in it and similar ones is the prohibition of frequently using the language of the Bedouins such that the language of Bedouins prevails over the Sharia name, so the usage of the Sharia name becomes rare among people and the usage of the Bedouin name becomes frequent. So it does not contradict using the name Isha rarely. For this reason, a similar prohibition came regarding using the name Al-Atamah for Isha, then the usage of the name Al-Atamah for Isha came in the Sharia rarely.

Ibn Sayyid Al-Nas seemed to have taken it from him. This is the school of the majority. And its last time is when the night is half over, as in the Hadith of Abu Huraira and Ibn Amr previously mentioned. It is the school of Ibn Hazm (2/164).

(It is written in the original without dots. Like this in (Al-Muhalla). I say: The correct reading is: 'You wish' (Shi'ta).

    "text": "(And pray Isha between you and a third of the night; and if you wish, then to half of the night, and do not be of the heedless). This is a very Sahih chain. As for what Al-Tahawi narrated from the path of Sufyan Al-Thawri from Habib bin Abi Thabit from Nafi bin Jubayr who said: Umar wrote to Abu Musa: (And pray Isha any [time of] night you wish and do not neglect it), it contradicts what preceded. The defect of this narration is the interruption between Habib and Nafi, for Habib, although trustworthy, was frequent in sending Mursal narrations and Tadlis (obfuscating chain) as in (Al-Taqrib). And you see that he used 'an' (from) and did not explicitly state hearing it, so his narration is not used as evidence, especially since it contradicted what trustworthy narrators narrated. This view [of extended time] was narrated from Malik as a saying in (Bidayat Al-Mujtahid) (75). It is the view of Abu Sa'id Al-Istakhri who said: (If a third of the night or its half goes, the prayer is missed and becomes Qada). Mentioned in (Al-Muhadhdhab). It is the apparent meaning of Imam Al-Shafi'i's saying in the chapter of Facing the Qibla: (If a third of the night passes, I do not see it except as missed). Al-Nawawi said in (Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab) (3/40): (Some of our companions agreed with Al-Istakhri due to the apparent meaning of this text, and the majority interpreted it). I say: Among Al-Shafi'i's proofs for his view of the third is the Hadith of Aisha who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, delayed Isha one night until it was dark (Atamah).

He said: (Take your seats). So we took our seats. He said: (Indeed, the people have prayed and taken to their beds, and indeed you will not cease to be in prayer as long as you wait for the prayer.

Some of the early literalists (Ahl al-Zahir) used it as evidence for what we mentioned. And Al-Shawkani the investigator from the later scholars (1/10). Ibn Hazm refuted that strongly, saying (3/178): This does not indicate what they said at all. They agree with us without dispute from any of the Imams that the time of Fajr prayer does not extend to the time of Dhuhr prayer. So it is correct that this report does not indicate the connection of the time of every prayer to the time of the one after it.

Necessity dictates that whoever transgresses with any deed its time which Allah defined for that deed, he has transgressed the limits of Allah. And Allah the Exalted said: (And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah - it is those who are the wrongdoers). And the second Hadith is from Aisha, she said: The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, delayed Isha one night until the general part of the night went and until the people of the mosque slept. Then he came out and prayed and said: (Indeed, it is its time were it not that I would burden my Ummah).

So the apparent meaning of the Hadith is that he prayed it after the first half of the night passed. However, the Hadith is interpreted. Al-Nawawi said: (The intended meaning by 'general part of the night' is much of it, and the intended is not the majority of it. This interpretation is necessary due to his saying, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him: 'Indeed, it is its time'. And it is not permissible that the meaning of this statement is what is after half the night because no one from the scholars said that delaying it to after half the night is better).

Rather, it contains: (Until Umar bin Al-Khattab called out to him: The women and boys have slept). And that usually happens before half the night. This is strengthened by the fact that Ibn Abbas narrated this Hadith more completely than it, saying: The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, delayed Isha one night until [part] of the night went. So Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, stood and called out: Prayer, O Messenger of Allah, the women and children have slept. So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, came out while water was dripping from his head, and he was saying: (Indeed, it is the time, were it not that I would burden my Ummah). Narrated by Al-Nasa'i (92) and Al-Darimi (276) from the path of Sufyan from Amr from Ata from him, and from Ibn Jarir from Ata from him. These are two Sahih chains on the condition of the two Sheikhs. Muslim (117) and Ahmad (1/366) narrated it from Ibn Jurayj with it, and it contains the explicit statement of Ibn Jurayj hearing from Ata. So this narration indicates that the Hadith of Aisha by the narration of Umm Kulthum from her, and her Hadith by the narration of Urwah from her, are but one Hadith which some narrators abbreviated. It indicates clearly that his saying in it: (Indeed, it is the time) intends by it the time when the women and children slept, and that is before half the night usually as we said. So the Hadith returns to [the meaning] that the intended by 'general part of the night' is much of it, not the majority of it, as Al-Nawawi said, and this is from the precision of his understanding, may Allah have mercy on him. Even if one must take the apparent meaning of Umm Kulthum's Hadith from her, this only indicates that he prayed it at the beginning of the second half. For that reason, Ibn Hazm said (3/184):",

So whoever says Takbir for it in the beginning of the second half of the night has caught the prayer of Atamah without dislike nor necessity. If he exceeds that, the time for entering the prayer of Atamah has exited). As for it indicating the extension of the time to Fajr prayer as Al-Tahawi claimed, there is not the slightest evidence in it for that. It is a view of Al-Shafi'i as Al-Shawkani mentioned (2/10). And the night ends with the rising of the true dawn, which is the school of the Shafi'is and all scholars. Refer to (Al-Majmu') (3/10).

This is a good (Jayyid) chain. Regarding this waiting, the saying of the Exalted was revealed: (They are not [all] the same; among the People of the Scripture... And Allah is Knowing of the righteous) [Al Imran / 113-115]. Ibn Masud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, delayed the Isha prayer then came out to the mosque, and behold, people were waiting for the prayer. He said: (Beware, there is no one from the people of these religions remembering Allah at this hour other than you). He said: And these verses were revealed: (They are not [all] the same; among the People of the Scripture...) until he reached: (And whatever good they do - never will it be denied them. And Allah is Knowing of the righteous). Narrated by Ahmad (1/394) from Shayban from Asim from Zirr from him. This is a Hasan chain. He used to not make it determined upon them due to the hardship in it as preceded. Despite that, he, peace be upon him, used to consider the conditions of those gathered, few or many. He would sometimes delay it and sometimes hasten. If he saw them gathered, he hastened, and if he saw them slow, he delayed. (Kh, M, Ham: 3/369) and Taya (124) from Abu Barza.",

She said: O Urwah or O Urayyah! What is this Samar (night conversation)? I never saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, sleeping before this prayer nor speaking after it; either sleeping and safe, or praying and gaining [reward]. This is also an improved (Muhassan) chain, and its men are the men of Al-Bukhari.

Al-Tahawi (2/390) narrated it from the path of Wuhaib and Hammad bin Salamah from Ata with the wording: 'Hadaba ilayna' (urged us) with the unpointed Ha (H). It is not a typo, for Al-Tahawi made it evidence for the permissibility of Samar in what is an act of closeness, so he said: And he urged (Hadaba) them to what is an act of closeness.

Its men are the men of Al-Bukhari, but Ata had become confused. Al-Tirmidhi said: Most scholars disliked sleeping before Isha prayer and talking after it, and some of them permitted that. Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak said: Most Hadiths are for dislike. What appears from the sum of Hadiths reported in this chapter is the dislike of Samar and staying up late except in what is beneficial to the speaker or beneficial to the Muslims. Regarding that are Hadiths: (1) From Umar bin Al-Khattab, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, used to converse (yasmuur) with Abu Bakr regarding the command from the commands of Muslims, and I was with them. Narrated by Al-Tirmidhi (1/315), Ibn Nasr (46), and Al-Tahawi (391) from the path of Abu Mu'awiyah from Al-A'mash from Ibrahim from Alqamah from him. This is a Sahih chain on their condition. Al-Tirmidhi restricted himself to calling it Hasan, which is a shortcoming as clarified by the commentator on it. Ahmad (1/25-26) narrated it with two chains from Umar, saying: Abu Mu'awiyah told us: Al-A'mash told us from Ibrahim from Alqamah, he said: A man came to Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, while he was at Arafat. [Abu] Mu'awiyah said: And Al-A'mash told us from Khaythamah from Qays bin Marwan - or he said he came to Umar, may Allah be pleased with him... So he mentioned the Hadith at length.

He said: So the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, spoke with his family for a while then slept. Narrated by Muslim (2/182) and Ibn Nasr (46). (3) From Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, that Usaid bin Hudair and another man from the Ansar spoke in the presence of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, one night regarding a need of theirs until a period of the night went, and the night was intensely dark. Then they left the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, returning, and in the hand of each one was a staff. The staff of one of them lit up for them until they walked in its light. When the road separated them, the staff of the other lit up for him, so each one of them walked in his light until he reached his family. Narrated by Ibn Nasr from Abdur-Razzaq: Ma'mar informed us from Thabit from him. This is a Sahih chain on the condition of the Six. What indicates the reconciliation we mentioned is: What Abu Sa'id, the freed slave of the Ansar, narrated; he said: Umar would not leave anyone talking (samir) after Isha, saying: Go back, perhaps Allah will grant you a prayer or night prayer (Tahajjud).

Ahmad added in a narration from Abdur-Razzaq from Malik: I said to Malik: Is it disliked that we say: Al-Atamah? He said: Thus said the one who told me. And that was established from some of the Companions like Jabir bin Samurah in Muslim (118) and Ahmad (5/89 and 105) and others, and Jabir bin Abdullah in Ahmad (3/348) and others. Ibn Al-Qayyim (2/12) said after mentioning the Hadith of Ibn Umar then this Hadith of Abu Huraira: (It was said: This abrogates the prohibition, and it was said the opposite. The correct view is contrary to both sayings, for knowledge of dates is impossible, and there is no contradiction between the two Hadiths. He did not forbid the utterance of the name Al-Atamah completely, but rather he forbade that the name Al-Isha be abandoned, which is the name Allah called it in His Book, and that the name Al-Atamah prevails over it. So if it is called Al-Isha and sometimes Al-Atamah is applied to it, there is no harm. And Allah knows best. This is preservation from him, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, of the names with which Allah named the acts of worship, so they are not abandoned and others preferred over them, as the later generations did in abandoning the words of the texts and preferring newly invented terminologies over them.

Muslim (3/129) and Kh, and he added: to his right and his left. 3 - He, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, used to pray it in Ghalas (darkness of the end of night).

When he said Salam, I turned to Ibn Umar and said: What is this prayer? He said: This was our prayer with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and Abu Bakr and Umar.

It has a witness from the Hadith of Qilah in Tab (230), Taha (105), and from Harmalah Al-Anbari with him, and likewise Al-Tayalisi (167). 6 - And sometimes he would exit from it in Isfar when a man recognizes the face of his sitting companion, as Abu Barza Al-Aslamis said: The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, used to turn away from the morning prayer (Ghadah) when a man recognized his sitting companion. Kh, M (119-120), D (66), N (92), Taha (105), Taya (124), Ham (4/420, 423, 424, and 425) from Sayyar bin Salamah from him. 7 - This Isfar is the intended meaning of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (Make Fajr light (Asfiru), for it is greater in reward), meaning: exit from it at the time of Isfar, and that is by prolonging the recitation in it. This interpretation is necessary so that his saying, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, agrees with his action which he persisted upon of entering it at the time of Ghalas as preceded. This is what Hafiz Ibn Al-Qayyim preferred in (I'lam Al-Muwaqqi'in). Imam Al-Tahawi from the Hanafis preceded him to that and elaborated on establishing that (1/104-109). He said: (It is the view of Abu Hanifa, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad), even if what he reported from the three Imams contradicts what is famous from them in the books of the Madhhab regarding the recommendation of starting with Isfar. Among the later Hanafis, Allamah Abu Al-Hasanat Al-Lucknawi also inclined to this reconciliation in (Al-Ta'liq lil-Majd) (42-44). As for the mentioned Hadith, it is a Sahih Hadith but disputed in its wording. Al-Tirmidhi (289), Al-Darimi (277 T), Al-Tahawi (106), and Al-Tayalisi (129) narrated it with the mentioned wording, all from Muhammad bin Ishaq from Asim bin Umar bin Qatadah from Mahmoud bin Labid from Rafi' bin Khadij with it. This is a Hasan chain were it not for the 'an'anah (using 'from') of Muhammad bin Ishaq, for he is a Mudallis, so it is possible he heard it via an intermediary from Asim. What supports this possibility will come. Abu Dawood (69), Ibn Majah (230), and Ahmad (4/140) narrated it, all from Sufyan bin Uyaynah from Ibn Ajlan from Asim with it with the wording: Asbihu (Enter the morning). Instead of: Asfiru. Likewise, Ibn Ishaq narrated it from Ibn Ajlan, so Ahmad said (3/465): Yazid told us, he said: Muhammad bin Ishaq told us, he said: Ibn Ajlan informed us with it. Abu Khalid Al-Ahmar contradicted them from Ibn Ajlan, narrating it from him with the wording: (Asfiru). Ahmad narrated it from him (4/142), and likewise Yahya bin Sa'id in Al-Nasa'i, and Sufyan Al-Thawri in Al-Tahawi (105), and likewise Al-Darimi except he said: (Nawwiru - Illuminate). Ibn Ajlan was followed in it; Zaid bin Aslam narrated it from Asim bin Umar but there was disagreement on him regarding it in chain and text. As for the chain, Abu Ghassan narrated it: Zaid bin Aslam told me from Asim bin Umar from Mahmoud from Labid from men of his people from the Ansar that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said... so he mentioned it.",

As for the text, Abu Ghassan said: (Whatever Isfar (light) you make with Fajr). Al-Layth said: (Asbihu (Enter morning) with Subh, for whenever you enter morning with it). And Asbat said: (Asfiru). Hafs bin Maysarah followed Hisham from Zaid like the narration of Al-Layth in chain and text. Al-Tahawi narrated it (105-106).

There is another disagreement on Zaid bin Aslam mentioned in (Nasb Al-Rayah) (1/236), so refer to it. In summary, this is intense confusion in the Hadith. The correct view regarding the chain is the narration of Ibn Ajlan from Asim bin Umar from Mahmoud bin Labid from Rafi' bin Khadij due to two matters: For its connection, and for its agreement with the narration of Abu Ghassan from Zaid bin Aslam in text and chain, except for the ambiguity of its narrators from the Companions from him, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, which is not a grave contradiction as is obvious. Its chain is Sahih as in (Nasb Al-Rayah) (238). The Hadith has many witnesses whose chains are not free from criticism. Al-Zayla'i extracted them, and likewise Al-Haythami in (Al-Majmu') (1/315-317), so whoever wishes may refer to them. All of them are with the wording: (Asfiru). And some: (Nawwiru). So they generally support the wording which we preferred from the Hadith of Rafi', which is: Asfiru. However, you have known from what preceded that the meaning is not: Make it Isfar at the beginning, but at the end. Except that what Ibn Abi Hatim extracted in (Al-Ilal) (1/139 and 143-144), Al-Tayalisi (129), Ibn Abi Shaybah, Ishaq bin Rahwayh in his Musnads, and Al-Tabarani in his (Mu'jam) from the path of Ismail bin Ibrahim Al-Madini from Hurayr bin Abdul Rahman bin Rafi' bin Khadij from Rafi' bin Khadij disturbs this meaning.

Even if it were authentic, it could be interpreted like what preceded in the Hadith of Rafi', so his saying: 'Until the people see the locations of their arrows' means: at the time of finishing it, not the beginning. And what Al-Bukhari (3/427), M (4/76), D (1/305), N (2/47), Ham (1/426 and 434) narrated from the Hadith of Ibn Masud, who said: I never saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, pray a prayer except at its appointed time except two prayers: Maghrib and Isha at Jam' (Muzdalifah), and he prayed Fajr that day before its appointed time. And in a narration of Al-Bukhari (3/467) and Ahmad (418 and 449) from Abdul Rahman bin Yazid who said: I went out with Abdullah [bin Masud], may Allah be pleased with him, to Mecca, then we arrived at Jam'. So he prayed the two prayers, each prayer alone with Adhan and Iqamah, and dinner between them. Then he prayed Fajr when dawn rose. Someone said: Dawn has risen. And someone said: Dawn has not risen. Then he said: Indeed, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (Indeed, these two prayers were shifted from their time in this place, Maghrib and Isha, so people should not arrive at Jam' until they pray Isha (yu'timu), and this Fajr prayer at this hour). This narration clarifies that his saying in the first narration: 'And he prayed Fajr that day before...",

    "text": "...its appointed time' is not upon its literal meaning, due to his saying in this one: 'Then he prayed Fajr when dawn rose'. This is like the statement of Jabir in his long Hadith: 'And he prayed Fajr when the dawn became clear to him'. Narrated by Muslim and others. So the meaning, therefore, is that he prayed Fajr before its usual appointed time [for him], meaning: he prayed in Ghalas (darkness) intensely, contradicting the usual Ghalas to the extent that some of them doubted the rising of dawn. Therefore, Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Fath) (3/413): (There is no proof in it for those who prevent Ghalas in Fajr prayer, because Ghalas in it is established from Aisha and others as preceded. Rather, the meaning here is that when the Mu'adhin came to him at the rising of dawn, he prayed the two Rak'ahs of Fajr [Sunnah] in his house then came out and prayed Subh with that in Ghalas. As for Muzdalifah, the people were gathered and the dawn was before their eyes, so they hastened to prayer as soon as it emerged, such that some of them did not perceive its rising as in the second narration). 1 - If it is the habit of the Imams to delay the prayer from its chosen time, the Muslim should pray it in the time in his house, then pray it with them whenever they pray, and it will be a voluntary prayer (Nafilah) for him. The Second: Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to me: (How will you be if there are rulers over you who delay the prayer from its time or kill the prayer from its time?) He said: I said: So what do you order me? He said: (Pray the prayer at its time, then if you catch it with them, pray, for it will be a voluntary prayer for you).",

The context is Muslim's then Abu Dawood's, and the others do not have his saying: (or kill the prayer), which is doubt from some of the narrators with them. It appears to be Hammad bin Zaid, for everyone who narrated it from Abu Imran said: (Delay the prayer) without doubt.

Salih is from the men of Muslim, but some spoke about him; it is said in (Al-Taqrib): (He is truthful, frequent in mistakes).

The Hadith has witnesses: (1) From Ubadah bin Al-Samit, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (Indeed there will be rulers over you after me whom things will distract from prayer at its time until its time goes, so pray the prayer at its time). A man said: O Messenger of Allah, do I pray with them? He said: (Yes, if you wish).

Then Ahmad narrated it (5/314-315 and 6/7) from the path of Shu'bah from Mansur from Hilal bin Yasaf from Abu Al-Muthanna bin the wife of Ubadah bin Al-Samit from him. Then Ahmad narrated it (5/314-315 and 6/7) from the path of Shu'bah from Mansur from Hilal bin Yasaf from Abu Al-Muthanna from Abu Ubayy bin the wife of Ubadah bin Al-Samit from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, with it with the wording: (So pray the prayer at its time then make your prayer with them voluntary). So he made it from the Musnad of Abu Ubayy not from the Musnad of Ubadah bin Al-Samit. Likewise, Ahmad also narrated it (315) from the path of Ya'mar - meaning: Ibn Bishr -: Abdullah informed us: Sufyan informed us from Mansur with it with the wording: He said: We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, so he said...

For what is reported from the early and late rulers is only delaying it from its chosen time, and none of them delayed it from its entire (1) time. So it is obligatory to interpret these reports according to reality. The meaning of 'Pray prayer at its time' is at its first time. Then he said: In it is that if the Imam delays it from its first time, it is recommended for the follower to pray it in the first time individually then pray it with the Imam, thus combining praying at the first time and the congregation. If he wanted to restrict himself to one of them, is it better to restrict himself to performing it individually at the first time or restrict himself to performing it in congregation at the last time? There is a famous disagreement. He said: The chosen view is the recommendation of waiting if the delay is not excessive. Sheikh Al-Islam said in (Al-Ikhtiyarat) (p. 19): (The majority of scholars view that advancing prayer is better unless there is a preponderant benefit in delaying, like the one performing Tayammum delaying to pray at the end of time with Wudu, and the solitary person delaying to pray at the end of time with a congregation). I say: The correct view indicated by the Hadiths is what Al-Nawawi mentioned and chose of the recommendation of waiting if the delay is not excessive.",

Because he only intended by it that he prays both of them as obligatory, as Ibn Abd Al-Barr said. Or it is of the general specific to these Hadiths and their likes. Some of them will come in their places. This is more appropriate to me than what Ibn Abd Al-Barr said, because it necessitates the permissibility of repeating every prayer he prayed with the congregation to pray it again individually as voluntary, and I do not believe any scholar believes that. This Hadith was narrated by Abu Dawood (95), Al-Nasa'i (138), Al-Daraqutni (159 and 160), Al-Tahawi (1/187), and Ahmad (2/19 and 41) from the path of Husayn bin Dhakwan: Amr bin Shu'ayb informed me: Sulayman, the freed slave of Maimuna, informed me, he said: I came upon Ibn Umar one day while he was sitting on the pavement (Balat) and people were in Asr prayer.

Al-Khattabi said: The intended by Sajdah is the Rak'ah with its Ruku' and Sujud, and the Rak'ah is only completed by its Sujud, so it was named based on this as Sajdah. These Hadiths indicate that whoever catches a Rak'ah before the time exits, it is valid even if the second Rak'ah occurs in the prohibited time like Fajr and Asr prayer. This is the school of the majority. Abu Hanifa disagreed on some of that, saying: Whoever the sun rises upon while he is in Subh prayer, his prayer is invalid. Al-Tahawi argued for him with the Hadiths reported regarding the prohibition of prayer at sunrise, claiming that this argument abrogates the Hadith of Aisha and the Hadith of Abu Huraira before it, which is a claim that needs proof.",

    "text": "The truth is that the Hadiths of prohibition are general, encompassing every prayer except what the Lawgiver excluded, so it becomes a specification for these Hadiths. Of this type is this Hadith of Abu Huraira, for it is specific and takes precedence over the general as established in Principles (Usul). Furthermore, the concept of the Hadith implies that whoever catches less than a Rak'ah does not catch the time. The majority went to this view as in (Nail Al-Awtar). Refer to the completion of this discussion in it (2/19-20). 4 - This ruling is specifically for the one who deliberately delays prayer to this tight time. Otherwise, the sleeper and the forgetter never miss the prayer even if its entire time exits as long as he is heedless of it or forgetting it. For the time regarding them is when remembering. He, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said in his journey in which they slept until the sun rose: (Indeed you were dead, so Allah returned your souls to you. So whoever sleeps through a prayer, let him pray it when he wakes up, and whoever forgets a prayer, let him pray when he remembers). Abu Ya'la and Al-Tabarani in (Al-Kabir) narrated it from the Hadith of Abu Juhayfah. Its men are trustworthy as in (Al-Mu'jam). The Hadith has many witnesses, among them: From Abu Qatadah who said: They mentioned to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, their sleeping through prayer. So he said: (Indeed, there is no negligence in sleep; negligence is only in wakefulness. So if one of you forgets a prayer or sleeps through it, let him pray it when he remembers it).",

He said: (It is the saying of Abu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy on him). The commentator upon it, Abu al-Hasan al-Laknawi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: (A group of our companions, including Al-Ayni and others, supported it with what was reported in the Hadith of Ta'rees [stopping for rest at night], that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) moved from that place and prayed after that, and that could only have been because it was the time of sunrise. This is open to question: First, because the reasoning for the choice was explicitly reported as being a place of heedlessness and a place where Satan was present, so one should not deviate from that [reason]. Second, because it was reported in the narration of Malik and others: 'until the sun struck them.' And in some narrations of Al-Bukhari: 'he did not wake up until he felt the heat of the sun.' And that is not possible except some time after sunrise and after the time of dislike has passed). This is a good, strong critique from the strong author Abu al-Hasan, and his likes are few among the followers of the Madhhabs among the later generations. So may Allah Almighty have mercy on him and reward him with good. The reasoning he mentioned was reported in (Sahih Muslim) (2/138) and Al-Nasa'i (1/102) from Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: We stopped for rest with the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and we did not wake up until the sun rose.

So what is missed, there is no way to retrieve it at all; if it were possible to retrieve it, it would not be called 'missed'. See (Al-Salah) by Ibn al-Qayyim. This is the school of Dawud al-Zahiri and also Ibn Hazm, who elaborated on establishing this in a way not preceded. He said: And among those who held our view in this are Umar bin al-Khattab, his son Abdullah, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, Salman (the Companion of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Ibn Mas'ud, Al-Qasim bin Muhammad bin Abi Bakr, Budayl al-Uqayli, Muhammad bin Sirin, Mutarrif bin Abdullah, Umar bin Abd al-Aziz, and others. Al-Hasan al-Basri said it: If a man leaves a single prayer intentionally, he does not make it up. (Al-Salah) (107). Then he said: We do not know of any opponent from among the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) whom we mentioned. Refer to (Al-Muhalla) (2/235-244). Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah chose this view, saying in (Al-Ikhtiyarat) (p. 19): (And the one who abandons prayer intentionally, it is not prescribed for him to make it up, nor is it valid from him; rather, he should increase in voluntary prayers. The same applies to fasting. This is the view of a group of the Salaf, such as Abu Abd al-Rahman the companion of Al-Shafi'i, Dawud, and his followers. There is nothing in the evidences that contradicts this; rather, it agrees with it. And his command (peace be upon him) to the one who had intercourse [during Ramadan fast] to make it up is weak due to Al-Bukhari and Muslim avoiding it).",

Dawud, Ibn Hazm, and some companions of Al-Shafi'i went to this view. It was narrated in (Al-Bahr) from the two Hadis and Al-Ustadh, and a narration from Al-Qasim and Al-Nasir. Ibn Taymiyyah (Sheikh al-Islam) said: Those who dispute with them have no proof whatsoever to refer to in case of dispute. Most of them say: Making up (Qada') is not obligatory except by a new command, and they have no command here. We do not dispute only the obligation of making up, but we dispute the acceptance of the makeup from him and the validity of the prayer outside its time). He elaborated on the discussion regarding that and chose what Dawud and those with him mentioned. And the matter is as he mentioned, for despite the intense research of those mandating makeup for the intentional leaver - and they are everyone other than those we mentioned - I have not come across a proof that holds value in the marketplace of debate or is suitable to rely upon in such a great principle, except the hadith: (So the debt of Allah is more deserving to be paid), considering the generality implied by the genitive noun. However, they did not pay attention to it. The strongest argument they brought in this position is their saying: The hadiths mandating makeup for the forgetful imply by the concept of their address the obligation of makeup for the intentional leaver, because it is alerting to the greater by the lesser, so it indicates the requirement by the tenor of the address and a fortiori analogy. This is rejected, because the one who says that the intentional leaver does not make up does not mean that his condition is lighter than the forgetful one; rather, [he means] that what prevents the obligation of makeup on the intentional leaver is that it does not drop the sin",

That is why he said: (The station has straitened), and he blamed those who said: 'The chapter of makeup is built on no foundation, containing neither Book nor Sunnah,' attributing negligence to them due to his inability to answer the referred hadith. Ibn Abd al-Barr preceded him in this deduction. Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, answered it in the treatise (Al-Salah) with something that leaves absolutely no room for doubt that the hadith does not indicate that. Its summary is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only said the hadith regarding those with excuses, not the negligent one, and we say that such a debt is accepted to be paid. Also, he (peace be upon him) said this regarding the absolute vow which has no time limit on both ends, and regarding Hajj whose time does not expire except with the end of life. Refer to (pp. 109-110) of the mentioned treatise.

And that was before it was revealed regarding the Fear Prayer: {And if you fear [an enemy], then [pray] on foot or riding} [Al-Baqarah / 239].

Scholars differed regarding the obligation of order (Tartib) between missed prayers. The Shafi'is negated it and said: It is recommended. Tawus, Al-Hasan al-Basri, Muhammad bin al-Hasan, Abu Thawr, and Dawud said this. Abu Hanifa and Malik said: It is obligatory as long as the missed prayers do not exceed the prayers of one day and night. They said: If he is in a present prayer and remembers during it that he owes a missed prayer, the present one becomes invalid and he must prioritize the missed one then pray the present one. Zufar and Ahmad said: Order is obligatory whether the missed prayers are few or many. Ahmad said: If he forgot the missed prayers, the prayers he prayed after them are valid. Ahmad and Ishaq said: If he remembers a missed prayer while in a present prayer, he completes the one he is in, then makes up the missed prayer, then he must repeat the present prayer. They argued with a hadith from Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: (Whoever forgets a prayer and does not remember it until he is with the Imam, when he finishes his prayer, let him repeat the prayer he forgot, then let him repeat the prayer he prayed with the Imam). This is a weak hadith. Musa bin Harun al-Hammal (with a Ha) al-Hafiz weakened it. Abu Zur'ah al-Razi and then Al-Bayhaqi said:",

The relied-upon view in the issue is that they are debts upon him, so order is not obligatory for them except with clear evidence, and they have no clear evidence. And because whoever prays them without order has performed the prayer he was ordered to do, so an additional description is not binding upon him without clear evidence. And Allah knows best). 6 - The Adhan. 1 - Before that, they used to call one another when the time for prayer came. That was by a signal from Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and his command (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for that. Abdullah bin Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: When the Muslims arrived in Medina, they used to gather and guess the times for prayers, and no one called for them. So they spoke one day about that. Some of them said: Adopt a bell like the bell of the Christians. And some of them said: A horn like the horn of the Jews.

He said: So Allah directed him towards Mecca. He said: This is one shift. He said: And they used to gather for prayer and call one another for it until they used bells [Naqas] or were about to use bells. He said: Then a man from the Ansar called Abdullah bin Zaid came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I saw in what the sleeper sees - and if I said I was not sleeping I would be truthful - that while I was between sleeping and waking, I saw a figure wearing two green garments facing the Qiblah and saying: Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar, Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah, two by two, until he finished the Adhan. Then he waited an hour. He said: Then he said the like of what he said, except that he added to it: Qad qamat is-salah, Qad qamat is-salah (Prayer has been established). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: (Teach it to Bilal, for let him call the Adhan with it). So Bilal was the first to call the Adhan with it. He said: And Umar bin al-Khattab came and said: O Messenger of Allah, there visited me the like of what visited him, except that he preceded me. So these are two shifts. The Hadith.

Abdullah bin Zaid said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered the bell to be made so that it could be struck for people to gather for prayer, a man carrying a bell in his hand walked around me while I was sleeping.

Ibn Khuzaimah said in his (Sahih): This is an authentic hadith, established by way of transmission, because Muhammad heard from his father, and Ibn Ishaq heard from Al-Taymi, and this is not among what he practiced Tadlis in). Ibn Ishaq has another chain for it narrated by Ahmad (4/42-43) from him, saying: Muhammad bin Muslim al-Zuhri mentioned from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib from Abdullah bin Zaid bin Abd Rabbih who said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) resolved to strike the bell to gather the people for prayer, while he disliked it due to conformity with the Christians, a visitor walked around me at night while I was sleeping, a man wearing two green garments and carrying a bell in his hand. He said: So I said to him: O servant of Allah, are you selling the bell... The Hadith, similar to it. And he added at its end: So Bilal, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to call Adhan with that and call the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to prayer. He said: He came and called him one morning for Fajr, and it was said to him: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is sleeping. He said: So Bilal screamed at the top of his voice: As-salatu khairun min an-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep). Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib said: So this phrase was introduced into the Adhan for the Fajr prayer. This is also a good chain. And Ibn Ishaq, although he did not explicitly state his hearing from Al-Zuhri, has been followed in it by a group. Al-Hakim said (3/336): (The hadith of Al-Zuhri from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib is famous; it was narrated by Yunus bin Yazid, Ma'mar ibn Rashid, Shu'ayb bin Abi Hamzah, Muhammad bin Ishaq, and others).",

The hadith has a witness from the hadith of Abu Umair bin Anas from his uncles from the Ansar who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was concerned about prayer, how to gather people for it. It was said to him: Set up a flag when the prayer time comes; when they see it, they will inform one another. But that did not please him. He said: So the Qan' was mentioned to him - meaning the horn, and in a narration: the horn of the Jews - but that did not please him and he said: (It is from the matter of the Jews). He said: So the bell was mentioned to him and he said: (It is from the matter of the Christians). Abdullah bin Zaid left concerned due to the concern of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he was shown the Adhan in his sleep. He said: So he went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the morning and informed him. He said to him: O Messenger of Allah, I was between sleeping and waking when a comer came to me and showed me the Adhan. He said: Umar had seen it before that but concealed it for twenty days.

The view of its obligation - as we mentioned - is the saying of Ahmad and a view of the Shafi'is, and Dawud al-Zahiri and his companions held it. Ibn Hazm added to them (3/122-125) making it a condition for the validity of prayer, such that it is not valid without it, which is not apparent. Ibn Taymiyyah was asked about the Adhan: Is it Fard or Sunnah? He answered by saying: (The correct view is that the Adhan is a communal obligation (Fard Kifayah). It is not for the people of a city or a village to abandon the Adhan and Iqamah. This is the famous view in the Madhhab of Ahmad and others. Groups of scholars have loosely termed it a Sunnah, then among these are those who say if the people of a town agree to abandon it, they are fought. The dispute with these is close to a verbal dispute, for many scholars apply the term Sunnah to that whose abandoner is blameworthy in the Sharia and whose abandoner is punished in the Sharia. As for whoever claims it is a Sunnah for which there is no sin on its abandoner nor punishment, this saying is a mistake. For the Adhan is the symbol of the Abode of Islam, about which it is established in (Al-Sahih) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to condition the lawfulness of the people of the abode on its abandonment). Then he mentioned the hadith of Anas and the hadith of Abu Darda, then said: (And Allah Almighty has said: {Satan has overcome them and made them forget the remembrance of Allah. Those are the party of Satan. Unquestionably, the party of Satan - they will be the losers} [Al-Mujadilah / 19]). (Al-Fatawa) (1/67-68) and (4/20).

    "text": "(This is a Hasan Sahih hadith). It is on the condition of Muslim, and he narrated it in his (Sahih) as will come shortly. Ibn Khuzaimah narrated it in his (Sahih) with the wording: (So he taught him the Adhan and Iqamah two by two). Ibn Hibban also narrated it in his (Sahih). He said in (Al-Imam): This chain is on the condition of the Sahih; Hammad bin Yahya was used as proof by the two Sheikhs, and Amir bin Abd al-Wahid was used as proof by Muslim as in (Nasb al-Rayah) (1/268). Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Talkhis) (3/164): (Al-Bayhaqi criticized it with aspects of weakening, which Ibn Daqiq al-Eid rebutted in Al-Imam and authenticated the hadith). Then Al-Darimi narrated the hadith: Sa'id bin Amir informed us from Hammad with it with the wording: (That the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered about twenty men so they called Adhan, and he was pleased with Abu Mahdhurah's voice, so he taught him the Adhan). I say: So he mentioned it with nineteen words, then said: And the Iqamah is two by two. Its chain is also authentic on the condition of Muslim. He narrated it in his (Sahih) (2/3) via Mu'adh bin Hisham: My father told me from Amir al-Ahwal with it: That the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him this Adhan: Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah. Then he returns and says: Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah... And the rest is like it.",

    "text": "Thus it occurred in (Sahih Muslim): Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar, only twice. Al-Nasa'i narrated it (1/103): Ishaq bin Ibrahim informed us, he said: Mu'adh bin Hisham informed us with it, except that he mentioned the Takbir at the beginning: four times. This Ishaq is one of Muslim's two teachers in this hadith; the other is Abu Ghassan al-Masma'i Malik bin Abd al-Wahid. Perhaps he is the one who narrated it with dual Takbir instead of Ishaq, for he [Ishaq] narrated it with quadruple Takbir as in Al-Nasa'i. Likewise, Abu Nu'aym narrated it in (Al-Mustakhraj) and Al-Bayhaqi via Ishaq bin Ibrahim from Mu'adh bin Hisham with his chain, and in it is the quadruple Takbir. Abu Awanah also narrated it in his (Mustakhraj) via Ali bin al-Madini from Mu'adh. That is why Ibn al-Qattan said: (The correct view in this is the quadrupling of Takbir, and with it, the Adhan being nineteen words becomes correct, and it was restricted by that in the hadith itself. He said: It may occur in some narrations of Muslim with quadruple Takbir, which is what should be counted in the Sahih). Ended from (Al-Talkhis) (3/160). The hadith has another path from Ibn Muhayriz. Ibn Juraij narrated it, saying: Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd al-Malik bin Abi Mahdhurah told me that Abdullah bin Muhayriz informed him - and he was an orphan under the care of Abu Mahdhurah when he equipped him for Sham - he said: I said to Abu Mahdhurah: I am going out to Sham and I fear I will be asked about your Adhan. So inform me. Abu Mahdhurah said to him:",

So we met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on some road. The Mu'adhin of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called the prayer in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). We heard the voice of the Mu'adhin while we were avoiding him. So we started imitating him and mocking him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard the voice and sent for us until we stood before him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: (Which of you is the one whose voice I heard rising?) The group pointed to me and told the truth. So he released all of them but detained me. He said: (Stand and call for the prayer). So I stood, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cast the Adhan upon me himself. He said: (Say: Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah. Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah. Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah). Then he said: (Return and extend your voice). Then he said: (Say: Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah.

La ilaha illa Allah). Then he called me when I finished the Adhan and gave me a pouch containing some silver. I said: O Messenger of Allah, order me to call Adhan in Mecca. He said: (I have ordered you with it). So I came to Attab bin Asid, the governor of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Mecca, and I called Adhan with him for prayer by the command of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

Based on this, (As-salatu khairun min an-nawm) is not from the words of the Adhan prescribed to call for prayer and announce the entry of its time; rather, it is from the words prescribed to wake the sleeper. See the completion of this discussion in (Subul al-Salam) (167-168). (Note): Al-Tahawi (1/81-82) devoted a chapter to the Mu'adhin saying in the Morning Adhan: As-salatu khairun min an-nawm. Then he mentioned that some people disliked that, and others opposed them and recommended it. He said: (It is the saying of Abu Hanifa, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad, may Allah have mercy on them. This contradicts what Imam Muhammad stated in his (Muwatta) where he said (84): (As-salatu khairun min an-nawm is in the Morning call after finishing the call, and nothing should be added to the call that is not part of it). This is explicit that it is not recommended to say it in the Morning Adhan as Al-Tahawi headed it, but after it. And Allah knows best. The Second Place: If there is severe cold or rain, he adds after saying: Hayya 'ala al-falah or after finishing the Adhan: Sallu fi ar-rihal (Pray in the dwellings). Or he says: Wa man qa'ada fala haraja 'alayh (And whoever sits [stays back] there is no blame on him). Regarding that are hadiths: (1) From Ibn Abbas, narrated from him by Abdullah bin al-Harith who said: Ibn Abbas delivered a sermon to us on a day of mud (rain). When the Mu'adhin reached Hayya 'ala as-salah, he ordered him to call: As-salatu fi ar-rihal (Prayer in the dwellings). The people looked at one another, so he said:",

However, Al-Tabarani narrated it from another path whose narrators are narrators of (Al-Sahih) as stated in (Al-Majma') (2/47). Al-Hafiz mentioned it in (Al-Fath) (2/78) similar to the narration of (Al-Kabir) and said: (Narrated by Abd al-Razzaq and others with an authentic chain). After writing this, I returned to (Al-Mustadrak) and saw that he narrated the hadith in (3/259) via Abd al-Razzaq: Ibn Juraij informed us from Nafi' from Abdullah bin Umar from Nu'aym al-Nahham with it similarly. He said: (Authentic). Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. I say: It is as they said, except that it contains the 'an'an [saying 'from'] of Ibn Juraij, and he is a Mudallis. (Note): The second narration of the first hadith indicates that the Mu'adhin deletes the two Hayya'alahs [Hayya 'ala as-salah/al-falah] and replaces them with: As-salatu fi ar-rihal. Some hadith scholars have held this view; Ibn Khuzaimah wrote a chapter on it followed by Ibn Hibban and then Al-Muhibb al-Tabari: Deletion of Hayya 'ala as-salah on the day of rain. This is what the hadith implies, were it not that it is not apparent, for the lifting [attribution] of that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was narrated. If its attribution is established, the Mu'adhin would have the choice between deleting them based on this hadith and affirming them based on other hadiths. And Allah knows best.",

I say: It is in (Al-Musnad) (6/185) like this: Ismail bin Umar told us, he said: Yunus bin Abi Ishaq told us from Al-Aswad bin Yazid who said: I said to Aisha, Mother of the Believers: At what time do you pray Witr? Perhaps she said: I do not pray Witr until they call Adhan, and they do not call Adhan until dawn breaks. She said: And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had two Mu'adhins: Bilal and Amr bin Umm Maktum. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: (If Amr calls Adhan, eat and drink, for he is a blind man. And if Bilal calls Adhan, withhold your hands, for Bilal does not call Adhan - he said thus - until morning comes). This is a chain whose narrators are all narrators of Muslim, except that it is disconnected between Yunus bin Abi Ishaq and Al-Aswad bin Yazid, for between their deaths is (84) years. Perhaps Yunus narrated it from his father from Al-Aswad, and the mention of his father fell from the printer or the narrator. This is supported by the fact that Al-Aswad bin Yazid is narrated from by Abu Ishaq [Yunus's father]. And Allah knows best. Then Al-Hafiz mentioned the way to reconcile this narration and what contradicts it as preceded, so refer to it. Fourth: From Ibn Mas'ud from him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: (Let not the Adhan of Bilal prevent one of you - or anyone of you - from his Suhoor, for he calls Adhan or calls at night to return the one standing in prayer among you and to alert the one sleeping among you. And it is not to say Al-Fajr or Al-Subh). And he gestured with his fingers and raised them up and lowered them down until he says like this. And",

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did likewise in Arafat and Muzdalifah. In it is the long hadith of Jabir describing his Hajj (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in which he said: So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed on until he came to Arafat and found the dome had been pitched for him at Namirah, so he dismounted there until the sun passed its zenith... He called Adhan then established prayer (Iqamah) and prayed Dhuhr, then established prayer and prayed Asr, and did not pray anything between them.

Fourth: From Salman, elevated: (If a man is in a desolate land and prayer time comes, let him perform ablution. If he does not find water, let him perform Tayammum. If he establishes prayer [Iqamah], two angels pray with him. And if he calls Adhan and establishes prayer, hosts of Allah's soldiers whom his two sides cannot see pray behind him). Narrated by Abd al-Razzaq and Abu Bakr bin Abi Shaybah from Mu'tamir bin Sulaiman al-Taimi from his father from Abu Uthman al-Nahdi from him with it. This is an authentic chain on the condition of the Six. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it (1/405) elevated and stopped (Mawquf), and preferred the stopped version. It is not hidden that it has the ruling of being elevated, especially since it has a witness mentioned in (Al-Talkhis) (3/145). See (Al-Targhib) (11/153).",

He said in (Sharh Muslim): (This is the correct famous view in our Madhhab and the Madhhab of others, that Adhan is prescribed for the solitary person).

It is as they said. Then Al-Tirmidhi said: (The practice is upon this according to the people of knowledge; they disliked that the Mu'adhin take a wage for Adhan and recommended for the Mu'adhin to seek reward from Allah in his Adhan). Some of them went to the view that it is not permissible, which is the school of Ibn Hazm (3/145-146). He said: (It is the saying of Abu Hanifa and others). It is a view of the Shafi'is; Sheikh Abu Hamid, Al-Qaffal, and others asserted it, and Al-Mahamili, Al-Baghawi, and others authenticated it as in (Al-Majmu') (3/127). He said: (Al-Awza'i, Abu Hanifa, Ahmad, and Ibn al-Mundhir said it). Al-Shawkani inclined to this in (Nayl al-Awtar), so refer to it (2/49-50).

I say: But regarding the establishment of this report from Ibn Umar there is doubt, because it revolves around Yahya al-Bakka, and he is weak as in (Al-Taqrib). More than one of the Imams weakened him, like Al-Nasa'i and Al-Daraqutni. Ibn Hibban said: (He narrates conundrums from trustworthy narrators; it is not permissible to use him as proof). Al-Dhahabi mentioned him in (Al-Mizan) then cited this report for him from Ibn Umar.

The Sixth: From Umar bin Al-Khattab with the meaning of the fourth Hadith, and it will come in [the chapter of] Zakat, if Allah the Exalted wills. Refer to: Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood, Al-Nasa'i, Al-Darimi, Al-Tahawi, and Ahmad. In the chapter, from Abu Mahdhurah in the Hadith of Adhan, he said: Then he, peace be upon him, called me when I finished the Adhan and gave me a pouch containing some silver. This has passed in Issue (4) of Adhan. It contains Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Malik bin Abi Mahdhurah, whose status is unknown as Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Talkhis). So using this Hadith as evidence in this chapter for the permissibility of taking wages absolutely is not good. First: Due to what you know of its weakness. Second: Because it does not involve asking for wages; rather, it involves giving without asking, and this is permissible as indicated by the Hadiths before it. Refer to Al-Shawkani. 12 - It is appropriate that the one who has the best voice and whose voice carries further should call Adhan. Regarding this are two Hadiths: The First: From Abdullah bin Zaid in the Hadith of Adhan, he said: When I woke up, I came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and informed him of what I saw.

You have known that Waki's narration from Al-A'mash is connected and has a Sahih chain; perhaps Al-Daraqutni did not come across it. What we are certain of is that Ibn Abi Laila heard this Hadith from a group of Companions whom he did not name, so sometimes he attributed it to them, sometimes he attributed it to the owner of the story who is Abdullah bin Zaid, and sometimes to some of its narrators from the Companions like Mu'adh. He used to do that even if he did not hear it from them directly, considering that he heard it attributed to them, so this Irsal (omission of link) does not harm then, as is obvious. Whoever wishes for more verification on that should refer to the commentary of Sheikh Ahmad Muhammad Shakir on the book (Usul Al-Ahkam) by Ibn Hazm.

Then he would call Adhan afterwards on the roof of the mosque, something having been raised for him above its roof. Muhammad bin Umar is Al-Waqidi: Weak.

Narrated by Ibn Majah and Al-Bayhaqi. Our companions argued with the authentic Hadith preceding that he did not rotate. As for the Hadith of Hajjaj, the answer to it is from several aspects: First: It is weak because Hajjaj is weak and a Mudallis (obfuscator), and the weak is not used as evidence. The Mudallis, if he says 'from' (an), is not used as evidence even if he were just and precise. The second answer: It contradicts the narration of the trustworthy narrators from Awn bin Abi Juhaifa from his father, so it must be rejected.

This meaning is probable, but the more likely view to me is that the meaning of 'La yakhram' is: He does not decrease nor delay from the time, which is the time of the sun's zenith. The evidence for this is the second part of the Hadith, for he says: That Bilal used to delay the Iqamah until the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, came out. I found after that what supports this from the narration, which is what Al-Tayalisi narrated: Qais told us from Simak bin Harb from Jabir, he said: Bilal used to call Adhan when the sun declined (tadhad), and perhaps he delayed Iqamah a little and perhaps he hastened it a little. As for Adhan, he used not to omit/delay from the time. This is a text regarding what we preferred. And Allah knows best.

Narrated by Ahmad from Ibn Lahi'ah from Zaban from Sahl bin Mu'adh from his father. This is a chain that is acceptable in witnesses. Al-Tabarani narrated it in (Al-Kabir) as in (Al-Majma').

Al-Hafiz said: (It was argued for the majority with a Hadith extracted by Muslim and others that he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, heard a Mu'adhin; when he said Takbir, he said: (Upon the Fitrah). When he testified, he said: (Exited from the Fire). He said: Since he, peace and blessings be upon him, said other than what the Mu'adhin said, we knew that the command for that is for recommendation. It was critiqued that the Hadith does not state that he did not say like what he said; it is possible he said it and the narrator did not convey it, sufficing with the habit, and conveyed the extra saying. It is possible that this occurred before the issuance of the command. And it is possible that the man, when commanded, did not intend for himself to be within the generality of those addressed by that). I say: Perhaps among the arguments of the majority is what is in (Al-Muwatta) that the Companions, when the Mu'adhin started the Adhan on Friday, would start talking. It is very unlikely that answering is obligatory yet the Companions would turn away from it to talking. So refer to (Al-Muwatta). Similar to it is what Ibn Sa'd narrated from Musa bin Talha bin Ubaidullah, he said: I saw Uthman bin Affan while the Mu'adhin was calling Adhan, and he was talking to people, asking them and inquiring about prices and news.

It is the school of some Salaf as in (Sharh Al-Ma'ani) (86), acting upon his saying, peace be upon him: (So say like what he says). (2) To say like his saying except in the Haya'alah, so he says in their place: (La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah). This is the school of the majority Shafi'is and others, acting upon the detailed Hadith of Umar and Mu'awiyah. (3) To combine the Haya'alah and Hawqala. It is the school of some late Hanafis like Ibn Al-Humam and others, and it is a view among the Hanbalis. Al-Hafiz said: (Some later scholars reported from some people of Usul that if the Specific and General can be combined, it is obligatory to apply both). He said: (So why not say: It is recommended for the listener to combine the two Haya'alahs and the Hawqala, and it is a view among the Hanbalis). (4) To do Hawqala sometimes and Haya'alah sometimes. Ibn Hazm and some investigators from the late Hanafis said this. It is the truth, if Allah the Exalted wills, because it involves applying both the general and specific Hadiths, each within the limits of its meaning. As for combining them - as in the third school - it involves fabricating a meaning not stated by either the Specific or the General, as is obvious.

What is imagined that Haya'alah in answer to Haya'alah resembles mockery is nothing, because in the sum of words it is likewise if he intended mockery by it - and refuge is sought in Allah - otherwise they are words of goodness intended for sharing in the deed to attain the reward by it, for it is like a remedy for what he missed of the Adhan, so he must act according to his action to share in his reward). He said in the footnote after mentioning Ibn Al-Humam's speech on (Combining): (In summary, for about fifteen years I stood upon what Ibn Al-Humam, may Allah have mercy on him, verified, so I would combine them in answering the Adhan. Then it became verified to me that the intent of the Sharia is choice, not combining, and it is the Sunnah in the chapter of Adhkar. Combining is nothing but the opinion of Ibn Al-Humam and the Grand Sheikh).

Mentioned in (Fayd Al-Qadir) and he said: (Meaning he says at the testimony that there is no god but Allah: And I. And at Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasul Allah: And I). The Hadith has a witness from the narration of Abdullah bin Salam in (Al-Majma'). (Second: When he finishes answering, he sends blessings (Salah) upon the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, for whoever sends blessings upon him once, Allah sends blessings upon him ten times). It contains the Hadith of Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-Aas: That he heard the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saying: (If you hear the Mu'adhin, say like what he says, then send blessings upon me, for whoever sends blessings upon me once, Allah sends blessings upon him ten times. Then ask Allah for Al-Wasilah for me, for it is a station in Paradise that is not fitting except for a servant from the servants of Allah, and I hope that I am he. So whoever asks for Al-Wasilah for me, intercession becomes lawful for him). Muslim, Abu Dawood, Al-Nasa'i, and from him Ibn Al-Sunni...",

Then he cited his chain to Ka'b bin Ujrah, he said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, may Allah send blessings upon you, this Salam upon you we have known, so how is Salah upon you? He said: (Say: O Allah send blessings upon Muhammad...) The Hadith. Narrated by the Six and others, and it will come in [the chapter of] Prayer. Ibn Al-Sunni indicated by that that one should send blessings on the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, after Adhan with what is reported from him, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, of what he taught his Ummah.

He, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (And I hope that I am he, so whoever asks for Al-Wasilah for me, intercession becomes lawful for him). Regarding it is the Hadith of Abdullah bin Amr in Muslim and others, and it passed previously. In the chapter are other Hadiths: (1) From Abu Huraira, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (Ask Allah for Al-Wasilah for me). They said: O Messenger of Allah, what is Al-Wasilah? He said: (The highest degree in Paradise, attained only by one man, and I hope that I am he). Narrated by Al-Tirmidhi from Sufyan from Al-Layth - who is Ibn Abi Sulaym -: Ka'b told me: Abu Huraira told me. And he said: (This is a Gharib Hadith, its chain is not strong, and Ka'b is not known, and we do not know anyone who narrated from him other than Layth bin Abi Sulaym). From this aspect Ahmad narrated it as in Ibn Kathir and (Hadi Al-Arwah) with the wording: (If you send blessings upon me, ask Allah for Al-Wasilah for me...) And the rest is like it. (2) From Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri raised [to the Prophet]: (Al-Wasilah is a degree with Allah, there is no degree above it, so ask Allah to grant me Al-Wasilah). Narrated by Ahmad from the path of Ibn Lahi'ah from Musa bin Wardan from him. Likewise, Al-Tabarani narrated it in (Al-Awsat) and added at its end: (Over His creation). As in (Al-Majma').",

This is a strong corroboration for Ibn Lahi'ah indicating that he preserved the Hadith, so it is a good (Jayyid) chain. (3) From Ibn Abbas raised [to the Prophet]: (Ask Allah for Al-Wasilah for me, for no servant asks it for me in the world except that I will be a witness or intercessor for him on the Day of Resurrection). Narrated by Al-Tabarani in (Al-Awsat), and its chain is thus: Ahmad bin Ali Al-Abbar informed us: Al-Walid bin Abdul Malik Al-Harrani told us: Musa bin A'yun told us from Ibn Abi Dhi'b from Muhammad bin Amr bin Ata from him.

Then regarding the Hadith, Al-Tabarani said after citing it: (No one narrated it from Ibn Abi Dhi'b except Musa bin A'yun). Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir critiqued him saying: (Thus he said, and Ibn Mardawayh narrated it: Muhammad bin Ali bin Duhaym told us: Ahmad bin Hazim told us: Ubaydullah bin Musa told us: Musa bin Ubaidah told us from Muhammad bin Amr bin Ata, so he mentioned with his chain similar to it). (Benefit): (Since the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was the greatest of creation in servitude to his Lord, the most knowledgeable of them of Him, the most intense of them in fear of Him, and the greatest of them in love for Him, his station was the closest station to Allah, which is the highest degree in Paradise. The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered his Ummah to ask it for him so that they may attain by this supplication nearness to Allah and increase in faith. Also, Allah the Glorious decreed it for him through causes, among them is the supplication of his Ummah for him for it, due to what they attained at his hand of faith and guidance, blessings of Allah and His peace be upon him). Thus in (Hadi Al-Arwah) by Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him.

In this narration came: (Al-Maqam Al-Mahmud) with the definite article, and it is the narration of Al-Nasa'i, Al-Tabarani, and Al-Bayhaqi.

The wording of the others, except Al-Nasa'i and Al-Tirmidhi, is: (When the prayer becomes due, then call the Adhan...) etc. This is Al-Bukhari's wording. Abu Dawood added: And we were somewhat equal in knowledge that day. This is via Maslamah bin Muhammad from Khalid Al-Hadhdha from him, and this Maslamah is lenient in Hadith as in (Al-Taqrib). However, Abu Dawood and Ahmad narrated it via Isma'il bin Ulayyah from Khalid, who said: I said to Abu Qilabah: Then where is the Quran [memorization]? - and Ahmad said: The recitation - He said: They were close [in it]. Muslim narrated from Hafs from Khalid saying: They were close. And Muslim narrated from Hafs from Khalid saying: They were close in recitation. The wording of the others is: (If you two travel, then call the Adhan). Al-Tirmidhi said: (Hasan Sahih Hadith). It has been presented at length in the third issue of Adhan. In it is evidence for the obligation of Iqamah like Adhan, a communal obligation (Fard Kifayah); if one performs it, it falls off the other. The meaning of the Hadith is not its apparent literal sense, which is that each of them should call Adhan and Iqamah, as Al-Hafiz clarified in (Al-Fath). Rather, the meaning is: Whoever of you likes to call Adhan, let him call Adhan, and whoever likes to call Iqamah, let him call Iqamah, due to their equality in merit. Age is not considered in Adhan, unlike Imamate [leading prayer]. This meaning is supported by his saying in a narration of the Hadith: (Let one of you call Adhan for you), as preceded in [the chapter of] Adhan.",

    "text": "Scholars have differed regarding the ruling of Iqamah. Ibn Rushd said in (Al-Bidayah): (According to the jurists of the major cities regarding individuals and congregations, it is a confirmed Sunnah, more so than the Adhan. According to the literalists (Ahl al-Zahir), it is obligatory (Fard). I do not know if it is Fard according to them absolutely or a Fard among the obligations of the prayer. The difference between the two is that on the first view, the prayer is not invalidated by leaving it, and on the second, it is invalidated. Ibn Kinanah from the companions of Malik said: Whoever leaves it intentionally, his prayer is invalid). He said: (The apparent meaning of the Hadith of Malik bin Al-Huwayrith necessitates it being Fard, either in congregation or upon the individual). I say: This is the truth, that it is Fard in the congregation, not upon the individual, because the Hadith did not refer to him. Furthermore, the literalists differ on whether it is absolutely Fard or a Fard among the obligations of prayer, as Al-Nawawi mentioned from Al-Mahamili. Then Al-Nawawi mentioned that Dawud said: (It is Fard for the congregational prayer but not a condition for its validity). I say: As for Ibn Hazm, he explicitly stated that it is a condition for the validity of the prayer like the Adhan. His predecessors in this were Ata and Al-Awza'i, for they said: If one forgets the Iqamah, he repeats the prayer. This is not apparent. The correct view - as Sheikh al-Islam said in (Al-Ikhtiyarat) - is that it is a communal obligation, which is the apparent view of Ahmad's school and others. Ibn Al-Mundhir said: It is Fard regarding the congregation in residence and travel.",

Then he said: (Adhan and Iqamah are not binding on the individual; if he calls Adhan and Iqamah, it is good, because the text did not come mandating Adhan except upon two or more).

Al-Nasa'i dedicated a special chapter to this issue, saying: (Iqamah for the one who prays alone). Then he cited with his chain the Hadith of the one who prayed badly, saying: Ali bin Hajar informed us, he said: Isma'il informed us, he said: Yahya bin Ali bin Yahya bin Khallad bin Rifa'ah bin Rafi' Al-Zuraqi told us from his father from his grandfather from Rifa'ah bin Rafi': That the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was sitting in the row of prayer...

Al-Tirmidhi's statement after citing it: (Hasan Hadith) only refers to the core of the Hadith, not all the wordings mentioned in it. What indicates this to you is that a group of trustworthy narrators narrated the Hadith from Ali bin Yahya, the father of Yahya bin Ali bin Yahya, and none of them mentioned Iqamah in the Hadith. They are Dawud bin Qays, Muhammad bin Ajlan, Muhammad bin Amr, Ishaq bin Abdullah bin Abi Talhah, and Muhammad bin Ishaq; all five of them from Ali bin Yahya did not mention Iqamah as we mentioned.

Then I found the Hadith of this Yahya bin Ali bin Yahya in (Musnad Al-Tayalisi): Isma'il bin Ja'far Al-Madani told us, he said: Yahya bin Ali bin Khallad told me with it, except that he did not mention Iqamah.

Sufyan Al-Thawri, Ibn Al-Mubarak, and the people of Kufa say this). I say: Ibn Hazm expressed a strange view, going to the opinion that doubling the Iqamah is abrogated by the Hadith of Anas coming later: 'Bilal was ordered to make the Adhan even and the Iqamah odd.' There is no need for the claim of abrogation as long as it is possible to reconcile the doubling and the singling by interpreting this for some times and that for others.

The Shafi'is did the opposite; they took what is in it regarding repetition and left what is in it regarding doubling the Iqamah. Therefore, Al-Nawawi said: (We and the companions of Abu Hanifa have agreed that this Hadith of Abu Mahdhurah is not acted upon according to its literal meaning, because it contains repetition and doubling of Iqamah. They do not accept repetition, and we do not accept doubling of Iqamah. So we and they must interpret it. Adopting the singling [of Iqamah] was better because it agrees with the rest of the narrations and authentic Hadiths like the Hadith of Anas and others). I say: Al-Nawawi did not mention their interpretation of the Hadith, and it is not open to interpretation because it explicitly states that the words of Iqamah are seventeen words, while according to them they are eleven words as will come. Yes, Al-Nawawi and others mentioned from Al-Bayhaqi that he faulted the Hadith because Muslim narrated it in his (Sahih) as preceded without mentioning Iqamah, and due to other reasons he mentioned in (Nasb Al-Rayah) that do not scratch the authenticity of the Hadith at all. Ibn Daqiq Al-Eid refuted him sufficiently and held that the Hadith is authentic, so refer to Al-Zayla'i.

Then Al-Bayhaqi narrated from Ibn Khuzaimah who said: (Repetition in Adhan with doubling of Iqamah is of the type of permissible variation. It is permissible to repeat in Adhan and double the Iqamah, and it is permissible to double the Adhan and single the Iqamah, because both matters are authentic from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. As for doubling Adhan without repetition and doubling Iqamah, it is not established from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him). I say: There is something questionable in what Ibn Khuzaimah said, because the second Hadith - which is the Hadith of Abdullah ibn Zaid Al-Ansari regarding the dream - contains doubling of Iqamah and does not contain repetition by agreement. Therefore, Ibn Hazm went to the view that doubling is abrogated because it preceded singling as mentioned before. So how can it be said: That doubling Adhan without repetition along with doubling Iqamah is not established from him, peace and blessings be upon him? Especially since Ibn Khuzaimah is among those who narrated that as preceded in Adhan. Yes, it is problematic for this that the Hadith of the dream was narrated by Ibn Ishaq from the Hadith of Abdullah bin Zaid directly, and it does not contain the doubling of the entire Iqamah, rather its words are eleven words as preceded in the second issue of Adhan and will come after this. So one must then resort to preferring one of the two narrations over the first in terms of chain because the Hadith is one. The preferable one to me is the narration of Abd al-Rahman bin Abi Layla due to it coming from authentic paths from him.

As for the Hadith of Ibn Umar and Anas, their apparent meaning indicates that the Iqamah is nine words, not eleven words. They answered about them that they are interpreted based on predominance (Taghlib). Al-Nawawi said in (Sharh Muslim): (If it is said: You have said that the chosen view held by the majority is that the Iqamah is eleven words, including Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar at the beginning and end, and this is doubling. The answer is that this, even if it is a form of doubling, relative to the Adhan it is singling. Therefore our companions said: It is recommended for the Mu'adhin to say every two Takbirs in one breath, so he says at the beginning of Adhan: Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar in one breath, then says: Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar in one breath). Al-Hafiz said: (This is only possible in the beginning of Adhan, not in the Takbir at its end. According to what Al-Nawawi said, the Mu'adhin should single out each Takbir of the two at its end with a breath). This, and Malik went, as in (Al-Mudawwanah), to the view that the Iqamah is ten words, so he did not double the phrase: (Qad qamat is-salah). This is an old view of Al-Shafi'i as Al-Nawawi said. I did not find a chain for this view from the narrations; rather all of them are contrary to it because they state the doubling of Iqamah [phrase]. Perhaps whoever adopted it did so based on the practice of the people of Medina, and Ibn Hazm's speech indicates this. Then I saw Malik explicitly state that in (Al-Muwatta).",

(4 - Upon the one who hears the Iqamah is the like of what is upon the one who hears the Adhan, of responding, sending blessings upon the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and asking for Wasilah for him, as preceded in explanation in Issue (14) of Adhan. This is due to the generality of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (If you hear the Mu'adhin, say like what he says...) The Hadith. And because Iqamah is an Adhan linguistically and also legally due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (Between every two Adhans is a prayer), meaning Adhan and Iqamah). Al-Hafiz said in the explanation of the Hadith: Meaning Adhan and Iqamah. He said: (The commentators concurred that this is from the chapter of Taghlib [predominance] like saying: The two moons for the sun and moon. And it is possible that Iqamah was called Adhan because it is an announcement of the presence of the prayer action just as the Adhan is an announcement of the entry of the time. There is no hindrance to interpreting his saying: (two Adhans) on its apparent meaning). Imam Ibn Hazm proceeded on this, for he understood from his saying, peace be upon him: (When the prayer becomes due, let one of you call Adhan for you...) The Hadith which passed, he understood from it that Iqamah is included in this command based on the evidence of the Hadith we are discussing.

Ibn Sayyid Al-Nas narrated that in (Uyun Al-Athar) from Yahya bin Ma'in, and attributed it in (Fath Al-Mughib) to Abu Bakr bin Al-Arabi. The scholar Jamal Al-Din Al-Qasimi said in (Qawa'id Al-Tahdith fi Mustalah Al-Hadith): (And the apparent view is that the Madhhab of Al-Bukhari and Muslim is that as well; Al-Bukhari's condition in his (Sahih) indicates it, and Imam Muslim's denunciation of narrators of weak [Hadith] agreed upon as weak, as we mentioned. This is the Madhhab of Ibn Hazm, may Allah have mercy on him, also, as he said in (Al-Milal wal-Nihal). Refer to his words there. And in (Al-Muhalla) as well. Added here are the conditions mentioned by Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar in (Tabyin Al-Ajab fima Warada fi Fadl Rajab). What I believe and hold as religion before Allah is that the truth in this issue is with the scholars who went to abandoning action upon weak Hadith in virtuous deeds, for several reasons: First: That weak Hadith only yields conjecture (Dhann) by agreement, and acting upon conjecture is not permissible due to His saying, Exalted is He: {They follow not except assumption, and indeed, assumption avails not against the truth at all} [Al-Najm / 28] and his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the falsest of speech). Second: That the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, ordered us to avoid narrating from him except what we know to be authentic from him, saying: (Beware of narrating from me except what you know). It is known that narrating Hadith is only a means to act upon what is established in it. So if he, peace and blessings be upon him, forbids us from narrating what is not established from him, then it is more appropriate that he forbids acting upon it. This is plain and clear.",

This Hadith is from the narration of Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him.

This is an authentic chain; its narrators are narrators of Muslim except Ibn Lahi'ah, who is trustworthy but feared for poor memory, and he has been followed in this, indicating he preserved it.

This is also an authentic chain; its narrators are narrators of the Sahih except this Fahd, who is Ibn Sulaiman bin Yahya. Ibn Yunus said: (He was trustworthy, firm). Mentioned in (Kashf Al-Astar an Rijal Ma'ani Al-Athar) by Rashid Allah Shah Al-Sindi. They differed regarding Ayyash bin Abbas; Ibn Lahi'ah said: From him from Abu Tamim.

    "text": "the prayer is established. The clarification of that will come in its place, Allah willing. I found a third path for the Hadith extracted by Al-Khatib via Ahmed bin Bashar Al-Sayrafi: Abu Hafs Al-Abdi told us: Ayyub told us from Abu Qilabah from Sulaiman bin Bashar from Abu Hurairah elevated with it. This Ahmad narrated from a group and a group narrated from him; Al-Khatib wrote his biography and cited this Hadith for him and did not mention any criticism or praise. Abu Hafs Al-Abdi I did not know, unless he is Umar bin Hafs Al-Abdi or Hafs, but this one is of an earlier layer narrating from Thabit; if he is this one, he is flimsy (Wahin) as Al-Dhahabi said. Sulaiman bin Bashar I did not find; among the narrators of this layer is Sulaiman bin Bishr from the narrators of Ahmad in (Al-Ta'jil) and trustworthy according to Ibn Hibban. The Hadith is evidence that it is not permissible to enter into voluntary prayer for one who hears the Iqamah, whether it is the Sunnah of Fajr or otherwise. This is the school of the majority of scholars. Al-Tirmidhi said: (The practice is upon this according to some people of knowledge from the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and others: if the prayer is established, a man should not pray except the obligatory one. Sufyan Al-Thawri, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq say this). Perhaps further elaboration on this issue will come in the place referred to just now.",

I suspect that this Salih was mistaken in his narration of this Hadith with this text, for a group of trustworthy narrators narrated it from Isra'il with this chain from Jabir saying: The Mu'adhin of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to call Adhan then wait and not call Iqamah until he saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, had come out; he would establish prayer when he saw him. It preceded in the fourth issue. This is the origin of the Hadith of Jabir bin Samurah, so it got mixed up for this Salih or someone else with the mentioned Hadith of Abu Qatadah, so he narrated it with this chain. This is what appeared to me in this station. As for Al-Haythami, he said in (Al-Majma'): (Al-Tabarani narrated it in (Al-Awsat) and (Al-Saghir) and its chain is good). Thus he said, and Allah knows best. In the Hadith is evidence that people should not stand for prayer until they see the Imam in the mosque. The majority of scholars have taken this view as will come. Al-Tirmidhi said after citing the Hadith: (Some people of knowledge from the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and others disliked that people wait for the Imam while standing. Some of them said: If the Imam is in the mosque and the prayer is established, they only stand when the Mu'adhin says: Qad qamat is-salah Qad qamat is-salah. This is the saying of Ibn Al-Mubarak).

From Anas that he used to stand if the Mu'adhin said: Qad qamat is-salah; Ibn Al-Mundhir and others narrated it. Likewise Sa'id bin Mansur narrated it via Abu Ishaq from the companions of Abdullah. From Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib, he said: If the Mu'adhin says: Allahu Akbar, standing becomes obligatory. If he says: Hayya 'ala as-salah, the rows are straightened. If he says La ilaha illa Allah, the Imam says Takbir. From Abu Hanifa: They stand if he says: Hayya 'ala al-falah; if he says: Qad qamat is-salah, the Imam says Takbir.

This contradicts the Hadith of Jabir bin Samurah that Bilal would not establish prayer until the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, came out. Extracted by Muslim (1). They are reconciled by saying that Bilal used to watch for the exit of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him; as soon as he saw him, he would start the Iqamah before most people saw him. Then when they saw him, they stood, so he would not stand in his place until their rows were straightened).

As for the Hadith of Abu Hurairah coming shortly with the wording: The prayer was established, so the people straightened their rows, then the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, came out.

This is reconciled with the Hadith of Abu Qatadah by saying that this perhaps occurred to show permissibility, and that their action in the Hadith of Abu Hurairah was the cause of the prohibition of that in the Hadith of Abu Qatadah, and that they used to stand the moment prayer was established even if the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, had not come out, so he forbade them from that",

In the Hadith is the emphasized recommendation to come to prayer with tranquility and dignity, and the prohibition of coming to it running, whether in Jumu'ah prayer or others, whether one fears missing the opening Takbir or not. Thus in (Sharh Muslim) by Al-Nawawi. Al-Tirmidhi said: (The people of knowledge differed regarding walking to the mosque. Some of them saw rushing if one fears missing the first Takbir, to the extent that it was mentioned about some of them that they used to jog to prayer. Others disliked rushing and chose that one walk with deliberation and dignity. Ahmad and Ishaq say this, and they said: The practice is on the Hadith of Abu Hurairah.

Ibn Al-Mundhir narrated it from Zaid bin Thabit, Anas, Ahmad, and Abu Thawr, and Ibn Al-Mundhir chose it. Al-Abdari narrated it from most scholars as in (Al-Majmu'). He mentioned in it a view of some Shafi'is - namely Abu Ishaq - like the view of Ishaq which Al-Tirmidhi cited. Al-Nawawi said: (It is very weak, contradicting the authentic Sunnah). Scholars said: The wisdom in coming to it with tranquility and the prohibition of running is: The one going to prayer is intending it and proceeding to it, so he should be disciplined with its etiquettes and in the most perfect of states. This is the meaning of his saying in the narration of Malik and others: (For one of you is in prayer as long as he is heading to prayer). His saying: (If the prayer is established) mentions Iqamah only to alert by it to other times, because if he forbade coming to it running during Iqamah despite fear of missing some of it, then before Iqamah is more worthy. He emphasized that by stating the reason, saying: (For one of you is in prayer as long as he is heading to prayer). This covers all times of coming to prayer. He emphasized that with another emphasis, saying: (Whatever you catch, pray, and whatever you miss, complete). So it contains alerting and emphasis lest someone imagine that the prohibition is only for one who does not fear missing part of the prayer, so he explicitly stated the prohibition even if whatever of the prayer is missed. He clarified what to do regarding what he missed. Scholars differed regarding what he missed of prayer: Is it the beginning of his prayer or the end of it?",

Al-Nawawi said: (One says 'Sa'aytu' in such or to such: if he went to it and worked in it. From it is His saying, Exalted is He: {And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives} [Al-Najm / 39].

It was used as evidence to refute those among the Hanafis who generalized that if the Mu'adhin says: Qad qamat is-salah, the Imam must say Takbir). In (Al-Majmu'): (Our Madhhab and the Madhhab of the majority of the people of Hijaz and others is: permissibility of speaking after Iqamah of prayer before Ihram, but it is better to leave it except for a need. Abu Hanifa and others from the Kufans disliked it whether the speech was long or short. The Iqamah is not repeated for that. Our evidence is these authentic Hadiths).

This narration is given precedence over the narration of Ibn Jubair and Ibn Malik because with it is an addition of knowledge, and the addition of a trustworthy narrator is accepted. Also, it agrees with the narration of Usamah bin Zaid and Jabir bin Abdullah which agree on two Iqamahs. Thus the narration of Ibn Umar agreeing with them is more worthy of acceptance and reliance. Al-Nawawi went to this in (Sharh Muslim), and Ibn Hazm preceded him to that, preferring the narration of Salim over its contrary. Ibn Hazm held this ruling - that he calls Iqamah for each prayer in combining, whether early or late - and it is the old saying of Al-Shafi'i and a narration from Ahmad.

Al-Tahawi explicitly stated all of that in his explanation and strengthened what he chose by analogy with combining Dhuhr and Asr at Arafat. Then he said: (And what we narrated from Jabir regarding this is more beloved to us because of what observation testifies for it). Al-Nawawi said in (Sharh Muslim): (This is the correct view of our Madhhab: that Adhan is recommended for the first of them and he performs Iqamah for each one, so he prays them with one Adhan and two Iqamahs. The Hadith of (one Iqamah) is interpreted as meaning each prayer has an Iqamah. This reconciliation is necessary between it and the first narration (meaning: from the Hadith of Ibn Umar) and between it also and the narration of Jabir). I say: It is strange that our scholars took the Hadith of Jabir regarding combining at Arafat with one Adhan and two Iqamahs and abandoned it regarding combining at Muzdalifah with one Adhan and two Iqamahs. This is among the wonders of Fiqh. No wonder Imam Al-Tahawi opposed them, followed by Sheikh Ibn Al-Humam then Abu Al-Hasanat Al-Laknawi in (Al-Ta'liq Al-Mumajjad), and they were correct.

He said in (Al-Bidayah): (The apparent view of Malik's school is that it is among the Sunan [recommended practices] of prayer), and this was the view taken by Ismail Al-Qadi as in (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi). This is a weak view, refuted by those explicit commands to cover the awrah, and prayer is more deserving of that, as is not hidden. From what we have mentioned, you know that Ibn Hazm's statement in Maratib Al-Ijma: (They agreed that covering the awrah in it [prayer] for one who is able to find a lawful garment to wear is a Fard [obligation]) is not correct in reporting this agreement. Furthermore, those who held its obligation in prayer made it a condition among the conditions for the validity of prayer; so whoever prays naked, his prayer is void according to them. Al-Nawawi said: (Some of Malik's companions said: Covering the awrah is a duty (Wajib) and not a condition; if one prays with it exposed, his prayer is valid whether he did so intentionally or out of forgetfulness).",

    "text": "I say: This is the truth, that it is a duty (Wajib) and not a condition, for conditionality requires evidence beyond a mere command, and we have not found any evidence for those who claim conditionality, except what Al-Nawawi mentioned where he said: (Our proof is that the obligation of covering is established by the hadith of Aisha: 'Allah does not accept the prayer of a menstruating woman except with a Khimar [head cover]'... and it will come. He said: 'And there is no difference between men and women by agreement'). This hadith, as you see, is specific to women, but Al-Nawawi analogized men to them, which is a corrupt analogy due to the clear difference between the awrah of a man and the awrah of a woman, as is obvious. Al-Shawkani argued well in this regard in (Al-Nayl); after mentioning the hadiths used by the majority to prove conditionality, he said: (The answer to these evidences is that their limit is to indicate obligation. As for conditionality, where the absence of the condition effects the absence of the conditioned, they are not suitable for deducing it, because a condition is a positive legal ruling that is not established by mere commands. Yes, one could argue for conditionality using the hadith of the chapter (meaning Aisha's hadith), but referencing that is not free from impurity. First, it is said: We deny that negating acceptance indicates conditionality, because acceptance has been negated for the prayer of a runaway slave, one who has alcohol in his belly, and one who visits a fortune teller, despite the validity [of the prayer] being established by consensus.",

    "text": "Secondly: The utmost this proves is that covering is a condition for the validity of a woman's prayer, which is more specific than the claim, and appending men to women is incorrect here due to the existence of a difference, which is the temptation (Fitnah) in the exposure of a woman, a meaning not found in the awrah of a man. Thirdly: The hadith of Sahl bin Sa'd in the two Sahihs, Abu Dawood, and Al-Nasa'i with the wording: The men used to pray with the Prophet (peace be upon him) tying their lower garments on their necks like children, and it was said to the women: Do not raise your heads until the men are seated upright. Abu Dawood added: Due to the tightness of the garments. This indicates the lack of obligation to cover [fully], let alone its conditionality. Fourthly: The hadith of Amr bin Salama, which states: 'I used to lead them in prayer while wearing a cloak that was split open; when I prostrated, it would retract from me.' In one narration: 'My posterior would emerge, so a woman from the tribe said: Will you not cover the posterior of your reciter from us...' The hadith was recorded by Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawood, and Al-Nasa'i. So the truth is that covering the awrah in prayer is obligatory only, like in all other states, not a condition whose omission necessitates invalidity. Those who argue against conditionality supported their claim with weak jurisprudential arguments, such as saying: 'If covering were a condition in prayer, it would be exclusive to it and would require intention.' The first is refuted by faith (Iman), as it is a condition for prayer but not exclusive to it. The second by facing the Qiblah, as it does not require intention. The third by the inability to recite and glorify, for one prays silently [in that case].) End of his words, may Allah have mercy on him.",

    "text": "(2 - It [the awrah] for a man is the two private parts [As-Saw'atan] only, and the previous evidences apply to them). That the two private parts are awrah is agreed upon by scholars, as stated in (Maratib Al-Ijma) by Ibn Hazm. In Al-Majmu: (The linguists said: It was named 'Awrah' because of the ugliness of its appearance and for lowering the gaze from it; it is taken from 'Al-Awar', which is deficiency, defect, and ugliness. From it is the blindness of one eye (Awar Al-Ain) and the ugly word (Al-Kalima Al-Awra)). There is no doubt that this meaning is realized only in the two private parts. As for other than them, such as the thigh, navel, and knee, this meaning is not clearly realized in them. Therefore, scholars differed regarding them. The truth is what we mentioned due to what follows: (As for the thigh, knee, and navel, they are not of the forbidden awrah because the Prophet (peace be upon him) intentionally exposed them on various occasions in the presence of people. If they were forbidden awrah, he would not have exposed them. Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was lying down in his house, exposing his thighs, and Abu Bakr asked for permission to enter, so he permitted him while remaining in that state. Then Umar asked for permission, and he permitted him while remaining like that, and he spoke. Then Uthman asked for permission, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) sat up and arranged his clothes, then he entered and spoke. When he left, Aisha said to him: Abu Bakr entered and you did not stir, then Uthman entered and you sat up and arranged your clothes? He said: 'Should I not be shy of one from whom the angels are shy?') This is a generic authentic hadith.",

The deduction from the first is apparent because it says that he (peace be upon him) uncovered his thighs intentionally. As for the hadith of Anas, the direction of deduction is also apparent based on Al-Bukhari's narration: 'Then he lifted the Izar.' Its meaning is that he did that intentionally as well, unless the narration of others: 'And the Izar became uncovered' is used to explain this, for their apparent meaning is that the Izar became uncovered by itself. However, Al-Hafiz said: (It is possible to deduce that the thigh is not awrah from the aspect of his continuing in that state, because even if its occurrence was permissible without intent, if it were awrah, he would not have been affirmed in that state due to the status of his infallibility (peace be upon him). And if it were assumed that this happened to demonstrate legislation for the non-choosing person, it would be possible, but it is questionable because clarification would have been required immediately after, as in the case of forgetfulness in prayer. Its context in Abu Awana and Al-Jawzaqi via Abdul Warith from Abdul Aziz is apparent in the continuation of that, and its wording is: 'So the Messenger of Allah galloped in the alley of Khybar, and my knee was touching the thigh of the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him), and I could see the whiteness of his thighs'). He said: (The apparent meaning of Anas's statement implies that the touching was without a barrier, and touching the awrah without a barrier is not permissible) (1). Ibn Hazm said: (So it is correct that the thigh is not awrah. If it were awrah, Allah Almighty would not have uncovered it from His Messenger (peace be upon him), the purified and infallible from the people, in the state of Prophethood and Messengership, nor would Anas bin Malik or others have seen it, while He the Exalted had protected him from uncovering the awrah during childhood...",

Abu Hanifa and Al-Shafi'i held that the thigh is awrah and used the hadith: (The thigh is awrah) as proof. They responded to Aisha's hadith with what is in Muslim's narration regarding the doubt whether the exposed part was the thigh or the shank. In Al-Majmu it says: (There is no indication in it that the thigh is not awrah because there is doubt about what was exposed). I say: We have explained that all other narrations in this story confirm with certainty that what was exposed was the thigh, so Muslim's narration must be interpreted based on them. Then Al-Nawawi said: (Our companions said: Even if certainty of thigh exposure were valid, we would interpret it to mean uncovering some of his garments, not all. They said: Also, it is a specific incident concerning a specific person, so it has no generality and is no proof). I say: The proof in it is from the aspect that this action is from our Prophet (peace be upon him) who is our example and model in everything except what is excluded by evidence, due to His saying: {Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example} [Al-Ahzab / 21]. And the evidence for specification is not valid as will come, so the evidence of following him (peace be upon him) in this regard remains general and inclusive for his Ummah, thus proving the requirement.

However, the hadith indicates the permissibility of uncovering from another perspective, which is his (peace be upon him) remaining in that state of exposure as previously mentioned from Al-Hafiz. Likewise, Anas's statement: 'And I could see the whiteness of his thighs' indicates that looking at the thigh was not forbidden to them; otherwise, Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) would not have looked at it. Since the matter is so, it indicates that it is not awrah, which is the desired conclusion. Thus, it is established by what we mentioned that all their objections to the two hadiths are invalid upon investigation. Furthermore, other hadiths have come in this chapter, though they are lesser than these two in indicating the requirement.

Recorded by Abu Dawood, Al-Tahawi, and Al-Hakim who authenticated it, and Al-Dhahabi agreed, and Ahmad from Abdul Rahman bin Abi Al-Zinad from his father from Kharijah bin Zaid from Zaid bin Thabit with it. Al-Bukhari suspended (Mu'allaq) this hadith in the chapter 'What is mentioned regarding the thigh', and he also suspended the aforementioned hadith of Anas in it, indicating thereby that the thigh is not awrah. Therefore, Sheikh Muhammad Anwar Al-Kashmiri said in (Faidh Al-Bari): (What appears from the action of the author [Al-Bukhari] may Allah be pleased with him is that he leaned towards the school of Malik may Allah be pleased with him, and interpreted the view of the Hanafis as precaution). As for the hadith: (The thigh is awrah), it is a weak hadith. Al-Bukhari indicated its weakness in his (Sahih) saying: It is mentioned from Ibn Abbas, Jarhad, and Muhammad bin Jahsh from the Prophet (peace be upon him): (The thigh is awrah). It is necessary here to speak extensively on the defects of this hadith so the reader may verify...",

    "text": "...that it is not strong enough to oppose those hadiths indicating that the thigh is not awrah. So we say: First: The hadith of Ibn Abbas: Narrated by Abu Yahya Al-Qattat from Mujahid from him, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (The thigh is awrah). Its defect is this Abu Yahya; his name is most famously Dinar, and he is weak as stated by Ibn Hazm in (Al-Muhalla) and Al-Hafiz in (Al-Fath). Recorded by Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Tahawi in (Sharh Al-Ma'ani), Al-Hakim, Al-Bayhaqi, and Ahmad, all from him. Second: The hadith of Jarhad: Its defect is Jahalah (being unknown) and Idtirab (disorder/inconsistency) leading to a lack of trust in it. Abu Dawood, Al-Tahawi in (Al-Mushkil), Al-Bayhaqi, Al-Tayalisi, and Ahmad recorded it via Malik from Abu Al-Nadr from Zur'ah bin Abdul Rahman bin Jarhad from his father from Jarhad. Al-Darimi and Al-Tahawi in (Sharh Al-Ma'ani) recorded it via Malik from Abu Al-Nadr from Zur'ah bin Abdul Rahman from his father raised (Marfu) to the Prophet. Thus making it from the Musnad of Abdul Rahman bin Jarhad. Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Hakim, and Ahmad recorded it via Sufyan bin Uyaynah from Abu Al-Nadr from Zur'ah bin Muslim bin Jarhad from his grandfather from Jarhad.",

This necessitates the weakness of the hadith because it indicates it was not preserved properly, as scholars mentioned in (Mustalah Al-Hadith).

I say: Ibn Al-Qattan also weakened it. In (Nasb Al-Rayah) by Al-Zayla'i, Ibn Al-Qattan said: (The hadith of Jarhad has two defects: Disorder leading to the loss of trust in it. That is because they differ regarding it; some say Zur'ah bin Abdul Rahman, some say Zur'ah bin Abdullah, and some say Zur'ah bin Muslim. Then among these, some say: From his father from the Prophet (peace be upon him), and some say: From his father from Jarhad from the Prophet (peace be upon him), and some say: Zur'ah from the family of Jarhad from Jarhad from the Prophet (peace be upon him). The second defect: That Zur'ah and his father are not known in status nor famous in narration). From this, you know that Al-Hakim's statement: (It is a hadith with a Sahih chain) is incorrect, even if Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Third: The hadith of Muhammad bin Jahsh.

So there is no contradiction between the two statements then. Even if we admitted that Ibn Jurayj's explicit statement of hearing from Habib is established, the hadith would still not be established thereby because the other defect still remains, which is the disconnection between Habib and Asim as previously quoted from the two Hafizs, Ibn Ma'in and Abu Hatim. Whether the intermediary between them is truly Amr bin Khalid Al-Wasiti or not, the hadith is disconnected (Munqati') and incorrect due to the ignorance of the intermediary between them. As for the objection of Professor Ahmad Muhammad Shakir in his commentary on the Musnad that the meeting between them is established (so how can we claim he didn't hear this hadith from him), this would only be valid if Habib bin Abi Thabit were not a Mudallis (one who obfuscates transmission). But since he is known for Tadlis, mere contemporaneity and established meeting are not sufficient; rather, the Mudallis must explicitly state his hearing from the one he narrated from for his narration to be valid and accepted. This is a matter agreed upon among scholars and is not hidden from the referenced Professor. I do not know how he went there to authenticate the connection based on mere contemporaneity despite his knowledge that it is conditional for that that the narrator not be a Mudallis (refer to the introduction of Sahih Muslim). Perhaps he did not recall at the time of writing that this Habib is a Mudallis, and Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Taqrib) that he is: (Trustworthy, a jurist, majestic, but was frequent in Irsaal and Tadlis).",

(Note): We specified the chapter in which Ibn Majah recorded the hadith in his (Sunan) contrary to our habit in what we write of Takhrij, because I saw the previously mentioned Professor saying in the Takhrij of the hadith: (It was attributed in 'Al-Muntaqa' and 'Dhakha'ir Al-Mawarith' and by Al-Mundhiri as quoted by the commentator of Abu Dawood and Ibn Hajar in Al-Talkhis to Ibn Majah; indeed, the author of 'Al-Dhakha'ir' specified that it is in the Book of Funerals, but I did not find it after a long search). In this chapter there is also a narration from Amr bin Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather. And it will come shortly. (And from Abu Musa that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was sitting in a place where there was water and had uncovered his knees or his knee. When Uthman entered, he covered them). Recorded by Al-Bukhari, Al-Tabarani, and Al-Bayhaqi via Sulaiman bin Harb: Narrated to us Hammad bin Zaid: Narrated to me Ali bin Al-Hakam and Asim Al-Ahwal: That they heard Abu Uthman narrating from Abu Musa with it. In the chapter, there are other hadiths: Among them from Abu Darda who said: I was sitting with the Prophet (peace be upon him) when Abu Bakr approached holding the hem of his garment so that his knees were exposed. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: (Your companion has had an adventure/dispute). He greeted and said: O Messenger of Allah, there was something between me and Ibn Al-Khattab, so I hastened against him then regretted it, so I asked him to forgive me but he refused, so I came to you. He said: (May Allah forgive you, O Abu Bakr (three times)). Then Umar regretted and came to Abu Bakr's house and asked: Is Abu Bakr there? They said: No. So he came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and greeted him, and the face of the Prophet (peace be upon him) began to change [in anger] until Abu Bakr felt fear, so he knelt on his knees and said: O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I was more unjust (twice). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: (Allah sent me to you and you said: You lied, but Abu Bakr said: He spoke the truth, and he supported me with himself and his wealth. Will you then leave my companion for me? (twice)). He was not harmed after that. Recorded by Al-Bukhari and Al-Tahawi in (Al-Mushkil) from him. And among them from Amr bin Al-Sharid from his father that the Prophet (peace be upon him) followed a man from Thaqif until he hurried after him and grabbed his garment saying: (Raise your Izar). The man uncovered his knees and said: O Messenger of Allah, I am Ahnaf (Hanaf: turning of the foot with toes towards the other foot) (and my knees knock together). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (All of Allah's creation is beautiful). He said: That man was never seen except with his Izar to the middle of his shanks until he died. Recorded by Ahmad who said: Narrated to us Ruh: Narrated to us Zakariya bin Ishaq: Narrated to us Ibrahim bin Maysarah: That he heard Amr bin Al-Sharid with it.

Al-Shawkani's statement: (Using the hadith as proof that the knee is not awrah is not complete because the uncovering was for the excuse of entering the water, and also covering it from Uthman implies it is awrah, and even if covering could be explained by other reasons, the utmost is probability) is rejected.",

This means he (peace be upon him) was sitting dangling his legs in the water. Therefore, what excuse is there for uncovering the knees if they were awrah? Was the Prophet (peace be upon him) not able to suffice with dangling the shanks without uncovering the awrah? What guides you to the meaning I went to is that Imam Ahmad recorded the hadith from another path from Abu Musa: That the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was in a garden in Medina on the Quff of the well (meaning: the ledge built around it) dangling his legs, and Abu Bakr knocked on the door... The hadith. Muslim narrated it similarly from a third path with the wording: He sat in the middle of its ledge and uncovered his shanks and dangled them into the well. There is no contradiction between this narration and Al-Bukhari's narration explicitly mentioning uncovering the knee, because it contains an addition from a trustworthy narrator and is accepted by agreement. Just as there is no contradiction between this narration of Al-Bukhari and the narration of Aisha and others explicitly mentioning uncovering the thigh for the same reason. This is assuming the story is one. But if they are multiple, there is no issue. As for the second: Covering it from Uthman was a special treatment from him (peace be upon him) for him (Uthman) due to his intense shyness, just as he (peace be upon him) covered his thighs from him as previously mentioned. That does not indicate at all that he covered it only because it is awrah. How could that be when he (peace and blessings be upon him) uncovered it in front of others besides Uthman, as is clear in the hadith of Aisha and others, and as is apparent...",

This is what appeared from the critique of Al-Shawkani's words. Even if we assume his words are correct, the evidence that the knee is not awrah is the second matter: That is Abu Bakr uncovering his knees, as well as Amr bin Zurara in his presence (peace be upon him), and he did not rebuke them. If it were awrah, he (peace be upon him) would have rebuked that, just as he rebuked Jarhad Al-Aslami when he passed by him while his thigh was exposed, saying: (peace be upon him): (Cover your thigh for the thigh is awrah) - if the hadith were authentic, but it is not authentic as previously explained in detail. So his silence (peace be upon him) regarding that indicates that the knee is not awrah. Therefore, Al-Hafiz said in the explanation of Abu Darda's hadith: (In it is that the knee is not awrah). There is a third proof: That Hamza (may Allah be pleased with him) raised his gaze to the knee of the Prophet (peace be upon him). In this—in addition to him (peace be upon him) uncovering it—is someone else looking at his knee. If it were awrah, Hamza nor anyone else would have been free to look at it, as Ibn Hazm said similarly regarding the navel as will come. So the truth is that these [proofs] stand for the knee not being awrah. This was stated by Al-Shafi'i. Al-Nawawi said: (It is the famous view of our school, and Malik and a group said it, and it is a narration from Ahmad. Abu Hanifa and Ata said: It is awrah).",

They differed regarding the awrah of a slave girl on many opinions that may be mentioned later; the most correct evidence is that she is like a free woman, with no difference between them. Al-Tahawi's action here in analogizing a free man and others to a slave girl regarding the knee being awrah completely resembles Al-Nawawi's analogy of a man to a woman regarding the invalidity of prayer with exposed awrah, and the rebuttal to it has passed sufficiently. Perhaps the author of (Al-Hidayah) and other jurists did not rely on Abu Musa's hadith because of the matters we mentioned, but rather argued with the hadith: (The knee is awrah). This, if authentic, would be clear evidence for them, but it is not authentic; rather, it is agreed upon to be weak. Al-Daraqutni recorded it via Al-Nadr bin Mansour Al-Fazari: Informed us Abu Al-Janub - his name is Uqba bin Alqama - said: I heard Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) saying... so he mentioned it raised (Marfu). Al-Zayla'i said in (Nasb Al-Rayah): (Our Sheikh Al-Dhahabi said in his 'Mizan': Al-Nadr bin Mansour is flimsy (Wah). Ibn Hibban said: He is not used as proof. And this Uqba bin Alqama was weakened by Al-Daraqutni and Abu Hatim Al-Razi. The author repeated it in 'Al-Karahiyah' from Abu Huraira, but we did not find it from him. In 'Al-Imam', Abu Hatim Al-Razi said: Uqba is weak in hadith, and Al-Nadr bin Mansour is unknown).",

When I wanted to consummate the marriage with Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), I agreed with a goldsmith from Bani Qaynuqa to travel with me so we could bring Idhkhir (lemon grass) which I wanted to sell to the goldsmiths and use [the money] for the wedding feast. While I was gathering equipment for my she-camel, such as saddles, sacks, and ropes, and my two she-camels were kneeling next to the room of a man from the Ansar, I returned after collecting what I collected, and found my two she-camels with their humps cut off and their flanks ripped open and their livers taken. I could not control my eyes [from tears] when I saw that sight of them. I said: Who did this? He said: Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib did it, and he is in this house among drinkers from the Ansar. I went until I entered upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) and Zaid bin Harithah was with him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) recognized in my face what I had encountered. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: What is wrong with you? I said: O Messenger of Allah, I have never seen the like of today; Hamza attacked my she-camels, cut off their humps, and ripped open their flanks, and there he is in a house with drinkers. The Prophet (peace be upon him) called for his cloak and put it on, then proceeded walking, and I and Zaid bin Harithah followed him until he came to the house where Hamza was. He asked for permission, and they permitted them. There were drinkers. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) began blaming Hamza for what he did. Hamza was intoxicated, his eyes red.

The obligation is supported by his (peace be upon him) prohibition of abandoning that, and prohibition implies unlawfulness (Tahrim). A group of the...",

    "text": "...Salaf (may Allah be pleased with them) held this view which we mentioned, including Imam Ahmad. The famous view from him is that if one prays with exposed shoulder while able to cover, his prayer is not valid, making it a condition. This is the school of Ibn Hazm in (Al-Muhalla). In a narration from Ahmad: His prayer is valid but he sins by omitting it. This is the truth, God willing. The majority - Malik, Abu Hanifa, Al-Shafi'i, and others - held that the prohibition is for dislike (Tanzih) and the command is for recommendation (Istihbab). So if one prays in one garment covering his awrah with nothing of it on his shoulder, his prayer is valid with dislike (Karahah), whether he was able to put something on his shoulder or not. Al-Nawawi said in (Sharh Muslim): (And the proof of the majority...) And in (Al-Majmu): (Our proof is the hadith of Jabir regarding his saying (peace be upon him): (Then wrap your waist with it). Al-Shafi'i used this as proof in (Al-Umm), and the Companions and others used it as proof. And Allah knows best). I say: This is something of endless wonder. His command (peace be upon him) to wrap the waist is only if the garment is tight/narrow as per the text of the hadith, whereas the majority say wrapping the waist is permissible even if the garment is wide. So how could Al-Nawawi and his predecessors justify taking the mere command to wrap the waist without paying attention to the condition with which the Prophet (peace be upon him) restricted it? The truth is that the hadith is decisive evidence for Ahmad's school and others, which is differentiating between wide and tight garments; wrapping (Iltihaf) is obligatory in the first case but not the second. Al-Bukhari leaned towards this...",

Here is an issue: Is it obligatory for one who has a tight Izar which he cannot wrap [over shoulders] to wear a wider one or wear a Rida over it if he has one to cover the upper part of his body? The apparent view to me is: Yes, it is obligatory upon him, contrary to Ibn Hazm where he said in (Al-Muhalla): (If it is tight, he wraps his waist with it and it suffices him, whether he has other clothes or not). I say: This is rigidity from him on the apparent meaning of the hadith without observing the intended meaning, which is covering the body. The Prophet (peace be upon him) confirmed this meaning by forbidding a man to pray in trousers without a Rida on him, as previously mentioned. And Allah knows best. As for the prayer of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a single garment, he prayed wrapped in it, as stated by a group of Companions, including Amr bin Abi Salamah, Umm Hani, and Jabir bin Abdullah in the two Sheikhs and others, Abu Saeed Al-Khudri in Muslim, Anas in Al-Tahawi, Kaysan in Ibn Majah, and many others.

Perhaps this statement of Ibn Masud is interpreted as applying when one has another garment, evidenced by his other hadith, which is what Abdullah bin Ahmad recorded in (Zawa'id Al-Musnad) via two paths from Abu Masud Al-Jariri from Abu Nadrah bin Baqiyyah who said: Ubayy bin Ka'b said: Prayer in a single garment is a Sunnah; we used to do it with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and we were not criticized. Ibn Masud said: That was when there was scarcity in clothes; but if Allah expands [provision], then prayer in two garments is purer. Its men are trustworthy men of Muslim.

Thus he added a man to the chain. Al-Hafiz said: (So it implies it could be from 'More in Connected Chains' (Mazid fi Muttasil al-Asanid) or that the explicit mention [of hearing] in Attaf's narration is an illusion; this is the aspect of 'consideration' in its chain. As for those who authenticated it, they relied on Al-Darawardi's narration and made Attaf's narration a witness for its connection). I say: Musa bin Ibrahim explicitly stated his hearing from Salama in Al-Darawardi's narration as well in Al-Hakim. Unlike Al-Tahawi's narration, for it is from Al-Darawardi from Musa bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim from Abu Salama. (And this Musa bin Muhammad is Musa bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al-Taimi Abu Muhammad Al-Madani, who is other than Musa bin Ibrahim; that Musa bin Ibrahim is weak). So Al-Tahawi narrated a Shadh (anomalous) narration, narrating it via Ibn Abi Qabilah from Al-Darawardi, and I do not know this Ibn Abi Qabilah right now. It has a Mursal and disconnected witness.

We said that this is the most correct opinion because of the consensus of everyone that every worshiper must cover his awrah in his prayer, and that a woman may uncover her face and hands in her prayer, and that she must cover the rest of her body besides that, except for what was narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he permitted her to show of her forearm up to about half. Since this is the case by the consensus of all of them, it became known thereby that she may show of her body what is not awrah, just as it is for men; because what is not awrah is not forbidden to expose. And if she is permitted to expose that, it is known that it is among what Allah the Exalted made an exception for by His saying: {except what appears thereof}, because all of that appears from her). Al-Qurtubi also leaned towards this opinion, for he mentioned in his (Tafsir) the saying of Ibn Atiyyah: (It appears to me, by the ruling of the wording of the verse, that the woman is commanded not to display and to strive to conceal whatever is adornment. The exception occurred regarding what appears by the necessity of movement in what is unavoidable, or fixing a matter, and the like. So {what appears} in this manner is what necessity leads to for women, and it is what is pardoned).

I say: This narration of Ja'far was recorded by Ibn Jarir via Abdul Razzaq from him, supported (Musnad) from Abu Al-Jawza, who said regarding the saying of Allah: {And We have known those who precede among you and We have known those who stay behind}.

    "text": "I say: This Mursal (hurried/disconnected) and Mawquf (stopped) narration does not, in my view, defect the first connected (Mawsul) and raised (Marfu') narration, because the narrator has additional knowledge, and accepting it is obligatory as established in the terminology [of Hadith]. Also, the wording of the Mursal narration indicates it is an independent narration from the raised one because it is very brief. It appears that when Abu Al-Jawza narrated the hadith as raised (Marfu'), he narrated it completely regarding the reason for the revelation of the verse, and when he mentioned the verse interpreting it, he narrated it briefly without raising it or attributing it to Ibn Abbas, even though he originally took it from him. Thus, it appears that the Mursal narration does not defect the connected narration. And Allah knows best. As for the statement of Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir in his (Tafsir): (This hadith contains severe Nakara [strangeness/deniability]), it is not conceded, because that 'some' who used to look from under his armpit could have been from the hypocrites or ignorant Bedouins; this is clear and not hidden. Therefore, there is no strangeness or problem. That is why we did not see anyone who extracted the hadith or mentioned it describe it with severe Nakara, not even Al-Hafiz Al-Dhahabi, known for his precise critique of texts; rather, he authenticated it as you learned. He is the one about whom Ibn Kathir says in his (Tarikh) when mentioning his death year: (The Sheikhs of Hadith and its memorizers ended with him, may Allah have mercy on him). The hadith is evidence that women used to pray behind the Prophet, peace be upon him, with uncovered faces.

    "text": "the Fajr prayer with the Prophet, peace be upon him, wrapped in their woolen garments, then they would return to their homes when they finished the prayer; no one would recognize them due to the darkness. Recorded by the two Sheikhs and others, and it passed in the Timings No. (5) regarding Fajr. Its implication is that they would be recognized if it weren't for the darkness, and they are usually not recognized except by faces. So it contains evidence that the woman's face is not awrah in prayer, which is a consensus as indicated by Ibn Jarir's previous words in interpreting the verse. If the matter is so, then her face is not awrah outside of prayer a fortiori, because scholars agree that what is required in prayer is [often] what is not required outside of it. So if the permissibility of a matter inside it is established in the Law, that is evidence for its permissibility outside it, as is not hidden. Furthermore, explicit evidence has come that it is not awrah outside of prayer as well, which is our saying: (2) From Jabir bin Abdullah who said: I witnessed the prayer with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, on the day of Eid. He started with the prayer before the sermon, without Adhan or Iqamah. Then he stood leaning on Bilal, commanded the fear of Allah, urged obedience to Him, preached to the people and reminded them. Then he moved on until he came to the women, preached to them and reminded them, saying: (Give charity, for most of you are fuel for Hell). A woman from the middle class/status (Sita) of women with dark cheeks stood up and said: Why, O Messenger of Allah? He said: (Because you complain frequently and are ungrateful to the husband). He said: So they began giving charity from their jewelry, throwing their earrings and rings into Bilal's garment).",

Thus it is in Muslim. The narration of the others is: (Sifla) [meaning lowest/lower class]. Perhaps that narration is distorted or misspelled from this one. Al-Nawawi said in (Sharh Muslim): (Thus it is in the copies (Sita) with a Kasra on the Sin and a Fatha on the lightened Ta. In some copies: Wasita [middle] of women. Al-Qadi said: It means among the best of them; 'Al-Wast' is the just and the best. He said: The skillful among our Sheikhs claimed that this letter is changed in the book of Muslim and that its correct form is: From the 'Sifla' [lowest] of women. Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated it likewise in his (Musnad) and Al-Nasa'i in his (Sunan). In a narration of Ibn Abi Shaybah: A woman not from the elite of women. This is contrary to the first interpretation and is supported by his saying after it: 'Dark in the cheeks'). This is the speech of Al-Qadi. This claim of changing the word is not accepted; rather it is correct, but it does not mean 'from the best of women' as he interpreted, but rather 'a woman from the middle of the women', sitting in their midst. Al-Jawhari and others of the linguists said: 'Wasattu al-qawm, asituhum, wastan wa sitatan', meaning: I sat in their midst. His saying: (Saf'aa al-khadayn) [dark/changed cheeks] with a Fatha on the un-dotted Sin means: There is a change and blackness in them). End of Al-Nawawi's speech. This hadith indicates that women used to attend prayer with uncovered faces; that is why the narrator was able to describe one of them as having dark cheeks.",

This is a good (Jayyid) chain; its men are trustworthy. Al-Tirmidhi said: (Hasan Sahih). The hadith contains clear evidence that the woman's face is not awrah because (If the face were awrah that must be covered, he, peace be upon him, would not have approved her uncovering it in the presence of people, and would have ordered her to draw [a veil] over it from above. And if her face were covered, Ibn Abbas would not have known if she was beautiful or ugly). This was stated by Ibn Hazm. Thus, it is established by all of this that her face is not awrah, neither in prayer nor outside of it. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars in (Bidayat Al-Mujtahid), and it is the school of the three Imams: Abu Hanifa, Malik, Al-Shafi'i, and others as in (Al-Majmu). Some jurists argued for this by observation as well, which is that need calls for exposing the face for buying and selling, and exposing the palm for taking and giving; so that was not made awrah.",

He said: (Why do you not wear the Qibtiyyah?) I said: I clothed my wife with it. He said: (Order her to place a slip (Ghalalah) under it, for I fear it may describe the size of her bones).

In it: That Dihyah himself was given the Qibtiyyah by the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and he, peace be upon him, said to him: (Make a shirt from a part of it, and give your wife a part to use as a veil). When he turned away, he called him and said: (Order her to place something under it so it does not describe [her shape]). Perhaps it is another story.

Al-Bayhaqi said: (Abdullah bin Lahi'ah narrated it from Musa bin Jubair that Ubaidullah bin Abbas narrated to him). I say: The hadith of Ibn Lahi'ah was recorded in his (Sunan), and he said after it: (Yahya bin Ayyub narrated it saying Abbas bin Ubaidullah bin Abbas), which is the correct version as Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Taqrib). He said: (He is acceptable (Maqbul), and the narrator from him, Musa bin Jubair, is hidden (Mastur)). So the hadith with this chain is weak, but it is strengthened by the one before it.

This is to cover their feet due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (Whoever drags his garment out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection).

The most likely correct in my view are the last two narrations. As for the first of the two [latter ones], it is due to the agreement of three trustworthy narrators on it: Ayyub bin Musa, Abu Bakr bin Nafi, and Muhammad bin Ishaq. As for the other, its narrator from Nafi is Ubaidullah bin Umar, who is trustworthy and firm (Thabt). Ahmad bin Salih prioritized him over Malik regarding Nafi, as Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Taqrib).

    "text": "the first hadith: Whoever drags his garment... etc., is from the narration of Nafi from Ibn Umar. While the other hadith, he explicitly stated that its narrators are Nafi from Sulaiman bin Yasar from her. The narration of Ayyub is summarized without this detail. Al-Umari's following of him does not strengthen it because he is weak in memory—he is Abdullah bin Umar 'The Elder'—especially since his brother Ubaidullah 'The Younger', the trustworthy and firm one, contradicted him. Then I found evidence that Ayyub's narration was also reported in detail. Imam Ahmad said: Narrated to us Ismail: Informed us Ayyub from Nafi from Ibn Umar who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: (Indeed, the one who drags his garment...). The hadith. Nafi said: So I was informed that Umm Salama said... The hadith. So this Ismail—who is Ibn Ibrahim bin Ulayyah, the trustworthy Hafiz—clarifies also that Ayyub's narration is like Ubaidullah's narration regarding detail, except that he named the intermediary which Ayyub left obscure, and this is a definitely accepted addition. What appears is that all these narrations are authentic, and that Nafi sometimes sent the hadith [Mursal] and sometimes connected it, and that he had two Sheikhs in it: Sulaiman bin Yasar, who is a virtuous trustworthy narrator and one of the seven jurists used as proof by the two Sheikhs; and Safiyyah bint Abi Ubaid, who is trustworthy from the narrators of Muslim, and she is the wife of Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him. The hadith has another path from Ibn Umar recorded by Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, and Ahmad via Zaid Al-Ammi from Abu Al-Siddiq Al-Naji from Ibn Umar who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, granted a concession to the Mothers of the Believers regarding the hem for a handspan.

Know that there is no difference in this between a free woman and a slave woman due to the lack of evidence for a difference. Yes, some hadiths came regarding the difference, but they have weak chains and do not constitute proof. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar explained their weakness in (Al-Talkhis), so whoever wishes may check them. How excellent is what Ibn Hazm, may Allah have mercy on him, said: (As for the difference between the free woman and the slave woman, the religion of Allah is one, and creation and nature are one. So all of that applies equally to free women and slave women, unless a text comes differentiating between them in something, then one stops at it). Then he said: (And no two people of Islam differed that the prohibition of adultery with a free woman is like the prohibition with a slave woman, and that the Hadd punishment on the fornicator with a free woman is like the Hadd on the fornicator with a slave woman, with no difference. And that the exposure of a free woman to prohibition is like the exposure of a slave woman, with no difference.

Ibn Kathir held that the verse might include the opinions he mentioned, including this opinion rejected by Ibn Hazm, meaning purification of the heart. He said: (For the Arabs apply 'Thiyab' to it). Ibn Hazm did not deny this; rather, he denied limiting the verse to the heart. Ibn Al-Qayyim went to what Ibn Kathir held, and perhaps they took it from their Sheikh Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him. Ibn Al-Qayyim said in (Ighathat Al-Lahfan) - after citing the referenced opinions -: (I say: The verse encompasses all of this - and indicates it by way of alert and implication even if it doesn't cover that literally. For if the command is purification of the heart, then purification of the garment and the goodness of its earning are a completion of that. For the filth of the clothing earns the heart a filthy state, just as filth of food earns it that. Therefore, wearing skins of leopards and predatory beasts was forbidden by the Prophet's prohibition, peace be upon him, in several authentic hadiths with no contradiction, because of the state resembling those animals that the heart acquires.

    "text": "forgetfully, it [the prayer] is valid; this is an old saying of Al-Shafi'i. The second: The prayer is invalid whether he knew, was ignorant, or forgot. The third: The prayer is valid with the impurity even if he was aware and deliberate, and removing it is a Sunnah. Our companions reported from Ibn Abbas and Sa'id bin Jubair something similar). Then Al-Nawawi argued for the view of the majority with the previously mentioned verse and the commands mentioned in the preceding Hadiths. It is not hidden that the utmost these commands imply is obligation (Wujub), and obligation does not necessitate conditionality (Shartiyyah). This is because something being a condition is a declarative legal ruling (Hukm Shar'i Wad'i) that is not established except by the Lawgiver's explicit statement that it is a condition, or by suspending the action upon it using a conditional particle, or by negating the action without it (1) a negation directed at validity, not perfection, or by negating the reward. It is not established merely by the command for it, as Al-Shawkani, may Allah have mercy on him, said. So the truth is that removing impurity is not a condition for the validity of prayer—which is Al-Shafi'i's saying in the old [school]—but rather it is obligatory due to these commands, and the one who opposes it sins. So whoever prays while there is impurity on his body or garment has abandoned an obligation, but as for his prayer being void as is the case with the loss of a condition of validity, then no, based on what you have known. The Hadith of Abu Sa'id coming next indicates this.",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) Then some brothers noted that the Hadith of Ibn Samurah contains a negation of the action, meaning leaving the prayer if he sees something, and thus establishing the conditionality of the purity of the garment becomes necessary.

For it is authentic from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he prayed one day, and when he was in part of his prayer, he removed his sandals and placed them to his left. When the people saw that, they removed their sandals. When he finished his prayer, he said: 'What is the matter with you that you cast off your sandals?' They said: 'We saw you cast off your sandals, so we cast off our sandals.' The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Indeed Jibril came to me and informed me that there was filth - or he said: harm, and in a narration: impurity - in them, so I cast them off. So when one of you comes to the mosque, let him look at his sandals; if he sees filth - or he said: harm, and in a narration: impurity - in them, let him wipe them and pray in them.') It is from the Hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, led us in prayer one day... etc. It was extracted by Abu Dawood, Al-Darimi, Al-Hakim, and Al-Bayhaqi, as well as Al-Tahawi in (Sharh al-Ma'ani), Al-Tayalisi, and Ahmad, and the context belongs to him.

And from Abdur-Razzaq: Ma'mar informed us from Al-Zuhri from Salim that while Ibn Umar was praying, he saw blood on his garment, so he left, signaled to them, they brought him water, he washed it, then completed what remained based on what had passed of his prayer and did not repeat. I say: This is the choice of Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him. He said in (Chapter on Avoiding Impurity) from (Al-Ikhtiyarat Al-Ilmiyyah): (Whoever prays with impurity forgetfully or ignorantly, there is no repetition upon him.

Al-Nawawi attributed the saying of this to the majority of scholars, then said in (Al-Majmu'): (Ibn al-Mundhir said: And I say this, and it is the school of Rabi'ah and Malik, and it is strong in evidence, and it is the chosen view). If what we went to is correct, the Hadith is evidence that removing impurity is not a condition for the validity of prayer, because he, peace and blessings be upon him, built upon what he had prayed before taking off [the sandals]. If it were a condition, he would have restarted the prayer, because the absence of the condition affects the absence of the conditioned, as established in the principles (Usul). Al-Shawkani said: (Those who say that removing impurity is one of the conditions for the validity of prayer used the Hadith as evidence, but it is as we informed you: against them, not for them. Because his continuation of the prayer he prayed before removing the sandals and not restarting it indicates that purity is not a condition. The majority answered this by saying that the intended meaning of 'filth' (Qadhar) is something repulsive like mucus, spittle, and the like, and it does not necessitate that 'filth' be impure (Najis), and that it is possible it was a small amount of blood which is pardoned, and Jibril informing him of it was so his garments would not be soiled by something repulsive. This answer is refuted by what was said in (Al-Bari') in his interpretation of His saying, Exalted is He: {Or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself (Al-Gha'it)} [Al-Ma'idah / 6] that He used 'Gha'it' as a metonym for filth (Qadhar), and the statement of",

    "text": "Al-Azhari: 'Najis (impure) is the filth (Qadhar) exiting from the human body.' So making the repulsive thing non-impure or a pardoned impurity is arbitrary. Jibril's informing during the state of prayer about the filth is apparently because of the impurity in it which must be avoided in prayer, not for fear of soiling, because if it were for that, he would have informed him before entering prayer, since sitting while wearing them is a likely time for soiling by what is on them. Furthermore, such an answer is not possible regarding the narration of 'impurity' (Khabath) mentioned in the chapter, due to the agreement among linguistic Imams and others that 'Al-Khabathayn' (the two impurities) are urine and feces). Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, said in (Ighathat al-Lahfan) after citing the Hadith: (Interpreting that as referring to repulsive pure things like mucus or similar is incorrect for several reasons: First: That is not called 'Khabath'. Second: One is not ordered to wipe that for prayer, for it does not invalidate it. Third: Sandals are not removed in prayer [for that], for it is an action without need, so its lowest state is dislike (Karahah). Fourth: Al-Daraqutni narrated in his (Sunan) in the Hadith of removal from the narration of Ibn Abbas that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Indeed Jibril came to me and informed me that there was tick blood on them,' and 'Halam' are large ticks).",

For its implication is that he used to pray in the Shi'ar if nothing from her touched it. (Shi'ar): is the garment that the human makes touch his body (hair/skin). And (Dithar): is what he wears over the clothes, which is the quilt. More explicit than all this is her other Hadith; she said: I was with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and upon us was our Shi'ar, and we had cast a garment (Kisa') over it. When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, woke up, he took the Kisa' and wore it, then went out and prayed the Morning prayer. Then he sat, and a man said: O Messenger of Allah, this is a spot of blood. So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, grabbed what was around it and sent it to me bundled in the hand of the boy and said: ('Wash this and dry it, then send it back to me'). So I called for my vessel, washed it, dried it, and returned it to him. So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, came at midday while it was upon him). But it is from the narration of Umm Yunus bint Shaddad, who said: My mother-in-law Umm Jahdar al-Amiriyyah told me from her. And their condition is not known as in (Al-Taqrib). Al-Dhahabi said in (Al-Mizan): (I do not know among women anyone accused [of lying] or anyone they abandoned). The Hadith was extracted by Abu Dawood. It is explicit regarding his prayer, peace be upon him, in the Kisa' in which he and his wife were wrapped until it became clear to him that there was a spot of blood in it, so he ordered it washed and did not repeat the prayer because of it. For if he had repeated it, it would have been transmitted to us. So - if authentic - it is",

In summary, the Hadith of Aisha which we are discussing does not imply negating the Prophet's, peace and blessings be upon him, prayer in the quilts of women and their clothes absolutely; rather, the intended meaning is negating his, peace and blessings be upon him, *persistence* in that. This is what the collection of Hadiths reported on this subject and the method of reconciling them indicate. And Allah knows best. (Second: On a mount that has been affected by impurity, because the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, prayed on a donkey while heading to Khaybar [voluntarily]).

The addition between the brackets is Al-Thawri's.

He narrated a matter that is possible to occur, so it must be accepted. The narration of others from the trustworthy narrators using the word 'camel' does not contradict or oppose it due to the possibility that the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, rode on this one time and on that another time. I detailed the discussion on the authenticity of the Hadith and refuting its flaw in (Al-Ta'liqat Al-Jiyad 'ala Zad Al-Ma'ad), so let it be reviewed. The Hadith has a witness from the Hadith of Anas bin Malik: That he saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, praying on a donkey while riding to Khaybar, and the Qiblah was behind him. Extracted by Al-Nasa'i via Muhammad bin Ajlan from Yahya bin Sa'id from him. This is a Hasan chain; all its narrators are trustworthy except Ibn Ajlan, regarding whom there is some discussion, but he is Hasan in Hadith.

Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Al-Bayhaqi, and Ahmad extracted it from another path via Anas bin Sirin who said: We received Anas when he arrived from Sham, so we met him at Ain al-Tamr. I saw him praying on a donkey and his face was to that side - meaning to the left of the Qiblah - so I said: I saw you praying to other than the Qiblah? He said: Had I not seen the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, doing it, I would not have done it. Al-Bukhari wrote a chapter for it (Chapter: Voluntary Prayer on a Donkey). Ibn Rashid said: (His intent is that it is not a condition for voluntary prayer on an animal that its excrement be pure; rather, the ruling for riding beasts is one, provided he does not touch the impurity. Ibn Daqiq Al-Eid said: It is taken from this Hadith the purity of the donkey's sweat because avoiding touching it is impossible, especially if the riding time is long and sweat is probable). Thus in (Al-Fath) by Ibn Hajar. Then he said: (In this Hadith are benefits other than what passed: that whoever prays on a place containing impurity which he does not touch directly, his prayer is valid, because the animal is not free of impurity even if on its outlet).

This only holds based on the view that the donkey is essentially impure. Yes, it is valid to use it as evidence for the permissibility of praying on what contains impurity because the donkey is never free from being soiled by it). The Hadith also contains evidence for the permissibility of voluntary prayer on a riding beast, which is agreed upon, and the discussion will come in its place. (Third: In the two sandals, for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, prayed in them, and that has been transmitted via Tawatur (successive narration) from him. However, one must look at them before starting the prayer; if he sees filth, he rubs them on the ground then prays in them).

I have mentioned the Hadiths of those whose chain to him is established in our large book (Sifat Salat al-Nabi, peace and blessings be upon him). They are Anas bin Malik, Abu Hurairah, Aisha, Ibn Mas'ud, Abdullah bin al-Shikhkhir, Abdullah bin Amr, and Aws bin Abi Aws. Therefore, Imam Al-Tahawi explicitly stated that: (The reports are Mutawatir from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, regarding his prayer in his sandals).

But look at the state of the common Muslims now, even those who attribute themselves to knowledge: How they disapprove of one who prays in his sandals! Yet he was not ordered to take them off for prayer; rather he was ordered to look at them, and if there was harm in them, to rub them on the ground, and that is their purification. They were not ordered regarding them with other than that). Ibn al-Qayyim said in (Ighathat al-Lahfan min Maka'id al-Shaytan) summarized: (And among the things that the hearts of the whisperers [people with OCD] do not find comfort in: Prayer in sandals. Yet it is the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, by action from him and by command). Then he mentioned the Hadith of Anas and the Hadith of Shaddad bin Aws coming shortly, then said: (Imam Ahmad was asked: Does a man pray in his sandals? He said: Yes, by Allah.

Al-Daraqutni said in (Al-Ilal) as in (Al-Talkhis): Ja'far bin Muhammad the Mu'adhin - trustworthy - told us: Al-Sari bin Yahya told us: Abu Nu'aym and Qabisah told us: Sufyan told us from Amr bin Yahya from his father from Abu Sa'id connected. He said: (The Mursal is the preserved one). Thus he said. Even if that is correct specifically regarding Al-Thawri's narration, it is not correct in the narration of others. Therefore, the author of (Al-Imam) said: (The gist of what Mursal is faulted with, if the one connecting it is trustworthy, then it is accepted). Al-Hafiz said: (Ibn Dihyah erred grossly saying in his book (Al-Tanwir): This is not authentic from any path.",

Al-Baidawi said: (Since the Jews and Christians used to prostrate to the graves of their prophets out of glorification for their status and make them a Qiblah turning towards them in prayer, and they took them as idols - the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, cursed them and forbade the Muslims from the like of that). The Hadith, according to us, has a more general meaning than what Al-Baidawi mentioned, as will be clarified shortly, Allah willing. Among the wonders of understanding that clashes with the intent of the Hadith of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him - if we do not say with the text itself - is Al-Baidawi's statement at the end of his speech, which is: (As for the one who takes a mosque near a righteous person or prays in a graveyard intending by it to seek blessings from his spirit or the arrival of an effect from the effects of his worship to him, not glorification for him nor turning towards him, then there is no harm upon him).

Al-Munawi said after quoting this statement of his: (However, in the report of the two Sheikhs [Bukhari and Muslim], there is a dislike for building a mosque over graves absolutely, and the intended is the graves of Muslims, fearing that the graves would be worshipped in them, due to the context of the report: 'O Allah, do not make my grave an idol to be worshipped'). Imam Muhammad, the student of Abu Hanifa, explicitly stated the dislike of taking a mosque *near* a grave, as his text on that will come. The expression (near/at) is more general than his saying: (above) or (on), as is obvious. So whoever builds a mosque beside a righteous person has built it *near* him. Therefore, the words of Muhammad, may Allah have mercy on him, are a refutation of Al-Baidawi in this innovated opinion of his. Al-San'ani also refuted him in (Subul al-Salam), saying: (His saying: 'not for glorification for him', it is said: taking mosques near him and intending to seek blessings by him is glorification for him. Furthermore, the Hadiths of prohibition are absolute, and there is no evidence for the reasoning he mentioned. The apparent meaning is that the reason is blocking the means [to Shirk] and distancing from resembling the idol worshippers who glorify inanimate objects that neither benefit nor harm, and because spending money on that is futility and waste devoid of benefit entirely). He said: (The evils of what is built over graves, such as shrines and domes, cannot be counted). The first Hadith indicates the prohibition of prayer in the graveyard according to the mentioned detail, due to the generality of the Hadith and because prohibition primarily implies forbiddenness (Tahrim). Some went to the invalidity of prayer therein, which is probable, and Allah knows best. Ibn Hazm adopted this in (Al-Muhalla), and narrated from Ahmad that he said:",

Malik did not see any harm in that, and some of his imitators argued for him that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, prayed over the grave of the poor black woman). Ibn Hazm said: (This is strange indeed, that these people oppose this report in what came in it, so they do not permit the funeral prayer over one who has been buried, yet they deem permissible - with what has no trace or indication from Him - opposing the established Sunan). He said: (All these reports are truth, so prayer is not lawful where we mentioned except the funeral prayer, for it is prayed in the graveyard and on the grave whose owner has been buried, as the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, did. We forbid what he forbade, and we count it as closeness to Allah Almighty to do as he did. His command and prohibition are truth, and his action is truth, and whatever is other than that is falsehood, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds). Al-Shawkani said after recounting the schools of scholars on the issue: (The mutawatir [widely transmitted] Hadiths of prohibition, as that Imam [Ibn Hazm] said, do not fall short of indicating prohibition (Tahrim), which is the true meaning for it. It is established in the principles (Usul) that prohibition indicates the corruption (fasad) of the prohibited act. So the truth is prohibition and invalidity, because the corruption implied by prohibition is synonymous with invalidity, without differentiating between praying *on* the grave or [in] graveyards and everything to which the term graveyard applies).

A group of our companions mentioned that a graveyard is three graves or more, but there is no such distinction in the words of Ahmad and the generality of his companions. Rather, the generality of their words, their reasoning, and their evidence necessitate the prevention of prayer at a single grave among the graves, and this is the correct view. A 'Maqbara' (graveyard) is wherever burial takes place, not [necessarily] that it is the plural of grave. Our companions said: Everything included in the name of graveyard from what is around the graves, one does not pray in it. This determines that the prohibition encompasses the sanctity of the single grave and its courtyard added to it. Al-Amidi and others mentioned that prayer is not permissible in it, i.e., the mosque whose Qiblah is towards the grave, unless there is another barrier between the wall and the graveyard. Some mentioned: This is the explicit text of Ahmad). They differed regarding the cause (Illah) of the prohibition of prayer in a graveyard. It was said: Impurity. And it was said: Resemblance to the People of the Book and blocking the means to Shirk, as preceded in the words of Sheikh Al-Islam and others. This is what is apparent from the sum of Hadiths reported in this chapter. Some have passed and some will come. Our later scholars from the Hanafis proceeded upon this. Ibn Abidin said in his (Hashiyah): (They differed regarding its cause (meaning: the dislike). It was said: Because therein are the bones of the dead and their pus, which is impure. And there is a view regarding this (1). And it was said: Because the origin of idol worship is taking the graves of the righteous as mosques. And it was said: Because it is a resemblance to the Jews.

He, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (Allah's curse be upon the Jews and Christians; they took the graves of their prophets as mosques). Whether it [the grave] is above him, behind him, or under what he stands upon. The graves of the Prophets, peace be upon them, are excepted; prayer in them is not disliked absolutely, whether dug up or not, provided the grave is not in the direction of the Qiblah, because they are alive in their graves. Do you not see that the resting place of Ismail, peace be upon him, is in the Hijr under the water spout, and that between the Black Stone and Zamzam are the graves of seventy prophets? Furthermore, that mosque is the best place to seek for prayer, unlike the graves of others. Stated in (Sharh Al-Mishkat)). All this is the speech of Al-Tahtawi, and it is flawed speech that contradicts itself. For if he explicitly states and reasons the dislike with resemblance to the Jews and Christians - and they used to take the graves of their prophets as mosques - how can he except the graves of Prophets when resemblance to the disbelievers is realized by praying in them? Yes, perhaps this exception would be valid if the cause of dislike was impurity, due to the purity of their graves, peace be upon them.

He apparently quoted the correct reasoning from some scholars who cannot be imagined to allow the exception, then he quoted the exception from some who hold the other cause, which is impurity, and it is reported from them. What indicates this is his saying: (dug up or not), for this is only valid to be said based on holding the view of this outweighed cause. From it branches the saying of the difference between a dug-up graveyard and a non-dug-up one regarding other than the graves of Prophets. If what we went to is not the truth, then what is the meaning of this statement here? And what is the meaning of the exception that clashes with the text? It might be said: The text's meaning according to Al-Tahtawi is not general, but rather means facing [the grave], as previously mentioned from Al-Baidawi. His saying after the exception indicates this: (provided the grave is not in the direction of the Qiblah). So with this restriction, he did not clash with the text according to his understanding. So I say: But his saying is problematic for him: (Whether it was above him or behind him...) etc. He said that about the Hadith in a way that implies it is general to him.

Upon this [reasoning] came the detail mentioned by Al-Tahtawi in his saying: (Whether...) etc. He quoted it from the speech of Ibn Hajar - meaning Al-Haytami - and the text of his words regarding that is: (The commentator pointed out the problem of praying at the grave of Ismail, peace be upon him, while it is disliked in a graveyard. He answered that its place is a dug-up graveyard due to its impurity. All this is heedlessness of their saying: The graves of Prophets are excepted, so prayer in them is not disliked absolutely because they are alive in their graves. Even conceding [the argument], his answer is incorrect due to their explicit statement of the dislike of prayer in the graveyard of non-Prophets even if not dug up, because it is adjacent to impurity, and adjacency to it in prayer is disliked whether it is above him, behind him, or under what he is standing on). End of what is in (Al-Mirqat). As for what Al-Tahtawi argued, following the explanation of (Al-Mishkat), regarding the superiority of prayer at the grave of Ismail, peace be upon him, and the grave of the seventy prophets, Al-Qari himself answered it in the mentioned explanation by saying: (And in it is that the trace of the grave of Ismail and others is obliterated, so it is not valid to use it as evidence).

So does the presence of the Noble Grave in it now necessitate saying: The virtue of prayer in it is because of the Noble Grave? No! Only the ignorant commoners say that. Likewise, the virtue of prayer at the grave of Ismail and others does not imply that it is because of the graves.

For the grave of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, or a righteous man was not dug up, and a single grave has no impurity on it. He, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, alerted to the cause by saying: 'O Allah, do not make my grave an idol to be worshipped' and by his saying: 'Those before you used to take graves as mosques, so do not take them as mosques.' Those people used to take graves where there was no impurity. And because Muslim narrated in his (Sahih) from Abu Marthad Al-Ghanawi that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: 'Do not pray towards graves and do not sit on them.'

So he combined statues and graves. Also, Al-Lat was worshipped due to the glorification of the grave of a righteous man who was there). He said later, after mentioning the first cause: (This cause [impurity] has a dispute regarding its correctness due to the difference of scholars regarding the impurity of grave soil. It is from the issues of transformation (Istihala), and most Muslim scholars say: Impurity becomes pure by transformation. This is the school of Abu Hanifa, Ahl al-Zahir, and one of the two views in the school of Malik and Ahmad. It is established in the (Sahih) that the mosque of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was a garden for Banu Najjar containing graves of the polytheists, palm trees, and ruins. So the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered regarding the palm trees and they were cut, the ruins and they were leveled, and the graves and they were dug up. He placed the palm trees in the direction of the Qiblah. If the soil of graves were impure, the soil of the polytheists' graves would be impure, and the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, would have ordered the removal of that soil, for that soil must have mixed with other soil). Then he mentioned the second cause, then said: (This cause is correct by their agreement. Those who reasoned with the first - like Al-Shafi'i and others - also reasoned with this one and disliked it because of the Fitnah in it. Likewise, the Imams from the companions of Ahmad and Malik, like Abu Bakr Al-Athram the companion of Ahmad and others, reasoned with this second one as well, even if some of them might reason with the first. Allah the Exalted said: {And said, 'Never leave your gods and never leave Wadd or Suwa' or Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr. And already they have misled many.} [Nuh / 23-24].

It is known by self-evidence that the cursed Jews and Christians only built those mosques to pray in them. So whoever prays in a mosque containing a grave, even if he does not intend the grave, has resembled those upon whom is anger and the astray. We have been forbidden from resembling them in general and specific texts. Therefore, the scholar Ibn Al-Malik - who is from our Hanafi scholars - said in the explanation of the Hadith of Ibn Abbas mentioned previously: (Taking mosques over them was forbidden only because praying in them is following the Sunnah of the Jews). Quoted by Sheikh Ali Al-Qari in (Al-Mirqat). Added to the above is that prayer in mosques built on graves may lead its doer or the commoners and ignorant people who follow him to single out the dead with some acts of worship specific to Allah the Exalted, such as seeking aid (Istighatha) and prostration, as is happening in most mosques built on graves, and it is witnessed. So it was forbidden to block the means (Saddan Lil-Dhari'ah). It is like the prohibition of prayer in the three strictly disliked times; rather, the corruption in those mosques is clearer and more apparent than in these times, as reality bears witness. All this applies to one who did not intend prayer in those mosques. As for the one intending them for the sake of the grave's occupant, seeking blessings by him, believing that prayer near him is better than prayer in mosques devoid of graves, this is the essence of opposing and defying Allah and His Messenger. This prayer is worthy of the saying of those who said it is invalid, as will come from some scholars.",

So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, forbade taking this place for the worship of Allah alone lest that be taken as a means to what is forbidden, just as he forbade prayer in the three times due to the preponderant corruption in that, which is resembling the polytheists which leads to Shirk. There is not in the intent of prayer at those times... Therefore, scholars disputed regarding prayers with specific causes (dhawat al-asbab), so many of them permitted them in these times, and it is the more apparent of the two scholarly opinions. This is because if the prohibition is for blocking the means, it is permitted for a preponderant interest. Performing prayers with specific causes is needed in these times, and is missed if not done in them, so their interest is missed; thus they were permitted due to the preponderant interest in them. This is contrary to what has no cause, for it is possible to do it in other than these times, so no preponderant interest is missed by prohibiting it, and it contains corruption necessitating its prohibition. So if his prohibition of prayer in these times was to block the means to Shirk lest that leads to prostrating to the sun, supplicating to it, and asking it as the people of the call to the sun, moon, and stars do who supplicate to them and ask them - it was known that calling upon the sun and prostrating to it is forbidden in itself, greater in prohibition than the prayer which he forbade lest it leads to calling upon the stars.

Prayer in them is disliked without any disagreement I know of, and it is not valid according to us in the apparent view of the Madhhab due to the prohibition and curse reported regarding that, and due to other Hadiths. There is no disagreement in this issue due to the buried person being one. Our companions only differed regarding the graveyard devoid of a mosque: is it defined by three graves, or is prayer forbidden at a single grave even if there is no other grave near it? On two views.

Then he said:) The structure that is on the grave of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was closed and not entered until around the fourth century. It was said: Some women connected to the Caliphs saw a dream regarding that, so it was breached for that reason. And it was said: When the Christians took over these areas, they breached that. Then it was left as a mosque after the later conquests. The people of virtue among our sheikhs used to not pray in the totality of that structure and forbade their companions from praying in it, following the command of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and avoiding his disobedience as preceded). Then he said in it: (For his prohibition of taking graves as mosques implies the prohibition of building mosques on them and intending prayer near them.

Many of them explicitly stated the prohibition of that, and even the invalidity of prayer therein, although there is dispute regarding this [invalidity]. The intent here is that this is not obligatory nor recommended by their agreement; rather, it is disliked by their agreement). He said in (Al-Jawab Al-Bahir fi Zuwwar Al-Maqabir): (Prayer in mosques built on graves is forbidden absolutely, unlike his mosque, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, for prayer in it is worth a thousand prayers, as it was founded on piety. Its sanctity existed during his life, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and the life of his Rightly Guided Caliphs before the Chamber entered it). Then he said: (Whoever believes that before [the inclusion of] the grave there was no virtue in it, and that virtue only occurred for it during the Caliphate of Al-Walid when the Chamber was entered into it, he is ignorant, excessive in ignorance, or a disbeliever denying what he, peace be upon him, brought, deserving of being killed).

The reference for that is resemblance to the Jews and Christians in their praying in mosques built on graves, and the resemblance occurs in all the forms he mentioned, as is obvious.

The saying of 'dislike' is interpreted as other than that, for scholars are not thought to allow an action for which the doer was cursed in Mutawatir reports from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him.

Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman bin Abi Laila, I did not know him, and Al-Hafiz did not include him in (Al-Ta'jil) even though he meets his condition. Abbad bin Al-Awwam narrated it from Al-Hajjaj, he said: Abdullah bin Abdullah, the freed slave of Banu Hashim - and he was trustworthy and Al-Hakam used to take from him - told us from Abdul Rahman bin Abi Laila with it. Perhaps this is the correct view. It is a Hasan chain in which Al-Hajjaj explicitly stated hearing (Tahdith). Al-Tahawi extracted it.

Abdullah bin Ahmad said: My father told me: Amr bin Muhammad Al-Naqid told us, he said: Ubaidah bin Humaid Al-Dabbi told us from Ubaidullah - sic - bin Abdullah with it. So his saying: 'My father told me' is also a meaningless addition, for Al-Naqid narrates to Abdullah bin Ahmad directly as in the first narration, and I do not know that Ahmad narrates from him. And Allah knows best. In summary, the chain of this Hadith is Sahih; its men are men of Al-Bukhari except Abdullah bin Abdullah, who is Al-Razi, the freed slave of Banu Hashim, and he is trustworthy.

Even if we concede that impurity is in it, it is not valid to make it a cause, because if the cause were impurity, the situation would not differ between their A'tan and sheepfolds, since no one says there is a difference between the dung and urine of each of the two species, as Al-Iraqi said.

The companions of Al-Shafi'i and the companions of Malik reasoned the prohibition with this. Based on this, a distinction is made between the camels being present in their kneeling places (Ma'atin) and their absence from them, as their bolting is secured against in that case [absence]. Guiding to the correctness of this is the Hadith of Ibn Mughaffal in Ahmad with a Sahih chain with the wording: (Do not pray in the kneeling places of camels, for they were created from Jinn; do you not see their eyes and their appearance when they bolt?). I say: What contradicts this is that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, used to pray facing a camel, as will come in its place, if Allah the Exalted wills. This indicates that the prohibition is not due to the possibility of bolting, because this is also probable in this scenario which is permissible by agreement. Therefore, I see that the prohibition is specifically regarding the place - the Ma'tan (kneeling place) and the Mabrak (resting place) - whether camels are present therein or not at the time of prayer. The speech of Ibn Hazm indicates this; he said, may Allah have mercy on him: (Prayer is absolutely not permissible in a place taken for the kneeling of one camel or more, nor in a place taken as a Ma'tan for one camel or more. Prayer facing a camel is permissible. Based on this, if camels cease to seek shelter in that place until the name 'Ma'tan' no longer applies to it, prayer in it becomes permissible). Thus, the Hadith does not imply the differentiation that Al-Shawkani inclined towards. And Allah the Exalted knows best.

The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (I am traveling and in a state of busyness, so if we return, we will come to you and pray for you, if Allah wills).

So the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, called a group of Companions and said: (Go to this mosque whose people are unjust, destroy it and burn it). So they went out rushing, burned the mosque, and destroyed it). In the verse is evidence that prayer is not permissible in Masjid Al-Dirar and mosques with similar meaning. The Malikis and others held this view. Ibn Hazm stated in (Al-Muhalla) regarding His saying in the verse: {Do not stand in it ever}, he said: (So it is correct that it is not a place for prayer).",

Rather, the intent is the qualities it was described with: harm and division. Every mosque in which these qualities or some of them are found takes the ruling of Masjid Al-Dirar. Therefore, Al-Qurtubi said in his (Tafsir): (Our scholars said: Every mosque built for harm, or showing off (Riya') and reputation (Sum'ah), is in the ruling of Masjid Al-Dirar; prayer is not permissible in it). He also said: (Our scholars said: It is not permissible to build a mosque next to a mosque; it must be demolished and its building prevented so that the people of the first mosque do not leave it, leaving it empty, unless the neighborhood is large and one mosque does not suffice its people, then it is built. Likewise, they said: It is not appropriate to build two or three Jami's (congregational mosques) in one city; the second must be prevented, and whoever prays Jumu'ah in it, it does not suffice him. The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, burned Masjid Al-Dirar and demolished it. Al-Tabari narrated from Shaqiq that he came to pray in the mosque of Banu Ghadirah and found the prayer had finished. It was said to him: The mosque of Banu Fulan has not been prayed in yet. He said: I do not like to pray in it because it was built on harm).

They said: We have kneaded dough from it and drawn water. So he ordered them to throw away that dough and spill that water. Second: From Nafi' with the wording: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, camped with the people in the year of Tabuk. He camped with them at Al-Hijr near the houses of Thamud. The people drew water from the wells from which Thamud used to drink, kneaded dough from it, and set up pots with meat. So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered them, so they spilled [the pots] and fed the dough to the camels.

    "text": "(Imam Ahmad narrated in the narration of his son Abdullah with a clearer chain than this from Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, something similar to this: That he disliked prayer in the land of Babylon and the land of Khasf or similar to that. Imam Ahmad disliked prayer in these places following Ali, may Allah be pleased with him. His saying: 'He forbade me to pray in the land of Babylon for it is cursed' decrees that one does not pray in a cursed land. The famous Hadith regarding Al-Hijr agrees with this, for if entering the land of torment is forbidden, prayer and other things are included in that. Agreeing with that is His saying, The Exalted, regarding Masjid Al-Dirar: {Do not stand in it ever}, for it was among the places of torment. He, The Exalted, said: {Then is one who laid the foundation of his building on righteousness [with fear] from Allah and [seeking] His approval better or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a bank about to collapse, so it collapsed with him into the fire of Hell?} [At-Tawbah / 109].

The text of Ahmad: He does not pray in it). I say: We did not find evidence for the invalidity of prayer. The Hadith forbidding entry into the land of torment is not specific to prayer such that it is said it is invalid therein. Similarly, the Hadith of Ali, if authentic, does not indicate invalidity.

Al-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in (Al-Majmu'): (Our companions said: It is disliked that the place of the Imam or the Ma'mum be higher than the place of the other.

There is no evidence for this detail in the Sunnah; it is merely opinion. Rather, every place regarding which it can be validly said linguistically and customarily: 'It is higher than the place of the followers' is prohibited. Therefore, Al-Shawkani said after recounting the scholars' sayings regarding the referenced difference: (The conclusion from the evidences is the prevention of the Imam's elevation over the followers without differentiating between the mosque and others, nor between a stature, less than it, or more than it, due to Ibn Mas'ud's saying: 'They used to be forbidden from that' and Ibn Mas'ud's saying: 'The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, forbade...'

If it is less than that amount, the default is permissibility until evidence of prohibition stands. This principle is supported by the action of Abu Huraira mentioned, and it was not denounced against him). I say: The trace of Abu Huraira referred to was suspended by Al-Bukhari in his (Sahih) and connected by Ibn Abi Shaybah from the path of Salih, the freed slave of Al-Taw'amah, he said: I prayed with Abu Huraira on top of the mosque following the Imam's prayer.

(Except that exempted from this is if standing in this place is for the Imam's actions and movements in prayer to be visible to the followers so they can learn that from him; then it is permissible, rather recommended, because the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, prayed once on the Minbar (so he said Takbir and the people behind him said Takbir, and he ascended the Minbar [then bowed while on it] then raised [his head] then descended backwards until he prostrated at the base of the Minbar, then returned until he finished his prayer.

Is this anything but like someone using it as evidence for the permissibility of ascending the Minbar and descending from it during prayer absolutely without the intent of teaching?

The apparent meaning of the Hadith of Mu'awiyah bin Qurrah from his father and the Hadith of Anas mentioned by Al-Hakim is that it is forbidden (Haram). The cause for dislike is what Abu Bakr Ibn Al-Arabi said, that it is either due to the cutting of the row or because it is the place for collecting shoes.

Al-Tirmidhi said: A group of the people of knowledge disliked lining up between pillars, and this is the view of Ahmad and Ishaq. A group of the people of knowledge permitted that. End quote. Al-Nakha'i held the view of dislike. Sa'id bin Mansur narrated in his (Sunan) the prohibition of that from Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn Abbas, and Hudhayfah. Ibn Sayyid Al-Nas said: No opponent is known to them among the Companions. Abu Hanifa, Malik, Al-Shafi'i, and Ibn Al-Mundhir permitted it by analogy to the Imam and the individual. Ibn Al-Arabi said: There is no dispute regarding its permissibility in case of narrowness. As for in spaciousness, it is disliked for the congregation. As for the individual, there is no harm in it; the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, prayed in the Kaaba between its pillars. End quote. In it is that the Hadith of Anas mentioned in the chapter was reported in a state of narrowness due to his saying: 'So the people forced us.' It can be said: The necessity indicated in the Hadith did not reach the level of necessity where hardship is lifted. The Hadith of Qurrah only contains the mention of prohibition from lining up between pillars and did not say: We were forbidden from prayer between pillars. So in it is evidence for differentiating between the congregation and the individual. However, the Hadith of Anas which Al-Hakim mentioned contains prohibition of absolute prayer, so the absolute is carried on the restricted. What indicates this is his prayer, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, between the two pillars. So the prohibition based on this is specific to the prayer of followers [in congregation] between pillars, not the prayer of the Imam and the individual. This is the best of what is said. What preceded of analogizing the followers to the Imam and individual is invalid consideration (Fasid Al-I'tibar) due to its clashing with the Hadiths of the chapter). End of Al-Shawkani's words with some abbreviation, and it is all truth with no dust on it, except his saying: (That the Hadith of Anas in Al-Hakim...",

This, to me, is like an explanation for the prohibition mentioned before it. And Allah knows best. If this is authentic and the Hadith of Anas is authentic with this addition, then in it is the indication to the cause of prohibition, which is cutting the rows. Therefore, he ordered completing them in the Hadith itself. And Allah knows best. Imam Ahmad explicitly stated this; Abu Dawood said in his (Masa'il): (I heard Ahmad being asked about prayer between pillars? He said: It is only disliked because it cuts the row; if there is distance between them, I hope [it is fine]). Therefore, I say: It is appropriate for one who wants to build a mosque or Jami' to order the engineer to make a plan for him where pillars are few as possible to minimize the corruption resulting from their presence in mosques regarding cutting rows and narrowing the space for worshipers. It is indeed possible today to build a mosque without any pillar by means of cement and iron (concrete) if the mosque is not very wide. Several mosques have been built in Damascus on this model, like the (Lala Pasha) Mosque in Baghdad Street and Al-Murabit Mosque in Al-Muhajirin and others. The rows in them are all connected except the front rows; they are cut, unfortunately, due to this innovation that has pervaded almost all mosques.

Who would dare in those times to say to those donors: You are only building edifices to entrap the common people in the traps of innovation and spending your money to transform religion into formal worships, just as happened in the polytheism of all past nations who substituted the beauty of creed with the beauty of temple walls and the light of faith with the lights of altars, until they made the rites of religion resemble celebration banquets and closer to banquet gatherings due to the intensity of minds being distracted by inscriptions and decorations, and thoughts wandering in contemplation inside niches and creating Minbars? While the intent of those gatherings was to strip the mind of the distractions of the material world and save it from the charming clay appearance, and for the soul to go on the wings of that merged gathering to the door of Divine Mercy to knock on it with the hand of abstraction and pure servitude, to return to its world with light from the world of Holiness that stabilizes it in its struggle, establishes it on its path, and protects it from the trials of the world and its slippery slopes, until if it performs its function in this life, it ascends to its world with that strength it acquired and enters the gardens of Divine Emanation in the state prepared for it.

As for those behind the Minbar on the right side, they have no knowledge of the forgetfulness that occurred to the Imam, so they think he said Takbir correctly [for sitting], so they sit for Tashahhud while the Imam is standing. When he says Takbir for bowing (Ruku'), these people say Takbir for standing. They do not realize the opposition and lack of following they are in until the Imam raises his head from bowing saying (Sami' Allahu liman hamidah). Here begins the funny yet weeping scene; you see one of them cutting the prayer and renewing the start, another trying in his claim to catch the Imam and follow him so he stands from Tashahhud then stands for a moment then bows then raises then catches the Imam in prostration or after that. What is stranger than that may happen; sometimes it happens that some of them prompt the Imam if he intends to stand before Tashahhud to the third [Rak'ah] forgetfully by saying: (Subhan Allah). Those behind the Minbar hear it, so they know the Imam forgot, but they are ignorant of what happened to the Imam: Did he return to Tashahhud so they remain sitting, or had he stood up fully so it is not permissible for him then to return to Tashahhud so he remains standing and they stand with him? Therefore, you see them in confusion (Hais Bais); some sitting, some standing, another sat then stood, and a fourth conversely stood then sat thinking the Imam did likewise. All these farces resulted from opposing his guidance, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, regarding his Minbar. Perhaps those in charge of mosques will notice this and undertake what is incumbent upon them of reform therein: And {Indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or who listens while he is present [in mind]} [Qaf / 37].

Al-Ghazali said in (Al-Ihya): (One should not overlook three matters in seeking the first row (he mentioned the first and second then said:) The third: That the Minbar cuts some rows. The first row is only the single continuous one in the courtyard of the Minbar, and what is on its sides is cut. Al-Thawri used to say: The first row is the one appearing in front of the Minbar. This is plausible because it is connected and because the one sitting in it faces the Khatib (preacher) and hears from him. It is not far-fetched to say: The closest to the Qiblah is the first row, and this meaning is not observed). Al-Nawawi asserted this in (Al-Majmu') where he said: (Know that the intended is the first row which follows the Imam whether a Minbar, compartment, columns, or others intervene or not). In any case, prayer behind the Minbar is not free of dislike due to the exposure of prayer in it to corruption and invalidity. So either he prays in the row on the other side of the Minbar where the Imam's movements are not hidden from him, or he prays in the other row. We do likewise, if Allah wills; we do not pray between pillars but move back from them or advance as Anas bin Malik did. There is no difference for us between that and prayer behind the Minbar because the cause is one, and because in this prayer there is exposure to its corruption which is not in the prayer between pillars as preceded.

He said: Yes, he prayed (rak'a) two rak'ahs between these two pillars - and he pointed for him between the two pillars on your left when you enter. He said: Then he came out and prayed facing the Kaaba two rak'ahs. The context is Ahmad's. Layth and Awn bin Abi Sulaym and Khasif followed him on this addition: (two rak'ahs), both from Mujahid; Ahmad extracted them.

He said: He prayed two rak'ahs. Extracted by Abu Dawood, Al-Tahawi, Al-Bayhaqi, and Ahmad from Yazid bin Abi Ziyad from Mujahid from him. This Yazid is Al-Hashimi, and he is weak due to bad memory. However, Al-Hafiz cited the Hadith in (Al-Fath) with the wording: (He said: When he came out, peace and blessings be upon him, I asked those who were with him, so they said: He prayed two rak'ahs at the middle pillar. Al-Tabarani extracted it with a Sahih chain). So it appears that it is with Al-Tabarani from a path other than this Yazid, otherwise Al-Hafiz would not have authenticated it while he is the one who says in his biography in (Al-Taqrib): (Weak, grew old and changed and accepted prompting). Al-Tahawi also narrated it from his path similar to Al-Tabarani's narration.

Ibn Al-Turkmani refuted him saying: (I say: Urwa heard from his father Al-Zubayr, and his hadith from him is recorded in (Sahih Al-Bukhari) in places, and Al-Zubayr died earlier than Uthman bin Talha, so there is nothing preventing Urwa from hearing from Uthman. Furthermore, the author of (Al-Kamal) explicitly stated his hearing from him). Among them is from Jabir who said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) entered the House on the Day of Conquest and prayed two rak'ahs in it. Recorded by Al-Tahawi via Abu Al-Zubayr from him. Its men are trustworthy, but Abu Al-Zubayr is a Mudallis and he used the 'An'ana [saying 'from']. This has been problematized by Ibn Umar's statement in the previous narrations from him regarding Bilal that he said: Yes, he prayed two rak'ahs; along with his statement in the first narration via Nafi from him: And I forgot to ask him how much he prayed. Al-Bayhaqi and others answered this by saying that it (is possible that Ibn Umar reported the minimum of what prayer constitutes and remained silent about what exceeded that because he did not ask Bilal). Based on this, his saying: 'Two rak'ahs' is from the words of Ibn Umar, not from the words of Bilal, which is far-fetched as you see. Nevertheless, Al-Hafiz said after mentioning a similar reconciliation: (I found what supports this and provides another reconciliation between the two hadiths, which is what Umar bin Shabba recorded in Kitab Makkah via Abdul Aziz bin Abi Rawad from Nafi...",

Furthermore, Al-Hafiz went too far afield when he attributed the hadith of Ibn Abi Rawad to Ibn Shabba while it is in the (Musnad) with the exact mentioned wording.

This statement of Ibn Abbas was also narrated by Al-Tabarani with the wording: I do not like to pray in the Kaaba; whoever prays in it has left something behind him.

I say: It is authentically established from Ibn Abbas that he used to deny that the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed in the Kaaba, although he did not witness that. He would narrate that sometimes from his brother Al-Fadl as in this narration—and it is likewise in the (Musnad) and others from other paths—and sometimes he narrates it from Usama bin Zaid as in Muslim and others. Perhaps his hadith regarding facing the Qibla will come, God willing. However, scholars adopted the narration of Bilal and those with him from the Companions because it is an addition from a trustworthy person, and because he is an Affirmer (Muthbit), and the Affirmer takes precedence over the Negator (Nafi), as is the rule in such differences. The meaning of Usama's saying: 'He did not pray' is: 'I did not see him pray'. So he did not know, while the others knew, and he who knows is a proof against he who does not know. Therefore, the majority went to the permissibility of prayer in the House [Kaaba], both obligatory (Fard) and voluntary (Nafl).

Malik bin Anas said: There is no harm in voluntary prayer in the Kaaba, but he disliked that the obligatory prayer be prayed in the Kaaba. Al-Shafi'i said: There is no harm in praying the obligatory and voluntary prayer in the Kaaba because the ruling of voluntary and obligatory regarding purity and Qibla is the same). This which Al-Shafi'i said is the truth, God willing, because although the hadith appeared regarding voluntary prayer, it is apparent that the obligatory is like it in this permissibility due to the equality of rulings for voluntary and obligatory prayers in obligation, prohibition, and permissibility, except what the Lawgiver excluded, and there is no exception here. Due to the clarity of what Al-Shafi'i said, Ibn Hazm adopted it, and he is who he is in his literalism. He said in (Al-Muhalla) responding to the followers of Malik, the text of which is: (No one ever said: That his prayer, peace be upon him, mentioned was towards other than the Qibla. He, peace be upon him, has stated that the entire earth is a place of prayer (Masjid), and the interior of the Kaaba is the best of the earth and the most excellent, so it is the best of mosques and the most worthy for obligatory and voluntary prayer. It is not permissible for other than a rider, fearful person, or sick person to pray voluntary prayer towards other than the Qibla. Differentiating between the obligatory and voluntary without Quran, Sunnah, or Consensus is an error. And success is with Allah). Despite the clarity and obviousness of this, Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, differed in this, choosing what Malik, may Allah have mercy on him, went to.

As for the Prophet's prayer, peace be upon him, in the House, it was voluntary, so the obligatory is not appended to it, because he, peace be upon him, prayed inside the House two rak'ahs then said: This is the Qibla. It is likely - and Allah knows best - that his mention of this statement immediately after the prayer outside the House was an explanation that the Qibla commanded to be faced is the entire structure, lest someone imagine that facing part of it was [sufficient] in the obligatory prayer because he prayed the voluntary prayer in the House. Otherwise, all people knew that the Kaaba, in general, is the Qibla. So this statement must have a benefit and teach something that might be hidden and be a place of doubt. Ibn Abbas narrated this hadith and understood this meaning from it, and he is most knowledgeable of the meaning of what he heard). I say: Ibn Abbas who narrated the hadith did not understand this meaning with this detail that the Sheikh went to regarding the prayer of voluntary in the Kaaba exclusive of the obligatory. For he [Ibn Abbas] denied that he [the Prophet], peace be upon him, prayed in the House at all, as he said: 'And he did not pray until he exited from it; when he exited, he prayed two rak'ahs facing the Kaaba and said: This is the Qibla.' Furthermore, he, may Allah be pleased with him, did not hear this statement from him, peace be upon him, directly as the Sheikh's words imply; rather, he took it from Usama or others from the Companions as previously mentioned. In that case, he is equal to others who did not hear that from the Prophet, peace be upon him. Moreover, the Sheikh's words imply the permissibility of facing part of the structure of the Kaaba in voluntary prayer, but in obligatory prayer, one must face all of it. I wish I knew how it is possible to face all of it practically! For it is axiomatic that one facing the Kaaba from outside it only faces...",

In that case, what is the difference between this and praying inside it, for in both cases he is only facing part of it? Therefore, Ibn Hazm, may Allah have mercy on him, said: (The followers of Malik argued by saying: Whoever prays inside the Kaaba has turned his back on part of the Kaaba. [He said:] Allah Almighty only said: {And from wherever you go out [for prayer], turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you [believers] may be, turn your faces toward it} [Al-Baqarah: 150]. If what the Malikis mentioned were a proof, it would not be lawful for anyone to pray in the Masjid Al-Haram because it is the Qibla by the text of Allah's speech in the Quran, and whoever prays in it must inevitably turn his back on some of it; so the corruption of this saying is apparent. Also, anyone who prays towards the Masjid Al-Haram or towards the Kaaba must inevitably leave some of it to his right and some to his left. There is no difference according to any of the people of knowledge between turning one's back to the Qibla in prayer and placing it on his right or his left. So it is correct that Allah Almighty never tasked us with observing this; He only tasked us to face with our faces what faces us of the wall of the Kaaba or the wall of the Mosque facing the Kaaba wherever we are only). As for the Sheikh's saying, may Allah have mercy on him: (This statement must have a benefit), it is true, but it is not apparent from this statement what Sheikh Al-Islam understood regarding the difference between voluntary and obligatory in facing [the Qibla]. It seems that for this reason, none of the commentators went to it.

This indicates the permissibility of prayer in the entire House, and the Hijr is in it.

Ibn Al-Qayyim mentioned in (Al-Zad) similar to what we quoted from Al-Nawawi, and the text of his words in that is: (Precaution is only prescribed if the Sunnah is not clear. But if it is clear, then precaution is to follow it and leave what opposes it. If leaving it is for the sake of disagreement as a precaution, then leaving what opposes it and following it is more cautious and more cautious.

Al-Bukhari narrated it suspended (Mu'allaq), and Ibn Abi Shaybah and Saeed bin Mansour connected it, both from Ibn Al-Mubarak from Humaid who said: Anas used to pray on his mattress. In these hadiths is clear evidence for the permissibility of praying and prostrating on everything spread on the ground other than the earth.

It is the opinion of Al-Awza'i, Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, Ishaq, and the majority of jurists. In it is a refutation of those among the predecessors who denied it, like Al-Aswad and his companions. Malik agreed with them, for he said in (Al-Mudawwanah): (Malik used to dislike that a man prostrate on rugs, hair carpets, clothes, and leather. He used to say: There is no harm in standing on them, bowing on them, and sitting on them, but he should not prostrate on them nor place his palms on them). Ibn Hazm said: (This is a saying with no evidence for its correctness. Prostration is obligatory on seven limbs: the feet, the knees, the hands, the forehead, and the nose. He permits placing all these limbs on what we mentioned except the forehead; so what is the difference between the limbs of prostration?

From it is His saying: {I will show you the home (Dar) of the defiantly disobedient} [Al-A'raf: 145], because they used to call the locality where a tribe gathered: a Dar. From it is the hadith: No Dar remained but a mosque was built in it). Al-Shawkani quoted it. Sheikh Ali Al-Qari said in (Al-Mishkat): (Al-Dour) is plural of (Dar): It is a comprehensive noun for the building, the courtyard, and the locality. The intended meaning: The localities, for they used to call the locality where a tribe gathered a Dar. Or it is interpreted as adopting a room in the house for prayer like a mosque where the people of the house pray; Ibn Al-Malik said this. The first interpretation is the reliable one upon which practice is based. Then I saw Ibn Hajar mention that the meaning here is the localities and tribes. The wisdom of his command for the people of every locality to build a mosque therein is that it might be impossible or difficult for the people of a locality to go to another, thus being deprived of the reward of the mosque and the virtue of establishing the congregation in it. So they were ordered to do that so worship in their mosque would be facilitated for the people of every locality without hardship befalling them. Al-Baghawi said: Ata said: When Allah Almighty opened the garrison cities for Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, he ordered the Muslims to build mosques and ordered them not to build two mosques where one harms the other. Among the harm is the act of splitting the congregation if there is a mosque that accommodates them. If it becomes tight, he prescribed expanding it or adopting a mosque that accommodates them).

That is because of what it contains of dividing the gathering, scattering the unity of the worshipers, dissolving the bond of joining in worship, the loss of the splendor of the abundance of worshipers, the diversity of the word, the difference of orientations, and opposing the wisdom of the legislation of congregations - meaning the unification of voices in performing acts of worship and their returning to one another with benefits and assistance - and harming the old mosque or resembling harm, or the love of fame and reputation, and spending money where there is no necessity). And Sheikh al-Islam, may Allah have mercy on him, said in (Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas) (pp. 172-173) after mentioning the Mosque of Harm (Masjid al-Dirar): (For this reason, the Salaf disliked praying in what resembled that and considered the ancient [mosque] better than the new one, because the ancient is further from being built for harm than the new one regarding which the intent is feared. And the age of the mosque is something for which it is praised. For this reason He said: {Then their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House} and He said: {Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Bakkah}. For its antiquity implies the abundance of worship in it as well, and that implies an increase in its merit).",

He stayed with them for fourteen nights. Then he ordered the building of the mosque, so he sent for a group of Banu Najjar and said: 'O Banu Najjar, name a price to me for this enclosure of yours.' They said: 'No, by Allah, we do not seek its price except from Allah.' He said: It contained graves of the polytheists, ruins, and palm trees. So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, ordered the graves of the polytheists, so they were dug up; then the ruins, so they were leveled; and the palm trees, so they were cut down. They aligned the palm trunks towards the Qiblah of the mosque and made its jambs of stone. They began moving the rock while reciting poetry (Rajaz), and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was with them saying [while carrying the bricks: This burden (1) is not the burden of Khaybar, this is more righteous to our Lord and purer] 'O Allah, there is no good but the good of the Hereafter, so forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirah.' And in a narration: 'O Allah, indeed the reward is the reward of the Hereafter, so have mercy on the Ansar and the Muhajirah'). We cited the Hadith briefly, for in it after his saying 'fourteen nights': (Then he sent for Banu Najjar, and they came wearing swords. It is as if I am looking at the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, on his mount, and Abu Bakr is behind him, and the assembly of Banu Najjar is around him until he arrived at the courtyard of Abu Ayyub.

The first view is the more apparent, and Al-Hafiz approved of it in (Al-Fath). And Allah Almighty knows best. Furthermore, what must be noted is that this merit is only for one who builds a mosque seeking thereby the Face of Allah Almighty, as indicated by his saying in the Hadith: (for Allah). This is also indicated by the general texts from the Book and the Sunnah. As for one who intends by that boasting, showing off, and ingratiating himself to the masses as many emirs and notables do, there is nothing in it but sin.

Above this, it is a waste of money without any benefit to the mosque. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade gossip (Qil wa Qal), excessive questioning, and wasting money. That is because the purpose of building mosques is only to shelter people from heat and cold as preceded from Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, and decorating them is not part of that at all. Therefore, Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, forbade it by saying: And beware of painting red or yellow. Ibn Battal said: (It seems Umar understood that from the Lawgiver returning the Khamisah (patterned garment) to Abu Jahm due to the markings on it, saying: (It distracted me from my prayer). Al-Hafiz said: (It is possible that Umar had specific knowledge regarding this issue).

Al-Hafiz said: (And (Al-Saj): A known type of wood brought from India. Ibn Battal and others said: This indicates that the Sunnah in building the mosque is moderation and abandoning exaggeration in improving it. For Umar, despite the abundance of conquests in his days and the abundance of wealth with him, did not change the mosque from what it was. He only needed to renew it because the palm branches had decayed in his days. Then Uthman was - and wealth in his time was more abundant - so he improved it with what did not necessitate decoration. Yet despite that, some Companions objected to him as will come shortly. The first to decorate mosques was Al-Walid bin Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, and that was at the end of the era of the Companions. Many people of knowledge remained silent about denying that for fear of Fitnah... Ibn al-Munir said: When people raised their houses and decorated them, it was appropriate to do that with mosques to protect them from disdain. This was refuted by saying: If the prohibition was to encourage following the Salaf in abandoning luxury, then it is as he said. But if it was for fear of occupying the worshiper's mind with decoration, then no, because the cause remains. In the Hadith of Anas is a sign from the signs of Prophethood due to his informing, peace and blessings be upon him, of what would happen, and it happened as he said).

These are arguments that cannot be relied upon by one who has a share of success, especially when contradicted by Hadiths indicating that decoration is not from the command of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and that it is a type of prohibited boasting, and that it is from the signs of the Hour as narrated from Ali, peace be upon him, and that it is from the work of the Jews and Christians, and he, peace and blessings be upon him, used to love differing from them generally and specifically. The claim that the Salaf left denial is forbidden [incorrect], because decoration is an innovation introduced by the people of unjust states without permission from the people of knowledge and virtue. They introduced innovations that cannot be counted, and no one denies them. Scholars remained silent about them out of Taqiyyah (caution), not approval. Rather, a group of the scholars of the Hereafter stood in the face of their falsehood and shouted among them denouncing that against them. The claim that it is a good innovation is false, and we have informed you of the reason for its falsehood in the explanation of the Hadith: (Whoever does an action not in accordance with our matter, it is rejected) in the chapter of Prayer in Silk Garments and Usurped [Clothes]. The claim that it encourages to the mosque is corrupt, because being a caller to the mosque and encouraging to it only applies to one whose purpose and ultimate goal is looking at those engravings and decoration. As for one whose purpose is intending the mosques for the worship of Allah - which is not true worship except with Khushu', otherwise it is like a body without a soul - then they are nothing but a distraction from that, as he, peace and blessings be upon him, did with the Anbijaniyyah which he sent to Abu Jahm, and as preceded regarding his tearing down of curtains containing images, and as will come in (Chapter on Purifying the Qiblah of the worshiper from what distracts).

And among what indicates to you that the claim that the Salaf did not object to those who did decoration is a generally false claim: What Sa'id bin Mansur narrated: Sufyan told us from [Ibn] Abi Najih from Isma'il bin Abd al-Rahman bin Dhu'aib who said: I entered a mosque in Al-Juhfah with Ibn Umar. He looked at its battlements (Shurufat), then went out to a place and prayed in it. Then he said to the owner of the mosque: Indeed I saw in this mosque of yours - meaning the battlements - I likened them to the altars of the Jahiliyyah, so order that they be broken). I quoted it from (Iqtida' al-Sirat al-Mustaqim Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim) by Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah). This is an authentic chain; its narrators are trustworthy men of the Six except this Isma'il, who is trustworthy as in (Al-Taqrib). In (Al-Mudawwanah) by Ibn al-Qasim: (He said: I heard Malik mention the Mosque of Medina and what was done in its Qiblah of decoration and other things. He said: People disliked that when they did it, and that distracts people in their prayers; they look at it and it distracts them). Because of that, many scholars disliked praying in decorated and ornamented mosques.

It is taken from this that it is disliked in ornamented and engraved ones a fortiori, due to what it contains of occupying the worshiper's heart. It is prohibited to engrave it and make battlements for it from the yield of what is endowed for its construction or interests). Ibn Hazm exaggerated and said: (And prayer is not valid in a mosque created for boasting or harm to another mosque if its people can hear the call of the first mosque and there is no hardship on them in attending it. It is obligatory to demolish it and demolish every mosque created so people isolate themselves in it like monks or which the ignorant seek out seeking its merit while it does not have traces of a Prophet from the Prophets, peace be upon them. In his last statement is an indication of the permissibility of seeking out traces of Prophets to pray at them. This is an issue scholars differed on in the past. What is preferable to us is preventing the seeking of them, because there is no evidence from the Book and Sunnah for its permissibility, and because it may lead to excessiveness which is forbidden, and due to the prohibition of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him. Sa'id bin Mansur narrated in his (Sunan): Abu Mu'awiyah told us: Al-A'mash told us from Al-Ma'rur bin Suwayd from Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: We went out with him in a Hajj he performed. He recited to us in Fajr: {Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant} [Al-Fil: 1] and {For the accustomed security of the Quraysh} [Quraish: 1] in the second. When he returned from his Hajj, he saw people rushing to the mosque. He said: What is this? They said: A mosque the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, prayed in. He said: Thus perished the People of the Book before you; they took the traces of their prophets as churches/synagogues. Whoever is overtaken by prayer in it, let him pray, and whoever is not overtaken by prayer, let him pass on).",

Refer to the detailed discussion in this station in (Iqtida' al-Sirat al-Mustaqim). What we preferred of prevention applies to places where the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, prayed coincidentally. As for places he, peace and blessings be upon him, used to seek out for prayer and supplication at them, seeking them out for that sake is a Sunnah following his example, peace be upon him. Furthermore, that prevention applies if it is not accompanied by setting out on a journey (Shadd al-Rahl).

Al-Munawi said, critiquing Al-Suyuti's statement referred to: (I say: This is based on his understanding from the wording of the Hadith that his intent by 'Mihrab' is nothing but what is known in the mosque now. But it is not so, for the famous Imam known as Ibn Al-Athir has stated that the intended meaning of 'Mihrabs' in the Hadith is the front seats of assemblies. He said: And from it is the Hadith of Anas: He used to dislike Mihrabs. Meaning: He did not like to sit in the front of assemblies and elevate himself above people. End quote). I say: In this is that Ibn Al-Athir did not explicitly state what Al-Munawi mentioned. For the text of his words in Al-Nihayah is: ((Al-Mihrab): The high, overlooking place, and it is also the front of the assembly. From it the Mihrab of the mosque was named, which is its front and most noble place. And from it is the Hadith of Anas...) etc. of his words which Al-Munawi quoted.

Hence, a group of the Salaf disliked adopting them and praying in them. Al-Quda'i said: The first to introduce that was Umar bin Abdul Aziz while he was the governor for Al-Walid bin Abdul Malik over Medina when he established the Mosque of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, demolished it, and added to it. The standing place of the Imam in the mosque is called a Mihrab because it is the most noble of the sitting places of the mosque. From it, a palace is called Mihrab because it is the most noble of dwellings. And it was said: The Mihrab is the king's assembly, named so because of his seclusion in it. Likewise, the Mihrab of the mosque is due to the Imam's seclusion in it. And it was said: It was named so because the worshiper fights (yuharib) Satan in it). As for what is in (Awn Al-Ma'bud 'ala Sunan Abi Dawood): (What Al-Qari said that Mihrabs are innovations after him, peace be upon him, is questionable, because the existence of the Mihrab in his time, peace be upon him, is proven by some narrations. Al-Bayhaqi extracted in (Al-Sunan Al-Kubra) from Wa'il bin Hujr who said: I attended the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, he rose to the mosque and entered the Mihrab then raised his hands for Takbir). Sheikh Abdul Hayy Al-Kattani quoted it in (Al-Taratib Al-Idariyah) and affirmed it.

These Hadiths contain the prohibition of building mosques on graves, for building is one of the meanings of taking mosques on graves as previously explained there. It has appeared in some narrations explicitly with the wording: (Sahih) (They built a mosque over his grave and depicted those images in it. Those are the worst of creation in the sight of Allah on the Day of Resurrection). Extracted by both [Bukhari and Muslim]. Many scholars have held the view of prohibition. Imam Muhammad said in his book (Al-Athar): (We do not see that anything should be added to what came out of it (the grave), and we dislike that it be plastered or covered with clay, or that a mosque be made near it). And 'dislike' according to him implies prohibition when used absolutely. As for Al-Shafi'i, he said in (Al-Umm): (And I dislike that a mosque be built over the grave. He said: I dislike this due to the Sunnah and traditions (Athar), and he disliked - and Allah knows best - that any of the Muslims be glorified - meaning his grave be taken as a mosque - and fitnah (temptation) and misguidance for those who come after him is not secured against in that).

I say: But the 'dislike' according to them is for discouraging (Tanzih). Evidence for this is that they said: 'And it is disliked to pray upon a grave.' Al-Nawawi said: (Thus they said: (It is disliked). If it were said: It is prohibited (Haram) due to the Hadith of Abu Marthad and others as preceded, it would not be far-fetched). If Al-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, had said the like of this regarding the saying of his companions about the dislike of building, it would have been more worthy and appropriate, because the prohibition of building is more severe and stern than that of praying towards a grave, as is not hidden to anyone who has examined the Hadiths reported on this subject. Therefore, Sheikh Al-Islam said in (Al-Iqtida'): (As for building mosques over graves, the general groups [of scholars] have explicitly stated its prohibition in following the Hadiths. Our companions and others from the companions of Malik and Al-Shafi'i and others explicitly stated its forbidden nature (Tahrim). Some scholars used the term 'dislike' (Karaha) regarding it (as if referring to Al-Shafi'i), so I do not know if he meant Tanzih (discouragement) or Tahrim (prohibition)? And there is no doubt in asserting its prohibition). Then he cited the Hadiths reported in this chapter. Al-Qurtubi said in his (Tafsir) in summary: (So taking mosques on graves, praying in them, and building over them, and other things included in the Sunnah regarding prohibition, is forbidden).",

Sheikh Al-Islam also said in (Tafsir Surat Al-Ikhlas): (The scholars said: It is forbidden to build mosques over graves. And every mosque built over a grave must be demolished. Even if the deceased was buried in a mosque and his stay has been long, the grave should be leveled so that its form does not appear, for Shirk only occurs if its form appears. For this reason, the mosque of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was initially a graveyard for the polytheists containing palm trees and ruins. So he ordered the graves and they were exhumed, and the palm trees and they were cut, and the ruins and they were leveled. So it exited from being a graveyard and became a mosque. And since taking graves as mosques and building mosques over them was forbidden, nothing of that existed during the time of the Companions and the Tabi'in (Successors) who followed them in goodness, and a mosque over a grave was never known). This, and it might be imagined that the prohibition is only taking mosques over graves after burial, not if the mosque was built first and the grave was placed in its side for the endower of the mosque or someone else to be buried in. Al-Shawkani said: (Al-Iraqi said: The apparent meaning is that there is no difference, and that if the mosque is built with the intention that someone be buried in part of it, it enters under the curse. Rather, burial in the mosque is forbidden, and if they stipulated that he be buried in it, the condition is invalid for contradicting the implication of its endowment as a mosque.

I say: The answer is in Sharh Muslim by Al-Nawawi where he said: (The scholars said: The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, only forbade taking his grave and the grave of others as a mosque out of fear of exaggeration in glorification and being tempted by it, for that might lead to disbelief as happened to many past nations. When the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, and the Tabi'in needed to increase the [size of the] Mosque of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, when the Muslims increased in number, and the increase extended to include the houses of the Mothers of Believers, including the chamber of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, the burial place of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and his two companions Abu Bakr and Umar, may Allah be pleased with them, they built high, circular walls around the grave so it would not appear in the mosque for the common people to pray towards it and lead to the prohibited matter. Then they built two walls from the two northern corners of the grave and slanted them until they met so that no one could face the grave. For this reason, she said in the Hadith: (Had it not been for that, his grave would have been made prominent, but he feared that it might be taken as a mosque)). There is a reservation in his mentioning of the Companions in this story, even if Al-Ayni followed him in that in (Al-Umdah), because that did not happen in the presence of any Companion. Ibn Abdul Hadi said in (Al-Sarim Al-Munki): (And during the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs and the Companions, his chamber was outside the mosque, and there was nothing between them and it except the wall. Then the chamber was only incorporated into the mosque during the caliphate of Al-Walid bin Abdul Malik after the death of the generality of the Companions who were in Medina.

Then Ibn Abdul Hadi mentioned from Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah: (That when Al-Walid added to the mosque and the chamber was incorporated into it, the generality of the Companions had died, and none remained except those who realized the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, but had not reached the age of discernment where one is commanded with purity and prayer. It is known by concurrent reports (Tawatur) that this was during the caliphate of Al-Walid bin Abdul Malik. They mentioned that this was in the year ninety-one, and that Umar bin Abdul Aziz remained building it for three years. And in the year ninety-three, many people from the Tabi'in died, such as Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib and others from the Seven Jurists, and it is called: The Year of the Jurists). In summary, they only incorporated the grave of the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, into his mosque due to the need to expand it, and evidently, they did not find space from other directions to add to the mosque.

He also faulted it claiming it contradicts the authentic established Hadiths regarding the door of Abu Bakr, and claimed it was fabricated by the Rafidah to counter the authentic Hadith regarding the door of Abu Bakr. End quote. He erred in that a grievous error, for he followed the path of rejecting authentic Hadiths by imagining contradiction, whereas reconciling the two stories is possible). Then he mentioned the way of reconciling them, the summary of which is: (That the door of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, was towards the mosque and his house had no other door, so he was not ordered to close it. When they closed the doors by his command, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, they created wickets (Khawkha) to shortcut entry to the mosque from them, so they were ordered to close them afterwards). Al-Hafiz found this reconciliation good. I say: There is clear questionable aspect in it to me, because according to this, there is no merit for Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, in keeping his door as long as he had no other, so from where would he enter and exit? He is compelled, so his permission, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, to him would be for necessity, and there would be no difference then between him, may Allah be pleased with him, and anyone else if he were in a house like his. While the previous Hadiths indicate that it is a merit for Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, such that Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, wished he had this merit as preceded. So the closer view in reconciliation is what Ibn Kathir, may Allah have mercy on him, mentioned where he said after citing some paths of this Hadith:",

    "text": "(This does not contradict what is established in (Sahih Al-Bukhari) of his command, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, during his death illness to close the doors opening into the mosque except the door of Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq. Because the exception of this in Ali's right was during his [Prophet's] life due to Fatima's need to pass from her house to her father's house, so this was made as a gentleness to her. As for after his death, this reason ceased, so there was a need to open Al-Siddiq's door for his exit to the mosque to lead the people in prayer, since he was the Caliph over them after his death, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. In this is an indication to his Caliphate). This, and it appears that his command, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, to close the wickets and doors is of the type of blocking the means (Sadd al-Dhara'i), because their existence leads to using the mosque as a passageway, which is forbidden as will come in (Al-Manahi), paragraph (12). Therefore, Al-Hafiz said in the context of mentioning the benefits in the Hadith: (And that mosques are to be protected from being used as thoroughfares without necessity). Al-Qurtubi mentioned something similar regarding what we pointed to. (And it is permissible to build them on: (A) The places of worship of disbelievers after breaking them and changing their features. Talq bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: We went out as a delegation to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, swore allegiance to him, prayed with him, and informed him that in our land we have a synagogue (Bi'ah) belonging to us... He said: (Go out, and when you come to your land, break your synagogue... and take it as a mosque).

This is a Hasan chain; all its men are trustworthy except Mulazim - who is Ibn Umar - and Qais bin Talq, and they are truthful (Saduq) as in (Al-Taqrib). There is disagreement regarding Qais bin Talq that does not lower his Hadith from the rank of Hasan. Al-Dhahabi said in (Al-Mizan): (Ahmad and Yahya weakened him in one of the two narrations from him, and in the narration of Uthman bin Sa'id from him: Trustworthy. Al-Ajli declared him trustworthy.

He said: It was used to evidence the multiplication of prayer absolutely in the two mosques. It has been previously quoted from Al-Tahawi and others that this is specific to obligatory prayers due to his saying, peace be upon him: (The best prayer of a man is in his house except the obligatory). It can be said: There is nothing preventing keeping the Hadith on its generality, so the voluntary prayer in a house in Medina or Mecca is multiplied over prayer in a house elsewhere, and likewise in the two mosques, even if prayer in the houses is better absolutely).

We have mentioned that Adam set up a dome over it and that the angels said to him: We circumambulated this House before you, and that the Ark circumambulated it for forty days or so. But all these reports are from the Children of Israel, and we have established that they are neither believed nor disbelieved, so they are not used as proof. But if the Truth rejects them, they are rejected. Allah has said: {Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Bakkah...} [Al Imran: 96] the verse). It was narrated in a Hadith that the first one to build it was Adam, peace be upon him, but it is weak as will come. A problem was raised from the Hadith stating: (That between the two mosques, Al-Masjid Al-Haram and Al-Aqsa, was forty years), because the builder of Al-Aqsa was Solomon, peace be upon him, as indicated by the Hadith of Abdullah bin Amr coming soon, God willing. And between him and Abraham, peace be upon him, is more than a thousand years according to what historians say. Furthermore, the text of the Quran - as Al-Hafiz said - states that the story of David killing Goliath was after Moses by a period. This has been answered with several answers; perhaps the closest is the statement of Al-Khattabi: (It is likely that Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa was first founded by some of the Awliya [allies] of Allah before David and Solomon, then David and Solomon added to it and expanded it, so its building was attributed to them).

(This Hadith clarifies the intended meaning of His saying: {Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Bakkah - blessed and a guidance for the worlds}, meaning: The first house placed for worship). Al-Hafiz said in the explanation of the previous Hadith: (This Hadith interprets the meaning of His saying: {Indeed, the first House...} the verse, and indicates that the intended meaning by 'the House' is the House of Worship, not houses absolutely.

His brother Abdullah bin Umar also followed him in Al-Tayalisi (p. 251 no. 1826) and Ahmad (2/68). The second: Ibn Juraij's narration from him.

Its length was equal to its width, one hundred cubits by one hundred, and it was said: seventy by sixty. Then Uthman added to it, making its length one hundred and sixty cubits and its width one hundred and fifty. Then Al-Walid bin Abd al-Malik added to it, making its length two hundred cubits and its width at the front two hundred and at the back one hundred and eighty.

If you know that, and know the merit of prayer in his mosque, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned in the previous Hadiths, does that include those many additions which are approximately double the Prophetic Mosque? Al-Nawawi answered in the negative, as he said in (Sharh Muslim): (Know that this virtue is specific to his mosque itself, peace and blessings be upon him, which existed in his time, excluding what was added to it afterwards. So the worshiper should be keen on that and be aware of what I mentioned).

He said: (The traditions have come that the ruling of the addition to his mosque is the ruling of the added-to [original]; prayer is multiplied therein by a thousand prayers, just as the Sacred Mosque's addition has the ruling of the added-to [original], so Tawaf is permissible in it, and Tawaf is only in the mosque, not outside it. For this reason, the Companions agreed that they pray in the first row of the addition added by Umar then Uthman, and all Muslims acted upon that. Were it not that its ruling is the ruling of his mosque, that would be a prayer in other than his mosque, and the Companions and all Muslims after them would not maintain turning away from his mosque to other than his mosque and order that. Abu Zaid (Umar bin Shabbah al-Numayri in the book (Akhbar al-Madinah) said: Muhammad bin Yahya told me: One whom I trust told me that Umar added to the mosque from the Qiblah side up to the place of the enclosure (Maqsurah) which is there today. He said: As for what the people of our city do not doubt, it is that Uthman is the one who placed the Qiblah in its place today, then it was not changed after that. Abu Zaid said: Muhammad bin Yahya told us from Muhammad from Uthman (thus, and perhaps: Muhammad bin Uthman) from Mus'ab bin Thabit from Khabbab that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said - while in his prayer place one day -: If we were to add to our mosque. And he pointed with his hand towards the Qiblah. Muhammad bin Yahya told us from Muhammad bin Ismail from Ibn Abi Dhi'b who said: Umar said: If the mosque of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, were extended to Dhu al-Hulayfah, it would be part of it.

Abu Hurairah used to say: By Allah, if this mosque were extended to my house, I would not exceed praying in it. Muhammad told us: Abd al-Aziz bin Imran told us from Fulayh bin Sulaiman from Ibn Amrah who said: Umar added to the mosque on its Shami [northern] side, then said: If we were to increase in it until it reaches the graveyard, it would be the mosque of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. Sheikh al-Islam said: (This is what the traditions brought, which is indicated by the speech of the early Imams and their action. For they said: Obligatory prayer behind the Imam is better, and this which they said is what the Sunnah brought. Likewise was the matter during the time of Umar and Uthman, for both of them added to the Qiblah side of the mosque, so his [the Imam's] standing place in the five prayers was in the addition, as well as the place of the first row which is the best place to stand in by Sunnah and consensus. Since it is so, it is impossible that prayer in other than his mosque be better than in his mosque, and that the Caliphs and the first rows were praying in other than his mosque. I have not heard from any of the Muslims differing with this, but I saw some later scholars (it seems he means Al-Nawawi) mentioned that the addition is not from his mosque, and I do not know of anyone from the scholars of the Salaf who mentioned that. He said: We alerted to these matters here because knowledge of them is needed, and most people do not know how the matter was, nor the ruling of Allah and His Messenger in much of that). This is the end of Sheikh al-Islam's words, may Allah have mercy on him, as quoted by Al-Hafiz Ibn Abd al-Hadi in his book (Al-Sarim al-Munki) (pp. 139-140).

Therefore, none of the Companions used it as evidence when they disputed about his burial place. If this were with them, it would have been a text in the place of dispute.

Is the intended meaning by 'the house' all the houses that belonged to his wives, peace be upon them, or is the intended meaning one house among them, which is Aisha's house where his grave came to be? The apparent is the second. This is indicated by the fact that the Salaf who narrated the Hadith with the wording: (my grave) instead of (my house) understood it as referring to the house in which is his grave, as previously mentioned. Al-Hafiz inclined to this in (Al-Fath) where he said after ruling the mistake of Ibn Asakir's narration mentioned previously: (Yes, it occurred in the Hadith of Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas in Al-Bazzar with a chain whose men are trustworthy, and in Al-Tabarani from the Hadith of Ibn Umar with the wording: The Grave. Based on this, the intended meaning by 'the house' in his saying: 'my house' is one of his houses, not all of them, which is Aisha's house where his grave came to be.

Within it are men who love to purify themselves; and Allah loves those who purify themselves} [At-Tawbah / 108], implies that the intended mosque is the Mosque of Quba, because there are two pronouns in the verse referring to a single antecedent without dispute. The pronoun of the adverb which requires the purified men is the Mosque of Quba, so it is the one founded on piety. The evidence for this is the reason for the revelation of the verse. It is what Ahmad extracted (3/422) via Abu Owais: Shurahbil told us from Uwaym bin Sa'idah al-Ansari that he told him: That the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, came to them in the Mosque of Quba and said: (Indeed Allah Blessed and Exalted has praised you well regarding purification in the story of your mosque, so what is this purification that you purify yourselves with?)

If you know what preceded, that the apparent meaning of the verse and the reason for revelation imply it is the Mosque of Quba, and that the Hadith contrary to that implies it is the Prophetic Mosque, then reconciliation between them is necessary. Ibn Kathir said: (There is no contradiction between the verse and this, because if the Mosque of Quba was founded on piety from the first day, then the Mosque of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, is so by greater reason and priority).

That is because Allah revealed to him: {A mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in}. And his mosque was more worthy of this description. It is established in (Al-Sahih) that he was asked about the Mosque founded on piety, so he said: (It is this mosque of mine), meaning that it is more perfect in this description than the Mosque of Quba. And the Mosque of Quba was also founded on piety and because of it (thus) [was] the verse. Therefore He said: {Within it are men who love to purify themselves; and Allah loves those who purify themselves}. The people of Quba used to clean themselves with water along with Wudu and Ghusl, and they learned that from their Jewish neighbors, and the Arabs did not do that. So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, wanted no one to think that the one founded on piety was other than his mosque, so he mentioned his mosque is more worthy to be the one founded on piety. So His saying: {A mosque founded on righteousness} [At-Tawbah / 108] encompasses his mosque and the Mosque of Quba and encompasses every mosque founded on piety, unlike the mosques of harm (Dirar)). Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar adopted this reconciliation and reported similar from Al-Dawudi, Al-Suhaili, and others. It is the truth that must be resorted to, because the contrary necessitates either rejecting what the Quran implies for the sake of the Hadith or vice versa, and both matters are error, nay misguidance. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (Indeed I have been given the Quran and its like with it). What indicates that it is the Mosque of Quba in addition to what preceded will come: (c): Then Al-Aqsa Mosque. Allah Almighty said: {Exalted is He who took His Servant by night...} the verse.

For Thawr - who is Ibn Yazid Al-Himsi - is trustworthy and firm as in (Al-Taqrib) and in (Al-Khulasah): (One of the firm ones).",

And how so when Mu'awiyah bin Salih also differed with him and narrated it connected like the narration of Thawr bin Yazid as Al-Hafiz mentioned in (Al-Isabah). Therefore, Al-Turkumani said in (Al-Jawhar al-Naqi): (I say: The Hadith is not strong, as Abd al-Haqq said in his (Ahkam). Perhaps what led him to that is the difference in its chain, for Abu Dawood extracted it as Al-Bayhaqi mentioned, and Ibn Majah extracted it from the hadith of Thawr bin Yazid from Ziyad bin Abi Sawdah from his brother Uthman bin Abi Sawdah from Maimunah). For this reason, the author of (Al-Kamal) said: (Ziyad narrated from Maimunah and from his brother from her, and it is the correct view). Therefore, he said in (Al-Zawa'id): (Abu Dawood narrated part of it, and the chain of Ibn Majah's path is authentic and its men are trustworthy. It is more correct than Abu Dawood's path because between Ziyad bin Abi Sawdah and Maimunah is Uthman bin Abi Sawdah, as explicitly stated by Ibn Majah in his path, as Salah al-Din mentioned in (Al-Marasil), and he was omitted in Abu Dawood). After writing what preceded, I returned to (Al-Majmu') by Al-Nawawi, and found he also went to strengthening the Hadith, where he said (8/278) in summary: (Ahmad narrated it in his (Musnad) with this wording, and Ibn Majah also narrated it with it with an acceptable (La ba'sa bihi) chain, and Abu Dawood narrated it briefly with a good (Hasan) chain).",

Then he mentioned the Hadith of setting out on a journey, and it is coming. This Hadith and the one after it (And he said: (Indeed Solomon son of David, when he built Bayt al-Maqdis, asked Allah Almighty for three characteristics: He asked Allah Almighty for judgment that coincides with His judgment, and he was given it. And he asked Allah Almighty for a kingdom that no one after him would have, and he was given it. And he asked Allah Almighty when he finished building the Mosque that no one comes to it, urged by nothing but prayer in it, except that He takes him out of his sin like the day his mother bore him. [So we hope that Allah Almighty has given him that]). The Hadith was extracted by Al-Nasa'i (1/112-113) via Abu Idris Al-Khawlani, and the context is his; Ibn Majah (1/430) via Abu Zur'ah Al-Shaybani Yahya bin Abi Amr; Ahmad (2/176) via Rabi'ah bin Yazid; and Al-Hakim (1/30) via him and Al-Shaybani together - and the addition is theirs - all three from Abdullah bin Fairuz Al-Daylami from Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-Aas elevated with it.

So David built a house for himself before building the House he was ordered to. So Allah revealed to him: O David, did you erect your house before My House?

He complained of that to Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty revealed to him: (It is not fitting for you to build a House for Me). He said: O Lord, why? He said: Because of the blood that flowed on your hands. He said: O Lord, was that not for Your sake and love? He said: Yes, but they are My servants and I have mercy on them.

In this Hadith of Abu Dharr, a prayer in his mosque, peace and blessings be upon him, is better than four prayers in Al-Aqsa Mosque. This does not agree in meaning with the two referred Hadiths, for it implies that the merit of prayer in it is four times the prayer in Al-Aqsa, resulting in prayer in Al-Aqsa Mosque being a quarter of prayer in the Prophetic Mosque, i.e., worth two hundred and fifty prayers. This result does not agree with what is established in the many previous Hadiths that prayer in Al-Aqsa is worth a thousand or five hundred. It is said: Allah Glorified and Exalted made the virtue of prayer in Al-Aqsa two hundred and fifty prayers first, then brought it to five hundred, then to a thousand, as a bounty from Him Exalted upon His servants and a mercy. And Allah Almighty knows best the reality of the matter. (And from the virtue of these three mosques is that it is not permissible to intend travel to a mosque or place among the virtuous places and prayer in them except to them, due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (Do not set out (and in a narration: Do not set out [plural]) on a journey except (and in a wording: Travel is only undertaken) to three mosques: this mosque of mine, the Sacred Mosque, and Al-Aqsa Mosque).

Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in the third treatise of (Majmu' Al-Rasa'il Al-Kubra) (3/53): (It is a widespread (Mustafid) Hadith; the people of knowledge have agreed on its authenticity and receiving it with acceptance and belief). His saying: (Do not saddle the mounts - La Tushaddu Al-Rihal): Al-Hafiz said: (With a Damma on the first letter in the wording of negation. The intended meaning is the prohibition of traveling to other than them. Al-Tibi said: It is more eloquent than explicit prohibition, as if he said: It is not correct that one intends to visit except these places due to the exclusivity they are distinguished with. Al-Rihal is the plural of Rahl: which is for the camel like the saddle is for the horse. He used 'saddling the mounts' as a metonymy for travel because it is its requisite. Mentioning them came out as the dominant case in riding for travel, otherwise there is no difference between riding mounts, horses, mules, donkeys, and walking regarding the mentioned meaning. His saying in the second wording indicates this: (One only travels)). His saying: (Except to three mosques): Al-Hafiz said: (The exception is emptied (Mufarragh), and the estimation is: Mounts are not saddled to any place; its implication is the prevention of travel to every place other than them because the excluded-from in the emptied exception is estimated by the most general of the general, but",

There is a difference of opinion regarding saddling mounts to [places] other than them, such as going to visit the righteous, alive and dead, and to virtuous places intending blessing by them and prayer in them. Sheikh Abu Muhammad Al-Juwayni said: (It is forbidden to saddle mounts to other than them, acting upon the apparent meaning of the Hadith). Judge Husayn indicated his choice of this, and Iyad and a group said it. What indicates this is what the authors of the Sunan narrated of Abu Basrah Al-Ghifari's denunciation of Abu Huraira's exit to Al-Tur, and he said to him: (If I had caught you before you went out, you would not have gone out). He used this Hadith as evidence, which indicates that he sees carrying the Hadith on its generality, and Abu Huraira agreed with him. The correct view according to Imam Al-Haramain and others among the Shafi'is: That it is not forbidden. They answered the Hadith with answers, among them: That the meaning is: Complete virtue is only in saddling mounts to these mosques, contrary to others, for it is permissible. It occurred in a narration by Ahmad which will be mentioned with the wording: (It is not fitting for the mounts to work), which is a wording apparent in other than prohibition [i.e., dislike].",

Ibn Battal said this. Among them: That the intended is the ruling of mosques only, and that mounts are not saddled to a mosque among the mosques to pray in it other than these three. As for intending other than mosques to visit a righteous person, a relative, a companion, seeking knowledge, trade, or recreation, it does not enter into the prohibition. This is supported by what Ahmad narrated from the path of Shahr bin Hawshab, he said: I heard Abu Sa'id, and prayer at Al-Tur was mentioned in his presence, so he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (It is not fitting for the worshiper (1) to saddle his mount to a mosque where prayer is sought other than Al-Masjid Al-Haram, Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa, and my Mosque). And Shahr is good (Hasan) in Hadith, even if there is some weakness in him). I say: Al-Hafiz, may Allah have mercy on him, softened his speech here regarding Shahr and deemed his Hadith Hasan with this wording, even though he judged him to be frequent in delusions as previously quoted from him. So how can the Hadith of someone like that be Hasan? Especially if he was alone in it excluding everyone who narrated the Hadith. For it was reported from three other paths from Abu Sa'id, and they do not contain this addition which Al-Hafiz used as proof, which is: (to a mosque). Added to that, the Hadith was reported from seven Companions other than Abu Sa'id from many paths via trustworthy narrators, and none of them said what Shahr said. Is there, after this, proof and evidence for Shahr's error in this addition?",

Because of that, we held the view there that it is not permissible to use this narration as proof. Another argument appeared to me supporting Shahr's error, so I say: What indicates to you the weakness of this addition, rather its invalidity: That in the Hadith of Shahr himself, Abu Sa'id denied him going to Al-Tur and argued against him with this Hadith. If it contained this addition which restricts its meaning to mosques excluding other virtuous places, it would not have been permissible for Abu Sa'id - and he is the pure Arab - to argue with it, because Shahr only intended to go to Al-Tur, and it is not a mosque, but rather a holy mountain upon which Allah The Exalted spoke to Musa, peace be upon him. So the Hadith would not include it if the addition were in it. So his denial of going to it is the biggest proof of the invalidity of attributing it to his Hadith, and also proof that the Hadith is upon its generality and that it includes virtuous places, because that is what Abu Sa'id understood. Likewise, Abdullah bin Umar and Abu Basrah Al-Ghifari understood from it, and Abu Huraira agreed with him. All of them denied going to Al-Tur, arguing with the Hadith as preceded in the extraction of their Hadiths. So these are four of the Companions - with no opponent from among them - who understood that, and they are more knowledgeable of what they heard from him, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and more aware of what he says. Then, reasoning dictates the correctness of the Hadith's generality, because if travel was prevented to a mosque other than the three mosques, with the knowledge that worship in all mosques is better than in non-mosques and houses, and he, peace be upon him, said: (The most beloved of spots",

Especially if the intended place is graves of Prophets and righteous people, for building mosques on them was forbidden as passed, so how can going to them be permitted when travel to mosques built on piety was not permitted? This - praise be to Allah - is clear and not hidden. As for the other two answers which Al-Hafiz narrated, they are also weak. Here is the explanation: As for the first answer, the Hadith, even if it is with the wording of negation, implies prohibition (Nahy) as Al-Hafiz himself narrated from Al-Tibi. Two things support this: First: That it came explicitly as prohibition in the second narration: (Do not saddle). The other: That it is what the Companions understood, so they forbade going to Al-Tur as preceded. There is a third matter that strengthens this: That the Hadith from the narration of Abu Sa'id in the (Two Sahihs) and others is a piece of a Hadith in which prohibition was mentioned regarding four matters: (A) Saddling mounts (B) Travel of a woman without a Mahram (C) Fasting the days of Fitr and Adha (D) Prayer after Subh and Asr. The prohibition in this is for forbiddenness (Tahrim), so interpreting the prohibition of saddling mounts specifically as discouragement (Tanzih)",

The narration of Ahmad which Al-Hafiz used as proof with the wording: (It is not fitting for the mounts to work) is not authentic as previously explained repeatedly, so there is no proof in it. Furthermore, even if this narration were authentic, it does not indicate permissibility stripped of dislike; rather, it is a text for dislike. Thus, Al-Nawawi's statement in the explanation of the Hadith from Abu Sa'id's narration: (The correct view according to our companions is that it is neither forbidden nor disliked) is incorrect. Al-Nawawi also said in the explanation of the Hadith from Abu Huraira's narration, the text of which is: (Its meaning according to the majority of scholars: There is no virtue in saddling mounts to a mosque other than them). This is an admission from him that travel to other than the three mosques has no virtue in it, so it is not a righteous deed, nor an act of closeness, nor obedience. It is known and witnessed that whoever intends travel to others seeks by that closeness to Allah The Exalted, and this is forbidden by agreement because he worships Allah The Exalted with what He did not make worship. Therefore, scholars mentioned that (if one vows to pray in a mosque or shrine, or perform I'tikaf in it, or travel to it, other than these three, this is not obligatory upon him by the agreement of the Imams. Contrary to if he vows to come to Al-Masjid Al-Haram for Hajj or Umrah, that is obligatory by the agreement of scholars. If he vows to come to the Mosque of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, or Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa for prayer or I'tikaf, fulfilling this vow is obligatory upon him according to Malik, Al-Shafi'i, and Ahmad",

As for the majority, they obligate the fulfillment of every act of obedience due to what Al-Bukhari and others narrated from Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, raised [to the Prophet]: (Whoever vows to obey Allah, let him obey Him, and whoever vows to disobey Allah, let him not disobey Him). Traveling to the two mosques is obedience, so fulfilling it is obligatory. As for traveling to a spot other than the three mosques, no scholar has obligated traveling to it if one vows it. Scholars even stated that one does not travel to the Quba Mosque because it is not one of the three, even though visiting it is recommended for one who is in Medina because that is not saddling a mount [travel], as will come. They said: Because traveling to visit the graves of Prophets and righteous people is an innovation not done by any of the Companions and Tabi'in, nor did the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, command it, nor did any of the Imams of the Muslims recommend it. So whoever believes that is worship and does it, he is opposing the Sunnah and the consensus of the Imams. This is among what Abu Abdullah bin Batta mentioned in his (Al-Ibanah Al-Sughra) regarding innovations contrary to the Sunnah and Consensus) (1). It remains for us to answer the second answer cited by Al-Hafiz. We say: It is a specification of the Hadith without any specifier, and the Hadith is more general than that. Anyone can claim specification of any general text from the Book or Sunnah, but that is not accepted from him unless accompanied by proof and evidence. So where is the proof here for this claim?",

This is not appropriate unless evidence stands against what they interpreted). Abu Al-Tayyib Siddiq Hasan Khan added in (Fath Al-Allam) (1/310): (And there is no evidence. The Hadiths reported regarding the encouragement of the Prophetic Visit and its virtue do not contain the command to saddle mounts to it, alongside the fact that they are all weak or fabricated, none of which are suitable for evidence. Most people did not notice the difference between the issue of visiting and the issue of traveling for it, so they diverted the Hadith of the chapter from its clear logic without evidence calling for it). I say: Visiting the grave of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, does not need evidence from the weak Hadiths referred to. In the chapter, there is what suffices instead of them. Even if there were nothing in the chapter except the general Hadiths on visiting graves, it would suffice to establish the visiting of his grave, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and that is a fortiori as is not hidden. Perhaps clarification and explanation of that will come in the appropriate place. The Summary: What Abu Muhammad Al-Juwayni and those who agreed with him went to regarding the prohibition of traveling to virtuous places other than the three mosques is the truth which must be resorted to. Contrary to travel for trade, seeking knowledge, and the like, for travel is to seek that need wherever it is. Likewise, travel to visit a brother in Allah, for he is the intended one wherever he is.",

Great trials occurred to him, may Allah have mercy on him, because of his fatwa prohibiting saddling mounts to visit the graves of Prophets and righteous people, even the grave of our Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. His books are overflowing with evidence for what he held. Imam Al-Subki - who was his contemporary - refuted him and authored for that his book named: (Shifa' Al-Siqam fi Ziyarat Khair Al-Anam), in which he cited the Hadiths reported regarding visiting his grave, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and the sayings of scholars regarding its legislation. He committed a grave error in it where he attributed to Sheikh Al-Islam the view of denying the Prophetic Visit absolutely - meaning without saddling a mount - even though he is among those who advocate it and mention its virtue and manners. He mentioned that in more than one of his books. Therefore, the Hafiz Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Abdul Hadi undertook the refutation of Al-Subki in a large work of his which he named: (Al-Sarim Al-Munki fi Al-Radd 'ala Al-Subki). It is a valuable book containing many jurisprudential, Hadith, and historical benefits. He clarified in it extensively and in detail the status of the referenced Hadiths and what they contain of weakness and fabrication, and absolved Ibn Taymiyyah from what was attributed to him of denial by what he quoted from him of many texts.

So whoever wishes to stand on the truth, let him return to it and place all his reliance on it.

A man from his companions comes and says: May my father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah, give me your palms [let me carry it]. He says: No, take another like it. Until he founded it and said: Indeed Gabriel, peace be upon him, is leading [setting the direction towards] the Kaaba. He said: So it used to be said: It is the most accurately oriented mosque in Qibla). Al-Haythami said (4/11): (And its men are trustworthy). I do not believe it is authentic, for it is from the path of Asim bin Suwayd from Ubaid bin Wadi'ah from her. Ibn Abi Asim and Al-Zubayr bin Bakkar narrated it from two paths from Asim, briefly and at length. Likewise, Al-Hasan bin Sufyan and Ibn Mandah extracted it from the path of Salamah bin Asim Ibn Suwayd.

    "foot_note": "1. (1) I remember reading from some scholars that they held the view that the meaning of his saying in the Hadith: (Every Saturday) means every week, and that the intent is not Saturday itself. He argued for that linguistically with what I do not recall now, nor do I remember now in which book I read that. Whoever finds it, let him write [it down]. If that is correct, there is no indication in the Hadith for specification at all. Then I came across who mentioned that, which is Imam Abu Shama Al-Shafi'i in his book (Al-Ba'ith 'ala Inkar Al-Bida' wal-Hawadith). He mentioned in it what agrees with what we went to regarding the impermissibility of specification. Here is his entire statement on that. He said, may Allah have mercy on him (p. 34): (It is not appropriate to specify acts of worship to times not specified by the Sharia. Rather, all types of righteousness should be general in all times, with none having preference over another except what the Sharia preferred and specified with a type of worship. If that is the case, that specific worship is distinguished by that virtue over others, like fasting the day of Arafah and Ashura, praying in the depths of the night, and Umrah in Ramadan. And among times is what the Sharia made preferred for all acts of righteousness, like the ten of Dhul-Hijjah and the Night of Decree which is better than a thousand months, meaning deeds in it are better than deeds in a thousand months that do not contain the Night of Decree. Similarly, any act of righteousness performed in it has preference over its counterpart in another time. In summary, the legally responsible person (Mukallaf) does not have the position of specification; rather, that belongs to the Lawgiver. This was the characteristic of the worship of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Then he cited the Hadith of the (Two Sahihs) from Aisha that she said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to fast until we would say: He does not break fast, and break fast until we would say: He does not fast. And the Hadith of Alqamah who said: I said to Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her: Did the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, specify anything of the days? She said: No, his deed was continuous. Then he said: (Muhammad bin Salamah said: No mosque is come to believing there is virtue in it after the three mosques except the Mosque of Quba. He said: And it is disliked to set a specific day for it to be come to, for fear of innovation and that time might prolong",

    "text": "Similarly, using the Hadith as evidence for the permissibility of the mentioned specification is also not good, unless the intent by specification is observing public interest (Maslahah), not preferring one day over another without a text from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. An example of that is specifying a day for teaching or delivering a lecture so people gather to hear that. There is no objection to this because the day is not intended for itself, therefore it is moved from it to another repeatedly in pursuit of interest. This is unlike specifying some days for some acts of worship claiming they are better in them than in others, like specifying the night of the two Eids for standing [in prayer] and worship, and specifying their day for visiting - meaning visiting graves - and specifying the month of Rabi' al-Awwal for reading the story of the birth of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. All this and its likes are innovations and evils that must be rejected and forbidden. Therefore, when Al-Nawawi used the Hadith in (Sharh Muslim) as evidence for the permissibility of specification, he said: (Ibn Maslamah Al-Maliki disliked that, and perhaps these Hadiths did not reach him). I say: This is far-fetched. More likely, they reached him but he did not understand from them what Al-Nawawi and others went to. We have clarified what is the truth to us regarding the issue.

But the meaning of this is that he used to visit it every week, and Saturday was used to express the week just as Friday is used to express it. Its parallel is what is in the (Two Sahihs) from the Hadith of Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, regarding the Prophet's seeking rain (Istisqa) on Friday; he said in it: So by Allah, we did not see the sun for a Saturday [week].

They have no proof in it because Quba is not a shrine but a mosque, and traveling to it [shrines] is forbidden by agreement of the Imams because that is not a prescribed travel. Rather, if one traveled to Quba from his family's house, it would not be permissible. But if he traveled to the Prophetic Mosque then went from there to Quba, this is recommended, just as visiting the graves of the people of Baqi' and the martyrs of Uhud is recommended).

Ibn Hibban narrated it and cited his chain to him and said: (This is false, fabricated). Ibn Al-Jawzi extracted it in (Al-Mawdu'at). Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, was asked about (Two men differed regarding prayer in the Umayyad Mosque: Is it worth ninety prayers as they claimed or not?

And they mentioned that the sleeper in Sham is like the one standing in prayer at night in Iraq, and they mentioned that the voluntary faster in Iraq is like the one breaking fast in Sham, and they mentioned that Allah created blessing in seventy-one parts, one part in Iraq and seventy in Sham, is that correct or not?). He answered: (Praise be to Allah, no Hadith has been reported regarding the Mosque of Damascus from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, about multiplying prayer in it, but it is one of the mosques where Allah Almighty is mentioned most.

Authentic Hadiths have come regarding the virtue of Sham and its people. The Quran indicated that blessing is in four places. There is no doubt that the manifestation of Islam and its supporters in it by heart, hand, and tongue is stronger than in others, and in it is a manifestation of faith and suppression of disbelief and hypocrisy not found elsewhere. As for what was mentioned of the Hadith of breaking fast and fasting and that blessing is seventy-one parts in Sham and Iraq as mentioned, we have not heard this from any of the people of knowledge. And Allah knows best). (Al-Fatawa) (1/311). I say: Even if it were established that the mentioned Prophets are in it, it does not necessitate the virtue of seeking to pray in it as some people imagine; rather, it is forbidden most strictly because it is taking graves as mosques, and we have been forbidden from that as preceded. Therefore, Sheikh al-Islam also said, may Allah have mercy on him, in (Al-Fatawa) (4/310): (And what some people do of seeking prayer and supplication at what is said to be the grave of a Prophet or the grave of one of the Companions and relatives or what is close to that, or pressing one's body or part of one's body against the grave or against what is adjacent to the grave of wood and the like, like the one who seeks prayer and supplication in the south-east of the Mosque of Damascus at the place said to be the grave of Hud - which scholars agree is the grave of Mu'awiyah bin Abi Sufyan - or at the wooden likeness said to have the head of Yahya bin Zakariya beneath it and similar things, he is mistaken, an innovator, opposing the Sunnah.

This was narrated in detail in (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi) (12/274): (Sa'id bin Zabban narrated: My father told me from his father from his grandfather from Abu Hind, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: Tamim - meaning Al-Dari - carried from Sham to Medina lamps, oil, and a rope (Muqatt). When he reached Medina, it coincided with Friday night. He ordered a boy called Abu Al-Bazad, so he tied the rope, hung the lamps, poured water and oil in them, and placed the wicks. When the sun set, he ordered Abu Al-Bazad, so he lit them. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, came out to the mosque and found it shining with them. He said: (Who did this?) They said: Tamim Al-Dari, O Messenger of Allah. He said: (You illuminated Islam, may Allah illuminate you in this world and the Hereafter. Verily, if I had a daughter, I would have married her to you). Nawfal bin Al-Harith said: I have a daughter, O Messenger of Allah, named Al-Mughirah bint Nawfal, so do with her what you wish. So he married her to him. Zabban (with Fatha on Zai and Shadda with one dot underneath) Sa'id is unique in being named (1)",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) Thus in Al-Qurtubi. Perhaps the correct is: The father of Sa'id. For you see that Zabban is his father's name. Al-Hafiz Abd al-Ghani bin Sa'id mentioned in (Al-Mu'talif wal-Mukhtalif) (p. 59) that Zabban bin Qa'id's Kunya is Abu Juwayn Hamrawi.",

Also agreed upon. It is apparent that there were no lamps in the mosques by which they could know each other's faces.

But that does not negate the legitimacy of lighting the mosque as long as he, peace and blessings be upon him, encouraged that in the previous Hadith, and practice continued upon it afterwards. We only restricted that (to what is not extravagant) because there is no good in extravagance and because it is a waste of money in vain, and we have been forbidden from it.

Ibn Al-Hajj, may Allah have mercy on him, said in (Al-Madkhal) while discussing the innovations of the night of mid-Sha'ban (1/308): (Do you not see what they have done of excessive extraordinary lighting until not a lamp remains in the mosque nor anything that can be lit except they lit it? They even put ropes on the columns and balconies and hung lamps on them and lit them. The reasoning has preceded for which the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, disliked wiping the Mushaf, the pulpit, and the walls... etc., since that was the cause of the beginning of idol worship. Excessive lighting contains resemblance to fire worshippers in appearance, even if they do not believe that, because fire worshippers light them until when they are strong and radiant, they gather to them with the intention of worshiping them. The Lawgiver, peace and blessings be upon him, urged abandoning Muslims' resemblance to the actions of people of false religions even in their specific dress. Added to that is the gathering of many women, men, and young children who often soil the mosque with their waste, and much noise and clamor which is more severe, more frequent, and greater than the night of the twenty-seventh of Rajab. The evils in that have preceded, and in this night it is more, more hideous, and greater, due to the increase of lighting in it. Look, may Allah have mercy on us and you, at these innovations, how some drag to others until they end up in prohibitions). End of his words.",

Nothing regarding it is authentic from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, nor did he speak of prayer in it. Regarding the lighting, [no] truthful narrator spoke. No one introduced it [except] one playing with the Muhammadan Sharia, desiring the religion of the Majus because fire is their object of worship. The first time this happened was in the time of the Barmakids; they introduced into the religion of Islam what they disguised to the commoners, which is their making the lighting in Sha'ban as if it were from the Sunnahs of faith, while their intent was worshiping fires and establishing their religion, which is the most losing of religions. Even when Muslims prayed, bowed, and prostrated, it was towards the fire they lit. Years and ages passed on that, Baghdad was followed in it by other regions. This is alongside what gathers in that night of men and women and their mixing. It is obligatory on the ruler to prevent them and on the scholar to deter them. Sha'ban was only honored because the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to fast it. The Hadith is authentic regarding his fasting, peace and blessings be upon him, all of Sha'ban or most of it). Then Ibn Abi Shama said (p. 25): (All this is corruption arising from the direction of misguided ascetics, so how about what occurs of the corruption of degenerate sinners and reviving that night with types of outward and inward sins? All of them are because of the lighting exceeding the usual, which is thought to be an act of closeness, while it is assistance in disobedience to Allah Almighty, manifesting evil, and strengthening the rituals of the people of innovation.

The generality of Aisha's hadith indicates starting with the right when exiting the mosque as well. It is possible to say regarding her statement \"as much as he could\" that it is a precaution against what cannot be done with the right side according to Sharia, such as entering the toilet and exiting the mosque, and likewise handling filthy things with the right hand like cleaning oneself (Istinja) and blowing the nose. Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, knew his love, peace be upon him, for what she mentioned either by his informing her of that or by contextual indications.'

Thus, he is not used as proof if he contradicts trustworthy narrators like Ismail bin Ibrahim, who is Ibn Ulayyah the trustworthy Hafiz. Al-Darawardi erred another error where he made the hadith a teaching from the Prophet, peace be upon him, to his daughter Fatimah, while the hadith is her narration from him, peace be upon him, regarding his action, as other narrators reported it. So be aware. Third: From Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, raised to the Prophet with the wording: 'If one of you enters the mosque, let him send peace upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, and let him say: O Allah open for me the doors of Your mercy. And when he exits, let him send peace upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, and let him say: O Allah protect me from the accursed Satan.' Recorded by Ibn Majah (1/260) and Al-Hakim (1/207), and from him Al-Bayhaqi (2/442) and Ibn Al-Sunni (p. 31, no. 84) via the path of Abu Bakr Al-Hanafi: Al-Dahhak bin Uthman narrated to us: Saeed Al-Maqburi narrated to me from him. Al-Hakim said: 'Sahih according to the condition of the Two Sheikhs.' Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, but it is not as they said; rather it is according to the condition of Muslim alone, for Al-Bukhari did not record narrations for Al-Dahhak bin Uthman.",

Perhaps the first narration is closer to being correct and more likely because most narrators from Sulaiman bin Bilal are upon it, and because Al-Darawardi followed him on it without disagreement upon him, unlike the other narrations. And Allah knows best. This, and in Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Al-Darimi in one narration, and Al-Bayhaqi, there is an addition: 'Let him send peace upon the Prophet, peace be upon him' upon entering only. Likewise, Abu Awana recorded it in his Sahih Musnad (Vol 1, p 414) similar to Abu Dawood's narration and added in it: 'And when he exits, let him send peace upon the Prophet, peace be upon him' as in (Nuzul Al-Abrar) (p. 72). Based on this, it is exactly like the hadith of Abu Huraira, and both indicate the obligation of this remembrance. Therefore we said: (And this supplication is obligatory due to his command, peace and blessings be upon him, regarding it in his saying: 'If one of you enters the mosque, let him send peace upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, and let him say: O Allah open for me the doors of Your mercy. And when he exits, let him send peace upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, and let him say: O Allah protect me from the accursed Satan').

I say: The saying of 'recommendation only' requires evidence to divert the command, which apparently implies obligation, to recommendation, and there is no evidence as far as we know. If there were any evidence, Al-Nawawi himself or others would have mentioned it. Therefore, Imam Ibn Hazm held the view of its obligation. He said in (Al-Muhalla) (4/60): 'It is obligatory upon whoever enters the mosque to say: O Allah open for me the doors of Your mercy. And when he exits from it, let him say: O Allah I ask You from Your bounty. This is only one of the conditions of entering the mosque whenever he enters it, not one of the conditions of prayer. The prayer of one who does not say that is valid, but he has disobeyed in leaving his saying what he was commanded with.' Then he cited the hadith via the path of Muslim from Abu Humaid or Abu Usaid. The phrase: 'Let him send peace' did not occur in Muslim's narration as previously indicated. It seems Ibn Hazm did not come across it in the other narrations nor across the hadith of Abu Huraira which contains the two additions; otherwise, he would have mentioned them and stated the obligation of sending peace (Salam) as well. Furthermore, the apparent meaning of the hadith implies the obligation of sending peace upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, only, without sending blessings (Salah) upon him, for that is recommended due to its establishment from his action, peace and blessings be upon him, as preceded. However, it might be said: The Salam in it is general, and he, peace and blessings be upon him, clarified it by his action where he used to combine Salah and Salam, and that is the requirement of His saying: {Indeed...",

So just as sending blessings upon him, peace be upon him, includes sending peace upon him as clarified by the noble verse and as in the Tashahhud, perhaps sending peace upon him includes sending blessings upon him as well when mentioned generally. This is what occurred to me to mention in this place. If it is correct, it is from Allah Almighty, and if it is otherwise, I seek Allah's forgiveness and hope for its correction by those capable of it. Al-Sindi said: 'Sending peace (Salam) upon the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was prescribed when the worshiper enters the mosque and when he exits because he is the cause of his entering the mosque and attaining great good, so he should be mentioned with goodness. Specifying mercy for entry and bounty for exit is because entry is established to acquire mercy and forgiveness, while outside the mosque is the place for seeking provision, which is what is meant by bounty.' (Note): Sheikh Al-Islam said in (Al-Radd 'ala Al-Akhna'i) (p. 150): 'In (Sunan Abu Dawood) and others, it is said upon entering the mosque: (O Allah I ask You for the best entry and the best exit, in the name of Allah we enter and in the name of Allah we exit, and upon Allah we rely).'

Yes, Sheikh Al-Islam commented some of it from Ibn Sirin: 'People used to say when they entered the mosque - then he mentioned Salah and Salam on the Prophet, peace be upon him - and in the name of Allah we entered and in the name of Allah we exited and upon Allah we relied. And they used to say the like of that when they exited.'

The hadith is evidence by its apparent meaning for the obligation of the two Rak'ahs of greeting the mosque, because in the first narration he commanded them, and the command implies obligation. In the other, he forbade sitting before prayer, and that implies prohibition. The Zahiris (Literalists) adopted this apparent meaning, except Ibn Hazm among them, for he explicitly stated in (Al-Muhalla) that it is a Sunnah. It is the opinion of the Majority, and they answered the hadith saying the command in it is for recommendation (Nadb). They argued for that with proofs that do not support what they claimed.

This is a Sahih chain according to the condition of Muslim, and his hadith from Abu Sufyan from Jabir preceded. (4) Among them is Abu Saeed Al-Khudri, and he has two paths: 1 - From Muhammad bin Ajlan from Iyad bin Abdullah bin Abi Sarh: That Abu Saeed Al-Khudri entered on Friday while Marwan was preaching, so he stood to pray. The guards came to make him sit, but he refused until he prayed. When he finished, we came to him and said: May Allah have mercy on you, they almost fell upon you. He said: I would not leave them after something I saw from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. Then he mentioned that a man came on Friday in a shabby state while the Prophet, peace be upon him, was preaching on Friday, so he ordered him and he prayed two Rak'ahs while the Prophet, peace be upon him, was preaching. Recorded by Al-Tirmidhi - and the wording is his - Al-Nasa'i, and Ahmad via paths from him. Also recorded by Al-Tahawi, Ibn Khuzaimah, and Ibn Hibban as in (Al-Fath).

The Bedouin sat at the back of the people. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said to him: 'Did you bow two Rak'ahs?' He said: No. He said: So he ordered him, and he went to the courtyard near the pulpit and bowed two Rak'ahs. Recorded by Ahmad, and its chain is Hasan in corroborations and witnesses. Then Al-Tirmidhi said: 'The practice is upon this according to some people of knowledge; Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq say it. Some of them said: If he enters while the Imam is preaching, he sits and does not pray. This is the opinion of Sufyan Al-Thawri and the people of Kufa. The first opinion is more correct.' I say: Al-Darimi, the author of the (Sunan), also said it. It is as Al-Tirmidhi, may Allah have mercy on him, said, that it is the more correct view. Imam Al-Tahawi, may Allah have mercy on him, went to great lengths to reject this explicit text.

This is because enjoining good is higher than the two Rak'ahs of greeting, so if he is prevented from it, he is prevented from them a fortiori. This is the viewpoint of the Hanafis in their argumentation with the mentioned hadith, as established by Al-Sindi. However, he, may Allah have mercy on him, was not satisfied with that but rejected it saying: 'There is discussion regarding it: First: Because it is reasoning by implication or analogy in opposition to the text, so it is not heard. Second: Because continuing in prayer for one who started it before the sermon is permissible, unlike continuing in enjoining good for one who started it before. So just as the analogy of prayer to enjoining good is not valid in continuation, it is not valid in initiation. And Allah Almighty knows best.' I say: We do not concede that the command [to listen] is higher than the greeting of the mosque; rather we say the opposite, which is the apparent meaning of the text. Meaning: The greeting is higher than enjoining good at that time; therefore, he ordered it and not this, and that is among the proofs of its obligation as established recently. So reflect. Due to the clarity of the proof in this issue, I refrain from addressing the remaining aspects and opinions pointed to earlier and refuting them, and I refer whoever wants to view them in detail to (Fath Al-Bari) and (Nayl Al-Awtar). I only point out here what was narrated as raised (Marfu') which, if authentic, would be a proof for the Hanafis. It is what Al-Tabarani recorded in (Al-Kabir) from Ibn Umar raised to the Prophet: 'If one of you enters the mosque while the Imam is preaching on the pulpit, there is no prayer and no speech until the Imam finishes.'

The apparent meaning of the first Hadith is that this prayer was for the sake of sitting in the mosque, not for arrival from travel. However, its two witnesses are explicit - especially the latter of them - that it was for arrival from travel. Similar to it is the Hadith of Jabir coming above. Therefore, Al-Nawawi said in (Sharh Muslim) commenting on it and on the Hadith of Ka'b: (In these Hadiths is the recommendation of two Rak'ahs for the one arriving from his travel in the mosque upon his first arrival. This prayer is intended for the arrival from travel, not that it is Tahiyyat Al-Masjid (greeting of the mosque), and the mentioned Hadiths are explicit regarding what I mentioned). Ibn Al-Qayyim said in the context of mentioning the rulings and benefits contained in the story of the three who were left behind: (And among them is that the Sunnah for the one arriving from travel is to enter the town in a state of Wudu and to begin with the House of Allah before his house, pray two Rak'ahs in it, then sit for the Muslims, then go to his family). (And he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered that, so care should be given to it. Jabir bin Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: (We were on a journey with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and when we arrived in Medina he said to me: Go to the mosque and pray two Rak'ahs in it [He said: So I entered and prayed then returned]).)",

I said: O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, if I were sitting before anyone else from the people of the world, I would have seen that I would exit from his anger. I have been given argumentation skills.

Rather, it bears the opposite possibility, and there is nothing in it to repel this possibility. Since probability has entered it, deduction by it falls. And Allah knows best. Therefore, Al-Shawkani said after refuting all what they argued with: (If you know this, it becomes clear to you that the apparent view is what the Zahiris said of obligation). Al-Amir Al-San'ani preceded him in choosing obligation in (Subul Al-Salam). He said: (Due to the abundance of commands reported regarding it). I say: This is supported by what follows of his command, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, while he was on the pulpit delivering the Friday sermon to Sulaik Al-Ghatfani for this prayer, then he ordered that to everyone who enters the mosque even if the Imam is delivering the sermon. This is among the strongest evidences for its obligation due to several matters: First: His interrupting the sermon, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. Second: His command for it after Sulaik sat down. Third - and it is the strongest -: That he ordered it during the sermon, for it is known that in this state it is not permissible for anyone to enjoin good or forbid evil, due to his saying, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him:",

Perhaps between them is Muhammad bin Sulayman Al-Harrani, the grandfather of this Sulayman, for he narrates from him. It has a witness from the Hadith of the freed slave of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri. Ahmad extracted it: Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Al-Zubayr told us, he said: Ubaidullah bin Abdullah bin Mawhab told us, he said: My uncle told me - meaning Ubaidullah bin Abdul Rahman bin Mawhab - from a freed slave of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, he said: While I was with Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, when we entered the mosque, behold a man sitting in the middle of the mosque squatting (Muhtabiyan), interlacing his fingers into each other. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, signaled to him, but the man did not notice the signal of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, turned to Abu Sa'id and said: (If one of you is in the mosque, let him not interlace, for interlacing is from Satan. Indeed, one of you remains in prayer as long as he is in the mosque until he exits from it). Then he narrated it from Waki' from Ubaidullah with it. Ibn Abi Shaybah extracted it from him as in (Al-Umdah). Al-Hafiz said: (In its chain is a weak and an unknown person). I say: The first is Ubaidullah, who is Ibn Abdul Rahman bin Abdullah bin Mawhab. He said: In (Al-Taqrib):",

From this you know that the statement of Al-Mundhiri and then Al-Haythami: (Narrated by Ahmad with a good chain) is not good. Yes, the Hadith is good (Hasan), rather authentic (Sahih) by the sum of these paths. It has been contradicted by the Hadith of Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, led us in one of the two afternoon prayers (Dhuhr or Asr). He prayed two Rak'ahs with us then said Taslim. Then he stood up to a piece of wood placed in the mosque and leaned on it as if he was angry, and he placed his right hand over his left and interlaced his fingers... The Hadith. Al-Bukhari extracted it and titled it (Chapter: Interlacing fingers in the mosque and elsewhere). In it is evidence for the permissibility of interlacing fingers in the mosque. Either it is said: This is specific to him, peace and blessings be upon him, based on what is established in the principles (Usul) that his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, takes precedence over his action in case of contradiction. Or his action clarifies his prohibition, that it is not for prohibition (Tahrim) but for dislike (Karahah). Perhaps this is closer. And Allah knows best. See (Nayl Al-Awtar).",

Abu Al-Zubair narrated it from Jabir with the wording: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade eating onion and leek. And he said: There was no garlic in our land at that time.

Al-Hafiz means by the interpretation referred to the narration of Al-Bukhari via Abu Asim who said: Juraij informed us with it with the wording: (Whoever eats from this plant - meaning garlic - let him not come near us in our mosque). This is a narration of Muslim from two other paths from Ibn Juraij. Then Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood, and Al-Bayhaqi extracted it via Ibn Wahb: Yunus informed me from Ibn Shihab who said: Ata bin Abi Rabah told me with it. In it is the second addition and its wording: (Whoever eats garlic or onion, let him keep away from us) or (or let him keep away from our mosque and sit in his house). And that he was brought a pot containing vegetables from legumes and found a smell from it, so he asked and was informed of what legumes were in it.

Some people dismounted and ate from it, and others did not eat. We went to him, and he called those who did not eat onion and delayed the others) until its smell went away.

So his saying: (our mosque) means the place prepared for prayer during his stay there, or the intent by mosque is the genus and the addition is to the Muslims, i.e., let him not approach the mosque of the Muslims. This is supported by the second wording: our mosques. I say: This is strengthened by the reasoning of harming Muslims and angels, and this is realized in every mosque as is obvious. Then this reasoning necessitates two matters not explicitly stated in the Hadith: First: Appending gathering places of worship to mosques, such as the prayer place of Eid and funerals and the like. This is also supported by the generality of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (Let him not approach us nor pray with us). Al-Hafiz said: (Some appended them by analogy, and holding to this generality is better. Its parallel is his saying: (and let him sit in his house)).

Therefore, Ibn Al-Munir said in (Al-Hashiyah): (Some of our companions appended the leper and others to the garlic eater in prevention from entering the mosque). He said: (This is open to question because the garlic eater introduced this impediment upon himself by his choice, while the leper's ailment is heavenly).

This is supported by the fact that when Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah found the smell of garlic on him, peace and blessings be upon him, and objected to him, and he showed him his excuse - which is that he only ate it out of hunger - he excused him as preceded in the seventh Hadith. So the leper and the like are excused a fortiori (1). Al-Hafiz said: (Some appended to that one who has halitosis in his mouth or has a wound with a smell.

In summary, what is doubtless and almost agreed upon among scholars is: That the reason of harm necessitates preventing everyone who consumes something with a foul smell, whether food, drink, or otherwise, from entering, provided he is choosing that, not compelled like medication or a profession like butchery and the like. I say: It is almost agreed upon because Ibn Hazm, may Allah have mercy on him, disagreed in it, where he said: (Whoever eats garlic, onion, or leek, it is obligatory on him not to pray in the mosque until the smell goes away, and it is obligatory to remove him from the mosque if he enters before the cessation of the smell. If he prays in the mosque like that, he has no prayer. And no one is prevented from the mosque other than those we mentioned, neither one with halitosis, nor a leper, nor one with a disability). Then he cited the Hadith of Umar coming next and the Hadith of Jabir, then said: (Ali said: He, peace be upon him, did not prevent anyone from attending mosques other than those we mentioned {And he does not speak from [his own] inclination} {And never is your Lord forgetful}). I say: This is rigidity from him on the wording without looking at the meaning, for the reasoning in Jabir's Hadith by 'harm' indicates clearly the prohibition of everything whose smell harms, according to the detail we mentioned just now.

Indeed, it is a severe punishment that these and their likes are prevented from entering mosques where believers gather and close angels attend, thus being deprived of witnessing the abundant good which contains multiplication of prayer by twenty-seven degrees. More severe than that is that they be expelled from them - if they enter - forcibly and by power, as the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to do as will come. Indeed in that is a lesson {So take warning, O people of vision} [Al-Hashr / 2]. He said in (Al-Fath): (Benefit): The ruling of the courtyard of the mosque and what is close to it is its ruling. Therefore, if he, peace and blessings be upon him, found its smell in the mosque, he would order the one from whom it was found to be expelled to Al-Baqi' as established in Muslim).

Rather, this is the apparent meaning because the cause of prevention is the presence of the smell, and it does not last this period). Then the prohibition in the previous Hadiths implies forbiddance (Tahrim). The literalists (Zahiriyyah) went to this, including Ibn Hazm, and the text of his words on that has preceded shortly. It is the truth, Allah willing, for several reasons: First: That the default in prohibition is forbiddance, so it is not permissible to depart from it except for evidence or context, and there is nothing of that here. Second: That it was coupled with the emphasized Nun of confirmation, and that confirms the prohibition and forbiddance. Third: That it forfeits congregational prayer, which is obligatory according to the most correct opinions as will be explained in its place, so leaving it is forbidden. If entering the mosque for those mentioned in the Hadith were not more forbidden, the Wise Lawgiver would not have punished them by preventing them from it and would not have wasted on them the multiplication mentioned just now. And Allah Almighty says: {Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward} [An-Nisa / 40]. He, Glorified and Exalted, knows best. From what we mentioned, you know that arguing with the Hadith that congregation is not an individual obligation is not correct, because the Lawgiver only forbade them from it as a punishment for them for coming to it with what is a greater crime than leaving it without excuse.",

Therefore we said: (It is obligatory on the capable to expel them from the mosque due to the Hadith of Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: (Indeed you, O people, eat two plants which I do not see as anything but foul: this onion and garlic.

He said: And this is open to question because the garlic eater introduced this impediment upon himself by his choice, while the leper's ailment is heavenly. He said: But his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: out of hunger or otherwise. Indicates equality between them. End quote.

So the Hadith does not indicate the meaning Al-Bukhari went to, due to the possibility that he, peace and blessings be upon him, did not know that need and hunger were what drove them to eat. Indeed, this is the apparent meaning because if he, peace and blessings be upon him, knew that, he would have excused them as in this Hadith of Al-Mughirah.

Its narrators are trustworthy except this Abd al-Hamid, who is unknown as in (Al-Taqrib). His saying: (and that a man settles in the place in the mosque as a camel settles). Al-Khattabi said in (Al-Ma'alim) followed by Ibn Al-Athir in (Al-Nihayah): (It has two aspects: One: That a man frequents a known place in the mosque not praying except in it, like a camel does not seek shelter from its resting place except a smooth kneeling place it has settled in and taken as a resting place, not kneeling except in it. The other aspect: That he kneels on his knees before his hands when he wants to prostrate, like the kneeling of a camel on the place it settled in. And that he not drop down in his prostration bending his knees until he places them on the ground with stillness and deliberation). I say: Ibn Al-Athir did not mention his saying: (And that he not drop down...) etc. Perhaps the reason for that is it being contradictory to what preceded it where he said: (That he kneels on his knees... like the kneeling of a camel). And in this he says: (bending his knees...) etc. It seems Al-Khattabi, may Allah have mercy on him, sees that the consideration is not placing the knees before the hands, but rather the thud resulting from placing them so on the ground as heard from the camel.

I have clarified this in (Al-Ta'liqat Al-Jiyad 'ala Zad Al-Ma'ad) and its explanation will also come in the appropriate place in this book, Allah willing.

A group of commentators asserted it. Some limited themselves to it and did not address mentioning the second aspect, indicating it is not considered, like Al-Munawi and others.

Also, if this meaning were intended, the prohibition would not have been specific to the place in the mosque. Since he mentioned [place], it indicated that the intent is the first.

Muhammad bin Ismail (meaning Al-Bukhari) said: (I saw Ahmad and Ishaq - and he mentioned others - using the hadith of Amr bin Shu'aib as evidence. Muhammad said: Shu'aib bin Muhammad heard from his grandfather Abdullah bin Amr. Abu Isa said: Those who spoke against the hadith of Amr bin Shu'aib only weakened him because he narrates from his grandfather's scroll; as if they saw that he did not hear these hadiths from his grandfather. Ali bin Abdullah said: It was mentioned from Yahya bin Saeed that he said: The hadith of Amr bin Shu'aib is flimsy with us). The truth is that his hadith (is not from the highest categories of Sahih, rather it is of the Hasan type) as Al-Dhahabi said in (Al-Mizan) after recounting the sayings of the Imams about him. The defect raised by those who defected it claiming he did not hear from his grandfather is refuted by narrations established wherein he explicitly stated hearing from him, as clarified by the researcher Ahmad Muhammad Shakir in his commentary on Al-Tirmidhi, so let whoever wishes review it.",

Its chain is Sahih to Amr, so whoever authenticates his copy authenticates it). Perhaps it is in Ibn Khuzaima via a path other than Ibn Ajlan's path which Al-Tirmidhi narrated from, for I do not believe Al-Hafiz would authenticate a chain containing Ibn Ajlan. And Allah knows best. Al-Khattabi said in (Al-Ma'alim): (Al-Hilaq): with a Kasra on the Ha and Fatha on the Lam: plural of Halqah (circle). Some of our Sheikhs used to narrate it as (forbade Al-Halq) with a Sukun on the Lam, and he told me that he remained for forty years not shaving his head before the prayer on Friday. So I said to him: It is only (Al-Hilaq) plural of Halqah. He only disliked gathering before the prayer for knowledge and discussion, and commanded to be occupied with prayer and listening to the sermon and dhikr. When finished, gathering and forming circles is after that. He said: You have relieved me, may He reward me well. He was one of the righteous, may Allah have mercy on him.

Second: That the gathering for Friday prayer is a grave matter; one who attends it cannot concern himself with anything else until he finishes. People forming circles before prayer suggests heedlessness of the command they were called to. In (Sharh Al-Sunnah): The hadith implies the dislike of forming circles on Friday before prayer for discussing knowledge; rather, one should occupy oneself with Dhikr, prayer, and listening to the sermon, and there is no harm after that. In (Al-Ihya'): Sitting in circles before prayer is disliked). In (Nayl Al-Awtar): (The majority interpreted the prohibition as dislike (Karahah), because it might cut the rows, while they are commanded to come early on Friday and align in rows, the first then the first. Al-Tahawi said: Forming circles which is forbidden before prayer is when it covers the mosque and dominates it, then it is disliked; otherwise, there is no harm. The restriction to 'before prayer' indicates its permissibility afterwards for knowledge and Dhikr. The restriction to 'Friday' indicates its permissibility on other days, as in the agreed-upon hadith from Abu Waqid Al-Laithi who said: While the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was in the mosque, three people came. Two approached the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and one went away. As for one of them, he saw a gap in the circle and sat in it, and the other sat behind them... The hadith. As for forming circles in the mosque for worldly matters, it is not permissible. In the hadith of Ibn Masud: There will be in the end of times people who sit in mosques in circles, their desires are the world; do not sit with them for Allah has no need in them.

You have seen that Abu Al-Khalil is accused of fabrication, so it is inconceivable that he would preface what he narrated with the word (An) [From]. This and what preceded indicate that the hadith is in Ibn Hibban from another path. Nevertheless, I personally cannot rely on merely Ibn Hibban's authentication before seeing its chain and narrators, due to what we know of his leniency in that, as we have pointed out repeatedly on various occasions. If we find it and judge it Sahih or at least Hasan, it must be mentioned in the main text of the book. And Allah is the Guardian of success (1).

    "text": "This hadith apparently indicates the permissibility of raising the voice in the mosque for a worldly purpose because he, peace be upon him, did not rebuke the disputants for raising their voices. However, Al-Bukhari narrated before it from Umar what contradicts it: From Al-Saib bin Yazid who said: (I was standing in the mosque when a man threw pebbles at me. I looked and it was Umar bin Al-Khattab. He said: Go and bring me these two. So I brought them to him. He said: Who are you or where are you from? They said: From the people of Taif. He said: If you were from the people of this city, I would have hurt you [beaten you]; you raise your voices in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah?) Al-Bukhari titled it: (Chapter: Raising the voice in mosques). Al-Hafiz said: (He indicated by the title the disagreement regarding that. Malik disliked it absolutely whether in knowledge or otherwise. Others differentiated between what relates to a religious purpose or worldly benefit and what has no benefit. Al-Bukhari cited in the chapter the hadith of Umar indicating prohibition and the hadith of Ka'b indicating its absence, hinting that prohibition is for what has no benefit, and its absence is for what necessity compels to. The discussion on it has preceded in the Chapter of Litigation. Hadiths have been narrated prohibiting raising voices in mosques, but they are weak; Ibn Majah extracted some of them, so it seems the author alluded to them). He said in the chapter he alluded to: (In the hadith is the permissibility of raising the voice in the mosque, and it is so unless it becomes excessive. The author has dedicated a chapter for it coming soon. What is reported from Malik is forbidding it in the mosque...",

    "text": "a contextual indication to interpret prohibition as dislike. Some Shafi'i scholars held that buying and selling in the mosque is not disliked, but the hadiths refute them. The companions of Abu Hanifa differentiated between if it becomes dominant and frequent, then it is disliked, or if it is little, then there is no dislike; a distinction for which there is no evidence). I say: Among those who explicitly stated permissibility is Ibn Hazm in (Al-Muhalla), his text being: (Selling is permissible in the mosque. Allah Almighty said: {And Allah has permitted trade} [Al-Baqarah / 275]. No prohibition came regarding that except via the path of Amr bin Shu'aib from his father from his grandfather, and it is a scroll). I say: The hadith of Amr bin Shu'aib has disagreement, and the most likely view is that he is Hasan in hadith as previously explained. Furthermore, this hadith of Abu Huraira refutes him, and its chain is Sahih according to him, for he narrated the second part of it as preceded and used it as evidence for the prohibition of announcing lost property in the mosque. So his school should have been the prohibition of buying and selling in the mosque, were it not that he did not connect the hadith completely but rather abbreviated it. Al-San'ani said in his (Sharh): (It contains evidence for the prohibition of buying and selling in mosques, and that one who sees that in it must say to each of the seller and buyer: May Allah not make your trade profitable. He says it aloud to rebuke the doer of that. The reason is his saying previously: For mosques were not built for that). Sheikh Ali Al-Qari said in (Al-Mirqat): (Our scholars permitted buying for the one in I'tikaf (seclusion) without bringing the merchandise.

Thus Al-Hafiz judged Al-Husayni to be in error and claimed that the biographee is Al-Qasim bin Abdul Rahman Al-Muzani, not Al-Abbas bin Abdul Rahman Al-Madani. It appears that the origin of this difference arose from the difference in copies of (Al-Musnad) regarding the name of the biographee. This is supported by the fact that our printed copy agrees completely with what Al-Husayni mentioned. We do not know the correct version of that because the matter requires scrutiny of many corrected copies of (Al-Musnad), and how can we have that? Perhaps the scholar Professor Ahmad Muhammad Shakir has investigated that in his new edition of (Al-Musnad). However, it seems more likely to me that it is Al-Abbas bin Abdul Rahman because it is so in Al-Daraqutni's narration, even if it differed in his attribution (Nisbah) as indicated earlier; that does not prevent preferring what the two narrations agreed upon. In Al-Hafiz's words, there is another contradiction to what is in our copy of (Al-Musnad), as he said previously: (From Hakim regarding perfume in mosques). Hakim has no hadith with this meaning in (Al-Musnad), although he narrated many hadiths in two places in it. But it is most likely that there is a distortion in our copy of (Al-Ta'jeel) and that the original is: (Regarding Hudud in mosques). And Allah knows best.",

So he entered the mosque and saw sputum in the Qibla of the mosque, so he scraped it off. Then he turned to the people angrily and said: Would any of you be pleased if someone spat in his face? Indeed, when one of you faces the Qibla, he is facing his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, and the angel is on his right. So let him not spit to his right nor in his Qibla, and let him spit to his left or under his foot. If an urge hastens him, let him say like this - and Ibn Ajlan described that - spitting into his garment then rubbing parts of it against each other. Narrated by Abu Dawood, Al-Hakim, and Ahmad from Ibn Ajlan from Iyad bin Abdullah from him. Al-Hakim said: (Sahih on the condition of Muslim). Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, but it is not so; rather it is only Hasan, not on the condition of Muslim as explained repeatedly. In (Al-Targhib): (Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his (Sahih). In a narration by him similarly except he said in it: (For Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, is in front of you in your prayers, so do not direct anything of harm in front of you... The Hadith). Ibn Khuzaymah titled it: (Chapter on the prohibition of directing anything to which the name of harm applies towards the Qibla in prayer). I say: The Hadith has another path from Abu Sa'id which will come shortly, if Allah the Exalted wills. It indicates the prohibition of spitting in the mosque towards the Qibla from two aspects: First: His anger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, at them when he saw the spit in the Qibla.",

Al-Qurtubi said: His turning to the people angrily indicates the prohibition of spitting on the Qibla wall, and that it is expiated by burying it and scraping it off, as he said regarding the whole mosque: Spitting in the mosque is a sin and its expiation is burying it.

Ahmad extracted it: Ibn Abi Adi told us from Ibn Ishaq, and Ya'qub: My father told us from Ibn Ishaq: Abdullah bin Muhammad told me, Ya'qub said: Ibn Abi Atiq, from Amir bin Sa'd, narrated to him from his father Sa'd. This is a Hasan chain; all its men are trustworthy men of the two Sheikhs except Ibn Ishaq, and he is Good (Hasan) in Hadith. In (Al-Majma'): (Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Ya'la and its men are trustworthy). Al-Hafiz said: (Narrated by Ahmad with a Hasan chain). These Hadiths indicate what the previous Hadith of Abu Huraira indicated, which is the permissibility of spitting in the mosque - upon need of course - if he buries it. Al-Hafiz Al-Iraqi said in (Sharh Al-Taqrib): (Abu Al-Walid Al-Baji said: If he spits in the mosque and covers his spit, there is no sin upon him. Al-Qurtubi also narrated from Ibn Makki that it is only a sin for the one who spits in it and does not bury it. Al-Qurtubi said: What indicates the correctness of this is his saying in the Hadith of Abu Dharr: (And I found in their bad deeds sputum being in the mosque not buried). So the ruling of bad deed was not established for it by mere placement in the mosque, but by that and its remaining unburied. I say: His permission for that in the Hadith of the chapter (meaning the previous Hadith of Abu Huraira) by his saying: (Or under his feet and bury it) also indicates it.

Al-Nawawi disagreed with that and exaggerated, saying in (Sharh Muslim): (Know that spitting in the mosque is a sin absolutely, whether one needs to spit or does not need to, rather he should spit in his garment. If he spits in the mosque, he has committed the sin, and he must expiate this sin by burying the spit. This is the correct view, that spitting is a sin as stated by the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. The scholars and Qadi Iyad said: It contains a false statement, the summary of which is that spitting is not a sin except regarding the one who does not bury it, but as for the one who intends to bury it, it is not a sin. He used false things as evidence for it, so his saying this is a mistake contrary to the text of the Hadith). Al-Hafiz said: (The summary of the dispute is that here are two generalities that conflicted, which are his saying: (Spitting in the mosque is a sin) and his saying: (And let him spit to his left or under his foot). So Al-Nawawi makes the first general and restricts the second to when he is not in the mosque. And Al-Qadi contrarily makes the second general and restricts the first to the one who does not intend to bury it. A group agreed with Al-Qadi, among them Ibn Makki in (Al-Tanqib), Al-Qurtubi in (Al-Mufhim), and others. Witnessing for them). Then he mentioned the Hadith of Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas, then the Hadith of Abu Umamah, and said: (It is clearer than it in intent). Then the Hadith of Abu Dharr and Al-Qurtubi's speech on it preceded.

    "text": "That he expectorated in the mosque one night and forgot to bury it until he returned to his home. So he took a torch of fire then came and sought it until he buried it. Then he said: Praise be to Allah who did not write a sin against me tonight. This indicates that the sin is specific to the one who leaves it, not the one who buries it. The reason for prohibition guides to it, which is the believer being harmed by it. What indicates that its generality is restricted: The permissibility of that in the garment even if he was in the mosque without dispute. In Abu Dawood from the Hadith of Abdullah bin Al-Shikhkhir that he prayed with the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and spat under his left foot then rubbed it with his shoe. Its chain is Sahih and its origin is in Muslim. The apparent is that this was in the mosque, so it supports what preceded). I say: Al-Nawawi's restriction of the second Hadith which Al-Hafiz pointed to, to when he is not in the mosque, is false because it was reported regarding the mosque specifically as preceded from Al-Iraqi. So how is it permissible to restrict it to other than what the Hadith was reported for? The truth is that there is no contradiction between the two Hadiths at all: The first Hadith - and what is in its meaning - stated that spitting in the mosque is a sin if he does not bury it. But if he buries it, it is not a sin because it - meaning the burial - is a good deed that wiped out the sin of spitting as in the Hadith of Abu Umamah. The second Hadith - meaning the previous Hadith of Abu Huraira - only permitted spitting with burial as preceded. So if he does not bury it, he has committed the sin inevitably. Thus, the two Hadiths are in agreement. And praise be to Allah.",

    "text": "Then Al-Hafiz Al-Iraqi said: (In his saying: (let him bury it). What implies that the license for spitting in the mosque is when the mosque's furnishing is pebbles or dust, not when it is marble, tiles, rugs, or mats. The author of (Al-Mufhim) narrated from some of them saying: We heard from some of our Sheikhs that this is only permissible if there is nothing in the mosque but dust or sand as their mosques were in the first era. As for if there are rugs in the mosque and mats of value which spitting spoils and dirties, then it is not permissible out of respect for the angels. I say: Rubbing it with the shoe has been reported instead of burying in what Muslim narrated from the Hadith of Abdullah bin Al-Shikhkhir, who said: I prayed with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and saw him expectorate and rub it with his shoe. This also bears possibility of being in dust or pebbles, so burying it in dust is achieved by rubbing it. Al-Baji said: He does not have the right to spit on the ground and rub it with his foot because that dirties the place for whoever wants to sit in it. I say: Abu Dawood narrated from the narration of Abu Sa'id (so in the original, and correct: Abu Sa'd), he said: I saw Wathilah bin Al-Asqa' in the mosque of Damascus spitting on the reed mat (Buri) then he wiped it with his foot. It was said to him: Why did you do that? He said: Because I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, doing it. Al-Buri: The mat made of reeds, said by Al-Harawi in (Al-Gharibain). Based on this, it is not spoiled by that. And the Hadith is also not authentic).

It was reported in some paths of the Hadith and others what indicates that a woman's prayer in her house is better than her prayer in the mosque). I say: So he mentioned the last addition and what is in its meaning which we referred to. Then he said: (The reason her prayer in concealment is better is the realization of safety in it from Fitnah. This is confirmed after the existence of what women introduced of Tabarruj [display] and adornment. Hence Aisha said what she said. Some held onto Aisha's saying for the absolute prevention of women. This is open to question since the change of ruling does not result from that because she suspended it on a condition that did not exist based on a conjecture she thought, saying: If he saw, he would have prevented. It is said in reply: He did not see and did not prevent. So the ruling continued. Even Aisha did not explicitly state prevention, although her speech implies she saw prevention. Also, Allah Glory be to Him knew what they would introduce, yet He did not reveal to His Prophet to prevent them. If what they introduced necessitated preventing them from mosques, preventing them from other places like markets would be more appropriate. Also, the introduction [of Tabarruj] only occurred from some women, not all of them. If prevention is determined, let it be for those who introduced it. It is better to look at what corruption is feared from, so it is avoided due to his indication, peace and blessings be upon him, to that by preventing perfuming and adornment, as well as the restriction to night as preceded). I say: This restriction indicates that permission is only commanded for husbands if their request to go out to the mosque is at night. But if it is during the day, they are not commanded to [permit]; if they wish they permit, and if they wish they prevent.

This involves accusing the narrator of illusion and attributing deficiency to him without any proof, and the implication is not hidden. Second: That his saying: (from the mosque) is not from the core of the Hadith nor from his speech, peace and blessings be upon him, but rather from Aisha's speech, attached to her saying: He said. Al-Nawawi stated in (Sharh Muslim) quoting Al-Qadi. So the origin of the Hadith according to them is like this: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to me from the mosque: (Hand me the Khumrah). This is contrary to the apparent meaning of the Hadith. It is very unlikely that the origin of the Hadith is what they mentioned, then all narrators agree on narrating it in a form that does not come to mind except that his saying: (from the mosque) is from his speech, peace and blessings be upon him, and that it is attached to (Hand me). Supporting what we mentioned is that the authors of the four Sunan except Al-Nasa'i titled the Hadith with what its apparent meaning indicates, saying: (Chapter: The menstruating woman handing something from the mosque). Al-Tirmidhi said: (Aisha's Hadith is Hasan Sahih. It is the saying of the generality of the people of knowledge; we know of no difference among them in that: That there is no harm in a menstruating woman handling something from the mosque).

This is a subtle understanding and restricting the Hadith with what is not in it indicating it. Perhaps Al-Khattabi is among those who see that a menstruating woman has no right to enter the mosque due to evidence he established, so he restricted the Hadith with it. This would be acceptable if the evidence were authentic, but it is not authentic as will come. So the Hadith should be left on its generality. What supports the generality and absolute nature has come. The Imam said: Sufyan told us from Manbudh from his mother who said: I was with Maimunah, and Ibn Abbas came to her. She said: O my son, why is your head disheveled? He said: Umm Ammar who combs me is menstruating. She said: O my son, and where is the menses from the hand? The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to enter upon one of us while she was menstruating, place his head in her lap, and recite the Quran while she was menstruating. Then one of us would take her Khumrah and place it in the mosque. O my son, and where is the menses from the hand?

Extracted by Ibn Majah and Ibn Abi Hatim in (Al-Ilal), both via Abu Nu'aym: Ibn Abi Ghunyah told us from Abu Al-Khattab Al-Hajari from Mahduj with it. He added in (Al-Ilal): (Except for the Prophet, his wives, Ali, and Fatimah bint Muhammad). He said in (Al-Zawa'id): (Weak chain: Mahduj was not declared trustworthy, and Abu Al-Khattab is unknown). Ibn Hazm said likewise regarding Abu Al-Khattab and said regarding (Mahduj) that he is: (Fallen, narrating conundrums from Jasrah). Then Ibn Abi Hatim said: (Abu Zur'ah said: They say: From Jasrah from Umm Salamah. The correct is from Aisha). In it is an indication that Mahduj was not alone in it, which is the case. Ibn Hazm said: (We narrated it via Abd al-Wahhab from Ata Al-Khaffaf from Ibn Abi Ghunyah from Isma'il from Jasrah bint Dajajah from Umm Salamah with it, and it contains the addition). Then Ibn Hazm rejected it saying: (Ata Al-Khaffaf is Ata bin Muslim: Munkar al-Hadith, and Isma'il is unknown). I say: Thus in (Al-Muhalla): (Abd al-Wahhab from Ata Al-Khaffaf). And in its margin: (In the Yemeni copy: Abd al-Wahhab bin Ata Al-Khaffaf, which is an error).",

Ibn Hazm said: Abd al-Wahhab bin Ata is Munkar al-Hadith and Isma'il is unknown. The matter is not as Abu Muhammad [meaning Ibn Hazm] said, for Ibn Ma'in said: He is trustworthy... Salih bin Muhammad said: They denounced a Hadith from Al-Khaffaf which he narrated for Thawr bin Yazid from Makhul from Kuraib from Ibn Abbas regarding the virtue of Al-Abbas, and they did not denounce other than it... As for Isma'il, if he is Isma'il bin Raja' bin Rushd Al-Zubaidi, he mentioned in the biography of Ibn Abi Utbah (thus, perhaps the original: Ghunyah as in (Al-Muhalla), although Utbah also occurred in Ibn al-Qayyim's quotation from him here, Allah knows best) that he narrated from this Isma'il, and did not mention any Isma'il other than him among his Sheikhs, so he is trustworthy, Muslim narrated for him in (Al-Sahih). After all, this exception (meaning the preceding addition) is false, fabricated, an addition by some extremist Shi'as, and Ibn Majah did not extract it in the Hadith). In summary, Ibn Hazm only softened his speech regarding (Ata bin Muslim Al-Khaffaf) as his statement mentioned just now is explicit. Ibn al-Qayyim thought he meant his son Abd al-Wahhab bin Ata, so he began refuting Ibn Hazm and citing the statements of Imams praising him. He is undoubtedly in better condition than his father Ata, as becomes clear by reviewing the statements of Imams regarding them both. In (Al-Taqrib):",

However, it is not clear to me whether the narrator of the Hadith from Ibn Abi Ghunyah is the father or the son, due to the difference in copies as preceded, although the commentator on (Al-Muhalla), Judge Ahmad Muhammad Shakir, asserted the first and deemed the opposing copy erroneous. Perhaps his proof for that is Ibn Hazm's discussion on Ata rather than Abd al-Wahhab. Against this arises this question: Who is this Abd al-Wahhab? If it is said: He is the son of the mentioned Ata, we say we did not find anyone mentioning him among the narrators from his father. If it is someone else, I did not know him. And Allah knows best. In any case, the pivot of this Hadith is Jasrah, as in the ones before it. She is not famous for trustworthiness and integrity such that the soul is reassured in using her report as independent proof. None of the early scholars whose authentication is proof authenticated her; rather Al-Bukhari criticized her as will come. Therefore, a group of Hadith scholars weakened her Hadith, pointed out by Al-Khattabi in (Al-Ma'alim). Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haqq said: (It is not established due to its chain). Ibn al-Qattan critiqued him with what is insufficient and unsatisfactory, saying, as in (Nasb al-Rayah): (Jasrah bint Dajajah is a Tabi'iyah. Al-Bukhari's saying in (Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir):",

He mentioned in (Al-Tahdhib) among the narrators from her: Mahduj, who is unknown as preceded, and Umar bin Umair bin Mahduj, and I did not find a biography for him. In summary, everyone who narrated from Jasrah is not known for integrity - except Aflt - so how can his narration from her be an authentication for her? Yes, Al-Ijli and Ibn Hibban explicitly authenticated her, as he mentioned her in (Al-Thiqat). His leniency in authentication, as well as Al-Ijli's, is known to those who follow their speech on differed-upon narrators. Therefore you see Al-Hafiz did not rely on their authentication despite quoting it from them in (Al-Tahdhib). He said in (Al-Taqrib): (She is acceptable). Meaning her Hadith is weak if she is alone, as he mentioned in the introduction, which is his saying: (The Sixth: Who has no Hadith except a little, and nothing is established regarding him for which his Hadith should be abandoned.

This is from the hadith of Anas as well.

    "text": "(This hadith (meaning: the hadith of Abu Qatada) was used as evidence for the permissibility of bringing children into mosques, but it is open to discussion due to the possibility that the child was left in a house near the mosque such that his crying could be heard). I say: This possibility is far-fetched, especially with the first hadith of Anas: (He hears the crying of the child with his mother), for its apparent meaning - rather it is a text stating - that the child was with his mother in the mosque. So the mentioned possibility is invalid. In these hadiths is the permissibility of bringing children into mosques, even if they are small and stumble in their walk, even if crying is possible, because the Prophet, peace be upon him, approved that and did not deny it. Rather, he prescribed for Imams to shorten the recitation due to a child's crying, fearing hardship on his family. Perhaps the wisdom in that is accustoming them to obedience and attending the congregation from a young age. For those scenes they see in the mosques and what they hear - of Dhikr, Quran recitation, Takbir, Tahmid, and Tasbih - have a strong effect on their souls - without them realizing - which does not disappear, or is difficult to disappear, when they reach maturity and enter the battlefield of life and its adornments. Similar to this is the Adhan in the ear of the newborn. The researcher Ibn al-Qayyim said in (Tuhfat al-Mawlud): (The secret of the Adhan - and Allah knows best - is that the first thing to strike the human hearing are words organizing the grandeur and majesty of the Lord, and the Testification (Shahada) by which one first enters Islam...",

It is not impossible that the effect of the Adhan reaches his heart and affects him even if he does not perceive it... etc.). Perhaps modern psychology supports the influence on a small child, even in the cradle, by what he hears and sees. I imagine I read a useful research on this subject by some writer, but I do not recall now who it is or in which book it is. As for older children, their being influenced by that is clear and accepted. However, if there are any among them who play in the mosques and run, their fathers and guardians must discipline and educate them, or the custodian and servant must expel them. On this basis is the action mentioned by Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir: (Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, if he saw children playing in the mosque, would hit them with the light whip (Durrah), and he used to inspect the mosque after Isha and leave no one in it). As for the hadith: (Keep your mosques free of your children), it is weak according to Ibn Hajar, Ibn Kathir, and others, so it does not stand against the preceding hadiths. Its verification has preceded in the discussion on it under the first paragraph of (Etiquettes of Mosques).

This is refuted by the fact that Aisha used it as evidence when they denied her order to bring the funeral into the mosque. They also answered that the matter settled on abandoning that because those who denied Aisha were from the Companions. This is refuted by the fact that when Aisha denied that denial, they submitted to her, which indicates she preserved what they forgot, and that the matter settled on permissibility. Indicating this is the prayer over Abu Bakr and Umar in the mosque as preceded. Also, the reason for which they disliked praying over the dead in the mosque is their claim that he is impure, which is false because of what preceded that the believer does not become impure, alive or dead. The strongest evidence they used for dislike is what Abu Dawood recorded from Abu Huraira who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: (Whoever prays over a funeral in the mosque, there is nothing for him). Ibn Majah recorded it with the wording: (...he has nothing). Its chain contains Salih Mawla Al-Taw'amah, and more than one of the Imams spoke against him. Al-Nawawi said: They - meaning the majority - answered it with several answers: First: That it is weak and not valid to use as proof. Ahmad said: This is a weak hadith; Salih Mawla Al-Taw'amah was unique in it, and he is weak. Second: That what is in the famous verified heard copies of (Sunan Abu Dawood) is: (Whoever prays over a funeral in the mosque, there is nothing against him), so they have no argument then. Third: That if the hadith were established and it was established as: (nothing for him), it would be obligatory to interpret (for him/lahu) as meaning: against him (alayhi) to reconcile the two narrations. He said: It has come meaning 'against' like His saying: {If you do evil, then it is against it (laha)} [Al-Isra / 7].",

I say: The most likely view regarding the hadith of Abu Huraira in terms of transmission is the narration of those who said: (he has nothing) or (there is nothing for him), because it is so with all who recorded the hadith whom we came across, except Abu Dawood. He recorded it via the path of Yahya bin Saeed from Ibn Abi Dhi'b: Salih Mawla Al-Taw'amah narrated to me from him with the wording: (there is nothing against him).

My heart is not reassured by any of the answers Al-Nawawi mentioned except the first answer, which is that the hadith is weak so there is no proof in it.

And from Uthman bin Abi Al-Aas Al-Thaqafi: That the delegation of Thaqif came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, so he lodged them in the mosque so it would be softer for their hearts. They stipulated to the Prophet, peace be upon him, that they not be gathered (for war/labor), nor pay tithes, nor bow in prayer, and that no one other than them be appointed over them. He said: (You will not be gathered, nor pay tithes, nor bow, and no one other than you will be appointed over you. And there is no good in a religion that has no bowing).

The hadith was recorded by Ibn Abi Shaybah and Al-Tabarani also from the narration of Al-Hasan from Uthman as in (Takhrij Al-Kashshaf).

They said: O Messenger of Allah, [we are] an unclean people. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (There is nothing of the uncleanness of people upon the earth; rather, the uncleanness of people is upon themselves). Yunus narrated from Al-Zuhri bin Al-Musayyib: That Abu Sufyan used to enter the Mosque of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was a disbeliever, except that this is not lawful in the Sacred Mosque due to the statement of Allah: {so let them not approach the Sacred Mosque} [At-Tawbah / 28]. Abu Bakr said: As for the delegation of Thaqif, they came after the conquest of Mecca to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and the verse was revealed in the year in which Abu Bakr performed Hajj, which is the ninth year. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, lodged them in the mosque and informed that their being unclean does not prevent their entry into the mosque. In that, there is evidence that the impurity of disbelief does not prevent the disbeliever from entering the mosque. As for Abu Sufyan, he came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, to renew the truce, and that was before the Conquest, and Abu Sufyan was a polytheist at that time. Even if the verse's revelation was after that, it only implied the prohibition of approaching the Sacred Mosque and did not imply prohibiting disbelievers from entering other mosques). In summary, there is a view regarding the validity of this addition in the Hadith because it is Mursal according to Al-Bayhaqi, and we have not found it connected except in what Abu Bakr Al-Jassas cited in a suspended manner. I say this, even if Siddiq Hasan Khan used it as evidence in (Ar-Rawdah An-Nadiyyah)",

This is with the knowledge that the origin of the Hadith, regarding its validity, is subject to scrutiny due to what preceded regarding its defect. And Allah knows best. (And all mosques are equal in that regard except the Sacred Mosque, for it is not permissible to enable them to approach it due to the saying of the Exalted: {O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean, so let them not approach the Sacred Mosque after this, their [final] year} [At-Tawbah / 28]). The verse is evidence for the prohibition of the entry of disbelievers and polytheists into the Sacred Mosque. This wording indicates the entire Haram (Sanctuary), which is the school of Ata bin Abi Rabah, who said: (The entire Haram is a Qiblah and a Mosque, so they should be prevented from entering the Haram due to the saying of the Exalted: {Glory be to Him who took His Servant by night from the Sacred Mosque} while he was only taken up from the house of Umm Hani). Al-Qurtubi mentioned it and then said: (Therefore, it is forbidden to enable a polytheist to enter the Haram entirely. If a messenger comes from them, the Imam goes out to the Hill (non-sanctuary area) to hear what he says). I say: Specifying the Sacred Mosque by mention in the noble verse indicates that other mosques do not share its ruling, so the entry of polytheists into them is permissible. This is supported by the preceding Hadiths. Ibn Hazm went to this view in (Al-Muhalla), saying: (And the entry of polytheists into all mosques is permissible except the Haram of Mecca entirely, the Mosque and other than it; it is not lawful at all for a disbeliever to enter it. This is the saying of Al-Shafi'i and Abu Sulayman. Abu Hanifa said: There is no harm if a Jew or a Christian enters it, but other religions are prevented from it",

Ibn Hazm said: So Allah specified the Sacred Mosque; thus, it is not permissible to extend it to others without a text). I say: The followers of Malik argued for his school using the reasoning mentioned in the verse, so they applied it to all mosques. Al-Qurtubi said: (Al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, said: The verse is general regarding all polytheists but specific to the Sacred Mosque, and they are not prevented from entering others; so he permitted the entry of Jews and Christians into other mosques). Ibn Al-Arabi said: (This is rigidity from him upon the apparent meaning because the saying of the Mighty and Majestic: {Indeed the polytheists are unclean} [At-Tawbah / 28] is an alert to the cause being polytheism and impurity). Siddiq Khan said in (Nayl Al-Maram): (This is answered by the fact that this analogy is rejected by his, peace and blessings be upon him, tying of Thumamah bin Uthal in his mosque and lodging the delegation of Thaqif in it). I say: As for tying Thumamah, Ibn Al-Arabi himself answered it by saying it was before the revelation of the verse. Ibn Al-Arabi himself answered similarly regarding Abu Sufyan entering the mosque as preceded. As for the lodging of the delegation of Thaqif in it, if its chain were authentic, it would be a proof against them with no answer for it, because it was after the revelation of the verse as previously mentioned from Abu Bakr Al-Jassas.

This agrees with what Al-Jassas recounted in (Al-Ahkam) and Al-Ayni in (Al-Umdah) from Abu Hanifa. Al-Ayni said: (And he argued with what Ahmad narrated in his (Musnad) with a good chain from Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (No polytheist shall enter this mosque of ours after this year of ours, except for the people of the covenant and their servants).) Others besides these attributed to Abu Hanifa the opinion of the permissibility of the polytheist entering as well. In (Fath Al-Bari): (Regarding the entry of the polytheist into the mosque, there are schools of thought. From the Hanafis is permissibility absolutely. From the Malikis and Al-Muzani is prohibition absolutely. From the Shafi'is is the detailing between the Sacred Mosque and others due to the verse. And it is said: Permission is given to the Scriptuary (Kitabi) specifically. The Hadith of the chapter refutes this, for Thumamah was not from the People of the Book). This transmission is supported by what is in (Fayd Al-Bari): (As for the Hanafis, they said: The polytheist is not physically impure, and he may enter the Sacred Mosque and others, as in (Al-Jami' As-Saghir), so the verse was problematic for them. I say: In (As-Siyar Al-Kabir), it states that he does not enter the Sacred Mosque according to us as well, as is the apparent meaning of the text. It was chosen in (Ad-Durr Al-Mukhtar) because it is the last of the writings of Muhammad, may Allah be pleased with him. Then Sheikh Al-Kashmiri, the author of (Al-Fayd), explicitly stated his choice of it and reasoned for that by his saying in what preceded of the book:",

It has two defects: First: The 'an'an (using the word \"from\") of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, and he is a Mudallis (obfuscator in narration) as in (At-Taqrib) and others. The other: The weakness of Sharik - who is the Judge - regarding his memory. It has come with a strong chain halted (Mauquf) at Jabir, which is the correct view. Abu Bakr Al-Jassas said after mentioning it from this mode in a suspended manner: (Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ishaq Al-Marwazi told us, he said: Al-Hasan bin Abi Ar-Rabi' Al-Jurjani told us, he said: Abdur-Razzaq informed us: Ibn Jurayj informed us: Abu Az-Zubayr informed me that he heard Jabir bin Abdullah say regarding the saying of the Exalted: {Indeed the polytheists are unclean, so let them not approach the Sacred Mosque}: Except if he is a slave or one of the people of the Dhimma).

Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ishaq is Abu Al-Qasim, known as Hamid Ra'sihi; Al-Khatib wrote his biography in his (Tarikh) and said: (Al-Barqani said: I asked Al-Abhari about him, and he said: Trustworthy, died in the year three hundred and twenty-nine).

I say: This reconciliation is good, but it is only resorted to if the one who raised it is an authority in his narration and memory, and you have known that there are two defects in the raised (Marfu') narration, unlike this halted (Mauquf) one, so it was the preferred one. (Anecdote): Ibn Al-Arabi said: (I used to see a wonder in Damascus: Its grand mosque had two gates: an eastern gate, which is the Gate of Jayrun, and a western gate.

The Muslim would say to him: I gave him permission. So the custodian would leave him). This, and Ibn Hazm has a valuable research in this station in verifying that the word (Mushrikin) [polytheists] in the previous verse includes Jews and Christians, contrary to Abu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy on him. It must be quoted due to the benefits within it and the refutation of some doubts regarding certain verses, which might not be found in another book. He, may Allah have mercy on him, said: (As for the statement of Abu Hanifa, he said: Allah the Exalted has differentiated between the polytheists and the rest of the disbelievers, saying the Exalted: {Those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists were not to be parted [from their disbelief]} [Al-Bayyinah / 1]. And the Exalted said: {Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who associated others with Allah - indeed, Allah will judge between them} [Al-Hajj / 17]. He said: The Mushrik (polytheist) is the one who sets up a partner for Allah, not the one who does not set up a partner for Him. Ibn Hazm said: He has no argument other than what we mentioned. As for his attachment to the two verses, there is no argument for him in them because Allah the Exalted said: {In both of them are fruit and date palms and pomegranates} [Ar-Rahman / 68], and the pomegranate is a fruit. And the Exalted said: {Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael} [Al-Baqarah / 98], and they are among the angels. And the Exalted said: {And [mention, O Muhammad], when We took from the prophets their covenant and from you and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus} [Al-Ahzab / 7], and these are among the prophets",

So we say, and with Allah is success: The first contradictor of the text of the two verses is Abu Hanifa, because the Magians are polytheists according to him, yet Allah the Exalted differentiated in mention between the Magians and the polytheists, so his attachment to Allah's conjoining of one group to the other is invalidated. Then we found that Allah the Exalted has said: {Indeed, Allah does not forgive that you associate partners with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills} [An-Nisa / 48]. If there were a disbelief here that is not polytheism (Shirk), it would be forgiven for whom Allah the Exalted wills, contrary to Shirk, and no Muslim says this. Then Ibn Hazm narrated via the path of Muslim with his chain to Ibn Mas'ud who said: A man said: O Messenger of Allah, which sin is greatest with Allah? He said: That you call upon a rival for Allah while He created you. He said: Then which? He said: That you kill your child for fear that he eats with you. And from his path also with his chain from Abu Bakrah who said: We were with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, so he said: (Shall I not inform you of the greatest of major sins?

Ali bin Hazm said: If there were a disbelief here that is not polytheism, that disbelief would be outside of the major sins, and disobedience to parents and false testimony would be greater than it; and no Muslim says this. So it is correct that every disbelief is polytheism and every polytheism is disbelief, and they are two Sharia names which Allah the Exalted applied to one meaning. As for his argument that the polytheist is only the one who sets up a partner for Allah, it is demolished against him from two aspects: One of them: The Christians set up a partner for Allah who creates like His creation, yet he says: They are not polytheists. This is a clear contradiction. The second: The Brahmins and those who say the world is eternal and that it has one eternal Creator, and those who say regarding the prophethood of Ali bin Abi Talib and Al-Mughirah and Bazigh—all of them do not set up a partner for Allah the Exalted, yet they are polytheists according to Abu Hanifa. This is a clear contradiction. And a third aspect: Which is that if the polytheist were not such unless the name of 'association' (Tashrik) in the language applied to him—which is whoever sets up a partner for Allah the Exalted only—it would be obligatory that disbelief not be such unless from one who disbelieved in Allah the Exalted and denied Him entirely, not from one who acknowledged Him and did not deny Him. This would entail that there are no disbelievers except the Dahriyyah (materialists/atheists) only, and that the Jews, Christians, Magians, and Brahmins are not disbelievers because they are all acknowledgers of Allah the Exalted; and neither he nor any Muslim says this",

    "text": "on the face of the earth. Or it would be obligatory that everyone who covered something be a Kafir (disbeliever), for Kufr in the language is: covering. Since all of this is false, it is correct that they are two names which Allah the Exalted transferred from their subject in the language to apply to everyone who denies anything from the religion of Islam, being in his denial obstinate towards the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, after the warning reached him. And with Allah the Exalted is success). I say: The obligation mentioned in the third aspect did not appear correct to me, because he who says that Shirk is other than Kufr makes it more specific than it, and it is known that the specific enters into the general, like the entry of Christians and Jews among the polytheists according to Ibn Hazm in the previous verse, and according to others from the predecessors among the Companions and the Successors in the saying of the Exalted: {And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe, and a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist woman, even though she might please you. And do not marry polytheistic men [to your women] until they believe} [Al-Baqarah / 221] the verse. So everyone who commits Shirk has committed Kufr by agreement, so the obligation is not valid. However, Ibn Hazm says the reverse as well, which is that everyone who disbelieves by any of the nullifiers has committed Shirk, and the evidences he cited support that. I do not know what contradicts that from the Book and the Sunnah. Rather, the apparent meaning of the saying of the Exalted in Surah Al-Kahf: {And present to them an example of two men: We granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines, and We bordered them with palm trees, and We placed between them crops} [Al-Kahf / 32] to the saying of the Exalted: {And he said to his companion while he conversed with him, \"I am greater than you in wealth and mightier in numbers.\" And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself. He said, \"I do not think that this will perish ever. And I do not think the Hour will occur. And even if I should be brought back to my Lord, I will surely find better than this as a return.\" His companion said to him while he conversed with him, \"Have you disbelieved in He who created you from dust and then from a sperm-drop and then proportioned you [as] a man?

So He, Glory be to Him, applied to this man who denied the Resurrection and the Gathering that he associated partners with Him, the Exalted. This is apparent from the context of the verses, for the Exalted did not recount about him any disbelief other than what was mentioned, then He recounted his regret when he saw what befell his fruits and his two gardens by his saying: {Oh, I wish I had not associated with my Lord anyone}. So He applied Shirk to the mentioned disbelief. Perhaps the reason is that his denial of the Resurrection is a resort to the idea that Allah the Exalted is not capable of it, which is incapacitating the Lord, Glory be to Him and Exalted, and whoever incapacitates Him, Glory be to Him and Exalted, has likened Him to His creation; so it is polytheism). Al-Qurtubi mentioned it similarly. And Allah knows best. (8 - Bringing a Riding Animal in for a Need: Because he, upon him be peace and blessings, entered the Sacred Mosque circling on his she-camel, as Jabir bin Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: (The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, circled in the Farewell Pilgrimage on his mount at the House and between As-Safa and Al-Marwah so that the people could see him and so he could look over [them] and they could ask him, [for] the people crowded him) the Hadith. Muslim, Abu Dawood, An-Nasa'i, and Ahmad extracted it from the path of Ibn Jurayj: Abu Az-Zubayr informed me that he heard Jabir bin Abdullah.

In the chapter is a report from Umm Salamah regarding her circling while riding, and they will come in (The Hajj) if Allah the Exalted wills. Al-Bukhari titled the Hadith of Umm Salamah in (The Book of Prayer) as: (Chapter: Bringing the Camel into the Mosque for a Cause), meaning: A need. Ibn Battal said: (In this Hadith is the permissibility of the entry of animals whose meat is eaten into the mosque if that is needed, because their urine does not make it impure, unlike other animals. This was critiqued [by saying] that there is no indication in the Hadith of impermissibility when there is a need; rather, that revolves around pollution and the lack thereof, so where pollution is feared, entry is prevented). Al-Ayni objected to him in his (Sharh) saying: (There is a consideration in it, because his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (Circle while you are riding (meaning Umm Salamah) does not indicate that permissibility and the lack thereof revolve around pollution; rather, its apparent meaning indicates permissibility absolutely in case of necessity.

I say: Al-Iraqi said in (Sharh At-Taqrib): (Ibn Battal narrated its permissibility from most of the people of knowledge, and he narrated from Malik and Sahnun its dislike as a purification for the mosque). I say: The Hadith is a proof against them. Yes, it must not be accompanied by what violates [decorum] legally, as is the reality today in most mosques which piped water (Fayjah) has been drawn to, due to what is heard of the loud sound from the rush of water from the (faucets) and its collision with the tiles, which causes noise and disturbance to those praying in it. Therefore, we see that it is necessary to place the ablution facility in a confined place beside the mosques, not inside them, as is the matter in the Mosque of (Isa Pasha) facing Souq Al-Hamidiyah and others.

Al-Mundhiri attributed it in its entirety to Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah in his (Sahih), and Al-Hakim, and said: (Authentic on their condition). An-Nawawi said in (Sharh Muslim): (It was said the intended meaning of Sakina (tranquility) here is mercy, which is what Qadi Iyad chose, but it is weak due to the conjunction of mercy upon it. It was said: Reassurance and dignity, which is better. In this is evidence for the merit of gathering to recite the Qur'an in the mosque, which is our school and the school of the majority. Malik said: It is disliked. And some of his companions interpreted it). I say: Perhaps the interpretation referred to is that what Malik disliked of the gathering was what contradicted his guidance, upon him be peace and blessings, therein, like gathering for recitation with one voice (unison), for it is an innovation that was not transmitted from him, upon him be peace and blessings, nor from any of the Companions. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to sometimes command whoever recited the Qur'an so he could hear his recitation, just as Ibn Mas'ud recited to him, and he said: (I love to hear it from other than myself). Umar used to command whoever recited to him and his companions while they listened; so sometimes he commanded Abu Musa and sometimes he commanded Uqbah bin Amir. Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab narrated it in (Jami' Al-Ulum wal-Hikam) then said: (Harb mentioned that he saw the people of Damascus, the people of Homs, the people of Mecca, and the people of Basra gathering for the Qur'an after the Dawn Prayer.

As for the Sunnah, it is the hadith: (Keep your mosques free of your children and your insane ones). It was critiqued that the hadith is weak, and there is not in it nor in the Verse a declaration of what he claimed, nor is the date known so that abrogation is established. Some Malikis narrated from Malik that their playing was outside the mosque and Aisha was in the mosque. This is not proven from Malik, for it contradicts what is explicitly stated in the paths of this hadith, and in some of them is that Umar disapproved of their playing in the mosque, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: (Leave them). Playing with spears is not mere play; rather, it contains training of the brave for the positions of wars and preparation for the enemy. Al-Muhallab said: The mosque is established for the command of the community of Muslims, so whatever actions combine the benefit of the religion and its people are permissible in it). This contains a restriction of the play permissible in the mosque to what contains a public interest. This is the truth, if Allah the Exalted wills. Al-San'ani critiqued that in (Subul al-Salam) with the wording that preceded: (Let the Jews know that in our religion is room...) etc., saying: (And this refutes the statement of Al-Tabari that the Abyssinians are forgiven what is not forgiven for others, so it is affirmed where it was reported, and it refutes the statement of those who said: That playing with spears is not mere play, but contains training for the brave for the positions of wars and preparation for the enemy, for in that is the interest that gathers the general Muslims and is needed in establishing the religion, so its performance in the mosque was permitted).",

I say: And the statement of Al-Karabisi: (And the entry of the polytheist into the mosque is disliked) is something for which there is no evidence for its absolute application; rather, the Sunnah indicates the permissibility of bringing them into the mosques except the Sacred Mosque, as previously explained in paragraph seven. This is supported by the reports with which he himself corrected this saying, so take note. And in (Al-Umdah) is a summary: (Al-Bukhari only mentioned this hadith abridged to establish the permissibility of judging in the mosque, which is held by the general scholars. It is reported from Al-Shafi'i that it is disliked in the mosque if he prepares it for that, excluding if a judgment happens to come to him in it.

Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Fath): (And it is apparent that his action, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was to clarify permissibility, and that was at a time of rest, not when people were gathered, due to what is known of his custom of sitting among them with complete dignity, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. Al-Khattabi said: In it is the permissibility of leaning in the mosque and lying down, and types of resting. Al-Dawudi said: In it is that the reward narrated for the one staying in the mosque is not specific to the sitter, but is obtained for the one lying on his back as well). Know that it has been proven in (Sahih Muslim) and others from the hadith of Jabir: That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that a man lift one of his legs over the other while he is lying on his back. It is clear that this does not contradict what we mentioned of absolute lying on the back; rather, in its apparent meaning, it contradicts lying on the back in the form mentioned in the two hadiths. Scholars have reconciled them by interpreting this prohibition as applying when it is feared that the private part [awrah] will be exposed, and permissibility when that is secured. And Allah knows best. As for the hadith which Al-Tabarani extracted from the hadith of Qatadah ibn al-Nu'man: That the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: (When Allah finished His creation, He lay on His back and placed His leg over the other and said: It is not befitting for anyone of My creation to do this),",

As for Ahmad ibn Rushdin, he is weak, and the two [others] I did not know, and the rest of its men are the men of the Sahih).

Allah the Exalted refuted them in more than one Verse, saying, Exalted is He: {And We did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days, and there touched Us no weariness} [Qaf / 38]. It is most likely that the origin of the hadith is from the Israeliyat [stories of the Children of Israel] that leaked to the Muslims from some of the People of the Book, then some narrators imagined in it, so they raised it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as appeared in (Musnad Ahmad), and it is an error as Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir explained in (The Tafsir) and others.

In these two hadiths, there is evidence for the permissibility of hanging the 'Qinu' — with a Kasrah on the Qaf and a Sukun on the Nun — which is the 'Adhq' (cluster) and the 'Arjun' (date bunch) containing dates. Similar to it in ruling is the grape cluster and the like. The speech of Al-Hafiz regarding this has preceded in the past chapter. And in (Al-Umdah): (Ibn Al-Qasim said: Malik was asked about hanging fruit clusters in the mosque and what resembles that, and he said: There is no harm in it. He was asked about the water that is provided for drinking in the mosque, 'Do you see it permissible to drink from it?' He said: 'Yes, it was only placed for thirst, and it was not intended only for the destitute, so I do not see that one should refrain from drinking it, and this has ceased to be the practice of the people.') (32 - Asking by the needy and giving charity to him, due to the hadith: 'Is there anyone among you who fed a poor person today?' Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'I entered the mosque and there was a beggar asking, and I found a piece of bread with Abdul Rahman, so I took it [from him] and gave it to him'). The Hadith was narrated by Abu Dawood — and the addition is his — and Al-Hakim via Mubarak bin Fadalah from Thabit Al-Bunani from Abdul Rahman bin Abi Layla from Abdul Rahman bin Abi Bakr in a Marfu' form. Al-Hakim said: 'Sahih according to the condition of Muslim.' Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, but they were mistaken, for this Mubarak is not one of Muslim's narrators at all, and he is truthful (Saduq) but he is...",

Al-Mundhiri said in his (Mukhtasar): 'Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar said: We do not know of this Hadith being narrated from Abdul Rahman bin Abi Bakr except with this chain, and he mentioned that it was narrated as Mursal.' I say: This Mursal report strengthens this connected (Mawsul) one. Then he said: 'Muslim narrated it in his (Sahih) and Al-Nasa'i in his (Sunan) from the hadith of Abu Hazim Salman Al-Ashja'i from Abu Hurayrah with a similar meaning, but more complete.' I say: The hadith is in (Sahih Muslim) as Al-Mundhiri mentioned, but it does not mention that the charity was in the mosque; rather, it is general. As for Al-Nasa'i, I did not find it in his (Sunan Al-Sughra), nor did Al-Nabulusi attribute it to him in (Al-Dhakha'ir), so it appears it is in his (Sunan Al-Kubra). Al-Suyuti said in the treatise (Badhl Al-Asjad li Su'al Al-Masjid) from his (Al-Hawi), after quoting Al-Mundhiri's words: 'I say: It was narrated: And Al-Bukhari narrated it in (Ahkam Al-Masajid) by Al-Zarkashi.' This is how it is in the original, and there is clear confusion in the phrasing. In any case, the hadith is not in Al-Bukhari. And Allah knows best. In the chapter, from Ibn Abbas, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, went out to the mosque while the people were praying, between bowing, prostrating, standing, and sitting. Suddenly there was a poor man asking, so the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, entered and said: 'Did anyone give you anything?'",

Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said 'Allahu Akbar' at that, while saying: ({And whoever is an ally of Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed - indeed, the party of Allah - they will be the predominant.} [Al-Ma'idah / 56]). In some books, it states that he recited the verse preceding this one, which is: ({Your ally is none but Allah and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed, those who establish prayer and give zakah, and they bow [in worship]}). However, it is a weak hadith. Ibn Mardawayh narrated it with this wording in his (Tafsir) via Muhammad bin Al-Sa'ib Al-Kalbi from Abu Salih from him. Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir said: 'This chain is not to be rejoiced over; Al-Kalbi is abandoned (Matruk). Then Ibn Mardawayh narrated it from the hadith of Ali bin Abi Talib himself, Ammar bin Yasir, and Abu Rafi', and none of it is authentic at all due to the weakness of their chains and the anonymity of their narrators.' As for Al-Suyuti, he said in the aforementioned treatise: 'These are paths for the revelation of this noble verse regarding giving charity to a beggar in the mosque, confirming one another.' I do not think this is correct, because the fact that multiple paths strengthen a hadith is not absolute as mentioned in the books of Terminology (Mustalah); rather, that is restricted to when there is...",

I say this even though I have not stood upon their narrators except for the first path, which contains Al-Kalbi, who is abandoned, so his hadith is discarded and cannot be used for support. And Allah knows best. Furthermore, if it were correct to say about these paths what Al-Suyuti went for, Ibn Kathir himself would have mentioned it, especially since he is more knowledgeable about Hadith and its defects than Al-Suyuti, as is not hidden. In summary, the reliance in this chapter is on the hadith of Abdul Rahman bin Abi Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him. It contains evidence for what we mentioned regarding the permissibility of asking and giving charity in the mosque. Abu Dawood titled a chapter for it with some of that, saying: (Chapter: Asking in the Mosques). Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, was asked about this issue, and he answered, may Allah have mercy on him, with the text: 'The principle of begging is forbidden inside the mosque and outside the mosque except for necessity. If there is a necessity and he asks in the mosque without harming anyone by stepping over people's necks, nor by anything other than stepping over, and he does not lie in what he narrates and mentions of his condition, and he does not raise his voice loudly to harm people—such as asking the Khatib while the Khatib is delivering the sermon, or while they are listening to knowledge that he distracts them from, and similar to that—then it is permissible, and Allah knows best.'

This is what is transmitted and what the hadiths indicated.') Then he quoted Al-Nawawi as saying: 'There is no harm in giving to the beggar in the mosque due to this hadith.' Al-Suyuti said: 'The hadith he cited contains evidence for both matters together: that charity to him is not Makruh, and that asking in the mosque is not prohibited, because he, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, became aware of that through the information from Al-Siddiq and did not deny it. If it were Haram, he would not have affirmed it, but would have prevented the beggar from returning to ask in the mosque. By this, it is known that the prohibition of asking in the mosque—if proven—is interpreted as dislike and discouragement, and this diverts it from prohibition.' He said: 'As for what occurred in (Al-Madkhil) by Ibn Al-Hajj from the hadith: (Whoever asks in the mosques, deprive him), it has no basis. We only said it is Makruh based on the hadith forbidding announcing lost property in the mosque and his saying: (Indeed, the mosques were not built for this).' Also indicating the permissibility of giving charity in the mosque is the upcoming hadith, which Al-Suyuti missed and did not cite in his treatise, nor did he even allude to it, which is: 'A man entered the mosque [in a shabby condition], so the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered that they throw clothes for him. So they threw, and he ordered that two garments be given to him from them. Then he urged charity, so the man came and threw one of the two garments, so he shouted at him (and in a wording: he scolded him) and said: (Take your garment).'",

The face of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, changed when he saw the poverty they were in.

As for taking it as a regular place for sleeping and napping, they are forbidden from that. As for speech that Allah and His Messenger love in the mosque, it is good.

In it is a refutation of Abu Umar bin Abdul Barr where he chose that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, did not face Bayt Al-Maqdis while he was in Makkah, but rather faced it when he migrated to Madinah. He used as evidence the hadith of Al-Bara' coming after this, but there is no proof in it, because even if he did not explicitly deny facing it before that—even if he did explicitly deny it—it would not be a proof. Rather, it would be obligatory to take the hadith of Ibn Abbas because of the addition and knowledge it contains. The addition of a trustworthy narrator is accepted, and one who knows is a proof over one who does not know, and the affirmer takes precedence over the negator. All these are agreed-upon rules and have been stated in many branches of knowledge as is not hidden to the researcher.

I say: Al-Hafiz remained silent regarding this hadith of Ibn Abbas, and perhaps that is due to the clarity of its defect, for this Ali bin Abi Talhah is truthful (Saduq) but he makes mistakes, and he narrated from Ibn Abbas in a Mursal form and did not see him, as Al-Hafiz himself said in (Al-Taqrib). So the hadith with this context is weak due to its interruption.",

And indeed, it was difficult except for those whom Allah guided. And Allah would not let your faith be lost. Indeed, Allah is Ever Gracious and Merciful to the people} [Al-Baqarah: 143].

This is a portion of the well-known hadith of ‘The One Who Prayed Incorrectly’, and this narration is from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that a man entered the mosque and prayed while the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was sitting in a corner of the mosque. The man came and greeted him, so the Prophet said to him (in one narration he added: ‘And peace be upon you’): (Go back and pray, for you have not prayed). So the man returned and prayed, then came back and greeted him. The Prophet said: (And peace [be upon you]. Go back and pray, for you have not prayed). On the third time the man said: Teach me. The Prophet said: (When you stand for prayer, perform your ablution thoroughly, then face the Qiblah and say the Takbir. Then recite whatever is easy for you from the Qur’an. Then bow until you are at ease in your bowing. Then rise until you stand upright. Then prostrate until you are at ease in your prostration. Then rise until you sit straight and are at ease. Then prostrate until you are at ease in your prostration. Then rise until you stand straight. Do this throughout your entire prayer).",

And Allah is the Granter of success. ([He said at its end: If you do this, your prayer is complete, and whatever you decrease from this, you have only decreased from your prayer]). This addition was narrated uniquely by Abu Dawood in a narration of his from the Hadith of Abu Hurairah, and its chain is authentic on the condition of Al-Bukhari. It is established in the Hadith of Rifa'ah bin Rafi'. This Hadith - like the verse - indicates the obligation of facing the Qiblah in prayer.

However, here there is something that prevents conditionality, which is the report of the expedition that At-Tirmidhi, Ahmad, and At-Tabarani extracted from the Hadith of Amir bin Rabi'ah with the wording: We were with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, on a dark night, and we did not know where the Qiblah was. So every man among us prayed in his own direction. When we reached morning, we mentioned that to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, so it was revealed: {So wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah} [Al-Baqarah / 115]. If facing [the Qiblah] were a condition, repetition would have been obligatory within the time and after it, because the absence of a condition effects non-existence [of the act's validity], even though the Hadawiyyah agree with us on the lack of obligation to repeat after the time has passed, which contradicts his saying: that facing is a condition. This Hadith, even if there is some criticism regarding it among the Hadith scholars, has witnesses that strengthen it). I say: Then he mentioned them, and they will come. Then he said: (In the Hadith of Mu'adh, there is an explicit statement that this was after finishing the prayer before the time had elapsed, which is more explicit in indicating conditionality.

If this consensus is correct, it is obligatory to resort to it, and it would not be contrary to the Hadith which Ash-Shawkani used as proof for the lack of conditionality. That is because it was reported in a context other than the point of dispute - I mean: regarding the unintentional [omission] - so it indicates the validity of his prayer. The mentioned consensus indicates its invalidity for the intentional one, so there is no disagreement and no contradiction. Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, stated decisively in his (Ikhtiyarat) (pp. 27-28) in more than one issue regarding the invalidity of the prayer of one who does not face the Kaaba, and he inevitably means by it the intentional one; as for other than him, it is a place of consideration =",

It is a strong critique as you see. So nothing remains except the first meaning and the probability stated by An-Nawawi, which is what is apparent to us from the Hadith. And Allah knows best. More than one scholar has reported the agreement on the obligation of facing the eye (exact spot) of the Kaaba for the viewer. In (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi): (There is no disagreement among the scholars that the Kaaba is a Qiblah in every horizon, and they agreed that whoever witnesses it and sees it, facing it is obligatory upon him; and that if he abandons facing it while viewing it and knowing its direction, he has no prayer, and he must repeat everything he prayed. Abu Umar mentioned it). Ibn Hazm said: (There is no disagreement among anyone of the Ummah that if a person were in Mecca such that he is able to face the Kaaba in his prayer, but he turns his face intentionally away from it to parts of the Sacred Mosque from its outside or inside, then his prayer is invalid (1), and if he deems that lawful, he is a disbeliever.
