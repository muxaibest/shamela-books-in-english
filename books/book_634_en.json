    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. May Allah bless our Master Muhammad and grant him peace. Praise be to Allah who taught us what we did not know, preferred us over many of His creation and advanced us, and made us among those who are emulated and followed. Blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad and his family and peace.\n\nAbu Muhammad Abdullah bin Muhammad bin as-Sid al-Batalyawsi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: When I finished discussing the correction of errors occurring in the book 'Al-Jumal', I wanted to follow that speech with the parsing (I'rab) of its poetic verses and their meanings, and what I recall of the names of their authors. My purpose is to connect each verse with what relates to it so it becomes clearer regarding the purpose of its speaker and his doctrine. I was not prevented from discussing their parsing and meanings by the speech of others before me regarding them, for perhaps the speech of another has merit over what is besides it, and an increase of benefit for the one who reviews and narrates it. I ask Allah for help in what I reveal; He is the Possessor of Bounty and its Giver; there is no Lord but Him, and no deity except Him.\n\nAbu al-Qasim, may Allah have mercy on him, recited in the Chapter of the Adjective (Na't):\n'May my people not perish/be distant, who are ... the poison of enemies and the bane of the slaughter-camels'\n'Those descending at every battlefield ... And the pure ones in the tying of waist-wrappers'\n\nThis poetry is by Khirniq bint Haffan al-Qaisamiyyah. She is the sister of Tarafa bin al-Abd al-Maliki through his mother. It is from a poem in which she mourned her husband, Bishr bin Amr bin Marthad, and those killed with him from his sons and his people. He had raided Banu Asad bin Khuzaimah, he and Amr bin Abdullah bin al-Ashall. They were supporting each other: Bishr leading Banu Malik and Banu Attab bin Rabi'ah, and Amr leading Banu Ruhm. The meaning of 'Tasanud' (mutual support) is that each man goes out on his own authority, without a single commander uniting them. They raided Banu Asad, but Banu Asad beat them to a mountain pass called Qilab. Bishr bin Amr and his sons were killed, and Amr bin Abdullah bin al-Ashall fled. That day was named: The Day of Qilab.\n\nKhirniq: Is one of the names transferred from species to proper nouns; because 'Khirniq' in the language is the young of a rabbit, used for both male and female. Al-Khirniq is also: A water cistern, similar to a reservoir. As for Haffan: It is an improvised name, not transferred, derived from 'Hafif', which is speed and lightness. It is said: Haffan with a fatha or kasra on the Ha.\n\nThe meaning of 'La yab'adan': May they not perish. It is a supplication that came in the form of a prohibition, though it is not a prohibition, just as a supplication may come in the form of a command, though it is not a command, as when you say: 'O Allah, forgive Zayd.' The parsing of the verb is nullified due to the entry of the light Nun (Nu of emphasis) into it, because it renders the future tense built on sukoon (fixed), preventing grammatical operators from affecting it. It flows with a fatha for the singular male, a kasra for the singular female, and a damma for the group of males. Its movement is to prevent the meeting of two still letters according to the school of Sibawayh.\n\nIt is said: 'Ba'uda ar-rajulu yab'udu' (The man became distant), on the pattern of 'Alima ya'lamu', meaning when he perished. Allah the Almighty said: 'Away with Midian as Thamud was taken away.' But if you mean the distance that is the opposite of nearness, you say: 'Ba'uda yab'udu', on the pattern of 'Zarufa yazrufu'. The source (Masdar) meant for destruction is 'Ba'dan' with fatha on Ba and Ayn. The source meant for the opposite of nearness is 'Bu'dan', on the pattern of its opposite, which is 'Qurb'. They might use 'Bu'd' (distance) for destruction due to the overlap of their meanings.\n\nIf a questioner asks: How did she pray for her people not to perish when they had already perished?! The answer is: The Arabs have followed a custom of using this phrase in supplicating for the dead. They have two purposes in this: First: They intend to magnify the death of a great man, as if they do not believe his death. Zuhair bin Abi Sulma clarified this meaning saying:\n'They say: Hisn [is dead], then their souls refuse ... And how [can it be] Hisn, when the mountains are leaning!'\n'And the graves have not cast out the dead, nor have ... the stars of the sky ceased, and the surface [of earth] is intact!'\nHe meant that they say: Hisn died, then they find it too great to articulate, saying: How is it possible he died when the mountains have not been leveled, the stars have not fallen, the graves have not expelled their dead, and the body of the world is intact with no calamity occurring in it?! This is one purpose.\nThe second purpose: They intend to pray that his memory remains and does not fade; because the survival of a person's memory after his death is like his life. Do you not see the poet's saying:\n'So praise us - may you have no father [an expression of intensity] ... for our actions, for indeed praise is eternity'\nAnother, At-Tamimi, said mourning Yazid bin Yazid ash-Shaybani:\n'If the nights have finished him, then soon ... indeed he has a memory that will finish the nights!'\nAbu at-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi spoke on this meaning and excelled greatly:",

    "text": "'A youth's mention is his second life, and his need ... is what he missed, and the surplus of life is busywork'\nMalik bin ar-Rayb clarified the impossibility within this meaning when he said:\n'They say: Do not be distant (don't die), while they are burying me ... And where is the place of distance if not my place [the grave]?'\n\nHer saying: 'Poison of enemies and bane of the slaughter-camels': She meant that in their lives they were poison to their enemies because they destroyed them, and a bane (disaster) to their camels because they slaughtered them for their guests. 'Juzur' is the plural of 'Jazour', which is the camel intended for slaughter. It is said: 'Summ' and 'Samm' with damma and fatha on the Seen. At-Tusi claimed it is said 'Simm' with a kasra.\n\nIf it is said: How did she say 'Those who are' (Alladhina hum), which is appropriate for those who exist, while she should have said as the other said:\n'They were a burning fire against the enemies ... And a sanctuary of the sanctuaries for their people?'\nThe answer to this is from two aspects: First: Arabs may hide 'kana' (was/were) relying on the listener's understanding if the wording implies it, like the Almighty's saying: 'And they followed what the devils recite over the kingdom of Solomon,' Al-Kisa'i said: He meant what they 'were' reciting. Ar-Ra'i said:\n'The times of my people and the group is like that which ... prevented the saddle from leaning at all'\nHe meant: 'Were' the times of my people.\nThe second aspect: When she prayed for the survival of their memory after their death, they became like existing people, and were described by what they used to do. It is also possible she prayed with 'La yab'adan' for those remaining of her people, meaning: May Allah not remove those remaining of my people as He removed those who passed. This is strengthened by her saying after this verse:\n'A people, when they ride, you hear from them ... A clamor of shouting and rebuke'\n'If they drink, they give; and if they leave it ... they advise each other against speaking nonsense'\n'And those mixing their unrelated ones with their purebloods ... And the wealthy among them shelters the poor'\n'This is my praise as long as I remain for them ... So when I perish, my grave will cover me'\n\nThe opinion of those who say she prayed for those who died is strengthened by her saying in this poem:\n'They met their death on the morning of Qilab ... Like the driving of the sacrifice being driven to the idol'\n'Al-Udah' (The enemies): Plural of 'Adin', which is the enemy himself. It cannot be the plural of 'Aduww' (Enemy) because [the form] Fa'ul is not pluralized as Fa'lah. Abu Zayd narrated: 'May Allah not let your 'Adi' (enemy) rejoice', meaning your 'Aduww'.\n\n'An-Nuzul' (Descending) in war is of two types: First: At the start of war, which is dismounting from camels to ride horses. Second: At the end, which is dismounting from horses to fight on foot, if the fighting is in a rough, narrow place where there is no room for horses, or perhaps a man embraces his opponent and they both fall to the ground. This is the descending Muhalhil meant by saying:\n'They could not descend, but we descended ... And the brother of war is he who can descend'\nIt is what Antara meant by saying:\n'Among them is a trustworthy brother who fights dismounted ... with the Mashrafi sword, and a knight who did not dismount!'\n\n'Al-Mu'tarak': The place of fighting. It is also called 'Ma'rak'. It is derived from 'Arakat ar-raha al-habba' (The millstone crushed the grain). They meant: It grinds those in it just as the millstone grinds what is put in it. Thus they named it: Raha (Millstone). Antara said: 'A grinding millstone turned upon the people'. Zuhair clarified this saying:\n'So it grinds you like the grinding of the millstone with its cloth ... And it produces twins yearly, then becomes pregnant and weans'\n\nWhen they describe a man with purity of the 'Izar' (waist-wrapper) and its goodness, it is a sign and metonymy for chastity of the private parts. She means: They do not tie their waist-wrappers over fornicating private parts! Likewise, purity of the 'Dhayl' (hem). If they describe with purity of the 'Kumm' (sleeve) or 'Rudan' (which is the sleeve itself), they mean he does not betray or steal! If they describe him with purity of the 'Jayb' (pocket/chest opening), they mean: His heart does not contain cheating or detestable things! They may use the goodness of the 'Hujzah' (waistband) as a metonymy for chastity, as An-Nabigha said:\n'Thin of sandals, good are their waistbands ... They are greeted with basil on the days of festivals'\n\nThe Ba in her saying: 'Bi-kulli mu'tarak' (In every battlefield) means 'Fi' (In), as one says: Zayd is 'Bi-Basra' (in Basra) and 'Fi Basra'. 'Ma'aqid al-Azr' (tying of waist-wrappers): Is accusative (Mansub) due to resemblance to the direct object. The Kufans allow it to be accusative as Tamyiz (specification), because Tamyiz for them can be indefinite or definite, and separation is allowed in the definite. For the Basrans, it is not allowed unless it is indefinite. 'Al-Laghat' and 'Al-Laght' with sukoon or fatha on the Ghayn: The clamor and mixed voices.",

    "text": "'At-Ta'yih': Calling out. It is said: 'Ayyahtu bi-r-rajul', if you called him. In the Hadith, the Angel of Death was asked: How do you seize souls? He said: 'I call them (u'ayyihu biha) as horses are called, and they come to me.' 'Al-Hujr': Ugly speech, with a damma on the Ha; if opened (Hajr), it means delirium. 'An-Nudar': Pure lineage. 'An-Nahit': Its opposite. 'Al-'Atir': What is slaughtered for idols. 'Al-'Atr': Slaughtering for idols (with fatha on Ayn), and 'Al-'Itr' (with kasra) is the slaughtered animal itself.\n\nHer saying: 'So when I perish, my grave will cover me': A statement with no utility on its surface. The meaning is: If I perish, my excuse is established in stopping the praise for them due to my death. It is placing the cause in place of the effect, which is common in speech.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Substitution (Al-Badal):\n'I was like one with two legs; one healthy leg ... And a leg in which Time shot [an affliction], so it became paralyzed'\nThis verse is by Kuthayyir 'Azza. He is: Kuthayyir bin Abdurrahman bin al-Aswad bin Amir bin Uwaimir al-Khuza'i. His Kunya is Abu Sakhr. He was a foolish Rafidi (Shi'a). When death approached him, he said: 'I am innocent before God of Ibn Arwa (Uthman) ... And of the religion of the Kharijites entirely. And of Umar I am innocent, and of Atiq (Abu Bakr) ... The morning he was called Commander of the Faithful.' Then his soul departed, as if it were a pebble falling into water! Ibn Arwa is Uthman bin Affan, may Allah be pleased with him.\n\nKuthayyir: Diminutive of Kathir (Much/Many). It is of the names transferred from adjectives. 'Kathir' is used in Arabic with two meanings: First: The opposite of few in number. Second: To mean mighty and majestic. It is said: 'Kathurtu bika', meaning: I became mighty through you. 'A man is many (mighty) by his brother' is from this. Al-Abbas bin Mirdas meant this in saying:\n'If I am few among your wicked ones ... Then indeed I am many (mighty) among your good ones'\nHe was attributed to 'Azza due to his intense passion and love for her, and his fame for loving her. He was diminutized because he was contemptible and extremely short. When he entered upon Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, he would say to him: 'Lower your head so the ceiling doesn't hurt you!' Therefore, Al-Hazin mocked him saying:\n'The Lord of flies has attached Kuthayyir ... vipers do not bite him nor snakes'\n'Short of shirt, obscene at his house ... The tick bites his buttocks while he is standing'\n\nAs for comparing himself to one with two legs; one healthy and one paralyzed, the scholars of meaning have two opinions: It is said: He meant she promised and covenanted not to change towards him; so he remained firm on his covenant, but she did not remain firm! It is said: He only wished that his young she-camel would get lost, so he would find a way to stay with her ('Azza). So, his staying with her would be like the healthy leg, and the loss of his camel carrying him and his cessation of travel would be like the paralyzed leg! Both meanings are correct. The first meaning is like An-Najashi saying:\n'I was like one with two legs, one healthy ... And a leg struck by the companion of calamities'\n'As for the one that was healthy, it is Azd Shanu'ah ... And as for the paralyzed one, it is Azd Oman'\nAlso supporting this is Kuthayyir's saying:\n'We walked an ascent of passion ... When we met, I stood firm and she slipped'\n\nAs for those who said it falls under wishful thinking (Tamanni), they said so because before it is:\n'Would that my young camel was fettered at Azza's ... With a weak rope, pulled from it, so it went astray'\n'And her saddle was left among the residing tribe ... And had a seeker other than me, so it wore out'\nSo the estimation according to them is: Would that my camel was fettered at Azza's, and would that I was...\n\nHis saying 'Rama fiha az-zaman' (Time shot into it): A sentence in the place of an adjective for 'Rijlin' (a leg). He meant: Time shot disease and paralysis into it, so he omitted the object. It is narrated: 'Rijlun sahihatun, wa rijlun...' with Raf' (nominative). This is because the estimation is: 'They are a healthy leg and a leg...', so it is the predicate of a hidden subject. Or if you wish, the estimation is: 'One of them is a healthy leg, and the other is a leg...', so the speech is two sentences. In the first estimation, it is one sentence. If you wish, the estimation is: 'Of them is a healthy leg, and of them is a leg...', so each is a subject, and the speech is also two sentences.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this chapter:\n'Indeed, in a year's stay that I stayed ... needs are fulfilled and a lingerer becomes bored'\nThe verse is by Al-Asha of Bakr bin Wa'il. His name is: Maimun bin Qays bin Jandal. Kunya: Abu Basir. His father Qays was called: The Victim of Hunger; because he entered a cave to shade himself from heat, and a rock fell on the mouth of the cave, so he died of hunger in it! Jahnam mocked him regarding that saying:",

    "text": "'Your father is the Victim of Hunger, Qays bin Jandal ... And your maternal uncle is a suckling slave from Khuma'ah'\nMaimun: A name transferred from adjective to proper noun. Qays and Jandal are also transferred from types. Al-Qays: Intensity, Al-Qays: An idol, Al-Qays: Measurement. Some narrated: 'Thawaituhu' with a damma on the Ta, but the correct way is fatha for the second person address; because before it is:\n'Bid farewell to Hurayra, even if a blamer blames ... Tomorrow morning; or are you despondent about the separation?'\n'Ath-Thawa': Staying. It is said: 'Thawa ar-rajul wa athwa'. He says: Bid farewell to Hurayra, even if the blamer blames you for leaving her, for you have stayed with her for a year, and whoever stays with his beloved for a year has cured his passion and bored of his stay, but you are despondent about leaving her, resolved to stay with her! 'Al-Wajim': The sad and depressed. 'Al-Lubanat': Needs, singular: Lubanah. 'As-Sa'am': Boredom.\n\n'Thawa'in': A substitute (Badal) for 'Hawl' (Year). 'Thawaituhu' is a sentence having a grammatical place; because it is in the place of an adjective for 'Thawa'in'. It is an adjective applied to other than what it belongs to. If you made it a noun, you would say: 'Thawihi anta' (You are its stayer), so the attached pronoun would separate and appear. It is necessary that in this sentence there are two pronouns returning: one to 'Thawa' (stay) from its adjective, and one returning to 'Hawl' (year) from its substitute; because the rule of the adjective is that a returner must return from it to its noun, and the rule of the inclusion substitute (Badal al-Ishtimal) and part-of-whole substitute is that in each there is a pronoun returning to the substituted-from. The Ha in 'Thawaituhu' returns to 'Thawa', and the returner to 'Hawl' is estimated as if he said: 'A stay I stayed *in it*'. A parallel to this grammatical issue is: 'Nafa'ani Abdullah 'ilmun afadanihi' (Abdullah benefited me with knowledge he gave me), meaning he gave me *it*. The Ha in 'afadanihi' returns to 'knowledge', and the hidden 'he' returns to Abdullah.\n\nSome contemporary commentators on the verses of Al-Jumal said: The Ha in 'Thawaituhu' may return to 'Thawa' or to 'Hawl'. That is an error, because if he returns the Ha of 'Thawaituhu' to 'Hawl', the described noun remains without a returner from the sentence which is its adjective. And if he makes it return to 'Thawa', the substituted-from remains without a returner from the substitute, so another pronoun must be estimated as we said.\n\nWhoever narrates: 'Tuqadda' (is fulfilled) and makes it a source (Masdar) added to 'Lubanat', it is permissible that it is the noun of 'Kana', and its predicate is in the prepositional phrase. It is permissible to hide 'the matter/situation' (Al-Amr/Ash-Shan) in 'Kana', and make 'Tuqadda Lubanat' nominative by inchoation (Mubtada), and the predicate in the prepositional phrase before it, and the sentence is the predicate of 'Kana'. In this narration, it is necessary to make 'Wa yas'amu' accusative by hiding 'An' so it becomes a source, coordinating it with 'Tuqadda', as if he said: 'Fulfillment of needs, and boredom of a borer', since it is not valid to coordinate a verb to a noun. Its parallel in grammar is your saying: 'Yu'jibuni darbu Zaydin wa yaghdaya' (Zayd's hitting pleases me and [his] anger), and similarly the saying of Maysun bint Bajdal:\n'Wearing a woolen cloak while my eye is cool ... Is dearer to me than wearing sheer robes'\nThe estimation is: 'Wearing a cloak and the coolness of my eye'. The pattern of 'Tuqadda' from the verb is 'Tafa''ul'. The Dad was given a kasra to make the Ya sound, as the Nun was given kasra in 'At-Tamanni' and Lam in 'At-Tasalli'.\n\nWhoever narrates: 'Tuqda Lubanatun', making 'Lubanat' nominative, and making 'Tuqda' passive voice with 'Lubanat' as its deputy subject, and making 'Wa yas'amu' nominative coordinating with it, then it is necessary to hide 'the matter/situation' in 'Kana' in any case.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter: Divisions of Verbs in Transitivity:\n'I commanded you [to do] good, so do what you were commanded ... For I have left you possessing wealth and possessing property (Nashab)'\nThis verse appeared in Sibawayh's book attributed to Amr bin Ma'adi Yakrub. Al-Hajari mentioned in his Nawadir that it belongs to Al-Asha Tarud. Amr is a name transferred from types to proper nouns. 'Amr' has four meanings: The life/survival (from 'La-'Amr Allah' - an oath by His survival). The flesh between teeth (gums). The earring. The sleeve's edge. In the Hadith: 'There is no harm if a man prostrates on his two Amrs (sleeves).'\n\nAs for Ma'adi Yakrub: Abu al-Abbas Ahmad bin Yahya said: Its meaning is 'Sadness bypassed him' ('Adahu al-karb), i.e., missed him. Abu al-Fath bin Jinni narrated this from Abu Ali al-Farisi. Amr's Kunya is Abu Thawr. Some claimed his Kunya is Abu Rayhana, after a daughter he had, about whom he says:\n'Is it from Rayhana, the hearing caller ... She keeps me awake while my companions are asleep?'\nThis is a mistake; Rayhana is his sister, the mother of Durayd bin as-Simma.\nIt is narrated: 'Dha Nashab' with a dotted Shin. This is how Sibawayh's students narrated it in his book without disagreement. Al-Hajari narrated it with an undotted Seen (Nasab). Whoever narrates it with Seen can say: His saying 'Dha Mal' (possessor of wealth) sufficed over mentioning 'Nashab'. Whoever narrates it with dotted Shin can argue with several points, including: The agreement of the narrators of Sibawayh's book on the Shin.",

    "text": "Among them: Arabs may bring two nouns with the same meaning, like the poet saying:\n'Oh, how lovely is Hind, and a land containing Hind ... And Hind, separated by distance (an-Na'y) and farness (al-Bu'd)'\n'An-Na'y' is exactly 'Al-Bu'd'.\nAmong them: Arabs mostly use 'Nashab' for fixed assets that do not move, like houses and estates, and they mostly apply 'Mal' (wealth) to what is not fixed, like dinars, dirhams, and livestock. Sometimes they apply 'Mal' to everything a human owns, which is correct, due to the Almighty's saying: 'And do not give the foolish your property (Amwalakum)', and this does not specify one thing over another.\n\nAfter this verse:\n'So leave the traits of a people with no character ... And aim for the morals of the people of virtue and literature'\n'You have attained glory, so beware of sullying it ... A noble father and a grandfather not of mixed lineage'\n'Al-Mu'tashib': One whose lineage is not pure. It is said: 'Ashiba al-bayt wa i'tashaba' if it became entangled.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Occupying the Verb from the Object with its Pronoun:\n'I have become such that I do not carry weapons, nor ... Do I control the head of the camel if it bolts'\n'And the wolf, I fear it if I pass by it ... Alone, and I fear the winds and the rain'\nThese two verses are by Ar-Rabi' bin Dab' al-Fazari from Banu Fazara. He is one of the centenarians (Mu'ammarin). He is the one who said:\n'If a youth lives two hundred years ... Then joy and youthfulness have gone'\nAr-Rabi', Dab', and Fazara: Are names transferred from genera and types to proper nouns. As for Ar-Rabi': It is the known season of the year, and Ar-Rabi' is rain, and Ar-Rabi' is the grass growing from it, and Ar-Rabi' is the dust between the pasture.\nAd-Dab': A type of predator (Hyena). The female is called 'Dab'', and the male 'Dhib'an'. Ad-Dab' also means a drought year, likened to the hyena. In the Hadith: A man said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the Hyena (drought) has eaten us.' Al-Abbas bin Mirdas said:\n'O Abu Khurasha, as for you being of a group ... Indeed my people, the Hyena has not eaten them'\nAs for Fazara: It is the female leopard. The 'Hidibbas' is the male, and 'Al-Fizr' is its cub if male, and 'Al-Fizra' is the female. The poet said:\n'And I saw a female leopard and a male ... And the cub follows its mother like the wild cat'\n\nHis saying: 'La ahmilu as-silah' (I do not carry weapons), and 'Wa la amliku...' (Nor do I control...) are two sentences in the place of accusative as the predicate (Khabar) of 'Asbaha' (became) if you consider it incomplete, or in the place of State (Hal) if you consider it complete and independent of a predicate, as if he said: 'I became not carrying weapons, nor controlling the camel's head if it flees from me!'\n\nIn 'Adh-Dhi'b' (The wolf), nominative (Raf') and accusative (Nasb) are allowed; Raf' by inchoation (Mubtada), and Nasb by hiding a verb; as if he said: 'And I fear the wolf, I fear it'. The choice is Nasb; because the verse before it starts with a verb, so it is preferred to hide a verb for 'the wolf', to coordinate what a verb acted upon with what a verb acted upon, seeking similarity in wording. It is allowed that this sentence is coordinated with the Major Sentence (Jumlah Kubra), which is: 'Asbahtu la ahmilu...'. And it is allowed that this sentence is coordinated with the Minor Sentence (Jumlah Sughra), which is: 'La ahmilu as-silah'.\n\nThe Major Sentence: Is every sentence that has no grammatical place. The Minor Sentence: Is every sentence that has a grammatical place. Because every sentence where a single word can be estimated in its place has a grammatical place, and every sentence where a single word cannot be estimated in its place has no grammatical place. The Major is like saying: 'Zaydun abuhu muntaliqun' (Zayd, his father is leaving). This entire sentence is called Major. As for your saying: 'Abuhu muntaliqun' (His father is leaving), it is called Minor; because it is in the place of the predicate of the subject, and it is part of the Major Sentence. A sentence can be Minor and Major in two different ways; like saying: 'Zaydun abuhu ghulamuhu muntaliqun' (Zayd, his father, his servant is leaving). This sentence is Major. Your saying: 'Ghulamuhu muntaliqun' is Minor; because it is a predicate for the father. Your saying: 'Abuhu ghulamuhu muntaliqun' is Minor relative to Zayd, and Major relative to the servant.\n\nHis saying: 'Wahdi' (Alone): In the place of accusative as State (Hal), as if he said: 'If I pass by it alone'. His saying: 'In nafara' (If it bolts), and 'In marartu bihi' (If I pass by it): Are two conditions that did not have a response (jawab) come after them; because the preceding speech sufficed as the response. It is like saying: 'I thank you if you do good to me'.\nThe meaning of the poetry: Due to his extreme old age, his strength has weakened to carry weapons to war, and he has reached a state where he cannot control a camel if he rides it, and he fears the wolf might attack him, and he is harmed by the wind if it blows, and rains if they fall. This is similar to his saying in another poem:\n'When winter comes, warm me up ... For indeed the elder, winter destroys him'",

    "text": "'And as for when every cold departs ... Then a thin garment or a cloak'\nThis is like the Arabs saying in their proverbs: 'I was when I did not fear the wolf, and I was when the camel could not be led against me!!'\nThe apparent meaning of Ar-Rabi's statement contradicts the saying of some centenarians:\n'Abu Zayd lent my right hand his weapon ... And some weapons of Time for a man are like pain'\n'And I was such that if the dog denied its people ... I recognized them, while the dog was awake yet asleep'\nBecause Ar-Rabi' negated carrying weapons from himself due to old age, while this second one describes that he aged and thus carries Abu Zayd's weapon! Ar-Rabi' meant: He cannot carry weapons *to war*! As for Abu Zayd's weapon that this one describes carrying, it is: The staff that the elder leans upon. Abu Zayd: A Kunya for Time (Ad-Dahr). It is also nicknamed: Abu Sa'd. It is said: Abu Sa'd is the Kunya of old age. This meaning is what Al-Isba' al-Adwani meant by saying:\n'Do you not see my equipment: The spear of Abu Sa'd ... Indeed I carry weapons together'\n\nNarrators reported: Ar-Rabi' bin Dab' lived until he reached Islam, and he came to Syria to Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan with a grandson of his. His grandson entered upon Muawiyah, so Muawiyah said to him: 'Sit, O Shaykh!' He said: 'And how can one sit whose grandfather is at the door?!' Muawiyah said: 'Perhaps from the children of Ar-Rabi' bin Dab'?' He said: 'Yes.' So he ordered him to enter. When he entered, Muawiyah asked him about his age? He said:\n'The Jarib (valley) to the two Zujjs has become desolate of Mayya ... Except for the gazelles and the cows'\n'As if she was a soft pearl ... From women who were pearls before her'\n'Youth has become early departing from me ... If it distances itself from me, it has stayed for ages'\n'It left us before we left it ... When it finished its desire of our union'\n'Here I am, bored of life, and ... My age and birth have reached Hujr'\n'O Abu Imru' al-Qays, have you heard of him? ... Far, far away! This time is long'\n'I have become such that I do not carry weapons, nor ... Do I control the head of the camel if it bolts'\n'And the wolf, I fear it if I pass by it ... Alone, and I fear the winds and the rain'\n'After a strength I used to rejoice in ... I have become an elder treating old age'\nSo Muawiyah, may Allah have mercy on him, recited: 'And he to whom We grant long life We reverse in creation.'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Particles that Raise the Noun and Install the Predicate (Inna and sisters):\n'Qays's destruction was not the destruction of one ... But it was the structure of a people that collapsed'\nThis verse is by 'Abda bin at-Tabib. He is from Banu Abd Shams bin Ka'b bin Sa'd bin Zayd Manat from Tamim. 'Abda': Feminine of 'Abd', transferred from adjectives behaving like nouns. At-Tabib: The skilled one in things, proficient in them. Alqama bin Abda said about it:\n'If you ask me about women, then I am ... Insightful regarding the illnesses of women, a doctor'\nThis 'Abda' has a still Ba. As for 'Abadah' Abu Alqama, he has a moving Ba. 'Abda bin at-Tabib restricted this by describing himself:\n'They give glad tidings that 'Abda is coming ... No, by the One who gathered the pilgrims at Mina'\nThis verse is from a poem mourning Qays bin Asim al-Minqari, the master of Banu Minqar. Before it:\n'Upon you is the peace of Allah, O Qays bin Asim ... And His mercy as long as He wills to have mercy'\n'A greeting from one whom you left as a target of destruction ... When he visited your land from a distance, he greeted'\n\nThe Ha in 'Walakinnahu' (But it/he): Returns to 'Al-Hulk' (The destruction). The meaning: But his destruction is the collapse of the structure of a people that collapsed; i.e., the house of their glory collapsed. 'Bunyan' here: A source used as a noun, meaning the building itself, because the 'Bunyan' meant as a source is not described by collapsing. In the Hadith: 'Whoever destroys the building of Allah is cursed.' Meaning: Killing a Muslim soul that did not deserve death.\nHis saying: 'Ma sha'a an yatarahhama': 'Ma' here is estimated with the verb as a source, and the source stands in place of an adverb of time. As if he said: 'The duration of His willing mercy'. And He, Glory be to Him, wills with His mercy whoever He has mercy upon eternally. 'Tahiyya' (Greeting): An emphatic source, because his saying 'Upon you is the peace of Allah' conveyed the meaning of greeting. It is like the Almighty's saying: '[This is] the decree of Allah upon you', and like Zuhair's saying:\n'Know, by the life of Allah, this is an oath ... So estimate by your arm span and see where you go'\n\nHis saying: 'Gharad ar-rada' (Target of destruction): Accusative as State (Hal), even if added to a definite, because its meaning is like an adjective, i.e., 'Intended by destruction'. Its addition is estimated as separated, as if he said: 'Gharadan li-r-rada' (A target for destruction), i.e., intended for it.\nHis saying: 'Idha zara 'an shahtin biladaka sallama' (When he visited your land from a distance, he greeted): Can be a substitute (Badal) for 'Gharad ar-rada', so the sentence has a grammatical place. It can also be a substitute for the Ha in 'Ghadarathu' (Left him), so the sentence has no place, just as the adjective has no place.",

    "text": "Abu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'As if a wine bought (Sabi'ah) from Bayt Ras ... Its mixture is honey and water'\nThis verse is by Hassan bin Thabit bin al-Mundhir bin Haram al-Ansari. Kunya: Abu al-Walid. His name is improvised, not transferred, but it is derived from 'Al-Husn' (Beauty), so its pattern is 'Fa'al' (diptote/morphologically flexible). It could be derived from 'Al-Hiss' (Sensation), so its pattern is 'Fa'lan', diptote due to the addition at the end and being a proper noun. The most analogous is that it is diptote (not fully declined), because Hassan did not decline his name in his saying:\n'The traces of the station did not stir Hassan ... Nor the journey of the tribe nor the building of tents'\nAs for Thabit, Al-Mundhir, and Haram: They are transferred names, not improvised. Thabit and Al-Mundhir: Descriptions from names transferred from adjectives. As for Haram: It could be transferred from their saying 'Rajulun haram', i.e., in a state of Ihram, so it is from names transferred from adjectives. It could be transferred from 'Al-Haram' which is the opposite of Halal, transferred to names from adjectives, assuming it was used as a description, so it was said: 'A thing forbidden'. Al-Haram is also a name for ants.\n\n'As-Sabi'ah': Wine that is bought. It is said: 'Saba'tu al-khamra' with Hamza if you bought it. It is 'Fa'ilah' with the meaning of 'Maf'ulah' (passive). Ibn Harma said:\n'Expensive, trembling, aged ... Its buying price is high in the hands of merchants'\nHe meant by 'Ar-Ras': The head of vintners, and specified him because his wine is older than others'. Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad said: Bayt Ras is a place.\nIt is narrated: 'Ka'anna Sulafatan'. As-Sulafa: The first that flows from the wine. It is said: It is what flows from grapes without pressing. Supporting this is the poet's saying:\n'From the old vines it came as Sulaf ... The presser did not tread on it with his foot'\nHe meant: The juice came as Sulaf that he did not tread with his foot!\n\nRegarding his saying: 'Yakunu mizajuha 'asalun wa ma'un' (Its mixture is honey and water), there are four opinions:\n1. It is due to poetic necessity, and Sibawayh recited it as such.\n2. He meant 'Mizajan laha' (A mixture for it), intending separation by the addition (Idafa), so he reported with an indefinite about an indefinite.\n3. 'Mizajuha' is accusative as an adverb standing in place of the predicate, not the predicate itself, as if he said: 'Yakunu [mustaqirran] fi mizajiha' (It is stable in its mixture).\n4. This was allowed because honey and water are types (species), and types resemble indefinites. Saying 'I ate the honey' and 'I ate honey', and 'I drank the water' and 'I drank water' is the same; because it is known you didn't eat the entire species of honey or drink the entire species of water. This is because types and genera do not have specific names for their parts qua parts; rather, every part of the genus is expressed by the genus name. Every part of water is called 'water'.\n\nAbu Uthman al-Mazini used to narrate: 'Yakunu mizajuha' with Raf' (nominative), making it the noun of 'Yakunu', and installing 'Asalan' as its predicate, and raising 'Ma'un' by a hidden verb indicated by 'Al-Mizaj', as if he said: 'Wa mazajaha ma'un' (And water mixed it).\nHis saying: 'Min Bayt' is in the place of an adjective for 'Sabi'ah'. 'Yakunu mizajuha' is also in the place of an adjective for it, as if he said: 'A wine bought from Bayt Ras, being its mixture honey and water.' As for the predicate of 'Ka'anna' upon which the comparison falls, it is in another verse after this, which is:\n'Upon her canine teeth, or the taste of a fresh ... Apple whose fruit was crushed by the picker'\n\nGrammarians usually make 'Ka'anna' for comparison wherever it occurs. That is not correct. It is only pure comparison if a noun representing its subject falls in the predicate, and the predicate is more elevated or lower than it, like saying: 'Ka'anna Zaydan malakun' (As if Zayd is an angel) or 'Ka'anna Zaydan himarun' (As if Zayd is a donkey). But if its predicate is a verb, an adverb, a prepositional phrase, or an adjective of its subject's adjectives, then the meaning of doubt and supposition enters it, like saying: 'Ka'anna Zaydan qa'imun' (It seems Zayd is standing), or 'Ka'anna Zaydan fi ad-dar' (It seems Zayd is in the house). You are not comparing Zayd to anything here; you only think he is standing or in the house. Similarly, the poet's saying:\n'I treated her until she recovered, an Abyssinian [she-camel] ... As if silk and green fabric were upon her'\nIt also has other meanings not mentioned here.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:",

    "text": "'Stop before separating, O Duba'a ... And let not the situation/position (Mawqif) from you be the farewell'\nThis verse is by Al-Qatami. His name is: Umair bin Shuyaym. Umair is a transferred name; if you wish, make it the diminutive of 'Amr', which is the earring, or life, or sleeve edge, or flesh between teeth. If you wish, make it the diminutive of their saying: 'Rajulun 'Amir' (A man constantly visiting/performing Umrah). If you wish, it is a truncated diminutive of 'Amir', 'Ammar', or 'Mu'ammar', like Zuhair from Azhar.\nAs for 'Shuyaym' with damma or kasra on the Shin: Transferred from the diminutive of 'Ashyam' truncated, which is one with a mole (Shamah). Al-Qatami is transferred from the hawk, because the hawk is called 'Qatam'. 'Qatam' with damma or fatha on Qaf, derived from 'Qatam', which is the craving for meat or craving for intercourse. It is said: 'Fahlun Qatim' if he is excited for mating. It is a nickname that prevailed upon him due to his saying:\n'The striking Qatami (Hawk) strikes them side by side ... The fleeing sandgrouse'\nThe witness in the verse is the raising of 'Mawqif' (position) which is indefinite, and installing 'Al-Wada'a' (Farewell) which is definite. This was facilitated because the noun of 'Kana' and its predicate are for one thing, and his saying 'Minki' (from you) is in the place of Raf' as an adjective for 'Mawqif', as if he said: 'A position being from you'. When the indefinite is described, it is strengthened by the adjective and approaches the definite. Since the indefinite was strengthened by the adjective, and the definition by Alif-Lam is weak having no strength of other definitions, 'Al-Wada'' and 'Mawqif' became as if they were equivalent. It is narrated: 'Wa la yaku mawqifi' with addition (my position), which requires no speculation.\nDuba'a, whom he flirted with, is: Duba'a bint Zufar bin al-Harith al-Kilabi, whom he praised in this poem. Therefore, he said after this verse:\n'Stop, ransom your prisoner, for indeed my people ... And your people, I do not see for them a meeting'\n'And how can they meet with what they permitted ... Of the great sanctities and what they wasted?'\n'Did I not inform you that the ropes of Qays ... And Taghlib have separated in severance?'\nIt is said: 'Wada'' with fatha on Waw and 'Wida'' with kasra. 'Wida'' with kasra was the source of 'Wada'tu wida'an' (I bid farewell), and 'Wada'' with fatha was the noun.\n\nHe recited in this Chapter:\n'For I am not [a son] of a human, but for a king ... Descending from the atmosphere of the sky, diving down'\nThis verse is by Alqama bin Abda, narrated at the end of his poem starting with:\n'A heart inclined to beautiful women has carried you away ... After youth, at the time graying arrived'\nAbu Ubayda Ma'mar bin al-Muthanna mentioned it belongs to a man from Abd al-Qays. Alqama and Abda (with open Ba) are transferred names. Alqama: One unit of colocynth (bitter plant). It is said: 'Food with Alqama', i.e., bitterness. Abda: The mixing stone for perfume. Abda is also: The lion's thicket. Abda is disdain; it is said: 'Abida mina ash-shay'i ya'badu abdan wa abdatan' if he disdained it.\n\nThe Lam in 'Li-insiyyin' is attached to a deleted element, likewise in 'Li-malakin'. Both have a grammatical place; because the first Lam fell in the place of the predicate of 'Laysa', so it hangs on the predicate it substituted, i.e., 'I am not a son of a human'. The second Lam in 'Li-malakin' fell in the place of a predicate for a subject, as if he said: 'But you are for a king'.\nHis saying: 'Tanazzala min jaww...' is a sentence in the place of an adjective for 'Malik'. 'Yaswubu' is a sentence in the place of State (Hal) from the pronoun in 'Tanazzala'. It is allowed to be a second adjective for 'Malik'. The meaning of 'Yaswubu': Intends towards the earth (dives).\nHe meant 'Li-Mal'akin' (For an angel), so he brought it on the original form, because 'Malik' is a lightening of 'Mal'ak', the vowel of its Hamza transferred to its Lam, as they said in 'Yas'alu': 'Ysalu', and 'Sham'al' in 'Shamal'. The poet said:\n'Malik stayed in the lands of the enemy ... The winds of the north (Sham'al) blow upon him'\nThere is disagreement on the weight of 'Mal'ak'. Most morphology scholars said its weight is 'Ma'fal', inverted from 'Ma'lak'. They argued with the Arabs' saying: 'Alaka' if he sent, and calling a message 'Aluk' and 'Alukah'. Labid said:\n'And a boy whose mother sent him ... With a message (Aluk), so we gave what he asked'\nAbu Bakr bin Duraid recited:\n'So who will convey to the youths of my people a message ... Coming from the kings of those who disbelieved?'\nAbu Ubayd al-Qasim bin Sallam said: Its weight is 'Maf'al', derived from 'La'aka' if he sent, so there is no inversion in it. It is possible that 'La'aka' is inverted from 'Alaka'. Ibn Kaysan claimed that 'Malak' is derived from 'Malaka Yamliku' (to possess), and the Hamza in 'Mal'ak' is extra like its addition in 'Sham'al'. The weight of 'Mala'ikah' (Angels) according to those who make it inverted is 'Ma'afilah' (inverted from Ma'alikah). According to Abu Ubayd: 'Mafa'ilah', not inverted. According to Ibn Kaysan: 'Fa'a'ilah'.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:",

    "text": "'When winter comes, warm me up ... For indeed the elder, winter destroys him'\nThis verse is by Ar-Rabi' bin Dab' al-Fazari, mentioned earlier. It is from a poem praising his sons and his quiver, mentioning their kindness to him:\n'O deliver to my sons, the sons of Rabi' ... For the scoundrels of sons are a ransom for you'\n'That I have aged and my skin has thinned ... So let not women distract you from me'\n'And indeed my quiver is [like] truthful women ... And my sons did not fall short nor did they do evil'\n'When winter comes, warm me up ... For indeed the elder, winter destroys him'\n'And as for when every cold departs ... Then a thin garment or a cloak'\n'If a youth lives two hundred years ... Then joy and youthfulness have gone'\n'Al-Andhal': Lowly ones, singular 'Nadhl'. Meaning of 'Alla': Fell short in kindness. It is said: 'Ala alwan'. If you increase the action, you say 'Alla yu'alli ta'liyatan'. Zuhair said:\n'A people strove after them to catch them ... But they did not act, nor blame, nor fall short'\n'Al-Qarr': The cold. 'Al-Fata' (shortened): Singular of 'Fityan' (Youths). 'Al-Fata'' (extended): Youthfulness of age. It is said: 'Fata bayyin al-fata''. It is narrated: 'Al-Muru'ah' (Chivalry) and 'Al-Ladhadhah' (Pleasure). 'At-Takhayyul': Arrogance and self-admiration. It is narrated: 'Yahrimuhu' (Ages him).\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'How will it be when you pass by a house of people ... And neighbors to us who were noble?'\nThis verse is by Al-Farazdaq. His name is Hammam bin Ghalib. Ibn Qutayba said: Humaym bin Ghalib. Kunya: Abu Firas. Ibn Qutayba's speech differed regarding his nickname Al-Farazdaq. In 'Adab al-Katib' he said: Al-Farazdaq is pieces of dough, singular 'Farazdaqa', a nickname for him because he was grim-faced! In 'Tabaqat ash-Shu'ara', he said: He was nicknamed Al-Farazdaq for his thickness and shortness, likened to the crumb-paste women drink, which is Al-Farazdaqa. The first opinion is more correct; because he had smallpox on his face, then recovered, but his face remained grim and hateful. It is narrated a man said to him: 'O Abu Firas, your face looks like gathered vulvas!' He said: 'Look closely, do you see your mother's among them?!'\nThis verse is from a poem praising Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik bin Marwan and mocking Jarir bin al-Khatafi. It is said this verse is:\n'Are you turning aside with us briefly (La'anna) ... To see the courtyards or the traces of tents?'\n'I hold back the tears of my eyes ... And after tears there is no blame'\n'La'anna': A dialect of 'La'allana' (Perhaps we). It is said: 'La'allaka', 'La'annaka' (with dotted Ghayn and Nun), 'La'annaka', 'Ra'anka', 'Allaka', 'Annaka', 'Law annaka' - all with one meaning.\nIt is narrated that he recited this poem to Sulayman, and when he reached:\n'Three and two, so they are five ... And a sixth leaning towards my smelling [or Shimam mountain]'\n'They were pushed to me, no one touched them before me ... And they are healthier than ostrich eggs'\n'They spent the night beside me thrown down ... And I spent the night breaking the seals of the rings'\n'As if the latches of pomegranate in it ... And ember of Ghada wood they sat upon is hot'\nSulayman said: 'You have confessed to adultery in my presence, and I am the Imam (Leader), and the Hadd punishment must be established upon you!' Al-Farazdaq said: 'From where did you obligate it upon me, O Commander of the Faithful?' He said: 'Allah Almighty says: \"The woman and the man guilty of adultery, flog each of them with a hundred stripes\".' Al-Farazdaq said: 'The Book of Allah Almighty averts the Hadd from me. Allah, Blessed and Exalted, says: \"And the poets - the deviators follow them. Do you not see that in every valley they roam, and that they say what they do not do?\" And I only said what I did not do!' Sulayman smiled and said: 'Woe to you!!'\n\nAbu al-Qasim followed the path of Al-Khalil and Sibawayh regarding Al-Farazdaq's verse, making 'Kana' in it redundant (Za'ida). Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad rejected that and said: The Waw in 'Kanu' is the noun of 'Kana', and 'Lana' is its predicate, as if he said: 'And neighbors, noble, who were ours.' A group of grammarians followed Abu al-Abbas, saying: How can 'Kana' be nullified from work when the pronoun is attached to it?! This objection does not hold; because 'Zhanantu' (I thought) is nullified from work despite the pronoun's attachment in saying: 'Zaydun muntaliqun zhanantu'. We mentioned in the first book what Abu Ali al-Farisi and Ibn Jinni argued for Al-Khalil, which suffices repeating here.",

    "text": "The place of 'Lana' is genitive (Khafḍ) according to Al-Khalil's view, because it is in the place of an adjective for 'Jiran' (neighbors). It is in the place of accusative (Nasb) according to Abu al-Abbas's view, because it is in the place of the predicate of 'Kana'.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'When I die, people will be two types: A rejoicer [at my death] ... And another praising what I used to do'\nThis verse is by Al-'Ajir as-Saluli, attributed to Banu Salul, a tribe of the Arabs. 'Ajir: Transferred name. Possibly diminutive of 'Ajar', from 'Ajara 'unuqahu' (twisted his neck). Possibly truncated diminutive of 'A'jar' (Protruding navel). As-Saluli: Improvised name.\nIt is narrated: 'Mittu' and 'Muttu' (kasra/damma on Meem). Narrated: 'Sinfani' (Two types - Nom.), 'Sinfayni' (Acc./Gen.), and 'Nisfayni' (Two halves). Whoever raises it hides 'the matter/situation' in 'Kana', making 'An-nasu sinfani' a subject and predicate clause in place of 'Kana's' predicate. Whoever installs makes 'An-nasa' the noun of 'Kana' and 'Sinfayni' its predicate; there is no witness in this narration. 'Shamitun' and 'Akharu' are raised as predicates of a hidden subject, as if explaining the two types: 'They are a rejoicer and another praising'. It is allowed to raise 'Shamitun' as a substitute (Badal) for 'As-Sinfan'. It is allowed the estimation is: 'One of them is a rejoicer, and the other praising'.\nAfter this verse:\n'But there will weep for me calamities and a council ... And disheveled ones humiliated in councils, starving'\n'And a seeker of refuge whom the people struck a blow ... Far from allies, obtaining what he used to gather'\n'I returned to him what the weak opinion missed in the forenoon ... And yesterday, until he returned to us leaning'\n'And he was not - that he was - my cousin nor my brother ... But whenever I can remove harm, I am useful'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'She is the cure for my disease if I attained her ... And not from her is the cure of the disease granted'\nThis verse is by Hisham, brother of Dhu al-Rumma. It is an improvised name derived from 'Hashamtu ash-shay' (I broke the thing). Abu al-Fath mentioned: Transferred from the source 'Hashamtu'.\nIt is possible that 'Laysa' in this verse is the operator, so 'the matter/situation' is hidden in it, and the sentence is its predicate. It is possible it is like 'Ma' which does no work, a dialect of some Arabs. Regarding 'Law', it can be the one indicating the impossibility of a thing due to the impossibility of another, and the answer is deleted, as if he said: 'If I attained her, I would be cured', so the mention of cure beforehand sufficed. Just as we say: 'I thank you if you do good to me'. It is possible 'Law' is for wishful thinking, as if he said: 'Would that I attained her'.\nThe Ba in 'Biha' is attached to 'Zhafirtu'. 'Min' in 'Minha' is attached to 'Mabdhul', having no place as it attaches to an apparent word.\nAfter this verse:\n'She reveals the side-teeth of one with serrated teeth when she smiles ... As if he is watered with wine, saturated'\n'Tajlu': Reveals/Shows. 'Al-'Awarid': The premolars/laughing teeth. 'Az-Zulm': Water flowing on the teeth (luster). 'Al-Munhal': Given a first drink. 'Al-Ma'lul': Given a second drink. 'Ar-Rah': Wine.\nThis verse is also narrated for Ka'b bin Zuhair, and for Hisham.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Particles that Install Nouns and Raise Predicates:\n'O Muawiyah, indeed we are humans, so be kind ... For we are not mountains nor iron'\nThis verse is by Uqaybah al-Asadi, as mentioned by Sibawayh. Uqaybah: Transferred name. Possibly diminutive of 'Aqabah' (small difficult pass). Or diminutive of 'Uqbah' (like Zulmah) - remains of broth/meat in a borrowed pot. Or 'Uqbah' in riding. Or 'Uqbat al-Qamar' (return of the moon). The poet said:\n'His lock of hair does not taste washing or oils ... Nor scented powder except at the return of the moon'\nAsad: Transferred name, possibly from the lion (Asad), or source of 'Asida ar-rajulu' (became lion-like/brave).\n'Az-Zubayr': Transferred name. Zubayr: Mud/Slime. Zubayr: A well lined with stones. Zubayr: A written book. Ibn Jinni recited: 'Like the written scroll and the Zubayr'. Zubayr: Calamity. Zubayr: Insult/Humiliation.\n\nSibawayh recited this verse as 'Wa la al-hadida' (Nor iron) with Nasb, as Abu al-Qasim recited, and rejected it upon him. It is said the poetry has genitive (Khafd) rhymes, which is:\n'O Muawiyah, indeed we are humans, so be kind ... For we are not mountains nor iron'\n'You ate our land and stripped it bare ... So is there any standing crop or harvested?'\n'Do you hope for eternity when we perish ... While there is no eternity for us nor for you?'\n'So consider us a nation that perished in waste ... Your emir increases, and Abu Yazid'\n'Leave the betrayal of leadership and be upright ... And the advancing of the lowlifes and slaves'\n\nThose who argued for Sibawayh claimed: This verse is from a poem attributed to Abdullah bin az-Zubayr al-Asadi. It is said: It is by Al-Kumayt bin Ma'ruf al-Asadi, saying in it:\n'Calamities threw the women of the family of Amr ... With a decree to which they stood stunned'\n'It turned their black hair white ... And turned their white faces black'\n'Turn it over, O Banu Harb, upon yourselves ... And do not shoot the far target with it'\nIt is not denied that the verse belongs to both poems; because poets may borrow speech, or take a verse exactly without changing it, like Al-Farazdaq:\n'You see people, when we walk, walking behind us ... And if we nod to the people, they stop'\nThis verse belongs to Jamil bin Abdullah, plagiarized by Al-Farazdaq. Qays bin al-Khatim said:\n'If our swords fall short, their connection is ... Our steps towards our enemies, so we strike'\nThe poem has genitive rhymes. Al-Akhnas bin Shihab al-Yashkuri said:\n'And if our swords fall short, their connection is ... Our steps towards our enemies, so we strike'\nThe poem has nominative rhymes.",

To inhabiting wild beasts, and Time has consequences'\n'Time took its turn on them so they departed ...

Time drank upon them and ate'\nAbu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad recited it in 'Al-Kamil' according to Imru' al-Qays's poetry but attributed it to An-Nabigha al-Ja'di, which is a mistake.\nSometimes a poet repeats a single verse of his poetry in two poems with different rhymes, like Al-Husayn bin al-Humam al-Murri:\n'When I saw that affection is not beneficial to me ... Even if it was a day of stars, dark'\n'We were patient, and patience was a nature of ours ... With our swords cutting a hand and a wrist'\n'Splitting heads of people dear ...

Even if it was a day of a star, gray'\n'We were patient, and patience was a nature of ours ... With our swords cutting heads and a shoulder'\n'Splitting heads of men dear ... To us, while they were more disobedient and destructive'\nIn the poetry of Abu at-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi, there are many verses he plagiarized, changing only a little, like his saying:\n'As if every request in his ears ... Is the shirt of Joseph in the eyelids of Jacob'\nThis verse is transferred from Al-Husayn's saying:\n'As if every request in his ears ... Is the shirt of Joseph in the eyelids of his father'\nAnd his saying:\n'And of the misery of the world upon the freeman is that he sees ... An enemy for whom he has no escape from friendship'\nThis verse is transferred from Ishaq al-Mawsili's saying:\n'And of the misery of the world upon the freeman is that he sees ... An enemy, so he desires it to be said: A friend'\nIf the matter of poetry is of this attribute, it is not denied that his saying: 'O Muawiyah, indeed we are humans, so be kind...' occurred in two different poems by Uqaybah al-Asadi, or occurred in a poem by Uqaybah with genitive rhymes, and a poem by Ibn az-Zubayr with accusative rhymes.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Prepositions:",

    "text": "'So I said to the riders when appeared to them ... From the right of Al-Hubayya a look from the front (Qabal)'\nThis verse is by Al-Qatami, whose name we mentioned. After it:\n'Was it a glimpse of the brightness of lightning my sight saw ... Or the face of a high woman, by whom the curtains strutted?'\n'She sends to us whenever our position is high ... The scent of lavender in which dew flowed, moist'\nAl-Hubayya: A place in Syria. It is of the names that came diminutive and have no non-diminutive form. Meaning of 'Nazratun Qabal': A look not preceded by another look. It is said: 'Ra'aytu al-hilala qabalan', meaning no one saw it before me. 'Ar-Rakb': Plural of 'Rakib' according to Al-Akhfash; according to Sibawayh it is a collective noun, not a plural. It is narrated: 'Ala bihim' and 'Alat bihim': Meaning made them ascend and overlook to look at its top. It is like saying: 'A'laytuhum', because Ba and Hamza alternate in making verbs transitive, like: 'Dhahabtu bihi' and 'Adh-habtuhu'. 'Sana al-barq': Its light. 'Ikhtalat': Strutted/walked proudly. 'Al-Kilal': Curtains, singular 'Killah'. He meant the face of a high woman appeared to them from behind the curtain, so they looked at it in wonder. Whoever narrates 'Biha' returns the pronoun to 'Aliyah'. Whoever narrates 'Bihi' returns it to the face. If feminine, the sentence is a State (Hal) for 'Aliyah'; if masculine, a State for the Face. 'Whenever our position was high': i.e., in a high place hit by wind. It is said: 'So-and-so sat on the high part of the wind', i.e., in an overlooking place hit by wind. 'Al-Khadil': Very wet.\nHe made 'An' (from/about) a noun and introduced the preposition upon it. In this verse is a witness that 'An' is a noun, and a witness that 'Ala' is a verb.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this verse:\n'She went early from upon it after her thirst was complete ... Clucking, and from a shell (Qayd) in a distinct desert'\nThis verse is by Muzahim bin al-Harith al-Uqayli. Muzahim and Al-Harith are names transferred from adjectives to proper nouns. The ram is nicknamed Abu Muzahim if it has great horns. He is called Ash-Shaqhatab. Before it:\n'Is that, or a sandgrouse (Kudriyyah) whose chick remained ... Thrown in Sharawra like the dependent orphan'\nHe meant by Kudriyyah: A sandgrouse with turbidity in its color. Sandgrouse are two types: Kudri and Juni. Kudri: Dusty colored. Juni: Black colored. Zuhair mentioned it:\n'Juni sandgrouse, like the stones of Al-Qism is their pasture ... In As-Siyy, there is no Astragalus or Caltrop'\n'Al-Laqa': The thrown thing not paid attention to. Sharawra: A place. He likened it in its isolation and bad state to the orphan. 'Al-Mu'ayyal': The poor. Al-Asma'i said: He said 'Laqa bi-Sharawra' because sandgrouse only lay eggs in the ground in hollows, not in trees. 'Ghadat min 'alayhi ba'da ma tamma': She stayed with her chick until she needed water, became thirsty, and flew seeking water when her thirst was complete. 'Az-Zhim'': The duration of patience from water. It is narrated: 'Ba'da ma tamma khimsuha', i.e., coming to water every five days. He didn't mean she waits five days; that is for camels, not birds, but he used it as a metaphor. This is Abu Hatim's view, thus the narration 'Zhim'uha' is better. Al-Asma'i said: 'Min 'alayhi' means from above the chick. Abu Ubayda said: It means she went from *at* her chick. Yaqub said: 'After her thirst was complete' means she drank every three or four days once.\nAbu Hatim said: I said to Al-Asma'i: How did he say 'Ghadat' (went early morning) when sandgrouse go to water at night? He said: He didn't mean morning, but it is a metaphor for haste. The Arabs say: 'Bakkarat ilayya al-ashiyya' (She came early to me in the evening) while there is no morning (Bukur) there. Abu Zayd recited:\n'She came early reading a script after midnight in the dew ... Forbidden upon you is my blame and rebuke'\nAn-Nabigha adh-Dhubyani used this similarly:\n'Avoiding a black rock-line, its bottoms ... The walk of the morning slave-girls carrying bundles'\nAbu Hatim said: Meaning of 'Tasillu': Her insides make a sound from thirst and dryness. 'As-Salil': Sound of dry things. Others said: Meant she makes noise in flying. 'Al-Qayd': Top shell of the egg. Narrated: 'Bi-zayza'a majhali' adding Zayza' to Majhal. 'Az-Zayza'': Rough ground. 'Al-Majhal': Desolate land without landmarks. Narrated: 'Bi-bayda'a': Desert that destroys ('Tabidu') who travels it.\n'Zhalla farkhuha': Sentence with grammatical place (Adjective for Kudriyyah). 'Tasillu': Accusative as State.\n'Adhalika': Refers to a male ostrich mentioned before:\n'I crossed with a swift she-camel, as if her saddles ... Were upon a dyer (ostrich) mounting the rough grounds, huge'",

    "text": "Abu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Hatta:\n'So oh wonder! Even Kulayb insults me ... As if their father is Nahshal or Mujashi'\nThis verse is by Al-Farazdaq. We mentioned his name earlier. It is narrated: 'Fa-ya 'ajaban' with Nunation, and 'Ya 'ajaba' without. Whoever nunates it has two ways: 1. Indefinite vocative. 2. A source (Masdar), with the vocative deleted, as if saying: 'O my people, wonder a wonder'. Whoever does not nunate has two ways: 1. (Better) Added vocative, dialect of 'Ya ghulama aqbil'. As if saying: 'O wonder, be present; for this is your time'. 2. Intending 'Ya 'ajabah' (Oh wonder!), mostly used in lamentation, but used elsewhere.\nHis saying: 'Hatta Kulaybun tasubbuni': Speech uttered in contempt of Kulayb, because 'Hatta' (Even) is used for contempt or magnification. 'Hatta' did not operate grammatically on the word because it does not operate on sentence phrases, only their positions. There is a deletion, as if saying: 'Do people insult me, such that even Kulayb insults me?!' The Kufans allow lowering 'Kulaybin' on the basis of limit (Ghayah), making 'Tasubbuni' emphatic.\nMeaning: Even Kulayb is in this state of cursing. 'As-Sib' (with kasra) is one who abuses you. It is said the verse is:\n'We seized the horizons of the sky over you ... Ours are its two moons, the stars, and the rising ones'\n'Step aside from the Batha (valley), for its ancient part ... Is ours, and the anchored towering mountains'\n'And we used to, if the tyrant twisted his cheek ... Strike him until the neck veins straightened'\nAl-Mufaddal said: He meant by the two moons: Muhammad and Ibrahim (peace be upon them), and by the stars: The guided Caliphs.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'I traveled by night with them until their raid mounts became weary ... And until the steeds were not led by reins'\nThis verse is from the famous poetry of Imru' al-Qays. 'Al-Qays': Intensity (according to Ali bin Hamza). Others said: Name of an idol. Al-Asma'i disliked saying 'Imru' al-Qays' and narrated 'O Imru' Allah'. Kunya: Abu Wahb, Abu al-Harith. Name said to be Jundah, Imru' al-Qays is a nickname. 'Al-Jundah': Yellow dune. 'As-Sura': Night travel. 'Ma yuqadna bi-arsan': They were exhausted so they didn't need leading.\n'Bi-him' attached to 'Saraytu'. 'Takillu matiyyuhum': Sentence in place of Genitive by 'Hatta', estimated as a source standing for a time adverb: 'Until the time of the weariness of their mounts'. This is for those who install 'Takillu' (with Nasb) via 'Hatta' or hidden 'An'.\nWhoever raises 'Takillu': The sentence is not genitive in place, but coordinated with 'Saraytu', as if saying: 'I traveled with them until their mounts became weary'. It is a reported State (Hal) after its occurrence time; so estimated as past tense. 'Ma yuqadna': Sentence in place of Raf' (Nominative) as predicate of 'Al-Jiyad' (subject).\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'He threw the scroll so he might lighten his saddle ... And the provisions, even his sandals he threw them'\nThis verse: People attribute it to Al-Mutalammis, but it is not in his Diwan. It is by Ibn Marwan an-Nahwi, said regarding the story of Al-Mutalammis when he fled from Amr bin Hind. After it:\n'He went thinking the courier of Amr was behind him ... In fear, and he left his land and hated it'\nHe said 'He left his land and hated it' because Al-Mutalammis said:\n'She yearned for the farthest palm tree, so I said to her ... Basl (forbidden) upon you, are not those calamities?'\n'My mother is Levantine, since we have no Iraq ... A people we love while our people are grim'\n'You will not walk the paths of Al-Bubah heading to Najd ... As long as Amr lives nor as long as Qabus lives'\nAl-Mutalammis had mocked Amr bin Hind. Tarafa also mocked him. This reached Amr bin Hind, who didn't show anger. Then they praised him. He wrote a letter for each to his governor in Al-Hira, ordering their killing. He misled them that it was a gift. Al-Mutalammis said to Tarafa: 'We both mocked the King. If he wanted to give to us, he would, without writing to Al-Hira. Come let us check the letters. If good, we enter; if bad, we flee!' Tarafa refused. Al-Mutalammis swore to open his. He found a boy who read it: 'Woe to Al-Mutalammis's mother!' He told Tarafa: 'Open yours, it's the same!' Tarafa said: 'He wouldn't dare against me to anger my people!' Al-Mutalammis threw his scroll in the river and fled to Syria. He said:\n'I threw it at the bend by the side of Kafir ... Thus I acquire every misleading cat (decree)'\n'I accepted the water for it when I saw it ... The current shifting it in every stream'\nTarafa went and was killed. Al-Mutalammis escaped.\nWhoever narrates: 'Hatta na'luhu' (Raf'), the Ha in 'Alqaha' returns to the sandal only. Whoever installs or lowers 'Na'l', the pronoun can return to the sandal or the scroll.",

From the tribe, and storms intensified upon it'\nMeaning: A traveler in Arab lands outside sacred months, without a protector, is robbed or killed. He would seek protection from a tribe leader.\n'Al-Muhalafah': Contracting and reconciliation. 'Tal'ah': Low place, or high place. Tarafa's verse allows both:\n'I am not one to settle in the valleys/hills out of fear ...

Answer to 'Law' deleted: 'I would not leave'.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'So a group of the people said when I implored them ... Yes, and a group [said]: By the oath of Allah (Laymunu Allah), we do not know'\nThis verse: By Nusayb. He was a black slave from Wadi al-Qura, bought his freedom writing, praised Abd al-Aziz bin Marwan who bought his loyalty. Kunya: Abu Mihjan. Nusayb: Transferred name. Diminutive of 'Nusb' (sacrificial stone) or 'Nasb' (fatigue). Abu Bakr bin Duraid narrated: I met Nusayb and asked: Why named Nusayb? He said: I was born to a family in Waddan, my master said: 'Bring him to look at him'. He said: 'He is erected in creation (Munsab)', so I was named Nusayb. Then Abd al-Aziz bought and freed me.

    "text": "It is also narrated: 'He threw the *Hashiya* (cushion/saddle pad),' which is what the rider rides upon. Whoever narrates: 'Until his *Na'l* (sandal/horseshoe)' in the nominative case (*Raf'*), then the pronoun 'ha' in 'alqaha' (he threw it) refers back to the *Na'l*, and nothing else. Whoever puts *Na'l* in the accusative (*Nasb*) or genitive (*Khafd*), it is permissible for the pronoun in 'alqaha' to refer to the *Na'l*, and it is permissible for it to refer to the *Sahifa* (page/writing), and there would be hysteron proteron (inversion of order) in the verse, as if he said: 'He threw the page—he threw it—so that he might lighten his saddle, and the provisions, even his sandals.' The *Rahl* (saddle) is for the she-camel what the *Sarj* (saddle) is for the horse. Abu al-Qasim recited in the chapter of Oaths: 'So oppose, for by God, you will not descend a *Tal'ah* (ravine/slope) ... of the earth, unless you are acquainted with humiliation.' This verse: A group attributes it to Muzahim al-Uqayli, but I did not find it in his collected poetry (Diwan). I suspect that the one who attributed it to him imagined it was from his poem that begins: 'Did a dwelling at Al-Arin excite you, which became desolate ... of the tribe, and upon which the storms intensified?' But this verse is not from that poem, nor does it contain meaning befitting this verse! The meaning of this verse is: A traveler in the lands of the Arabs, outside of the sacred months, if he does not have a protector to grant him sanctuary, or a confederate to make a pact with, he would be robbed in every place, and perhaps killed. So a stranger would seek sanctuary with the master of the tribe, who would write for him on an arrow or something else: 'So-and-so is my neighbor (under my protection),' or someone would accompany him to travel with him until he left his jurisdiction, then he would seek sanctuary with the master of another tribe. He would continue to do this in every place he passed until he reached his own tribe. For this reason, Al-A'sha said regarding a man who went out during a sacred month, then the month was about to end while he had not reached his people, so he took refuge with a man who granted him sanctuary and protected him. Al-A'sha said to Al-Rifad: 'Before you, Al-Rifad fulfilled his duty to his neighbor ... so he saved him from what he feared and dreaded; He caught him at the unsheathing of the weapons after ... he had passed not a short distance, and had almost perished.' *Muhalafah* (Alliance): Making a pact and reconciliation. Its origin is that each of the two men swears to his companion that he will not betray him. The *Tal'ah* here: The low place in the ground, though it can also be the high place in the ground. The verse of Tarafa allows for both meanings, which is his saying: 'And I am not one to settle in the *Tila'* (ravines/hills) out of fear ... but when the people seek assistance, I assist.' It is also narrated 'Li-baytatin' (for a night). Whoever interprets *Tila'* in this verse as high places, its meaning is that he does not settle in high places for fear of being raided. This meaning is strengthened by the narration of the one who narrated 'Li-baytatin'. Whoever interprets it as low places, its meaning is: He does not settle in hidden places fleeing from guests seeking him; because the miser hides his location and shortens the height of his tent so strictly that he is not sought. This second meaning is supported by his saying: 'But when the people seek assistance, I assist.' And his saying: 'So no, by God, you descend' (*Fa-la wallahi tahbitu*), he meant: 'So no, by God, you will NOT descend.' He placed 'La' (no/not) in a position other than its [usual] place, just as Al-A'sha said: 'Old age settled its burdens upon him ... and old age did not beguile him, except with a beguiling.' He meant: 'And nothing but old age beguiled him with a beguiling.' It is possible that when he mentioned the first 'La', it sufficed him from repeating it a second time. And his saying: 'Min al-ard' (of the earth): If you make 'Min' connected to 'Tahbitu' (descend), it has no place [grammatically], because it connects to an explicit noun. If you make it connected to an omitted word, it has a place, which is in the position of an adjective for 'Tal'ah'. And his saying: 'Illa anta li-dhulli 'arifu' (Unless you are acquainted with humiliation): This is a sentence that has a grammatical place because it is in the position of a circumstantial accusative (*Hal*) from the pronoun in 'Tahbitu'. Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'By God, does there remain upon the days a *Dhu Hayad* (Ibex) ... in a *Mushmakhirr* (lofty place) containing *Zayyan* (wild jasmine) and myrtle?' This verse: It is narrated for Malik bin Khalid al-Khuna'i, as stated in the Book of Sibawayh. Abu Ja'far Ahmad bin Ubayd said: Abu Nasr recited this poetry to me for Abu Dhu'ayb al-Hudhali. He said: And Abu Amr narrates this poetry for Al-Fadl bin Abbas Utbah bin Abi Lahab. It is narrated: 'Tallahi' and 'Lillahi' (By God/For God), and both are oaths containing the meaning of wonder. By 'Dhu Hayad', he means the Ibex (*Wa'l*). *Hayad* means dodging and fleeing. This is how Abu al-Abbas Muhammad bin Yazid narrated it. It is also narrated 'Dhu Hiyad' with a Kasra on the Ha, and he said: It is the plural of *Haydah*, like *Haydah* and *Hid* (menstruation). This is how Abu Sa'id al-Sukkari narrated it in the poems of the Hudhalis. It is said: It is a crookedness in the horn of the Ibex. *Mushmakhirr*: The high mountain. *Zayyan*: Wild jasmine. *As*: Myrtle. It is said *As*: Traces of bees when they pass and drops of honey fall from them; Al-Shaybani narrated this. It is said: Bee droppings on stone. It is said: The remains of ashes on the tripod stones (*Athafi*). The author of Kitab al-Ayn said: *As* is a type of honey.

    "text": "And the 'Ba' (in/with) in his saying: 'bihi al-zayyanu' (in it is wild jasmine) also has a grammatical position, and it is in the position of an adjective for 'Mushmakhirr', as if he said: 'in which exists wild jasmine,' or 'in which is settled wild jasmine.' In this case, 'Al-Zayyan' is the agent (*Fa'il*) of the settling/existing. It is also permissible for 'Al-Zayyan' to be nominative due to being the subject (*Mubtada*), and 'bihi' is its predicate (*Khabar*); so the 'Ba' in this case would be in the position of nominative, while in the first case it was in the position of genitive (*Khafd*), and in both cases, it connects to an omitted word. His saying: 'Ala al-ayyam' (upon the days) is in the position of a circumstantial accusative (*Hal*) from 'Dhu Hayad'; meaning: 'A Dhu Hayad (Ibex) does not remain while the days succeed each other upon it.' He meant: 'Upon the succession of days,' or 'Upon the passing of days,' so he omitted the possessed noun (*Mudaf*) and placed the possessor (*Mudaf ilayhi*) in its stead. Before this verse is: 'O Mayya, if you lose a people to whom you gave birth ... or if you are bereft of them, for indeed Time is a snatcher. Amr and Abd Manaf, my two parents whom I knew ... in the belly of Mecca, refusing injustice, frowning [fierce].' It is also narrated: 'In the belly of Ar'ar.' This is how Abu Sa'id al-Sirafi and Abu Ali al-Farisi narrated it. Abu al-Qasim recited regarding this verse: 'So I said, The oath of God, I will not leave sitting ... even if they cut off my head in your presence and my limbs.' This verse: Is from the famous poetry of Imru' al-Qays, and we have mentioned his name and agnomen previously. *Awsal*: Limbs, singular is *Wasl*. The meaning of *Ladayk*: With/at you. *Abrah*: To cease/leave (used with negative to mean 'remain'). The answer to 'Law' (even if) is omitted because what preceded it suffices for it, as if he said: 'Even if they cut off my head, I would not leave!' Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'So a group of the people said when I adjured them ... 'Yes,' and a group said, 'By the oath of God, we do not know.'' This verse: Belongs to Nusayb. He was a black slave belonging to a man from the people of Wadi al-Qura. He entered a contract of manumission (*Kitabah*) for himself, praised Abd al-Aziz bin Marwan, who then bought his loyalty (patronage). His agnomen (*Kunya*): Abu Mihjan. Ibn Qutaybah claimed his agnomen was: Abu al-Hajna, and recited a verse by Kuthayyir satirizing him: 'I saw Abu al-Hajna passing among the people ... and the color of Abu al-Hajna is the color of beasts. You see him, despite the blackness that has loomed over him ... even if he is oppressed, having the face of an oppressor.' Nusayb is a transferred name. It is possible that it is the diminutive of *Nusub*, which is a stone upon which they used to slaughter what they sacrificed to idols. God Almighty said: '...and what has been slaughtered upon the *Nusub*.' It is possible it is the diminutive of *Nasab*, which is fatigue, or the diminutive of *Nasab* (with Fatha on Nun and Sukun on Sad)—which is what is set up—so he worshipped other than God. God Almighty said: 'As if they were hastening to a *Nusub*.' It is possible it is the diminutive of *Nisab*, or *Nasib*, being a diminutive of trimmings (*Tarkhim*). Al-Isfahani narrated with a chain of transmission from Abu Bakr bin Durayd, who said: I met Nusayb one day at the gate of Hisham bin Abd al-Malik, so I said to him: 'O Abu Mihjan, why were you named Nusayb? Is it because of your saying in your poetry: 'The fatigue (*Nusub*) appeared to her'?!' He said: 'No, but I was born among a household in Waddan, and my master said: 'Bring him to us so we may look at him.' He said: 'He is erected/upright (*Munsab*) in creation.' So I was named Al-Nusub, then Abd al-Aziz bin Marwan bought me and freed me.' This report implies that it is the diminutive of: *Munsab*, which is the one overlooking in straightness, and it was trimmed by removing its extra letters, just as if you made the diminutive of Muhammad and trimmed it, you would say: Humayd. As for *Al-Mihjan*: It is a stick with a hooked end, called *Al-Qasqasah*, and the common people mispronounced it and said: *Al-Kaskasah*. *Al-Hajnah*: Feminine of *Ahjan*, and the plural of *Ahjan* is *Hujn*. Al-Nabigha said: 'Hooks (*Hujn*) on towering ropes ... extended by hands pulling toward you.' It is the bent and crooked. The poem containing this verse is among his finest poetry, which says: 'Ho, O Eagle of the nest, the nest of Dariyyah ... may you be watered by the morning clouds, concerning an eagle and a nest. Nights and months pass, and I do not see ... the passing of nights making me forget the daughter of Amr. She says: Connect with us or abandon us, and she may see ... that if she abandons, there is no connection with abandonment. So I was not pleased with what she said, nor did I show anger ... and my chest became tight with what I concealed of her love. I remained in Dhu Waddan reciting to my young she-camel ... while I had upon her neither a young camel nor a virgin camel. And I do not adjure the shepherds except as a distraction ... regarding the one with clear canine teeth and pleasant scent. So the shepherds said to me: 'Why do you not mix with us?' ... I said: 'Yes (I will), for I have been thinking of her!' And mention was made to me of one sorrowful, familiar with ... the young camels of Adiy, or the young camels of Banu Wabr. So a group of the people said when I adjured them: ... 'Yes,' and a group said, 'By the oath of God, we do not know.'",

She sent a woman to guide him blindfolded at night. He touched the tent with henna to mark it. Next day he found the tent. She sent him money to keep quiet. He refused unless she accepted his gift. She did. He said:\n'And how many a slain one for whom no blood money is paid ...

Meaning: You passed the danger zone.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'So Ka'b bin Mama and Ibn Su'da are not ... More generous than you, O Umar the Generous'\nThis verse: By Jarir praising Umar bin Abd al-Aziz. Ka'b bin Mama: Pre-Islamic Arab famous for generosity (died of thirst giving his water to others).",

    "text": "'They throw down the person of intellect until there is no movement in him... And they are the weakest of God's creation in person'\n\n'Al-Ghabit' (The Envier/Wisher): Is like the 'Hasid' (Envier), except that the 'Ghabit' is one who wishes to have the like of what another has, without wishing for the blessing to be removed from the envied person. The 'Hasid' (Malicious Envier) is one who wishes for the blessing to be removed from the envied person, even if he himself does not obtain it, like the action of Iblis - may Allah curse him - with Adam, peace be upon him. He says: Many a man thinks we obtain from you what we desire, and that you grant us from your connection what we hope for, so he envies ('Ghibta') us for that; yet if he sought your connection as we seek it, he would not obtain anything of what he desires!\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Examples Acting like the Active Participle:\n'Striking (Darubun) with the sword blade the shanks of their fat ones... If they lacked provisions, for indeed you are a slaughterer'\n\nThis verse is by Abu Talib - the uncle of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace - from a poem mourning Abu Umayya bin al-Mughira bin Abdullah bin Umar bin Makhzum. He was his son-in-law. He went out as a merchant to the Levant (Sham) and died at a place called Sur and Suhaym. Abu Talib said mourning him:\n'Is not the Provision of the Rider (Zad ar-Rakb) undefended... At Sur and Suhaym, the graves have hidden him?'\n'At Sur and Suhaym is a familiar and accepted one... And a knight of raids, a speaker, and a gamesman (Yasir)'\n'They called out that the Master of the Tribe is not among them... And the two tribes, Ka'b and Amir, were bereaved'\n'And he used to, when coming from the Levant returning... The glad tidings would run to us at his arrival'\n'So the People of Allah (Quraysh) become white (joyful) as if... Raydah and Ma'afir clothed them in silk (Hibir)'\n'You see his house, never ceasing by it... Felled huge camels (Muja'ja'ah) and herds of cattle'\n'If they are eaten one day, the next day brings the like of them... Fat ones (Zawahiq) or heavy pregnant camels (Bahazir)'\n'Striking (Darub) with the sword blade the shanks of their fat ones... If they lacked provisions, for indeed you are a slaughterer'\n'And if there is no fresh meat (Gharid), then indeed... The sacks are poured upon their mouths'\n'O for you as a mourner, you greeted with a tool... Pointed (Shura'iyyah), from which fingernails turn yellow'\n\n'Nasl as-Sayf': Its blade. Therefore, he added it to the sword. Sometimes the whole sword is called 'Nasl'. He praised him for hamstringing camels for guests when provisions were scarce. 'Sur wa Suhaym': Upper parts of it. 'Al-Yasir': One who plays *Maysir* (gambling for charity). 'Al-Qafil': The one returning from travel. 'Al-Basha'ir': Plural of 'Bishara' (Good news). He meant by 'Ahl Allah' (People of Allah): Quraysh; the Arabs used to call them the People of Allah because they were the caretakers of the religion. 'Al-Hibir': Soft garments made in Yemen. 'Raydah': A town mentioned by Tarafa in his saying: 'And at the foot of the mountain are signs as if their traces... Are Yemeni woven in Raydah and Sahul'. He meant the people of Raydah. 'Ma'afir': A tribe from Yemen. 'Al-Muja'ja'ah': Thrown down/Felled. 'Al-Kum': Camels with large humps. 'Al-Baqir': A name for a herd of cows. 'Az-Zawahiq': The fat ones. 'Az-Zuhm': Those with much fat, singular 'Zahim'. Zuhair said: 'Leading horses with injured hooves... Among them are the lean and the fat (Zahim)'. 'Al-Makhad': Pregnant camels, singular 'Khalifah' (from a different root). 'Al-Gharid': Fresh/Tender. Meaning of 'Takubbu': Pour. 'Al-Ghara'ir': Sacks, plural of 'Ghararah'. 'An-Na'i': The one who announces a person's death. 'Al-Alah': The tool/weapon. 'Ash-Shura'iyyah': That which is aimed for stabbing, i.e., directed.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Cautious (Hadhirun) of matters that do not harm, and safe... From what will not save him from the decrees'\n\nThis verse: Is fabricated, not Arabic. There is disagreement about its fabricator. Some claimed it is by Ibn al-Muqaffa. Al-Mazini recounted: 'Abu Yahya al-Lahiqi told me: Sibawayh asked me about a verb: Is it transitive? So I fabricated this verse for him.' Because of this, this verse was rejected against Sibawayh! We have found in the poetry of Zayd al-Khayl at-Ta'i another verse against which there is no objection, which is his saying:\n'Did I not inform you of news that came to me... Abu al-Kusah, the threat was serious'\n'It came to me that they are tearing my honor... The donkeys of the two Karmals, having a noise'\n\nAs for the meaning of the verse, it allows two interpretations: First: That he describes a human with ignorance and lack of knowledge, placing matters in wrong places, feeling safe from what should not be trusted, and fearing what should not be feared!...",

    "text": "The second interpretation - which is more likely to me -: Is that he meant that man is ignorant of the consequences of matters; he plans, but analogical reasoning and planning betray him. Thus it is like the Almighty's saying: 'But perhaps you hate a thing and Allah makes therein much good,' and 'But perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you.' And like the saying of Abu al-Atahiya:\n'And a person may perish from the direction of his safety... And be saved by Allah's permission from where he fears'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Then they increased [in praise] that they are in their people... Forgiving (Ghufurun), their sin is not boasting'\n\nThis verse is from the famous poetry of Tarafa. It is narrated: 'Fujurun' (Wicked/Lying) with Jim, which is the plural of 'Fujur', meaning one who is very immoral, or very lying, for it is said: 'Fajara ar-rajulu' if he lied. It is narrated that a Bedouin came to Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: 'My she-camel has sores and sores on its back, so give me a mount!' Umar said: 'By Allah, your she-camel has no sores or back sores!' The Bedouin said:\n'Abu Hafs Umar swore by Allah... That she has no sores or back sores'\n'Forgive him, O Allah, if he lied (Fajara)!'\nUmar said: 'O Allah, forgive me!' Then he gave him a mount!!\nIt is narrated: 'Ghayru fakhur' with a dotted Kha (boasting). Its meaning: They do not boast of their honor, nor are they impressed with themselves, but they are humble to people, as the other said:\n'Do you not see a people other than us, the best of their people... Boast less against their people than us?'\n'And pride does not deter us against them... When they speak to us, from speaking to them gently'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of the Adjective Resembling the Active Participle:\n'Lank of belly (Lahiqu batnin), fat of the loin'\n\nThis verse is by Humayd al-Arqat. Humayd: Is a transferred name. It is possible it is a truncated diminutive of Ahmad, Hamid, Mahmud, Humayda', or Hamdan; for all these names, if diminutized and truncated, return to Humayd. Al-Arqat: Similar to Al-Abrash (speckled). He described a wild donkey. Some who discussed the verses of Al-Jumal claimed he described a horse, which is a mistake. The evidence that he described a wild donkey is his saying before it:\n'Lean-waisted (Aqabba), overlooking the depressions... White-flanked (Ahqab), braying, driver of herds'\n'Al-Aqabb': Lean at the waists. 'Al-Mifa'': Overlooking. The verb is 'Awfa'. The quadriliteral verb does not form 'Mif'al' (instrument/intensive noun); 'Mif'al' is only formed from the triliteral. However, it came by deleting the addition, just as they said 'Mahawin' (plural of Mihwan), meaning a very giving man, from 'Ahana' (to give/despise wealth). Al-Kumayt said:\n'High-nosed, despisers (Mahawin) of the bodies of slaughter camels... Empty-bellied in the evenings, not weak nor stingy'\nSo 'Mahawin' is plural of 'Mihwan', which is from 'Ahana'. 'Ar-Ruzun': Low places where water gathers. 'Al-Ahqab': One with whiteness on his croup, the place of the saddlebag. Meaning of 'Lahiqu batnin': His belly is lean so it joined his back, as Imru' al-Qays said:\n'The starving of the run folded him, so the belly is lean... Raised to the two loins, so it is empty'\n'Ash-Shahhaj': The intensely braying (Shahij is the sound). 'Al-Mishall': One who drives away a lot; 'Ash-Shall' is driving away. 'Al-'Un': Groups of wild donkeys, singular 'Anah'. 'Al-Qara': The back.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Wonder (Ta'ajjub):\n'If men wintered and their eating intensified... Then you are the whitest of them in a cook's shirt'\n\nThis verse is by Tarafa bin al-Abd, in a poem mocking Amr bin Hind. Al-Farra' recited it from Al-Kisa'i:\n'As for kings, you are today the meanest of them... In meanness, and the whitest of them in a cook's shirt'\nAbu Muhammad bin Rustam recited in Tarafa's poetry from Yaqub, mocking Amr bin Hind:\n'O father of the Jaramiq, do you hope that... O son of the crushed one, estates among rocks will submit to you?'\n'You are the son of Hind, so inform who is your father then... The kingdom is not fit except for every proud one'\n'If you say Nasr, then Nasr was the worst youth... Of old, and the whitest of them in a cook's shirt'\n'You have no shade or leaves in the heights... And in disgrace you have roots upon roots'\n'If glory is divided, it stops short of your nobles... Or if meanness is divided, you are preferred with Sheikhs'\n'Al-Jaramiq': The Nabataeans, a people of the non-Arabs. 'Ash-Shadikh': One whose head is crushed. 'Ad-Diba'': A type of predator, crooked in creation; he likened his clan to them in stupidity, for the hyena is described with stupidity. It is nominative by 'Tarju'. 'Al-Ajyakh': Rocks - according to At-Tusi. 'Al-Baddhakh': One who boasts much of his fathers and deeds.",

    "text": "'Al-Asnakh': Plural of 'Sinkh', which is the root of everything. Meaning of 'Akda': Fell short and decreased in this place, though in another place it means increased; it is of the auto-antonyms (Addad). 'Sarat al-Qawm': Their nobles. The meaning of 'whiteness of a cook's shirt': That he cooks little, so his shirt is clean with no blackness on it. It is the opposite of Miskin ad-Darimi's saying:\n'As if the pots of my people every day... Are Turkish domes covered with cloths'\n'As if those kindling fire for them are camels... Painted with tar, and the tar is coating'\n'In their hands are ladles of iron... Resembling the bucket of the water-wheels'\n'Al-Faqirah': The well into which water flows from another.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'A girl in her flowing (Fadfad) shift... Whiter than the sister of Banu Ibad'\n\nThis poetry: I do not know its author. I found Ibn al-A'rabi recited it in his Nawadir:\n'Oh, would that I were like you in whiteness... Whiter than the sister of Banu Ibad'\n'A girl in the past Ramadan... Cutting off the conversation with flashing (Iymad)'\nHe explained 'Cutting off the conversation with flashing' saying: If she flashed [a smile], they left their conversation and looked at her due to her beauty! His saying 'In the past Ramadan': The spring gathered them at that time. 'Al-Iymad': What appears of the whiteness of her teeth when laughing and smiling. It is likened to the flash of lightning. Dhu al-Rumma clarified this by saying:\n'And she smiles the flash of lightning from a distinct mouth... Like the color of chamomile, watered by rain'\nAnother said:\n'The flash of lightning was between me and her... When her smiling appeared from between the houses'\nOthers besides Ibn al-A'rabi added:\n'Like the gazelle adorned with jewelry (Khadad)... Lean-bellied (Qabba'), having a fleshy (Radrad) rump'\n'Dir' al-Mar'ah': Her shift. 'Al-Fadfad': The long, full one. 'Banu Ibad': A people (Christians of Al-Hira, known for fair skin). 'Al-Khadad': A small amount of jewelry, or a type of it. The poet said:\n'And if she shone from the edge of the curtain without jewelry... You would say: A gazelle with no Khadad on it'\n'Al-Qabba'': Lean-bellied. 'Ar-Radrad': Fleshy.\n\nAbu al-Qasim - may Allah have mercy on him - recited in the Chapter of Habbadha:\n'Oh, how lovely (Habbadha) is Mount Rayyan as a mountain... And how lovely is the dweller of Rayyan, whoever it was (Min kana)'\n\nThis verse is by Jarir bin al-Khatafi. We mentioned the derivation of his name previously in the book. It is from a poem mocking Al-Akhtal. After this verse:\n'And how lovely are breezes from a southern wind... Coming to you from the direction of Rayyan sometimes'\n'A south wind blew with my remembrance; I did not mention you... At the rock east of Hawran'\nHis saying 'Ya Habbadha': 'Ya' could be a vocative, and the addressed is deleted, as if he said: 'O people, lovely is Mount Rayyan'. It could be an opening particle of speech, which is Al-Asma'i's view. Similar to the Rajaz poet:\n'O (Ya) curse of Allah upon the people of Ar-Raqam... People of the large herd, donkeys, and nose-rings'\nHis saying 'Min jabalin': In the place of accusative as Specification (Tamyiz). The operator in it is the preceding sentence, as the other said:\n'O horseman, what a horseman you are... Trodding the sides, wide of arm span'\nAs if he said: It is beloved to me among mountains, or I single it out for my love among mountains. Al-Kisa'i and Al-Farra' said this. 'Nafahat': Plural of 'Nafhah', from saying: 'Nafahat ar-rih' if it blew. He means by 'Al-Yamaniyah': The South Wind; because it blows from the direction of Yemen. He clarified that saying: 'Habbat januban'. Sibawayh recited: 'Habbat januban fa-dhikra ma dhakartukum', meaning: I remembered you a remembrance??! 'Ma' is extra. 'Hawran': A mountain. 'Min' is in the place of accusative as the predicate of 'Kana', and its noun is hidden in it; as if he said: Whoever it was?\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Subjects and Objects where each acts upon the other:\n'But fairness (Nisfan) - if I insulted and they insulted me - ... Are the sons of Abd Shams from Manaf and Hashim'\n\nThis verse is by Al-Farazdaq, from a poem mocking Jarir bin al-Khatafi. Before it:\n'And it is forbidden that I insult Muqa'is... With my fathers, the high-nosed, the noble, the generous (Khadarim)'\n'But fairness - if I insulted and they insulted me - ... Are the sons of Abd Shams from Manaf and Hashim'\n'Those are my fathers, so bring me the like of them... And I disdain/hate ('Abdu) that Kulayb be mocked by Darim'",

    "text": "'Ash-Shumm': Plural of 'Ashamm', which is one having straightness and elevation in the nasal bone. This is praiseworthy. It is also used to mean might and pride. It is borrowed from the she-camel that sniffs the stuffed skin of her dead calf (baww) but does not accept it. This is used as a proverb. Abu Tammam at-Ta'i mentioned it saying:\n'Of the Rudayni spears which, when they shake... Sniff the stuffed skin of the small-nosed one possessing pride (Shamam)'\n'Al-Khadarim': The generous nobles, likened to oceans. It is said 'Bahr Khadram' if it has much water. 'An-Nisf': Fairness/Justice. He says: It is not fair that I exchange insults with one who is below me in lineage and majesty of position; fairness is only that I exchange insults with one who is my equal! Meaning of 'A'badu': I disdain and hate. It is said: 'Abidtu min ash-shay'i a'badu 'abadan' if I disdained it and got angry. From it is the Almighty's saying: 'Say, if the Most Merciful had a son, then I would be the first of worshippers (Abidin)' meaning: The disdainers.\nHis saying: 'Law sababtu wa sabbani': A sentence in the place of the predicate of 'Lakinna', carried on the meaning; as if he said: 'But fairness is that I insult Banu Abd Shams.' 'Hashim': Coordinated with 'Abd Shams', not 'Manaf', because Abd Shams and Hashim are brothers, their father is Abd Manaf. Al-Farazdaq clarified this in a poem praising Hisham bin Abd al-Malik:\n'You inherited the clothes of glory, so they are your attire... From the two sons of Manaf: Abd Shams and Hashim'\nHe said in another poem:\n'And if asked who is our equal, the sun would point... To the two sons of Manaf: Abd Shams and Hashim'\n\nAs for Al-Farazdaq's claim of refraining from mocking those below him; this is a path not agreed upon. The Arabs have three schools in this:\nSome call him 'The Lowly' (Al-Khasis) and honor themselves from replying to him, as narrated about Bashar bin Burd. A rogue stood before him while Bashar was reciting and said: 'Cover your poetry as you cover your private parts!' Bashar clapped his hands, got angry, and said: 'Who are you, woe to you?!' He said: 'I am a man from Bahila; my maternal uncles are Salul, my in-laws are Ukl, my name is Kalb (Dog), my father's name is Qird (Monkey), my birthplace is Adah, and my home is Nahr Bilal!' Bashar laughed and said: 'Go, woe to you, for you are noble in your meanness. God knows you have screened yourself from me with fortresses of iron!' Similar to this is the other's saying:\n'Your honor saved you, the safety of the fly... Its measures protected it from being reached'\nAnother said:\n'The slave of Banu Misma' made me hear [insults]... So I protected my soul and honor from him'\n'I did not answer him due to my contempt for him... And who bites the dog if it bites?!'\n\nSome of them: If the lowly one mocked him, he mocked the best of his tribe, as the other said:\n'Indeed, if the dog of the tribe barks at me, I say to it... Peace [goodbye], while your Lord is strangled by the rope'\n\nSome of them: Mock everyone who mocks them, whether noble or lowly. Al-Farazdaq followed this path, contradicting what he said in this poem! Abu Tammam said:\n'He hoped the lowness of his rank would save him... And he did not know that the lion preys on the dog'\n\nAbu al-Qasim - may Allah have mercy on him - recited in this Chapter:\n'And bays (Kumtan) bloodied, as if their saddle-cloths... Flowed over them, and they were clad in a gilded color'\n\nThis verse is by Tufayl bin Awf bin Dabis al-Ghanawi. Kunya: Abu Quran. He was called 'Muhabbar' (Beautified). There is disagreement on why he was named so. Abu Ubayd said: Named so for his beautiful description of horses. Ibn Qutayba said: Named so for the beauty of his poetry, and Abu Ubayd said the same. As-Suli said: Named so for his saying describing a garment:\n'Its upper part is rags of a beautified (Muhabbar) garment... And its back is from a bound Athami fabric'\nThe most correct of these opinions: He was named so for the beauty of his poetry. It is narrated that Muawiyah said: 'Leave Tufayl for me, and the rest of the poets are for you!!'\nTufayl is of the transferred names. Possible to be diminutive of 'Tifl' - with open Ta - which is the soft and tender; it is said 'Baz Tifl'. Possible to be diminutive of 'Tif'l' - with kasra on Ta - which is a homonym with different meanings. 'At-Tif'l': The young of humans and others. People disagreed on Zuhair bin Abi Sulma's saying:\n'I will travel in the dawn then journey continuously... Until night unless a Tif'l diverts me'\nSome said: The foal of the she-camel, i.e., unless my camel gives birth, so I stop for her. It is said: He meant by Tif'l the spark that falls from the fire-stick when striking fire, i.e., unless I strike fire and stop. Dhu al-Rumma said describing a spark falling from the fire-stick:\n'When it appeared, I shrouded it while it was a Tiflah (spark)... Small, not completing an arm nor a span'\nIt is narrated: 'While it was alive (Hayyah)'.",

    "text": "Some said: He meant by 'Tif'l': The yellowing of the sun and its inclination to set. The most famous pronunciation for this is 'Tafal' with fatha on Ta and Fa. Ibn Qutayba said: 'At-Tif'l' is a prayer they used to pray at sunset. Awf and Dabis: Transferred names. 'Al-Awf': A plant. An-Nabigha said:\n'And it grew hawdhan and awf in bloom... I will gift him from the best of what a sayer said'\nThe locust is called 'Umm Awf'. The poet said:\n'What is a yellow one nicknamed Umm Awf... As if her two legs are two sickles'\nThe male organ is called 'Awf', and the female organ 'Sharij'. It is said to the married one: 'Ni'ma awfuka!' (Excellent is your Awf!). The poet said:\n'If Awf enters into Sharij... Openly, then the dowry becomes obligatory'\n'Ad-Dabis' among men: The ill-natured.\nAbu Ubayda Ma'mar bin al-Muthanna mentioned in the Book of Dibajah that 'Al-Kumayt' (Bay) among horses is between 'Al-Ahwa' (Black-brown) and 'Al-Asda'' (Rusty). It is closer to black than 'Ash-Shaqar' (Chestnut) and 'Al-Ward' (Dun), and more red than 'Ash-Shaqar al-Ward'. The female is also 'Kumayt'. He divided it into eight sections: Kumayt Ahamm, Kumayt Asham, Kumayt Mudamma, Kumayt Ahmar, Kumayt Mudhahhab, Kumayt Muhallif, Kumayt Aklaf, and Kumayt Asda'.\n'Al-Kumayt al-Ahamm': Resembles 'Al-Ahwa'. 'Al-Ahwa' is less black than 'Al-Jawn'. 'Al-Kumayt al-Ahamm' is distinguished from 'Al-Kumayt al-Ahwa' by the redness of his flanks and elbows. 'Al-Kumayt al-Asham' has more visible redness in his back than 'Al-Ahamm', but his redness is not pure. 'Al-Kumayt al-Mudamma': Whose back hair is red, intensely red, and the lower the redness goes to his elbows, the more it increases. 'Al-Kumayt al-Ahmar': More intensely red than 'Al-Mudamma'. 'Al-Kumayt al-Mudhahhab': Whose redness is mixed with yellowness. 'Al-Kumayt al-Muhallif': That causes swearing (dispute); observers differ on it, some say Chestnut, some Dun, some Bay. He said: The sign of 'Al-Muhallif' is between 'Al-Ashab' and 'Al-Ahmar'. The poet said:\n'A Kumayt not causing dispute, but... Like the color of pure red dye applied to leather'\n'Al-Kumayt al-Aklaf': Whose redness is not pure, and blackness is seen at the tips of his hair. 'Al-Kumayt al-Asda'': Which has 'Sad'ah', i.e., turbidity, and it covers every color of horses except blackness (Duhma), and has a little yellowness. They likened it to the color of iron rust. Abu Ubayda said: If the yellowness is free of turbidity, and there is no redness of 'Kalf', it is 'Afrah'.\n'Kumayt' is one of the diminutive names that have no non-diminutive form. It is a truncated diminutive of 'Akmat', like 'Humayd' from 'Ahmad', except that 'Akmat' was not used. Evidence is their pluralizing it as 'Kumt'. Sibawayh said: I asked Al-Khalil - may Allah have mercy on them - about 'Kumayt'? He said: It is like 'Jamil' and 'Humayr'. It is a redness mixed with blackness, not pure. They diminutized it because it is between black and red, not purely called black nor red, but close to them. It is like saying: It is a little below that.\n'Al-Mutun': The backs. Meaning of 'Istash'arat': Wore it as a 'Shi'ar' (undergarment). 'Ash-Shi'ar': What touches the body. 'Ad-Dithar': What is over it. 'Kumtan' is accusative because it is coordinated with his saying before it:\n'We milked from Al-A'raf, the manes of Bisha... And the manes of Lubna, the horses, oh how far the milking place!'\n'Daughters of Al-Urrab, and Al-Wajih, and Lahiq... And A'waj Yataami resembling Al-Mutanassib'\n'Bays and blacks (Wuwan), high represent their hip bones... Daughters of a stallion known as Majnab'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'He returned to the heart a lovesick (Amid) passion... And he was asked (Su'ila) - if only he would clarify to us - a question (Su'alan)'\n'And we might stay in it and see ages... In which the shy, plump women lead us'\n\nAbu al-Qasim mentioned these two verses for Umar bin Abi Rabi'ah, which is a mistake. They are for Al-Murrar al-Asadi, from Banu Faq'as, as in Sibawayh's book. I did not find them in his poetry collection. There are two Murrars: Asadi - Al-Murrar bin Sa'id, who used to exchange satire with Al-Musawir bin Hind. And Adawi - Al-Murrar bin Munqidh from Banu al-Adawiyah, who said:\n'Not lovely are you, O Sana'a, as a land... Nor Shu'ub, neither as a love of mine nor as revenge'\nAl-Murrar: Name transferred from adjectives. Likewise Sa'id and Munqidh. As for Faq'as: Improvised name, I know no derivation for it!\n'Al-Hawa al-Amid': That corrupts the liver. 'Ar-Rajul al-Amid': Whose liver love has corrupted. It is said: 'Al-Amid' is the sick person who cannot sit unless supported from his sides. The first view is supported by the poet's saying:\n'If they described me, then thin of body... Or if they searched me, then white of liver'\nAnother said:",

    "text": "'I wander in love for Da'd as long as I live, and if I die... Then oh my liver from what I met regarding Da'd!'\nThis is by An-Nimr bin Tawlab. His saying: 'Faradda 'ala al-fu'adi hawan 'amidan': He meant: He had forgotten, but when he looked at the dwelling of his beloved, his passion returned, as Bishr bin Abi Khazim said:\n'O my two friends, indeed the house is a relapse (Ghafr) for the lover... Just as the insane or the wounded relapses'\n'Al-Ghafr': Relapse of illness. Meaning of 'Naghna': We stay. 'Al-'Usur': Time/Ages. Meaning 'Yaqtadnana': Lead us as a beast is led. He used the verb form 'Ifta'ala' for exaggeration in leading; as said 'Kasaba' and 'Iktasaba'. 'Al-Khurud': Plural of 'Kharidah', the shy woman. It is said 'Takharadat al-mar'ah' if she became bashful. 'Al-Khidhal': Plural of 'Khadlah', one with fleshy calves. The verbs in the second verse: 'Nara' and 'Yaqtadnana'; he made the first operative ('Nara'), so he hid the pronoun in the second. If he had made the second operative, he would have deleted the pronoun and returned the verb to its origin, saying 'Yaqtaduna al-Khurudu al-Khidhalu'. The verse stands in meter with the operation of either verb. He connected it to the [previous] verse to show the rhymes are accusative and that he operated the first.\nIbn Durastawayh used to say: Whoever installs 'As-Su'ala' with 'Yubayyin' has erred, because the question is not clarified by the answerer, but by the questioner. He said: It is accusative by 'Su'ila' as its source, and the object of 'Yubayyin' is deleted, as if he said: 'And he was asked the question (Su'alan), if only he would clarify to us the answer!' It is narrated 'Su'alan' without Alif-Lam, which is closer to what Ibn Durastawayh said. Others said: It is not impossible to be accusative by 'Yubayyin' in two ways: First: Meaning 'Answer to the question', deleting the annexed noun. Second: Letting the question stand in place of what is asked about, as said: 'The Emir was beaten', and 'A garment woven in Yemen'. The verse of Ibn Abi Rabi'ah intended by Abu al-Qasim, which he mistook, is:\n'If she does not use the Siwak of Arak wood... She selects and uses the Siwak of Ishil wood'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of What is Allowed to Precede of Pronoun over Apparent Noun, and What is Not:\n'May his Lord reward Adi bin Hatim for me... The reward of howling dogs, and He has done so'\nThis verse: I do not know its author. Abu al-Qasim cited it as evidence for preceding the pronoun over the apparent noun by necessity. Some interpreted it: That the pronoun in 'Rabbuhu' returns to the 'Jaza'' (Reward) indicated by 'Jaza' (verb); as said: 'Who lies, it is bad for him'. 'Jaza'a al-kilabi al-'awiyati': Accusative as Source. Their reward: To be beaten and humiliated! Parallel to 'Wa qad fa'ala' is Al-Mutanabbi's saying:\n'And this is a prayer, if I were silent I would be sufficed... But I asked Allah regarding you, and He has done so'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Adding the Source to What Follows It:\n'Striking (Qar'u) the cups [against] the mouths of pitchers... Exhausted my old wealth and what I gathered of property (Nashab)'\nThis verse is by Al-Uqayshir al-Asadi. His name is: Al-Mughira bin Abdullah bin al-Aswad. Al-Mughira, Al-Aswad, and Al-Uqayshir are transferred descriptions/names. Al-Uqayshir used to get angry at this name. He passed by Banu Abs one day, and one said: 'O Uqayshir!' He looked at him angrily and said:\n'Do you call me Al-Uqayshir, that is my name... And I call you Son of the Lamp-Extinguisher'\n'She whispers to her lover at night secretly... And the Lord of mankind knows what she whispers!'\nSo he named that man: Son of the Lamp-Extinguisher, and that name remained in his descendants! He was famous for drinking and never sobering up. He said regarding that:\n'I say while the cup is in my hand turning it... Addressing the nobles, sons of Amalek'\n'Do not drink wine sipping... Except with the white-faced, sons of Patricians'\n'Striking the cups [against] the mouths of pitchers... Exhausted my old wealth and what I gathered of property'\n'As if they, while the hands of drinkers are working... When they shine in the hands of the youths (Gharaniq)'\n'Daughters of water [birds], their chests are sunken... Red are their beaks, yellow are the eye-sockets'\n'The hands of the cupbearers work them forever... As if their return is the return of handkerchiefs (Makhariq)'\n'That is pleasure, as long as no obscenity comes... Or you shoot in it with an arrow of fallen notch'\n'Stick to every youth, generous in his character... Pure of veins, noble, not mixed'\n'And do not accompany a mean person in whom is shame... And do not visit the owners of Dawanig (pennies)'\n'Ar-Rah': Wine, named so for the relief (Irtiyah) generated for its drinker. The poet said:\n'And I met what Ma'add [Arabs] met all of them... And I lost wine (Rahan) in youth and pride (Khali)'\nHe meant by 'Rah': Joy, and 'Khal': Pride. 'Al-Ghurr': Plural of 'Agharr', the white, handsome one. 'Al-Agharr' also: The famous one, likened to the horse with a blaze. 'Al-Batariq': The great ones of the Romans, singular 'Bitriq'. 'At-Tilad': Old wealth. 'An-Nashab': Name for estates and fixed assets one cannot travel with. 'Al-Qawaqiz': Vessels to drink from, singular 'Qaquzah' and 'Qazuzah'. The analogy for 'Qazuzah' is plural 'Qawaziz'. It is narrated 'Qaqizzah'. An-Nabigha al-Ja'di recited:\n'As if I drank with Kisra... He has a Qaquzzah and I have two'\n'Al-Gharaniq': Young men, singular 'Ghurnuq', 'Ghurnuq', 'Ghurniq', 'Ghurniq', 'Gharanq', 'Ghurunq'. The aquatic plant 'Gharaniq' is likened to them, as Abu al-Hindi said:\n'Pitchers will suffice Abu al-Hindi instead of the milk-skin of Salim... To which the grease of butter does not stick'\n'Presented, bouncing (Qazzan), as if their necks... Are necks of aquatic birds terrified by thunder'\n'Al-Fuwq' of the arrow: The place placed on the bowstring. If the notch falls, the arrow is ruined and useless; used as a proverb. 'Al-Maqrafah': Baseness of the father. 'Al-Qirfah': Suspicion. He meant by 'Ashab ad-Dawanig': The commoners. 'Ad-Dawanig': Plural of 'Dawnaq', a dialect of 'Daniq' (sixth of a dirham). He says: Do not drink with one whom a daniq pleases and its loss angers, but drink with the generous!\nSimilar to this is the other's saying:\n'If the commoner gets angry... A grain satisfies him!'\n'And taking a fals (penny) from his hand... Is like pulling a molar from his mouth'\n'And whoever becomes a slave of the fals... Tell me: How can he give?!'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'And they are standing (Wuquf) waiting for his decision... In an exposed distinct land (Dahin 'Adhatin), his command, while he is silent (Damiz)'\n\nThis verse is by Ash-Shammakh. His name is Ma'qil bin Dirar. Kunya: Abu Sa'id. Abu Bakr bin Duraid mentioned this and said he is one of the five one-eyed poets of Qays. All these names are transferred, not improvised. Al-Ma'qil: Fortress, or place of detention. Ad-Dirar: Source of 'Dharra', harming each other. Or plural of 'Darir', the bank of a river/valley. Aws bin Hajar said:\n'And no gulf from Al-Marut having branches... Throwing the bank (Darir) with wood of Talh and Dal'\nAs-Sa'id: Possessor of happiness. As-Sa'id: Small stream. Ash-Shammakh: One who holds his nose high (Yashmakhu) in pride. Ad-Dahi: Apparent/Exposed to sun. Al-'Adhah: Good land. Ad-Damiz: Silent closing his mouth. He described wild donkeys thirsty, needing water, waiting for their stallion to rise so they rise with him, while he is silent. Wild donkeys do not go to water by day fearing hunters; they wait for night. He said before this:\n'As if my saddle is upon a thick wild ass (Ja'b), driven... Away from the herd, the milk-less jennies (Jidad) emaciated him'\n'He folded their two thirsts in the heat of summer after... The stony lands flowed in the prime of the two Sirius stars'\n'So she remained at A'raf, as if her eyes... Towards the sun [asking]: Do drying wells approach [sunset]?'\n'Wuquf': Plural of 'Waqif', like 'Jalis/Julus'. It should have been 'Waqifat' if plural of 'Waqifah' (sound), or 'Awaqif' (broken). The origin is 'Wuwuqif', first Waw turned to Hamza to avoid two Waws, carrying broken plural on diminutive (diminutive of Waqifah is Uwayqifah). It seems Ash-Shammakh treated the singular as masculine on the dialect of those who carry adjectives of females on the meaning of lineage ('Imra'ah 'Ashiq', 'Naqah Damir'), so he pluralized as 'Wuquf'. Or carried masculinity on the meaning of 'Person' (Shakhs). Or because plural can be masculine/feminine.",

    "text": "And do not accompany a mean person in whom there is *Maqrafah* (ignobility) ... and do not visit the owners of *Dawaniq* (pennies/miserliness). *Al-Rah*: Wine. It was named *Rah* because of the *Irtiyah* (relief/joy) generated for its drinker. The poet said: 'And I encountered what all of Ma'add encountered ... and I lost *Rah* (joy) in youth and *Khal* (pride).' By *Rah*, he meant joy, and by *Khal*, pride. *Al-Ghurr*: Plural of *Agharr*, which is the beautiful white one. *Al-Agharr* is also the famous one among people, likened to the *Agharr* horse, which has a blaze (*Ghurrah*) on its forehead. *Al-Batariq*: The great ones of the Romans and their masters among them; the singular is *Bitriq* (Patrician). *Al-Tilad*: Old wealth/inheritance. *Al-Nashab*: A noun applied to estates and used items that a person cannot travel with. *Al-Qawaqiz*: Vessels to drink from; singular is *Qaquza* and *Qazuza*. By analogy, one who says *Qazuza* should say *Qawaziz* in the plural. *Qaqizah* is also narrated. He recited for Al-Nabigha al-Ja'di: 'As if I had caroused with Khosrow ... he had a *Qaquza* and I had two.' *Al-Gharaniq*: Young men; singular is *Ghurnuq*, *Ghurnuq*, *Ghurniq*, *Ghurniq*, *Gharaniq*, and *Ghurwaniq*. Water plants are *Gharaniq*, which resemble them (the young men), as Abu al-Hindi said: 'Pitchers to which the residue of butter did not cling ... will suffice Abu al-Hindi instead of the milk-skin of Salim. Covered with silk, as if their necks ... were the necks of water-daughters (*Banat al-Ma'* - aquatic birds/insects) frightened by thunder.' *Al-Fawq* - of the arrow: The place that sits on the bowstring. If the *Fawq* of the arrow breaks, it becomes ruined and useless; this is cited as a proverb. *Al-Maqrafah*: Baseness of the father. *Al-Qirfah*: Accusation and suspicion. By 'owners of *Dawaniq*', he meant the common rabble. *Dawaniq* is the plural of *Dawnaq*, which is a dialectal variant of *Daniq* - with opening or breaking of the Nun - which is one-sixth of a Dirham. He says: Do not carouse with one whom obtaining a Daniq pleases, and losing it angers, but carouse with the generous and noble! Similar to this is the saying of another: 'When the market-dweller gets angry ... a grain (small coin) pleases him! And stripping a fils (penny) from his hand ... is like stripping a molar from his mouth. And he who has become a slave to the fils ... tell me: how can he give?!' Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'And they are standing (*Wuquf*), waiting for his decree ... in a bright open land (*Dahin*), following his command, while he is silent (*Damiz*).' This verse: Belongs to Al-Shammakh. His name is Ma'qil bin Dirar, and his agnomen: Abu Sa'id. Abu Bakr bin Durayd narrated this and mentioned he is one of the five one-eyed poets from Qays. These names are all transferred, not improvised. As for *Al-Ma'qil*: It is the fortress, and it is also the place of detention. *Al-Dirar*: The verbal noun of 'Darra al-rajulu al-rajula' (The man harmed the man) if each harms the companion. It can also be the plural of *Darir*, which is the shore of the sea or the valley. Aws bin Hajar said: 'And no bay from the barren lands possessing branches ... throws the *Darir* (bank) with the wood of Talh and Dal trees.' *Al-Sa'id*: Possessor of happiness (*Sa'd*). *Al-Sa'id* (also): The small irrigation channel. *Al-Shammakh*: One who holds his nose high (*Yashmakhu*) above people, meaning he acts grandly over them and is arrogant. *Al-Dahi*: The exposed/apparent, and what protrudes from the earth to the sun. *Al-Adhah*: The noble/good earth. *Al-Damiz*: The silent one who has shut his mouth. He described wild donkeys (*Humur Wahsh*) that had become thirsty and needed to approach water, so they were waiting for their stallion to rise, so they would rise with his rising, while he was silent. Wild donkeys do not rise to approach water during the day for fear of the hunter; they wait for the approach of night. So he rises, and they rise with his rising. Likewise, he said before this verse: 'As if my saddle is upon a smooth-bodied wild donkey ... of the *Huqb* (white-bellied), whom the drying, scant-milking (years/conditions) have emaciated. He folded their two thirsts in the intense heat of summer after ... the rocky grounds flowed in the rein of the two Sirius stars. So they remained at high places (*A'raf*), as if their eyes ... were towards the sun (watching) whether receding water-wells would approach.' *Wuquf*: Plural of *Waqif* (standing), just as *Jalis* and *Julus* (sitting). It should have been said: 'And they are *Waqifat*' if the plural of *Waqifah* (standing female) were a sound plural, or: 'And they are *Awaqif*' if it were a broken plural. The original is *Wawaqif*, so the first Waw is changed to Hamza due to dislike of two Waws meeting, and to treat the broken plural like the diminutive. Do you not see that if you made the diminutive of *Waqifah*, you would have to say: *Uwayqifah*. It is as if Al-Shammakh mentioned the singular according to the dialect of those who carry feminine adjectives on the meaning of lineage/relation, saying 'Imra'ah Ashiq' (A lover woman) and 'Naqah Damir' (A lean she-camel). Therefore, he pluralized it as *Wuquf*, or he carried the masculine based on the meaning of the 'Person/Figure' (*Shakhs*). Or because the plural can be masculine or feminine.",

    "text": "Or it is possible he meant: 'And they are possessors of standing' (Dhawat wuquf), deleting the annexed noun, so 'Wuquf' is a source (Masdar) used in place of the active participle. This parallels their saying: 'Fulan 'Adl' (So-and-so is Justice). Or the estimation is: 'Dhu 'Adl', or 'Adl' meaning 'Adil'. Similar is Al-Khansa's saying:\n'She grazes as long as she grazes, until if she remembers... Then she is only advancing (Iqbal) and retreating (Idbar)'\nHis saying: 'Yantazirna qada'ahu': A sentence in the place of Hal (State) from the pronoun in 'Wuquf' or in the place of an adjective for 'Wuquf'. His saying: 'Wa huwa damizu': A sentence in the place of Hal as well. The Ba in 'Bi-dahin' means 'Fi' (In). The estimation: 'And they are standing in an exposed distinct land'. This is the meaning, but you should not carry it grammatically on this; because you would separate the connection and the connected, for what follows 'Al-Qada'' is part of the connection of the source, so it must be an adverb for 'Al-Qada'', not for 'Al-Wuquf'.\n'Al-Qatud': Wood of the saddle. 'Al-Ja'b': Thick donkey. 'Al-Mutarrad': Driven away by hunters from water. 'Lahathu': Changed him/Emaciated him. 'Al-Jidad': Jennies whose milk dried up, singular 'Jadud', likewise 'Al-Ghawariz'. 'Al-Huqb': Plural of 'Ahqab', having whiteness where the hind-girth goes. 'Az-Zhim'': Interval between drinks. 'Tawa Zhim'ayha': Made two drinking intervals into one; fear of going to water, intensifying thirst. 'Baydat al-Qayz': Height of summer heat. 'Ash-Shi'rayan': Two stars (Sirius and Procyon). 'Inanuhuma': Beginning of their heat. 'Al-Ama'iz': Stony places. 'A'raf': High place. 'Ar-Raki': Plural of 'Rakiyyah' (Well). 'An-Nawakiz': Whose water partly dried. He likened her eyes to them for their sunkenness from fatigue. 'Tadnu': Approaches setting. He says: She watches the sun setting to head towards water.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'The horses (Al-Mughira) knew that I... Caught up and did not recoil (Ankul) from striking a hearing (Masma'a)'\n\nThis verse is by Al-Murrar al-Asadi. 'Al-Mughira': The horses - said with kasra on Meem and damma. 'Ankul': Recoil and delay/be cowardly. Sibawayh recited this verse as evidence for the operation of the Source (Masdar) when it has Alif-Lam ('An ad-darbi masma'a'). Some grammarians do not allow the operation of the Source with Alif-Lam, and install 'Masma'an' by 'Lahiqtu', not by 'Ad-Darb'. Their argument is that Alif-Lam distances the Source from resembling the verb. Likewise, the active participle for them does not operate if it has Alif-Lam (in past meaning context usually, though general operator capability is debated), and they install what follows it by a hidden verb, or by resemblance to the object. It is narrated: 'Karartu fa-lam ankul', which is closer to being an argument for installing 'Masma'a' not by 'Ad-Darb', because if 'Karartu' (I returned/attacked) was transitive to it, he would have said: 'Ala masma'in'. It is permissible for one who denies this to argue that the poet deleted the preposition, as they said: 'Anba'tu Zaydan', meaning: 'An Zaydin', like the poet:\n'Amartuka al-khayra fa-if'al ma umirta bihi... Fa-qad taraktuka dha malin wa dha nashabi'\nAlthough Abu Ali al-Farisi reasoned this by saying: The preposition is not deleted if there is an alternative.\nAfter this verse:\n'And indeed I make the horses run, stumbling on spears... Protecting the solitary ally so he is defended'\n'And we brought the horses from the market of Himyar... Until we trod the land of Khath'am as strangers'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Defining the Number:\n'And does greeting bring back, or blindness remove ... The three tripod-stones (Thalathu al-Athafi), and the desolate traces?'\n\nThis verse is by Dhu al-Rumma. His name is: Ghaylan bin Uqba bin Buhaysh. Kunya: Abu al-Harith. Ghaylan is an improvised name, derived from 'Ghaylah' (suckling while pregnant) or 'Ghilah' (deception). We mentioned Uqba previously. Buhaysh: Transferred; diminutive of 'Bahsh'. Al-Harith: Transferred from 'Haratha' (to earn/plough). Al-Harith also: The marrier/plougher of woman. Allah says: 'Your women are a tilth (Harth) for you'. The poet punned:\n'If the locusts ate the tilths (crops) of a people... Then my tilth (wife) is concerned with eating locusts'\nRegarding his nickname: Dhu al-Rumma, it is disputed. Some claimed: Nicknamed for his saying describing a tent peg:\n'The eternity of time did not leave of it... Except three like blackened hearthstones'\n'And other than a buried peg... Disheveled, remaining [with] a piece of worn rope (Rummah) of the garlanding'\nSome claimed: Mayya nicknamed him that. He passed her tent before flirting with her, saw her and liked her. He wanted to talk to her, so he tore his bucket and approached her saying: 'O young lady, sew my bucket for me!' She said: 'I am Kharqa' (clumsy/unskilled)'. Ghaylan was embarrassed, put his bucket on his neck tied with a worn rope (Rummah), and turned back. She did what he wanted (to tease him), then Mayya said: 'O Dhu al-Rumma (Owner of the worn rope), turn back!' So he turned back. Then she said: 'If I am Kharqa, my maid is skilled (Sana'). Sit until she sews your bucket!' She called her maid: 'Sew the bucket.' Dhu al-Rumma used to call Mayya: Kharqa, because she said 'I am Kharqa', and 'Dhu al-Rumma' stuck to him due to her saying 'O Dhu al-Rumma'. This is Tha'lab's view. It is said: Kharqa is not Mayya, but a woman from Banu Amir; he saw her, asked for water, she was shy and refused. He told her mother: 'Tell her to give me drink!' Her mother said: 'Give him drink, O Kharqa!' Thus Dhu al-Rumma said:\n'The perfection of Hajj is that the mounts stop... At Kharqa's, she of the veil'\nAbu al-Abbas al-Ahwal said: Named Dhu al-Rumma because he feared the Evil Eye as a boy, so he was taken to a sheikh who made an amulet for him, tied to his upper arm (with a Rummah)! This is the least likely. The famous is the first (or second) view.\nHis saying: 'Wa hal yurji'u at-taslimu...': He described standing at Mayya's dwelling and greeting it, then denied his action saying: Does greeting or lifting the blindness of passion return to me a quarter empty of its people, containing only tripod stones and desolate traces?! Before it:\n'O two dwellings of Mayya, peace be upon you... Do the times that passed return?'\nYou can raise 'Thalathu al-Athafi' with the first verb (Kufan choice) or the second (Basran choice). Originally 'Athafiyy' (shadda), but usage lightened is more common. Zuhair's verse is narrated with shadda and lightened:\n'Athafiyya suf'an (Black tripods) in the place of a cooking pot... And a trench like the stump of the cistern not broken'\nSingular of 'Athafi': 'Uthfiyyah' (damma on Hamza) and 'Ithfiyyah' (kasra). Grammarians differed on its weight. Some said: 'Uf'ulah', origin 'Uthfuwiyyah', Waw turned to Ya, assimilated, Fa broken for the Ya. They argued Hamza is extra by saying 'Thaffaytu al-qidra' (put pot on tripods), and 'Imra'ah Muthfah' (woman with three husbands), and Al-Kumayt's verse. Some said: Weight is 'Fa'liyyah', Hamza original. Argued with An-Nabigha's verse:\n'Do not throw me into a corner with no equivalent... Even if enemies crowd around you (Ta'aththafaka) with support'\n'Ta'aththafaka' is 'Tafa'alaka'. If from 'Thaffaytu', he would say 'Aththafaka'. Argued also: 'Athfa ar-rahla ithfa'an' (put the geometric pad). A complex Basran issue.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'He ceased not, since his hands tied his waist-wrapper... He rose (Sama) and attained five spans'\n\nThis verse is by Al-Farazdaq, praising Yazid bin al-Muhallab. Before it:\n'And when men see Yazid, you see them... Submissive of necks, lowering the eyes'\n'Sama': Rose. 'Adraka khamsata ashbar': Rose and exceeded the limit of walking; philosophers claimed: If a newborn is born full term without womb defects, he is eight spans of his own span. His navel is the center: 4 spans to top, 4 to bottom. 4 spans from navel to fingertips of both hands spread. If decreased/increased, it's a defect. So if a boy exceeds 4 spans, he begins ascending to full height! Some claimed: He meant the baton Caliphs held. Predicate of 'Ma zala' is in a later verse:\n'He brings close battalions from battalions meeting... With stabbing on a day of fighting and stumbling'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Kam (How many):\n'How many (Kam) a lowly one whom generosity attained heights... And a noble one whom stinginess lowered!'\n\nThis verse is by Anas bin Zunaym, to Abdullah bin Ziyad. Before it:\n'Ask my Emir what changed him... From my connection today until he left it'\n'Do not insult me after you honored me... For severe is a habit stripped away'\n'Let not your promise be a lightning without rain... For the best lightning is that with which is rain'\n'How many a lowly one...'\nAnas: Transferred name; 'Al-Anas': The people. Al-Khansa said:\n'That tribe is the tribe of Banu Sulaym... With their travelers and the residing people (Al-Anas)'\nZunaym: Transferred; diminutive of 'Zanim' truncated. 'Zanim': The bastard/adopted.\n'Al-Muqrif': Lowly father. If lowly mother: 'Hajin'. 'Wada'ahu': Lowered him. Used 'Wada'a' on the rejected original form (usually 'Yada'u'). Some read: 'Ma wada'aka rabbuka'. Poet said:\n'So he strove his striving among his people... Then he did not attain, nor leave incapacity'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'How many (Kam) an aunt of yours, O Jarir, and a maternal aunt... Crooked-footed (Fad'a'), who milked my pregnant camels'\n\nThis verse is by Al-Farazdaq mocking Jarir. After it:\n'Lifting her leg to urinate (Shaghghara), striking the colt with her leg... Milking with fingertips (Fattara) the front teats of first-borns'\n'We used to beware that our milk-camels get lost... But to her [they come] when she hears the call of Yasar'\nHe tells Jarir: How can you compete with me when your aunts were shepherds for my camels? You should respect my right and acknowledge my precedence! 'Al-Fad'a'': One with 'Fada'' (crookedness) in legs from much walking behind camels. 'Fada'': Deviation between foot and leg, or hand and arm. 'Al-'Ishar': Camels in 10th month of pregnancy. 'Ash-Shaghghara': Who lifts leg like a dog urinating. 'Taqidu al-fasil': Hits the colt if it approaches during milking. 'Al-Fatr': Milking with fingertips. 'As-Saff': Milking with whole hand (for large udders). He described her skill in milking as she grew up with it!\nWhoever lowers 'Ammah'/'Khalah' (Genitive) or installs them (Accusative): Makes them many aunts. Whoever raises (Nominative): Makes it one aunt, with abundance applying to the times/action ('How often an aunt...'). Installing/Lowering is more emphatic in satire. If raised/lowered, 'Kam' is News (Khabariyyah) without disagreement. If installed, there is disagreement: As-Sirafi said it is Interrogative (Abu al-Qasim's choice). Al-Farisi said: No meaning for interrogation, but News resembled Interrogative so it installed, just as Interrogative resembles News and lowers ('Ala kam jidh'in...'). Ar-Raba'i mediated: Face is Al-Farisi's, Sirafi's view valid as mocking interrogation!\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Mudh and Mundhu:\n'Whose are the dwellings at the peak of Al-Hijr... They became desolate since (Min) years and since (Min) an age'\n\nThis verse is narrated for Zuhair bin Abi Sulma. Zuhair: Transferred name (diminutive of Zahr or Azhar/Zahir). Sulma: Improvised, damma Sin, shortened like 'Hubla'. Abu Sulma's name: Rabi'ah. 'Al-Qunnah' and 'Al-Qullah': Mountain top. 'Aqwayna': Became desolate. 'Al-Hijaj': Years. Meaning for Basrans: 'Min marri hijaj' (From the passing of years). Narrated: 'Mudh hijaj' and 'Mudh shahr'. This is on the dialect of those who make 'Mudh' genitive always. Abu al-Qasim said: 'It was of his dialect to make Mudh genitive always like Mundhu'. This apologizes for the narration to avoid the objection: How to make genitive with 'Mudh' what passed (past time)? Its rule is raising past and lowering present.\nHowever, the first three verses of this poem are not authenticated as Zuhair's! It is narrated Harun al-Rashid asked Al-Mufaddal: How did Zuhair start with 'Leave this and count the saying on Harim...' without preceding context? Al-Mufaddal said: Poets usually start with nostalgia/travel description. Zuhair intended that, then said to himself: Leave what you intended and turn to praising Harim; he is more worthy! Harun liked this. Hammad ar-Rawiya was present and said: O Commander of the Faithful, this is not the start, before it is:\n'Whose are the dwellings at the peak of Al-Hijr... They became desolate since years and since an age'\n'Time played with them and changed them... After me, the blowers of dust and the rain'\n'Desolate at the stream of An-Nuha'it from... The two banks of possessors of Dal and Sidr trees'\nHarun turned to Al-Mufaddal: 'Did you not say \"Da' dha\" is the start?' He said: 'I never heard this addition until today; it is likely fabricated!' Harun asked Hammad: 'Tell me the truth!' He said: 'I added these verses!' Harun said: 'Whoever wants reliable narration, stick to Al-Mufaddal. Whoever wants abundance, stick to Hammad!'\nModern poets imitated Al-Mufaddal's logic. Ibn ar-Rumi:\n'Pass from you the dwellings, the ruins and the lifeless, No!... Indeed in praising Abu as-Saqr is a distraction from them!'\nAl-Mutanabbi:\n'If it is praise, then the erotic prelude is presented... Is every eloquent poet a lover?'\n'The love of Ibn Abdullah is worthier, for... With it the beautiful mention begins and ends'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Section:\n'You weep for Lubna while you left her... And you were more capable regarding her at Al-Mala'\n\nThis verse is by Qays bin Dharih al-Kinani, one of the famous Arab lovers. His companion was Lubna. Qays, Dharih, Lubna: Transferred names. Qays: Preceded. Dharih: Hills, singular 'Dharihah'. 'Adh-Dharih' and 'Adh-Dharh': Food with saffron. Lubna: A type of perfume (Liquid Styrax). Imru' al-Qays mentioned it:\n'And Ban and Alwiyy from India, fragrant... And Rand and Lubna, and the smoking incense'\n'Al-Mala': Wide land. Or a specific place. Imru' al-Qays:\n'Is it from the memory of a Nabhani woman whose family settled... At the dune of Al-Mala, your eyes tear?'\nHe said 'And you left her' because he had married her, then his father and mother forced him to divorce her. His father swore, placing himself in the sun...",

    "text": "A group claimed: Mayya nicknamed him that (Dhu al-Rumma - Possessor of the Frayed Rope). That was because he passed by her tent before he composed poetry about her. He saw her and she pleased him, so he loved to speak with her. He pierced his bucket, approached her, and said: 'O young woman; stitch my bucket for me!' She said: 'I am *Kharqa*' (clumsy/awkward). *Al-Kharqa* is she who does not do work well. Ghaylan (Dhu al-Rumma) was embarrassed, placed his bucket on his neck—it being tied with a worn-out rope (*Rumma*)—and turned back. She then did what he wanted (or realized his intent). Mayya said to him: 'O Dhu al-Rumma, turn back,' so he turned back! Then she said: 'If I am clumsy, my maidservant is skilled (*Sina'*), so sit until she stitches your bucket!' Then she called her maidservant and said: 'Stitch the bucket.' So Dhu al-Rumma used to call Mayya: *Kharqa*, because of her saying: 'I am Kharqa,' and the name Dhu al-Rumma prevailed over him because of her saying: 'O Dhu al-Rumma.' This is the opinion of Tha'lab. It has been said: *Kharqa* is someone other than Mayya, and that she was a woman from Banu Amir. He saw her, asked her for water, but she was shy and refused to give him water. He said to her mother: 'Tell her to give me water!' Her mother said to her: 'Give him water, O Kharqa!' For that reason, Dhu al-Rumma said: 'The completion of the Hajj is that the riding camels stop ... at Kharqa, who is wearing the veil.' Abu al-Abbas al-Ahwal said: He was named Dhu al-Rumma because the Evil Eye was feared for him while he was a boy, so he was brought to a Sheikh of the tribe to make an amulet for him, and it was tied to his upper arm! This is the furthest of opinions, and the famous one is the first opinion. His saying: 'And does the greeting return...' describes that he stood at Mayya's home and greeted it, then disapproved of his own action, saying: 'Does the greeting return (is it answered), or does it reveal what is in me of the distress of love, which carried me to visit the dwellings, or to greet it: a quarter empty of its people, containing nothing but the *Athafi*, which are the potstones, and the empty ruins (*Rusum Balaqi*)?!' Before it is: 'O two dwellings of Mayya, peace be upon you both ... Do the times that have passed return?' You may put the three *Athafi* in the nominative via the first verb, which is the choice of the Kufans, or via the second, which is the choice of the Basrans. The origin of *Athafi* is with a Shadda (doubled Y), but its usage as lightened (single Y) is more frequent on the tongues of the Arabs. Zuhayr's verse is narrated both with Shadda and lightened: '*Athafi* (Tripod stones) black/scorched in the place where a cooking pot was set ... and a trench like the stump of a tank not broken.' The singular of *Athafi* is called: *Uthfiyya* - with a Dhamma on the Hamza - and *Ithfiyya* - with a Kasra. Grammarians differed on its weight (morphological pattern). Some said: Its weight is *Uf'ulah*, its origin is *Uthfuwiyyah*, then the Waw was changed to Ya, and incorporated into the Ya, and the Fa was broken because of the Ya. They argued that the Hamza is extra based on the Arabs' saying: 'Thaffaytu al-qidra' (I put the pot on the Athafi), and their saying: 'Imra'ah Muthfah' (A woman made like an Athafi), which is one who has had three husbands, likening them to the Athafi. And by the saying of Al-Kumayt: 'And our neighbor's pot was not taken down among others ... nor was it placed on Athafi (*Thuffiyat*) except among us when it is set up.' Others said: Its weight is *Fa'aliyyah* and the Hamza is original (root letter). They argued for this with Al-Nabigha's saying: 'Do not cast at me a corner (support) that has no equal ... even if the enemies gather against you (*Ta'athafaka*) with support.' The weight of *Ta'athafaka* is *Tafa'alaka*. If it were from *Thaffaytu*, he would have said: *Athafaka*. Among their proofs is that it is said: '*Athaftu al-rahla athfan*' (I sought the saddle), regarding a camel. These are among the difficult issues of the Basrans and require more discussion than this, but this is not the place for it. Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'He did not cease, since his hands tied his lower garment ... then he rose and reached five spans.' This verse: Is by Al-Farazdaq, praising Yazid bin al-Muhallab. Before it is: 'And when the men saw Yazid, you saw them ... with humbled necks, lowering their gazes.' The meaning of *Sama*: He rose/grew tall. The meaning of 'reached five spans': He grew tall and exceeded the limit of walking; because the philosophers claimed: If a newborn is born completing the gestation period, and no affliction affects him in the womb, he will be the size of eight spans, of his own span. His navel will be like the center for him. From it to the end of his upper half is four spans of his own span, and from it to the end of his lower half is four spans. And from it to the tips of his fingers of both hands is four spans. So that if he were laid on his back, and his arms opened, and a compass placed on his navel and rotated, it would resemble a circle. They said: Whatever exceeds this or falls short is due to an affliction that happened to him in the womb. For you find one whose upper half is longer than the lower, and one whose lower half is longer than his upper half, and one whose hands are short, and one whose single hand is shorter than the other! So if the boy exceeds four spans, he has begun ascending to the limit of height! A group claimed: He meant the bamboo stick (*Khayzuranah*) that the Caliphs used to hold in their hands. The predicate of 'Ma Zala' (He did not cease) is in another verse after this one, which is:",

    "text": "...He draws battalions close to battalions meeting ... with stabbing on a day of desertion and stumbling. Abu al-Qasim recited in the chapter of *Kam* (How many/much): 'How much (*Kam*) by generosity has a low-born one (*Muqrif*) attained heights ... and a noble one, his miserliness has lowered him!' This verse: Is by Anas bin Zunaym, from poetry he spoke to Abdullah bin Ziyad. Before it is: 'Ask my emir what changed him ... from connecting with me today, until he abandoned it. Do not humiliate me after you honored me ... so strengthen a hand (favor) customarily snatched away. Let not your promise be a deceiving lightning ... for the best lightning is that which has rain with it. How much by generosity has a low-born one attained heights ... and a noble one, his miserliness has lowered him.' Anas: Is one of the transferred names; because *Al-Anas* means the people (*Al-Nas*). Al-Khansa said: 'So that tribe is the tribe of Banu Sulaym ... with their departing ones and the residing people (*Al-Anas*).' Zunaym: Also transferred; because it is the diminutive of *Zanim* (trimmed), which is the adopted one/bastard. *Al-Muqrif*: One of base father (if the mother is base, he is *Hajin*). He says: Generosity elevates the base one until his status rises! And miserliness lowers the status of the noble one until his matter becomes insignificant! He brought 'Wada'a' (he left/abandoned) based on the rejected original form (usually *Yada'u* is used). Some readers recited: 'Ma wadda'aka rabbuka' (Your Lord has not forsaken you - distinct from *Wada'a*). Similar is the saying of another: 'He strove his striving among his people ... then he did not reach, nor did he leave (*Wada'*) an inability.' Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'How many (*Kam*) an aunt of yours, O Jarir, and a maternal aunt ... *Fad'aa* (club-footed/distorted hand) has milked my *'Ishar* (pregnant camels)!' This verse is by Al-Farazdaq satirizing Jarir. After it is: '*Shaghara* (Leg-lifter) who strikes the young camel with her leg ... *Fattara* (finger-milker) of the front teats of the first-born camels. We used to beware that our milk-camels would be lost ... and she has, when she hears the call of Yasar.' He says to Jarir: How can you contend with me when your paternal and maternal aunts were herders for my camels? You ought to respect my right and acknowledge my precedence and priority! *Al-Fad'aa*: She who is afflicted with *Fada'* in her legs from excessive walking behind camels. *Al-Fada'*: A deviation and tilt in the foot between it and the leg, and in the palm: a deviation and tilt between it and the forearm. *Al-'Ishar*: She-camels that have entered the tenth month of their pregnancy; singular: *'Ushara'*. *Al-Shaghara*: She who lifts her leg as a dog lifts it when urinating. 'She strikes (*Taqiddu*) the young camel with her leg': Hits it if it approaches her during milking. *Al-Fatr*: Milking with the tips of the fingers. If it is with the whole hand, it is *Al-Saff*. *Al-Saff* is only for large she-camels. As for the small ones, they are milked with the fingertips due to the shortness of their udders. He described her skill and knowledge of milking because she grew up doing it! Whoever puts 'Aunt' (*'Ammah*) and 'Maternal Aunt' (*Khalah*) in the genitive or accusative: makes them many aunts. Whoever puts them in the nominative: makes them one aunt and one maternal aunt, making the abundance apply to the occurrences (of the act), as you say: 'How many (*Kam*) Zayd came to me,' meaning: 'Many times Zayd came to me.' Therefore, the accusative and genitive are more eloquent in satire! If the aunt and maternal aunt are nominative or genitive, then *Kam* is Predicative/Exclamatory (*Ikhbar*) without dispute. If he puts them in the accusative, there is a dispute: Al-Sirafi used to say: It is Interrogative (*Istifham*), and this is what Abu al-Qasim—may God have mercy on him—went with. Al-Farisi used to say: There is no meaning for interrogation here, but he likened the News/Predicative *Kam* to the Interrogative one, so he installed the accusative with it, just as he likened the Interrogative to the Predicative so he put the genitive with it, in your saying: 'Ala kam jidh'in baytuka mabni' (On how many trunks is your house built?). Abu al-Hasan al-Raba'i took a middle path between them, saying: The correct view is what Abu Ali said, but what Al-Sirafi said is permissible on the basis that he is questioning him mockingly! Abu al-Qasim recited in the chapter of *Mudh* and *Mundhu* (Since): 'To whom belong the dwellings at the peak of Al-Hijr ... they have become desolate since (*Min*) years (*Hujaj*) and since (*Min*) an era (*Dahr*)?' This verse: Is narrated for Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma. Zuhayr: One of the transferred names, as we mentioned previously. As for Sulma: It is one of the improvised names, with a Damma on the Seen, shortened (Maqsur) on the pattern of *Hubla*. The name of Abu Sulma was Rabi'ah. Rabi'ah: A name transferred from *Rabi'ah*, which is the helmet/egg of armor. *Al-Qunnah*: And *Al-Qullah* with Lam and Nun - The top of the mountain. *Aqwayna*: They became empty/desolate. *Al-Hujaj*: Years; singular is *Hijjah*. Its meaning according to the Basrans: Since years passed, and since an era passed, meaning: They became desolate because of the passing of years and eras and their succession upon them. It is narrated: '*Mudh* Hujajin' and '*Mudh* Dahrin' (Since years/Since an era). This is according to the dialect of those who use the genitive with *Mudh* in all cases. For this reason, Abu al-Qasim said: 'And it was of his dialect to use the genitive with *Mudh* in all cases and treat it like *Mundhu*,' meaning Zuhayr was from the people of this dialect.",

    "text": "This is an apology for this narration; lest it be said to one who narrates thus: 'How do you put the past in the genitive with *Mudh*, when its rule is to put the past in the nominative, and the present (what you are in) in the genitive?!' However, the three verses at the beginning of this poem have not been authenticated as belonging to Zuhayr! It has been narrated that Harun al-Rashid said to Al-Mufaddal bin Muhammad: 'How did Zuhayr begin his poem with his saying: 'Leave this, and count the speech regarding Harim ... the best of those present and the master of the settled-dwellers,' when nothing preceded it to refer back to?' Al-Mufaddal said: 'It was the custom of the poets to present before the praise a prelude (*Tashbib*), a description of camels, riding through deserts, and the like. It is as if Zuhayr intended that, then said to himself: Leave what you intended—of what is customary—and turn your speech to the praise of Harim; for he is the most worthy of one for whom speech is embellished and composed, and the most deserving of one with whose mention speech begins and ends!' Al-Rashid approved of his saying. Hammad al-Rawiya was present, so he said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, this is not the beginning of the poem, but before it is: 'To whom belong the dwellings at the peak of Al-Hijr ... they have become desolate since years and since an era. Time played with them and changed them ... after me, the scattering winds of dust and the rain. A wasteland at the outpouring of Al-Nahait from ... the two sides of the owners of Dal and Sidr trees.'' Al-Rashid turned to Al-Mufaddal and said: 'Did you not say that 'Leave this...' is the beginning of the poem?' He said: 'I have not heard of this addition until this day of mine, and it is likely to be a fabrication!' Al-Rashid said to Hammad: 'Tell me the truth!' He said: 'I added these verses to it!' Al-Rashid said: 'Whoever wants reliability and good, correct narration, let him stick to Al-Mufaddal; and whoever wants abundance and expansion, let him stick to Hammad!' Modern poets have followed this speech of Al-Mufaddal. Ibn al-Rumi said: 'Pass over the dwellings, the ruins, and the dead (memories), No??! Indeed, in the praise of Abu al-Saqr there is a distraction from them!' And Al-Mutanabbi said: 'If there is praise, the amatory prelude is put forward ... Is every eloquent one who recites poetry enslaved by love? The love of Ibn Abdullah is more worthy, for ... by him, beautiful mention is begun and ended.' Abu al-Qasim recited in this section: 'You weep for Lubna while you left her ... and you were, regarding her, by Him who holds the vacant lands (*Al-Mala*), more capable?!' This verse is by Qays bin Dharih al-Kinani. He is one of the famous lovers of the Arabs, and his companion for whom he was famous is Lubna. Qays, Al-Dharih, and Lubna are transferred names. As for Qays, it has been mentioned. As for *Al-Dharih*, it is the hills; singular *Dhariha*. *Al-Dharih* and *Al-Dharh*: Food in which saffron is put. As for *Al-Lubna*, it is a type of perfume/incense; it is said to be storax (*May'ah*). Imru' al-Qays mentioned this in his saying: 'And Ban (willow) and Aloe from India, fragrant ... and Rand (laurel) and Lubna, and the smoking incense.' *Al-Mala*: The wide expanse of earth. *Al-Mala* is also a specific place. Imru' al-Qays said: 'Is it from the memory of a Nabhani woman whose family settled ... at the sandy tract of *Al-Mala* that your eyes are rushing (with tears)?' He only said: 'And you left her,' because he had married her, then his father and mother tasked him with divorcing her. His father swore an oath, placed himself in the scorching heat, and said: 'By God, I will not leave this spot until I die or you divorce her'—while he refused to divorce her due to the intensity of his infatuation with her! His people made his action seem ugly to him and said: 'If your father dies in this state, it will be a shame upon you. Satisfy your father by divorcing her, then take her back after that!' So he divorced her. Then he wanted to take her back, but she refused then, and her father refused, and married her to another! For that reason, he said: 'The slanderers surrounded me and disturbed me ... So oh God, (judgment) for the obeyed slanderer.' And he said: 'If the world has changed regarding Lubna ... then Time and the World have bellies (interiors) and backs (exteriors). There was in her a place for trust ... and a pasture for the heart and a view for the eye.' The meaning of his saying: 'Then Time and the World have bellies and backs': He meant that the matters of the world include that in which the correct face is apparent to a human, and that which is hidden from him! Abu al-Qasim recited in the chapter of the Vocative (*Nida*): 'So O Rider, if you pass by, convey ... to my drinking companions from Najran that we shall not meet.' This verse is by Abd Yaghuth bin Waqqas al-Harithi. Yaghuth: Name of an idol to which he was attributed. Waqqas: Active participle from their saying:",

    "text": "And 'Qassat 'unuquhu' (his neck broke) if you broke it; it is a description transferred to naming. Abd Yaghuth was one of those captured on the Day of Al-Kulab. Taym ar-Rabab captured him, seeking vengeance for a man of theirs named An-Nu'man bin Jassas. He was certain he would be killed, so he said this poetry lamenting himself. It begins:\n'Do not blame me, for blame is enough for what I am in... For there is no good in blame for you nor for me'\n'Do you not know that blame, its benefit... Is little, and my blaming my brother is not of my nature (Shamali)?'\n'So O rider, if you pass by (Aradta), then convey... To my boon-companions from Najran that there is no meeting'\n'Abu Kurab and the two Ayhams, both... And Qays at the highest of Hadramout the Yemeni'\nMeaning of 'Aradta': Presented yourself/Passed by. 'An' is lightened from the heavy version, its name is hidden. Estimation: 'Annahu la talaqiya lana' (That there is no meeting for us). The predicate of 'La' of negation is deleted. The sentence is in the place of the predicate of 'An'. He meant: 'Min ahli Najran' (From the people of Najran), deleting the annexed noun. Abu Kurab, The two Ayhams: Men of Yemen. Qays: Ibn Ma'adi Yakrub, Abu Qays bin al-Ash'ath al-Kindi. 'Ash-Shimal': Singular of 'Shama'il' (Nature/Character).\n\nAbu al-Qasim - may Allah have mercy on him - recited in this Chapter:\n'Lo, O Palm tree from Dhat Irq... Upon you and the mercy of Allah be peace'\n\nThis verse: I do not know who it belongs to. Some attribute it to Al-Ahwas. Dhat Irq: A place. 'Min Dhat Irq': In the place of an adjective for 'Nakhlah', as if saying: 'O Palm tree existing from Dhat Irq'. 'Min' is attached to a deleted element.\n'Alayki wa rahmatullahi as-salamu': Abu al-Hasan al-Akhfash's view is he meant: 'Alayki as-salamu wa rahmatullahi', moving the coordinated element forward out of necessity. Parallel to Dhu al-Rumma:\n'As if we are upon the children of a white-flanked [wild ass], [the heat] changed her... And the throwing of the dust her breaths, with arrows'\nEstimation: 'Lahaha janubun wa ramyu as-safiy' (A south wind and the throwing of dust changed her). Al-Akhfash said this because 'As-Salam' to him is a subject raised by the 'Istiqrar' (Settling/Existence) hidden in 'Alayki'. This does not bind Sibawayh in his school, because 'As-Salam' to him is raised by Inchoation (Mubtada) and 'Alayki' is a preposed predicate. 'Rahmatullah' acts as coordinate to the raised pronoun in 'Alayki'. So 'Ala' has no place according to Al-Akhfash, but has a place according to Sibawayh.\n'The Palm tree' in this place: Metonymy for a woman. Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, had forbidden poets from mentioning women in their poetry due to the scandal. Poets used trees etc. as metonymy for women. Therefore Humayd bin Thawr al-Hilali said:\n'And am I, if I distract myself with a Sarhah tree... Of the forest, is a path blocked against me?'\n'Allah refused but that a Sarhah belonging to Malik... Over all the branches of the thorny trees, pleases/excels'\n'It went in width (grew wide), and nothing tops its height... Among the forest except a sparse or tall one'\n'So the shade of the cool forenoon, you cannot can utilize it... Nor do you taste the shade (Fay') of the cool evening'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Is it a dwelling at Hazwa that stirred a tear for the eye... So the water of passion pours or trickles?!'\n\nThis verse is by Dhu al-Rumma, and we mentioned his name previously. After it:\n'Like my crying at the trace of a house, as if... In a soft sandy ground (Wa'sa') stripped by sand-hills, it is a parchment'\n'We stopped and greeted, and almost - to an overlooking one... Recognizing my voice - the dung (remains) of the house spoke'\n'The soul boils towards me in every stopping place... Of Mayya, and the yearning heart is terrified'\nHazwa: Place name. 'Hijta': Stirred/Excited. 'Al-Abrah': Tear. He named tears 'Water of Passion' because passion pours and makes them flow. 'Yarfaddu': Falls scattered. 'Yataraqraqu': Moves to and fro in the eye. His saying 'Ka-musta'biri': I cried for this house at Hazwa like my crying for that remote house. 'Musta'bir': Source with Meem attached, coming on the form of the passive participle (Maf'ul), as said: 'Iktasabtu iktisaban wa muktasaban'. It is regular for every verb exceeding three letters that its source comes on the form of its passive participle. 'Al-Wa'sa'': Soft smooth sand. 'Tansuha': Strips/Connects to it (from 'Nasawtu ar-rajula' - took by forelock). Narrated 'Tadnuha' (dotted Dad) - reveals/shows it. 'Al-Jamahir': Huge sands. 'Al-Mahraq': Parchment/Paper.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Lo, O servants of Allah, my heart is enslaved (Mutayyam)... By the best of those who prayed, and the ugliest of them as a husband (Ba'la)'\n\nThis verse: I do not know its author. In many copies it appeared as 'Fi'lan' (in deed), which is a mistake and corruption, even if it has a good meaning, because what follows this verse invalidates it, which is his saying:\n'He crawls upon her intestines every night... The crawl of the horned beetle exploring a soft sandy hill'\nThe second verse indicates he is praising a woman and mocking her husband. He said: She is the most beautiful of people, and likened him when he mounts her for intercourse to a horned beetle crawling on a sandy hill, referring to her abundant flesh and large buttocks. In 'Tadubbu' is a pronoun returning to 'Ba'l' (husband). 'Al-Qurana': Type of beetle. 'An-Naqa': Long sand hill. 'Taqru': Travels/Explores. 'Ad-Dabib': Weak walking. 'Al-Mutayyam': Enslaved by love; from 'Tayyamahu al-hubb'. Hence 'Taym Allat' (Slave of Allat), Allat being an idol.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Hurayra said when I came visiting her... Woe upon you, and woe is me from you, O man!'\n\nThis verse is by Al-Asha of Bakr, name mentioned previously. Narrated: 'Waylan 'alayka', 'Wayla' (kasra/fatha). 'Za'iraha': Accusative as Hal. Meaning: Woe upon you because you might be killed because of me, and woe is me from you because you will expose me! After it:\n'O who has seen a rain cloud I spent the night watching... As if lightning in its edges are torches'\n'It has a rear rider and a middle, filled, active... Girded with water buckets, connected'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Azza greeted you after abandonment and turned away... So greet, woe to you, he who greeted you, O camel!'\n'Would that the greeting was for me so I could thank her... Instead of: O Camel: You have been greeted, O man!'\n\nThis poetry is by Kuthayyir Azza, mentioned previously. Azza had abandoned him and sworn not to speak to him. Then she met him in Mecca and struck his camel with her hand saying: 'May Allah greet you, O camel!' His saying 'Ya Jamalan': The norm was to raise 'Jamal' (nominative), leaving nunation, building it on damma, because of her addressing it with vocative, just as 'Rajul' is raised by address. But he was forced [by meter], so he nunated it and returned it to its origin (accusative indefinite). This is Abu Amr bin al-Ala's choice. It is narrated: 'Ya Jamalu huyyita' - with Raf' - and its nunation is for necessity. Leaving it on its Raf' is the choice of Al-Khalil and Sibawayh, may Allah have mercy on them. After this poetry:\n'If you had greeted her, you would have remained loved... By me, and night travel and work would not have touched you'\n'So he fell from a trunk when I said that to him... And he desired to speak to her, if only camels spoke!'\nNarrated: 'Fa-aqbalaha'. Narrated: 'Yawm an-nafr' (Day of Departure - Hajj).\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Lo, O Zayd and Ad-Dahhak, travel... For you have passed the cover (Khamar) of the road'\n\nThis verse: I do not know its author. 'Al-Khamar': Everything that covers a person etc., like trees. 'As-Sura': Travel specifically at the end of the night (Sahar). He says to his two companions: You have passed the place where the road is cut off (unsafe), so travel safely and leave what you are doing (fear/hiding).\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'So Ka'b bin Mama and Ibn Su'da are not... More generous than you, O Umar the Generous'\n\nThis verse is by Jarir bin al-Khatafi, in a poem praising Umar bin Abd al-Aziz. After it are verses:\n'Forbearance returns from you upon Quraysh...

    "text": "'Alert, O servants of God, my heart is enslaved (*Mutayyam*) ... by the best of those who pray, and the ugliest of them as a husband (*Ba'la*)!' This verse: I do not know its speaker. In many copies, it appears as 'Fi'la' (in action), which is an error and misinterpretation, even if it has a good meaning, because what follows this verse invalidates it, which is his saying: 'He crawls upon her intestines every night ... the crawl of the *Qarani* (beetle) climbing a soft sand dune.' The second verse indicates that he is praising a woman and satirizing her husband. He said: She is the most beautiful of people, and he likened him, when he mounts her for intercourse, to a *Qarani* crawling over a sand dune (*Naqa*), pointing to the abundance of her flesh and the size of her buttocks. In 'Tadibbu' (crawls), there is a pronoun referring to the husband. *Al-Qarani*: A type of beetle. *Al-Naqa*: The elongated sand dune. *Taqru*: Moves from place to place. *Al-Dabib*: Weak walking. *Al-Mutayyam*: One whom love has enslaved; from it is said: Taym Allat, and Al-Lat is an idol. Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'Hurayrah said when I came visiting her ... 'Woe upon you, and woe to me from you, O man!'' This verse is by Al-A'sha of Bakr, and we have mentioned his name previously. It is narrated: 'Waylun' (woe) upon you, and 'Waylan'. It is narrated with Kasra on the Lam and Fatha. 'Zairaha' (visiting her): Accusative as a circumstantial state (*Hal*). Its meaning: Woe upon you, because you will be killed on my account; and woe to me from you, because you will expose me! After it is: 'O you who saw a rain cloud that I spent the night watching ... as if the lightning in its edges were torches. It has a rear (clouds) and a filled center, active ... girded with buckets of water, continuous.' Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'Azza greeted you after the abandonment and turned away ... So greet, woe to you, the one who greeted you, O Camel (*Ya Jumalu*)! Would that the greeting were for me so I could thank her ... in place of 'O Camel'; may you be greeted, O man!' This poetry is by Kuthayyir Azza, and we have mentioned him in the past. Azza had abandoned him and sworn not to speak to him. Then she met him in Mecca, tapped his camel with her hand, and said: 'May God greet you, O camel!' His saying: 'Ya Jumalan' (O Camel - accusative): The norm was the nominative for 'Jumal' (O Jumalu), omitting the Tanwin (nunation) and building it on the Damma, because of her turning to it with the call (*Nida*), just as 'Al-Rajul' (The Man) takes the nominative when turned to. But he was compelled (by meter), so he added the Tanwin and returned it to its original form (accusative/indefinite). This is the choice of Abu Amr ibn al-Ala. It has been narrated: 'Ya Jumalu Huyyita...' - in the nominative - and adding Tanwin to it for necessity, while leaving it in its nominative state is the choice of Al-Khalil and Sibawayh, may God Almighty have mercy on them. After this poetry: 'If you had greeted her, you would have remained possessing love ... with me, and the night journey and work would not have touched you. So he (the camel) fell from fright when I said that to him ... and desired to speak to her, if only camels spoke!' It is narrated: 'Fa-aqbalaha' (so he approached her). And it is narrated: 'Day of the Nafr', which is the day of concluding the Hajj. Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'Ho, O Zayd and Al-Dahhak, travel ... for you have passed the cover (*Khamar*) of the road.' This verse: I do not know its speaker. *Al-Khamar*: Everything that conceals a person or other things, like trees etc. *Al-Sura*: Traveling specifically at the time of magic (pre-dawn). He says to his two companions: You have passed the place where the path is cut off, so travel safely, and leave what you are doing. Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'Ka'b bin Mamah and Ibn Su'da are not ... more generous than you, O Umar the Generous (*Ya Umar-al-Jawada*).' This verse is by Jarir bin al-Khatafi, in a poem praising Umar bin Abd al-Aziz. After it are verses: 'Forbearance returns from you upon Quraysh ... and you relieve them of severe distresses. You have secured their fear with gentleness ... while your wildness (aloofness) tires the people to be hunted! You call upon God, striving, so He may be pleased ... and you remind your subjects of the Return (Afterlife).' By 'Ibn Su'da', he meant: Aws bin Haritha bin La'm al-Ta'i. Su'da: His mother. Bishr bin Khazim mentioned him in his saying: 'To Aws bin Haritha bin Su'da ... to fulfill my need among those whose needs he fulfilled. No one like Ibn Su'da has trodden the earth ... nor worn sandals when he put them on.' Ka'b: He is Ka'b bin Mamah al-Iyadi, the one who prioritized another over himself regarding water, until he died of thirst!",

    "text": "The story of that was: He was in a caravan, and with him was a man from An-Namir bin Qasit named Ya'fur bin Qasit. Water became scarce for them. They gave what water they had to a man to divide equally. He would put a round smooth stone in a vessel, then pour water over it until it was covered, and give each man his share. That stone is called 'Al-Muqlah'. This was called 'Tasafin'. When the cupbearer wanted to give Ka'b his share, the Namiri man would look at Ka'b with a gaze of desire and pleading! So Ka'b would say: 'Give drink to your brother the Namiri!' He kept doing this until Ka'b became exhausted and weak. They had camped near the water source. Ka'b was given glad tidings and told: 'Go down [to water], you have reached the water!' But he had no strength to rise, and fell dead! His father said mourning him and mentioning him:\n'Ka'b overlooked the water, then it was said to him: Go down... Ka'b, you are a comer to water (Warrad). But he did not go down (Warada)'\nAl-Farazdaq mentioned this. He was traveling in a caravan, water became scarce, they rationed it (Tasafanu). A man from Banu al-Anbar bin Amr bin Ghanam asked him to prefer him with his share. Al-Farazdaq did so! Then he asked him to prefer him a second time, but he refused, and said regarding that:\n'When we rationed the waterskin, the creases of... The big-bellied Anbari man wept to me'\n'He brought a rock like his head... For the water to be poured over it among the determined men'\n'So I preferred him when I saw what was with him... In a state where I fear the pursuing blames'\n'In a state where if Hatim were among the people... Hatim would not have been generous with water despite his generosity!'\n'And we were like the companions of Ibn Mama when he gave drink... To the thirsty brother of Namir on the Day of Daja'im'\n'When Ka'b said: Have you quenched Ibn Qasit?... He says to him: Increase me, [for it is] the wetting of throats!'\n'So I was like Ka'b except that my death... Its stripping by the prominent places was delayed from me!'\n'And I was hoping for thanks from him when he came to... The people of Syria from the people of Al-Hufayr and Jasim'\n'The Anbari wished to mock me, and I thought myself... Strong of bridle (dignity), a target for stone-throwers'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Peace of Allah, O Matar, upon her... And not upon you, O Matar, is the peace'\n\nThis verse is by Al-Ahwas. His name is Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Asim al-Ansari. 'Al-Ahwas': One with narrow eyes. 'Al-Muhammad': Who is praised much, attributed to Hamd (Praise). Zuhair said:\n'Is he not overflowing [generosity], his hands are a cloud... Support for orphans in the years [of drought], Muhammad?'\n'Asim': Active participle of 'Ismah'. The Nun in 'Matar' is for necessity (Nunation kept in vocative). After it:\n'If marriage is the most lawful thing... Then the marriage of her to Matar is Haram (forbidden)'\n'So divorce her, for you are not her equal... Otherwise the sword will rise over your parting'\n'So may God not forgive those who married her [to you]... Their sins, even if they prayed and fasted'\nMatar was ugly, and Hind (the wife) was of noble lineage. He was the ugliest of people, and his wife the most beautiful! He meant: 'If you do not divorce her, the sword will rise over your head', deleting the condition due to the indication of what preceded it. As Zuhair said:\n'Otherwise (if you don't desist), then we are at Ash-Sharbah and Al-Liwa... Hamstringing the mothers of the young camels and the old ones'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'She struck her chest towards me and said... O Adiyya, the protectors have protected you'\n\nThis verse is by Muhalhil bin Rabi'ah at-Taghlibi. His name is Adi. Ibn al-Kalbi claimed his name is Imru' al-Qays. Named 'Muhalhil' because he was the first to thin (Halahala - refine/weave thinly) poetry. Ibn al-Kalbi claimed he was named Muhalhil for his saying in a poem:\n'When their noisy crowd became rugged in the dust... I thinned (Halhaltu) to avenge Jabir or Sinbil'\nIbn al-Kalbi mentioned that 'Darabat sadraha ilayya' is not by Muhalhil, but by his brother Adi [meaning Udayy/Adi, likely confusion in names or narration]. Others recited:\n'A tender one (Taflah), the daughter of Al-Muhallal is not... High-nosed (Shamma'), playful, delicious in embrace'\n'A doe from the does of Wajrah, reaching up... And her hands are among green leaves'\n'She struck her chest towards me and said... O Adiyya, the protectors have protected you'\n'Depart, what is towards you is not far... One in bonds does not suit embracing'\n'I do not hope for life after my boon-companions... I see them given to drink from the cup of death (Halaq)'\n'After Amr and Amir and Hayy... And Rabi' as-Saduf and the two sons of Unaq'\n'And Kulayb, the poison of horsemen when... The shooters of the brave protectors aimed [at him]'\n'Indeed under the stones are firmness and generosity... And a quarrelsome opponent, fierce, possessor of a hook (Mi'laq)'\n'A snake in the den (Wujar), dusky-colored... The bitten one does not benefit from the blowing of a charmer'\n'Taflah' (fatha): Soft-bodied. 'Tiflah' (kasra): Small girl. 'Shamma'': High-nosed. 'Waqatka': Protected you. 'Al-Awaqi': Plural of 'Waqiyah' (Protector/Protection), referring to God's protection and decrees.",

    "text": "It means: Allah protected you from great matters where you were on the verge of destruction. He disliked the combination of two Waws (Wawaqi), so he changed the first Waw to Hamza, carrying the broken plural on the diminutive if you said 'Uwayqiyah'. 'Halaq': Name for death, built on kasra like 'Hizam' and 'Qatam'. 'Al-Kumah': The brave ones, singular 'Kamin' like 'Qadin' (judge) and 'Da'in' (caller), plurals 'Qudah' and 'Du'ah'. 'Al-Ifaq': Placing the arrow on the string to shoot. 'Al-Aladd': Fierce in dispute. 'Al-Mighlaq' (dotted Ghayn): What locks a door. Narrated 'Mi'laq' (undotted Ayn): Like a hook that catches things; meaning if he catches his opponent, he doesn't escape. Al-Ba'ith said:\n'Fierce, if I meet a people in a plan... A wounding saddle-sore persists on their shoulders'\n'Al-Wujar' (fatha/kasra): Hyena's den, used for others. 'Al-Arbad': Inclining to blackness. This poem indicates it is by Muhalhil, contrary to Ibn al-Kalbi.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Did you not hear: O Abda, in the brightness of the forenoon... The crying of doves that have a cooing?'\n\nThis verse: I do not know its author. Some claim it is Kuthayyir. 'Ay Abda': Meant 'Ya Abdah' (O Abdah - truncated). 'Rawnaq ad-Duha': Its brightness and light. 'Al-Hadir' and 'Al-Hadil': Sound of the pigeon/dove. 'Hadara yahdiru' and 'Hadala yahdilu'. 'Li-hunna hadirun': Sentence in the place of an adjective for 'Hamamat'. After it:\n'They cried and stirred my longing and passion... And eras have passed since the time of meeting'\nArabs differ regarding the pigeon's sound; some consider it crying, claiming it cries for a chick that died in the time of Noah, peace be upon him, calling it 'Hadil'. Al-Kumayt said:\n'And there is none whom you call for victory... Closer in answer to you than a Hadil (pigeon)'\nSome consider it singing, as the other said:\n'Lo, may Allah fight the pigeons of the morning... On a branch, they stirred us when they sang'\nAbu al-Ala expressed doubt in that saying:\n'Did that pigeon cry or did she sing... On the branch of her swaying bough?!'\n'Neither has come to us, everything passes... But we are in a world that does not know!'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Is it a slave who settled in Shu'abay, a stranger... Is it meanness, may you have no father, and alienation?!'\n\nThis verse is by Jarir bin al-Khatafi. We mentioned his name and lineage previously. The reason for saying this poem: He mocked Ar-Ra'i an-Numayri saying in his satire:\n'If Banu Tamim are angry with you... You reckon all the people are angry'\nAl-Abbas or Khalid bin Yazid al-Kindi, who was residing at Shu'abay, opposed him saying in reply:\n'Lo, may the noses of Banu Tamim be rubbed in dust... The farters of dates, if they are angry'\n'Banu Tamim were angry with me... So they did not harm a fly with their anger'\n'If the crow looked upon Tamim... And what shameful things are in it, it would turn gray'\nJarir mocked him saying:\n'If the wretched one is ignorant and did not estimate... Some of the matter, he is about to be struck'\n'Rhymes will rise from the peaks of Shu'abay... Upon the Kindi, flaming intensely'\n'Is it a slave who settled in Shu'abay, a stranger... Is it meanness, may you have no father, and alienation?!'\n'Hudaybah is not hidden when she spends the evening... Nor her feeding the dogs with her lamb'\n'She pierces her two milking vessels with arrowheads... And her placenta has wetted the dust'\nSibawayh allowed in 'A-'abdan' to be a vocative (O slave!), or accusative as Hal (State), as if saying: 'Do you boast while being a slave?', i.e., in the state of slavery, for boasting does not befit a slave! 'Shu'abay': A place. 'Ghariban': Accusative as adjective for 'Abdan', or Hal from pronoun in 'Halla'.\nHis saying: 'A-lu'man la abalaka wa ightiraban': They are accusative in two ways: First: Estimation 'A-tal'amu lu'man wa taghtaribu ightiraban' (Do you be mean... and be alienated...), so they are sources (Masadir) installed by hidden verbs. Second: Estimation 'A-tajma'u lu'man wa ightiraban' (Do you combine meanness and alienation?), hiding one verb acting on both. This way is better to me. The Alif in 'A-lu'ma' is Alif of rebuke and denial, like in Al-Ajjaj's saying:\n'Is it playfulness (A-taraban) while you are old (Qinnasriyyu)?!... While only the boy engages in play (Siba)'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Two Nouns with One Wording, the Second Added:\n'O Taym, Taym of Adi, may you have no father... Let not Umar find you in a disgraceful situation!'\n\nThis verse is by Jarir, saying it to Umar bin Laja. The reason: Jarir passed by Umar bin Laja while he was reciting a Rajaz poem of his, and people were listening. He stopped to listen. When he reached:\n'She came to the water before the time of her forenoon... Preying on snakes in her skin'\n'Dragging with ease whoever doubted her... Like the dragging of the old woman the sides of her tent'\nJarir said to him: 'You did badly and failed in what you said!' Umar said: 'How should I say?' He said: 'Say: Like the dragging of the bride the train of her sleeves.' Umar was embarrassed and said: 'You are in a worse state than me where you say:\nMy people are more protective of the truth than you... And more striking against the tyrant while dust rises\nAnd more trustworthy with the pillion-riding women (Murdafat) in the evening... In catching up when the cutting sword is unsheathed'\nJarir had actually said 'With the slender swords (Murhafat)', but Umar narrated it as 'Murdafat' (pillion riders). Then Umar said to Jarir: 'They were taken in the morning, and you caught them in the evening? By Allah, I only caught them after they were married and disgraced!' Jarir said: 'By Allah, this verse is dearer to me than my first-born Hazarah! But you plotted for Al-Farazdaq and directed it against me, and you will know!' Then Jarir recited his poem saying:\n'Clear the way for the one who builds the lighthouse in it... And come out to a duel where fate compels you'\n'O Taym, Taym of Adi, may you have no father... Let not Umar find you in a disgraceful situation'\n'You ceased not speaking sayings that reach me... The wind of the bitter plant until the clay rose'\n'Is it when you were poison, O Banu Laja... And Mudar bet against me regarding its haseb (merits)?!'\nUmar bin Laja answered him:\n'You lied, and the worst speech is the most lying... Mudar did not bet against you regarding its haseb'\n'Are you not the leap of a weak man upon a slave girl... Meanness and weakness do not win the races'\n'Whatever bitter thing you say, I will demolish it... O son of the female donkey, by the likes of me ropes are undone'\n\nThen we turn to the explanation of the first verse: 'Ya Tayma Tayma Adiyyin': Two grammatical views. Sibawayh: The first Taym is added to Adi, and the second Taym is emphatic, inserted between the governor (Added-to) and the governed (Added-to noun), like the insertion of 'Ma' in 'Fa-bima rahmatin mina Allahi linta lahum'. Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad: First Taym added to a deleted element indicated by what follows, as if saying: 'O Taym of Adi, O Taym of Adi'. Al-Farra' went similarly. The vowel in first Taym is case vowel, second is following vowel (Sibawayh). Both are case vowels (Mubarrad). If believed both nouns became one like 'Hadramout' added to Adi: First Taym built (Mabni), second declinable. As-Sirafi allowed it like 'Ya Zaydu bin Amr', making described and adjective like one noun.\n'La aba lakum': 'La' of negation (Tabri'ah), its predicate deleted: 'La aba lakum mawjudun' (No father for you exists). If asked: Why not 'Lakum' as predicate? The answer: The preventing factor is the appearance of Alif in 'Aba'. The vowel letters in 'Ab' and sisters are original, appearing only in addition (Idafa). So due to Alif, it must be added to the pronoun, and the Lam is inserted to emphasize the addition. Since this is the case, 'Lakum' cannot be the predicate. The genitive phrase is the predicate only if Alif is deleted: 'La abba laka', as Nahar bin Tawsi'ah said: 'Islam refused, I have no father other than it...'.\nIf asked: How is the Lam 'inserted extra' when saying 'La abaka' is invalid because 'Ab' becomes definite by addition to pronoun, and 'La' doesn't work on definite? So if this Lam prepared the noun for 'La', how is it extra? Answer: It is counted for preparing the noun, and not counted regarding the Alif fixation. Contradiction? No, different aspects.\nIf asked: In 'La aba li-Zaydin', is 'Zaydin' genitive by addition of 'Aba' or by 'Lam'? Answer: Choice is genitive by Lam. Reason: Two operators on one noun is impossible. Suspending one is necessary. Suspending the Noun (Ab) is better because Nouns are suspended (e.g. 'Khayrin wa afdala min thamma'), while Particles rarely suspended except 'Ba' in 'Laysa Zaydun bi-qa'imin' (Za'idah). Also Noun is stronger. Ibn Jinni allowed suspending the Noun. Suspending the Particle possible in narration ('Bi-nama sahibuhu').\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of What Must Keep the Ya:\n'O daughter of my uncle (Amma), do not blame and sleep'\n\nThis verse is by Abu an-Najm al-Ajli. Name: Al-Fadl bin Qudama. Qudama: Improvised from 'Taqdim'. Al-Fadl/An-Najm: Transferred. After it:\n'Do not let me hear blame from you, and hear!... Far, far away, and do not look/expect'\n'They are the decrees, so blame or leave it... Do not hope for my separation, do not hope!'\nNarrated: 'Hiya al-mulazim' (The sticking decrees).\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'O son of my mother, and O little brother of my soul... You left me to a severe time'\n\nThis verse: Narrated for Abu Zubayd at-Ta'i. Name: Harmala bin al-Mundhir. In a poem:\n'Except that Al-Julah broke my wing... The day I left him at the high Sa'id'\n'On the right of the road, at a grave (Sada)... Thirsty, calling at night, not visited'\n'Thirsty asking for aid, not aided... And he used to be the helper of the distressed'\nZubayd: Transferred (diminutive of Zubd/Zabad etc.). Harmala: Transferred (plant).",

    "text": "So *Hudhayba* (a hill) is not hidden when evening comes ... nor is her feeding the dogs with her newborn lamb (*Sakhla*). She pierces its two teats with arrowheads (*Mashaqis*) ... while its placenta has dampened the dust. Sibawayh allowed in his saying 'A-Abdan' (A slave?!) that it be a vocative, or that it be accusative as a circumstantial state (*Hal*), as if he said: 'Do you boast while being a slave?' meaning in the state of his slavery, for boasting does not befit a slave! *Sha'bi*: A place. *Ghariban* (Stranger): Is accusative as an adjective for 'Abd' (slave), or as a *Hal* from the pronoun in 'Halla' (settled). And his saying: 'A-lu'man la aba laka, wa-ightiraban' (Meanness, no father for you, and estrangement?!): They are accusative based on two perspectives. First: That the estimation is 'A-tal'umu lu'man, wa taghtaribu ightiraban' (Do you act meanly with meanness, and become estranged with estrangement?), so they are verbal nouns (Masdar) made accusative by omitted verbs. Second: That the estimation is: 'A-tajma'u lu'man wa ightiraban' (Do you combine meanness and estrangement?), so you omit a single verb that acts upon both of them. This view is better to me than the first. The Alif in his saying 'A-lu'man' is the Alif of scolding and denial, like the one in the saying of Al-Ajjaj: 'A-taraban wa anta qinnasriyyu?! ... Wa innama ya'ti al-siba al-sabiyyu!' (Passion/Youthful joy while you are an old man?! ... Only the boy engages in youthful folly!). Abu al-Qasim recited in the chapter of the Two Nouns whose wording is one, and the second of them is annexed (*Mudaf*): 'O Taym of Taym of Adiy, no father for you (*La Aba Lakum*) ... Let not Umar meet you in a disgrace!' This verse is by Jarir, saying it to Umar bin Laja. The reason for that was that Jarir passed by Umar bin Laja while he was reciting an Urjuza poem of his, and people were around him listening. He stopped to listen. When he reached his saying: 'She arrived before the time of her mid-morning ... preying on snakes in her loose skin. Dragging with ease whoever doubts her ... the dragging of the old woman the sides of her tent.' Jarir said to him: 'You did poorly, and failed in what you said!' Umar said to him: 'So how should I say?' He said to him: 'Say: The dragging of the bride the folds of her sleeves.' Umar was embarrassed and said: 'You are in a worse state than me when you say: 'I am more protective of the reality for my people than you ... and more striking of the tyrant while the dust is rising. And more trustworthy near the *Murdafat* (women riding pillion) in the evening ... catching up when the sharp sword is drawn.'' Jarir had actually said: 'Near the *Murhafat*' (sharp swords/delicate women), but Umar narrated it: 'Near the *Mirdafat*.' Then he said to Jarir: 'They were taken in the morning, and you caught them in the evening. By God, you did not catch them until they had been married and exposed!' Jarir said: 'By God, this verse is dearer to me than my first-born virgin camel! But you plotted for Al-Farazdaq and turned it against me, and you shall know!' Then Jarir recited his poem in which he says: 'Clear the road for the one who builds the lighthouse in it ... and emerge in a duel where fate has compelled you. O Taym, Taym of Adiy, no father for you! ... Let not Umar meet you in a disgrace. You have not ceased speaking words that reach me ... the smell of the twisted rope, until the clay/townsfolk departed. Was it when you were *Samam* (deaf/poison), O Banu Laja ... and Mudar wagered on me regarding her lineages?!' Umar bin Laja answered him, saying: 'You have lied, and the worst speech is its most lying ... Mudar did not wager on you regarding her lineages. Are you not the leap of a weakling upon a slave girl ... Meanness and weakness do not win the races. Whatever you have said once, I will dismantle it ... O son of the female donkey, by the likes of me ropes are dismantled.' Then we turn to the explanation of the preceding poetry: 'Ya Tayma Tayma Adiyyin' (O Taym of Taym of Adiy) has two schools of thought: Sibawayh's school: The first *Taym* is annexed to Adiy, and the second *Taym* is an emphasis that intervened between the governor (genitive particle/construct) and the governed (genitive noun), like the intervention of 'Ma' in His Almighty's saying: 'Fa-bima rahmatin min Allahi linta lahum' (So by what mercy from God you were gentle with them). Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad's school: The first *Taym* is annexed to an omitted word indicated by what follows it, as if he said: 'Ya Tayma Adiyyin, Ya Tayma Adiyyin.' Al-Farra went towards something like this. So the vowel in the first *Taym* is a vowel of case declension (*I'rab*), and in the second *Taym* it is a vowel of following/alliteration (*Itba'*) according to Sibawayh's school. According to Abu al-Abbas's school, both vowels are vowels of case declension. Whoever believes that the two nouns together were made into one noun, like Hadramawt and Ba'labakk, and annexed to Adiy: the vowel of the first *Taym* would be a vowel of construction (*Bina'*), and the vowel of the second *Taym* would be a vowel of case declension. Al-Sirafi allowed it to be like 'Ya Zayd bin Amr', making the described noun with its adjective like one noun, so 'Zayd' in this view behaves like an explicative appositive (*Atf Bayan*) acting as an adjective. His saying: 'La Aba Lakum' (No father for you): 'La' is for acquittal (*Tabri'ah*), and its predicate is omitted, as if he said: 'No father for you exists in the world.' If you ask: What prevents 'Lakum' (for you) from being the predicate, so no omission is needed?",

    "text": "The answer is: What prevents that is the appearance of the Alif in 'Al-Ab' (the father); because the letters of prolongation and softness in 'Al-Ab'—and its sisters—are roots that only remain fixed in the state of annexation (*Idafa*). So due to the Alif, it must be annexed to the pronoun, and the Lam (L) becomes inserted as an emphasis for the annexation. If the matter is as we described, it becomes invalid for 'Lakum' to be the predicate. The prepositional phrase is only the predicate if the Alif is omitted and you say: 'La Aba Laka' (as distinct from *La Aba Laka* with the long vowel, though commonly written the same, the argument concerns the morphological form implying distinct constructs), just as Nahar bin Tawsi'ah al-Yashkuri said: 'Islam refused, no father for me other than it ... when they boasted of Qays or Tamim.' If a speaker says: How is it correct to say about this Lam: 'It is a redundant insertion (*Za'ida Muqhama*),' when if you said: 'La Aba Laka' (without intention of separation), it would not be permissible; because the 'Ab' would become definite by annexation to the pronoun, and 'La' does not govern the definite annexed noun? So if this Lam prepared the noun and fixed it so that 'La' could govern it, and reliance is upon it, how can it be said of something that is counted upon and relied upon: 'It is redundant'??! The answer is that the Lam is counted upon from the perspective that it prepared the noun for 'La' to govern it, and it is not counted upon from the perspective of confirming the Alif in 'Al-Ab'. If it is said: How is it correct to say of one thing: 'It is counted upon, and not counted upon'? Is this not like combining contradictories??! The answer is: It would only be considered combining contradictories if we said: 'It is counted upon' from one perspective, in one meaning. But if the perspectives differ, this objection of yours does not hold; because it is not denied that a thing can be counted upon from one perspective and not counted upon from another! If a speaker says: So when you say: 'La Aba li-Zaydin' (No father for Zayd), with what do you put Zayd in the genitive: by the annexation of 'Ab', or by the Lam? The answer is: The choice according to us is that it is in the genitive by the Lam, not by the annexation. The reason for that is: When two governors gather, and it is not permissible for Zayd to be governed by both of them—since two governors cannot act in one governed word, in one state, from one perspective—it was inevitable to suspend one of them from working and apply the other. Suspending the noun was more appropriate for two reasons: First: We have found nouns suspended from governing, as in their saying: 'Marartu bi-khayrin wa afdala min thamma' (I passed by one better and more excellent than there - *where 'better' doesn't govern strict genitive if separated*), and 'Qat'u yadin wa rijlin min khilafin' (Cutting of a hand and a foot from opposite sides), and Al-Farazdaq said: 'O you who saw a rain cloud for which I stayed awake ... between the arms and the forehead of the Lion (constellation).' We have not found a particle suspended from governing, even if it is redundant, except rarely, like the Ba in our saying: 'Laysa Zaydun bi-qa'imin' (Zayd is not standing) - it is redundant but has governed just as the non-redundant governs in: 'Marartu bi-Zaydin' (I passed by Zayd). Similarly, we said: 'Ma ja'ani min ahadin' (No one came to me): 'Min' has governed 'Ahad' even though it is redundant, just as the non-redundant governs in our saying: 'Kharajtu min al-dar' (I went out of the house). The second reason: The noun is stronger than the particle, and the stronger can bear suspension and omission that the weaker cannot bear. Ibn Jinni said this, and he allowed the first opinion, which is suspending the noun. It is possible for one who suspends the particle to say: We have found particles suspended in narration/imitation (*Hikayah*), like the saying of the Rajiz poet: 'Wallahi ma layli bi-nama sahibuhu ... wa la mukhaliti al-layyana janibuhu' (By God, my night is not one whose companion slept ... nor whose side mixed with softness - *where the case endings don't match standard negation governance*). Abu al-Qasim recited in the chapter of what is only permissible with the affirmation of the Ya: 'O daughter of my uncle (*Ya Ibnata 'Amma*), do not blame but sleep.' This verse is by Abu al-Najm al-Ijli. His name is: Al-Fadl bin Qudama. Qudama: An improvised name derived from 'Taqdim' (advancing) or 'Taqaddum' (precedence). Al-Fadl and Al-Najm are transferred names. After it is: 'Do not make me hear blame from you, but hear! ... Far, far away, and do not look. They are the Destinies, so blame or leave it ... Do not hope for my separation, do not hope!' It is narrated: 'Hiya al-Mulazim' (They are the Inseparable ones) - meaning the inseparable fates from which no one escapes! Abu al-Qasim recited in this chapter: 'O son of my mother (*Ya Ibna Ummi*) and O little brother of my soul (*Ya Shuqayqa Nafsi*) ... You have left me to a severe time.' This verse is narrated for Abu Zubayd al-Ta'i. His name is Harmala bin al-Mundhir, in a poem where he says: 'However, Al-Julah broke my wing ... the day I parted from him, at the highest highland. On the right of the road, near a thirsty owl ... calling in the night, unvisited. Thirsty, seeking relief, unrelieved ... and indeed, he was the refuge of the distressed.' Zubayd: Transferred name. It may be the diminutive of *Zabd* (gift), or diminutive of *Zubd* (butter), or diminutive of the foam (*Zabad*) that tops water, or diminutive of *Zabid*, or *Mazbud*, or *Muzbid* - in the sense of trimmed diminutive (*Tarkhim*). Harmala: Also transferred from the singular of *Harmal* (Rue plant).",

    "text": "'The slanderers surrounded me and disturbed me... Oh people, [help against] the obeyed slanderer.'\n\nThis verse is by Qays bin Dharih, and we have mentioned his name previously. He had married Lubna, but his father detested it and ordered him to divorce her. He refused, so his father swore not to seek shade under a roof until he divorced her. Then he lay in the Ramda (scorching hot sand heated by the sun) and said: 'By Allah, I will not leave this spot until you divorce her or I die!' His people rebuked Qays for his father's rights and said: 'If your father dies in this state, it will be a disgrace upon you. So satisfy him by divorcing her, and you can seek his favor later to take her back.' So he divorced her unwillingly! Then he lost his mind, and his father regretted what he had done. Lubna's father refused [remarriage] and when asked to let him take her back, he refused and married her to another! So Qays said regarding that:\n'O my liver! My pain has returned to me... And the separation of Lubna was like mutilation'\n'The slanderers surrounded me and disturbed me... Oh people, [help against] the obeyed slanderer'\n'So I became, in the morning, blaming myself... For a thing that is not possible [to undo]'\n'Like a cheated one biting his hands... Who realized his loss after the sale'\n'In a house of loss I left you, Lubna... Thus the Gin (demons) guide to loss'\n'And we lived with the pleasure of life for a time... If only Time were a guardian for man'\n'But the gathering is destined for separation... And the causes of death have their callers'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'A distant stranger far from home weeps for you... Oh middle-aged men and youths, for the wonder!'\nThis verse: I do not know its author. 'An-Na'i': The distant one. He meant here: his distance in lineage, because he mentioned the distance of his place from his place! He described 'Na'in' (distant one), which is indefinite, with 'Ba'id ad-dar' (far of house), which is added to a definite, because its addition implies separation, for 'Ad-Dar' is the subject in meaning, even if it is genitive in wording, because the estimation is: 'Ba'idun daruhu'. He says: The stranger weeps for you, while the close relative rejoices at your death, and that is one of the wonders, as the other said:\n'The stranger weeps for him, not knowing him... While the relative in the tribe is happy!'\nHe sought help (Istighatha) from them, just as he sought help from the middle-aged men. He put a kasra on the Lam of 'Ash-Shubban' because the origin of this Lam is kasra, and it was opened [in the first noun] to distinguish between the one whose help is sought and the one for whom help is sought. When one noun was coordinated with the other, it was known that it falls under its ruling, because the property of 'Waw' (and) is to share between the coordinated and the one coordinated upon in wording and meaning, so that sufficed instead of opening it, thus he brought it on the original form. This is not in every place, but only where the vocative particle is not repeated, like saying: 'Ya la-Zaydin wa li-Amrin wa li-l-'ajabi'. If you repeat the vocative particle, you say: 'Ya la-Zaydin wa Ya la-Amrin' - opening both, because the speech becomes two sentences. The poet said regarding repetition:\n'Oh for my people, who is for high ranks and endeavors... Oh for my people, who is for generosity and tolerance'\n'Oh for 'Attaf and Oh for Riyah... And for Abu al-Hashraj, the generous youth'\nIt is narrated: 'Wa Abi al-Hashraj' [without repetition of Ya].\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'O Harith bin Ka'b, do no dreams (minds) restrain you... from us, while you are of the hollow, weak ones (Al-Jamakhir)?!'\nThis verse is by Hassan bin Thabit, and I have mentioned his name previously. The reason for saying this poem was that An-Najashi mocked Banu al-Najjar from the Ansar with a poem saying:\n'You are not, Banu al-Najjar, equals like us... So go away from us, there, go away!'\n'If you wish, we will compete with you citing your father... Against whomever you wish from Tihama or Najd'\n'Was there not among us one who blows the bellows with his backside... As if on his cheeks is the dust of antimony?!'\nThe Ansar said to Hassan bin Thabit: 'O Abu al-Walid, will you mock An-Najashi?' He said: 'Where do you stand regarding the two sons of Abd al-Rahman?' They said: 'We wanted you, for Abd al-Rahman answered him but achieved nothing!' Hassan jumped and hit him [An-Najashi] with the door, splitting his eyebrow. He said: 'In the name of Allah, O Allah, compensate your Messenger today.' Then he recited his poem saying:\n'O Banu al-Himas, is there no noble one among you... Indeed chivalry in Al-Himas is little'\nThen he said: 'By Allah, I have not fulfilled what he said!!' Then he said: 'Listen:\nO Harith bin Ka'b, do no dreams (minds) restrain you... from us, while you are of the hollow, weak ones (Al-Jamakhir)?!'",

The entrances of filth, knowledgeable of wicked women'\n'Indeed, expelling Al-Farazdaq from among you... Would be a purification for what is between the Prayer Place and Waqim'\n\nThe nobles of Medina gathered to Marwan bin al-Hakam, who was its governor, and said to him: 'It is not proper that such poetry be recited among the wives of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he has obligated the Hadd punishment upon himself!!' Marwan said: 'I will not punish him myself, but I will write to one who will punish him.' So Marwan ordered him to leave Medina and gave him a deadline of three days. Regarding that, Al-Farazdaq says:\n'He threatened me and gave me a deadline of three... Just as Thamud was promised their destruction'\nThen he wrote a letter for him to his agent, ordering him to punish and imprison him, while misleading him that he wrote for a prize! Then Marwan regretted what he did! So he sent a messenger to him saying: 'I have composed a poem, so hear it.' He recited:\n'Say to Al-Farazdaq, and foolishness is its cup... If you are leaving what I ordered you, then sit'\n'And leave Medina, for it is blamed... And aim for Mecca or Jerusalem'\n'And if you avoid great matters... Then take for yourself the best dwellings!'\nAl-Farazdaq understood what he intended, so he threw the scroll and said:\n'O Marwan, indeed my mount is detained... Hoping for the gift, and its owner has not despaired'",

    "text": "'And you gifted me a sealed scroll... You fear for me regarding it the gift of Al-Niqras (calamity/trap)'\n'Throw the scroll, O Farazdaq, do not let it be... An evil like the scroll of Al-Mutalammis'\nHe went out fleeing until he came to Sa'id bin al-As, and with him were Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, peace be upon them, and Abdullah bin Ja'far. He told them the news, so each of them ordered him a hundred dinars and a mount, and he headed to Basra. It was said to Marwan: 'You erred in what you did; for you exposed your honor to the poet of Mudar!!' So he sent a messenger after him with a hundred dinars and a mount, fearing his satire!\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Leave me to a tiring worry, O Umayma... And a night I endure, slow of stars'\nThis verse is from the famous poetry of An-Nabigha adh-Dhubyani. He was nicknamed Abu Umamah and Abu Aqrab, after two daughters he had. There is disagreement on why An-Nabigha was named Nabigha. It is said: He was named so because he composed poetry after he became old - it is said 'Nabagha ar-rajul' if he didn't say poetry then said it. It is said: He was named Nabigha for his saying:\n'A distant intention has distanced Su'ad from you... So she spent the night while the heart is held hostage by her'\n'And she settled among Banu al-Qayn bin Jasr... For affairs have appeared (nabaghat) to us from them'\nIt is said: Derived from 'Nabaghat al-hamamah' (the pigeon cooed) if it sang. Al-Riyashi said this. Ibn Wallad narrated that he said: 'Naba'a al-ma' wa nabagha' (water welled up). As if they meant: He has a supply of poetry that does not run out, like the supply of welling water! 'An-Nasib': The tiring one. The analogy was to say 'Munsib', as Tufayl said: 'Ta'annaka nasbu man Umayyata munsibu'. But it came with the meaning of relation, or by deleting the addition from the verb, as said: 'Awrasa ash-shajaru fahuwa waris' (The tree leafed so it is leafy), and 'Abqala al-makanu fahuwa baqil' (The place sprouted herbs so it is herbal). His saying 'Bati' al-kawakib': He meant that the night, due to its length, makes the one awake in it imagine that its stars do not move!\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Banu Amir said: Leave (Khalu) Banu Asad... Oh misery for ignorance, harmful to peoples!'\nThis verse is from the famous poetry of An-Nabigha. 'Khalu Banu Asad': Abandon them. It is said: 'Khala ar-rajulu ahlahu', if he divorced her. Dhubyan wanted to oppose Banu Amir, so Banu Amir said: We will not oppose you until you leave the alliance between you and Banu Asad. So An-Nabigha attributed ignorance to them in what they said, and informed them that this would not happen; for that would harm them with Banu Asad and make them hateful towards them. 'Diraran' is accusative as a state (Hal). The Lam in 'Ya bu'sa li-l-jahli' is inserted (extra). We said previously regarding Jarir's poetry 'La abalakum': That the choice is for the Lam to be the preposition, not the addition (Idafa), even if it is extra. We said there what suffices repeating here, so refer to it you will see it, God willing!\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Oh misery for the war that put down... groups (Arahit), so they rested'\nThis verse is by Sa'd bin Malik al-Qaysi, saying it during the War of Basus when war raged between Bakr and Taghlib due to the killing of Kulayb. Al-Harith bin Abbad withdrew from the war, saying: 'This is a matter in which I have no she-camel nor camel.' He remained withdrawn until Muhalhil killed his son Bujayr. When informed, he said: 'My son is a slain one of great blessing: If Allah reconciles the two sons of Wa'il through him, restrains their foolishness, and saves their blood!' 'As-Safah': Lightness and recklessness. Then he was told that when he killed him, he said: 'Die for the shoelace of Kulayb's sandal!' He did not believe that, and sent to Muhalhil saying: 'If you killed my son for your brother and accepted that as vengeance, I have accepted it; to extinguish this turmoil!' Muhalhil said: 'I only killed him for his sandal's shoelace!' At that, Al-Harith became angry. Al-Harith said to his mother: 'Bring back your loads so I can join you to your people, for who am I compared to what you are?', and it became a proverb! And he said:\n'Bring the tether of [the horse] An-Na'amah near to me... The war of Wa'il has conceived after being barren'\n'I was not one of its perpetrators, Allah knows... And indeed today I am burning in its heat'\n'No neighbor protected a slain one, nor did the group... Of Kulayb refrain from error'\n'Bring the tether of An-Na'amah near to me... Indeed the killing of the boy for a shoelace is expensive'\nHe returned to Bakr bin Wa'il and witnessed the war. It was the day Arabs call: The Day of Shaving (Yawm at-Tahaluq). Sa'd bin Malik had said - when Al-Harith withdrew from the war, exposing him and those who followed his path:\n'Oh misery for the war that... Put down groups so they rested'",

    "text": "'And war, there does not remain for its burning fire... Arrogance nor liveliness'\n'Except the steadfast youth in hardships... And the strong-hoofed horse'\n'Whoever turns away from its fires... Then I am the son of Qays, there is no departure [I will stay]'\n'It revealed its leg to us... And the pure [truth/milk] appeared to us from it'\nWhen the Day of Shaving ended, and the victory that day was for Bakr over Taghlib, Al-Harith said to Sa'd bin Malik: 'Do you see me among those whom war put down?' He said: 'No, but there is no perfume hidden after a bride!' It became a proverb. Meaning: If you don't help your people now, for whom are you saving your help?! Meaning of 'Wada'at arahita': Dropped them so they had no mention in this war, so they rested from enduring its evil and suffering its heat. 'Arahit': Plural of 'Raht'. 'Arahit' has been used based on 'Arhut', Ru'ba said: 'He is the humble one in number among his groups (Arhutih)'. Most grammarians consider 'Arahit' a plural of 'Raht' not by analogy. 'At-Takhayyul': Pride. 'Al-Marah': Activity. 'Jahimuha': Its fire. 'An-Najdat': Hardships. 'An-Na'amah': Name of Al-Harith bin Abbad's horse. 'Laqihat': Conceived. 'Al-Hiyal': When the stallion mates with the camel but she doesn't conceive. It is said: The war of Bakr and Taghlib before today was 'Hiyal' (barren), i.e., like the barren camel, so today it became like the fertile one! He used this as a metaphor for what is born of war, of matters that were not calculated! Then Al-Harith bin Abbad swore not to make peace with Taghlib until the earth spoke to him!! When his assaults on Taghlib increased, and Taghlib saw they could not resist him, they dug a tunnel under the earth, put a man in it, and told him: When Al-Harith passes by you, sing this poetry:\n'O Abu Mundhir, you have annihilated, so spare some of us... Mercy! Some evil is lighter than others'\nWhen Al-Harith passed that spot, the man broke into song in the tunnel with this verse. It was said to Al-Harith: 'Your oath has been fulfilled, so spare the rest of your people.' And he did!\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of What Poets Truncated (Rakhkhamu) Outside of Vocative by Necessity:\n'Have not your ropes become rotten (Rimam)... And Umama has become distant (Shasi'ah) from you'\nThis verse is by Jarir bin al-Khatafi. He meant by 'Al-Hibal' (Ropes): The covenants and connection that were between them. 'Rimam': Plural of 'Rimm', which is the piece of worn-out rope. 'Ash-Shasi'ah': The distant. This is how Sibawayh recited it as evidence for the permissibility of truncation (Tarkhim) in poetic necessity according to the dialect of those who say: 'Ya Har' with a kasra on the Ra. Abu al-Abbas Muhammad bin Yazid claimed he read to 'Umara bin Aqil bin Bilal bin Jarir: 'Wa ma 'ahdun ka-'ahdiki ya Umama', which contains no necessity. After this verse:\n'Mu'jadat (strong camels) cross the trackless desert with it... And every strong camel that clears away the foam'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Is there no excuse/distraction for this Time... Against the people? Whatever it wills with the people, it does!'\n'And this is my cloak, it borrows it with him... To rob me of my soul, O Mali bin Hanzal'\nThis poetry is by Al-Aswad bin Ya'fur at-Tamimi. Al-Aswad: Name transferred from 'Al-Aswad' which is opposite of white, or 'Al-Aswad' meaning the snake, or 'Al-Aswad' meaning the core of the heart or pupil of the eye. Ya'fur: Transferred from future tense of 'Afara', like 'Yashkur' from 'Shakara'. It is said: 'Afartu az-zar'a' if you watered it first, 'Afartu an-nakhla' if you pollinated it, 'Afartu ar-rahla' in dust, and 'Afura ar-rajulu' (with damma on Fa) 'afaratan' if he became wicked and changed. It has three dialects: Ya'far (fatha on Ya, damma on Fa), Ya'fir (damma on Ya, fatha on Fa - unlikely, probably Ya'fir is Ya-open Fa-kasra, correction needed based on context or standard morphology, usually Ya'fur/Ya'fir), and Yu'fur. Whoever says Yu'fur (damma on Ya and Fa) declines it (makes it triptote), and in the other two ways it is diptote. Whoever narrates 'Ala ma li-hadha ad-dahri min muta'allili' breaks the Lam because it is the active participle of 'Ta'allala'. Whoever narrates: 'Ala hal...' opens the Lam of 'Muta'allal' because it is a source like 'At-Ta'allul'. He meant by 'Ar-Rida' (cloak) here: Youth. He says: Time takes my youth and compensates me with old age to lead me thereby to senility and death! Like Imru' al-Qays said:\n'To the root of the earth my roots have intertwined... And this death robs me of my youth'\n'Min muta'allili': In the narration 'Ala ma li-hadha ad-dahri', 'Min' here is estimated with the specification (Tamyiz). If dropped, the noun is accusative, like the other said:\n'O horseman, what a horseman you are... Trodding the sides, wide of arm span!'",

    "text": "If 'Min' were dropped, you would say: 'Ala ma li-hadha ad-dahri muta'allalan' - and 'Ya farisan ma anta farisan'. If the accusative appears, it is possible to be Tamyiz (specification) or Hal (state).\nAs for the one who narrates: 'Ala hal li-hadha ad-dahri min muta'allal' - with fatha on Lam, 'Al-Muta'allal' is a source meaning 'At-Ta'allul', and 'Min' is extra like its addition in your saying: 'Hal li-Zaydin min khurujin?'. The place of the genitive word is nominative by inchoation (Mubtada).\nHis saying: 'Yasta'iruhu': A sentence in the place of Hal (state) from the Ha, which is the pronoun of 'Ad-Dahr' (Time), or from the pronoun of 'Ar-Rida' (cloak) hidden in the adverb, because the meaning is 'Settled with him in this state'. If it is a state from 'Ad-Dahr', it is a state flowing on what it belongs to. If it is a state from the pronoun of 'Ar-Rida', it is a state flowing on other than what it belongs to. If you made it a single noun, you would say if it was a state from Time: 'Musta'irahu' (borrowing it), so the subject does not appear. If it was from the pronoun of the cloak, you would say: 'Musta'irahu huwa' (borrowed by it [time]), so you show the subject pronoun.\nHis saying: 'Indahu' (With him): If you wish, make it in the place of Raf' (nominative), as you say: 'Hadha Zaydun muntaliqun'. If you wish, in the place of Nasb (accusative), as you say: 'Hadha Zaydun muntaliqan', which is the preferred way.\nThe Lam in 'Li-yaslubani' is Lam of Kai (purpose/cause), attached to 'Al-Istiqrar' (the hidden existence) or to 'Yasta'iruhu'.\nIn his saying: 'Nafsi' (My soul/self): It can be a second object, or a substitute (Badal) for the pronoun; because 'Salb' (robbing) is sometimes used transitive to two objects, and sometimes to one object.\nIt is allowed in 'Amali' (O Mali - truncated form of Malik) to break the Lam on the dialect of 'Ya Har', and to open it on the dialect of 'Ya Zayd bin Amr'. This is only on the school of those who make the truncated noun after truncation like a noun standing by itself with nothing deleted.\nThe Lam in 'Li-hadha' is attached to a deleted element, because it is in the place of the predicate of the subject which is 'Ma'. It is like 'Ma li-Zaydin'.\nAs for the Ba in 'Bi-an-nasi', it can be attached to 'Sha'a' (willed), as you say: 'Aradtu bi-Zaydin al-khayra' (I intended good for Zayd). Or attached to 'Yaf'alu' (Does), as you say: 'Fa'altu bi-hi al-jamil' (I did the beautiful thing to him). A parallel to the first view is the poet's saying:\n'He intended for me that in which there is no good... But preventing hands stood between him [and it]'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'And the milk-camel's colt (young weakling), when tied in a rope... Cannot withstand the assault of the huge aged camels'\nThis verse is by Jarir bin al-Khatafi. The reason for saying it was: He entered upon Al-Walid bin Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, while Adi bin ar-Riqa' al-Amili was reciting his poem starting with:\n'He recognized the dwellings by imagination and frequented them... After decay had encompassed their lands!'\nWhen he finished reciting the poem, Al-Walid said to him: 'Do you hear, O Ibn al-Khatafi?!' He said: 'Who is he, O Commander of the Faithful?' He said: 'Adi bin ar-Riqa' al-Amili.' Jarir said to him: 'Is he one of those about whom Allah said: \"Faces, that Day, will be humbled, working [hard] and exhausted. They will [enter to] burn in an intensely hot Fire\"?' Al-Walid said to him: 'May you have no mother! Do you say this about one who praises our living and eulogizes our dead?!!' Jarir said:\n'The reach of the Amili falls short of the heights... But the penis of the Amili is long?'\nAdi said: 'Did your mother inform you of its length, or are you a man who doesn't know what to say?!' Al-Walid said: 'Rather, he is a man who doesn't know what to say!' Jarir became angry. Adi said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, protect me from his tongue!' Al-Walid said - to Jarir -: 'By Allah, if you mention him in your poetry, I will saddle you and ride you until the poets mock you for it!!' So Jarir did not mention him in his poetry, but he alluded to him in his poem starting:\n'Greet Al-Hidamlah from Dhat al-Mawa'is... For the bend has become desolate, not inhabited'\nHe said in it:\n'Indeed, when the deluded poet provokes me... [He is like] a neighbor to a grave at Marran, buried'\n'He was squint-eyed, refusing [injustice], so he bequeathed to us... Trouble upon the people in his squint-eyed sons'\n'Refrain, for a base branch and an unplanted root... Will never vie in glory with Nizar'\n'The fungus of the soft ground cannot withstand... Between the two paths in the smooth deserts'\n'And the milk-camel's colt, when tied in a rope... Cannot withstand the assault of the huge aged camels'\n'Al-Hidamlah': From sand - according to Abu Ubayda - is what is thin and long. 'Al-Mawa'is': Smooth sands to tread on, singular 'Mi'as'. 'Harrabani': Provoked me/Angered me.",

    "text": "Marran: A place four stages from Mecca towards Basra, within the lands of Banu Tamim bin Murr. The meaning of being a neighbor to it: That he comes towards it, defending and shouting for his honor, taking pride in attributing himself to it, and boasting to people with it! 'Marmus': Buried. There is deletion in the speech; meaning: A neighbor to an owner of a buried grave, deleting the addition, because the grave is not described as buried. 'Al-Ashwas': The arrogant one who looks with one eye out of pride. 'Al-Abba'': One who refuses injustice greatly. 'Al-Qarqara': The level place of earth. 'Al-Bid': Deserts that destroy those who travel them, singular 'Bayda''. 'Al-Labun': The camel having milk. 'Luzza': Tied and bound. 'Al-Qaran': The rope with which a camel or bull is tied. 'Al-Buzl': Aged camels, singular 'Bazil'. The 'Bazil' among camels is like the 'Qarih' among horses. 'Al-Qana'is': Plural of 'Qin'as', which is huge. A parallel to this verse in meaning is the saying of Suhaym bin Wathil ar-Riyahi:\n'I excused the aged camels (Al-Buzl) from betting on me... So what is my concern with the two sons of Labun?'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited this verse:\n'We found Nahshal surpassed Fuqaym... Like the surplus of the Ibn Makhad (1-year old camel) over the weaned colt.'\nThis verse is by Al-Farazdaq. Nahshal and Fuqaym are two tribes. 'Ibn al-Makhad': The one whose mother became pregnant [again], so she is 'Makhad' (pregnant), which is in the second year of his birth. 'Al-Fasil': The one weaned from breastfeeding. There is no great difference between them, so he likened the difference between these two tribes to that. Many grammarians are fond of allowing 'Fadalat' (surpassed) in this verse with opening the Dad or breaking it, because linguists narrated that it is said: 'Fadala' and 'Fadila'. The two dialects are only regarding the 'Fadlah' (remainder/surplus) of a thing. It is said from that: 'Fadala yafdulu' on the pattern of 'Qa'ada yaq'udu', and 'Fadila yafdalu' like 'Sami'a yasma'u', and 'Fadula yafdulu' - with damma on Dad in past and future. 'Fadalat' mentioned in this verse is from their saying: 'Fadaltu ar-rajula fa-fadaltuhu', i.e., I defeated him in merit. The verb from this category - the category of overcoming and rivalry - is only open on the 'Ayn (middle radical), and it is regular in that.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'O many an envier of us, if he sought you ... He would meet distance from you and deprivation'\nThis verse is by Jarir bin al-Khatafi, and mention of it passed in the Chapter of the Active Participle.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Particles that Install Future Verbs:\n'I love black people for her love, to the point... I love black dogs for her love.'\nThis verse: I do not know its author. The speaker described that since his beloved was black, he loved everything black for her sake, as Ali bin Hisham said - when blamed for loving a black woman:\n'The mole is on an ugly face... And it clothes it with saltiness and beauty'\n'So how can a lover be blamed for one whom... He sees entirely as a mole in the eye?!'\nA contemporary poet has two verses reversing what this first one went to, saying:\n'I fell in love with a black woman despite her malice... So a garment of madness settled upon me'\n'My love for a black woman (Sawda') is the reverse of her name... Its beginning is evil (Saw'), and the rest is disease (Da')!'\n\nHis saying: 'Hatta uhibba': It is possible it is in the interpretation of the past, as Abu al-Qasim said, as if he said: 'Until I loved'. It is possible: That it is a verb of state (Hal) in the time he said the poetry, as if he said: 'I am now in this state', just as it is said: 'So-and-so became sick until they do not hope for him', i.e., until he is now not hoped for. The Lam in his saying 'Li-hubbiha' is attached to 'Uhibbu', and it is the Lam of cause and reason, and it has no grammatical place because it is attached to an apparent word.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of 'Aw' (Or):\n'So I said to him: Let your eye not weep, for we only... Attempt a kingdom or die so we are excused.'\nThis verse is from the famous poetry of Imru' al-Qays, and its fame suffices us from mentioning discussion on it. It is narrated: 'Fa-nu'dhara' - with fatha on Dhal - i.e., people excuse us, and 'Nu'dhira' with kasra on Dhal - i.e., we present an excuse.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of 'Waw':\n'Do not forbid a behavior and [then] do the like of it... Disgrace upon you, if you do, is great.'\nPeople differed on the author of this poem. Some narrate it for Al-Akhtal. Some narrate it for Al-Mutawakkil al-Laythi. Some narrate it for Abu al-Aswad ad-Du'ali, which is the most affirmed narration. After it:\n'And start with yourself and forbid it from its error... If it desists from it, then you are wise'\n'And there, what you say will be heard, and followed... Is the action from you, and teaching will be beneficial!!'",

    "text": "Abu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Wearing a woolen cloak while my eye is cool (happy)... Is dearer to me than wearing sheer robes'\nThis verse is by Maysun bint Bajdal al-Kalbiyyah. Maysun and Bajdal are improvised names. As for Bajdal: I do not know a derivation for it. As for Maysun: It might be derived from 'Masannahu bi-s-sawt masnan', if he hit him, so its Meem is original, its Waw is extra, and its pattern is 'Fay'ul'. It might be derived from 'Masa yamisu' if he strutted, so the derivation of Maysun - for a woman - and Maysan - for the town - would be from one root. The most likely is that it is from 'Masana', because deriving it from 'Masa' requires the Nun in Maysun to be extra, and the Ya original, so its weight would be 'Fa'lun', and 'Sa'nun' and 'Fa'lun' is strange with no parallel known, except their saying: 'Zaytun' (Olive), for a group of grammarians argued for the addition of Nun in it due to the oil (Zayt) pressed from it, and some linguists narrated: 'Ard Zaytiyyah', if it had olives, which necessitates its weight be 'Fay'ul'.\n'Al-Aba'ah' and 'Al-Abayah': The cloak/jubbah. 'Ash-Shufuf': Thin clothes through which what is behind is seen. Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan married this Maysun, brought her from the desert, and made her one of his favorites, but she hated him for his old age and senility, so she said this verse. After it:\n'Indeed a house in which winds flutter... Is dearer to me than a lofty palace'\n'Indeed a dog barking at guests at midnight... Is dearer to me than a friendly cat'\n'Indeed a beardless youth from the youth of Banu Kilab... Is dearer to me than a violent sheikh'\nSo Muawiyah divorced her and said: 'Join your family!'\nThe estimation of this verse: 'Is dearer to me than wearing sheer robes', without 'happiness of my eye', so she deleted that because the meaning of the speech indicated it.\nIt is narrated that an old man approached a woman, and she said to him: 'I do not ride a gray horse (Ashhab)!!' An old man wrote to a literate woman proposing to her! - and he was gap-toothed, long-toothed - so she wrote back to him, signing on the back of his letter: 'Fear Allah regarding my blood, O one with the beautiful smile!'.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter: From the Issues of Fa:\n'Did you not ask the empty quarter so it speaks... And does the smooth desert inform you today?'\nThis verse is by Jamil bin Ma'mar al-Udhri. Jamil, Ma'mar, and Udhrah are all transferred names. Jamil: The beautiful of everything. Al-Jamil: Fat/Grease. Abu Khurash said:\n'We meet their hunger with crowned [bowls]... Of huge loaf bread, greased by fat (Al-Jamil)'\n'Ar-Ra'ib': Fat/Grease. Al-Ma'mar: The place of habitation. Ma'mar: A specific place name. 'Udhrah' - of a girl: The closing of her vagina before marriage. 'Al-'Udhrah': Forelock hair. Imru' al-Qays said:\n'She has locks (Udhar) like the horns of women... Fixed on a day of wind and cold'\n'Ar-Rab'': The dwelling where it was. 'Al-Marba'': The dwelling specifically. 'Al-Qawa'': Empty. 'Al-Bayda'': The desert that destroys who travels it. 'As-Samlaq': That which has nothing in it. The meaning of 'Nutq ar-rab'' (speech of the quarter): What is evident from its traces. Arabs call every evidence 'Nutq' (speech) and 'Qawl' (saying). Thus Allah Almighty said: 'This Our Record speaks about you in truth.' From this is Zuhair's saying:\n'Is it from Umm Awfa, a trace that did not speak... At Hawmanat ad-Darraj, then Al-Mutathallam?'\ni.e., no speech or trace of news appeared from it; due to the age of the dwelling. Like saying: Have you not stood at the gardens and said: Who made your rivers flow, planted your trees, and harvested your fruits?! If they answer you not in dialogue, they answer you in consideration! Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri went to this meaning saying:\n'Do you reckon the full moon is not a speaker... eloquent, and that the sun does not speak?!'\n'Indeed, everything that is fleeting has told us... But we are in a world that does not know!'\n\nAfter Jamil's verse:\n'Or it returns the saying: A house, as if... The length of its decay and aging is a parchment'\n'I stood at it until my blindness cleared... And the trained Arhabi camel became weary of standing'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter: From the Issues of Idha:\n'If Abd al-Aziz returns to me with the like of it... And enables me to have her, then I will not cancel it'\nThis verse is by Kuthayyir 'Azza al-Khuza'i. Abd al-Aziz - here - is Abd al-Aziz bin Marwan, father of Umar bin Abd al-Aziz. Kuthayyir 'Azza had praised him, and he liked his poetry, so he said: 'Ask your need!' He said: 'Make me in the place of your scribe Ibn Rummanah!' He said: 'Woe to you! That is a scribe, and you are a poet' - and considered him foolish.!",

    "text": "It is said: Rather, he offered him a slave girl to give to him, provided he leave flirting with 'Azza. He refused that, then regretted what he did, and recited his poem saying:\n'Indeed the son of Layla uttered to me a saying... And if I had proceeded in it, I would be among those who attain it'\n'When I considered matters, and his advice... Appeared, I bid farewell to it and its heavy consequences'\n'I wondered at my leaving a plan of rectitude after... Its acceptance appeared to me from Abd al-Aziz'\n'And indeed I tame the difficult matters... And on that day, their easy one was possible for me'\n'I swore by the Lord of the camels trotting to Mina... Their pace and quick walk traversing the lands'\n'If Abd al-Aziz returns to me with the like of it... And enables me to have her, then I will not cancel it'\n'So are you, if I return the saying to you once... With better than it, returning and granting it?!'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter: Issues of the Lightened 'An' Installing the Verb:\n'So I said to them: Assume [the presence of] two thousand heavily armed men... Their leaders in Persian woven mail'\nThis verse is by Duraid bin as-Simma. Duraid: A transferred name, possibly from 'Dard' - which is loss of teeth, or diminutive of 'Adrad' by truncation. As-Simma: Transferred name also from 'As-Simma' - meant as the lion - and As-Simma is also: The brave one.\nThis verse is from a poem mourning his brother: Abdullah. He had raided Ghatafan, took spoils, and returned. When he reached Munqata' al-Liwa, he camped. Duraid said to him: 'This is not a place to camp, for the owners of this spoil will not cease coming to you and seeking you!' Abdullah said to him: 'I will not leave until I prepare food (antaqi'), mix beverage (artasi'), and distribute arrows (divide spoils)!' Duraid could not disobey him, so he ordered a scout (Rabi'ah), who climbed a high ground, and said to him: 'Look and tell us what you see.' He stayed a while, then said: 'I see horses, upon them are men like boys, their spears between the ears of their horses!' Abdullah said: 'This is Fazara, and there is no harm!' Then the scout said: 'I see a people as if their clothes were dipped in red ochre (Ja'b).' Abdullah said: 'This is Ashja', and it is nothing!' 'Al-Ja'b': Red ochre. Then the scout said: 'I see a black people shaking the earth, their mounts are their blackness, dragging the earth with their feet and spears!' Abdullah said: 'This is Abs, and violent death has come! So ride!' The people caught up, and fought a fierce battle. Dhu'ab bin Asma' aimed at Abdullah and stabbed him, so he fell to the ground and called for help from his brother Duraid. Duraid advanced, defended him for a while and drove the horses away, but Duraid was stabbed and felled, Abdullah was killed, his companions defeated, and the spoils recovered. Duraid said - and this day is called Day of Al-Liwa -:\n'And I said to Arid and the companions of Arid... And the group of Banu as-Sawda', and the people are witnesses'\n'And I said to them: Indeed the allies are all... Sitting at the water of Al-Bulayl, resting'\n'And I said to them: Assume [the presence of] two thousand heavily armed men... Their leaders in Persian woven mail'\n'So when they disobeyed me, I was one of them, though I see... Their error, or that I am not guided!'\n'I commanded them my command at Mun'araj al-Liwa... But they did not recognize the right path until the noon of the next day'\n'And am I but of Ghawiyyah; if it errs... I err, and if Ghawiyyah is guided, I am guided'\n\n'Al-Mudajjaj': Heavily armed. It is said with kasra on Jim and fatha. Some linguists differentiated: Mudajjij (kasra) is the knight, Mudajjaj (fatha) is the horse; because they used to armor horses. He meant by 'Farisi': Armor made in Persia. 'Al-Musarrad': Woven with rings. 'Saratuhum': Their nobles, singular 'Sari'. It seems to be the plural of 'Sarin', because it is said 'Sara ar-rajulu yasri wa yasru' if he became noble. The active participle of 'Sara' is 'Sarin', as 'Ghaza' is 'Ghazin'. The active participle of 'Saruwa Yasru' is 'Sariyy', like 'Zharufa' is 'Zharif'. The poet said:\n'You meet the noble (Sariyy) of men when he travels... And the son of the noble when he travels, his night travel'\nThe analogy was to say: 'Suratuhum' - with damma on Sin - as 'Qudah' and 'Ghuzah'. 'Fa'il' is not pluralized as 'Fa'lah' with open Fa, except what is sound like 'Kafir/Kafarah', or weak-eyed like 'Kha'in/Khawanah', 'Ha'ik/Hawakah', 'Ha'iz/Hawazah'. But they treated the weak-lam like the weak-ayn due to their agreement in vowel change. It is narrated: 'Surah' - with damma on Sin.",

    "text": "It is permissible that 'Sarah' is the plural of 'Sariyy', and it was allowed to break 'Fa'il' into 'Fa'lah': because 'Fa'il' and 'Fa'il' share one meaning; it is said 'Alim' and 'Alim', 'Qadir' and 'Qadir'; so they shared in their plural as they shared in their singular, as they said 'Alim/Ulama'' and 'Sha'ir/Shu'ara''. The category of 'Fa'la'' in plural is indeed 'Fa'il', like 'Hakim/Hukama'' and 'Basir/Busara''. It is said: 'Sarah' is a collective noun (Ism Jam'). The proponent of this argued with their saying: 'Sarawatuhum qisar' (Their backs are short), like 'Qatah/Qatawat'. The argument of those who went to the first view: The plural may be pluralized.\nThe Ba in 'Bi-alfay mudajjaj' attaches to 'Zhannu', so it has no grammatical place as it attaches to an apparent word. As for the Ba in 'Bi-l-Farisi'; if you believe 'Saratuhum' is a subject (Mubtada) and 'Bi-l-Farisi' is its predicate, the Ba attaches to a deleted element and has a place, as if he said: 'Their leaders are armored with the woven Persian'. If you believe 'Saratuhum' is raised by 'Mudajjaj', the Ba attaches to 'Mudajjaj', and has no grammatical place as it attaches to an apparent word. Whoever believes this raises 'Saratuhum' as the object whose agent is not named (passive subject) if opening the Jim, and as the agent (subject) if breaking the Jim, as if he said: 'With two thousand Persian [armored], and their noses were armored with the Persian', deleting the object as An-Nabigha al-Ja'di said:\n'Until we caught up to them, our horsemen make run (Tu'di)... As if we were the spur of a hill raising the mirage'\nHe meant: Our horsemen make the horses run. This has been mentioned before.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Verbs of Appropinquation (Af'al al-Muqarabah):\n'Perhaps the distress I have ended up in... Behind it will be a near relief'\nThis verse is by Hudba bin al-Khashram al-Udhri. Hudba and Khashram are both transferred names. As for Hudba: It is from 'Hudb' of a garment, or 'Hudb' of the Arta tree, which is its leaves. The common term for Arta is to say: 'Hudbah' and 'Hudb', like 'Shajarah' and 'Shajar'. However, Ibn Jinni narrated it is said: 'Hudb' on the pattern of 'Hudb' of a garment. Al-Khashram: A group of bees, having no singular from its wording. Ibn Jinni recited for Ash-Shanfara:\n'When the sent bees (Khashram) urged their swarm... Buzzing ones, thrown down by a honey-gatherer'\nHudba recited this poetry while imprisoned in Medina. The reason was: An altercation occurred between him and a man from his cousins: Ziyad bin Zayd, so Hudba killed him. His brother Abd al-Rahman took him to Muawiyah. Muawiyah questioned him. He said: 'If you wish I answer you in prose, and if you wish I answer you in verse.' Muawiyah said: 'Rather in verse, for it is more enjoyable!' So he recited a poem saying:\n'We shot and shot back, so our arrow encountered... Deaths of men in a book and in a decree'\n'And you are the Commander of the Faithful, so we have... No turning away from you nor falling short'\n'If it [the blood money] is in our wealth, we are not distressed by it... An arm's length, and if it is patience [execution], we are patient for patience'\nMuawiyah said: 'I see you have confessed to killing their companion!' He said: 'It is what you heard!' Muawiyah offered Abd al-Rahman the blood money to accept it, and the elders of Quraysh offered him seven blood monies, but he refused to accept! The killed Ziyad had a son named Al-Miswar who had not reached puberty. Muawiyah said: 'His son is more entitled to seek his blood, so let Hudba be imprisoned until his son comes of age, perhaps he will accept the blood money.' He was imprisoned for seven years until Al-Miswar reached puberty. The blood money was offered to him, but he refused anything but killing Hudba! A man from his relatives named Abu Numayr visited Hudba during his detention and showed sorrow for his state. Hudba said:\n'The depression of Abu Numayr keeps me awake... And my heart is depressed from his depression'\n'So I said to him: May Allah guide you, gently... And the best speech is the possessor of the correct mind!'\n'So a fearful one may become safe, and a captive released... And the strange man may come to his family'\n'For we have settled in a house of tribulation... The fates will strike us or afflict [us]'\n'Oh would that the winds were subjected... For our need, coming early or returning'\nIt is narrated: 'Amsayta' (You ended up) with fatha on Ta addressing Abu Numayr, and 'Amsaytu' (I ended up) with damma on Ta reporting about himself. 'Kana' in this verse is complete (Tammah), having no predicate, because it means: occurs and happens. Most say: He deleted 'An' from the predicate of 'Asa' likening it to 'Kada'. My opinion is better: That 'Asa' was likened to 'La'alla' (Perhaps); because each is hope and expectation, just as they sometimes insert 'An' in the predicate of 'La'alla' likening it to 'Asa', as Mutammim bin Nuwayra said:",

    "text": "'Perhaps you, one day, a calamity will befall... Of those that leave you with a cut nose'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'It almost, from the length of decay, became effaced'\nThis verse is attributed to Ru'ba bin al-Ajjaj, but I did not find it in Ru'ba's poetry. Ru'ba: Transferred name, having eleven meanings which I mentioned in the book 'Al-Iqtidab' and 'Al-Muthallath'. Al-Ajjaj: Transferred name; because Al-Ajjaj is the stirrer of dust (Ajaj). It is said: Al-Ajjaj is for the one who cries out a lot (Ajij). It is said he was named Al-Ajjaj for his saying:\n'Until whoever cried out (Aj'aja) cries out at it'\n'Yamsaha': Its traces are obliterated. Describes a dwelling that decayed until almost no trace was visible.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter: The Object Carried on Meaning:\n'Like hedgehogs, shuffling, [their shame] has reached... Najran, or their disgraceful deeds reached Hajar'\nThis verse is by Al-Akhtal. His name is Ghiyath bin Ghawth, according to Ibn Qutayba. Others mentioned his name is Ghuwayth bin Ghawth. These are transferred names. His Kunya is Abu Malik, also transferred; because Abu Malik is the Kunya of hunger, old age, and the elder. The poet said:\n'A miserable companion is a decrepit elder... Umm Ubayd, and Abu Malik'\nUmm Ubayd: Kunya of the desert. Another said:\n'O Abu Malik, the beautiful women have abandoned me... O Abu Malik, I think you are diligent [in pursuing me]'\nAl-Akhtal: Name transferred from their saying: 'Rajulun Akhtal', if he has long ears, or is foul-mouthed. It is said he was nicknamed so because the two sons of Ju'ayl and their mother disputed and sought his judgment, so he said:\n'By your life, I, and the two sons of Ju'ayl... And their mother, are surely low bottoms'\nThey said to him: 'You are indeed Akhtal (foul/long-eared)', so it stuck to him! This verse is from a poem mocking Jarir, saying before this verse:\n'As for Kulayb bin Yarbu', they have no... Entering or leaving when boasting'\n'Left behind, and people pass their affair... While they are absent and in blindness of what they perceived'\nHe likened them to hedgehogs for their walking at night for theft and debauchery, as hedgehogs walk. The hedgehog is proverbial for night travel. It is said: 'He travels by night more than a hedgehog', and 'more than Anqad' - which is the hedgehog. 'Haddajun': Shufflers/Walkers. It is said 'Hadaja yahdiju' if he hurried. The source: 'Hadaj' and 'Hadajan'. Al-Ajjaj said describing the male ostrich:\n'And his traces were replaced by a swift one... Knock-kneed, shaking, never ceasing to shuffle'\ni.e., frightened. 'As-Saw'at': Ugly deeds. Najran and Hajar: Towns. The norm was to raise 'As-Saw'at' (Subject) because they reach the towns, towns do not reach them. He inverted it out of necessity when the meaning was understood. The apparent meaning of Abu al-Qasim's words is that he considered the necessity only in 'Hajar', because he said: 'So he inverted, because the disgrace reaches Hajar, so he installed it and raised Hajar.' Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad recited it raising both Najran and Hajar, saying: Make the two verbs for the two towns by expansion - and this is the correct view!\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'The morning a stab by Husayn permitted for Ibn Asram... The fat fresh meats and the wine'\nThis verse is by Al-Farazdaq. 'Al-Abit': Fresh meat. 'As-Sada'if': Fat of the hump etc., dominated by fat. Husayn bin Asram had a relative killed, so he forbade himself wine and fresh meat until he killed his killer. When he stabbed and killed him, wine and meat became lawful for him. It should have been raised (permitted *by* the stab), and install 'Al-Abitat' and 'Al-Khamr' (permitted *the* meats/wine). But the poem has nominative rhymes, so he was forced to invert the speech. Al-Farazdaq said regarding this:\n'And [horses] watered in the evening before the family, as if... They were locusts when dawn cleared the panic'\n'Roaming, never ceasing under their bellies... Are shirts of heroes whose gores are red'\n'They left the son of Dhu al-Jaddayn hiccuping, propped up... And he has no grave but his oleander tree'\n'And they at Sarhaf caught up with Daliq... Umara of Abs, after the afternoon waned'\n'And they, upon the cheeks of Shutayr bin Khalid... Raised dust from their hooves, dark'\n'The morning a stab by Husayn permitted for Ibn Asram... The fat fresh meats and the wine'",

    "text": "He meant by 'Maghbuqa': Horses whose owners prefer them over their families, feeding them the 'Ghabuq' (evening drink) of milk etc. He meant by 'Ibn Dhu al-Jaddayn': Bistam bin Qays ash-Shaybani. Asim bin Khalifa ad-Dabbi killed him, and he fell on the 'Ala'ah' (oleander/rock), which is a small rock. Therefore Ibn Ghanma ad-Dabbi said:\n'He fell on the Ala'ah, not pillowed... As if his forehead was a polished sword'\n'Yanshiju': Blood coming out of his wound making a sound. 'Al-Musnad': One who nurses him and is gentle with his condition, checking for life. 'Daliq': Umara bin al-Wahhab al-Absi, nicknamed Daliq for his many raids. He killed him at Sarhaf ad-Dabbi.\nIt is narrated that Yunus bin Habib met Al-Kisa'i and said: 'O Abu al-Hasan, how do you narrate Al-Farazdaq's verse: \"Ghadat uhillat li-ibn Asrama ta'natu... Husaynin 'abitat as-sada'ifi wa al-khamr\"?' He said: 'I raise \"At-Ta'natu\" according to analogy, install \"Al-Abitat\", and cut \"Al-Khamru\" (start new sentence) carrying it on the meaning: as if he said: \"And wine became lawful for him.\"' Yunus said: 'How excellent is what you said, but Al-Farazdaq recited it to me inverted!'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'And the bite of time, O Ibn Marwan, has not left... Of wealth except what is eradicated (Mushatan) or stripped away (Mujallafu)'\nThis verse is by Al-Farazdaq, praising Abd al-Malik bin Marwan and mocking Jarir. Before it:\n'To you, O Commander of the Faithful, the concerns of hopes... And the trackless desert traveled without guidance have thrown us'\n'Al-Hawjal': The desert with no landmarks to guide. Abu at-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi went to this meaning saying:\n'Deserts, neighing horses, spearheads... Slim spears, threats and intimidation'\n'Al-Muta'assaf': Traveled without a guide. 'Al-'Add' and 'Al-'Att': Severity of time. 'Al-Mushat': Eradicated, with no remainder. 'Al-Mujallaf': Whose majority is gone, leaving a little. In this verse are three narrations, all necessities:\n1. Opening Ya and Dal of 'Yada'' (Yada'a - leave), installing 'Mushatan'.\n2. Opening Ya, breaking Dal, raising 'Mushatun'.\n3. Damma on Ya, opening Dal, raising 'Mushatun'.\nRegarding the first narration - mentioned by Abu al-Qasim, the famous one - there are four opinions:\n1. 'Mujallafu' is raised by a hidden verb indicated by 'Lam yada'' (did not leave), as if saying: 'Or remained stripped'.\n2. Al-Farra's view: 'Mujallafu' is a subject whose predicate is deleted: 'Or stripped is likewise'.\n3. Hisham from Al-Kisa'i: Coordinate it with the pronoun in 'Mushatan'.\n4. Found in Abu Ali al-Farisi's speech: Coordinated with 'Al-'Add'. He says it is a source in the form of a passive participle, as Allah says: 'And We tore them every tearing (Mumazzaq)', as if saying: 'And the bite of time, or stripping'.\nRegarding the narration breaking the Dal of 'Yada'' and raising 'Mushatun': He made it from 'Wada'a' (stayed/remained) in his house, so he is 'Wadi'', and raised 'Mushatun' with it. There is deletion: 'Because of it/its cause'.\nWhoever narrates opening Dal and damma on Ya - passive voice - raises 'Mushatun' also, as the deputy subject. He should have said 'Lam yuda'', but deleted the Waw as deleted from 'Yada''. We discussed this verse more in the first book.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'The snakes made peace with his foot... The viper (Uf'uwan) and the brave large snake (Shuja')'\n'And the one with two horns, silent, aged'\nThis Rajaz is by Musawir al-Absi. After it:\n'They murmured at his two legs when he slept... Then they went early and he became safe'\nMusawir: Transferred name, active participle of 'Sawarahu' if he leaped on him. He mocked a man for the thickness and hardness of his feet due to walking barefoot long; mentioning he treads on snakes and scorpions killing them, so they made peace with his feet for that! The analogy was to raise 'Al-Uf'uwan' and what follows as a substitute (Badal) for 'Al-Hayyat' (snakes). However, he carried it on a hidden verb indicated by 'Salama' (made peace); because making peace involves two or more. If you say 'Zayd made peace with Amr', it is known Amr made peace with him. As if he said: 'And the foot made peace with the viper'.\n'Al-Uf'uwan': Male viper. 'Ash-Shuja'': Male snake. Amr bin Sha's al-Asadi said:\n'He lowered his head like the lowering of the snake, and if... The snake saw a path for his fangs, he would bite'",

    "text": "'Ash-Shaj'am': The bold one. Or the long one (more likely derivation). 'Dhat qarnayn': The scorpion. 'Damuz': Silent/No sound. 'Dirzim' (kasra on Dad and Zay): Aged (more malicious poison). Al-Farra' narrated: 'Qad salamat al-hayyata' installing 'Al-Hayyat' as object, making 'Al-Qadam' the subject. He said he meant 'Al-Qadaman' (two feet) but deleted the dual Nun out of necessity, as Imru' al-Qays said:\n'She has two flesh-ridges (Matnatan) firm (Khazhata), as... The leopard crouched on its forearms'\nHe meant 'Khazhatan'. Evidence is Abu Du'ad al-Iyadi's saying:\n'And two flesh-ridges firm (Khazhatan)... Like the slope of a hill'\nHe substituted 'Al-Uf'uwan' and what follows for 'Al-Hayyat'. 'Hamhamna': Made sounds. 'Hamhamah': Hidden confusing sound. 'Hawwama': Slept.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter of Jussive (Jazm):\n'When you come to him, seeking the light of his fire... You find the best fire, at which is the best kindler'\nThis verse is by Al-Hutay'a - name mentioned previously - praising Baghid bin Ammar bin Shammas bin Lu'ay. Before it:\n'You visit a man who gives his wealth for praise... And whoever gives the prices of praises is praised'\n'He sees stinginess not leaving wealth for a man... And knows that man is not immortal'\n'An earner and a spender; if you ask him... He beams and shakes like the shaking of Indian swords'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Indeed, whoever enters the church one day... Will meet (Yalqa) therein wild calves and gazelles'\nThis verse is by Al-Akhtal. He was Christian, hence mentioning the church. 'Ja'adhir': Calves of wild cows, singular 'Ju'dhar' (damma or fatha on Dhal). Basrans don't recognize opening Dhal because 'Fa'lal' is unused for them. Kufans narrated many words on 'Fa'lal': 'Ju'dhar', 'Burqa'', 'Tuhlab', 'Difda'', 'Jakhdab'. He says: Whoever enters the church sees among Christian women those resembling wild calves and gazelles!!\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'And whatever nature a man possesses... Even if he thinks it hidden from people, it will be known (Tu'lami)'\nThis verse is from the famous poetry of Zuhair bin Abi Sulma. 'Al-Khaliqah': Nature. 'Khalaha': Thought/reckoned it. This poetry parallels Salim bin Wabisa:\n'O you who adorn yourself with other than your feature... Indeed affectation, true nature comes beneath it'\n'Min khaliqatin': In the place of Raf' (nominative) by 'Kana'. 'Min' is extra, not attached to anything. 'Wa in khalaha': i.e., Even if he thought it. 'In' is conditional with no answer; because 'Mahma' and its condition/answer sufficed. Parallel in hanging one condition on another is Imru' al-Qays:\n'And I was certain that if I met him, his day... At Dhu ar-Rimth - if I missed him - was a day of souls (death)'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'When you come to the Messenger, say to him:... A truth upon you when the assembly is at ease'\nThis verse is by Al-Abbas bin Mirdas as-Sulami. Al-Abbas: Transferred from the man who frowns much (Abus). Mirdas: Transferred; 'Mirdas' is the stone, 'Mirdas' is what is thrown/crashed with, or thrown in a well to determine water. Al-Ajjaj said:\n'He sheaths the enemies with a crushing head (Mirdasa)'\nHe meant by Messenger: The Prophet (PBUH). Narrated: 'Imma atayta'. After it:\n'O best of who rode mounts and who walked... Upon the dust when souls are counted'\n'Through you the tyrant submitted and followed guidance... And through you the intense dark darkness cleared from us'\n'Idha ma atayta': Addressing a man mentioned before:\n'O man who is carried by... A thick-cheeked, hard-hoofed, strong she-camel'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'So you have become such that however you approach it, you get entangled in it... Both its riding places are crooked (Shajir) under your legs'\nThis verse is by Labid bin Rabi'ah al-Amiri. Kunya: Abu Aqil. 'Al-Labid': Sack. 'Ar-Rabi'ah': Iron helmet.",

It is said: 'Arhaltu al-ba'ir wa akfaltuhu' - put saddle and Kifl on it. These are the two riding places mentioned. Meaning: He tells his uncle: You have embarked on a matter from which there is no escape. You are like one riding a difficult she-camel, unable to dismount safely because his legs are entangled in the stirrups. He cannot stabilize on either seat; if he rides the back (Kifl), he finds it hard; if the front (Rahl), it leans and throws him! 'Ash-Shajir': Leaning, not straight. Arabs liken engaging in grave matters to riding difficult mounts. They say: 'You rode a great matter from me', 'You rode a difficult mount', 'So-and-so is a rider of calamities'. Al-Asha said:\n'If the causes of severance become serious between us... You will depart from me on the back of a porcupine (Shayham)'\nAl-Akhtal said:\n'Qays bin Aylan has made our war... Upon a dry backbone, humped of back'\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'If our swords fall short, their connection is... Our steps towards our enemies, so we strike'\nThis verse is by Qays bin al-Khatim. We mentioned his and his father's name previously. From a poem mentioning the Day of Bu'ath. After it:\n'And the Day of Bu'ath, our swords handed it... To a lineage in the root of Ghassan, dominant'\n'They unsheathe white [swords] when we meet our enemy... And sheathe red ones, thin of blades'\nNarrated: 'Ila a'da'ina' by convergence (Taqarub), no witness in this narration. Narrated: 'Wa in qasurat... fa-nudharibu' (Raf') by Ijwa' (rhyme flaw). 'Khuta': Plural of 'Khutwah' (distance between feet). 'Khatwah' (fatha): The action/source (Al-Farra'). Others: Synonymous. Parallel to Abu Qays bin al-Aslat:\n'And the sword, if a maker shortened it... My arm span lengthened it on the day of meeting!'\nThe witness: Coordinating 'Fa-nudhariba' on the place of 'Kana' because it is jussive in place (Condition response). As if: 'Nakun fa-nudhariba'. Like: 'Fa-assaddaqa wa akun...'.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in the Chapter: What Declines (Triptote) and What Does Not:\n'Da'd did not wrap herself with the surplus of her waist-wrapper... And Da'd was not given drink in rough leather bowls (Al-'Ulab)'\nThis verse is by Jarir bin al-Khatafi. Narrated: Ibn ar-Ruqayyat. Nicknamed Ar-Ruqayyat for saying: 'Ruqayya, no Ruqayya, O man!'. 'At-Talaffu'': Wrapping with garment. 'Al-'Ulab': Leather bowls for milking/drinking. Narrated: 'Fi al-'ulab'. 'Fi' fits here (milk *in* bowls). If narrated so, it has a grammatical place (State/Hal). If 'Bi-l-'ulab', no place (attached to apparent).",

Narrated: 'Wa lam tusqa'. 'Da'd' (first): Allowed triptote/diptote. Second: Only triptote to avoid breaking meter. Repetition of Da'd is for fame and enjoyment of the name.

Then indeed the wind is good, blowing from the east (Qabul)'\nThis verse is by Al-Akhtal. Name mentioned. Sadus: Tribe of Banu Shayban (open Sin). Tribe of Tayy (damma Sin - Kalbi). Dispute between Sibawayh and Mubarrad discussed in Book 1. 'Al-Qabul': East wind. Narrated: 'Shamul' (North wind). 'Shamal' patterns: 'Qadhal', 'Ma'l' position, 'Fals', 'Asad', 'Shumul'. Imru' al-Qays:\n'So Tudih then Al-Miqrat, its trace not effaced... By what south and north winds wove'\nAl-Ba'ith al-Mujashi'i:\n'Ruins of a dung-heap excited longing in you... At Nasifat al-Khuwayn or Janib al-Hajal'\n'Eternity came between the newness of its era... And every gusting north wind dragged [dust] on it'\n'Malik stayed in enemy lands... North winds blow on him'\n\nSpecific mention of 'Two Dirhams': Some thought it meant plural. Incorrect. It has a specific meaning. Al-Akhtal came to Al-Ghadban bin al-Qaba'thari ash-Shaybani in Kufa after the Bakr-Taghlib strife ended, asking for contribution (Hamalah). Al-Ghadban said: 'If you wish, I give you two thousand. If you wish, two dirhams?' Al-Akhtal: 'What about them?' Al-Ghadban: 'If two thousand, only few give. If two dirhams, every Kisra (Persian/Rich) in Kufa will give, and I write to our brothers for the same.' Al-Akhtal: 'Two dirhams is better!' He imposed two dirhams on every Bakri in Kufa. Then wrote to Suwayd bin Manjuf as-Sadusi in Basra (Leader of Sadus): 'Abu Malik came for Hamalah. I imposed two dirhams on Kufa Bakris. Do same for Sadus.' Al-Akhtal came to Basra, stayed with As-Salt bin Hurayth al-Hanafi, then went to Suwayd. Suwayd gathered Sadus: 'This is Abu Malik asking help. He is the one who said:\n'If I say I made peace with Bakr... Grudges refuse, not the distant lineage'\n'And spiller of blood with striking swords... Incidents perish but they do not perish'\n'They are two brothers warming at a fire... The cloak of death between them is new'\n'The milk-camel's colt lifts its tail if it sees me... And the huge lion of the highland fears me'\n'My hands did not wound Banu Sulaym... Nor my poetry, so Ash-Sharid would mock me'",

'Al-'Aba': Known cloaks. 'Al-Madrujah': Slit/Torn (singular Aba'ah/Abayah). 'Al-Qata'if': Woolen clothes. She says: Rawh and his tribe were not fit for silk, being Bedouins wearing torn cloaks and velvet. Rawh ennobled them without ancient lineage. Rawh was Abd al-Malik's wazir. Parallel: Mudrik al-Faq'asi:\n'Abs resembles Hashim if it clothed itself... In shirts of silk which their skins denied'\nNarrated: 'Kurdish cloaks'.

But you are the Hind of the severe ones (calamity)'\nBashir: Transferred (Announcer). An-Nu'man: Name of blood. Or related to Nu'man bin al-Mundhir (Anemones). Rawh: Transferred from 'Rawh' (Rest/Mercy). Zinba': Heavy person. Story: Man asked Abu Ubayda about 'Zanba'ah'. He said 'Heaviness'. Man fled because Abu Ubayda called his companion Zinba'.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'Of them are days of truth (strength) you were known by...

Before it:\n'As for Quraysh and its highest, they were afflicted... In Syria when the hearing and sight separated from you'\n'How many a coward I approached war with... On the day of meeting, and were it not for you, he wouldn't have been patient'\n'Sidq' here means Strength/Hardship.

'Hashw ad-Dir'': Filling of the armor (wearer). 'Lujja': Persisted/Plunged. 'Adh-Dhu'r': Terror. 'Anta': Predicate of hidden subject 'Huwa'. Ugly to be Subject with 'Ni'ma...' as predicate due to Lam entering 'Ni'ma' (Lam enters Subject). But predicate being a sentence eases it ('Zaydun la-huwa qa'imun'). If single ('Zaydun la-qa'imun'), difficult. Az-Zajjaj allowed 'Inna hadhani la-sahirani' as 'Hadhani' subject, 'La-[huma]-sahirani' predicate.\n'Idha': Adverb, operator is the meaning of praise in 'Ni'ma'.\n\nAbu al-Qasim recited in this Chapter:\n'We divided our two plans between us... So I carried \"Barrah\" (piety/loyalty), and you bore \"Fajar\" (treachery)'\nThis verse is by An-Nabigha, addressing Zar'ah bin Amr al-Fazari. 'Fajar': Treachery. Named like 'Hizam' (female name). Proofs: 1. 'Fa'ali' indicates feminine gender ('Du'iyat Nazali'). Zayd al-Khayl:\n'Salama knew that my sword... Is hateful whenever \"Nazali\" is called'\nAnother:\n'Death (Halaqi) caught up to them at their rear...'\n2. Nabigha named loyalty 'Barrah' (feminine) and treachery 'Fajarah'. 'Ihtamalta': Increased form (Ifta'ala) for 'Fajar' (treachery). Arabs use 'Fa'ala' for few/many, 'Ifta'ala' for many specifically. He mocked Zar'ah for excessive treachery. If he said 'Hamalta Fajar', could be once. Quran: 'Laha ma kasabat (good - easy) wa 'alayha ma iktasabat (evil - hard/accumulated)'. Good is rewarded for little/much. Evil only for great sins (accumulated). This applies to verbs used with/without Ta. Verbs only with Ta ('Istawaytu', 'Iktaraytu') don't imply 'many' specifically.",

    "text": "Meaning: Comparing Umar bin Hubayra (Al-Qaysi) and Khalid al-Qasri. Khalid replaced Umar. Umar wasn't beaten by bad policy, but Khalid's vileness floated to the top like scum/corpse, while pearls (noble Umar) sank. 'Ghurlah' (Foreskin): Khalid's mother was Christian, he was accused of weak faith. Built church for mother, destroyed minarets. 'Ala qabbaha ar-Rahman...'. 'Litani fi al-mu'adhdhinin...'. Floating foreskin test for gender (legend). Abu Ali al-Farisi: Verse seen in Sibawayh's handwriting. Al-Mazini: Said about a race between a Qaysi and an Anazi named Khalid. Narration 'Su' Sayrihi' (running) supports race theory. Another narration: 'Ghuliba... gurlatu Qanbari'.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the verses of Al-Jumal. Praise to Allah... Printed for the first time after 9 centuries... Author Abu Muhammad Abdullah ibn as-Sid.",
