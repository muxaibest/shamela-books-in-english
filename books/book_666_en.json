    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Al-Hasan bin Khidr informed us from his father who said: Sufyan said: Ja'far bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Al-Husayn bin Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah's blessings be upon them, entered upon me and said: O Sufyan, did you know that I contemplated upon doing good deeds (Al-Ma'ruf) and I saw that it is not complete except with three things?\nI said: What are they, may my father and mother be your ransom?\nHe said: Hurrying it, hiding it, and belittling it. For if you hurry it, you make it enjoyable; if you hide it, you complete it; and if you belittle it, you magnify it. But if you delay it, procrastinate it, and make it turbid, you diminish it and spoil it.\nThen he recited a poem representing this:\n(Munsarih Meter)\nHe nurtures his good deed and preserves it ... And indeed, beneficence is in nurturing.\nI said: This, by Allah, is cold spoil (easy gain) without the burden of travel or the hardship of journeying.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us regarding the meaning of Sufyan's saying:\n(Munsarih Meter)\nThe humble resident who has not tied a saddle nor a saddle-cloth to a reddish-white camel.\nOthers say: Al-Shawkal: The right wing and left wing of the army. Al-Shakil: The whiteness between the ear and the temple. In the Hadith: \"Inspect in purification (Wudu/Ghusl) the Shakil, the Maghfalah, and the Manshalah, for many people neglect them.\" [Al-Manshalah] is what is under the ring on the finger.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad told us from Al-Mazini from Al-Asma'i who said: When Khalid bin Abdullah Al-Qasri forbade singing, Hunayn bin Balu' entered upon him one day carrying his oud under his clothes. When the assembly dispersed and no one remained whom he would be shy of, he said to him: May Allah reform the Emir, I am an old man and I have a craft by which I used to provide for my family, and I have been forbidden from it.\nHe said: And what is your craft?\nHe uncovered his oud, played it, and recited:\n(Khafif Meter)\nO gloating one who reproaches for gray hair ... Reduce boasting about youth.\nWe have worn youth fresh and new ... So I found youth to be gray hair borrowed.\nKhalid wept until his sobbing became loud, then he said to him: I have permitted you as long as you do not come behaving badly or foolishly.\nSo Hunayn, after that, whenever he was invited, would stand at the door of the house and say: Is there a fool among you? Is there a quarrelsome drunkard among you? If they said: No, he would enter.\n\nAbu Abdullah Al-Yazidi recited to us:\n(Sari' Meter)\nDo not be engrossed in every error ... And do not be stubborn and contentious.\nFollow the people of virtue in their virtue ... And do not spare effort nor leave it.\nFor some of a youth's morals are his malice ... And some are like poured gold.\nSo do unto people the like of which ... You love for people to do unto you.\nHe who is content with a sufficiency of sustenance ... Day by day, lives the life of a king.\nHe took the meaning of the last verse from the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Whoever wakes up secure in his flock (Sirb), healthy in his body, possessing his daily sustenance, it is as if the world has been gathered for him in its entirety.\"\nAl-Sarb (with Fat-ha): The road/path. Al-Sarb is also: Camels. Al-Sirb (with Kasra): A group of women, gazelles, and cows. So if it is said: So-and-so is safe in his 'Sarb' (with Fat-ha), it means he is safe in his wealth and his path. And if it is said: He is safe in his 'Sirb' (with Kasra), it means he is safe regarding himself, his women, and his harem.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abd al-Rahman told us from Al-Asma'i who said: I heard a Bedouin say: Envy is an eraser of good deeds. Arrogance brings the wrath of Allah and the wrath of the righteous. Vanity prevents increase in knowledge and calls to stumbling in ignorance. Miserliness is the worst of diseases and brings the worst reputation. Mockery is the humor and craft of the ignorant. Disobedience (to parents) calls to scarcity and bequeaths humiliation.\n\nAl-Yazidi informed us from his uncle Abu al-Sheikh, raising it to Abu Muhammad Yahya bin al-Mubarak al-Yazidi who said: A man used to come to me asking about problematic verses from the Book of Allah, and I used to perceive obstinacy in his questioning. Whenever I answered him, I would see his color turn ashen and black. One day he said to me: Is it permissible in the speech of the Arabs to say: \"I made the people enter the house, then I brought them out as a man (Rajulan - singular)\"?\nI said: That is not permissible unless you say: I brought them out man by man, saying it to detail the genus.\nHe said: Then how did Allah Almighty say: (Then He brings you out as a child (Tiflan))?\nI said: This is not like that, because 'Tifl' is originally a verbal noun (Masdar), so it applies to the singular, dual, and plural with one word. So you say: \"This is a child (Tifl), these two are children (Tifl), and these are children (Tifl).\" Just as the Almighty said: (And the children (Al-Tifl) who have not yet attained knowledge of women's private parts). So 'Tifl' in the verse is in the place of 'Atfal' (children), as if He said: Then He brings you out as children.\nHe said: Then inform me about His saying: (That Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were leveled with them). From where will they get this earth there?\nI said to him: You are mistaken. Have you not heard the Almighty's saying: (The Day the earth will be replaced by another earth)? So they wished that *that* earth would be leveled.\nSo he fell silent.",

    "text": "Al-Akhfash informed us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi who said: A path is called, if it is clear: Mahya', Wadih, Bayyin, Hannan, Jaddah, and Nahham, if it is clear, wide, or narrow. Al-Wajab is the foolish man. Al-Wajab is the plural of Wajbah, which is the single meal in a day and night. Al-Wajab: The stake in shooting (archery). It is said: Wajabtu Fulanan: If I took a stake in shooting. Al-Wajib: The fallen one. Al-Wajib: The palpitation of the heart from fear. Al-Huns (with Damma on Ha and Sukoon on Sad) is the verbal noun of Al-Hasan (chastity) in women. He recited for a Bedouin girl who went out and a man accosted her:\n(Sari' Meter)\nO mother, a rider saw me ... Traveling on a clear, wide path.\nI kept throwing dust in his face ... Throwing (Hathyan), and protecting the domain of the absent one.\nHer mother answered her:\n(Sari' Meter)\nChastity, when they said you waited for him (Ta'ayyaytihi) ... From your throwing the dust at the rider.\nIt is said: Hatha Fulan at-turaba yahthu hathwan, and hatha yahthi hathyan (with Madd): You intended and aimed. Ta'ayyayti (with Qasr and Shadda): If you stopped and held back. It is recited:\n(Majzu' al-Kamil Meter)\nStand at the dwellings the standing of a visitor ... And wait (Ta'ayya), indeed you are not humiliated.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us from Abu Shabbah. He said: Yahya bin Sulayman bin Mu'adh wrote a letter to Abdullah bin Tahir, the beginning of which was: May Allah make me your ransom and grant enjoyment through you. So Abdullah bin Tahir wrote back to him:\n(Munsarih Meter)\nDid you attain a kingdom so you became arrogant in your letters ... Or have you deviated from what I knew of your manners?\nOr do you see in treating brothers equally ... A deficiency upon you in your lineage?\nIndeed, the beginning of a letter of a trustworthy person ... Is in its start \"And grant enjoyment through you.\"\nYou tired your hands in writing to me ... Suffice it for you what increases your fatigue.\nYahya answered him:\n(Munsarih Meter)\nYou commit sins in your letters ... Against a brother who shudders from your anger.\nHow could you imagine this of me when ... I did not commit a sin? And that is from your wonder.\nAnd is it permissible to supplicate in letters ... Between friends other than \"Grant enjoyment through you\"?\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us by Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir:\n(Tawil Meter)\nYou see every ignorant person, if he slips a slip ... Rush (Yatatyau) into its likes and aspire to it.\nSo be, if a person of knowledge has a lapse ... Guarding against it, striving, and asking for its forgiveness.\nHis saying \"Yatatyau\" means he rushes into it and falls without caution. From it is the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"You rush (Tata-ya'una) into lying just as moths rush into the fire.\"\nHe also recited to us by him:\n(Tawil Meter)\nFor every father of a daughter whose righteousness is hoped ... There are three in-laws, if the in-law is praised.\nA husband who fulfills her needs, a curtain that protects her ... And a grave that covers her, and the best of them is the grave.\n\nAbu Ja'far Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Rustam al-Tabari informed us. He said: Al-Mazini told us: Muhammad bin Sulayman al-Hashimi, who was the Emir of Basra, read on the pulpit \"Anna Allaha wa mala'ikatuhu yusalluna 'ala an-nabi\" (Indeed Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet) with Raf' (Nominative case for angels). He knew he had made a grammatical error, so he sent for the grammarians and said to them: Find a justification for it. They said: We coordinate it with the place of 'Inna' because it enters upon the subject and predicate. So he rewarded them and gave them good gifts, and he did not retract it so it wouldn't be said he made an error.\n\nAl-Zajjaj informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad informed us from Al-Mazini, he said: Al-Akhfash told me, he said: The Emir of Basra read on the pulpit \"Anna Allaha wa mala'ikatuhu yusalluna 'ala an-nabi\" with Raf'. So I went to him advising and alerting him, but he threatened me and menaced me, saying: You attribute errors to your Emirs. Then he was dismissed and Muhammad bin Sulayman al-Hashimi took over, so it was as if he learned it from the dismissed one. I said: This is a Hashimite and advising him is obligatory, but I was cowardly and feared he would meet me with the like of what the first one met me with. Then I forced myself and went to him, and he was in a room with his brother and the servants were at his head. I said to him: May Allah reform the Emir, I came for advice. He said: Speak. I said: This one, and I pointed to his brother. So his brother stood up and the servants dispersed. I said: May Allah reform the Emir, you are the people of the house of Prophethood and the mine of the Message and eloquence, yet you read \"Anna Allaha wa mala'ikatuhu\" with Raf', and it is a grammatical error that has no justification. He said: May Allah reward you with good, for you have alerted and advised, so leave with thanks. When I reached half the stairs, a speaker said to me: Stop where you are. So I stopped and my soul worried me, and I feared his brother had incited him against me. Suddenly, there was a swift mule, a servant, a chest of clothes, and a purse of money, and a speaker saying: This is for you, and the Emir has ordered it. So I left rejoicing.\n\nExplanation of the Issue",

    "text": "Know that if you say: \"Inna Zaydan qa'imun wa 'Amrun\" (Indeed Zayd is standing and Amr), you have two options for the coordinated noun (Amr). Nasb (Accusative), coordinating with the noun of 'Inna', as you say: \"Inna Zaydan qa'imun wa 'Amran\". It can be Raf' (Nominative) from three aspects: First, coordinating with the hidden pronoun in the predicate. Second, you coordinate it with the place of 'Inna' (which is originally subject/predicate), and coordination based on meaning is permissible after the completion of the sentence. Third, you raise it by Inchoation (Mubtada) and imply for it a predicate like the preceding one. This is agreed upon with no disagreement. Based on this, it was recited: \"Anna Allaha bari'un min al-mushrikina wa rasuluhu\" with Raf' and Nasb (for Rasuluhu). An example of Nasb is the poet's saying:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nIndeed the Rabie' (season) is generosity, and the Kharif (autumn) ... Are the hands of Abu al-Abbas, and the Suyuf (summers).\nHe coordinated 'Al-Suyuf' with 'Al-Rabie' after the predicate. But if you coordinate with the noun of 'Inna' before the predicate, it can only be Nasb, as you say: \"Inna Zaydan wa 'Amran qa'imani\". If you coordinated with the place of 'Inna' and said: \"Inna Zaydan wa 'Amrun qa'imani\", it would not be permissible because carrying on meaning is only after the sentence is complete. This is similar to his saying \"Inna Allaha wa mala'ikatuhu\" with Raf'. Some Kufans allowed it, and the reason is the predicate which was mentioned previously. However, it is permissible to delay the predicate and install the coordinated noun upon it, and raise it by intending delay, so you say: \"Inna Zaydan wa 'Amrun qa'im\", and the estimation is: \"Inna Zaydan qa'imun wa 'Amrun\", then you advanced it based on this interpretation. If you wish, you say: \"Inna Zaydan qa'imun\", and the estimation is: \"Inna Zaydan qa'imun\", then you advanced it. Based on that, it is recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nSo whoever spent the evening in Medina intending departure ... Then I, and Qayyar, are strangers to it.\nWith raising 'Qayyar' and installing it, and Qayyar is the name of his camel/horse.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Hatim informed us from Abu Ubayda who said: There was an Arab woman possessing wealth, beauty, and eloquence. She swore to herself that she would not marry anyone unless he defeated her in argument, so she cut off foolishness and people avoided her until a man volunteered for her. He came and stood at her door. She said to him: From whom are you?\nHe said: A human born small, and grew up big.\nShe said: So where is your land?\nHe said: On a vast carpet in a wide land, near yet far, and far yet near.\nShe said: What is your name?\nHe said: Whoever wants takes a name, and that is not a stoning (guessing) upon him.\nShe said: It seems you have no need?\nHe said: If I had no need, I would not stand at your door, connect with your means, and expose myself to your address.\nShe said: Is your need secret or public?\nHe said: Secret and public.\nShe said: It seems you are a suitor?\nHe said: That is it.\nShe said: Your dowry?\nHe said: Say it?\nShe said: I wondered.\nHe said: I wondered at the salt marsh; its soil does not dry nor does its pasture grow.\nShe said: I wondered?\nHe said: I wondered at the stones; their large ones do not age nor do their small ones grow.\nShe said: I wondered.\nHe said: I wondered at the seeker of knowledge; he does not reach its end nor fulfill his desire.\nHe said: I wondered at a pit between your legs; digging it does not bore one, nor is its bottom reached.\nShe said: You have fulfilled your need.\nHe said: I thanked.\n\nNiftawayh informed us, he said: Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-Hunayni informed us, he said: Ahmad bin al-Mufaddal told us from Asbat from Al-Suddi regarding the Almighty's saying \"A-tad'una Ba'lan\" (Do you call upon Ba'l), he said: A Lord. And thus it came in this report.\nThe Sheikh said: What is known among linguists is that 'Al-Ba'l' is the idol, so it was permissible because they used to worship it as they worship the Lord Almighty. 'Al-Ba'l': The husband. 'Al-Bi'al': Marriage. 'Al-Ba'l' is also: Palm trees that drink with their roots and dispense with watering. The poet meant this by saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nOf those coming to water in the low ground, drinking ... With their tails (roots) before the drinking of the throats.\n'Al-Ba'l' is also: The man who is a burden on his family. As for 'Al-Ba'al' with Fatha on Ba and Ayn, it is bewilderment. It is said: Ba'ila bi-amrihi yab'alu ba'alan: If he became bewildered.\n\nNiftawayh informed us, he said: Al-Hunayni told me, he said: Ahmad bin al-Mufaddal told me from Asbat from Al-Suddi regarding the Almighty's saying (Wa inna la-nahnu as-saffun), he said: Meaning prayer. Al-Sunni mentioned from Abdullah who said: There is not in the heaven a place of a hand-span except there is upon it the forehead of an angel or his feet, prostrating or bowing or standing. Abdullah recited \"Wa inna la-nahnu as-saffun\" (And indeed, we are the ones standing in rows) (Wa inna la-nahnu al-musabbihun) (And indeed, we are the ones glorifying).\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Hatim informed us from Abu Ubayda who said: Muawiyah wrote to Ubadah bin al-Samit: The Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, have gathered upon me, so write to me with your allegiance and marry Yazid to your daughter. Ubadah wrote to him: If the nation of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, gathered upon an Abyssinian slave, I would hear and obey. I have written to you with my allegiance. As for marrying Yazid to my daughter, I have written to you two verses, so hear them, and they are:\n(Tawil Meter)\nIf my soul obeyed me, I would have become ... Having grandchildren from what is considered many.\nBut my soul is noble to me ... Disdaining of the in-laws of the mean, capable.",

    "text": "Ibn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Uthman al-Ushnandani told us, he said: Umara bin Aqil bin Bilal bin Jarir informed us, he said: Asma bint Mutarrif bin Aban from Banu Abi Bakr bin Kilab was eloquent and sharp-tongued. She stayed as a guest with a man from Banu Nasr bin Muawiyah, then from Banu Kulfa, but he did not host her well. So she said about him:\n(Tawil Meter)\nA free woman traveled with me, twisting her arms ... Towards the light of a fire between Fardah and Al-Jazr.\nShe traveled what she traveled of her night, then she camped ... At a Kulfi man's who does not warm nor host.\nSo be a stone that does not taste a drop (of water) forever ... If you are a guest descending among Banu Nasr.\nShe also said about him:\n(Tawil Meter)\nWe traveled while remnants of sand were before us ... To his fire, glistening at midnight.\nSo Ibn Shamakh spent the night breaking open dates ... And did not give us to drink except watered-down milk (Samar Mudayyah).\nHe said: Al-Samar: Milk. Al-Mudayyah: Much mixed [with water]. From it is the saying of the other:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nUntil when the mixed darkness fell ... They came with 'Dih' (mixed milk), have you ever seen a wolf?\nHe says: They came with milk that was mixed with much water until its color became dusty like the color of a wolf.\nHer saying: \"So be a stone that does not taste (Tat'am) a drop forever\", for it is said 'Ta'imtu' regarding food, drink, and sleep. Allah Almighty said: \"And whoever does not taste it (Yat'amhu), then he is of me.\" And He said: (They will not taste therein coolness nor drink). The scholars said: Coolness (Bard): Much sleep. From the speech of the Arabs: The cold prevented me from coolness (sleep), i.e., the cold prevented me from sleeping.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi who said: The Arabs say \"Nazartu bi-'ayni\" (I looked with my eye), and \"Nazartu\" meaning I waited. \"Nazartu\": I had mercy. \"Nazartu\": I thought. \"Anzartu ar-rajula\": I delayed him. \"Anzartu ar-rajula\": I made him wait for me. He said: And \"At-Turab\" (dust) is plural, its singular is \"Turabah\", and the relative adjective to it is \"Turabi\". It is recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAnd they said \"Turabi\", so I said: You spoke the truth ... My father is from dust (Turab), Allah created him, Adam.\nHe meant \"Khalaqahu\" (created him) but silenced the Lam. In installing \"Adama\" (Adam - accusative), there are two aspects: One is that it is a substitute (Badal) for the Ha in \"Khalaqahu\" for clarification and explanation. The other is that he installed it by implying \"I mean\" (A'ni).\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us, he said: Tha'lab recited to us, he said: I read in the handwriting of Ishaq bin Ibrahim al-Mawsili by Ujayr al-Saluli:\n(Tawil Meter)\nO neighbor, I do not increase except in longing ... For you, and you do not increase except in distance.\nO neighbor, if a soul ransomed the soul of a dead person ... I would have ransomed you, happy with my family and my wealth.\nAnd I used to hope to possess you for an era ... But the decree of Allah came between [me and] my hope.\nLo, let whoever wishes die after you, for indeed ... My mourning was only for you from among the days.\nAbu Nuwas took the meaning of the last verse and said mourning Al-Amin:\n(Tawil Meter)\nDeath folded what was between me and Muhammad ... And there is no spreader for what death folds.\nIf houses are inhabited by those I do not love ... Then the graves have been inhabited by those I love.\nI used to fear death for him alone ... So there remained nothing for me to fear for.\nHe also said:\n(Majzu' al-Kamil Meter)\nYou were the pupil for an eye ... So upon you the onlooker weeps.\nWhoever wishes after you, let him die ... For upon you I used to fear.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us by Al-Nabigha:\n(Wafir Meter)\nFor I do not blame you for [not] arriving ... But what is behind you, O Isam?\nDid I not swear upon you to inform me ... Is the king (Himam) carried on the bier?\nFor if Abu Qabus perishes, there perishes ... The spring of the people and the Sacred Month.\nAnd we take after him the tail of a life ... Cut off at the back (Ajabb), having no hump.\nAs for Isam, he is the chamberlain of Al-Nu'man. He says: I do not blame you if you prevented me from reaching him, but inform me of his news. When a king fell ill, he was placed on a bed and carried on the necks of men, justifying it by saying it is more comfortable for him. As for his saying: \"Wa na'khudhu ba'dahu bi-dhanabi 'ayshin\" (And we take after him the tail of a life),",

    "text": "It is permissible to have Raf' (Nominative), Nasb (Accusative), and Jazm (Jussive). As for Jazm, it is by coordination with his saying: \"Yahlik rabi'u an-nas\" (The spring of people perishes [conditional result]). Raf' is by severance and inchoation. Nasb is by diversion (Sarf) with implied 'An'. Similarly, every coordinated verb after the answer to a conditional clause in the future tense allows these three aspects. Like His saying: (Whether you reveal what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills). In \"Yu'adhdhibu\" (punishes), the three aspects mentioned are permissible. In his saying \"Ajabba azh-zhahri\", he means cut off at the back. This is representation and simile. It is narrated \"Ajabbi azh-zhahri\" with genitive (Kasra) for both, as adding 'Ajabb' to 'Azh-Zhahr'. It is narrated \"Ajabba azh-zhahra\" with Fatha on 'Ajabb' and Nasb on 'Azh-Zhahr', assuming 'Ajabb' is in genitive position but diptote, and 'Azh-Zhahr' is installed by resemblance to the object, with the subject implied in 'Ajabb'. As if he said \"Ajabban\" with nunation then prevented it from nunation because it is diptote. It is in the estimation of your saying \"Marartu bi-rajulin hasani al-wajha, wa kathiri al-mala, wa tayyibi al-'aysha.\" It is narrated \"Ajabba azh-zhahru\" with Fatha on 'Ajabb' assuming it is in genitive position, raising 'Azh-Zhahr' by it, as if he said \"Ajabba zhahruhu\". The Kufans place Alif-Lam after the addition (Idafa), and the Basrans imply what connects the mention to the first, their estimation being: \"Ajabba azh-zhahri minhu\" (Cut off at the back from it).\n\nIbn al-Anbari informed us, he said: Idris bin Abd al-Karim Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ri told us, he said: Abu al-Ahwas Muhammad bin Hayyan al-Baghawi told us, he said: Al-Zamakhi bin Khalid told us from Ibn Jurayj regarding the saying of Allah Almighty (Do you build at every high place (Ri'in) a sign desiring amusement?). He said: Towers (Burujan).\nAl-Zajjaj and Ibn al-Khayyat informed us from Al-Hasan bin al-Tayyan from Ibn al-Sikkit. Muhammad bin Aqil and Bilal bin Jarir said: 'Ar-Ri'': The mountain. Other linguists said: 'Ar-Ri'': What rose from the ground.\nIbn al-Anbari said: My father informed me from Nasr bin Dawud from Abu Ubayd al-Qasim bin Sallam, he said: It is said: \"Akhdajat an-naqah\" (The she-camel miscarried): If she dropped her fetus incomplete in creation, even if at the full time of pregnancy, she is 'Mukhdij' and the fetus is 'Mukhday'. \"Khadajat an-naqah\": If she dropped her fetus before the full time of creation, even if complete in creation, she is 'Khadij' and the fetus is 'Khadij' and 'Makhduj'.\nAbu al-Anbari said: Tha'lab informed us from Salamah from Al-Farra', he said: It is said: \"Akhdajat\" and \"Khadajat\" with one meaning. Al-Kisa'i alone narrated \"Khadijat\" with Kasra on Dal. Abu al-Qasim said: The origin of \"Khadaj\" is deficiency, whether in creation or in time, but they differentiated between them due to the difference in context. From it is the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Every prayer in which there is no recitation is Khadaj.\" i.e., having deficiency. Al-Khadaj: Deficiency. From it is the saying of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, regarding Dhu al-Thudayyah \"That he is Mukhdaj al-yad\" (Deficient in the hand). Scholars say: \"Ath-Thady\" is masculine. It was only said \"Dhu al-Thudayyah\" with Ha because he went to the meaning of the piece of flesh and addition. Some say: \"Dhu al-Yadayyah\" with Ya, making it diminutive of \"Al-Yad\".\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us from Tha'lab from Umar bin Shabbah from Mukhariq Abu al-Muhanna, he said: I entered upon Abu al-Atahiya in his illness in which he died. When he saw me, he smiled at me and said: Come close to me, may my father and mother be your ransom. So I came close to him and said to him: What do you desire? He said: I desire to hear from you:\n(Khafif Meter)\nAhmad said to me, and did not know what was wrong with me ... Do you love Utbah truly this morning?\nSo I sighed then said yes, a love ... That ran in the veins, vein by vein.\nIf you discerned what my heart conceals ... You would see the heart ulcerated, bursting.\nWould that I died and rested from love ... For as long as I live, I am cast from it.\nHe said: So I sang it. He said: I see myself as if I have revived. He asked for it to be repeated several times, so I repeated it to him. He said: Leave rightly guided and come to me tomorrow, for if you don't see me, I have died. That remained his habit until the fourth day, I was busy from him, and he died on that day.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad informed us, he said: It was narrated from more than one source that Abu Nuwas, Abu al-Atahiya, Abu al-Shis, and Al-Husayn al-Khali' gathered in a session. Abu Nuwas said to them: O my brothers, this session has consequences and our meeting will be mentioned, so let each of us recite the best of what he has said. They said: Do so, and do not hold back from advancing Abu al-Atahiya due to his age. So he recited:\n(Sari' Meter)\nO my brothers, indeed passion is my killer ... So prepare the shrouds quickly.\nAnd do not blame for following passion ... For I am in a distracting occupation.\nMy heart spent the evening with a lean-waisted one ... With an anxious, roaming sash.\nAs if she, due to her beauty, is a pearl ... Which the sea brought out to the shore.\nHer love left nothing of me except ... A breath of life in a wasted body.\nPeople think I am healthy and do not ... Know of the hidden internal [ailment].",

What do you reply to the asker?\nIf you are in difficulty this year ... Woe is me, then promise me until the next.\nAbu al-Shis recited to them:\n(Kamil Meter)\nPassion stopped with me where you are, so I have ... No retreating from it nor advancing.\nI find blame in your love delicious ... Out of love for your mention, so let the blamer blame me.\nI resembled my enemies so I started loving them ... Since my luck from you was [like] my luck from them.\nAnd you humiliated me, so I humiliated myself striving ... What is one who is easy upon you compared to one who is honored?\nAl-Husayn al-Khali' recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAs if I am alone, not gladdened by a companion ... Of people until the Sacred Months pass.\nI am blamed for being occupied with one whom I am his occupation ... When he circumambulates or inclines to the Corner and touches it.\nWe will observe in the unseen what was between us ... And we will observe for our two covenants despite whoever dislikes.\nThen they said to Abu Nuwas: Come, recite to us. He said:\n(Basit Meter)\nDo not weep for Layla, nor yearn for Hind ... And drink upon the rose from a red [wine] like the rose.\nA cup, if it descends into the throat of its drinker ... You find its redness in the eye and the cheek.\nThe cup is a pearl and the wine a ruby ... From the hand of a maid, slender of figure.\nWe give you drink from her eye a wine, and from her hand ... A wine, so you have no escape from two intoxications.\nI have two intoxications, and the boon companion has one ... Something I was singled out with among them alone.\nWhen he finished it, they stood and prostrated to him. He said: Have you done it like the Khosroes? By Allah, I will not speak to you for three, nor three, nor three. When it was the next day, he wrote to them: My brothers, the days of life are too short to bear [separation], so make your rest today at my place.\n\nIbn Shaqiq al-Nahwi informed us, he said: Ahmad bin Ubayd informed us, he said: It is narrated that Abu al-Darda' was asked: Why do you not say poetry when others have said it? He said: I too have said. They said: What did you say? He said: I said:\n(Wafir Meter)\nMan wants to be given his desire ... And Allah refuses except what He willed.\nMan says: My benefit and my wealth ... And the fear of Allah is the best of what he gained.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us by Al-Atawi:\n(Basit Meter)\nDo not weep over a friend turning away from you ... Under the sky and above the earth are substitutes.\nPeople are more numerous than that you see no successor ... For one whom wealth turned his face away from your face.\nHow ugly is affection that brings closer and distances ... Between two friends, abundance and scarcity.\nHe recited to us by Ishaq bin Ibrahim al-Mawsili:\n(Tawil Meter)\nEnough sadness that no friend nor brother ... Attains richness except arrogance enters him.\nOr he twists away, or thinks you are below him ... And that is one that is grave, so there is no patience for it.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Hatim told us from Al-Asma'i, he said: 'Al-Muhjah': The pure soul/blood. From it, pure milk is called 'Uhmijan' and 'Mahij'. 'Ar-Radah': The woman heavy in her walk. 'As-Sirbah': The locust. 'At-Timsah': The lying man. 'As-Sahif': The broad arrowhead. 'Al-'Adiyy': The first to charge in war on foot. It is recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nHere is a pouch containing thirty broad arrows (Sayhafan) ... When the first of the chargers ('Adiyy) sense it, they shudder.\n\nIbn al-Anbari recited to us, he said: My father recited to me:\n(Basit Meter)\nMay Allah not distance a people, if you ask them ... They give quickly, and if you say help, they help.\nIf ample blessing befalls them ... They do not exult in it, and if it misses them, they are patient.\nBreakers of bones that have no mender ... And menders, so people are unable to mend what they broke.\n\nNiftawayh informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us from Umar bin Shabbah from one who informed him of his sheikhs, he said: Hassan bin Thabit ascended a hill one day and shouted: O men, O men! People gathered to him and said: What is your matter? He said: Listen. And he recited:\n(Khafif Meter)\nWorries prevented sleep in the evening ... And a phantom when the stars set.\nFrom a beloved, a sickness from him struck your heart ... So it is internal, concealed.\nO my people, does one like me kill a man ...

    "text": "If a year-old ant crawled upon her ... Her wounds would cause it to bleed.\nHer affair is musk and bedding, and above her ... Are silver and strung pearls.\nThe sun of the day did not surpass her in anything ... Except that youth does not last.\nMany a dream wasted by lack of wealth ... And ignorance covered by the folds of bliss.\nThey said to him: Is it for this you gathered us? He said: If this remained in my chest, it would have killed me.\n\nNiftawayh informed us, he said: Al-Hunayni told us, he said: Ahmad bin al-Mufaddal told us from Asbat from Al-Suddi regarding the saying of the Almighty: (This day I have perfected for you your religion...). He said: This was revealed on the Day of Arafah, and no lawful or prohibited thing was revealed after it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, returned and died.\nAsma bint Umays said: I had performed Hajj with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, on that Hajj. While we were traveling, Gabriel appeared to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, so he leaned on the she-camel. The she-camel could not bear the weight upon it, so I pulled a garment he had on over him. Then he mentioned carrion and what is with it, permitting it in necessity. He said: So whoever is forced by severe hunger - meaning in starvation - with no inclination to sin - meaning seeking a bite and not exceeding to a heap [eating only enough to survive].\nAbu al-Qasim said: It is said a man performed Hajj 'Hijjatan' with Kasra, and nothing else is permissible. The meaning is he intended by it performing a Sunnah. As for 'Hajjah' with Fatha, it is the single time of action like 'Rak'ah' and 'Darbah', and 'Al-Hijjah' does not mean that, but rather it means all the actions in their Sunnahs. The origin of Hajj is: Intention/Seeking. You say: 'Hajajtu fulanan hajjatan', meaning I sought him. If you meant a single time, you say 'Hajajtuhu hajjatan' as you say 'Qasadtuhu qadatan wahidatan'. It is said: 'Huwa Hijju al-Bayti' and 'Hajju al-Bayti', two eloquent dialects. 'Al-Hijj' also with Kasra refers to the pilgrims themselves. Ibn Duraid recited from Abu Hatim from Al-Asma'i:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nAs if their voices in the valley ... Are voices of pilgrims (Hijj) coming from Oman early.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us from Ibn Shabbah, he said: Al-Bahili told us from Ibn al-Kalbi, he said: Al-Hasan bin Uqbah al-Muradi told me, he said: Banu Asad bet Murad regarding a poet of theirs called Mahkan and a poet of Murad called Al-Nawwah, fifty camels against fifty camels, which of them is more poetic. Murad came to Al-Nawwah's resting place but did not find him, and found a small daughter of his. They asked her about him. She said: He is absent tending his flock. They said to her: We see he has grown old and his poetry weak. She said: Yes, by Allah, he has grown old, but he is surely the most poetic of those past and remaining. They said: We are your guests, so send for him. So she sent for him, and he was grazing at Al-Najaf. He came to them saying:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nO my camels, go in the evening to the guests ... If there is no overflowing evening drink in you.\nThen rejoice with the pot and the tripods ... And a ladler with a scooping ladle.\nThey said to him: We have bet on you and on Mahkan of Banu Asad fifty camels. He said: By Allah, I have weakened, and this daughter of mine is more poetic than me. She said: He lied, by Allah, we do not come close to him. Then she said to him: May Allah disgrace you for a poet, your people stone enemies with you and you retreat from them. So he responded to what they sought from him and recited:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nO you who ask about Al-Nawwah ... The brother of Murad, not one to move away.\nHere I am at the open dwelling ... Sharpening the two canines for butting.\nO wonder if my milking camels go ... And I do not fight openly any fighting.\nThrusting spears against spears ... On a day of commotion and spilled blood.\nThen he marched with them. When he and Mahkan al-Asadi met, Al-Nawwah recited saying:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nThis is my Jamil kneeling at Al-Abtah ... Upon him is a load, a camel not opened.\nMahkan said: No, by Allah, I will not be the first to open it. Give him his bet.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abd al-Rahman told me from his uncle: That the saying of Abu Nuwas:\n(Kamil Meter)\nSo Salma was, when she bid us farewell ... And the tear had risen to flow.\nA fawn, the singing girls advised regarding him ... Until they tied an earring in his ear.\nIs taken from the saying of Adi bin Zaid:\n(Ramal Meter)\nTo a slender gazelle possessing beauty ... Long-necked, raised among maidens.\nHe clothed the neck with a precise necklace ... And pearls adorned by the stringing of virgins.\nHe said: The maids of the Bedouins used to take the young gazelles, dress them with earrings and beads, and adorn them. This is the meaning he intended.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us from Ibn al-A'rabi who said: Al-Mir'ah (Mirror), Al-Sajanjal, Al-Zulfah, Al-Zalaqah, Al-Hamamah, Al-'Arnas, and Al-Badhidh are synonymous. It is said: 'Amarra ash-shay'u wa huwa mumirrun' if it became bitter, and this is the high dialect. It is also said: 'Marra yamurru mararatan, wa huwa murrun'. From the first dialect in the imperative, it is said 'Amrir ya yawmu', and from the second dialect 'Murra ya yawmu' with Fatha on Meem. He recited:\n(Tawil Meter)",

    "text": "If my day passes bitter in Kerman, for long ... Has decoration then the white milk been sweet between my sides.\n'Al-Murr' is the verbal noun of 'Marartu marran wa mururan'. 'Al-Murr' is the plural of 'Murrah'. 'Al-Murr': The rope. He recited:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nYour husband, O possessor of white front teeth ... And well-spaced teeth and free forehead.\nWas incapable, so we tied him as the tying of the rope (Al-Jarr) ... Then we tightened a rope (Mumarr) above him.\n'Al-Jarr': The basket. 'Al-Jarr' in other than this is the foot of the mountain.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us, he said: Tha'lab recited to us from what he saw in the handwriting of Al-Mawsili:\n(Kamil Meter)\nTime did not last in our separation ... And likewise Time separated between us.\nAnd likewise it does in its vicissitudes ... And Time is not reached by vengeance.\nI was stingy with whom I was bereft of ... So I became consoled when the matter became old.\nAnd indeed the best of your luck in calamity is that ... Patience meets you at its occurrence.\n\nAl-Zajjaj recited to us, he said: Al-Mubarrad recited to us by Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon him, mourning the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him:\n(Tawil Meter)\nLo, the announcer of death came early at night, so he terrified me ... And kept me awake when he rose calling.\nSo I said to him when I saw who came ... Is it other than the Messenger of Allah if you are an announcer?\nHe confirmed what I hoped from him and I did not imagine ... And my friend was my might and my beauty.\nBy Allah, I will not forget you, Ahmad, as long as ... The white camels walk with me in a land and cross a valley.\nAnd whenever I descend a valley from the earth ... I find a trace of him, new and worn.\n\nAl-Ma'nawi informed us, he said: Masih bin Hatim informed us from Abu al-Fadl al-Riyashi, he said: Abu Salamah al-Qamawi told me, he said: Ibn Udhaynah told me: Ibn Harmah stopped by my father while Nusayb was with him. He said to him: O Abu Amir, I have composed verses and I have come to you early with them, and I would like these two Sheikhs to hear them. He said: Bring them. So he recited:\n(Kamil Meter)\nMy companions and my mount knocked on Aliyyah ... Welcome to the phantom of Aliyyah, the frequent visitor.\nUntil he reached his saying:\nDid you not ask when the stars were barren ... And the mount of the seeker of means was effaced?\nAnd the shepherds became with their bowls suspended ... For foxes they roast and wolves.\nWas anyone who sought my creation blamed ... Or was my courtyard and side criticized?\nIf a night visitor seeks fire ... My dogs barked then guided him to it.\nAnd they howled so I hastened him, and they met him ... Striking him with the best parts of their tails.\nAnd they almost, from recognizing what they were accustomed to ... Of that, speak clearly with welcome.\nKuthayyir said to him: O Ibn Harmah, this poetry of yours indicates other than the house you attribute yourself to, meaning that the poetry of Quraysh is weak and this is the poetry of a strong stallion. Al-Ma'nawi said: Envy of the craft led him to attack his lineage when he did not find a fault in his poetry. He said: And among what is considered good of Ibn Harmah is his saying:\n(Mutaqarib Meter)\nFor I, and my leaving the generosity of the noble ... And my striking a stingy fire-stick with my palm.\nAm like one leaving her eggs in the open ... And clothing the eggs of another with a wing.\nAbu Abdullah al-Kirmani said: He means the ostrich because it is described as foolish, for it passes by the eggs of another and incubates them out of compassion for them, and leaves its eggs so they spoil and perish. Ibn Duraid said: The one described with foolishness is the hubara (bustard), and from it is the proverb:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nAnd everything may love its child ... Even the hubara and fly by it.\nHe said: Due to her foolishness, she teaches her chick to fly, so she deviates with it from straightness right and left, and thinks that is kindness to it, while it is oppression to it.\n\nNiftawayh informed us, he said: Al-Hunayni told us, he said: Ahmad bin al-Mufaddal told us from Asbat from Al-Suddi from Ibn Abbas regarding the saying of the Mighty and Majestic (Or He seizes them with gradual wasting (Takhawwuf)). He said: With diminution.\n\nIbn al-Anbari informed us, he said: Al-Khattali told us from Abu Ya'la from Al-Asma'i, he said: Sufyan told us from Tawus, he said: He who speaks and fears Allah is better than he who is silent and fears Allah.\nIbn al-Anbari informed us from Al-Khattali from Abu Ya'la from Al-Asma'i, he said: Al-Fudayl bin Iyad said: If it is said to you: Do you fear Allah? Be silent. For if you say: No, you have done a grave thing. And if you say: Yes, you have lied, for the fearful one does not do your deed.\n\nIbn Shaqir al-Nahwi informed us, he said: Ahmad bin Ubayd told us, he said: I was told from Hisham from Urwa from his father from Al-Nu'man bin Bashir, he said: Uthman or Muawiyah sent me to collect the charity (Zakat) of Banu Udhrah. I collected from them and departed. When I thought I had crossed their lands, a house appeared to me, so I headed towards it. In its courtyard was a young man lying on his back, nothing remaining of him but bone on skin. When he sensed me, he hummed with a weak voice and recited saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nI appointed the soothsayer of Yamama as judge ... And the soothsayer of Hajar, if they cure me.",

    "text": "They said: Yes, we cure from every disease ... And they stood with the visitors hastening.\nThey left no Ruqyah (incantation) they knew ... Nor solace, but they gave me to drink.\nThen they said: May Allah cure you, by Allah we have ... No power over what the ribs contained of you.\nThen he fainted. I looked and there were walnuts in the side of the tent. I said to her: O woman, bring out this young man to me, for I think he has died. She said: I think so too. By Allah, I have not heard a moan from him for a year except today, for he said at the beginning:\n(Basit Meter)\nWhoever among my mothers weeps for my sorrow ... Today, I see myself seized (dead).\nThey make me hear it, but I do not hear it ... When I ascend the necks of the people, displayed.\nThen she went out to him and he was dead. So she washed him, shrouded him, and buried him, and I prayed over him. Then I said to the old woman: Who is this? She said: This is the martyr of love, Urwa bin Hizam.\n\nAl-Zajjaj informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad informed us, he said: A man from Banu Makhzum said to Al-Ahwas bin Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari: Do you know the one who says:\n(Kamil Meter)\nPeople nicknamed him Abu Hakam ... By Allah, we nickname him Abu Jahl.\nHis leadership bequeathed to his family ... Meanness of branches and thinness of root.\nHe said: This poetry is by Hassan bin Thabit al-Ansari, and the verse recited by the Makhzumi is by Al-Akhtal. That is because Muawiyah was angry with a group of the Ansar, so he ordered Ka'b bin Ju'ayl al-Taghlibi to mock them. He said: Should I mock the Ansar? Would you want me to disbelieve after Islam? But I will guide you to a Christian boy from the tribe whose tongue is like the tongue of a bull, meaning Al-Akhtal. When Al-Akhtal said this verse, Al-Nu'man bin Bashir entered upon Muawiyah, took his turban off his head and said: O Muawiyah, do you see meanness? He said: I see nothing but generosity. So he recited saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nMuawiyah, if you do not give us justice, we will scoop ... The beards of Azd with turbans tied upon them.\nDoes the slave of Al-Araqin insult us out of belittlement ... So what is it that Al-Araqim avail him?\nI have no revenge less than cutting his tongue ... So take the one whom dirhams satisfy regarding him.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab told us from Ibn al-A'rabi, he said: It is said 'Ghasistu'. Abu Bakr bin Ayyash [said]: A man from Quraysh was accused of drinking wine. Abu Bakr bin Ayyash said to him: They claimed that a prophet permits wine. The Qurayshi said to him: Then do not believe in him until he cures the blind and the leper.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab told us from Ibn al-A'rabi, he said: It is said 'Ghasistu' (I choked) on food, drink, saliva, and speech. It is 'Al-Ghasas', 'Al-Ja'z', and 'Al-Harwah' with one meaning. Likewise 'Al-Tahtahah'. Al-Akhfash said: Al-Mubarrad used to narrate this very thing from the Basrans. He said: If differentiated, it is said 'Ghasistu' on food, 'Shariqtu' on drink, and 'Jaridtu' on saliva. From it is the popular proverb \"Hal al-jarid dun al-qarid\" (Choking prevented poetry).\nAl-Akhfash said: It is narrated from Al-Khalil that he said: There was a man who had a son who started saying poetry, so he forbade him from that. Evil boiled in his chest and he fell ill. He said to his father: If you prevent me from saying poetry, I will die. He did not permit him that until he became heavy and was despaired of. When he saw him like that, he said to him: My son, say whatever poetry you wish. He said: Far from it, choking has prevented poetry. And he recited saying:\n(Wafir Meter)\nDoes he command me, when my life has perished ... To verses he hopes from me? So I swear,\nIf I remained, I would have said a saying ... By which I would tail the rhymes of every Jinn.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab told us from Al-Zubayr bin Bakkar, he said: Layla al-Akhyaliyyah entered upon Abd al-Malik bin Marwan. He said to her: I adjure you, was there anything between you and Tawbah? She said: No, by the One who seized his soul and is capable of my soul, there was nothing between us. He arrived from some of his travels, so I came to him and greeted him. He squeezed my hand, so I thought he had submitted to some matter. So I recited saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAnd possessor of a need, we said to him: Do not reveal it ... And there is no way to it as long as I live.\nWe have a companion whom we should not betray ... And you are to another a companion and husband (Halil).\nAbu al-Qasim said: It is narrated \"Khalil\" with the dotted Kha, which is the friend. It is said: \"Khaalaka ar-rajulu mukhalalatan wa khilalan\" from affection. From it is the saying of Imru' al-Qays:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAnd I am not hated by friends (Khilal) nor...\nAl-Khalil also said: The man of poor condition. From it is the saying of Zuhair:\n(Basit Meter)\nAnd if a friend (Khalil) came to him on a day of asking, he says: ... My wealth is not absent nor forbidden.\nAnd \"Al-Khalil\": The husband.",

I said to her: O you, how were you content with your beauty to be under the ugliest of people in face? She said: O you, how badly you spoke! Perhaps he did good in what is between him and his Lord, so He made me his reward. Or I sinned in what is between me and my Lord, so He punished me with him. Should I not be content with what Allah is content with for me? He said: So she silenced me.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad informed us from Al-Mazini from Al-Jarmi, he said: 'Al-Mahl': Lying. It is said a man 'Mahal', i.e., a liar. 'Al-Mahl': Slander. It is said 'Amhala Fulan bi-Fulan Mahlan' if he slandered him to the Sultan. 'Al-Mahl': Drought. It is said 'Amhala al-balad' if it became drought-stricken. The noun is 'Al-Mahl' as it is said 'Akhsaba ikhsaban' and the noun is 'Al-Khisb' with Kasra only. 'Al-Mahl' and 'Al-Mihal': Deception and plotting. From it is the Almighty's saying (Shadidu al-mihal). It is narrated that Abd al-Muttalib, when he heard of the approach of the People of the Elephant to Mecca, vacated the Sanctuary and went out of it, and said: It has a God who defends it. He recited saying:\n(Majzu' al-Kamil Meter)\nO God, indeed a man ... Defends his saddle, so defend Your saddles.\nLet not their cross and their plot (Mihal) ever defeat ... Your plot (Mihal).\n\nAl-Yazidi informed us from his uncle Abu al-Qasim, he said: Di'bil was reproached for turning away from women, so he married a woman. She stayed with him for one night, then he divorced her. He was spoken to regarding that, and he recited saying:\n(Mutaqarib Meter)\nI saw an old woman approaching ... So she revealed to my eye a spitting place.\nShort of build, squat ... She rolls in walking like a bunduq (ball).\nShe draws her eyebrow with ink ... And ties a pad on her buttocks.\nAnd two breasts, a breast like an acorn ... And another like an empty waterskin.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Al-Atawi wrote to Al-Mu'tadid while he was staying at Sinjar:\n(Kamil Meter)\nO you who stayed in the villages of Sinjar ... And chose it as a home for the best residence.\nDid you leave Baghdad whose breeze has ... A fragrance from flowers and trees?\nIt is the paradise of the world, so how did you leave it ... And inhabit a house of no stability?\nAre there not in it a million heavily veiled ones ... In the pages of whose foreheads is the light of moons?\nAnd likewise in it a million virgins ... In whose face is a promenade for eyes.\nLook with your heart, not your eye, do you see ... Like its men in the rest of the cities?\nWho is it that you accompany there who has ... Bits of news and poetry?\nMixed with literary manners ... In the delicacy of flowing fresh water.\nAnd if you stay and sell us and our neighborhood ... For a near covenant or a new visit.\nThen I say with excess heat in the vitals ... And the blazing of a fire without sparks.\nYou did not deem my blood lawful while knowing that ... Whoever deems the blood of a person lawful is in the Fire.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi who said: 'Al-Hal': The meat of the two loins. 'Al-Hal': Black mud. 'Al-Hal': The bundle carried by the porter. 'Al-Hal': The banner tied for princes. It has three dialects: 'Al-Khal' which is the most rooted, 'Al-Hal', and 'Al-Jal'. 'Al-Hal': The meat of the inner thigh of the wild donkey. 'Al-Hal': The condition of a person; it is said 'Hal' and 'Halah' with one meaning. 'Al-Hal': Weight/Load; it is said 'Khaffif 'anni hali' i.e., my load. 'Al-Hal': The wife of a man. 'Al-Hal': The walker on which a child learns to walk. He recited:\n(Sari' Meter)\nAnd his luck continued to grow upwards ... Since he was born (Ludda) until the walker (Al-Hal) separated from him.\nHe says: His affair continued to rise and grow since he was weaned. Ibn al-A'rabi said: Some eloquent people recited to me the opposite of this:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nAnd since his membrane (Julbah) was cut from him, there continued ... To be for him from meanness a rein pulling him.\nHe said: 'Julbah' means 'Jalbah', which is the membrane the child is in, so it splits and he comes out of it, meaning since he was born. 'At-Tila'': The rope. He says: He still has a rope of meanness pulling him to it. 'At-Tila': Wine. 'At-Tila'': Tar. 'At-Tulla' with Damma, Shadda, and Madd: He said: I left him beating in his blood ('Tulla'ihi').\n\nAbu Muhammad bin al-Sari al-Sarraj informed us, he said: Waki' informed me, he said: Some of our companions told me that Abu Nuwas was seen by some of his friends in a dream after his death. He said to him: What did Allah do with you? He said: He forgave me. He said: By what? He said: By verses I said. He said: What are they? He said: They are in a piece of paper in a pillow that was under my head. The man went to his house, asked about the pillow, ripped it open, and found a paper in it written:\n(Kamil Meter)\nO Lord, if my sins have become great in number ... Then I have known that Your forgiveness is greater.",

    "text": "If only the doer of good hopes in You ... Then whom does the criminal invoke and hope in?\nI call upon You, Lord, as You commanded, humbly ... So if You turn away my hand, then who will have mercy?\nI have no means to You except hope ... And my good opinion, then that I am a Muslim.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us, he said: Tha'lab recited to us, Al-Riyashi recited to us, he said: Al-Mu'arrij recited to us for himself:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAnd I separated until I did not care about the distance ... And when neighbors, noble to me, departed.\nSo I made my soul fold upon the distance ... And my eye sleep upon the loss of the beloved.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Hatim al-Sijistani informed us, he said: Abu Ubayda Ma'mar al-Muthanna informed us, he said: When Hammam bin Amir al-Bakri died, his brothers said to his sons Rabi'ah and Kurayb: Which of you will take his weapon, his quiver, his horse, and his spear on condition that he fulfills Hammam's duty among his people? And which of you will take his camels on condition that he fulfills the duty of the guest? Rabi'ah said: I take my father's honor. So he took his quiver, weapon, horse, and spear on condition that he fulfills the duty of his people in what befalls them. Kurayb took the camels. It was said to Rabi'ah: Kurayb cheated you by taking the wealth. And it was said to Kurayb: Rabi'ah cheated you by taking his father's honor. So Kurayb recited saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nBy your life, I did not take the wealth except ... To give it, and that has a way.\nI invest it and know that in it are ... Rights whose abandonment is a long shame.\nAnd the best of wealth is what you gave from ... And the worst of wealth is what the miser kept.\nAnd I am never one to say to a thing ... Yes, without fulfilling what I say.\nSo whatever people hope for from a young man ... Then I am probable for what is hoped.\nAnd 'Ukabah has known after that I ... When a grave matter befalls it.\nThat my brother, when agitation is stirred ... Is the head of the spear and the polished sword.\nAnd short-haired like a staff, tall ... Strong of build, the remains (Thamil) are his right.\nSo the fearful one praises me when he calls me ... Through the dust and the humiliated man.\n\nRabi'ah said:\n(Wafir Meter)\nDid you not see me leaving the camels deliberately ... For my knowledge that they are a little good?\nAnd I said: Take the white ones and shepherd them ... And sufficient for me is the sword and the long spear.\nAnd a tall mare, the felt slips off her ... And obscure rings of mail having looseness.\nAnd a pot for the seekers, and its two bowls ... And a fire whose igniter is not blamed.\nMatters our father had acquired ... And there is no way to oppose my father.\nAnd they said: You have been cheated. So I said: No, rather ... You were cheated, so I do not rescind nor accept rescission.\nDo I take in exchange for height an old toothless she-camel ... Blamed, having a full udder?\nI spend the night eating her with an eye ... Sleepless, having a heavy look.\nAnd leave the glory of Hammam and my grandfather ... Jamil, and those by whom I attack?\nIf a man does not succeed his father ... A ghoul from the days will seize him.\nThe camels of your companion will be worn out by the nights ... And the beautiful mention will remain after them.\n\nAbu al-Qasim said: It is said a man is 'Mukhil' for good if he is worthy of it. 'Ukabah': Derived from 'Akub' which is dust. 'Al-Ajrad': Short-haired horse, a praiseworthy trait. 'Al-Hirawah': The stick/staff. 'Al-Mishmakherr': The tall one. 'Al-Thamil': Remainder of food and fodder in the belly. 'Al-Salhabah': The tall mare. 'Al-Qatir': Rings of mail, and in other contexts, gray hair. 'An-Nab': The aged she-camel. 'Al-Hafil': Full of milk; from it 'Ihtafala al-majlis' if it became full of people. 'Al-Ghul': What destroys man; Arabs claim it is the female of devils. It is recited for Imru' al-Qays:\n(Tawil Meter)\nDoes he kill me while the Mashrafi sword is my bedfellow ... And sharpened blue [arrowheads] like the fangs of ghouls?\n\nIbn al-Sarraj informed us, he said: Waki' informed me, he said: Al-Mutawakkil sent to Al-Hasan bin Wahb saying: Say poetry about the tomorrow of this day. He said: How can an imprisoned one say [poetry]? One who was with him said: Say, for perhaps that will be a cause for relief? So he said:\n(Mukhla' al-Basit Meter)\nThe morning has shone like the Resurrection ... And the sound of the Adhan has clashed.\nA night of amusement whose morning pleases ... A day of Tanajah (?) and a festival (Mahrajan).\nSo give me drink and sing to me ... Every captive and every sufferer.\nAllah saves every reunion ... That the accidents of time have scattered.\nDo you not see the Yemeni lightning ... Truly, certainly, it has saddened me.\nIt reminded me of the side-teeth of the daughters of ... That one who ruled the languid ones.",

    "text": "A beloved of mine, I was screened from her ... So I do not see her nor does she see me.\n\nNiftawayh informed us from Tha'lab from Abu Najdah from Al-Asma'i, he said: I heard a Bedouin woman describing her youth saying: By Allah, I was more beautiful than the sky and more desirable than water.\n\nNiftawayh recited to us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi:\n(Tawil Meter)\nDid you not see me resolving on cutting off and abandonment ... Of Layla, but I cannot bear cutting off nor abandonment?\nAnd no day has passed since I abandoned her ... Nor an hour, but I strive to mention her.\nSo oh wonder at my connecting the rope so she sees ... New [love], while its ties have become cut off.\nIf she becomes, after neighborliness and love ... Turning away, then deafness has become in my ear.\n\nIbn Shaqir informed us, he said: I attended Al-Mubarrad when a man asked him about the meaning of the poet's saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nIf my people, their spears had made me speak ... I would have spoken, but the spears made [me] drag (Ajarrat).\nHe said: This is like the saying of the other:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAnd a rhyme was said, but I could not ... Defend against it if you did not strike with arrowheads.\nSo I defend a right with a right, and falsehood ... Was not to defend against you the sayer of truth.\n\nAbu al-Qasim said: The meaning of this is that when a weaned camel colt persists in suckling, they put a sharp stick in its nose. If it comes to suckle its mother, that stick pricks her, so she prevents it from suckling. If it refrains from suckling her, [good], otherwise they make it drag (Ajjaruhu). 'Al-Ijrar' is to slit the tongue of the colt or cut its tip, so it is prevented from suckling by necessity. The sayer of the first verse said: My people did not fight, so I am prevented (Mujarr) from praising them because I am forbidden. As if their spears, when they fell short of fighting with them, prevented me from praising them just as the colt is prevented from suckling. So Abu al-Abbas interpreted it with the two preceding verses. 'Al-Ijrar' has another place, which is when a knight stabs another knight, embeds the spear in him, then leaves him defeated dragging the spear; that is a killer inevitably. From it is the poet's saying:\n(Wafir Meter)\nAnd another of them, I made him drag my spear ... And in the Bajali is a sharp broad arrowhead.\nAnd the saying of the other:\n(Kamil Meter)\nAnd we protect our honors with the best of our wealth ... And we drag spears in the war and leave [them in enemies].\n\nAl-Yazidi informed us from his uncle Abu al-Qasim from Abu Muhammad Yahya bin al-Mubarak al-Yazidi, he said: It is narrated from Al-Sha'bi that he said: Abdullah bin Mas'ud said regarding the saying of Allah Almighty (Indeed, Abraham was a leader (Ummah), devoutly obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth (Hanif)). He said: 'Al-Ummah': The man who teaches good. 'Al-Qanit': The obedient. 'Al-Hanif': The one who abandons Shirk. 'Ijtabahu' (He chose him) says: He selected him. 'Wa hadahu ila siratin mustaqim' (And guided him to a straight path) means he goes straight by it to Paradise. 'Wa ataynahu fi ad-dunya hasanah' (And We gave him good in this world). He said: Good mention and beautiful praise; there is no nation or people of religion but they ally with him and are pleased with him.\nAbu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Qunut' in language is prolonged standing. From it the supplicant is called 'Qanit', and the one praying 'Qanit'. 'Al-Hanaf': Inclination. The Muslim is called 'Hanif' for his turning away from Shirk to Islam and his inclination with no return. From it is 'Al-Hanaf' in the feet, which is the turning of each big toe towards the other and its inclination away from the other toes. The 'Hanif' in Jahiliyyah was one who performed Hajj to the House, washed from major impurity, washed his dead, and was circumcised. When Islam came, the 'Hanif' became the Muslim.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us from Tha'lab from Al-Mubarrad from Ibn al-A'rabi from Al-Mufaddal al-Dabbi, he said: The Commander of the Faithful Al-Mansur said to me: Describe to me the excellent horse (Jawad). I said: O Commander of the Faithful, if the horse is long in three, short in three, wide in three, clear in three, then that is the Jawad that cannot be outrun. He said: Explain them. I said: As for the three long ones, they are the ears, the neck (Hadi), and the thigh. As for the short ones, they are the back, the tailbone (Asib), and the shank. The wide ones: The nostril, the forehead, and the chest (Laban). The clear ones: The skin, the hoof, and the eye.\n\nAl-Ma'nawi recited to us, he said: Al-Fadl bin al-Hubab recited to us, he said: Abu Muhammad al-Tawzi recited to me from Abu Ubayda by Unayf bin Jabalah al-Dabbi, Knight of Al-Shit:\n(Kamil Meter)\nAnd I have milked the udders of time ... So I knew what to come to and what to avoid.\nAnd I have witnessed horses carrying my equipment ... Ready like the wolf of the thicket (Qasimah), plundering.\nAs for if you face him, he is like ... To the eye, a trunk from Awal, trimmed.\nAnd if you view him from the side, his regions are even ... And as if, when viewed from behind, he is pouring down.\nAbu Ghanim said: The meaning of these verses is taken from the meaning of Abu Uqaysar's saying in describing a horse: If you face him he is high, if you view him from behind he is low, and if you view him from the side he is even.",

    "text": "Abdullah bin Malik informed us, he said: Al-Riyashi informed us, he said: Muhammad bin Abi Raja' informed me from a man of Banu Makhzum from his father or his uncle, he said: I met Ibn Harmah returning from Medina. He said to me: This man has come out, meaning Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Hasan, and I have composed verses, so know them and memorize them:\n(Tawil Meter)\nI see people in a twisted matter, so do not cease ... To be cautious until you see the matter settled.\nFor you cannot return what has passed ... If the saying about its slips has left the mouth.\nHow many a person of ample honor you see silent ... And another destroyed himself if he spoke.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: My uncle informed me from Ibn al-Kalbi, he said: Abu Hatim informed me from Abu Ubayda, they said: Sama bin Lu'ay bin Ghalib went out from Mecca until he settled in Oman, so he recited:\n(Khafif Meter)\nConvey to Amir and Ka'b a message ... That my soul is longing for them both.\nIf my abode is in Oman, then I am ... Noble; I did not emigrate out of poverty.\nThen he went out traveling until he stopped at a man from Azd, who hosted him and he spent the night with him. When it was morning, he sat cleaning his teeth (using Siwak). The wife of the Azdi looked at him and liked him. When he threw a piece of his Siwak, she took it and sucked it. Her husband looked at her, so he milked his she-camel into a milking vessel and put poison in it, and presented it to Sama. The woman winked at him, so he spilled the milk and went out traveling. While he was in a place called Jawf al-Khamilah, his she-camel reached for an Arfajah bush and pulled it up, and in it was a viper. She opened it (her mouth/the bush) and threw it on Sama's leg. It bit him and he died. The Azdi woman said weeping for him when his news reached her:\n(Khafif Meter)\nO eye, weep for Sama bin Lu'ay ... The viper clung to Sama's leg.\nI do not see the like of Sama bin Lu'ay ... The she-camel carried his death to him.\nMany a cup you spilled, O Ibn Lu'ay ... Cautious of death, that was not to be spilled.\nAnd the intuition of night travel left a destroyed one ... After abandonment, boldness, and elegance.\nAnd you took a separation with a sharp sword ... And avoided the speech of the hinderers.\n\nAbu Abdullah Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Arafah informed us, he said: Al-Hunayni told us from Ahmad bin al-Mufaddal from Asbat from Al-Suddi, he said: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas regarding the Almighty's saying (Or did you think that the companions of the Cave and the Inscription (Al-Raqim)... the verse). He said: The youths, when they fled from their people fearing for their religion, were missed. Their news was told to the king, so he ordered a tablet of lead and wrote their names in it and threw it in his treasury, and said: There will be an affair for them. That tablet is Al-Raqim.\nAbu al-Qasim said: There are five opinions regarding Al-Raqim; One is what was narrated from Ibn Abbas that it is a tablet in which their names were written. The second is that Al-Raqim is the inkwell, narrated from Mujahid, and he said: It is in the language of the Romans. The third is that Al-Raqim is the village, narrated from Ka'b. The fourth is that Al-Raqim is the valley. The fifth is what was narrated from Al-Dahhak and Qatada, they said: Al-Raqim: The book. Linguists lean towards this and say: It is 'Fa'il' with the meaning of 'Maf'ul'. It is said: 'Raqamtu al-kitaba' so it is 'Raqim' and 'Marqum', as the Almighty said 'Kitabun Marqum' (A written book).\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Al-Sijistani informed us from Abu Ubayda from Al-Utbi from his father from his grandfather, he said: Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan appointed Rawh bin Zinba' over a task, then betrayal was reported about him, so he dismissed him and ordered him to come to him. He did so, and he ordered him to be beaten. When the whips took him, he said: I adjure you by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, that you demolish a corner of me that you built, or lower a raised status you elevated, or make an enemy rejoice at me whom you suppressed. By Allah, unless your clemency encompasses all my ignorance and your pardon covers the corruption of your favors. Muawiyah said:\n(Tawil Meter)\nIf Allah eases the knot, it becomes easy.\nLet him go.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us from Umar bin Shabbah, he said: Al-Hasan bin Ali married Khawlah bint Manzur bin Zabban. She stayed with him for a year not applying kohl or adorning herself until she bore him a son. He entered upon her one day and she had adorned herself. He said: What is this? She said: I feared that I would adorn and beautify myself and the women would say: She beautified herself for him but he saw nothing in her. But since this (child) has come, I do not care. When Al-Hasan died, she grieved for him intensely. Her father Manzur said:\n(Kamil Meter)\nI was informed that Khawlah yesterday grieved ... From the calamities of time befalling.\nDo not grieve, O Khawlah, and be patient ... For the noble are built on patience.",

    "text": "Abdullah bin Malik informed us, he said: Al-Zubayr informed us from his uncle, he said: A son of Abdullah bin Ali died, so he grieved for him intensely and refrained from food and drink for three days, and secluded himself from people. On the fourth day, his scribe went out to the chamberlain and said: He has prevented me from that (entering). He said to him: Give permission. So they entered upon him, and the scribe sat in their way and said: Console the Emir and entertain him. So they did, but nothing of their speech entertained him until Umar bin Hafs entered upon him and said: May Allah reform the Emir, the Book was revealed to you, so you are most knowledgeable of its interpretation, and from you is the Messenger of Allah, so you are most knowledgeable of his Sunnah. We do not teach you anything we see you ignorant of, but we remind you. These are verses said by someone who was afflicted like you were afflicted:\n(Tawil Meter)\nBy my life, if you follow your eyes with what has passed ... Of time, or what death drove to the grave.\nYou will surely exhaust the water of the tear ducts entirely ... Even if you were to draw them from the middle of the sea.\nSo I said to Abdullah when he yearned weeping ... Be consoled, while the water of the eye pours flowing.\nVerify, for if weeping returned a dead one ... To anyone, then exert your weeping for Amr.\nAnd do not weep for a dead one after a dead one, embryos ... Ali, Abbas, and the family of Abu Bakr.\nAnd I console you with a verse I said, which is:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAnd the easiest of what I encounter of grief is that I ... Will join him in his abode today or tomorrow.\nSo he called for food and ate, he and his companions.\n\nNiftawayh informed us from Ahmad bin Yahya from Ibn al-A'rabi, he said: 'As-Sabr' (Patience): Verbal noun of 'Sabartu'. 'As-Sabur': A dialect in 'As-Sabr' for this bitter thing (aloes). 'As-Sabr': Confinement. It is said: 'Sabartu fulanan kadha wa kadha' meaning I confined him for it. In the Hadith, a man held a man and another killed him, so it was said: \"Kill the killer and confine (Isbiru) the confiner (Sabir)\" meaning imprison him. 'As-Sabr': Daring/Endurance upon something. From it is the Almighty's saying (Fa-ma asbarahum 'ala an-nar) meaning how daring they are upon it. Al-Mubarrad said: Its interpretation is: What called them to have patience upon it? Ibn al-A'rabi recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nWe gave them to drink a cup like they gave us to drink ... But we were more patient (Asbara) upon death.\ni.e., we were more daring upon death, so we stormed the war and killed them.\n\nAl-Zajjaji informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad informed us from Al-Mazini from Al-Asma'i, he said: It is said: 'Arabbat an-naqah bi-l-fahl', and 'Alammat bihi', and 'Ashiqathu': If she did not leave him and became familiar with him. From this, the lover is called 'Ashiq'.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi, he said: 'Al-Ashaqah': A tree called Al-Lablabah (Ivy), it turns green then thins then yellows. From that is the derivation of 'Al-Ashiq'. He said: And it is said: 'Ghazala al-kalbu azh-zhabya': If he ran in its track, caught up with it and seized it, then let it go. From this is the flirting (Ghazal) with women, as if the man plays with her and makes her desire him, but if he tries to kiss her, she turns away from him. Al-Zajjaj said: The origin of 'Mughazalah' is from spinning and twisting because it is turning away from a matter. From it 'Al-Mighzal' (spindle) is named for its rotation and speed of turning. And 'Al-Ghazal' (gazelle) is named for its speed. The sun is named 'Al-Ghazalah' for its speed and rotation. He recited:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nShe said to him and leaned on her elbow: O youth ... Who drives the gazelles of the forenoon (sun/early hours) with the people.\n\nAbdullah bin Malik informed us, he said: Al-Zubayr informed us from his uncle, he said: Abdullah bin Muslim bin Jundab said: Isa bin Umar bin Talha bin Abdullah bin Ma'mar knocked on my door one night after I had slept. I went out to him and said: What brings you at this time? He said: Just now the slave girl of Ibn Humran sang to me your saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nCome, help me against the night, for it is ... Upon every eye that does not sleep, long.\nSo I said to him: May Allah fulfill the rights for you, O son of my brother. The response was slow until Allah brought relief.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abd al-Rahman informed me from his uncle, he said: Al-Hasan al-Basri passed by the door of Umar bin Hubayra and the Quran readers were there. He greeted them then said: What is the matter with you sitting, having trimmed your mustaches, shaved your heads, shortened your sleeves, and flattened (Faltahtum) your sandals? By Allah, if you had renounced what is with the kings, they would have desired what is with you. You have disgraced the Quran readers, may Allah disgrace you. Abd al-Rahman said: I said to my uncle: What is 'Al-Mufaltah' in [speech]? He said: It is the thing whose top is wide and bottom is thin. From it is said: 'Ra's Mufaltah', and the common people say 'Mufartah'.",

She was worthy of that in beauty and perfection. She used to spend the summer in Ta'if. During her stay in Ta'if, Umar used to wake up early, get on his horse, and ask the riders coming with fruit from Ta'if about the news to find comfort in what he heard of her news. One day he asked them about the strange news they had. They said: We have no news except that when we departed we heard loud screaming over a woman from Quraysh whose name is like the name of a star in the sky who has left us (died). Umar said to them: Al-Thurayya? They said: Yes. So Umar rode straight away, making his horse run full speed towards Ta'if, taking the Kada' route, which is the ruggedest and shortest of the two paths. When he reached Ta'if, he found her safe, coming out to watch for him, with her two sisters Radia and Umm Uthman. He told her the news. She said: By Allah, I ordered them to do that to know what (feeling) you have for me. Umar said regarding this journey of his:\n(Tawil Meter)\nThe red-black horse complained of the galloping when I exhausted it ... And showed that if it could, it would speak.\nSo I said to it: If I meet a delight for the eye ... Then it is easy for me that you tire and weary.\nI would then lose my wealth and my soul would depart ... If I did not say as a peer that Allah has saved.\nTherefore, I bring near a tethered horse instead of my [other] horses ... And I advise that it not be humiliated, but honored.\n\nAbu al-Qasim said: 'Ada al-faras' is said if he made it run (gallop). 'Kalla ar-rajul': If he becomes weak, 'Yakillu', 'Kallan' and 'Kalalah'. From it 'Al-Kalalah' in lineage is from weakness because it is what is other than the parent and child. Some scholars made 'Al-Kalalah' in the verse \"Yurathu Kalalatan\": The deceased. And some make it the wealth. Most are on what we started with. 'Al-Kall': The weak. 'Al-Kall': The heavy burden on his family. 'Al-Kall': The orphan.\n\nNiftawayh informed us from Tha'lab from Al-Riyashi, he said: Samura bin Jundub said: Muhammad bin Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf died. When we returned from his funeral, I passed by an old man from Banu Uqayl. He said to me: From where? I said: From the funeral of Muhammad bin Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf. The old man recited saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nSo taste as we tasted on the morning of Muhajjar ... Of rage in our livers and anguish (Tahawwub).\nHe said: Al-Hajjaj had killed a son of the old man.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad told us from Al-Mazini from Al-Asma'i from Abu Amr bin al-Ala', he said: It was said to a man from Bakr bin Wa'il who had lived two hundred and thirty years: How did you find the world? He said: I lived a hundred years in which I did not have a headache, then in the hundred and thirty, I was afflicted with what afflicts people.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us from Tha'lab:\n(Munsarih Meter)\nIndeed, Mu'adh bin Muslim is a man ... Who has groaned from the length of his life, eternity.\nThe head of time has turned gray and the age has become old ... And the clothes of his life are new.\nO vulture of Luqman, how long will you live and how long ... Will you drag the tail of life, O Lubad?\nThe house of Adam has become ruined ... And you are in it as if you were the peg.\nYou ask its crows when they hop ... How is the headache and the ophthalmia?\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Ahmad bin Yahya informed us from Abu al-Fadl al-Riyashi from Al-Asma'i, he said: I heard an old man from Banu al-Ujayf say: I wished for a house, and I remained four months thinking about the staircase, how it would be placed. And it was said to a man from Al-Dabab: Wish. He wished for a worn tent, a bow in a basket (Jullah) on a rainy night, and that a dog would come and enter the tent with him.\nAbu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Qaws': Remainder of dates in the basket. 'Al-As': Remainder of honey in its vessel, or the place from which it is gathered. 'Al-Ka'b': Remainder of ghee in the skin. 'Al-Hilal': Remainder of water in the trough. 'Al-Shafa' (shortened): Remainder of anything. It is said: Honey is 'Al-Asal', 'Al-Laws', 'Al-Ary', 'Ad-Dahk', 'As-Su'abib', 'At-Tarm', and 'At-Turaym'. It is said 'Tamanna ar-rajul': If he spoke to himself and thought. 'Tamanna': If he asked his Lord. 'Tamanna': If he lied. Some Arabs passed by Ibn Da'b while he was narrating to people and said: Is this something you narrated or fabricated (Tamannaytahu)? It is said: 'Tamanna ar-rajul': If he recited the Quran. From it is the Almighty's saying: (They do not know the Scripture except through hearsay/wishful thinking (Amani)). It is recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nHe recited (Tamanna) the Book of Allah at the beginning of his night ... And at its end, he met the decree of death.",

    "text": "Ibn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Hatim told us from Al-Asma'i, he said: Four did not make grammatical errors in seriousness or jest: Al-Sha'bi, Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf, and Ibn al-Qariyyah. Al-Hajjaj was the most eloquent of them. He said one day to his cook: Cook for us 'Mukhallalah', and increase the 'Fayjan' on it, and make for us 'Muza'za''. The cook did not understand what he said. So he asked some of his boon companions, and he said: Cook for us 'Sikbaj' (vinegar stew), and increase the rue (Sadhaba) on it, and make for us smooth 'Faludhaj' (sweet pudding). He said: And another time a grilled fish was presented to him, and he said: Take it, woe to you, and 'Sammimha' and return it. He did not understand him, so his boon companion said to him: He says to me, cool it down for it is hot.\nAl-Asma'i said: It is called 'Al-Faludh', 'As-Sartrat', 'Al-Muza'za'', 'Al-Luwwas', and 'Al-Lummas'. As for 'Al-Faludhaj' it is Persian, and 'Al-Faludhaq' is Arabized (Muwalladah).\n\nAbu Ghanim recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nO who is for a heart delighted by calamities ... The events of time threw at it from every side.\nIt became clear on the day of separation that his resolve ... To have patience was one of the lying thoughts.\n\nNiftawayh recited to us: He said Tha'lab recited to us from Ibn al-A'rabi:\n(Wafir Meter)\nIn the sides of Hijaz is a buried love ... That keeps me awake when eyes are calm.\nI yearn for Hijaz and its inhabitants ... The yearning of the tame one separated from the companion.\n\nAbu al-Fadl Zubayd recited to us, he said: Muhammad bin Dawud al-Isbahani recited to me for himself:\n(Tawil Meter)\nYour brother who became fond of your love ... Repents to you today from what preceded.\nIf you do not connect with him out of desire for his brotherhood ... And you are not longing, then connect with him out of generosity.\nFor, by the One who saved you from what he was afflicted with ... He regretted, if it pleases you that he regrets.\nBy Allah, the avoidance that passed was not ... Coquetry, nor was the harshness boredom.\nAnd do not reward him with abandonment if he turned away forced ... And showed avoidance and displayed frowning.\nAnd forgetfulness did not distract him from you, but rather ... He delayed when he did not find a way forward.\n\nHe also recited to me for him:\n(Tawil Meter)\nHe has an eye that shoots hearts with arrows ... More severe than the continuous striking with the sword.\nMy friend says: How is your patience after us ... I said: Is there patience so one asks about 'how'?\n\nAbu Bakr Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Mansur known as Ibn al-Khayyat al-Nahwi informed us, he said: Abu al-Hasan bin al-Tayyan informed us from Abu Yusuf Yaqub bin Ishaq al-Sikkit from Al-Asma'i and Abu Zayd and others. Regarding the names of head wounds (Shajjaj) mentioned in this section, the speech of some entered into others. They said: 'Shajj' (wound) is in the face and head specifically, excluding the rest of the body.\nThe first of Shajjaj is 'Al-Harisah', which splits the skin lightly and no blood flows from it yet. From it 'Harasa al-qassar ath-thawba': If he tore it lightly.\nThen 'Ad-Damiyah': Which its blood appears but does not flow.\nThen 'Ad-Dami'ah': Which its blood drips like the eye tears.\nThen 'Al-Badi'ah': Which exceeded the skin to the flesh and cut it.\nThen 'Al-Mutalahimah': Which took into the flesh.\nThen 'Al-Simhaq': Which exceeded the flesh into the thin skin that is between the flesh and the bone. That skin is called 'Simhaq', so the wound was named after it. 'Al-Simhaq' is also called 'Al-Milta'', extended and shortened. From it the Hadith \"Al-Milta' bi-damiha\", i.e., judgment is passed on it immediately and not waited to see its outcome.\nThen 'Al-Mudihah': Which pierced the Simhaq and exposed the bone, i.e., made it visible.\nThen 'Al-Muqarrishah' (Iqrashan with Qaf): Which cracked the bone but did not fracture it.\nThen 'Al-Hashimah': Which fractured the bone.\nThen 'Al-Munaqqilah': Which bones come out of it.\nThen 'Al-Ammah': Also called 'Al-Ma'mumah' and 'Al-Amim', which reached the 'Umm al-Ra's' (meninges), which is the gathering of the brain. Its owner faints at the sound of thunder and roaring of camels, and cannot go out in the sun.\nThen 'Ad-Damighah': Which crushes the bone (to the brain), and there is no survival for its owner.\n\nAl-Zajjaj and Al-Akhfash informed us, they said: Al-Mubarrad informed us, he said: It was narrated from more than one source that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, gave a sermon one day. He praised Allah and extolled Him - as He is worthy of - and sent blessings upon His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Then he turned to the people and said: O people, indeed you have landmarks, so end at your landmarks. And indeed you have an end, so end at your end. For the servant is between two fears: a term that has passed, he does not know what Allah will do in it, and a term that remains, he does not know what Allah will decree in it. So let the servant take from himself for himself, and from his world for his Hereafter, and from youth before old age, and from life before death. For by the One in Whose hand is Muhammad's soul, there is no appeasement after death, and there is no abode after the world except Paradise or Hell.",

    "text": "Al-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us, he said: Ibn al-A'rabi informed us, he said: It was narrated from Abu Abdullah al-Jadali, he said: I entered upon the Commander of the Faithful Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, and I saw poured gold before him. I said: What is this, O Commander of the Faithful? He said: This is the Ya'sub (leader) of the hypocrites. I said: And what is the meaning of the Ya'sub of the hypocrites, O Commander of the Faithful? He said: This is what the hypocrites seek refuge with, just as the believers seek refuge with me. So I am the Ya'sub of the believers, and this is the Ya'sub of the hypocrites.\nTha'lab said: Ibn al-A'rabi said: 'Al-Ya'sub' among people: The master (Sayyid). And 'Al-Ya'sub': The chief of the bees; if he flies, they fly with him, and if he lands, they land. It is said: They are 'An-Nahl', 'Ath-Thawl', 'Ad-Dabr', 'Al-Khashram', 'Al-Kharshram', 'Ar-Rasah', 'Ad-Dakha' (with light Kha and Qasr), and 'Al-Ya'asib' and 'An-Nub' are synonymous. It is recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nIf the bees sting him, he does not hope (Yarju) for their sting ... And he opposes them in a house of working bees (Nub).\n'Ar-Raja'' (Hope) here means: Fear. That is why the commentators said regarding the Almighty's saying: (What is the matter with you that you do not hope for Allah an honor [Waqar]) meaning you do not fear greatness for Him.\n\nAbu Muhammad Abdullah bin Malik al-Darir informed us, he said: Al-Zubayr informed us, he said: Sulayman bin Ayyash al-Sa'di from Sa'd al-Ashirah told me, he said: Jamal bint Awn bin Muslim told me from her father from her grandfather, he said: I went out one day and saw a man black like the night with a woman white like milk. I approached him and the scent of musk overwhelmed me. I said: Who are you? He said: I am the one who says:\n(Tawil Meter)\nOh would that I knew what the estrangement of separation ... And the distance at Umm Bakr's will bring us tomorrow.\nWhen the distance is coupled with us ... Then the enemies are alone with her after me.\nWill you cut me off when the enemies are present ... So they gloat at me, or will you remain faithful to the covenant?\nThe woman shouted at him: No, by Allah, but we will remain faithful to the covenant. I asked about him and was told: This is Nusayb, and this is Umm Bakr.\n\nAbu al-Qasim al-Sa'igh informed us, he said: Abdullah bin Muslim bin Qutayba told us, he said: Al-Sijistani informed me from Abu Ubayda, he said: When death approached Qays bin Asim al-Minqari, he gathered his sons and said: O my sons, memorize from me, for no one is more advising to you than me. When I die, make your elders leaders, and do not make your youngers leaders, for people will belittle your elders and you will all become insignificant to them. And you must preserve wealth, for in it is a sign of nobility for the generous, and independence from the mean. And beware of asking people, for it is the last earning of a man.\n\nIbn Mujahid informed us from Muhammad bin al-Jahm, he said: It reached me that a man from Khath'am said:\n(Kamil Meter)\nIf I were to ascend in noble deeds and high status ... Like the descent (Tahabbut), I would be the master of Khath'am.\nHe said: Then he became the master of his people after a while. He was spoken to about that, so he recited saying:\n(Kamil Meter)\nThe houses became empty so I became a master, not made a master ... And it is of suffering that I am alone in sovereignty.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: I was one day in the presence of Tha'lab, so I hastened to leave before the session ended. He said to me: Where to? I do not see you patient away from Al-Khuldi's session? I said: I have a need. He said: I see him preferring Al-Buhturi over Abu Tammam. So when you go to him, say to him: What is the meaning of Abu Tammam's saying:\n(Wafir Meter)\nO one familiar with weeping, how many a separation ... I shaded, so it was a caller for meeting.\nHe said: So when I went to Al-Mubarrad, I asked him about it. He said: The meaning of this is that lovers and those in passion may cut off and abandon each other out of coquetry, not out of resolve for severance. When departure time comes and they sense separation, they return to affection and meet out of fear of separation, and that the time of meeting might be long after it. So separation then becomes a cause for meeting, as the other said:\n(Khafif Meter)\nThey enjoyed the separation on the day of separation ... Seeking refuge in weeping and embracing.\nHow much they hid their passion fearing people ... And how much they concealed the burning of longing.\nSo separation misguided therein a separation ... That came to them by agreement.\nHow can I call upon the separator for injustice ... When on the morning of separation was the meeting.\nHe said: When I returned to Tha'lab in the other session, I asked him about it, and repeated the answer and the verses to him. He said: How intense is his obfuscation! He did nothing. The meaning of the verse is only: That a person may leave his beloved hoping to gain in his travel, so he returns to his beloved independent of moving about, so his meeting with him prolongs. Do you not see him saying in the second verse:\n(Wafir Meter)\nAnd the joy of returns is only ... For one stopped upon the grief of farewell.\nThis is parallel to the saying of the other, rather Abu Tammam took from him:\n(Tawil Meter)\nI will seek distance of the abode from you so you come near ... And my eyes pour tears so they freeze (dry up/stop).\nThis is exactly that.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab told us from Ibn al-A'rabi, he said: I entered upon Sa'id bin Salm and Al-Asma'i was with him reciting a poem by Al-Ajjaj until he reached his saying:\n(Rajaz Meter)",

    "text": "If I exchanged strength ('Ad) for strength ... It would not be equal, so I became bent.\nIndeed, he saw me leading the sitting ones (Al-Qu'ad).\nI said to him: What is the meaning of Al-Qu'ad? He said: Women. I said: This is a mistake. The plural of women (sitting) is 'Al-Qawa'id' as Allah Almighty said: (And the women sitting (Al-Qawa'id) among women). And in the plural of men (sitting) it is said: 'Al-Qu'ad' as it is said: 'Rakib' and 'Rukkab', 'Darib' and 'Durrab'. So he was silenced.\nHis way was to argue against me saying: Some plurals may be carried on others, so the plural of feminine is carried on masculine, and masculine on feminine when needed, as they said in masculine \"Halik\" in \"Hawalik\", and \"Faris\" and \"Fawaris\", so it was pluralized as the feminine is pluralized. And as Al-Qatami said regarding the feminine:\n(Basit Meter)\nTheir eyes incline towards the youths ... And I see them not turning away (Suddad) from me.\n\nAl-Yazidi informed us, he said: My uncle Al-Fadl bin Muhammad informed us from Abu Muhammad Ibn al-Mubarak al-Yazidi, he said: We were one night in Balad with Al-Mahdi in the month of Ramadan, four months before he became Caliph. They discussed grammar and Arabic language one night in his presence. I was connected to Khalid bin Yazid bin Mansour, and Al-Kisa'i was with the son of Al-Hasan the Chamberlain. The governor sent for me and Al-Kisa'i. I went to the house and found Al-Kisa'i at the door, having preceded me. He said to me: I seek refuge in Allah from your evil, O Abu Muhammad. I said to him: You will not be harmed from my direction unless I am harmed from yours.\nWhen we entered upon Al-Mahdi, he turned to me and said: How did they form the relative adjective for 'Al-Bahrayn' saying 'Bahrani', and for 'Al-Hisnayn' saying 'Hisni'? Why didn't they say 'Hisnani' as they said 'Bahrani'?\nI said: O Emir, if they said 'Bahri' in relation to 'Al-Bahrayn', it would be confused, not knowing if the relation fell on 'Al-Bahrayn' or 'Al-Bahr' (The Sea). So they added an Alif to distinguish between them, as they said in relation to 'Ar-Ruh' (Spirit) 'Ruhani'. 'Al-Hisnayn' did not have anything to be confused with, so they said 'Hisni' according to analogy.\nI heard Al-Kisa'i say to Umar bin Nuh: If the Emir asked me about it, I would have answered with a better reason than this.\nI said: May Allah reform the Emir, this one claims that if you asked him, he would answer better than me.\nHe said: Then I ask him.\nHe said: May Allah reform the Emir, they disliked saying 'Hisani' combining two Nuns, and there was only one Nun in 'Al-Bahrayn', so they said 'Bahrani' for that.\nI said: How do you form the relative adjective for a man from Banu Jinan if you stick to your analogy? You said: 'Jinni', combining it with the one related to Jinn. And if you said 'Jinani', you went back on your prohibition and combined three Nuns.\nThen we discussed speech until I said to him: How do you say: \"Inna min khayri al-qawmi wa afdalihim aw khayrahum battata Zayd\" (Indeed among the best of the people and their most excellent or their best definitely is Zayd)?\nHe lowered his head thinking and prolonged his thought. I said: May Allah reform the Emir, let him answer and err so he learns better than this speech.\nHe said: \"Inna min khayri al-qawmi wa afdalihim aw khayrahum battata Zaydan\" (with Zaydan accusative).\nI said: You erred, O Emir.\nHe said: And how do you raise it before bringing the noun of 'Inna', and installing it after raising, which no one allows?\nShaybah bin al-Walid said, partial to him: Perhaps he meant by 'Aw' (or) 'Bal' (but).\nI said: This, by my life, is a meaning.\nAl-Kisa'i picked it up and said: I intended nothing else.\nI said to him: You both erred, because it is not permissible [to say]: \"Indeed among the best of the people and their most excellent, nay their best, is Zayd (Zaydan - acc).\"\nAl-Mahdi said: O Kisa'i, nothing like today has passed you by. He said: So what is the correct way according to you?\nI said: \"Inna min khayri al-qawmi wa afdalihim aw khayrahum battata Zaydun\" (with Zaydun nominative), on the meaning of repeating 'Inna'.\nAl-Mahdi said: You have differed and you are both just witnesses, so who will judge between you?\nI said: The eloquent Arabs of natural disposition.\nSo he sent for Abu al-Mutawwaq. I composed verses until he came. Al-Mahdi was inclined towards his maternal uncles from Yemen. I said:\n(Munsarih Meter)\nO you who ask me to inform him ... About those in Sana'a of noble lineage.\nHimyar are its masters, you acknowledge them ... The best of all the multitudes of Arabs.\nSo indeed among their best and most excellent ... Or their best definitely is Abu Karib.\nWhen Abu al-Mutawwaq came, I recited the verses to him and asked him about the issue. He agreed with me:\n(Khafif Meter)\nLive with luck (Jadd) and stupidity will not harm you ... For the life of whom you see is only by luck.\nLive with luck and be Habannaqah al-Qaysi ... In ignorance, or Shaybah bin al-Walid.\nShayb, O Shayb, O Hani' of Banu al-Qa'qa', you are not the forbearing, the rational.\nNo, nor is there in you a trait of traits ... Of good that you attained by forbearance or generosity.\nExcept that you are proficient in beautifying ... Singing by striking a tambourine and oud.\nSo upon this and that you endure time ... Being glorified by it and not glorified.",

    "text": "Abu al-Qasim said: The issue is built on corruption for the sake of deception (trickery). As for Al-Kisa'i's answer, it is not satisfactory to anyone. Al-Yazidi's answer is not permissible according to us because he hid 'Inna' and made it operate, and it is not in its power to be hidden and operate. As for repeating it, it is permissible, it has come in the Quran. Allah Almighty said (Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who associated with others - indeed, Allah will judge between them). He made the second 'Inna' with its noun and predicate a predicate for the first. The poet said:\n(Basit Meter)\nIndeed the Caliph, indeed Allah clothed him ... With a cloak of kingship by which endings are hoped.\nThe correct view according to us in the issue is to say: \"Inna min khayri al-qawmi wa afdalihim aw khayruhum al-battata Zaydun\", so the noun of 'Inna' is hidden in it, and what follows is a new sentence. Sibawayh mentioned: 'Al-Battata' is a source the Arabs did not use except with Alif and Lam, and deleting them from it is a mistake.\n\nAl-Zajjaj informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad informed us, he said: Al-Mada'ini told us from Al-Ajlani from Isma'il bin Yasar, he said: A son of Arta'ah bin Suhayyah al-Murri died, so he stuck to his grave for a year, coming to it in the morning standing over it saying: O Amr, are you going with me or shall I stay with you until the evening? Then he comes to it in the evening and says the like. When it was after the year, he recited saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nUntil the year, then the name of peace be upon you both ... And whoever weeps for a full year has excused himself.\nThen he left his grave and recited saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nI stood at Layla's grave and my standing ... Upon it was nothing but weeping and anxious.\nAre you Layla's son if I waited for you going ... With the caravan or tomorrow, tomorrow then with me?\nIf my mind was present with me, I would not have been struck by ... Forgetfulness at a grave in the sides of Ajra'.\nI was nothing but distraught after losing her ... Over losing her, following the repeated yearning.\nIf you do not find it, turn to your intentions ... From the earth or come to a thousand so graze.\nUpon Time, so blame, for it is not blameworthy ... And in other than whom the earth has hidden, have hope.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad informed us from Al-Mazini from Al-Asma'i, he said: Khalaf, when he went to his bed, would not lie down until he recited:\n(Basit Meter)\nA man does not cease exploring his lying places ... Until he spends the night lying in the furthest of them.\nAnd he never stops purifying his drinking places ... Until he gulps from the muddy water of decay, gulps.\nSo prevent your eyelids all night their slumber ... And knock your vitals with the deliciousness of quenching and satiety.\nAnd feel righteousness and piety, prepare them ... Until you attain with them success and elevation.\n\nIbn al-Anbari informed us, he said: Al-Khattali informed me from Al-Asma'i, Al-Khalil said: I looked into the science of stars (astrology), and I stumbled from it upon what obligated me to leave it. And he recited saying:\n(Khafif Meter)\nConvey from me to the astrologer that I ... Am a disbeliever in what the stars decreed.\nKnowing that what will be and what was ... Is a decree from the Guardian (Al-Muhaymin), obligatory.\nAbu al-Qasim said: Al-Muhaymin: The Trustworthy (Al-Amin). Linguists say the Ha in it is a substitute for Hamza. It is recited for Al-Abbas bin Abd al-Muttalib praising the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him:\n(Munsarih Meter)\nBefore it, you were good in the shadows and in ... A repository where the leaves are sewn.\nThen you descended to the lands, not human ... You, nor a chew of flesh nor a clot.\nBut a drop riding the ships, and ... The drowning had bridled Nasr and his people.\nTransferring from a loin to a womb ... When a world passed, a layer appeared.\nUntil your house, the guarded (Al-Muhaymin), contained from ... Khindif a high place under which are the zones.\nAnd when you were born, the earth shone ... And the horizons were illuminated by your light.\nAnd we are in that illumination and in ... Paths of guidance and rationality, piercing through.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us from Tha'lab:\n(Kamil Meter)\nAnd upon Quddam I carried the equipment of a determined one ... In fear, his heart is not burdened.\nAs for if you face her, you imagine her ... Like the trunk trimmed by the marrow of the sickle.\nAs for if you view her from the side, she is flown ... Her hooves repel the crushed stones.\nAs for if you view her from behind, she is noble ... Elevated in the place of her girth and the spurring place.\nAnd if you describe, you describe the middle of a locust ... And if you possess her rein, you will not fail.\nAnd she was a Hiri waterskin, filled ... With which a croup, strong of joint, is raised.\nSo my sight chose her for my knowledge that she ...

    "text": "Ibn Duraid informed us, he said: Al-Sijistani told us from Al-Asma'i from Abu Amr bin al-Ala', he said: It was said to a man from Banu Bakr bin Wa'il who had grown old until the pleasure of food, drink, and marriage had gone from him: Do you love to die? He said: No. It was said: So what remains of your pleasures in the world? He said: Hearing wonders. And he recited saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAnd the destruction of a youth is that he does not rest towards generosity ... And that he does not see a wonderful thing and wonder.\nThe meaning of 'Yurah': 'Yartah' (finds rest/joy). The meaning of the speech: And that he does not wonder when he sees a wonder.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Hatim told us from Al-Asma'i, he said: Ru'ba said in describing horses and erred. He said in describing the legs:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nWith four that do not cling to the bending ... They fall in pairs and land in agreement.\nSalm said to him: This is wrong, this is harm. Do you make him gallop with his leg and swim with his hand (arm) as Abu al-Najm said:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nHe gallops his rear and follows his front.\nHe said: O my son, you are more knowledgeable about horses than me, but bring me close to the tail of this camel. Al-Asma'i said: So he was brought close to it but did nothing.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us from Tha'lab from Ibn Shabbah, he said: It was narrated from Hisham bin Urwa that Abd al-Rahman bin Abi Bakr Al-Siddiq entered Damascus in the Pre-Islamic era and saw a girl like an Arabian filly, surrounded by maids ransoming her and swearing by her head, saying: No, by the right of the daughter of Al-Judi. So she fell into his heart. He turned away from her and recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nHe remembered Layla while Al-Samawah was between them ... And what has the daughter of Al-Judi to do with Layla and my wealth?\nAnd how can a Harithiyyah concern his heart ... Who frequents Busra or inhabits Al-Jabiya?\nAnd how can he meet her? Nay, but perhaps she ... If people attend a season, she might come.\nHe said: He continued to mention her in poetry. When it was the Caliphate of Umar and he sent to the Levant, he said to them: If you storm Damascus, give the daughter of Al-Judi as spoil to Ibn Abi Bakr. So she was given to him. He preferred her over his wives until they complained about him to Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. She scolded him for that and said to him: Indeed your wives have a right upon you. He said: It is as if I am sipping a pomegranate seed with her saliva.\n\nMuhammad bin al-Qasim al-Anbari told us, he said: My father told us from Ahmad bin al-Harith from Al-Mada'ini, he said: Umar bin Abd al-Aziz used to say: If it is the Day of Resurrection and the Romans come with their Caesars and the Persians with their Khosroes, we will come with Al-Hajjaj and he will be equal to them.\n\nIbn Shaqir Ahmad bin al-Husayn informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us from Ibn al-A'rabi, he said: It is said 'Laqa'a Fulanun Fulanan bi-'aynihi', and 'Zalaqahu', 'Azlaqahu', 'Shaqadhahu', and 'Shawwahahu': All that if he hit him with the evil eye. A man says to his companion if he does well in an action: 'La tushawwih 'alayya': i.e., Do not say to me you did well lest you hit me with your eye. It is said: A man 'Ma'yun': If he has the evil eye (is affected). It is said: A man 'Sha'ih', 'Shah', 'Mushawwih', 'Shaqidh', and 'Shaqidhan': If he is severe in hitting with the evil eye.\nHe said: Muawiyah and Ibn al-Zubayr were traveling together and saw a rider from afar. Muawiyah said: It is so-and-so. Ibn al-Zubayr said: It is so-and-so. When we verified it, it was as Ibn al-Zubayr said. Muawiyah said: O Abu Bakr, how excellent is this sharpness with old age? He said: Your blessing (Birraka), O Commander of the Faithful. He said: Your blessing, O Commander of the Faithful. He said: Your blessing, O Commander of the Faithful. So he fell silent. He said the third one, so I fell silent and laughed. Ibn al-Zubayr said: How excellent are these incisors and how charming is this face with the length of life and abundance of worries. Then they separated. Ibn al-Zubayr complained of his eyes until they were almost gone, and Muawiyah's incisors fell out. They met in the second year, so he said to him: O Abu Bakr, I am 'Ashwa' than you: i.e., greater in luck than you in hitting with the evil eye. And I am less harmful than you. Tha'lab said: It is from their saying 'Ramahu' (He shot him): If he did not hit his killer spot.\n\nIbn al-Anbari informed us from his father from some of his sheikhs from Muhammad bin Hazim, who was a witty poet, he said: Bashar bin Burd invited us, and he had two singing girls. In the gathering, some of us were toying with them and extending hands to them. I disdained that for him, so I wrote to him the next day:\n(Khafif Meter)\nFear Allah, you are the poet of Qays ... Do not be a stain upon the poets.\nIndeed your brothers residing yesterday ... Came for adultery, not for singing.\nYou are blind, and adulterers have lapses ... Denounced, hidden from the sighted.\nGranted you master speech, but what is your knowledge in it ... Of winking and gesturing?\nAnd signals with eyes and hands ... And taking appointments for meeting?\nThey settled their affair while you are a donkey ... Loaded with stupidity and dim-wittedness.\nHe said: So he took them to the market and sold them.\n\nHe said: Abu Isa Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Qatan al-Simsar al-Ajli informed us, he said: Abu Ja'far bin Abi Shaybah informed us, he said: I saw Ibn Abi al-Atahiya standing in the graveyards saying:\n(Kamil Meter)",

    "text": "O people of the graves, I came to you inquiring ... And behold, your gathering is deaf and dumb.\nIndeed, a man who remembers the Return out of fear ... Is luckier than one who does not fear it, and wiser.\nO greedy man, do you not see ... The signs of your life being erased every day?\nWith you, may you have no father, since you were created, entrusted ... Is an angel counting against you what you breathe.\nSo when the term decreed for you ends ... And passes, you have no place of confinement after that.\nAbu Isa said: I heard our sheikhs saying: The son of Adam breathes in every day and night twenty-four thousand breaths, in every hour a thousand breaths. So the exit of his soul is with the last breath decreed for him.\n\nNiftawayh informed us, he said: Ishaq bin al-Husayn bin Maymun Abu Ya'qub al-Harbi told us, he said: Al-Husayn bin Muhammad told us from Shayban from Qatada regarding the Almighty's saying: (Or do We treat those who believe and do righteous deeds... the verse). He said: The people separated in their religions at death and at the destination. And Qatada said: (Or He seizes them with gradual wasting (Takhawwuf)). He said: With diminution.\nAbu al-Qasim said: Our companions say: Al-Akhfash Sa'id bin Mas'adah used to recite for this letter:\n(Basit Meter)\nThe journey diminished (Takhawwafa) from her a tall hump ... As the file (Safan) diminished the wood of the Nab' tree.\nLinguists and commentators are on this interpretation except what was narrated from Al-Dahhak, for he used to say: Its interpretation is that He destroys their people and frightens others with them.\n\nIbn Shaqir al-Nahwi and Al-Akhfash informed us, they said: Tha'lab informed us, he said: Al-Kisa'i and Al-Asma'i met in the presence of Al-Rashid, and they were accompanying him, staying when he stayed and traveling when he traveled. Al-Kisa'i recited:\n(Basit Meter)\nHow did they reward Amir with evil for their deed ... Or how do they reward me with evil for good?\nOr how does what the nursing camel ('Aluq) gives benefit ... Affection (Ri'man) of a nose when the milk is withheld?\nAl-Asma'i said: It is only 'Ri'mana' with Nasb (Accusative). Al-Kisa'i said to him: Be silent, what are you and this? It is permissible 'Ri'manu', 'Ri'mana', and 'Ri'mani' his nose, with Raf', Nasb, and Khafd. As for Raf', it is by returning to 'Ma' because it is in the place of Raf' by 'Yanfa'u', so the estimation becomes: Or how does affection of a nose benefit. Nasb is by 'Tu'ti'. Khafd is by returning to the Ha that is in 'Bi-hi'. He said: So Al-Asma'i fell silent, and he had no knowledge of Arabic (Grammar), but was a man of Language (Lexicography). The meaning of this verse: It is a proverb struck for one who promises you with his tongue every beautiful thing but does nothing of it because his heart contains the opposite. As if it was said to him: How does your beautiful speech benefit me if you do not fulfill it? Its origin is that the 'Aluq' is the she-camel that loses her calf by slaughter or death, so its skin is skinned and stuffed with straw or grass and presented to her so she accepts it (Tar'amuhu), i.e., inclines towards it and lets down her milk so she is benefited from. She sniffs it with her nose but her heart denies it, so she inclines towards it but does not release the milk. He likened this to that.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us from Al-Ukli from Abu Ubayda, he said: Alexander passed by a city that had been ruled by seven kings, all of whom perished along with their offspring. He asked: Did any of their offspring remain? They said: One man who shelters in the graveyards. He summoned him and said: What drove you to stick to the graves? He said: I wanted to separate the bones of kings from the bones of their slaves, but I found them equal. He said: Would you like to follow me so I can revive through you the honor of your days if you have ambition? He said: My ambition is indeed great if you have my desire. He said: And what is your desire? He said: A life with no death, a youth with no old age, and a joy with no dislike and no fear of poverty with it. He said: That is not up to me. He said: Then go about your business and let me seek it. Alexander said: This is the wisest person I have seen.\n\nIbn Rustam al-Tabari informed us, he said: I attended the session of Al-Mazini when it was said to him:",

    "text": "Why did you reduce your narration from Al-Asma'i? He said: I was accused in his view of Qadar (Free Will doctrine) and leaning towards the doctrines of the Mu'tazila. I came to him one day while he was in his session, and he said: What do you say about the saying of Allah Almighty (Inna kulla shay'in khalaqnahu bi-qadarin)? I said: Sibawayh holds that Raf' (Nominative) in it is stronger than Nasb (Accusative) in Arabic due to the verb being occupied with the pronoun, and there is nothing here that is more entitled to the verb. But the general reciters refused anything but Nasb, so we read it so following that because reading is a Sunnah. He said to me: So what is the difference between Raf' and Nasb in meaning? I knew his intent and feared he would incite the common people against me, so I said: Raf' is Inchoation (Mubtada) and Nasb is by implying a verb, and I feigned ignorance to him. He said: Our companions told me that Al-Farazdaq said one day to his companions: Come with us to the gathering of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, for I want to divorce Al-Nawar and make him witness against myself. They said: Do not do it, for perhaps your soul will follow her and you will regret. He said: It must be done. So they went with him. When he stood over Al-Hasan, he said: O Abu Sa'id, know that Al-Nawar is divorced thrice. He said: I have heard. Then his soul followed her after that and he regretted and recited saying:\n(Wafir Meter)\nI regretted the regret of Al-Kusa'i when ... Al-Nawar went from me divorced.\nShe was my Paradise, so I left it ... Like Adam when necessity expelled him.\nAnd if I owned my hand and my soul ... The choice would have been mine against destiny.\nThen he said: And the Arabs say: If I were given choice I would have chosen; bearing it on destiny. And they recite:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nIt is the decrees, so blame me or leave ... If I erred, destiny did not err.\nThen he put his sandals together and said: You are the mask for the Qadari. So I reduced my visits to him.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us, he said: Tha'lab recited to us:\n(Ramal Meter)\nAnd how many things we buy with money ... So if they perish (nafaqat), they are the most stagnant (aksad) things to be.\nHe said: He means horses. 'Nashriha': We buy them. 'Nafaqat': Died.\n\nAl-Yazidi informed us, he said: Abd al-Rahman bin akhi Al-Asma'i recited to us from his uncle:\n(Kamil Meter)\nThey said: Be consoled, so I despaired, for you will not attain her ... Until the sweetness of the bitter tree (Al-Amr) becomes bitter.\nWe are not of the Muta'azzimin (those humbled by hard times) when ... The touchstone reveals the established poverty.\nHe says: You will not attain her until what cannot be happens. It is said: 'Amara ash-shay'u yamurru fahuwa mumirrun', and 'Marra mararatan fahuwa murrun'. 'Al-Muta'azzimun': Those humbling themselves to the difficulty of the year (famine). 'Al-Lamusan': When his lineage is touched, weakness is found in it, so he rejoices in the difficulty of time to desire and marry one who is nobler than him. So he says: We are not of those who do this and feign status by the severity of time.\n\nAl-Zajjaj recited to us, he said: Al-Mubarrad recited to us by Al-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf:\n(Kamil Meter)\nO you who corresponds with me then changes his heart ... I will restrain myself before he becomes bored.\nI will turn away from you while in my hand is a remnant ... Of the rope of your connection before it is cut.\nO for hope! Like two lovers who agreed ... So we spoke without speaking.\nUntil when they feared eyes and were wary ... They made signaling with fingers a peace (greeting).\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Hatim informed us, he said: Abu Ubayda informed us from Yunus bin Habib, he said: Mus'ab bin al-Zubayr killed Nabil bin Zabyan, one of Banu Aish bin Malik bin Qays bin Tha'labah. His brother Ubaydullah was a recluse, evil. He vowed to kill a hundred of Quraysh for him. He killed eighty, then killed Mus'ab. His head was brought to Abd al-Malik. When Abd al-Malik looked at him, he prostrated. He intended to kill him (Ubaydullah) treacherously, then refrained and recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nI intended but did not do, and almost, and would that I ... Left Marwan's wives weeping over him.\nHe also said:\n(Tawil Meter)\nMus'ab thinks I forgot what happened to me ... And by the life of Allah, it is not what Mus'ab thought.\nBy Allah, I will not forget him as long as a night star passes ... And as long as a star shines in the dark night.\nHe leaped upon him unjustly so I killed him ... So your rain from me on a day of evil is pouring.\nI killed for him from the tribe of Fihr bin Malik ... Eighty, among them arrows (Nashibun) and gray-haired.\nAnd sufficient for them is a pledge for twenty, or is seen ... Upon me with the morning wailing women wearing mourning clothes.\nDo I raise my head in the midst of Bakr bin Wa'il ... And I did not quench my sword with blood pouring down?\nThen Basra became narrow for him, so he fled to Oman and sought refuge with Sulayman bin Sa'id bin Al-Samr bin Sa'id Al-Julandi. When he was informed of his treachery, he feared and blamed himself to kill him publicly. So he sent him half a melon which he had poisoned, as he liked melon. He said to him: This is the first thing we saw of melon, and I ate half of it, and gifted you half of it. When he ate it, he sensed death. Then Sulayman entered upon him to visit him. He said: O Emir, come close to me so I may confide a saying to you. He said to him: Say what appears to you. He said: Upon you regarding Oman is a conscious ear (Wa'iyah). It is narrated: Caring (Ra'iyah). So he died there.",

    "text": "Abu al-Qasim al-Zajjaji informed us: 'An-Nuh' is the plural of 'Na'ihah' (wailing woman), and it is a verbal noun 'Yanuhu' used for singular, dual, plural, masculine, and feminine with one wording, as it is said: 'Qawm Rida' and 'Adl' and 'Sawm', and 'Niswah Rida' and 'Sawm' and 'Adl'. 'As-Salab': Those who wore 'Al-Silabah' which is black clothes. He brought out its verb for emphasis carried on the wording of 'Nuh'. The poet said:\n(Kamil Meter)\nDo my camels scratch their faces over me ... Or bind their heads with mourning clothes (Silab)?\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us from Ibn al-A'rabi, he said: It is said: 'La'ibtu' and 'La'abtu', two dialects. And it is said: 'Abithtu a'bathu', the past is 'Al-Abath' like 'Alimtu a'lamu'. And 'Abathtu a'bathu' from 'Al-Abithah' which is a type of 'Aqit' meaning milk. He said: And it is said: 'Sharata al-hajjamu yashritu' and 'Ashrata', and in other than it 'Yashritu' only. He said: 'Al-Qadd': Cutting lengthwise, and 'Al-Qatt': Cutting crosswise. It is narrated about Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, that if he rose over a man he 'Qaddahu' (cut lengthwise), and if he intercepted him he 'Qattahu' (cut crosswise).\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us from Tha'lab from Al-Riyashi from Al-Asma'i, he said: The Ravens of the Arabs (Aghrabat al-Arab - black poets) are three: Khufaf bin Nadbah al-Sulami, and Nadbah is his mother, she was a black Abyssinian woman from Banu al-Harith bin Ka'b, and his father was Umayr bin al-Harith bin Amr bin al-Sharid. And Sulayk bin al-Sulakah is his mother, and his father was Yathrabi bin Sayyar. And Antara bin Muawiyah al-Absi. He said: I have not narrated poetry softer than the saying of Khufaf:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAsma' did not knock (visit in dream) without a cause ... And indeed, if she settles in Najran, we meet.\nWith a reveal (Bi-bawhin), and what is my mind with a reveal and her mind ... And whoever meets one day the confusion of love palpitates.\n\nAl-Husayn bin Isma'il al-Mahamili told us, he said: Abu Hashim Ziyad bin Ayyub al-Tusi told us, he said: Sa'id bin Muhammad al-Warraq told us from Bassam bin Ikrimah from Ibn Abbas, he said: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade the milk of the 'Jallalah', the dowry of the prostitute, and the price of the dog.\nAbu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Jallalah': The camel that eats dung. The origin of 'Al-Jallalah' is dung (Ba'r). It is said: The slave girls went out 'Yajtalilna' (collecting dung). 'Al-Bigha'': The immoral woman. 'Al-Bigha'': Adultery. Allah Almighty said: (And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution (Al-Bigha')). 'Al-Baghy' in other than this verse is the slave girl. 'Al-Baghiah': The scout (Rabi'ah), who is the vanguard for the people. Al-Asma'i recited:\n(Tawil Meter)\nAnd there was behind the people a scout (Baghiah) from them ... So he ascended a high place from afar and announced.\n\nIsma'il al-Warraq told us, he said: Al-Husayn bin Muhammad told us, he said: Shamah bin Suwar told us, he said: Furat bin al-Sa'ib told us from Maymun bin Mahran from Ibn Umar, he said: The first to enter upon Umar when he was struck were Ali and Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them. When Ibn Abbas looked at him, he wept and said: Rejoice with Paradise, O Commander of the Faithful. He said: Are you a witness for me of that? He seemed to hesitate, so Ali struck him and said: Yes, bear witness for him, and I am of the witnesses to that. Umar said: How? Ibn Abbas said: Your Islam was glory, your rule was justice, and your death is martyrdom. He said: No, by Allah, do not console me from my Lord and my religion - or he said religion, Al-Za'farani doubted - Umar's mother be bereaved of him if his Lord does not forgive him.\nIt is said: 'Ka'a 'an al-amr fahuwa ka'i'': If he hesitated from it out of cowardice and fear. As for 'Al-'Akk': Intensity of heat. It is said: 'Yawm 'Akk wa 'Akik', and 'Akk wa Akik': If it is intensely hot. 'Al-'Ukwak' among men: The short, strong of build. 'Al-'Akanka'': Male of the ghouls (Sa'ali). Al-Khalil recited:\n(Split Rajaz Meter)\nA ghoul disputing with a wicked Akanka'.\n\nNiftawayh informed us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi, he said: It is said for the turban: It is 'Al-Imamah', 'Al-Mishwadh', 'As-Sib', 'Al-Muqatta'ah', 'Al-Isabah', 'Al-Isab', 'At-Taj', and 'Al-Iqti'az' which is for a man to turban himself without passing it under the chin (Tahannuk). In the Hadith, he forbade 'Al-Iqti'az' and ordered 'At-Talahhi' (Tahannuk). He also mentioned that he said: The man came 'Mutakhattiman' i.e., turbaned, and how beautiful is his 'Takhattum' i.e., his turbaning. This is a word no one narrated except Ibn al-A'rabi.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us, he said: Al-Mubarrad recited to us:\n(Majzu' al-Kamil Meter)\nMan hopes to live, and length of life harms him.\nHis cheerfulness vanishes and remains, after the sweet of life, its bitter.\nAnd days betray him until he sees nothing that pleases him.\nHow many a gloater over me if I perish, and sayer: To Allah is his goodness (derision/praise depending on context).\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us, he said: Al-Riyashi informed us, he said: Abd al-Qahir bin al-Sari informed us, he said: Qutayba bin Muslim obtained a shirt woven with pearls, so he sent it to Al-Hajjaj, who sent it to Al-Walid. Then Al-Hajjaj's soul followed it (desired it), so he wrote to Qutayba: As for what follows, we had sent what you sent to us to Al-Walid, and I reckon you have kept the like of it with you for your wives and daughters, so prefer us with what is with you of it. So he wrote to him: \"That I eat carrion, blood, pig meat, and what was dedicated to other than Allah is dearer to me than that I withhold a valuable thing ('Alaq) from you.\" So he wrote to him: That is the opinion of you.",

    "text": "Niftawayh informed us, he said: Ishaq bin Muhammad told us, he said: Al-Hasan bin Muhammad told us from Shayban from Qatada regarding the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic (And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned; but He pardons much). He said: It was mentioned to us that the Prophet of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: No scratch of a stick strikes the son of Adam, nor a stumble of a foot, nor a twitch of a vein, except due to a sin, and what Allah pardons is more. And with his chain from Qatada (And do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread... the verse). He said: This is a parable Allah struck for one who breaks his covenant. He says: If you heard of a woman who untwisted her spun thread after twisting it firmly, would you not say: How foolish is this one? What others besides Qatada go to is that they were forbidden from disbelief after Islam so they wouldn't be like she who untwisted her spun thread after twisting it firmly. The singular of 'Ankath' is 'Nikth': It is what is untwisted from tents and clothes to be spun a second time and returned with the new.\n\nNiftawayh informed us, he said: Ishaq bin Muhammad told us from Al-Hasan from Muhammad from Shayban, he said from Qatada regarding the saying of Allah Almighty (Perhaps you would kill yourself (Bakhi'un nafsaka)). He said: Killer of yourself. Niftawayh said: Tha'lab said: It is said: 'Bakha'a Fulanun Fulanan': If he killed him. 'Bakha'a bi-hi': If he exaggerated in blaming him. 'Bakha'a Fulanun wa Jatha'a': If he humiliated himself and submitted. It is recited for Dhu al-Rumma:\n(Tawil Meter)\nO you who kills himself (Al-Bakhi'u) with grief ... For a thing fates have carved from his hands.\n\nAbu Muhammad Abdullah bin Malit al-Nahwi al-Darir informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed me from Umar bin Shabbah, he said: Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan had a spy in the lands of the Romans. He said: So he wrote to him: That this tyrant said in his assembly that this is a time to eradicate the Arabs because they have differed. So Muawiyah wrote a letter to him swearing to him and saying: If you resolve on what you showed in your assembly, I will surely reconcile with my companion (Ali) and I will surely be his vanguard against you, so I will make you descend the Constantinople of the Jaramiqah and I will return you to being a farmer (Arlasiyyan) as you used to herd piglets (Khananis). The King of the Romans wrote to him swearing to him by innocence from baptism and entering into Hanifiyyah (Islam) that he did not intend this nor spoke it, and he gifted him many gifts, most of which was 'Al-Yuzbun' (hyssop?). With Damma on Ya, and Kasra is wrong. It is narrated from Tha'lab that he said: 'Al-Arlas': The Akadir (farmers/peasants). I reckon it is not Arabic and perhaps it is in the language of the people. 'Al-Khananis': Piglets, singular 'Khannus'.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad informed us from Al-Mazini from Al-Asma'i, he said: Buthayna was nicknamed Umm Abd al-Malik. When Jamil's fame with her and his passion for her increased and their matter escalated, her family threatened him and menaced him, and swore that if they caught him they would kill him. So he said regarding that:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nO Umm Abd al-Malik, cut me off ... So clarify my cutting off or connect me.\nIndeed the sons of your uncle threatened me ... That they would kill me, then they would not pay blood money for me.\nLo, by the Lord of the House, if they met me ... Paired and odd, they would have feared me.\nThe enemies have known that before me ... Is a striking like the driving of the black pregnant camels.\nThen he went out to Egypt and died there. When death approached him, he recited saying:\n(Kamil Meter)\nThe announcer of death came early and did not use a kunya for Jamil ... And he stayed in Egypt a stay with no return.\nRise, Buthayna, and mourn with wailing ... And weep for your friend above every friend.\nAnd indeed I dragged the garment in Wadi al-Qura ... Intoxicated among farms and palms.\nWhen these verses reached Buthayna, she said two verses, and she had never said poetry before them nor after them other than them, and they are:\n(Tawil Meter)\nIt is equal to us, O Jamil bin Ma'mar ... When you die, the hardships of life and its softness.\nAnd indeed my silence regarding Jamil for an hour ... Of time has not come nor has its time arrived.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi:\n(Wafir Meter)\nIs she weeping, afflicted, if an announcer comes to her ... Or will she have patience?\nWhen the people of affection bid me farewell ... And departed with dust on their palms.\nLeave him and my bones in the niche of a grave ...

He said to him: Are you the one who claims that Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn are the sons of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him? You will bring me it from the Book of Allah or I will cut off your hands and feet. He said: I will bring you it from the Book of Allah Almighty. Then he recited: (And of his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the doers of good. And Zechariah and John and Jesus). So He made Jesus of his descendants, and he has no father.\n\nAbd al-Aziz bin Ali bin al-Muntasir recited to us, he said: Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz recited to me for himself:\n(Kamil Meter)\nMy heart wanders in the beauty of his image ... Where sickness is by the glance of his eye.\nAs if the scorpion of his temple (curl) stood ... When it approached the fire of his cheek.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Hatim and Abd al-Rahman bin akhi Al-Asma'i both informed us from Al-Asma'i, he said: I was on a journey, and in one of the resting places a boy stood over us and said: Which of you is a man from the people of Basra? We said to him: What do you want from him? He said: Indeed my master is dying from what is in him, and he wants to entrust his will to him. So I got up with him, and behold, it was Al-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf, breathing his last, having thrown himself on wet mud. I sat at his head, so he raised his glance to me. When he recognized me, he recited saying:\n(Madid Meter)\nO one far from home, away from his homeland ... Alone weeping over his sorrow.\nWhenever the escape became serious with him ... Illnesses became serious in his body.\nThen he fainted, and did not wake up except by the sound of a turtledove on the branch of a tree near him. So he recited saying:\n(Madid Meter)\nAnd indeed, the heart increased in sadness ... The voice of a turtledove on its branch.\nIt was afflicted by what afflicted me, so it wept ... Each of us weeping over his dwelling.\nThen he passed away, so I took charge of his funeral preparations.\n\nAl-Zajjaj recited to us from Al-Mubarrad:\n(Tawil Meter)\nSo we spent the night just above the tribe, we were not of them ... And we were not mixed with the enemies.\nAnd we spent the night shielding against the falling dew and moisture ... Of the night, a garment whose lining was tar.\nWe ransom with the remembrance of Allah in the essence of His House ... When a wandering heart was [smitten] by a Jinan (garden/shield/madness?).\nAnd we return from the attire of chastity, and perhaps ... We quenched the burning of longing with sipping.\nAbu al-Abbas said: He took the meanings of these verses from the saying of Imru' al-Qays:\nI sent to her while the stars were setting ... Fearing for her that she might rise and hear.\nSo she came, slow of walk, fearing the night travel ... Her corners pushing four buxom maidens.\nThey drive her, the walk of the drained one, and the dregs ... Of sleep had run in her brain so it was cut.\nShe says, and I had stripped her of her clothes ... Concealing what the kohl-eyed, long-necked one grazes.\nBy your grandfather, if anything came to us as his messenger ... Other than you, but we found no repulsion for you.\nThen we would have returned him, even if his stay was long ... With us, but we are fond of your love.\nSo we spent the night repelling the wild beasts from us as if we were ... Two slain ones whose death place the people did not know.\nIf the tremor of fear seized her, she held on ... To the shoulder of a bold one, fearless in terror.\n\nAbu Abdullah al-Yazidi informed us, he said: Al-Yazidi informed us from Al-Asma'i from Abdullah bin Ru'ba bin al-Ajjaj from his father from his grandfather, he said: I recited to Abu Hurayrah my poem which begins:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nPraise be to Allah, by whose permission the sky rose ... And by whose permission the earth settled, so it did not suffer.\nAnd He extended it with anchors (mountains), fixed ... And revealed to it the settlement, so it settled.\nUntil I reached its end, he said: I bear witness that you are a believer.\n\nAbu Abdullah al-Akhfash and Al-Yazidi informed us, they said: Tha'lab told us from Al-Riyashi from Al-Asma'i, he said: Nafi' bin Abi Nu'aym told me, he said: Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf said to Nafi' bin Jubayr: Strike the neck of this man who is before him (me?). He said: Indeed my hand is 'Tabaqah'. He said: Then leave us. So he left, and a messenger followed him with two hundred dinars saying: The Emir says to you, seek help with this in your journey.\nAl-Asma'i said: It is said a hand is 'Tabaqah' and 'Tabiqah': If it sticks to the pocket (side) and does not strike.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Ibn Mu'adh Khalaf bin Ahmar told us from Dummad bin Rafi' from Abu Ubayda Ma'mar bin al-Muthanna, he said: Yazid bin al-Hakam al-Thaqafi arrived from Ta'if to Al-Hajjaj in Iraq, and he was a noble poet. So he appointed him over Fars. When he came to take his covenant (appointment), he said to him: O Yazid, recite to us from your poetry. So he recited saying:\n(Wafir Meter)\nAnd whoever asks about me, then I ... Am the son of the hunters (lions/nobles) from my ancestors of Thaqif.\nAnd in the middle of the valleys is the place of my house ... The place of the lion in the middle of the thicket.",

    "text": "And in Ka'b, and who is like the tribe Ka'b ... I settled in the peak of lofty glory.\nI loved its pride, lowland and highland ... And that is the utmost honor of the noble.\nEvery proud one traced my lineage, neither weak ... To carry burdens, nor violent.\nAl-Hajjaj was struck dumb and lowered his head for a while, then raised his head and said: Praise be to Allah, I praise Him and thank Him that a time has not come except that the most poetic of Arabs is among us. Then he said: Recite to us, O Yazid. So he recited saying:\n(Kamil Meter)\nBy my father who conquered the lands with his sword ... And humbled the past sons of time to it.\nAnd by my father who stripped the son of Kisra of a banner ... In the kingdom, flapping like the flying eagle.\nAnd if I boast, I boast not denied ... A boast by which I crush the boast of the boaster.\nAl-Hajjaj stood up angry and entered the palace. Yazid left with the covenant in his hand. Al-Hajjaj said to his servant: Follow him and tell him: Return our covenant to us. If you take it, say to him: Did your father bequeath you the like of this? The servant did so and conveyed the message. He returned the covenant to him and said: Say to Al-Hajjaj: My father bequeathed to me his glory and deeds, and your father bequeathed to you goats in Ta'if to herd. Then he traveled under the night and joined Sulayman (bin Abd al-Malik), who was the Crown Prince. He joined him to himself and made him part of his entourage. He said praising Sulayman:\n(Basit Meter)\nIf the beautiful women walk away from me turning aside ...

Then our appointment with them might be a feast (Eid).\nWe all meet, distracted with his companion ... And we do not fear refutation from the blamers.\nSay to youth when gray hair chases it ... Do not distance the chased one of gray hair, chased.\nWhoever accompanies gray hair, it hates him and drags for him ...

Most intense of them in asceticism in it and making others ascetic.\nIf people have become stagnant (in market) ...

This is the Prophet of Guidance, he was envied.\nThe wicked ones who opposed you from Kalb bit ... The rocks and the hard deaf stones (Sayahid).\nYou were named the name of a man whose character you resembled ... In justice and virtue, Solomon son of David.\nPraise him, there was a king among the past ones ... And you have become praised among the remaining ones.\n\nAbu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Gharif': The thicket, and likewise 'Al-Ghabah', 'Al-Khis', and 'Al-Qabil'. 'Al-Gharaf': A tree used for tanning. 'Al-Mu'dilat': Plural of 'Mu'dilah', which are difficult matters. From it 'Addalat al-mar'ah': If her child got stuck during birth and did not come out. 'Addala ar-rajul ibnatahu': If he prevented her from marrying. 'Al-'Udal': The severe disease with no cure. 'Al-Munif': The overlooking/high. 'Al-'Anif': Opposite of gentle. His saying: 'Tarahunna suwaran nahwana': It is the plural of 'Aswar' and 'Sur': i.e., leaning towards us, from your saying 'Saraftu ash-shay'': If you bent it and inclined it. 'As-Sid': Plural of 'Asyad' and 'Sayda'', which are those tilting their necks out of pride. Its origin is from 'As-Sayad': A disease in the camel's neck tilting it to a side. 'Al-Akhashib': Plural of 'Akhshab', which is the thick mountain. 'As-Salb': Whetstones.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us by Ibn al-Mu'tazz:\n(Khafif Meter)\nA magician of the eyes, showed avoidance ... Allah crafted him in beauty, unique.\nA lover called to my heart by breaking his eyelids ... The soul found no escape from his separation.\nMay Allah have mercy on one who wept, infatuated ... It is not decreed for his heart to be returned.\nHe spends the night wailing over one who ... Grew roses of beauty upon his cheeks.\n\nIbn al-Anbari recited to us by Ibn al-Mu'tazz:\n(Basit Meter)\nMay Allah not give sleep to the one who gifted me sleeplessness ... And deposited the fire of love in the heart, so it burned.\nA full moon exposed himself to me deliberately to kill me ... His lights drive away the dusk from his face.\nVarying in him from parting (of hair) to foot ... Are novel beauties that arrest the eyes.\nSo how many a mind was bewildered and how many a look ...

Hasten my release or catch the last breath.\nLonging, since you were hidden from my sight, has not left ... A character for me in patience nor a creation.\nAnd creation erased a promise I was hoping for ... And my despair blocked the roads against my hopes.\nI was not the first servant raising his hand ...

    "text": "Pushing his sleeve in a walk playfully ... He does not fear rage or anger for my blood.\nHe turned a curl on his cheek adorning it ... And they earned his collar a ring from his hair.\n\nIssue in the Quran\nThe saying of the Mighty and Majestic: (Then We will surely extract from every sect which of them (Ayyuhum) is most intense against the Most Merciful in insolence). There are six opinions in it, three for the Basrans and three for the Kufans.\nSibawayh said: 'Ayyuhum' here is in the interpretation of 'Alladhi' (who), and it is in the place of Nasb (Accusative) by the occurrence of extraction (Naz') upon it, but it is built on Damma because it is connected with a single name (Mufrad - as predicate without the copula 'huwa'). If it were connected with a sentence, it would be declinable. 'Ashaddu' is the predicate of a hidden inchoative (Mubtada) estimated as 'huwa ashaddu'. 'Itiyyan' is accusative as specification (Tamyiz). If the Mubtada were shown, 'Ayy' would be installed (Accusative) and it would be said: 'La-nanza'anna min kulli shi'atin ayyahum huwa ashaddu'.\nAl-Khalil said: This is based on imitation (Hikayah), as if it was said to them: 'We will surely extract from every sect the one who it is said they are most intense.' Sibawayh said this is wrong and compelled him to allow 'La-adribanna al-fasiqu al-khabithu' (I will surely strike the corrupt the wicked - Nominative) on the estimation 'I will surely strike the one who it is said he is the wicked.'\nYunus said: The verb is nullified (Mulgha) and 'Ayy' is raised by inchoation and 'Ashaddu' is its predicate, as it is said 'Alimtu ayyuhum 'indaka' (I knew which of them is with you). Sibawayh said: This is also wrong because only verbs of doubt and certainty like 'Zhanantu' and 'Alimtu' and their category can be nullified. And it is as he said.\nAl-Farra' said: 'Then We will surely extract from every sect which of them is most intense.' i.e., We will surely extract by calling, so they will be called by 'which of them is most intense.' He has another opinion in this, which is that he said: It is possible that the saying falls on the place of 'Man ashaddu'. He has a third opinion in it, he said: It is possible that its meaning is 'Then We will surely extract from those who followed each other and supported each other by following, which of them is most intense,' so 'Ayy' would be in the connection of the following (Tashayu').\nAbu al-Qasim said: The best of these opinions is Sibawayh's opinion, and the other opinion from Al-Farra' which we ended the issue with.\n\nIssue of Connections (Silat)\nKnow that 'Alladhi', 'Man', 'Ma', 'Ayy', and Alif-Lam are incomplete nouns in the report that are not complete except with a connection (Silah) and a returner (A'id), and on other than definite, except 'Ayy' alone which is declinable. These nouns were not declinable because they are incomplete, not complete except with a connection and returner, so they became like some letters of the noun, and parts of letters do not deserve inflection; rather the noun deserves inflection in its entirety. Also, when they became ambiguous, they resembled in their ambiguity the particles of meaning indicative of what they were placed for with common indication. When these nouns resembled particles, they were not inflected due to their resemblance to what is not inflected like it. If you dualize 'Alladhi' alone, you inflect it and say: 'Al-ladhani fi ad-dar akhawaka', and 'Marartu bi-alladhayni 'indaka'. It was only inflected in the dual because it separated from particles of meaning, because particles of meaning are not dualized or pluralized. Therefore, all indeclinable nouns that allow dualization become declinable if dualized. If you pluralize 'Alladhi', among the Arabs are those who use the singular form for the plural and do not inflect it, saying: 'Alladhi fi ad-dar az-Zayduna'. Allah Almighty said: (And the one who brought the truth and [those who] believed in it - those are the righteous) and He said: (Their example is like the example of the one who kindled a fire; then when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light). Some of them make it in the plural form and do not inflect it, saying: 'Ra'aytu alladhina 'indaka', and 'Ja'ani alladhina 'indaka', saying it is a plural on the pattern of the dual, so it became like a single noun applying to the plural, so it was not inflected. Some of them inflect it and make it a sound plural, saying: 'Ja'ani alladhuna 'indaka', and 'Marartu bi-alladhina 'indaka', and 'Ra'aytu alladhina 'indaka'. The poet said in this dialect:\n(Kamil Meter)\nAnd Banu Nuwayjiyah, those who (Alladhuna) are like ... Striped coats pierced from the Khazzan.\nIf it is said: Why is 'Ayy' inflected in the report while it is an incomplete noun needing a connection and returner as 'Alladhi' and its sisters need, and 'Alladhi' and its sisters were not inflected? The answer is: 'Ayy' is a noun that became empowered by addition (Idafa) so it was inflected because its meaning is not understood except by what it is added to. What it was added to brought it out by addition to empowerment, so it was inflected. Do you not see that 'Amsi' (yesterday) is built on Kasra, but if you add it, you inflect it and say: 'Mada amsuka bi-ma fihi' (Your yesterday passed with what was in it), and 'Qad kana amsuna atyaba min yawmina'. Similarly 'Ayy', when added, became empowered and inflected, then it was singularized, so its singular was carried on that and inflected because inflection was established in it before its singularization.\nIf he says: Why were 'Alladhi', 'Man', 'Ma', and the rest of the incomplete nouns not added? The answer is: 'Alladhi' is defined by Alif-Lam, and addition does not combine with it. 'Man' and 'Ma' are more ambiguous than 'Alladhi' because they can be interrogative resembling the interrogative Alif, and conditional resembling the conditional particle, so they became like 'Huwa' in ambiguity compared to 'Ayy', so their addition was not permissible. Therefore, they were not dualized, pluralized, or feminized as was done with 'Alladhi'. So know that.",

    "text": "Ibn al-Anbari informed us, he said: Al-Khattali informed us, he said: Abu Ya'la al-Saji told us, he said: Al-Asma'i told us, he said: Sufyan bin Uyaynah told us, he said: Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The command of Allah is not established except by one who does not flatter (Yusani'), nor show weakness (Yudari'), nor follow greed.\nHis saying 'Yudari'': From 'Dhara'ah' which is weakness. It is said: 'Dhari'a ar-rajulu yadhra'u dhar'an wa dhara'atan': If he became weak. A man 'Dhari'', a people 'Dhari'', and women likewise. 'Ad-Dar'': Also the young animal. 'Al-Mudara'ah' in other than this: Resemblance. Al-Zajjaj said: Its derivation is from 'Ad-Dar'' (udder). It is said 'Tadara'a al-fasilani': If they drank from one udder, which is 'Al-Khilf'. This is metaphorical.\n\nIbn al-Anbari informed us, he said: Al-Khattali informed us from Abu Ya'la from Al-Asma'i, he said: Sufyan bin Uyaynah told us, Ali, peace be upon him, said: If you learn knowledge, then restrain it (Akzhimu 'alayhi) and do not mix it with play or jest, lest hearts reject it.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: My uncle Al-Husayn bin Duraid informed us from his father, he said: Hisham bin Muhammad al-Kalbi told us from his father Al-Kalbi and from Abu Miskin and from Abd al-Rahman bin al-Mu'arra Abu Husayn Zuhair al-Dawsi, he said: Hamamah bin Rafi' bin al-Harith al-Dawsi was one of the most beautiful of Arabs. He had a lock of hair called 'Al-Ratbah'. He used to wash it with water, then it would absorb it, retaining the water. When two days passed, he would untie it then undo it, and it would fill a sitting mat with water. He performed Hajj on a horse of his with a long tail. Al-Hamamah al-Kinaniyyah, who is Khunas, looked at him, and she was one of the most beautiful women, so he fell into her heart. She was married to a man from Kinanah called Ibn al-Humaris al-Kinani. She said to Hamamah: Who are you? By Allah, I do not know if your face is more beautiful, or your hair, or your horse. You are not the disheveled Najdi nor the dirty Tihami, and you have fallen into my soul, so tell me the truth? He said: I am a man from Azd then from Daws, and my home is in Tharuq. She said: Then you are the most beloved of people to me, so carry me with you. So he put her behind him and went with her to his family. When he brought her to his land, he said to them: You have known how your proximity was with me, and by Allah, you will not approach a man after me. So he cut her hamstrings (disabled her from marrying/leaving?), and she stayed with him. She bore Amr bin Hamamah, and he was a generous master. Amr begot Dhu al-Nur who came as a delegate to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and asked him for a sign to be for him to return to his people and call them to faith. He was given a light between his eyes like a shining lamp. He said: O Allah, in other than my face. Lest my people think it is a mutilation for leaving their religion. So He placed that light in the tip of his whip, in a long Hadith. So he was named Dhu al-Nur for that.\nIbn al-Humaris went out seeking his wife Khunas but could not find her, and he recited saying:\n(Wafir Meter)\nLo, greet Al-Khunas despite her hatred ... And even if she has gone far and her distance is remote.\nShe exchanged the watermelon and the land of Daws ... For Jumlat Faris, whose peaks are protected.\nAnd I was informed she hungered and was humiliated ... And that the free woman is from a mountain that leveled her.\nAnd I was informed she sifted a caravan ... And flowers whose thorns were stripped.\nAnd I was informed she gave birth to a boy ... So may the boy not survive nor give her joy.\nWhen Umar bin al-Khattab recited this poetry, he said: By Allah, the boy survived and gave her joy.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us, he said: Tha'lab recited to us, he said: Ibn al-A'rabi recited to us:\n(Basit Meter)\nLike the tick (Baram), he appeared in a worn shirt ... Not shaving his pubes, while the causes of death cover him.\nSo I returned from him with a herd of camels for a widow ... And a miserable one whose meaning came like his meaning.\nIbn al-A'rabi said: describing a beggar. He said: He is like the 'Baram', meaning the tick (Qurad), likened to it for his skinniness and slenderness. It is said: It is 'Al-Qurad', 'Al-Baram', 'At-Tammah', 'Al-'All', 'Al-Qirsham', 'Al-Hajn', 'Al-Hamnah', 'Al-Hamnanah', and 'Al-Hashdal'. The Lam is extra. He said: From it is 'Al-Hasad' (Envy), as if envy sticks to the human heart as the tick sticks to the camel's skin and sucks it. He said: As for his saying \"Ghada fi asdati khalaqin\", 'Al-Asdah' is 'As-Sadrah' (vest/shirt). It is said: It is 'As-Sadrah', 'Al-Asrah', 'Al-Mijwal', 'Al-Baqir', 'Al-Khay'al', 'Al-Fad'ah', 'Al-'Alaqah', and 'Al-Itb', all with one meaning. His saying \"Lam yasta'in\": Did not shave his pubic hair. \"Hawami al-mawt\": Its causes, originally 'Hawa'im' then inverted. \"Bi-sara'ayna\": Many camels differing in walk due to their number. 'Al-Mashy' is plural of 'Mashyah'.\n\nNiftawayh recited to us:\n(Tawil Meter)\nIf the messenger came to me announcing her death ... I secluded myself where I was on the earth.\nAnd I weep for myself out of mercy for her weeping ... And some of me weeps over some due to abandonment.\nAnd indeed I love her despite her bad action ... And I decree upon myself regarding her with what I decree.\nSo until when will the spirit of passion not reach me ... And until when will the days of your anger not pass?",

And the broad valleys flowed with the necks of the mounts.\n\nNiftawayh informed us, he said: Al-Husayn bin Ishaq bin Ishaq bin al-Hasan informed us, he said: Al-Husayn bin Muhammad told us from Shayban from Qatada regarding the Almighty's saying: (Wa 'indahum qasirat at-tarf) (And with them are women limiting their glances). i.e., restraining the glance from looking at other than their husbands. 'Al-Qasr' is also: The evening, which is 'Al-Qasr' then 'Al-Qasar', and after it 'At-Tifl'. 'Tafalat ash-shamsu': If it approached setting. After it is 'Al-Junuh', which is when it inclines in the horizon of the west. It is said: 'Qasruka an taf'ala kadha', 'Qasaruka', 'Qasraka', and 'Qasarak'.\n\nNiftawayh informed us, he said: Ishaq bin al-Hasan told us from Al-Husayn bin Muhammad from Shayban from Qatada regarding the Almighty's saying: (And is this a favor of which you remind me - that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?). He said: Moses, peace be upon him, said to Pharaoh when he enumerated his upbringing and being with him: Do you remind me of favor because you took the Children of Israel as slaves while they were free people? It is said: 'Abbadtu ar-rajula' with Shadda on Ba, and 'A'badtuhu': If you took him as a slave and placed him in the status of slaves. The poet said:\n(Basit Meter)\nWhy does my people enslave me when there are many ... Camels among them, whatever they wish, and slaves?\n'An-Ni'mah' with Kasra on Nun: The hand (favor). 'An-Na'am' with Fatha on the first: Prosperity. It is said: 'Manna Fulanun 'ala Fulan': If he did him a favor and was good to him. 'Manna Fulanun 'ala Fulan': If he reminded him of his favor and kindness and reproached him with it. From it is said: The bane of kindness is 'Al-Mann' meaning reminding. They said regarding the Almighty's saying (Wa la tamnun tastakthir): Do not give to take more than what you give, and let your giving be for Allah Almighty.\n\nAl-Akhfash informed us, he said: Tha'lab informed us from Al-Riyashi, he said: Abu Salamah al-Ghafari told us, he said: Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Uthman bin Affan said to me: Our mother Fatima bint al-Husayn bin Ali gathered us and said: O my sons, by Allah, the people of foolishness have not said anything in their pleasures with foolishness except that the people of chivalry have said the like of it or more with their chivalry, so cover yourselves with the covering of Allah.\n\nAl-Yazidi informed us from his uncle Abu al-Qasim Ubaydullah bin Muhammad, he said: Salm al-Khasir entered upon Al-Fadl bin al-Rabi'. When he stood before him, he recited saying:\n(Mujtath Meter)\nHe sleeps who does not stay awake ... Would that this morning would shine.\nIs this not strange ... I die at times and am resurrected?\nA resurrection every day ... For a youth who is not gathered.\nAllah is my sufficiency and Fadl ... So I do not fear nor dread.\nFadl has hands with me ... And a favor not to be denied.\nIf my praise is much ... Then Fadl's giving is more.\nHe said: Ask your need. He said: Connect me to the Commander of the Faithful, Al-Rashid. He said: I will. And he ordered him five hundred dinars. He was to ride to the House (Palace), so he was carried with him. When he entered upon the Caliph and people took their seats, he said to some servants:",

    "text": "Bring in Salm. When he entered, Al-Rashid asked permission to recite, and he permitted him. He said:\n(Majzu' al-Ramal Meter)\nLet us hear or inform us ... O dwellings of the departing ones.\nIndeed my heart is a hostage to you ... For that which you know.\nThe days called out in it ... With decay until we decayed.\nHow often we trod amusement in the house ... Types and arts.\nOf gazelles, their buttocks ... Attract the backs (riders).\nHeavy ones, swaying in it ... Houris and wide-eyed.\nFlashes of longing from it ... Resurrection the buried disease.\nHe won in intimacy, a lover ... Who was stingy with intimacy.\nThe more I increased in distance ... He increased in love, fascination.\nShe left in my heart ... Burns that do not end.\nThere is no resting place for sleep ... In the eyes of lovers.\nThe sea of love became a flood ... After we waded it for a time.\nIndeed Abdullah Harun ... Is the Commander of the Faithful.\nA king who spread his gifts ... Left and right.\nIndeed, to Allah is a guardian gathering ... World and religion.\nHe gives the world but ... Prevents the protected religion.\nA king who became, to what was mighty ... Of the world, humiliating.\nYou are the best of people living ... And the son of the best of those gone.\nMany a day for deaths ... We meet, red and black.\nLike the Day of Gathering, casting ... The marked brave ones.\nMothers of wild beasts in it ... Do not have mercy on a fetus.\nAnd handkerchiefs (weapons) of deaths ... In the hands of unsheathing ones.\nIf you called war a slave ... And enslaved death.\nThe gifts of peace obediently ... Following or submissive.\nAl-Rashid said to Al-Fadl: O Fadl, give him. He said: What, O Commander of the Faithful? He said: Give him ten thousand dirhams and carry him on three horses (Thalathin min al-khayl). His saying 'Ala thalathin' (on three - feminine form), he dropped the Ha because 'Al-Khayl' (horses) is feminine, so the number in it is carried on the word, masculine or feminine. You say: 'Lahu 'indi thalathun min al-khayli dhukurun' (He has with me three horses, males), or 'Lahu thalathun min al-khayli inathun' (three horses, females). Likewise women, camels, cows, and the like; its number runs on the feminine because of what I mentioned to you, as they are all females.\n\nIbn Duraid and Al-Yazidi informed us, they said: Abd al-Rahman bin akhi Al-Asma'i informed us from his uncle, he said: The Arabs say 'Darabtu Fulanan hatta ahda'tuhu', i.e., I quieted him. 'Matala Fulanun al-qawla': If he prolonged it one part upon another. 'Tamattala al-jawadu': If he extended one part upon another. It is said: 'Askantu Fulanan wa ahfaztuhu': If I angered him. 'Al-Muqallis': The one who plays before the Emir when he enters the city. 'Al-Sa''at': The one who rents out camels. The Arabs say: 'Inna la-fi sanatin tajada'at afa'iha': If they ate each other due to severe drought. And they say: 'Asabatha sanatun khafiya fiha al-bayadu wa zahara as-sawadu': i.e., milk decreased due to lack of vegetation, and dates (black) appeared, i.e., he has dates and water. He said: It was said to a man from the Kilabis: Did you marry so-and-so? He said: Yes. They said: She does not cover you from nakedness ('Awra) nor cure you from 'Surah'. Meaning 'She does not cover you from nakedness': She is clumsy and does not know how to build a house for you to cover yourself with. 'Nor cure you from Surah': i.e., she does not oil your head nor delouse it.\n\nAl-Akhfash recited to us, by Ibn al-Mu'tazz:\n(Khafif Meter)\nThe full moon promised a visit at night ... So when he fulfilled, I paid my vows.\nI said, O my master, why did you not prefer ... The night over the joy of the fresh day?\nHe said to me: I do not like changing a custom ... Such is the custom in the rising of full moons.\nHe said: So some of them competed with him in this meaning and said:\n(Khafif Meter)\nMy nurse said to me and showed passion ... After avoidance, aversion, and distance.\nHe said I am coming with the evening ... So wait for me and do not fear a breach.\nI said: O my master, then why not by day ... It is the announcement of the joy of union.\nHe said to me: I do not like changing a custom ... Thus the full moon comes in the darkness.\n\nAl-Zajjaj recited to us, he said: Al-Mubarrad recited to us:\n(Basit Meter)\nIf they envy me, then I do not envy them ... Before me, people of virtue among men were envied.\nSo what is with me and what is with them lasted for me and them ... And most of us died of rage at what he finds.\nI am the one whom they find in their throats ... I do not ascend (Artaqi) a form (Suwaran) in them nor do I go down (Aridu).\nHe said: Similar is the saying of Marwan bin Abi Hafsa:\n(Kamil Meter)\nAnd I was gifted a million million, not mixed ... Except with a cause of a Caliph and a Wazir.",

A man came to him, short (Jaydar), small-headed (Sa'l), protruding forehead, ugly-faced (Shatim), as if he were a poker (Mihrath), and with him a woman like a white she-camel (Faqah 'Ansa'), turning two wide eyes (Najlawayn) as if their eyelashes were the primaries of a swallow. She revealed a forearm like the spadix (Ighrid) in whiteness and fingertips like the plants of the sand dune (Nabat an-Naqa). Then she said with the sweetest and most eloquent wording, showing teeth like hail, then said: O Judge, this is my husband (Ba'li). Shurayh said: Is he so? He grinned with two receding lips revealing huge teeth like the spinal vertebrae of a wild ass. Shurayh said to her: What is his matter? She said: O Judge, he is my cousin. I am Khawlah bint Muharramah, one of the women of Jarm. He migrated me from my family and took me away from my relatives, so I became looking only at him, and attacking only him. And he, by Allah, is gluttonous when he eats, sinister when he asks, locked of hands with miserliness, loose of tongue with obscenity. He eats alone, withholds his aid, and breaks his promise. If I treat him gently he frowns, and if I try to please him he gets angry. He preserves his money and humiliates his family. The man shouted: O men, for the slander (Afikah)! Then he knelt on his knees and said: O Judge, rather ask the nobles of Banu Jarm, for they will inform you of the clear news:\n(Basit Meter)\nDo I leave the huge-humped she-camel playing ... When the strong wind plays with the dangerous matter?\nFor the neighbor, the guest, and the poor, they have worked ... In a night where the cold spears spring from the cold.\nAnd I invalidate the opponent possessor of the one-eyed argument ... Until he stammers from stuttering and restriction.\nAnd I leave the peer yellow of fingertips ... Bloody of the collarbones, thrown on the dust.\nAnd ask them, did they throw me towards a calamity ... And I did not fight something with cut fangs?\nAnd ask them how is his defense of their harem ... When the borrowed war throws sparks.\nIndeed I am great in the eye of the brave despite ... What was in me of shortness and thickness (Tajdir).\nUntil he turns away seeking shelter from confronting me ... The turning of fox cubs from the lion, crusher.\nBy Allah, our two persons will not be gathered by harmony ... After this day in Bedouin life or city.\nShurayh said to him: Clarify your intention regarding her. He said: She is divorced thrice, and this young man, Ibn Aban bin Abi Waliha, will undertake her maintenance until the end of her waiting period. Then he rose.\n\n'Al-Jaydar': Short, like 'Al-Buhtar', 'Al-Bahtar', 'Al-Ku'alik', 'Al-Hanbal', 'Ad-Dakdak', 'Ad-Dinamah', and 'Ad-Dina'ah'. 'As-Sa'l': Small-headed. 'Ash-Shatim': Ugly-faced. 'Al-Mihrath': The stick with which fire is stirred, blackened and burnt. 'Al-'Ansa'': The white she-camel. 'Al-'Aynan an-Najlawan': Wide eyes.

'Al-Musanah': Cajoling and softening. From it the poet's saying:\n(Tawil Meter)\nDo not despair and ask Allah for provision (Nawwirah), for He ... If Allah eases the knot of difficult things, it eases.\n'Istanyira': He says: Ask Him for 'An-Nirah' which is provision. Meaning of 'Sanna': Eased.

And 'Fulanun yulawimu Fulanan' with Waw if each blames the other.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Arab al-Husayn bin Duraid informed me from his father from Ibn al-Kalbi from his father from Abu Mikhnaf, he said: Two sheikhs from the people of Al-Sarat told me, they said: Qusayb bin al-Qasim, one of Banu Minhab bin Daws, was one of the men of the Arabs famous for bravery, might, and boldness. He was generous, keeping nothing. He went out once in a march with his companions intending to raid Bajila, but he encountered them prepared, having been warned of him. His wealth was for the poor of his people and others; he raided with them if they were fertile, and provided for them if they were destitute (awraqu). So he turned back intending Khath'am, which has forbidding mountains, reefs, and stagnant water with connected thickets. He lay in ambush in some of them for days, he and his companions eating the insects of the earth until that harmed them. They considered returning to their lands empty-handed. One day they woke up exhausted by hunger. Qusayb said to them: O people, if we stay in this state we will die quietly. Then he looked out for them and lo, near the mountain in the middle of a depression was a herd of camels like dark night filling its sides. He went down to his companions and said: O people, I see near this mountain a depression filled with meat. Will you raid it with the rest of our energy and drive away what we can? If we are repelled so we fight until we embrace (wrestle), it will water us [?]. And if we overcome it and are killed, we are more excused among our clan. They said: We see what you saw. Then they went out from their ambush towards the direction until they overlooked the depression. They drove away the nearest cattle to them, a herd, then urged them on and did not sense anyone until they thought they had escaped with them. They made them kneel and benefited from a slaughter for them. The night effaced the trace and blinded the sight, and they spent the night safe, having filled their hands. When the darkness thinned and the dawn column flew and rose, they did not ask until the road ended with them at a pass. When they started up its path, lo, a figure on a peak of it like an eagle wrapped in a cloak. When they approached him, he leaped and shouted at the camels, so they turned back striking whatever they passed as if spears were in their rears. Then he came shuffling in their tracks. We intercepted him, so he shot a man of us, splitting his heart as if he had been warned yesterday. Then he shot another and made him sit, then shot another joining him to them. A man of us shot him, and the arrow stuck in his arm. Then he came chewing the arrow shaft until he broke it. He shot another of us, piercing his thighs. So we retreated from him, four of us; nothing was dearer to us than leaving him nor more hateful to our eyes than him. Then he went out following the camels which had scattered from him until he gathered them. Then he shouted: Let one of you come to me. My companions refrained, so I stood up, by Allah, reluctant, and came to him. He said: Who are the people? I said: What is your need to ask about this? By Allah, you do not seek blood from us, nor do we hope in you for loss of protection. He said: You must tell me, for I have seen faces of yours I feared for. My companions, when I approached him, followed me out of pity for me. I said: We are a people from Azd. He said: Which of them are you? I said: This is what you do not need, and I am not telling you about it. You have driven away who you saw, and our blood is in your people and is not wasted, so mind your business, O Sheikh. He said: Are you not telling me about your affair? Bear witness then, if you do not tell me your lineage. I said: No, by Al-Lat, there is no way to that. He said: Then inform your people that your blood is in the broad [arrows?] of Ath'ath bin Hadiyah al-Tahafi. And here is this herd, take it as spoil, for I am not informing about you. So take if you wish or leave. We returned to the herd, and lo, it was forty increasing by a few. We drove them and came with saddles, looted and avenged. We covenanted not to tell our affair to anyone of our people. We returned to the tribe and were asked about our companions, so we informed that a Hanafi killed them. Three days after our return, in a night gathering of the tribe, a caller called out saying:\n(Mutaqarib Meter)\nDo you not ask the youths returning ... To the tribe with the foulest spoil.\nWith the most miserable herd acquired ... And bringing the most disturbing news.\nWould that Qusayb and his followers ... The morning they attacked Ath'ath.\nThe earth had swallowed them up ... And they became rotten bones in the Kanakith (plants).\nAnd did not wear the bodice of a menstruating woman ... And dirtier than the bodice of menstruation.\nO men, for a story ... Attached to the smeared weakling.\nWould that you, in the pouring rain before it ... Were a slipped fetus raided in a place of dung.",

It is an auto-antonym. It is said 'Awraqa al-qawmu': If their wealth decreased, and 'Awraqu': If their wealth increased. 'Al-Waraq' with fatha on Waw: Wealth of camels, sheep, etc. Al-Ajjaj said:\n(Rajaz Meter)\nYou I call, so accept my flattery ... Forgive my sins and increase my wealth (Waraqi).\ni.e., my wealth. 'Al-Wriq' with kasra on Waw: Silver, likewise 'Ar-Riqah', plural 'Ar-Riqin'. Their proverb: 'Ar-Riqin gives the stupidity of the stupid'. 'Al-Hadirah': The troop.

Lo, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was standing with the people. I said: This is from the Hums, so why did he leave the Sanctuary?\nAl-Asma'i said: 'Al-Hums': Quraysh and those who followed their religion among Arabs. Named so because they were strict ( تشدد - Tashaddud) in their religion. 'Al-Hamasah': Severity. It is said 'Hamisa al-amru hamasan': If it became severe. From it the brave is called 'Ahmas'. Quraysh used to say: We are the people of Allah so we do not leave His Sanctuary. They did not stand (at Arafat) until Islam came, so Allah revealed (Then depart from where the people depart). So they were ordered to stay with the people and depart with them. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, went out to Arafah and stood with the people. Jubayr did not know this reason at that time, so he denied his standing, peace and blessings be upon him, at Arafah and his opposing the Quraysh school in that.\n\nAl-Sa'igh informed us, he said: Ibn Qutayba informed us, he said: Al-Sijistani told me from Al-Asma'i, he said: Ishaq bin Yahya bin Talha told me, he said: Mina is from the descent of Al-Aqabah to Muhassir. The standing of Muzdalifah is from Muhassir to the markers of the Sanctuary. The standing of Arafah is in the Hill (Al-Hill - non-sanctuary), not in the Sanctuary.\n\nAl-Yazidi informed us, he said: Sulaym bin Abd al-Aziz bin Abi Na'ib from the descendants of Abd al-Rahman bin Awf informed me from his father from Abdullah bin Ja'far raising it to Ibn Abbas from his father Al-Abbas bin Abd al-Muttalib, he said: Abd al-Muttalib went out to Yemen in the winter journey. A man from the people of the Psalms (Zabur) met him and asked his lineage, so he told him. He said: Do you order me to look at something of you? He said: Yes, as long as it is not my private parts. He started turning the septum of his nose and saying: I see magic in which is the light of Prophethood, but we do not find the command to be except in Banu Zuhrah. Do you have a 'Sha'ah'? He said: What is the 'Sha'ah'? He said: A wife. He said: As for today, no. He said: So return and marry in Banu Zuhrah. So he returned and married Halah bint Wuhayb bin Abd Manaf bin Zuhrah, and married his son Abdullah to Amina bint Wahb bin Abd Manaf bin Zuhrah. Quraysh said: Abdullah succeeded over his father Abd al-Muttalib. Halah bore him Hamzah and Al-Muqawwam and Safiyyah children of Abd al-Muttalib, and Amina bore Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, for Abdullah.\n\nIbn Duraid informed us, he said: Abu Hatim informed us from Abu Ubayda, he said: Ibn Da'b said:",

    "text": "People named the perfumes Al-Ghaliyah, Al-Sahiriyah, and Al-Abir after the daughters of Abd from Banu Abdullah bin Sakhr bin Nafi' bin Salaf bin Yaqzan from the people of Yemen from the pure Arabs. He had three daughters called: Al-Ghaliyah, Al-Sahiriyah, and Al-Abir. They gathered and crushed musk, ambergris, and oud. Al-Ghaliyah mixed it with ban oil, so it was said: This is the perfume of Al-Ghaliyah. Al-Sahiriyah mixed it with mercury, so it was said: This is the perfume of Al-Sahiriyah. Al-Abir mixed it with rose water, so it was said: This is the perfume of Al-Abir. This is how this report was narrated to us. As for linguists, they differ. Al-Asma'i claims that Al-Abir is: Saffron, and argues with the saying of Al-Asha:\n(Mutaqarib Meter)\nAnd she cools with the coolness of the bride's cloak ... In the summer, into which you poured Al-Abir.\nOthers besides Al-Asma'i claim that Al-Abir is mixtures gathered with saffron, thus differentiating between Al-Abir and Saffron. 'At-Tumah': A bead made of silver like a pearl.\n\nAl-Yazidi recited to us for his uncle:\n(Sari' Meter)\nI have become impatient with you while seeking reform ... While you turn away from the duty.\nWho is there for me to ensure we do until you see ... How many absent ones you have in the world.\nHe also recited to us for him:\n(Kamil Meter)\nThere was later a friend who quarreled ... With affection, giving his love, not hostile.\nUntil he passed, and his enemy and friend ... Are equal in hate for him and affection.\n\nAl-Zajjaj informed us, he said: Al-Mubarrad informed us, he said: Ibn al-A'rabi used to attack Abu Nuwas and belittle his poetry. He attended a session where there were some narrators of Abu Nuwas. So he recited to him for Abu Nuwas:\n(Kamil Meter)\nThe trace of sleep between the eyelids is altered ...

As for 'Asa', it is used with 'An', and the rest of its sisters are used without 'An', like your saying: 'Asa Zaydun an yaquma' (Perhaps Zayd will stand), and 'Asa Amrun an yarkaba'. The place of 'An' is accusative, and the estimation is: Zayd approached departure. 'An' with the verb is in the interpretation of the source (Masdar), as if you said: 'Asa Zaydun al-qiyama'. If you said: 'Asa Zaydun al-qiyama' it would not be permissible; it is only permissible if you mention 'An', even if the meaning is the meaning of the source. The reason for forbidding that is that if you mentioned 'An' with the verb, you indicated the future, not the meaning (essence), therefore using the source with 'Asa' is not permissible, nor the active participle, except that it came in one proverb of the Arabs, which is their saying:\n(Manhuk Rajaz Meter)\n'Asa al-ghuwayru ab'usa'",

    "text": "This is a proverb struck for a man who brings a matter, attributes it to another, while he is suspected of it. 'Ghuwayr': Diminutive of 'Ghar' (Cave). The first to strike this proverb was Al-Zabba', the Roman woman, when Qasir came to take vengeance for Amr. He had a fortified fortress, so he put men in boxes and came to her fortress. It had a tunnel, so he placed men over it. When she sensed the calamity, she intended to exit from the tunnel but discerned men upon it, so she said: 'Asa al-ghuwayru ab'usa' (Perhaps the little cave is misery), meaning I have been approached from the direction of the cave. Then it became a proverb struck for everyone accused of a matter. In the Hadith: A man was found 'Malfutan' (strangled?), so Umar was brought to him. Umar said to him: \"Asa al-ghuwayru ab'usa\", suspecting him of it. Then an Arif praised him with good, so he said: \"Rabbata dhalika wa la marrah\" (Perhaps that, not even once).\nIf you advance 'An', saying: 'Asa an yaqula Zaydun', the place of 'An' is nominative, estimation: 'Zayd's standing approached'. Allah said: (Perhaps your Lord will raise you). This is the rule of 'Asa'. You say regarding the rest of its sisters: 'Ja'ala Zaydun yaqulu kadha wa kadha' (Zayd started saying such and such). And 'Kada Zaydun yakhruju' (Zayd almost went out). You do not say: 'Ja'ala Zaydun an yaqula', nor 'Kada an yakhruja' except in poetic necessity. Among Arab proverbs: 'Kada an-na'amu yatiru' (Ostriches almost fly), and 'Kada al-'arusu yakunu amiran' (The bridegroom almost becomes a prince), due to their nearness to that state. Allah Almighty said: (The flash of its lightning almost takes away the eyesight). The reason for using 'Asa' with 'An' and its sisters without 'An' is that 'Kada' and 'Akhadha' and similar verbs are made for the comparison of the action and overseeing its occurrence and existence. Do you not see that you do not say: 'Kidtu adkhulu al-madinata' (I almost entered the city) except when you are overlooking it, and you do not say: 'Ja'ala Zaydun yaqulu kadha wa kadha' except to narrate his state in saying. So this does not need 'An' because it falls upon the state. As for 'Asa', it is as I mentioned to you, seeking the verb as future and awaited, so it is for the approach of its name not its essence. Do you not see that you say: 'Asa an ahujja' (Perhaps I will perform Hajj), while you have not left your place yet. This is clear and evident. Then 'Asa' may come in poetry out of necessity without 'An', and 'Kada' and its sisters with 'An'. Hudba bin al-Khashram said regarding 'Asa' without 'An':\n(Wafir Meter)\nPerhaps the distress I have ended up in ... Behind it will be a near relief.\nRu'ba said regarding 'Kada':\n(Rajaz Meter)\nIt almost, from the length of decay, became effaced (an yamsaha).\nThe original is what I mentioned to you.\n\nIssue on Nouns: Why are they not Jussive? And Verbs: Why are they not Genitive?\nIf a questioner asks and says: Why are nouns not jussive (Majzum)? There are answers to that. Among them is what Sibawayh relied on and those who followed him after. He said: Nouns are not jussive due to their empowerment (tamakkun) and the attachment of Tanwin (nunation) to them, so they would not combine the loss of it (Tanwin) and the loss of the vowel (Harakah) upon them. The summary of that: Basrans and Kufans have agreed that Tanwin is necessary for nouns, not verbs and particles. If a noun like 'Ja'far' were jussive, silencing the Ra would be necessary for Jazm, and after it is Tanwin based on the principle agreed upon between them. So two sakin (still) letters would meet, which are the Tanwin and the Ra. It would be necessary to move one of them or delete it. According to the conventions of Arab speech, if two sakins meet and the first is a sound letter, not a letter of Madd (extension) or Lin (softness), the first must be moved (voweled), as you say: 'Idrib Zaydan', then you say: 'Idribi al-ghulam', moving the Ba due to the meeting of two sakins. If the first of them is a letter of Madd and Lin, which are Ya, Waw, and Alif, the first is deleted, as you say: 'Zaydun yaghzu al-qawma', 'Amrun yaqdi al-yawma', and 'Zaydun yakhsha an-nasa', as Allah Almighty said (And you fear the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him), and His saying (Those who believed and did righteous deeds). These letters drop from pronunciation even if they are fixed in writing, except if two sound sakins meet in the assimilated (Mudgham), then you move the second of them, like your saying in the imperative: 'Mudda' and 'Shudda', because there is no way to move the first, for if the first moved and the second was still, the doubling (Tad'if) would appear, like saying: 'Madadta' and 'Shadadtahu' and similar. So if you moved the Ra of 'Ja'far' based on this analogy, Jazm would be nullified from speech, because whenever you made a noun jussive you would be correct to silence its end then move it due to the meeting of two sakins. If you deleted the Ra due to the meeting of two sakins, the noun would be nullified because its meaning is completed by its entirety. If you deleted the Tanwin due to the meeting of two sakins, you would have deleted the vowel, returning to Sibawayh's saying of deleting a vowel and Tanwin, and you would be unjust to the noun by the loss of two things. Moreover, among nouns are those whose penultimate is sakin like 'Bakr' and 'Zayd'. If such a noun were jussive on this estimation he mentioned, three sakin letters would meet in it, and the meeting of such is impossible. This is Sibawayh's school, and it has become clear from it that the entry of Jazm on nouns is not permissible in wording.",

    "text": "Al-Farra and his companions said: Nouns are not made jussive (majzum) because they are light, so if they were made jussive, it would add to their lightness. And verbs are not made genitive (makhfud) due to their heaviness, so if they were made genitive, it would add to their heaviness. Thus, they balanced the speech by making nouns genitive and verbs jussive, so that the heavy enters upon the light and the lightness upon the heavy, resulting in equilibrium. A group of the Basrans and a group of the people of speculation (theorists), including Al-Mubarrad and Tha'lab, said: Nouns are not made jussive due to the impossibility of a jussive particle entering upon them, because the jussive particles are only for negation, command, prohibition, and conditional reward, and whatever does not revert in meaning to one of these meanings, such as 'lam' (did not), the 'lam' of command, the 'la' of prohibition, and the conditional particles 'in' (if), 'mahuma' (whatever), and the like. It is impossible to negate nouns because minds necessarily indicate that negation does not apply to the name nor the named object; rather, it applies to a state among its states, an action among its actions, or an attribute among its attributes. Like your saying: 'Zayd is not rational' (Laysa Zaydun 'aqilan), you only negated his rationality. And 'Zayd is not in the house', you only negated his being in the house. Likewise: 'Zayd did not stand' (Lam yaqum Zayd), and 'Abdullah did not speak', and 'You have no servant' (La ghulama laka), and the like. Negation does not attach to the named object itself, but rather attaches to its actions, news, and states. This is agreed upon by the theorists, and minds testify to its correctness. Similarly, command, prohibition, conditional reward, and the like only occur with verbs. He said: If a claimer claims that negation connects to nouns in their essence, without meaning by that the non-existence of the essence from a time or place it exists in, let him provide evidence for the validity of that which minds testify to be correct, and he will never find a way to do so. There is no disagreement among scholars regarding what we mentioned about negation. It suffices as proof of the error and 'inqita' (being silenced/defeated) of the one opposing this that he has departed from what the collective testifies to be correct. Know that the 'inqita' (defeat/silencing) of an opponent is not only by his silence and interruption. Scholars have categorized 'inqita' into compilations and clarified its aspects. One of them is that a person holds a doctrine in jurisprudence, grammar, theory, or other sciences, then meets an opponent who holds a contrary doctrine, with the difference established between them. They debate an issue, and one of them continues to press the other with arguments until he forces his companion to believe what contradicts the doctrine he supports. If he believes that, he is 'munqati' (defeated) by exiting his doctrine which he started observing and was stubborn about shifting from. If he does not adopt what he was forced into and brings something to repel his opponent with a clear argument, he has come close. But if he cannot do that and acknowledges the truth, he is 'munqati' (defeated) while being fair and following the path of observation/theory, and he is more excused than the first stubborn one. The second type of 'inqita' is when the cause (illah) does not consistently apply to the effect. The third type is that the matter leads the debater to believe in the impossible and say it is the truth if, in his claim, it supports his doctrine; and a doctrine supported by impossibility is sufficient evidence of corruption. It is as if he believes that a single body can be moving and stationary in one state, or not stationary and moving, or existent and non-existent in one state. Or that a human is standing and sitting in one state, or speaking and silent, or moving and stationary. Or he says fire is cooling and water is heating. Or he claims that yesterday has not passed yet and tomorrow is present or has passed. And similar attempts. Similar in impossibility is the saying of one who claims that if we say: 'Zayd did not stand' (Lam yaqum Zayd), or 'Lam Zayd qama'—if that were proper—that the negation applies to the essence of Zayd, not his action. There is no difference between this and the first regarding impossibility for anyone of sound mind and discernment. Whoever's matter leads to this has been cut off (defeated) and his limbs cut, and speech will not benefit him as his failure and defeat have become clear, and it is not within his opponent's power to force him to silence, and there is nothing more upon him than what he has clarified. Another type of 'inqita' is when something is presented to the opponent which he does not know the direction of, so he acknowledges the truth and says: 'I do not have an answer at this time, and I will consider it.' This is the way of scholars, and this acknowledger of what was presented to him does not decrease from the rank of knowledge by this characteristic; rather, he increases in majesty among scholars by this characteristic. Al-Zajjaj informed us, saying: I heard Al-Mubarrad say: It was narrated from Al-Sha'bi that it was said to him: 'Aren't you ashamed of how often you say \"I don't know\" when asked?' He said: 'But the angels of Allah, the drawn-near ones, were not ashamed when they were asked about what they had no knowledge of, for they said: \"Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us.\"' Ahmad ibn al-Hasan ibn Sufyan informed us, saying Ahmad ibn Ubayd ibn Nasih informed us, saying: 'Umarah ibn 'Aqil ibn Bilal ibn Jarir visited Ja'far and Muhammad, the two sons of Sulayman ibn Ali ibn Abdullah ibn Abbas. They interceded for him with Al-Mahdi until they brought him in to him. He ordered wealth and slaves for him, so he ('Umarah) said: [Poem in Tawil meter] May Allah water ruins and a blessing... to Malhaz when the tribe dwells in Muhallaz. A herd from Buhtan drove them... and another from the north when it moved...",

    "text": "I knew in it a white woman from the family of Mazin... whenever she traces her lineage, she counts Hilal ibn Ajwaz. The riding camels departed, ascending towards you... with fat camels until they began to be thought of as emaciated from travel. How many a rugged hill I crossed towards you, and sand... and dark dusty storms and stony ground. Young female hares aiming at ostriches by the nose-rings... when the fifth day (of thirst) in the desert clings to the riders. [Repeat of verse] Young female hares aiming at ostriches by the nose-rings... when the fifth day in the desert clings to the riders. They did not reach until their eyes seemed... like small wells in stones that had become depleted. May Allah reward Ja'far and Muhammad on my behalf... with Allah's honor, and the best of rewards. For they facilitated my entry to the Caliph... and they bestowed upon me abundantly, so he fulfilled. Their palms are moist (generous) and their merit is known... when the palms of people become depleted. How many a weary one hoped for their goal... so he fell short, blamed and tired, while they surpassed. Their two spears, the possessor of hatred found no... softness in them, nor did enemies find a weak spot in war. They are the two sons of the Messenger of Allah and the two sons of his cousin... Sulayman, the best of people in branch and root. And indeed, you two, O sons of Sulayman, are my equipment... and my sanctuary when I find no sanctuary. And indeed, you are the most fulfilling of Nizar in pact... and the most noble ascent for a visitor when he is in need. Ibn 'Umarah said: So I recited these verses to my father, and he said: 'Your father heaped praise upon them, so did they give us a servant to serve him?' I said: 'They gave us a servant and much wealth.' Ibn Shuqayr informed us, saying Ahmad ibn Ubayd informed us from Ya'qub ibn al-Sikit, saying: There was a man among the Arabs who was bad at demanding payment, and another who was bad at paying debts, called 'Aqrab (Scorpion). The Arabs said: We wish a transaction would occur between them so we can see what they do. So a transaction occurred between them for a set term. When it was a month before the term, the demander came to 'Aqrab's door, built a bench opposite it, and sat on it. 'Aqrab came out and said: 'What brought you?' He said: 'Good.' He said: 'Has your debt come due?' He said: 'Have I demanded payment from you?' He said: 'Then why are you sitting at my door?' He said: 'Do you prevent me from the road?' So he remained staying on the bench for thirty days and nights until the term fell due. 'Aqrab came out to him and struck his hand into his (paid him), and he did not leave him until he paid his debt. He recited saying: [Poem in Sari' meter] A scorpion ('Aqrab) traded in our market... No welcome to the wicked scorpion. Every enemy fears his evil... and his stinging tail is feared. Indeed an enemy whose plot is in his rear... is not possessor of evil nor a provider. If the scorpion returns, we return for it... and the sandal/shoe was present for it. Issue: The saying of Allah Almighty: (Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - for them is forgiveness and a great reward) [Quran 48:29], so it is in the nominative case (raf'). And He said at the end of Surah Al-Fath regarding the companions of Muhammad (PBUH): (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him...) until He ended at His saying: (Allah has promised those who have believed and done righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward) [Quran 48:29], so it is in the accusative case (nasb) by the action falling upon it. The estimation is: Allah promised those who believed among them forgiveness, meaning covering of their previous sins before Islam, and overlooking them, and a great reward for their supporting the Prophet (PBUH) and their assisting him, a virtue for them over others of the believers who did not assist him. As for the first verse, He said: (Allah has promised those who believed...), so it came generally, then He explained that promise and said: (for them is forgiveness and a great reward). So the estimation is: Allah promised them a promise, then He clarified the promise and said: 'for them is forgiveness'. If it were in the accusative case while the 'Lam' (for) was present, it would not be permissible and the speech would be invalid, and it would be like saying: 'I promised Zayd for him a dirham'. But He implied the promised object as a verbal noun (masdar), because implication (idmar) in the speech of the Arabs and in the Book of Allah is famous and frequent due to the indication of the speech upon it. From it is His saying: (Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs to imprison him for a time) [Quran 12:35]. The estimation is: 'It appeared to them an appearance (badw)', because the verb must have a subject. And from it: (After the hearts of a party of them had almost deviated) [Quran 9:117], so in 'kada' (almost) there is an implied subject, otherwise it would not be a verb. And from it is the saying of the Arabs: 'Whoever lies, it was evil for him, and whoever speaks truth, it was good for him', so they implied 'truth' and 'lying' due to the indication of the verb upon them. And from it is his saying: 'Whoever resembles his father has not wronged the resemblance', meaning he did not put it in [other than] its place. And from it: (And let not those who greedily withhold...) then He said: (it is bad for them) [Quran 3:180]. Its interpretation: The stinginess is bad for them. He said Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik told us, saying Yazid ibn Harun told us, saying Muhammad ibn al-Rabi' ibn al-Hakam told me:",

    "text": "Niftawayh informed us, saying Yazid ibn Harun told us from Salim ibn Sa'id ibn Mina, saying: I heard Ibn al-Zubayr while on the pulpit when he wanted to demolish the Kaaba and rebuild it, saying: My aunt Aisha told me that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: 'O Aisha, were it not that your people are close in time to polytheism (recently converted), I would have demolished the Kaaba and then added six cubits to it from the Hijr. Indeed, Quraysh fell short in funds when they built it, and I would have made for it two doors: an eastern door and a western door.' He said: So I witnessed him when he demolished it and added six cubits to it from the Hatim (Hijr), and there were rocks like the rumps of camels, and he made two doors for it and rejoiced greatly at that. Niftawayh said: When Ibn al-Zubayr was killed in the year seventy-three, Abd al-Malik appointed Al-Hajjaj over the Hijaz, so he demolished what Ibn al-Zubayr had built and returned it to its first state, and it remains so until now. Regarding this, Jarir says: [Poem in Tawil meter] I see the birds with Al-Hajjaj running our days... for you, O Commander of the Faithful, and helping. You returned to the House of Allah the covenant of His Prophet... and you repaired what the two concealers (Al-Khabiyan) had corrupted. He said: Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr was nicknamed Abu Bakr and his brother was nicknamed Abu Khubayb, so he was nicknamed by his brother, thus it was said: The two Khubaybs (Al-Khabiyan). Niftawayh informed us, saying Tha'lab informed me from Ibn al-A'rabi, saying: The Arabs say: Make this matter one 'Ba'j' (method/way), one 'Simat', one 'Bayan', one 'Sikkah', 'Unbub', 'Razdaq', 'Shawkal', 'Qiddah', 'Shirak', 'Ru'bub', 'Hanan', 'Waddah', and 'Mahajjah'. All with one meaning. This is the narration from Ibn al-A'rabi. He said: This is expansion and approximation. 'Al-Ba'j': The one horn, and it is Arabized Persian. As for 'Sikkah', 'Hanan', 'Waddah', and 'Mahajjah', they mean the road/path. As for 'Satr', 'Razdaq', and 'Simat', they mean the row of people and others. As for 'Qiddah' and 'Shirak', they mean the strip/way. Al-Akhfash recited to us, saying Tha'lab recited to me, and I read to Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Ahwal, by Ta'abbata Sharran: [Poem in Tawil meter] And they said to her: Do not marry him, for he is... at the first peer meeting, to encounter a death. He says: He will be killed in the first war he meets because he exposes himself to death. So she did not see one who saw a 'Fatil' (tiny thread/worthless thing) and she was cautious... so her widowhood is from one wearing the night, most terrifying. He says: She did not see one who saw prudence worth a 'Fatil' in her leaving marriage. 'Fatil': The thread in the slit of a date stone. Little of the 'Ghirar' (sleep) of the eye, his greatest concern... is the blood of vengeance or meeting a bold brave warrior. 'Ghirar': Little sleep. 'Ghirar' in other contexts: The edge of a sword and the like. And 'Ghirar': The pattern/example; it is said: Their houses are on one 'Ghirar', i.e., on one pattern. And 'Ghirar': Slump of the market; it is said: Our market has a 'Dirrah' (flow) and 'Ghirar' (slump), i.e., exhaustion and slump. 'Al-Kami': The brave one, named so because he covers ('yatakamma') himself in fighting and evil, i.e., intends them; or it is said he is named so because he covers his bravery, i.e., hides it. 'Al-Mushayya'': Also the brave one. He fights (yumasiu) every one who encourages his day... and his striking the skulls of enemies is not to be encouraged (called brave). 'Mumas'ah': Deception/skill with swords, and likewise 'Sa'a'. And his saying 'yushajji'u yawmahu' (encourages his day) which he meets. 'Ma' is extra/redundant. The meaning: His striking the skulls of enemies is to be described with bravery. Tha'lab said: It is better that 'ma' is negation (Jahd), and the meaning is that his creation is the creation of the brave. So his bravery is nature, and his striking of the enemy's skulls is not to be described with bravery but is nature. Little saving of meat except for a sustenance... for the rib cartilage has expanded and the intestines stuck. He says: He does not eat meat except the amount to sustain himself. 'Nashara al-Sharsuf' means: The volume of his rib cartilages appeared due to the meeting of the 'Aqlab' (belly/intestines?) and the skin. 'Al-Sharsuf': Cartilage attached to every rib like the cartilage of the shoulder. He spends the night as the meaning of wild beasts until they become familiar with him... so he became such that he does not protect a pasture from them forever. But the owners of pregnant camels, it grieves them... when they see him bareheaded or masked. He says: That the owners of camels grieve because of him and fear him because he chases them in every state, bareheaded or armed. 'Al-Makhad': Pregnant camels, singular is 'Khalifah' from a different wording. And I, even if I live long, know that I... will meet the spearhead of death shining, bald (exposed). Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Abdullah ibn Muslim ibn Qutaybah informed us, saying my father told me, and Abu al-Qasim al-Sa'igh informed us, saying Ibn Qutaybah told us, saying Al-Sijistani informed me from Abu Ubaydah regarding His Almighty's saying: (And extended shade) [Quran 56:30], he said: Permanent, not removed by the sun. Abu Muhammad said: And in the tradition (The shade of Paradise is 'Sajih'), he said its meaning is there is no heat in it nor cold. Some scholars said it is like the mornings of summer before the sun rises. The meaning of the shade of Paradise is only... and from it is people's saying: So-and-so is in the shade of So-and-so, i.e., in his shelter and protection. The shade of the night is its blackness because it settles and covers everything with its darkness. Dhul-Rummah said: [Poem in Basit meter]",

    "text": "The distant unknown [desert] has forced the traveler off the road... in a green [dark] shade where the owls call its skulls. Meaning: in a black shade. Ahmad and Abu al-Qasim al-Sa'igh informed us. He said: Abdullah ibn Muslim told us from Al-Sijistani from Abu Ubaydah regarding the saying of Allah Almighty (A place of settlement and a place of storage) [Quran 6:98]. He said: Settlement in the loins, and storage in the womb. Al-Akhfash and Al-Zajjaj informed us from Al-Mubarrad who said: Three poets whose poetry became professional (as a trade), all from Himyar: Al-Musannad, Yahya ibn Nawfal, and Abu al-Hawl. Al-Fadl ibn Yahya al-Barmaki sat at Al-Nahrawan in a session exclusive for poetry. Abu al-Hawl advanced to recite to him. He said: 'I will not hear any praise from you until you recite to me what you satirized us with.' He refused, but he swore upon him that he must do it. So he recited saying: [Poem in Mutaqarib meter] If polytheism is mentioned in a gathering... the faces of Banu Barmak light up. And if a Surah is recited among them... they bring tales from Mazdak. So he ordered twenty thousand dirhams for him, and said: 'Bring the praise.' So he recited saying: [Poem in Tawil meter] To my knowledge of this sea, none crosses it... except one fearful of his sin or a risk-taker. So your generosity became populated... as if upon it were firm bridges. So he ordered twenty thousand dirhams for him. When he received the money, he said to him: 'May Allah amend you, this money will not arrive safely with me to my home.' So he sent horsemen with him until they brought him close to his home. Al-Zajjaj recited to us, saying Al-Mubarrad recited to us, saying Al-Mazini recited to me by Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali: [Poem in Wafir meter] I love Muhammad a strong love... and Abbas and Hamza and the Trustee (Ali). I love them for the love of Allah until... I come when resurrected upon my passion. A passion I was given since the mill of Islam... rotated, not equating [them] equally [with others]. The vile ones, Banu Qushayr, say... throughout time: 'You do not forget Ali.' The cousins of the Prophet and his closest kin... are the most beloved of all people to me. So if loving them is guidance, I have attained it... and I am not mistaken if it is error. Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti told us, saying my father told us, saying Al-Salt ibn Mas'ud al-Jahdari told us, saying Haytham ibn Adi al-Ta'i Abu Abd al-Rahman told us from Mujalid ibn Sa'id from Al-Sha'bi who said: We asked Ibn Abbas or Ibn Abbas was asked: Who was the first of people to embrace Islam? He said: Abu Bakr. Have you not heard the saying of Hassan: [Poem in Basit meter] If you remember a sorrow from a trustworthy brother... then remember your brother Abu Bakr for what he did. The best of creation, the most pious and most just... after the Prophet and the most fulfilling of what he bore. The follower, the second, whose scene is praised... and the first of people among them to believe the messengers. Niftawayh informed us from Tha'lab from Salamah from Al-Farra who said: Everything round is 'Kuffah', and everything elongated is 'Kiffah'. And 'Kaffah': The single instance of 'Kaff' (refraining/hem) with Fatha, and according to Al-Kisa'i 'Kaffah' of the scale (pan) is with Fatha as well. And 'Kiffah' with Kasra: Whatever is round of sand. And 'Kiffah' also: The ring of the sieve. And 'Kiffah' also: The trap of the hunter, and it is called 'Al-Bayda' (The White). He recited: [Poem in Tawil meter] And a 'Bayda' (trap) from the wealth of the youth, if he removes it... he gains, otherwise his wealth is the wealth of a destitute. He says: If he removes it (the trap/calamity), he has gained some wealth, otherwise he is destitute. And 'Al-Bayda': The sun. He recited: [Poem in Tawil meter] And a 'Bayda' (sun/woman) not stamped with a defect seen in her... the eyes of youths look below her squinting. And 'Al-Bayda': The ostrich egg. He recited: [Poem in Tawil meter] And a 'Bayda' (egg) which does not move away from us, and its mother... when she sees us, her strutting ceases. Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Al-Mubarrad informed us, saying Isa ibn Yazid ibn Bakr ibn Da'b said: When Mu'awiyah became seriously ill, he sent for Yazid, who was at his estates, with a servant of his named [Name missing/unclear] to inform him of his father's heaviness. When he informed him, he came rushing and recited saying: [Poem in Basit meter] The messenger came with a paper dragging it... so the heart sensed fear from his paper. We said: Woe to you, what is in your scroll?... He said: The Caliph has become in pain among us. So the earth shook or almost shook with us... as if a dusty [mountain] from its corners was uprooted. I ascended upon it [the news/journey] to bridled white camels... covering the mountain passes with them, not coming to a water-way. We do not care, if they destroy our saddles... what died of them in the desert or limped. He whose soul ceases not to overlook a height... the destinies of that soul are about to fall. When we arrived and the door of the house was closed... for fear of widowhood, the heart was frightened and deterred.",

    "text": "When he entered upon him, he was alone with him and sent his family out. He said: 'O Yazid, the command of Allah has come, and this is the time of my perishing. So what will you do with the affair of this nation after me? For your sake, I preferred the world over the Hereafter and carried the burden on my back so that you may rise above the sons of your father.' He said: 'I will take them by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet, and I will fight them upon it.' He said: 'Woe to you! Will you not proceed with the conduct of Abu Bakr who fought the people of apostasy and passed while the Ummah was pleased with him?' He said: 'No, except I take them by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet and fight them upon it.' He said: 'Will you not proceed with the conduct of Umar who mobilized the armies, established the garrison cities, prescribed the stipend, protected the spoils, fought the enemy, and passed while the Ummah was pleased with him?' He said: 'No, except I take them by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet and fight them upon it.' He said: 'Will you not proceed with the conduct of your uncle Uthman who ate during his life and fed after his death, and employed his relatives?' He said: 'No, except I take them by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet and fight them upon it.' He said: 'Will you not proceed with the conduct of your father who ate during his life and fed after his death and carried the burden on his back?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'O Yazid, hope is cut off from you regarding that you will fight all of these, so you will kill the best of your people, and invade the sanctuary of your Lord with the riffraff of people and feed them their day unjustly without right, then death will surprise you, so neither world did you attain nor Hereafter did you realize. O Yazid, since you will not hit the right path, indeed I have paved the matters for you and humbled the mightiest of Arabs for you, and submitted the people of honor and generosity to you, and sufficed you the settling and traveling, and gathered for you what no one has gathered. I do not fear that anyone will dispute this matter with you except three persons: Al-Husayn ibn Ali, Abdullah ibn Umar, and Ibn al-Zubayr. As for Ibn Umar, he has become weary, occupied with worship, emptied of the world and busied himself, so he will not dispute you over it unless it comes to him effortlessly. As for the one who crouches the crouching of the lion and dodges the dodging of the fox, if an opportunity enables him he leaps upon it, that is Ibn al-Zubayr. If he does and you gain power over him, then cut him piece by piece, unless he seeks peace; if he seeks it, then accept, and spare the blood of your people, their hearts will incline to you. As for Al-Husayn ibn Ali, indeed he has sanctity, a right, and kinship from the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). I do not think the people of Iraq will leave him alone until they bring him out against you. If he does and you gain power over him, then pardon him, for if I were his companion I would have forgiven him. Rise from me.' Al-Akhfash recited to us, saying Al-Mubarrad recited to us by Muslim ibn al-Walid: [Poem in Basit meter] There did not remain after the settling of gray hair in the head... except the anticipation of a disease that has no healer. When I resolved on forgetfulness and my soul... was deterred, and I brought close after ignorance my horses. There passed, presenting to me, the reddish-white wine shining... from the hand of a cupbearer with his eyes and with the cup. She revealed herself, withdrawing from the other, and her saliva... mixes the coolness of satisfaction in the heat of my breaths. Ibn Shuqayr informed us, saying Tha'lab told us from Ibn al-A'rabi, saying: The Arabs say for anyone who cheats: 'He struck fifths for sixths' (Daraba akhmasan li-asdas). The origin of that is that a man had sons tending wealth (camels) for him, and they had wives. They used to say to their father: 'We will tend for a sixth (watering every six days)', so they would tend for five and steal a day to come to their wives. Likewise, they would say 'in the fifth, in the fifth', so they would tend for a fourth and steal a day. So he realized it and said: [Poem in Wafir meter] And that is striking fifths intended for sixths... perhaps they will not be. Al-Kumayt transferred this verse into his poem because it became a common proverb, so he said: And that is striking fifths... [the verse]. Ibn al-A'rabi recited similar to it: [Poem in Basit meter] By Allah, by Allah, were it not that I fear... the Emir, I would have blamed Ibn Nibras. regarding a promise he told me then broke... 'Tomorrow, tomorrow', striking fifths for sixths. Until when we forced his promises... to the truths with gentleness and sociability. His cloud revealed a 'No', so I said to him... 'If only you had started with it, there would be no harm.' And a free man of the people does not return to 'No' after there has passed... from him a 'Yes' obediently. As for the saying of the other: 'And glory is attained in fifths and sixths', its meaning is: It is scattered, hardly found gathered in one. Ibn al-A'rabi said: And 'Al-Nibras': The lamp. It is said: It is 'Al-Nibras', 'Al-Siraj', 'Al-Qirat', 'Al-Qurt', 'Huzluq', 'Al-Misbah', 'Al-Wabisah', 'Al-Wabis', 'Al-Wabis', 'Al-Ma'nus', and 'Al-Haykah', all with one meaning. Al-Akhfash recited to us, saying Al-Mubarrad recited to us by Abu al-Ghanahiyah: [Poem in Madid meter] A dweller remaining, he has a dwelling... Not with this does time inform. We are in a house, informing about it... regarding its trial is a speaker, eloquent. A house of evil, joy does not last... neither the enjoyable in it nor the sadness. In the path of Allah are our souls... all of them are pledged to death.",

    "text": "Every soul at its death... its share of its gathering is a shroud. Abu Bakr Yusuf ibn Ya'qub ibn Ishaq ibn al-Bahlul told us, saying Al-Zubayr ibn Bakkar told us, saying Abu Ghaziyyah told us, saying Ibn Abi Dhi'b told us from Al-Zuhri from Urwah from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: 'Indeed, the servant, when he falls ill, Allah removes sins from him in his illness just as the bellows (al-kir) removes the dross of iron.' Ibn al-Sikit said: 'Al-Kir' is the bellows of the blacksmith. And 'Al-Kur': The camel saddle, and its plural is 'Akwar' and 'Kiran'. He said: And I heard Abu Amr al-Shaybani say: 'Al-Kur' is built of iron and clay, and 'Al-Kir' is the skin bag that is blown into. Bishr said describing his horse: [Poem in Wafir meter] As if the rustling of his nostril whenever... they suppressed the heavy breathing was a round bellows. Yusuf ibn Ya'qub told us, saying my grandfather told me reading to him, saying Ishaq al-Azraq told me from Sufyan and Hamza al-Zayyat from Al-A'sha from Abu Wa'il who said: I heard Abdullah ibn Mas'ud saying: 'Indeed, I have heard the reciters and found them close to each other, so read as you were taught. And beware of excessiveness (tanattu'), for it is only like the saying of one of you: \"Halumma\" (Come), \"Ta'ala\" (Come), and \"Aqbil\" (Come).' Ya'qub told us, saying my grandfather told me reading to him, from Abu Dawood from Muhammad ibn Abdullah from Abu Ishaq from Al-Bara' raising it to the Prophet (PBUH) who said: 'Indeed, some poetry is wisdom and some speech is magic.' Abu al-Qasim said: Thus we narrated this report, and I consulted the Sheikh about it, so he said to them: It is 'Inna min al-shi'ri hukman' (Indeed, from poetry is a judgment/wisdom) with Damma and Sukun on the Kaf. Its interpretation in my view, if narrated this way: That from poetry is what binds the one spoken of like the binding of a legal judgment on the judged, hitting the meaning and aiming for correctness. Regarding something like this, Abu Tammam says: [Poem in Tawil meter] Were it not for a path established by poetry, seekers of high status would not know... from where noble deeds are approached. You see wisdom in what is in it while it is amusement... and it judges for what it judges while it is unjust. Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Al-Mubarrad informed us, saying: I read it to Khalaf, so he told me that he heard it from Abu Amr al-Shaybani and others, that Abdullah ibn Mas'ud al-Fazari and Amr ibn Hubayrah al-Sakuni discussed poetry in the presence of Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan. Al-Sakuni said: Imru' al-Qays is the most poetic of people. Al-Fazari said: Nay, indeed among us are poets whom I do not think anyone reaches, until the argument between them reached a point where they said: 'You decide between us, O Commander of the Faithful.' So he said to Al-Sakuni: 'Recite to me from them.' But he found no narration with him. So Al-Qazari (Al-Fazari) said: 'I will recite to you from them. His cousin says: [Poem in Tawil meter] So I became bidding farewell to youth, except that I... observe four traits from people. Among them is my visitor, the young woman, dew has wetted her... watching a nursing infant adorned with amulets. My suspicion is hard on her and her crying grieves her... so she bends the neck lest it smells (or spreads). And his cousin who says: [Poem in Tawil meter] And a nursing mother or weaner I visited at night... so I distracted her from an infant with amulets, crying. When he cried in his cradle, she turned to him... with a half, while under me her half did not turn. And Mu'awiyah says: 'Uff to him.' He said: And my cousin who says: [Poem in Basit meter] And I do not oppose my neighbor regarding his wife... nor my cousin if he is assassinated (taken unawares). And I do not sharpen my fingernails to slap him... Indeed insulting and bad speech are borne. And I do not say, while the water has an excess breath... from heat, that the water is occupied. And I am not a tie for the provision, withholding it... while I have known that provision is to be eaten. Until it is said, while I have been elevated in a litter... that Ibn Awf Abu Quran is made (generous/noble).' Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Al-Mubarrad informed us, saying: I read it to Khalaf, so he told me that he heard it narrated from Al-Zuhri that he said: I used to go to Ubayd Allah ibn Abdullah to write from him. I would stand for him when he came out and arrange his clothes on him when he rode, until I thought I had exhausted what he had. He came out one day and I did not stand for him. He said to me: 'You are in the rough ground (Al-'Azaz), so stand.' Abu al-Qasim: 'Al-'Azaz': What is hard of the earth, and it is only at the edges of lands and beginnings of roads, but if you are in the middle, you come to softness and ease. So he says to him: 'You are still in the beginnings of sciences and have not reached their middle, so return to what you were on of organization and honoring me.' Al-Akhfash informed us from Al-Mubarrad, saying some of Al-Fakhdhami's companions told me from him that he said: There was a Bedouin woman who had four sons. Four brothers, peers of her sons in age, used to pass by her, and she would find comfort in them. Then her sons were afflicted (died). The brothers stopped visiting her to spare her from sadness when she saw them. Then they resolved a resolve to pass by her out of joy and maintaining ties. When she saw them, she began to say: [Poem in Kamil meter]",

    "text": "The peers will not delay to separate... night and day cycle upon them. Then one of them fell ill and died, so the three cut her off for a time, then they passed by her. She began to say: [Poem in Sari' meter] All sons of a mother, even if numerous... one day they will become one. Then one of them fell ill and died, so the two cut her off for a time, then they passed by her. She said: [Poem in Wafir meter] And every brother, his brother departs from him... by your father's life, except the two Farqads (stars). Then one of them fell ill and died, then the remaining one passed by her. She began to say: [Poem in Sari' meter] And the single individual is like the one who has passed... neither left behind nor immortal. He said to her: 'Accept me, may I be your ransom, for by Allah I am not returning.' Abu al-Qasim said: As for his saying 'Al-Farqadan' (The two Farqads), he raised it (nominative) because he made 'illa' (except) serve as 'kull' (all) and carried it on the meaning of 'ghayr' (other than). As if he said: And every brother *other than* the two Farqads, his brother departs from him. And 'illa' can be an adjective for indefinite nouns because it resembles 'ghayr', like your saying: 'Law kana ma'ana rajulun illa Zaydun lahalakna' (If there were a man with us except Zayd, we would have perished), or as Allah Almighty said: (If there were in them gods except Allah, they would have been corrupted) [Quran 21:22]. Sibawayh said: This is an adjective, and the meaning is: If there were in them gods *other than* Allah, they would have been corrupted. And he recited: [Poem in Basit meter] If there were *other than* me for Sulayma today, *other than* him... the falling of accidents except the sharp sword. Al-Akhfash recited to us, saying Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Ahwal recited to us by Bishr ibn Hudhayl al-Fazari: [Poem in Tawil meter] And a blamer woman woke up at night blaming me... and a blamer did not miss me before that. She says: 'Go slow, let not people see you destitute... and it disgraces who you support, O son of the nobles.' So I said: 'A noble soul refused upon me... and a night visitor says other than that.' He traveled in the darkness of the night, his garment struck by... a 'Dhara'iyyah' (wind/rain) driving the frost in a wet wind. And it was said: 'So-and-so or So-and-so', and a north wind blew with a cold cloudless sky in a wet wind. For I am not ashamed if it is said 'destitute... generous', and it is more fitting that it be said 'miser'. So if my reach is not long, then I... am a reacher for it with righteous traits. If I am among the tall people, I surpass them... with a favor until it is said 'tall'. And how many have we seen of many branches... dying if roots do not give them life. And if matters turn moderate among men, then I... when a matter settles in my courtyard, am great. And do not look at what pleases the eye, but look... at the element of lineages, where it ends up. And there is no good in the beauty of bodies and their height... if minds do not weigh the beauty of bodies. Abu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Mumliq': The poor. Its derivation is from 'Al-Malaqah', which is the smooth rock to which nothing clings. Its plural is 'Malaqat'. Ibn al-Sikit recited: [Poem in Wafir meter] A small sturdy [camel] with a sound was destined for her... when she bargained on the smooth rocks, she bargained. 'Al-Dhara'iyyah': A cloud that originated during the Nau' (star setting) of Al-Dhira', or a wind that blew at its heel. 'Al-Saqit': Frost and snow. 'Al-Balil': The cold wind. 'Al-Jaham': The cloud that has no water. Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Tha'lab informed us from Al-Riyashi, saying: A wolf used to come to the people of Qaran and harm them in their fruits. A hunter came to them and said: 'What will you give me if I catch him?' They said: 'A sheep from every flock.' He said: So he went and brought him, having tied him. They shouted 'Allahu Akbar' and began to laugh at him. He sensed betrayal from them, so he cut the rope and the wolf leaped. They leaped on him to kill him. He said: 'No harm on you, if you fulfill [the promise] to me, I will bring him back.' So they released him to bring him back. He left saying: [Poem in Basit meter] I attached a rope to the wolf then said to him... 'O catch up with your family and be safe, O wolf. If you were from the people of Qaran, then return to them... or Al-Kanizah, then go unsought.' He asked him how the best of his living was... He said: 'Passing through terrors, feared.' Al-Nahl, I am called by it as long as it has fresh dates... and if I winter, then among the sheep of the Bedouins. Some people narrate it—and it is from the narration of Qutrub—: [Poem in Basit meter] Either you lead a sheep with it so we eat it... or you sell it in some of the Bedouin [lands]. As for his saying: 'Ya al-haq bi-ahlika' (O catch up with your family): He intended: 'O this one, catch up with your family', so he implied the vocative object, as Allah Mighty and Majestic said: (Only that they prostrate to Allah) [Quran 27:25]. Just as the poet said: [Poem in Basit meter] O curse of Allah and all the people... and the righteous upon Sam'an from a neighbor.",

    "text": "As for his saying: 'fa-ud lahum' (so return to them), this is the [correct] way with Sukun on the Dal and lightening, because it is from 'ada ya'udu' (to return). Some narrated it: 'fa-udda lahum' with Tashdid (counting), and its explanation in my view is that he intended pausing on it, then transferred it for that reason, then treated the connection like the pause, as Sibawayh recited: [Rajaz] I feared that I would see drought (jadaba)... in this year of ours after it was fertile. And as he said: [Sari'] Huge, loving the huge creation (al-adkhama). As for his saying: 'kayfa kanat khayra 'ishatihi' (how was the best of his living). He made 'khayr' feminine because he added it to 'ishah' (living) and it is part of it, as they said: 'dhahabat ba'du asabi'ihi' (some of his fingers went [fem.]), and 'takharraqat ba'du hullatihi' (some of his suit tore [fem.]). As for his saying: 'faqala madin 'ala al-ahwali marhubun' (He said: passing through terrors, feared). That is from the anomalies of the Arabs, as the other said: [Wafir] So the sayers said to those I protected... so the listeners said: 'He has a vizier.' Its interpretation: 'The protected one has a vizier.' Like the saying of Allah Almighty: (And when it is said to them, \"What has your Lord sent down?\" They say, \"Legends of the former peoples\") [Quran 16:24]. Yunus said: They did not affirm that Allah sent down anything because it is mentioning the disbelievers, so they cut the answer and started [newly] and said: '(This is) legends of the former peoples.' 'Al-Nahl' is a place name, and in another narration: 'Al-Nakhl' (The Palm trees). Its most inhabited is what has fresh dates... And 'Al-Rutab': What is moist of plants, and it is 'Al-Khala' also shortened. And 'Al-Hashish': What is dry. And 'Al-Kala'' combines them. As for his saying: 'aw an tabi'ahu' (or that you sell it). He intended 'tabi'aha' (sell her/the sheep), so he deleted the Alif, and it is anomalous with no parallel in the speech of the Arabs, because only Ya and Waw connected to the pronoun are deleted, and Alif is not deleted due to its lightness. Ibn Durayd informed us, saying Abd al-Rahman informed me from his uncle, and Abu Hatim from Abu Ubaydah, they said: There was a woman among the Arabs possessing beauty, perfection, lineage, and wealth. She swore she would not marry herself except to a generous man, and if a mean man proposed to her, she would cut off his nose. People avoided her until Zayd al-Khayl, Hatim ibn Abdullah, and Aws ibn Harithah ibn La'm al-Ta'i proposed to her. They traveled to her. When they entered upon her, she said: 'Welcome to you, you were not visitors [before], so what brought you?' They said: 'We came as visitors, suitors.' She said: 'Competent, noble ones.' She lodged them, separated them, and lavished hospitality on them and increased it. When it was the second day, she sent some of her slave girls disguised as beggars exposing themselves to them. Zayd and Aws gave her half of what was carried to each of them. When she came to Hatim's saddle, he gave her all the expenses he had and loaded with her all that was carried to him. When it was the third day, they entered upon her. She said: 'Let each of you describe himself in his poetry.' Zayd hastened and recited saying: [Poem in Basit meter] Have you not asked Banu Dhubyan what is my reckoning... at the stabbing when the throats turn red. And the horses came with their chest-meats reddened... with water pouring from their upper chests, blood. And the horses know that I was their knight... on the day of Al-Aks, having in it a horn of bravery. And the neighbor knows that I am not his forsaker... if a time befalls gnawing at the bone of the neighbor. This is the praise, so if you are pleased, then [be] pleased... or if you are angry, then to me belongs whoever bends the neck. Aws ibn Harithah said: 'You know that we are more noble in lineage and more famous in deeds than to describe ourselves to you. I am the one about whom the poet says: [Poem in Wafir meter] To Aws ibn Harithah ibn La'm... to fulfill my need, and indeed he fulfilled it. No one has trodden the pebbles like Ibn Sa'da... nor wore sandals nor put them on.' 'And I am the one whose 'Aqiqah' was slaughtered, so a soul (slave) was freed for every hair of it.' Then he recited saying: [Poem in Tawil meter] So if you marry, O Mawiyah of Goodness, Hatim... then there is no one like him among us nor among the non-Arabs. Diverse, Time does not cease to be his greatest concern... ransoming a prisoner or aiding a debtor. And if you marry Zayd, then the knight of his people... when war one day makes every stander sit. And the companion of Nabhan, by whom is protected... the harm of the matter when it becomes great and aggravated. And do not marry me, [lest] you marry a non-sinner... nor a sweeper sweeping the clan, destroying. Nor one fearing a day when war tucks up... about ourselves, myself like the action of the ill-omened. And if a night-visitor of guests seeks refuge at his saddle... you will find Ibn Sa'da not delaying hospitality. So whichever youth Allah has gifted you, accept... for we are nobles from the heads of nobles. And Hatim recited saying: [Poem in Tawil meter] O Mawiyah, avoidance and abandonment have become long... and an excuse has excused me in seeking you. O Mawiyah, as for a preventer, it is clear... and as for a giving, rebuking does not restrain it.",

And the people have known that if Hatim... wanted the abundance of wealth, he would have a surplus. Until he reached the end of the poem, and it is famous. She said: 'As for you, O Zayd, you have wronged the Arabs, and your staying with a free woman is little. As for you, O Aws, you are a man of co-wives, and entering upon them is difficult. As for you, O Hatim, you are of pleasing character, praiseworthy traits, generous soul, and I have married myself to you.' Niftawayh informed us, saying Tha'lab informed us from Ibn al-A'rabi, saying: The Arabs say: Saltiness (Malahah) is in the mouth, Sweetness (Halawah) is in the eyes, and Beauty (Jamal) is in the nose. Abu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Bawadir': The flesh between the shoulders and the neck, singular is 'Badirah', and likewise 'Al-Ba'adil', singular is 'Badil'. 'Al-'Alaq': Blood. 'Al-Kashar': Shortness of teeth and their sticking to their roots; it is said from it: A man is 'Akshar'. 'Al-Bal': Length of the front teeth, and likewise 'Al-Rawq'. Abu Abdullah al-Yazidi informed us, saying my uncle Al-Fadl ibn Muhammad informed me, saying Sulayman ibn Abdullah ibn Tahir recited to me by his father: [Poem in Tawil meter] Indeed, man is but a sheath for his heart... and there is no good in a sheath if there is no blade. So if a man has a heart, then his heart... is the blade, and the human after that is surplus. Ibn Durayd informed us, saying Abd al-Rahman informed me from his uncle, saying: A Bedouin stood before Marwan ibn al-Hakam while he was allotting [stipends] to the people in Medina. He said to him: 'Allot for me.' He said: 'We have folded the book.' He said: 'Allot for me.' He said: 'We have folded the book.' He said: 'Do you not know that I am the one who said: [Poem in Wafir meter] If the generous is shaken, he increases in good... and if the mean is shaken, he does not increase.' Marwan said to him: 'I conjure you by Allah, are you the one who said it?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Allot for him.' Ibn Durayd informed us, saying Abd al-Rahman informed me from Al-Asma'i, saying: My uncle used to see bad omens in me and regard me as unlucky. Necessity used to call me to meet him to read to him, so I would not come to him until he finished his prayer. I came early one day while he was praying the morning prayer. I sat until he finished his prayer, then he turned to me and said: 'Abd al-Rahman, I seek refuge in Allah from you.' Then he turned his face to the right side, so I stood and sat opposite him. He turned his face to his left side, so I stood and sat opposite him. He turned his face away from me and put his back to me, so I stood and sat opposite him. He said: 'Bring what you have, O cursed one, and read it.' Then he recited saying: [Poem in Majzu' al-Raml] The eye's looking at this... lines the eye with a disease. Lord, You have given him to us... and he is of the worst giving. Naked, O Lord, take him... in a shirt and a cloak. Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Abdullah ibn Muslim ibn Qutaybah informed us, saying my father informed me, saying Al-Sijistani informed me, saying: I was with Al-Akhfash Sa'id ibn Mas'adah and Al-Tawwazi was with him. Al-Tawwazi said: 'What have you done regarding the Book of Masculine and Feminine, O Abu Hatim?' I said: 'We have collected something of it.' He said: 'So what do you say about Al-Firdaws?' I said: 'It is masculine.' He said: 'But Allah says: (Those who inherit Al-Firdaws, they will abide therein [fiha - fem.]) [Quran 23:11].' I said: 'He went to the meaning of Paradise (Al-Jannah - fem.), so He made it feminine, just as the Almighty said: (Whoever comes with a good deed will have ten like it [amthaliha - fem.]) [Quran 6:160], so He made it feminine while 'Mithl' (like) is masculine, because He went to the meaning of good deeds (Hasanat - fem.). And as Ibn Abi Rabi'ah said: [Poem in Tawil meter] So my shield was, before who I was fearing... three figures (shukhus - masc.), two buxom girls and a pubescent girl. So he made it feminine [implied in context of adjectives 'ka'iban'] while 'Shukhus' is masculine because he went to the [meaning of] women, and clarified that by his saying \"two buxom girls and a pubescent girl\". And as the other said: [Poem in Tawil meter] And indeed these Kilab are ten bellies (abtun - masc.)... and you are innocent of its ten tribes. So he made 'Batn' feminine while it is masculine because he meant by it the tribe.' He said to me: 'O heedless one, people say: I ask You for the Highest Firdaws (Al-Firdaws Al-A'la - masc.).' I said: 'O sleeping one, this is my proof, because 'Al-A'la' is of the attributes of masculine because it is 'Af'al', and if it were feminine He would have said 'Al-'Ulya' as 'Al-Akbar' and 'Al-Kubra', and 'Al-Asghar' and 'Al-Sughra' are said.' So he fell silent in shame. Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti informed us from Ahmad ibn Salih from Abd al-Razzaq from Ma'mar, saying: I asked Abu Amr ibn al-A'la about 'Al-'Athan', what is it? He remained silent for an hour then said: 'It is smoke without fire.' Abu al-Qasim said: It is said it is smoke ('Dukhan') and its plural is 'Dawakhin', and 'Al-'Athan' and its plural is 'Awathin', and no parallel is known for them in plurals because 'Fu'al' is not pluralized as 'Fawa'il' except these two letters. And smoke is called 'Al-Dukh' and 'Al-Dakh' and 'Al-Nuhas'. Ibn al-A'rabi recited to us: It shines like the lamp of oil... Allah did not put 'Nuhas' (smoke) in it. And he also recited: [Rajaz] There is no good in the Sheikh when he becomes crooked (ijlakha)... and the tear duct of his eye flows and creates gum (lakhaha).",

    "text": "And he was eating all of it and defecating (shakkha)... under the portico of the house covering the smoke (dukha). Abu al-Qasim said: 'Ijlakha': Became crooked. 'Lakkha' says: His eye stuck together. 'Shakkha': Says his excrement increased. 'Yaghsha al-Dukh': Says he covers the oven saying: Feed me. Ibn Durayd informed us, saying Al-Sijistani informed us from Al-Asma'i, saying: I said to some Bedouins: 'Which days are coldest?' He said: 'Al-Ahass al-Ward' and 'Al-Azibb al-Halluf'. I said: 'Explain it to me.' He said: 'Al-Ahass al-Ward' is a day whose north wind clears, its atmosphere turns red, and its sun rises, but the one who comes to it never ceases [to feel cold] because you do not find a touch [warmth] for it. And 'Al-Azibb al-Halluf' is a day in which its crosswind blows driving the waterless clouds. Ibn Durayd said: The origin of 'Hasas' is lack of hair, so as if when there were no clouds in it, he likened it to the red bald/hairless one. And 'Al-Halluf' is the camel with much fur; it is said: A 'Hallufah' beard if it is thick with hair. So he likened it to the clouds in it with this. 'Al-Jaham': Clouds with no water. Niftawayh informed us, saying Tha'lab informed us, saying Ibn Najdah informed me from Abu Zayd al-Ansari, saying: The Arabs call the two months of cold: Shayban and Milhan, due to what is seen in them of the whiteness of snow and frost. The derivation of Shayban is from 'Shayb' (gray hair) and Milhan from 'Milh' (salt). They are also called the months of 'Qimah' because water in them is disliked and abandoned, taken from 'Muqamaha' of camels, which is when they are brought to water but do not drink and raise their heads. Bishr ibn Abi Khazim said describing a ship he and his companions were in: [Poem in Wafir meter] And we are on its sides sitting... lowering the gaze like the camels refusing to drink (Qimah). The scholars of Anwa' (weather stars) claim that the duration of these two months is from the setting of Pleiades and the rising of Al-Iklil to the setting of Al-Sarf and the rising of Sa'd Bula', and those are five Anwa'. He said: And the Arabs call the opposites of these two months in heat and its intensity the days of Najir, taken from 'Najr' which is severe thirst. Dhul-Rummah said describing water he arrived at: [Poem in Tawil meter] Stagnant, altered water, the man turns his face from it... even if a thirsty man tasted it in the month of Najir. He made them wish for the fifth [day watering] and the fifth after it... and for settling and traveling the days of Najir. He repeated the rhyme twice because he committed 'Ita' (repetition) in his poetry, and the Arabs call this 'Ita'. Al-Suli recited to us, saying Ibn al-Mu'tazz recited to us for himself: [Poem in Tawil meter] And a night, those warming themselves by its fire wished... if only they were its fuel until the morning. I raised my fire in it for the one seeking hospitality... on a high place until its delegations came to me. Al-Suli said: And Tha'lab recited to me, saying Ibn al-A'rabi recited to me: [Rajaz] Your night, O lighter, is a night of cold... and the wind with that has a screech. Light [the fire], whoever passes sees your fire... if you brought a guest, you are free. Abu Ghanim al-Ma'nawi recited to us: [Poem in Munsarih meter] A day of bitter cold (*Zamharir*), chilly... upon it the pocket of the sky is buttoned. And its sun is a secluded free woman... having no light due to fog. As if the atmosphere, its filling is needles... and the earth beneath it is glass bottles. Al-Akhfash recited to us, saying Tha'lab recited to us for Nuwayfi' ibn Nufay', saying: [Poem in Kamil meter] A south wind departed for its intent in the morning... and you were moved with joy, while you did not know you were joyful. And we were neighbors, and she abandons our house... until she departs or it is said [he is] suspicious. And visiting the house in which is not sought... other than their conversation is defective. And youth sways with me to childish passion... sometimes, then experience judges my opinion. And the young girl pillowed me her right hand... and her left, the plump, tender one. Protruding of the rear, you do not see for her ankles... a sharpness, and her shin has no shinbone edge. Her buttocks became large and her creation complete... and the two parents are a noble woman and a noble man. When gray hair unloaded its weights upon me... and I knew that my youth was the stolen one. She said: 'You have aged, and every owner of pleasure... Layla, returns, and that is the graying.' Is there for me a doctor for the destroying old age... so I return naive, and youth is wonderful. My peers and youth have gone, so I have no... counterpart among those you see of people. And when the years persist in seeking the youth... the years catch up and the sought is overtaken. So away with you! For no knower knows... from where his written fortune is gathered. The youth strives to attain the best of his endeavor... Far is that! And before that are calamities. He strives and hopes while death is behind him... ascending the hills, having a watcher over him. Neither is death despising of the small so turning... away from him, nor is the age of the old respected.",

    "text": "And if I have aged, I have lived long as if I were... a branch the winds shade, moist. And likewise truly whoever lives long, the turning... of time upon him and the overturning wears him out. Until he returns from decay as if he is... in the hand, a broken arrow-notch, without head, bound. Stripped of feathers, there is no artifice in it... neither the feathers benefit it nor the binding. Shu'ub (Death) went with his family and his wealth... Indeed deaths are Shu'ub (separators) for men. And the man, from the doubt of time, is as if he is... a camel the shepherds took turns on, ridden. A target for every death shot at... until his erected blackness (person) is hit. Abu al-Qasim said: Nothing came in the speech of the Arabs pluralized on 'Fi'al' except six letters. That is their saying: 'Zi'r' and 'Zi'ar' (wet nurse), 'Anz Rubba' and 'A'nuz Ribab': for the newly birthing, 'Tu'am' and 'Tu'am' (twin), 'Arq' and 'Iraq' (sweat/root?), 'Rakhl' and 'Rikhal' (female lamb), and 'Farir' and 'Firar': for the calf of the wild cow. And among what came as dual and no singular was articulated for it is their saying: He came striking his 'Azdarayh' (shoulders/sides), if he came empty-handed. Likewise he came striking his 'Asdarayh'. And it is said of a man if he threatens and there is nothing behind that: He came shaking his 'Mudhrawayh', and it is also said like that if he came empty with nothing with him. And it is said: 'Al-Shiyy' (Listening/Look?), 'Hawalayna' (around us) in the dual form only, and no singular was isolated for it except in anomalous poetry. [Rajaz] They demolished your house, may you have no father... and they claimed that I, may I have no maternal uncle. And I walk the wolf-walk around you (*Hawalaka*). And from that: 'Dawalayka', and the meaning is turn after turn, and no singular is isolated for it. Abd Bani al-Has-has said: [Poem in Tawil meter] As if the Subayri women, the day they met us... were gazelles that lent their gaze to the wild cows. And they are the daughters of the people; if they sense us... there will be among the daughters of the people one of the calamities. How many a shining cloak we have torn... and a veil from a young girl, not a spinster. If a garment is torn, the like of it is torn with the garment... turn after turn (*Dawalayka*) until all of us are not wearing. And from that is 'Hananayk', and its meaning is compassion after compassion. It is only used like this, accusative in the dual form because it is a verbal noun (Masdar). And 'Dadd' was singularized and used established. Sibawayh recited: [Poem in Tawil meter] So Hanan (Compassion) said: What brought you here... are you of lineage or do you know the tribe? Its estimation is: Our matter is compassion (*Hananun*), so he raised it as inchoative and predicate. The meaning of 'Hanan' is mercy and affection. And from that is 'Hadhadhayk', he only means cutting (*Hadhdhan*) after cutting. 'Al-Hadhdh' is cutting, and its singular is used. Sibawayh recited: [Split Rajaz] A striking (*Hadhadhayk*) and stabbing and piercing. And from that is 'Labbayk' and 'Sa'dayk'. They are only used like this in the dual form. Sibawayh said: I asked Al-Khalil about its derivation and meaning. He said: The meaning of 'Labbayk' is from 'Al-Ilbab'. It is said 'Alabba al-rajulu bi-al-makan ilbaban': If he stayed in it. So if he says 'Labbayk', it is as if he said: I am staying upon Your obedience and at Your command. And 'Sa'dayk' is taken from 'Al-Is'ad', and 'Al-Is'ad' and 'Al-Musa'adah' (assistance) are the same. So if he says to Allah Mighty and Majestic 'Labbayk wa Sa'dayk' in the Talbiyah, it is as if he said: I am staying at Your command and following it, so he has drawn near to Him by his desire not his body. This is the meaning of Al-Khalil's saying and his explanation. Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti told us, saying Muhammad ibn Isra'il al-Jawhari told us, saying Mu'awiyah told us from his father from Qatadah from Abd al-Malik ibn Umayr from some of Banu Abi al-Mu'alla: A man from the Ansar from his father from his grandfather said: The Prophet (PBUH) said while on the pulpit: 'Indeed my foot is upon a 'Tur'ah' (step/basin) of the 'Tur'as' of the Haud (Basin).' And he said: 'Indeed a servant from the servants of Allah, Allah gave him the choice between living in the world as long as he wishes to live and eating from the world as long as he wishes to eat, and between meeting his Lord. So the servant chose meeting his Lord.' He said: So Abu Bakr wept when he said it: We ransom you, O Messenger of Allah, with our fathers. Abu al-Qasim said: And the narration is connected from more than one path that the Prophet (PBUH) said this in his illness in which he died, announcing his death to his companions. And this Hadith has another wording. Abu Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Razi told us from Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz from Abu Ubayd al-Qasim ibn Sallam, saying Isma'il ibn Ja'far ibn Amr ibn Alqamah told me regarding this: Upon a 'Tur'ah' of the 'Tur'as' of Paradise. Abu al-Qasim said: And scholars have three opinions regarding 'Al-Tur'ah': Abu Amr al-Shaybani said: 'Al-Tur'ah': The step/degree. And others said 'Al-Tur'ah': The door. And Abu Ubaydah said 'Al-Tur'ah': The garden (Rawdah) that is in a high place specifically. If it is in a low place, it is a 'Rawdah'. He recites for Al-A'sha: [Poem in Basit meter] Not a garden ('Rawdah') of the gardens of the rugged ground, grassy... green, upon which a pouring rain was generous.",

    "text": "A bright star laughs at the sun from it... wrapped in dense plants, mature. [Not] a day more pleasant than her in spreading scent... nor more beautiful than her when the evening approached. Al-Asma'i said: Abu Amr ibn al-A'la said: Nothing has been said in describing the beauty of women and the goodness of their scent better than this poetry nor more eloquent. Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Al-Mubarrad informed us, saying Al-Mada'ini said: It was narrated from Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The rational person must have three qualities: To be knowing of his time, master of his tongue, attentive to his affair. And Umar ibn al-Khattab said: Whoever his manners sit him down (hold him back), his lineage will not raise him up. And Abu Bakr al-Siddiq said: Piety is the lineage (Hasab). Ibn Durayd informed us, saying Abu Hatim informed us, saying Abu Ubaydah informed me, saying: Al-Kumayt went out to Aban ibn Abdullah al-Bajali while he was over Khurasan, so he made him among his night-companions. Al-Kumayt had envy. While he was one night chatting with him, Aban dozed off, and the people debated about generosity and munificence. One of them said: Generosity died the day Al-Fayyad (generous one) died. He raised his voice, so Al-Bajali woke up and said: 'What are you discussing?' Al-Kumayt said: [Poem in Khafif meter] Al-Nadr, Al-Mughira, Al-Nu'man, Al-Buhturi, and Ibn Iyad claimed... He said: 'Woe to you! What did they claim, O Abu al-Mustahill?' He said: That the generosity of mankind died entirely... the day the death of Al-Fayyad went. He said: 'So what did you say to them, O Abu al-Mustahill?' He said: I said: They lied, by the One whom the riders answer... quickly in the wide open spaces. Dew and generosity do not die as long as... Aban lives, the rain of the destitute. So if the God calls Aban... He announces that generosity after him is extinct. He said to him: 'You have done well, so ask your need.' He said: 'You give me ten thousand dirhams for every verse.' He said: 'I will do it and increase you ten thousand from myself.' So he ordered sixty thousand dirhams for him. Al-Akhfash informed me, saying my father informed me from my grandfather from Isma'il ibn Nubakht, saying: Abu Nuwas aimed for one of the Nubakhtis among the scribes. Some ancestors of that scribe used to write for some of the Chosroes. Chosroes became angry at some of his concubines, so he handed her to that Nubakhti scribe and ordered him to kill her. He disliked killing her, and the King's soul followed (desired) her, and he feared that if he kept her alive, he would accuse him regarding her. So he kept her alive and castrated himself. Then the King's soul followed her, so he carried her to him, and informed him of what he did to himself. He considered that great and said: 'Your reward is nothing but that I gather my elite and seat you on my neck.' The King's ministers envied him and said to him: 'This is ugly, but let the King order that a crown be crafted for him and his image be depicted in it, then place it on his head.' He did so. So Abu Nuwas said mentioning this story: [Poem in Kamil meter] What need does 'Alaq al-Huda' have in its success... compared to a need attached to Abu Tammam? Indeed men saw your father with eyes... lined for them with the kohl-sticks of bones. So if you extend a hand to me with a gift... I have indeed shaken you the shake of the sharp sword. So he sent him four thousand dirhams, and he did not own other than them. Ibn Shuqayr informed us, saying Tha'lab informed us from Ibn Shabbah, saying: Ramlah bint Ubayd Allah ibn Ma'mar was married to Hisham ibn Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik. One day a conversation occurred between them, and he said to her: 'You are a mule, you do not give birth.' So she said: 'Shh! My nobility refuses to mix with your baseness.' Abu al-Abbas said: Similar to this among silencing answers is what is narrated about Al-Khansa when she entered upon Aisha and recited to her her saying about her brother Sakhr: [Poem in Wafir meter] O Sakhr, if you have made my eye weep... you have indeed made me laugh for a long time. I wept for you among wailing women... and I was the most deserving of those who showed wailing. I repelled calamities with you while you were alive... so who will repel the great calamity? When weeping over a killed one is ugly... I saw your weeping as good and beautiful. So Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said to her: 'Do you weep for Sakhr while he is a coal in the Fire?' She said: 'O Mother of the Believers: That is stronger for my grief over him and more inciting for my weeping.' Ibn Durayd recited to us, saying Abd al-Rahman recited to us from his uncle by Muhammad ibn Bashir ibn Adwan: [Poem in Kamil meter] What an excellent youth his brothers were bereaved of... on the day of Al-Baqi' by the accidents of days. Easy of courtyard when you settle at his door... open-handed, having disciplined servants. And if you saw his full brother and his friend... you would not know which of them are the possessors of wombs (relatives). Niftawayh informed us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi, saying: 'Al-Fasit' with Fa: Nail clipping. 'Al-Saffit' with the delayed Fa: The generous man. 'Al-Saqit' with Qaf: The foolish man. 'Al-Safit' also: Snow and frost. 'Al-Rabit': The monk. And 'Al-Arbat': The fool.",

    "text": "And the Arabs say: So-and-so, due to his gluttony (*shartatihi*), does not know his 'Latta' from his 'Lahat'. And some of them say: He does not know his 'Qata' from his 'Latta'. 'Al-Qata': The anus. 'Al-Latta': The forehead. 'Al-Batit': Wonder. 'Al-Atit': Hunger. 'Al-Atit' also: The sound of the stretching of leather and similar things. 'Al-Hadirah': The small group raiding. He recites: [Poem in Kamil meter] He comes to the waters as a raiding group (*Hadirah*) and a scout group (*Nafidah*)... the coming of the sandgrouse when the shadow (*al-Taba'*) shrinks (*isma'alla*). 'Al-Taba'': The shadow. 'Isma'alla': Shrunk. Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Rustam al-Tabari informed us, saying Al-Mazini informed us, saying: I was with Al-Akhfash and Al-Riyashi was with us. Al-Akhfash said: That 'Mudh' (since), if nominative is used with it, it is an inchoative noun and what follows it is a predicate, like your saying: 'I haven't seen him *mudh yawmani* (since two days).' And if genitive is used with it, it is a preposition particle, a meaning not a noun, like your saying: 'I haven't seen him *mudh al-yawmi* (since today).' Al-Riyashi said: 'Why shouldn't it be a noun in both places? For we see nouns taking accusative and genitive, like our saying: This is *daribu Zaydin* (hitter of Zayd) *amsi* (yesterday). So why shouldn't *Mudh* be in this status?' Al-Akhfash did not bring a convincing answer. So I said: '*Mudh* does not resemble what you mentioned of nouns, because we have not seen nouns sticking to one position like this unless they resemble meaning particles like *Ayna* (where) and *Kayfa* (how). Likewise *Mudh* resembles particles, so it stuck to one position.' Abu Ja'far said: So Abu Ya'la ibn Abi Zur'ah said to Al-Mazini: 'Have you seen a meaning particle performing two opposing functions?' He said: 'Yes, like your saying: The people stood *hasha Zaydin* (except Zayd - genitive) and *hasha Zaydan* (accusative verb meaning), and *ala Zaydin thawbun* (on Zayd is a garment - prep), and *ala Zaydun al-jabala* (Zayd ascended the mountain - verb). So it is once a particle and once a verb with one wording.' Abu al-Qasim said: This which Abu Uthman said is correct, except that he was obliged to clarify which particle *Mudh* resembled? Just as we knew that *Mata* and *Kayfa* resemble the Hamza of interrogation. And to clarify what is the mode of nominative with *Mudh* and what is the operator in it? The saying in that is that *Mudh*, when genitive is used with it in your saying: 'I haven't seen him *mudh al-yawmi*', resembles *Min* (from) because *Min* is for the beginning of limits, and *Mudh*, if the Nun is with it (*Mundhu*), is for the beginning of limits in time specifically. So *Mudh* occurred with the meaning of *Mundhu* in this place. And *Mundhu* is in the status of *Min*, so their resemblance is clear. As for the saying regarding the nominative with it in your saying: 'I haven't seen him *mudh yawmani*', this is not valid except as two sentences, because if you made the seeing fall upon *Mudh*, it would be cut off from what follows it and it would have no nominative operator. But it is on the estimation of your saying: 'I haven't seen him', then you say to the speaker: 'How long is the duration of that?' He says: 'Two days', i.e., the duration of that is two days. So he raised it as inchoative and predicate. Niftawayh informed us, saying Tha'lab said: Some of our companions asked me about the saying of the poet: [Rajaz] She brought it ashy, baked in hot ash (*mamulla*)... not raw (*ma niyya*) *allin* (?), *khamma* (?) when *ala* (?). I did not know what he was saying, so I went to Ibn al-A'rabi and asked him about it. He explained it to me saying: This describes a loaf of bread a woman baked but did not cook thoroughly. He said: 'She brought it *murammadan* i.e., soiled with ash. *Mamulla* in the *Mallah*, which is the embers and hot ash. Then he said: *Ma niyya allin*: *Ma* is extra, as if he said *Niyya*. And *Al-All*: Its face, meaning the face of the loaf. And his saying *khamma*: Means it changed/spoiled. *Hina ala* i.e., when she was slow in cooking. It is said *ala al-rajulu*: If he slackened and slowed in work. He recited: [Wafir] My sons did not slacken (*ma alu*) nor did they do evil. Al-Akhfash recited to us for Abu Nuwas: [Poem in Tawil meter] And a house of drinking companions they left empty and departed at night... in it is a trace of them, new and effaced. Drag marks of dragging waterskins on the soil... and bundles of basil, fresh and dry. My companions stopped me at it, so I renewed their covenant... and indeed I am at the likes of those, stopping. And I did not know what they were other than what testified to it... the balconies of the Sabat (covered passage) of the houses, the empty lands. We stayed in it a day and a day and its third... and a day to which the day of departure was a fifth. Wine is circulated among us in an 'Asjadiyyah' (golden cup)... which Persia endowed with types of pictures. Its bottom is Khosrow, and on its sides... are wild cows ('Maha') which horsemen drive with bows. So the wine covers what his pockets were buttoned over... and the water covers what the caps circled upon. Abu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Dar': The dwelling of the people, whether built or unbuilt. And it is said:",

    "text": "'Dar' and 'Darah'. 'Al-Basabis': The wastelands, singular 'Basbas', and like it 'Al-Sabasib', singular 'Sabsab', and its origin is the wide smooth desert. 'Al-'Asjadiyyah': A cup made of 'Asjad' which is gold. His saying: 'Qararatuha Kisra' (Its bottom is Khosrow) is accusative as an adverb/place, meaning that in the bottom of the cup—which is its floor—was the picture of Khosrow. And on its sides, meaning its edges, was a picture of 'Maha' which are wild cows, and pictures of horsemen with bows and arrows in their hands shooting those Maha. This is the meaning of his saying 'Tudriha bi-al-qisiyyi al-fawaris'. 'Al-Dari'ah': The thing that is shot at. Meaning that he poured wine into the cup until it reached the picture of the throats of the horsemen, which is the place of the buttons. Then he poured water to the amount of the heads of the figures, which is what the caps cover. Isma'il al-Warraq told us, saying Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Basri in Mecca told us, saying Isma'il ibn Abdullah ibn Khalid told us from his father from his grandfather from Yunus ibn Yasar from Abu Huraira who said: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: 'Feed food, spread peace, and be, O servants of Allah, brothers as Allah commanded you. Do not practice Najsh (bidding up prices), do not turn your backs on one another, and let not some of you sell over the sale of others.' Abu al-Qasim said: The meaning of his saying: 'Do not practice Najsh' says: Let not one of you increase the price of a commodity if he does not intend to buy it, lest one who has no insight into the commodity looks at him and is deceived by him. The origin of 'Najsh' is: stirring up a thing, and from it is Al-Najashi. Muhammad ibn Ishaq used to say: The name Al-Najashi is the name of the king, like their saying Caesar and Heraclius, and it seems his name was Ashamah in their language and its interpretation in Arabic is 'Atiyyah' (Gift). His saying 'Do not turn your backs on one another' says: Do not cut off ties and do not abandon one another, for those abandoning each other, if each turns away from his companion, he has turned his back to him. It is said: 'Bi'tu al-shay'a': If you sold it and removed it from your hand. And 'Bi'tuhu': If you bought it. It is used for both opposites together. And it is said 'Aba'tu al-shay'a': If you offered it for sale. He recites: [Poem in Kamil meter] I was pleased with the boons of the Kumayt (horse), so whoever sells... a horse, our steed is not 'Mumba'' (sold/offered for sale). i.e., offered for sale. Abu al-Qasim al-Sa'igh informed us, saying Ibn Qutaybah informed us, saying: It was narrated that the delegation of Hamdan came to the Prophet (PBUH) and met him returning from Tabuk. Malik ibn Namat al-Hamdani stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, a choice group (Nasiyah) from Hamdan from every settled and Bedouin [area], came to you on swift young camels, connected by the ropes of Islam, from the Mikhlaf of Kharif and Yam. The blame of a blamer does not take them in [the path of] Allah. Their covenant is not broken by the year of a barren drought (*Mahil*), nor a dark calamity (*Sawda' 'Anqafir*), as long as [Mount] La'la' stands, and the gazelle runs on the smooth land.' So the Prophet (PBUH) wrote to him: 'This is a writing from Muhammad the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, to the Mikhlaf of Kharif and the people of Jinab al-Hadb and Hiqaf al-Raml with their delegate Malik ibn Namat and those of his people who embraced Islam. That for them is their rough ground (*'Azaz*), their low ground (*Wahata*), and their high ground (*Fira'*), as long as they establish prayer and give Zakat. They graze their *'Ilaf* (fodder/trees?) and eat their *'Afa'* (fruit?). And for us from their *Dif'* (camels) and *Siram* (palms/harvest) is what they handed over by pact and trust. And for them from the Sadaqah is the *Thalb* (old camel), the *Nab* (old she-camel), the *Fasil* (weaned camel), the *Farid* (old?) *Dajin* (domestic), and the *Kabsh al-Huwari*. And upon them is the *Saligh* (six-year-old) and the *Qarih* (five-year-old?).' His saying: 'Nasiyah'. He says we are a 'Nasiyah' from Hamdan, so he raised it because it is a predicate of a deleted inchoative. 'Al-Nasiyah': The chosen leaders. It is said: 'Intasaytu al-shay'a' if you chose it. Its origin is from 'Al-Nasiyah' (forelock) just as 'Al-Ru'asa' (leaders) is from 'Al-Ra's' (head). 'Al-Qulus': A group of 'Qalus', which is the young female camel. Al-Asma'i said: The 'Qalus' among she-camels is like the young woman among women, and the 'Jamal' is like the man, and the 'Ba'ir' is like the human, applying to male and female. 'Al-Nawaji': The swift ones, singular 'Najiyah'. 'Al-Naja'': Speed, lengthened and shortened. Some thieves of the regions said: [Rajaz] If you take the spoil, then speed, speed (*Al-Naja Al-Naja*)... Indeed I fear the seeker, the swift ostrich-like (*Al-Safanja*). Kharif and Yam are two tribes. 'Al-Mikhlaf' for the people of Yemen is like 'Al-Ajnad' for the people of Syria, 'Al-Kuwar' for the people of Iraq, 'Al-Tasasij' for the people of Ahwaz, and 'Al-Rasatitiq' for the people of Jibal. His saying: 'Their covenant is not broken by the year of a *Mahil* (barren one).' 'Al-Mahil': The slanderer/intriguer. It is said: 'Mahala bihi' to the Sultan. 'Al-Sawda' al-'Anqafir': The calamity. 'Al-Sunnah': The way/year (context implies year of drought or method). He wants that they do not deviate from the covenant due to the striving of a slanderer, nor due to a great hardship that befalls them. 'La'la'': A specific mountain. 'Al-Ya'fur': The calf of the cow/gazelle. 'Al-Sala'': The smooth earth. 'Al-Fira'': The tops of mountains and high things, singular 'Far'ah'. 'Al-Far'ah' in other contexts: The louse, and from it Hassan ibn al-Fari'ah. 'Al-Wahata': What is depressed of the earth. 'Al-'Azaz': What is hard of it, and it is like the skin. 'Al-Dif'': Camels, named so because what is used for warmth is taken from their fur. 'Al-Siram': Palm trees because they are harvested (*Tusram*), and it is possible that 'Al-Siram' is the dates themselves. 'Al-Thalb': The old male camel. 'Al-Nab': The old she-camel.",

    "text": "'Al-Farid': The old one that is not young. 'Al-Dajin': That which is fed in the house and not sent to pastures. 'Al-Sali' ' from cows and sheep is what completed and finished a year, and that is in the sixth year. 'Al-Qarih' is like it from horses. 'Al-Kabsh al-Huwari': Ibn Qutaybah mentioned that it is a type of ram with red skin, and I do not know from what it is derived since what is known in the language is that 'Al-Hawar' is whiteness, and from it the bleachers were called 'Hawariyun' for their whitening of clothes. Al-Yazidi informed us, saying my uncle Al-Fadl ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Muhammad al-Yazidi informed me from his father from his grandfather, saying: Some of our companions informed me saying: I passed in the region of Najd by a Bedouin girl as if she were a piece of the moon, looking with two large eyes with eyelashes like the primary feathers of the vulture. I never saw more perfect perfection than her. I stood looking at her and her beauty, and beside her was an old woman. The old woman said: 'What is your standing over this Najdi gazelle, when you have no share in it?' The girl said: 'Leave him, by Allah, O mother, let it be what Dhul-Rummah said: [Poem in Tawil meter] My two friends, my need from your passion passed me... and who consoles the soul except its friend? Dismount at Mayy's [abode] before distance casts... us a casting place, or before separation removes her. And even if it is only a stop for an hour... a little, for indeed a little of her is beneficial to me.' Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Tha'lab informed us, saying Hammad ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Mawsili told me from his father, saying: A man from the family of Abu Ja'far loved a singing girl. Her matter became long for him and her cost heavy. So he said one day to some of his brothers: 'This one has distracted me from many of my affairs, so come with us to her so I may reveal myself to her and leave her, for I have found some solace.' When he came to her, he said to her: 'Do you sing the saying of the poet: [Poem in Wafir meter] I used to love you, but I have found solace from you... Peace be upon you in your dwellings.' She said: 'No, but I sing the saying of the sayer: [Poem in Wafir meter] Her people departed from me so they separated... upon traces which the dust has obliterated.' The youth became shy and lowered his head and increased in wonder and fondness for her. He said to her: 'Do you sing the saying of the sayer: [Poem in Tawil meter] And I submit to the blame if I was unjust... and if I was wronged, I was the one who apologizes.' She said: 'Yes, and the saying of the sayer: [Poem in Tawil meter] If you approach with love, we approach with the like... and if you turn away, I go to a worn-out state.' So they broke up in two verses and united in two verses, and no one was aware of them. Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Al-Mubarrad informed us, saying: I entered in my youth, I and a friend of mine from the people of literature, into some monasteries to look at madmen who were described to us. We saw wonders among them, until we reached a young man in a room among them, clean of face and clothing, on a clean mat, holding a mirror and a comb, looking in the mirror and combing his beard. I said: 'What seats you here while you are different from these?' He raised his glance and inclined another and recited saying: [Poem in Kamil meter] Allah knows that I am lovesick... unable to spread what I find. Two souls I have; a soul a land divides it... and another a land has possessed. And if the resident one, patience does not benefit it... it finds what I find. I said to him: 'I see you are in love.' He said: 'Yes.' I said: 'With whom?' He said: 'You are indeed inquisitive.' I said: 'Beneficent if you informed.' He said: 'My father contracted a marriage for me to a female cousin of mine, but he died before I could consummate the marriage with her. He left great wealth. So my uncle seized all the wealth and imprisoned me in this monastery and claimed that I am mad. And the custodian of the monastery meanwhile says to us: \"Beware of him for he is changing now.\"' Then he said to me: 'Recite something to me for I think you are of the people of literature.' I said to my companion: 'Recite.' So he recited: [Poem] I kissed her mouth in fear, stealing... like the seeker of fire who did not perceive due to haste. What is upon a watcher in the house if they neglected... me so I kissed her ten times slowly? Lower your eyelids from me and look from near... for lovers are only exposed by eyes. He said to me: 'Father of whom [is your Kunya], may I be your ransom?' I said: 'Abu al-Abbas.' He said: 'O Abu al-Abbas, I and this youth are at the two extremes. This one is neighboring the one he loves, facing obtaining from him, and I am distant, excluded. So by Allah, you recite something to me.' Nothing came to me at the time except the saying of Umar ibn Abi Rabi'ah: [Poem in Kamil meter] Sukaynah said while tears were shedding... running upon the cheeks and the Jilbab. Would that Al-Mughiri whom I did not reward... in what prolonged my patience and my seeking. His days used to return desires to us... when no blame was cast on a passion and one was struck [by love]. I was told what she said, so I spent the night as if... shooting the vitals with right-hitting arrows. O Sukaynah, the water of the Euphrates and its goodness... is not—to a thirsty one and love is a drink—More delicious than you, even if you are far, and rarely... do women observe the trust of the absent. Then I said to him: 'You recite something else to us.' So he recited saying: [Poem in Majzu' al-Wafir meter] Clarify to me, O Ruins... about the loved ones, what did they do? Do you see they traveled, do you see they settled... in the land of Sham or departed? My companion said to him jokingly and playfully: 'They died.' He said: 'Woe to you, they died?' He said: 'Yes, they died.' He became agitated and his eyes turned red and he intended to leap, so we moved away from him. He began striking his head on the ground saying: 'Woe to you, they died.' Until his matter terrified us, so we left him. Then we returned after days and asked the owner of the monastery about him. He said: 'That remained his state until he died.' Ibn Durayd informed us, saying Abu Hatim informed me from Al-Asma'i, saying: The Arabs say: So-and-so returned 'fi hafiratahi' (in his original state), and returned 'adrajahu' (his steps), and returned 'awdahu 'ala bad'ihi' (his return upon his beginning) if he returned on the road from which he came. He said: And 'Al-Nafir' and plural 'Anfar': Those who mobilize for their needs, in raiding and other than that. As for their saying: 'La fi al-'ir wa la fi al-nafir' (Neither in the caravan nor in the mobilization), it was said on the Day of Badr. A conversation occurred in Islam between Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan and Amr al-Ashdaq. Amr said to Yazid: 'Be silent, for you are neither in the caravan nor in the mobilization.' Yazid said to his sitters: 'Indeed this fool heard a word so he loved to exemplify with it, but he did not know how to place it in its place. He says to me: I am not in the caravan nor in the mobilization. Yet the owner of the caravan was my grandfather Abu Sufyan, and the owner of the mobilization was my grandfather Utbah ibn Rabi'ah.' Niftawayh informed us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi regarding the saying of the poet: [Rajaz] What is wrong with the camels, their walking is slow (*wa'ida*)... Is it boulders they carry or iron? Or 'Sarfan' (lead/death/dates), cold, severe... Or men, crouching, sitting? He said: 'Al-Sarfan': Lead. Some linguists say: 'Al-Sarfan': Death. Some of them said regarding this verse: The dates: Al-Sarfan itself. Most scholars are on the first opinion. 'Al-Shanf': What is hung in the ear from its top. 'Al-Qurt': What is hung in its bottom. 'Al-'Arr': The ring of the earring. Abu al-Qasim said: His saying 'mashyuha' (their walking) he made genitive as a substitute (*Badal*) for 'Al-Jamal' (the camels) because the meaning encompasses it. The estimation is: What is wrong with the walking of the camels being slow (*wa'ida*), i.e., heavy. And he made 'wa'ida' accusative as a state (*Hal*). 'Al-Qabus': Groups, as if it is plural of 'Qabis' like 'Darib' and 'Durrab', and 'Sa'im' and 'Suwwam'. 'Al-Qibs' with Kasra on Qaf and Sukun on Ba: The large number of people. Abu Muhammad Isma'il ibn al-Najm al-Sharabi informed us, saying: We were in the assembly of Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad on a severely cold day. Isma'il ibn Zarzur the singer passed by us, wearing a fine linen undergarment and a brocade saddle-cover (?), and on his head a Dabiqi handkerchief, and on his foot a squeaking sandal. He passed and did not greet. Al-Mubarrad said to us: 'Who is this?' We said: 'Ibn Zarzur the singer.' He said: 'Write: Your singing earns you accusations of adultery... and slapping and expulsion from buildings. And slandering you is more beautiful than being righteous... and insulting you is more fitting than using Kunya (honorifics). So the day of your birth is for condolences... and the day of your death is for congratulations.' Another recited to us for Ibn Bassam: [Poem in Kamil meter] Equal are the one whose earning is by slapping... or the one who has slaughter in his singing. Their states in slapping are one... there is no span between their earners. Niftawayh told us, saying Al-Hunayni told us from Al-Husayn ibn Muhammad from Shayban from Qatadah regarding the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic (And you see the sun when it rises, declining (*tazzawaru*) away from their cave to the right, and when it sets, lending them (*taqriduhum*) to the left) [Quran 18:17]. He said: Its meaning is leaving them to the left while they are in a gap within it. When he said [gap], he means: in a space of the cave. Abu al-Qasim said: The origin of *tazzawaru* is *tatazawaru*, so the second Ta was changed to Zay and assimilated into the one after it, so it was said *tazzawaru*. And 'Al-Azwar': The inclined/crooked. Regarding *taqriduhum*, there are opinions. Some linguists said: Its meaning is leaving them to the right as Qatadah said. Others said: Passing them to the left, which is the school of Abu Ubaydah. He said: And it is said: Did you pass by such and such place? The questioned one says: *Qaradtuhu* at night, i.e., passed it at night. Another recited for Dhul-Rummah: [Poem in Tawil meter] To litters passing (*yaqridna*) the middle parts of Mushrif... quickly, while on their right sides are the horsemen. Others said: *Taqriduhum* to the left, i.e., turns away from them.",

    "text": "“Oh poor one, is the water of the Euphrates and its sweetness... a favor to a thirst, and the love of a drink / More delicious than you? Even if you are far, and rarely... do women keep the trust of those absent.” Then I said to him, “Recite something else for us.” So he began to say (in the Majzu’ al-Wafir meter): “Explain to me, O ruins... regarding the loved ones, what have they done? / Do you see that they traveled? Do you see that they settled... in the land of Sham, or have they departed?” My companion said to him, jokingly and playfully: “They died.” He said: “Woe to you, they died?” He replied: “Yes, they died.” He became agitated, his eyes turned red, and he attempted to jump up, so we moved away from him. He began striking his head against the ground saying, “Woe to you, they died,” until his condition terrified us and we left him. We returned after a few days and asked the owner of the monastery about him. He said: “That remained his state until he died.” Ibn Durayd told us, saying Abu Hatim told me on the authority of Al-Asma'i, who said: The Arabs say, “So-and-so returned in his tracks [fi hafiratibhi],” “returned his steps [adrajahu],” and “returned his ending to his beginning [‘awdahu ‘ala bad’ihi]” when he returns on the path he came from. He said: The 'Nafir' and the plural 'Anfar' are those who mobilize for their needs, in raids and otherwise. As for their saying: “Neither in the 'Ir [caravan] nor in the Nafir [mobilization],” it was said on the Day of Badr. In the Islamic era, a dispute occurred between Yazid bin Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan and ‘Amr al-Ashdaq. ‘Amr said to Yazid: “Be silent, for you are neither in the ‘Ir nor in the Nafir.” Yazid said to those sitting with him: “This fool heard a phrase and wanted to use it as a proverb, but he did not know how to place it in its context. He says to me, 'You are neither in the ‘Ir nor in the Nafir,' yet the leader of the ‘Ir was my grandfather Abu Sufyan, and the leader of the Nafir was my grandfather Utbah bin Rabi’ah.” Niftawayh told us on the authority of Tha’lab on the authority of Ibn al-A’rabi regarding the poet’s saying (in Rajaz meter): “What is wrong with the camels walking slowly [wa’idan]... Are they carrying rocks or iron? / Or cold, hard ‘Sarfan’... or men sitting heavily?” He said: ‘Sarfan’ is lead. Some linguists say: ‘Sarfan’ is death. Some said regarding this verse: It is the dates called ‘Sarfan’ itself, but most scholars hold the first view. The ‘Shanf’ is what is hung from the upper part of the ear. The ‘Qurt’ is what is hung from the lower part. The ‘Urr’ is the ring of the Qurt. Abu al-Qasim said: The phrase “mashiya-ha” [their walking] is in the genitive case as a substitute [Badal] for “the camels” because the meaning encompasses it. The estimation is: “What is wrong with the walking of the camels being slow [wa’idan]?” meaning heavy. “Wa’idan” is in the accusative case as a circumstantial adverb [Hal]. ‘Qabs’: groups, as if it is the plural of ‘Qabis’, similar to ‘Darib’ and ‘Darrab’, and ‘Sa’im’ and ‘Sawwam’. ‘Qibs’ with a kasra on the Qaf and sukoon on the Ba is a large number of people. Abu Muhammad Ismail bin al-Najm al-Sharabi told us: We were in the gathering of Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad on a very cold day. Ismail bin Zarzur the singer passed by us wearing a tunic of Qasab [fine linen/gut] and a brocade saddle-cover, with a Dabiqi kerchief on his head and squeaking sandals on his feet. He passed without greeting. Al-Mubarrad said to us: “Who is this?” We said: “Ibn Zarzur the singer.” He said: “Write down: 'Your singing earns you accusation... and a slap and expulsion from the buildings / Casting you out is more beautiful than being kind to you... and insulting you is more fitting than using a polite title / The day of your birth is for condolences... and the day of your death is for congratulations.'” Someone else recited to us lines by Ibn Bassam: “It is the same whether one earns by being slapped... or one for whom slaughter is the reward for his singing / The condition of both in regards to slapping is one... there is only a span between their earners.” Niftawayh told us, saying Al-Hunaini told us on the authority of Al-Hussein bin Muhammad on the authority of Shayban on the authority of Qatada regarding the saying of Allah Almighty: {And you see the sun when it rises, inclining away [tazzawaru] from their cave to the right, and when it sets, passing them [taqriduhum] to the left} [Al-Kahf: 17]. He said: It means it leaves them to the left while they are in an open space within it. He says: In a spacious part of the cave. Abu al-Qasim said: The origin of ‘tazzawaru’ is ‘tatazawaru’, so the second Ta was changed to a Zay and assimilated into the one following it, so it was said ‘tazzawaru’. The ‘Azwar’ is the slanted/inclined one. Regarding ‘taqriduhum’ there are opinions. Some linguists said: It means it leaves them to the right, as Qatada said. Others said: It bypasses them to the left, which is the school of Abu Ubaida. He said: It is said, “Did you pass by such and such place?” The questioned one says: “Qaradtuhu [I passed it] at night,” meaning I bypassed it at night. Someone else recited lines by Dhu al-Rummah: “Toward women in howdahs who cut across [yaqridna] the middle of Mushrif... quickly, while the horsemen are on their right.” Others said: ‘Taqriduhum’ to the left means it turns away from them.",

    "text": "Ibn Shuqayr narrated from Tha'lab that he said: Al-Kisa'i and Al-Farra said: It is from alignment. It is said: 'Qaradana' the thing and 'Hadhani', 'Yaqriduni' and 'Yahdhuni', and 'Hadhani' 'Yuhadhini' with one meaning. It is said: The sun 'Gharabat' (set) 'Ghuruban', and 'Ghabat' (disappeared) 'Ghuyuban' and 'Ghayban' and 'Maghiban', and 'Wajabat' (fell) 'Wujuban', and 'Abat' (returned) 'Iyaban', and 'Waqabat' (entered) 'Wuquban', and 'Qanabat' 'Qunuban', and 'Alqat yadan fi ka'ir' (Cast a hand in a hole/sunset). All that is with one meaning. And it is said: The star 'Afala' (set) 'Ya'fulu' and 'Ya'filu' 'Aflan' and 'Ufulan'. And 'Gharaba', and 'Ightamasa' (dipped), and 'Khafaqa' (dropped). If the sun approaches setting and has not yet set, it is said: 'Zabbat' and 'Azabbat' and 'Tadayyafat' and 'Malat' and 'Janahat' and 'Tafelat'. Al-Akhfash and Al-Zajjaj informed us, they said Al-Mubarrad informed us, saying: It was told to us from more than one source with disconnected wordings and agreeing meanings, some adding to others, that when the Prophet (PBUH) died, Al-Abbas, Ali, and Al-Fadl undertook his washing. Ali said: 'I did not see his mouth frequenting the change that frequents the dead.' When he finished washing him, Ali uncovered the sheet from his face then said: 'May my father and mother be your ransom, you were good alive and good dead. By your death, what was not cut off by the death of anyone else of Prophets and Prophethood has been cut off. You were specific until you became a consoler for [the loss of] anyone else, and you were general until the calamity regarding you became equal [for all]. Were it not that you commanded patience and forbade panic, we would have exhausted the tears (shu'un) over you. But what is inevitable is grief and turning away (?), allies, and they are the disease of the term. And little, by Allah, for you. May my father and mother be your ransom, remember us with your Lord and make us of your concern.' Then he glanced a mote, so he cast it out with his tongue and returned the sheet over his face. Abu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Shu'un': Tears, singular 'Sha'n'. It is said they are the ducts of tears. And it is said they are the sutures of the skull and from them is the beginning of the tear duct. Then tears were named 'Shu'un' because of that. He recites for Aws ibn Hajar: [Poem in Kamil meter] Do not grieve me with separation, for I... my tears (shu'uni) do not flow from separation. Al-Zajjaj informed us, saying Al-Mubarrad told us, saying Lut ibn Yahya ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Jundub told us from his father, saying: I entered upon Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, when Ibn Muljam struck him, to ask about him, but I did not sit with him. Because a veiled girl entered upon him, so he called Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, blessings of Allah be upon them, then said to them: 'I advise you to fear Allah, and do not seek the world even if it seeks you, and do not weep for anything of it that was kept away from you. Speak the truth, have mercy on the orphan, help the maker (or stricken), and work for the Hereafter. Be an opponent to the oppressor and a helper to the oppressed, and let not the blame of a blamer take you in [the path of] Allah.' Then he looked to Ibn al-Hanafiyyah and said: 'Did you hear what I advised them with?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'I advise you with the like, and to honor the affair of your two brothers, and do not decide a matter without them.' Then he said to them: 'And I advise you regarding him, for he is your brother and the son of your father, and you know that his father used to love him, so love him.' Al-Yazidi informed us, saying my uncle Al-Fadl ibn Muhammad informed me from his father from Abu Muhammad al-Yazidi, saying: Abu al-Atahiyah suffered estrangement from Amr ibn Mas'adah, so he wrote to him: [Poem in Tawil meter] You became rich from the old affection, you became rich... and wasted an affection that was mine, and forgot. And I was, in days of weakness of powers... more kind and fulfilling than you when you became strong. I knew you in non-authority as preserving... so you closed the door of affection when you were appointed. You feigned ignorance of what you used to describe well... and died from benevolence when you lived. And from the wonder of days is that he who is loyal perished... and whom I used to tend for him, while you remained. Your richness to one who hopes for you is poverty and need... and humiliation and despair of you the day you were hoped for. Al-Yazidi informed us from his uncle from his father from his grandfather, saying: Al-Nu'man ibn al-Mundhir appointed some Bedouins over the Gate of Al-Hirah adjacent to the desert. He caught a lizard (Dabb) and sent it to Al-Nu'man and wrote to him: [Poem in Tawil meter] The workers of land-tax collected the money, and my collection... is cut-eared [lizards], yellow of flanks. They grazed the hills and the herbs until as if... a Sultan clothed them in the garments of Al-Marajil. Abu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Ruba' plural of 'Rabwah': It is what rose of the ground. It is said: 'Rabwah', 'Rubwah', and 'Rabawah'. It is narrated in some Tafsirs that the meaning of Allah Almighty's saying (And We sheltered them to a high ground (Rabwah) having level ground and flowing water) [Quran 23:50] is Damascus. 'Al-Shawakil': Plural of 'Shakilah' which is the flank. 'Thiyab al-Marajil': Striped garments made in Yemen. It is said that Al-Marajil is a place there where clothes are made, so they were attributed to it. Niftawayh recited to us for Al-Mu'ammil: [Poem in Basit meter] Do not get angry at a people you love... for anger from you does not benefit against them. And do not dispute with them a day even if they wronged... for judges, when disputed, overcome. O unjust ones against us in their judgment... and injustice is the ugliest of what is done and committed.",

    "text": "We do not flee from you to other than you when... you oppress, but to you from you is the flight. This is exactly the saying of Al-Buhturi: [Poem in Mukhalla' al-Basit meter] O oppressor of me without a crime... to you from your oppression is the escape. And this meaning is derived from the speech of Allah Almighty (So flee to Allah, indeed I am to you from Him a clear warner) [Quran 51:50]. Niftawayh recited to us for Abu al-Atahiyah: [Poem in Kamil meter] Annihilation was written upon the creation, all of it... and people are between advanced and left behind. Glory be to the Possessor of the Kingdoms! Which night... churned with the face of the morning of the Day of Standing? It is narrated instead of 'all of it' (kulluha), 'its Lord' (rabbuha). Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Naysaburi told us, saying Ali ibn Sa'id ibn Jarir al-Nasa'i told us, saying Abd al-Samad ibn Abd al-Warith told us from Shu'bah from Abd al-Malik ibn Umar from Rib'i: That Abu Musa fainted, so his wife wept for him. He said: I am innocent to you of what the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was innocent of: of one who shaved, and screamed (*salaqa*), and tore [clothes]. Abu al-Qasim said: Shaved is from shaving the head for women over the dead. As for 'Al-Salaq': It is raising the voice in weeping and wailing. Allah Almighty said: (They assaulted you (*salaqukum*) with sharp tongues) [Quran 33:19]. Likewise 'Al-Naq'': Raising the voice in weeping and wailing. This was forbidden in the beginning of Islam, I mean weeping over the dead, then it was permitted as long as it is not excessive, exceeding the limit in screaming and wailing. Umar ibn al-Khattab said: 'There is no harm on the women of Al-Mughira that they shed their tears over Abu Sulayman as long as there is no 'Naq'' nor 'Laqlaqah'.' 'Al-Naq'' is what we mentioned. 'Al-Laqlaqah': Moving the tongue and ululating. Abu Sulayman is Khalid ibn al-Walid ibn al-Mughira. 'Al-Sallaq': With Fatha on Lam and Sin: The level ground, its plural is 'Silqan'. 'Al-Falaq': A depression between two hills, and its plural is 'Falqan'. Muhammad ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti told us, saying Abu Isma'il al-Yazidi told us, saying Affan told us from Hammam from Thabit from Anas: That Abu Bakr told them saying: I said to the Prophet (PBUH) while we were in the cave: 'If one of them looked at his feet, he would see us under his feet.' He said: 'O Abu Bakr, what is your thought of two, Allah is their third?' Niftawayh informed us, saying Isma'il ibn Muhammad al-Sami informed us, saying Rawk ibn al-Muhabbir informed me, saying I heard Shu'bah say: 'Learn Arabic, for it increases the intellect.' Ibn al-Anbari and Ibn Shuqayr told us, saying Ahmad ibn Ubayd told us: It was on the arm band of Buzurjmihr: 'If fortunes are by luck, then why the greed? And if things are not lasting, then why the joy? And if the Abode is deceptive, then why tranquility in it?' Ibn al-Anbari told us, saying Ahmad ibn Abdullah al-Harbi told us, saying Abu Abdullah al-Qurashi told us, saying: Abu al-Hasan al-Mada'ini said: Abd al-Malik sent his brother Muhammad ibn Marwan to Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr offering him safety. Mus'ab said: 'The likes of me do not return from this position except victorious or defeated.' Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Al-Sukkari informed us from Al-Ziyadi from Al-Asma'i said: Al-Ahwas ibn Muhammad used to compose amorous poetry about the women of the nobles. He was complained about to Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, so he exiled him to a village of the villages of Yemen. He said: And when he said: [Poem in Tawil meter] I circle, and were it not that I see Umm Ja'far... in your dwellings, I would not circle where I circle. And I was not a visitor, but the possessor of passion... if he does not visit, must be visiting. Umm Ja'far has prevented her kindness... and indeed I am in need of her kindness. Umm Ja'far came with a document of a right against Al-Ahwas for a debt due immediately, so she seized him and began demanding the debt mentioned in this book from him. He swore by Allah that he did not know her, nor ever saw her. She said to him: 'O wicked one, I am Umm Ja'far, so why did you mention me in your poetry when you never saw me?' Al-Yazidi informed us, saying Abu Muhammad ibn Hamdun Hizabiyah informed us, saying: Abu Nuwas recited to me for himself: [Poem in Kamil meter] I likened him to the full moon when it appeared... or the bride on the morning of the wedding. And I seek refuge for him from having... what is under her waist-wrapper of filth. Al-Yazidi informed us, saying Tha'lab informed us, saying: We were with Ibn al-A'rabi, so he recited to me the saying of Jarir: [Poem in Tawil meter] And a day like the thumb of the sandgrouse, I imagined... its forenoon, and its evenings became pleasant in the afternoon. We were provided in it with abundant game and we were not... like one whose arrows and ropes are deprived. Ibn al-A'rabi said: Better than it—and it is what Jarir took from—is the saying of the other: [Poem in Wafir meter] And a day at the house of Abu Nu'aym... short like the side-neck of the fly.",

    "text": "Abu al-Qasim said: And I say that this is the utmost in exaggeration, and a departure from the limit of correct simile. And its parallel in exaggeration in the opposite of this meaning is the saying of Abu Tammam: [Poem in Tawil meter] And a day like the length of time in the width of its like... and my longing is longer than this and that. Ibn Durayd informed us, saying Ibn Hatim al-Sijistani informed us from Abu Zayd al-Ansari, saying: 'Al-Bitriq': The strutting, self-impressed, arrogant man. They are 'Al-Batariqah' and 'Al-Batariq'. It has no verb and is not used for women. 'Al-Humam': The master man possessing courage and generosity. It has no verb and is not used for women. 'Al-Jahjah': The master, polite man. It has no verb and is not used for women. Al-Yazidi recited to us, saying my uncle recited to me: [Poem in Rajaz meter] Do you not see me weak of the eyes... dark of the cheek and the cheeks? Rough of the shirt, hard of the sandals... Indeed, a man is by the two small things (Asgharayn). Abu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Asgharan': The heart and the tongue. From it is the saying of Damrah ibn Damrah. He used to raid the garrisons of Al-Nu'man and diminish his extremities. He sought him but he exhausted and distressed him, so he offered him a hundred camels and safety. When he entered upon him, he scorned him because he was small and unsightly. Al-Nu'man said: \"That you hear of Al-Mu'aydi is better than seeing him.\" He was the first to say it, so it became a proverb. Damrah said to him: \"Gently, may you refuse the curse! For a man is by his two smallest things: his tongue and his heart; if he speaks with clarity, and if he fights with a heart.\" So he was impressed by him and gave him charge of his gate. Al-Zajjaj recited to us, saying Al-Mubarrad recited to me, saying Al-Akhfash recited to me two verses mentioned by Sibawayh in his book by some Bedouins, and they are: [Rajaz] Indeed the generous one, by your father, works... if he does not find one day upon whom to rely. Abu al-Qasim said: In this verse there are five aspects. One: The school of Yunus, and Al-Mubarrad used to hold it previously and mentioned it in the book \"Refutation of Sibawayh\" and chose it, then rejected it. It is that the estimation is: Indeed the generous one, by your father, relies if he does not find one day anything. Then he starts and says interrogatively: Upon whom does he rely? Upon this or upon that? So 'yattakilu' is in the nominative position but he silenced it for the rhyme, so he says: Meaning he writes. The second aspect: Al-Farra used to hold it. The meaning of 'lam yajid' is: did not know. As if he said: If he did not know upon whom to rely. He said: And it was said to a woman of the Arabs: Take your pot down from the fire. She said: 'La ajidu bima unziluha' (I do not find with what to take it down), i.e., I do not know with what to take it down. The third aspect: The school of Al-Mazini, and it is what Al-Mubarrad chose lately. The meaning: He did not find and did not know. As if he said: Indeed the generous one works if he does not know upon whom to rely. The fourth aspect: That 'lam yajid' means 'lam yuktab' (was not written/destined). As if he said: If it is not written upon whom he relies. The fifth aspect: The school of Sibawayh. We delayed it due to its obscurity because some people claim he erred in it. Its estimation according to Sibawayh is that 'yajid' is connected to 'man' by 'ala', as if its estimation is: If he does not find [anyone] whom he relies upon, so the estimation is: If he does not find whom to rely upon. And 'wajadtu' is not transitive with a preposition particle, so for this they opposed him. Al-Mazini said: And his estimation is correct and good because the transitive verb may be allowed not to be transitive, so as if he intended that then it appeared to him so he made it transitive with 'ala', as the Almighty said: (It may be that some of what you seek to hasten is close behind you [radifa lakum]) [Quran 27:72]. It was only permitted to delete 'alayhi' from his saying 'in lam yajid man yattakilu alayhi' because of its mention in the beginning of the speech. Based on this, he permitted that you say: 'Mata tamrur amrur' (When you pass, I pass) and 'Ala man tanzil anzil' (Upon whom you descend, I descend), implying 'bihi' (by him) and 'alayhi' (upon him) because their mention has occurred, and the norm is that they be brought. Niftawayh recited to us: [Poem in Tawil meter] And when we settled in a place bedewed by moisture... elegant, and a garden empty of blossoms. The beauty of the place and its goodness counted for us... desires, so we wished, and you were the wishes. And he recited to us also similar to it: [Poem in Munsarih meter] Allah is witness for me in that, and... the people of chastity and piety may witness. I was never in a gathering I was pleased with... except I wished you were with me. Niftawayh informed us, saying Tha'lab informed us, saying Salamah informed us from Al-Farra who said: It is said for the kid (goat): This is the 'Jady', and 'Al-'At'at', and 'Al-'Ath'ath', and 'Al-Amarr'. He said: And 'Al-Hanan': Awe. And 'Al-Hanan': Giving. And 'Al-Hanan': Provision. And 'Al-Hanan': Mercy. And he recites for Imru' al-Qays: [Poem in Wafir meter] And Banu Shamaja ibn Jarm grant it... their goats, Your mercy ('Hananaka'), O Possessor of Mercy ('Al-Hanan'). Ibn Durayd recited to us, saying Abd al-Rahman recited to us from his uncle: [Poem in Tawil meter] And Nasr ibn Dahman, a hundred ('hunaydah') he suffered... and fifty years, then he straightened and made a sound ('insata'). And the blackness of the head returned after its whiteness... and the prime of youth after it had passed.",

    "text": "And he exchanged abundant forbearance after his recklessness... but after all that, he died. Abu al-Qasim said: His saying: 'Insata' means: he stood up straight after he was bent. 'Al-Hunaydah': A hundred camels, so he borrowed it here for a hundred years. He says: He lived a hundred and fifty years. Mudrik recited to me for himself: [Poem in Raml meter] Indeed a sickness has become serious with me from play... from you with abandonment for a continuous magic. What was small yesterday forenoon became great... so what I am in today is more cunning and bitter. They promised, when they promised, to return... from doubt, so watch them and be patient. What is upon them if tears flowed in their tracks... running with pouring water? Then blood met it so they met... upon my cheek for a matter that was decreed. O Abu al-Qattan, patience, O youth... for perhaps your master will follow with victory. From a gazelle, clothed [in beauty], tender... his name in the Book (Mushaf) humans recite. Al-Akhfash recited to us, saying Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Ahwal recited to us for Al-'Attawi, and it is said rather it is for Amr ibn Abd al-Malik al-Warraq regarding the Fitna of the Deposed (Al-Amin): [Poem in Basit meter] What afflicted you, O Baghdad, with the evil eye... Were you not for a time the delight of the eye? Was there not in you a people whom you were their dwelling... and their proximity was an adornment of adornment? I entrust to Allah a people whom I did not mention... except the water of the eye glistened from my eye. They were, so time tore them and split them... and time splits what is between two groups. He said: And Tha'lab recited to me regarding this: [Poem in Munsarih meter] I dispraise Baghdad and residing in it... after an experience and testing. There is not with their kings for a seeker... relief nor an opening for the distressed. The seeker of gifts with them needs... three [things] after approach. The treasures of Qarun to be his... and the life of Noah and the patience of Job. 'Al-Mukhtabit': The one who asks for what you have without acquaintance or cause. And it is permissible in 'Kunuz Qarun' (Treasures of Qarun) and what follows it to be nominative or genitive. Whoever made it nominative made it a predicate of an implied inchoative, as if he said: They are the treasures of Qarun. And whoever made it genitive made it a substitute for the 'Three'. Some experienced people who came to Baghdad and found it unhealthy recited to me: [Poem in Tawil meter] I see the countryside approaching every day and night... and I increase from Najd and its inhabitant in distance. Indeed Baghdad is a contrary land... to me, even if its living is abundant. A land where you see souls are cheap... and it increases in stench when it rains or becomes moist. Al-Yazidi recited to us, saying my uncle recited to me from his father: [Poem in Tawil meter] O separation which agitated the bowels... when are you, may Allah cut your luck, heedless? I see you towards the loved ones, my jealousy and hers... a lover, so killing deaths met you. Al-Akhfash told us, saying Tha'lab told us, saying Al-Riyashi informed us, saying Bishr ibn Umar told us, saying Abdullah ibn Tiqah told us, saying Abu Zur'ah ibn Jabir told us from Umar ibn Ali that Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, said: O Messenger of Allah, are the guides ('Hudat') from us or from others? He said: No, rather from us. By us the religion is sealed as it was opened by us. Saved from error. By us Allah brings hearts together after enmity, just as by us He brought their sons together after the enmity of polytheism. Ali said: O Messenger of Allah, so who remains, believers or disbelievers? He said: Tempted ('Maftun') and disbeliever. Abu al-Qasim said: 'Fitna' (Temptation/Trial) is of types in the speech of the Arabs. 'Al-Fitna': Affliction. 'Al-Fitna': Testing. 'Al-Fitna': Disbelief, from His saying, Exalted is His Name (And Fitna is worse than killing) [Quran 2:191]. And 'Al-Fitna': Punishment. And 'Al-Maftun': The one burned by fire, from His saying: (The Day they are on the fire 'yuftanun' [tried/burned]) [Quran 51:13]. It is said: They are punished, and it is said: They are burned. And 'Al-Hudat' is plural of 'Hadin' (Guide). This is a plural specific to the defective [roots], and it has no parallel in the sound [roots]. Like your saying: 'Ghaz' and 'Ghuzah' (Raiders), 'Qad' and 'Qudah' (Judges), 'Ram' and 'Rumah' (Archers), 'Had' and 'Hudah'. There is nothing in the sound [roots] pluralized on 'Fu'lah'.",

    "text": "Abu al-Harith Bishr ibn Marwan ibn al-Hakam ibn Bishr ibn Abi Amr ibn al-A'la informed us in Madinat al-Salam (Baghdad) on Thursday, fourteen nights remaining of the month of Ramadan, year three hundred and twelve, in the house of Abu al-Husayn ibn Abi Abbad. He said Muhammad ibn al-Walid al-Darawi informed me, saying Abu al-Miqdam, a Sheikh from the people of Hazbah, informed me, saying some of Banu Makhzum informed me in Mecca in the year one hundred and forty. He said: When a conflict occurred between Banu Udhrah and Khuza'ah regarding a boy belonging to a woman from Khuza'ah who used to gather wood (earn) for her and return his earnings to her, a man from Banu Udhrah hit him and killed him. Udhrah carried his value (blood money) to Khuza'ah, but they refused to accept it and said: 'That will never happen until we kill the boy of 'Umrah bint Qabisah ibn Sulayk.' The matter aggravated between them until they called upon their alliances. Hashim ibn Abd Manaf feared the corruption of the Sanctuary and that its sanctity would be violated. So he called for his pulpit, the 'Mirkan', and promised the people at the well of Banu Qusayy ibn Kilab, 'Al-Harad', which is at the meeting place of the groups. When the people gathered, he stood among them as a speaker and delivered his sermon which is called 'The Wise', singling out in it the two sons of Nizar to the exclusion of Qahtan, and Mudar to the exclusion of Rabi'ah, and Quraysh to the exclusion of other tribes. He said: \"O assembly of people, we are the family of Abraham, the progeny of Ishmael, the children of Al-Nadr ibn Kinanah, and the sons of Qusayy ibn Kilab, the lords of Mecca and the authority of the Sanctuary. Ours is the peak of honor, the core of lineage, the mine of glory, and the utmost limit of might. We are the mountains of the earth, the pillars of truth, and the masters of nations. For everyone in every alliance, his support is obligatory, and answering his call, not driving towards disobedience of a clan or severing of a womb. I have gathered you for fear that haste, bad opinion, and ignorance of knowledge might lead you to 'Hass al-Qimmah' (shaving the top/eradicating leaders) and 'Jard al-Taba'ud' (stripping of distance/estrangement). So every man among you loads a saddle upon his brother, uprooting with it his tall branches and summoning with it the flow of war. I swear, if the 'Jurrah al-Khulub' (deceptive draught?) flows before the cauterization of the splinter, the 'Hammah' (venom/fever) will surely rise over the depth, and the 'Shaml al-Sahiq' (gathering of the distant) will surely disdain until the 'Qadhif al-Kabid' (liver-thrower) is deterred, or the old waterskins hang the splinters of the feathered [arrows?]... their notches, and the chimneys empty the main part of the smoke, and the merged waists reveal the guaranteed deposited of themselves. If that happens, the dream (prudence) of the polite will stray, the opinion of the correct one will go lost, the hole of the 'Sabubah' (bucket?) will widen, the draining of the bucket will diminish, and the welding of the smith will connect. And it will be said: The road has narrowed, so advance. There the commanders will overturn their command, and the stone will accept its crushing, and the arrow will own its aim, and every man will dig up what he buried. O Banu Khuza'ah, the sons of your father carried to you the value of a slave whom death struck by the hand of mistake, so it agreed with his term. If it was from an ambush of a seeker and a seeking of a pursuer, it would be intentional. Or have you refused accepting what is the Sunnah (custom) of the Arabs to enlarge the fires of death? So be the head of the Arabs whose sons call out, while I have judged accepting his value, and upon Banu Udhrah to pay that to you. Whoever success makes him quarrelsome and leaves what his heart judged, then I am an ally against him, and a reinforcement for Udhrah against him, until the travelers carry it and the sunken-eyed camels trot with it to the judges of the Arabs, so they become proverbs. O people, forbearance is honor, patience is victory, generosity is sovereignty, kindness is a treasure, war is deception, victory is a turn (of fortune), days are changing, and lineages—one is attributed to his deed and taken by his work. So consult forbearance, it will accomplish the awkward word for you. Leave meddling, fools will avoid you. Honor the sitter, your club will be populated. Stick to noble morals, for they are elevation. And beware of base morals, for they lower the noble and demolish glory. Behold, fear of the unintelligible (foreigner/silent?) has kept hearts without a watering place for the ninety(?). 'Shakim al-Shawa' (biting of extremities?) is dangerous, and his mouth knocks the training, and his neck shrinks from the pulling of the rope. So his compacted [hoof] pierced the crushed stones of the rugged grounds due to the distance of the night journey. So he made his rider go on foot, and his curve... a ride that made his family thirsty... the slipping of the rope of the 'Sabubah' due to leaving the tightening of the knot of the 'Karab' (rope). So it did not escape except with a taste of the one with raised corners of the mouth (camel?). Behold, the time of restraining the ignorant is easier than his crime. And the head of the clan bears its weight. The station of the wise is his rage for whom he benefited. And I love repairing the rift and gathering the division.\" Then he fell silent. Banu Udhrah and Banu Khuza'ah said: 'We are pleased with your judgment, O Abu Nadlah.' And the people departed in reconciliation. Abu al-Qasim said: This man did not dictate to us any of the strange vocabulary of this report, nor did we ask him about it. I also reckon that genealogists say that Abu Amr did not leave offspring. And Allah knows best how that was, but we say regarding what this report contained according to what we know.",

    "text": "As for his saying: \"He used to gather wood (yahtubu) for her,\" 'Al-Hatab' means earning. It is said: So-and-so gathered wood for his family, i.e., earned for them. 'Al-Hatib', 'Al-Jarim', 'Al-Kasib', and 'Al-Jarih' are the same, due to the Arabs' saying: \"So-and-so is the crime ('Jarimah' - earner) of his family,\" i.e., their earner. I earned the money ('Kasabtu'), and Zayd earned the money, without Alif. It has been narrated in an anomalous dialect 'Aksabtuhu' (I made him earn), but it is not good. 'Al-Sulayk' is the diminutive of 'Al-Silk', which is the chick of the sandgrouse, and the female is 'Silkah'. The 'Jarur' well seems to be the deep-bottomed one, derived from 'Al-Ijtiran' (drawing out?), as if he distances the place of pulling its rope. 'Al' (Family) of a man: his followers, his people, and his partisans. From it is His Almighty's saying (Enter the family of Pharaoh) [Quran 40:46], meaning his followers and people. 'Al-Al' can also be 'Al-Ahl' (family/people). You say: People of the village. In the diminutive of 'Ahl' is 'Uhayl'. It is as if the Hamza in it is substituted for the Ha, then substituted with Alif due to the meeting of two Hamzas in one word, as was done in 'Adam' and 'Akhar'. This indicates that the origin of 'Al' is 'Ahl'; the Ha was changed to Hamza, and it was applied to the meaning we mentioned. The parallel of the diminutive of 'Al' being 'Uhayl' is returning to the origin. Even if it were a different meaning, like the saying of Sibawayh regarding the diminutive of 'Mudh' if one is named by it: 'Munaydh'. He said because the origin in it is 'Mundhu', so the Nun was deleted from it when it was made a noun because 'Mundhu' according to him is a genitive particle, which is the school of most Arabs. And 'Mudh' is a noun for time, what follows it is raised by inchoative, so a separation was made between them for that. So if he transfers it from this position, he says in its diminutive 'Munaydh' because the diminutive is not on less than three letters. If a woman is named by it: 'Munaydhah', just as you say in the diminutive of Hind: 'Hunaydah'. Ibrahim is a foreign name. Grammarians have two opinions on its weight. Some said in its diminutive 'Ubayyirah', and 'Ubayyiriyyah' in compensation. If pluralized as a broken plural, he said 'Abarih'. Some said: The Hamza in it is extra, except that Hamza is not added at the beginning in what exceeds three letters, but it came in the beginning of this added anomalously. So its estimation according to him is 'If'alil', so he says in its diminutive 'Burayhim' and in the plural 'Barahimah'. Likewise the saying in Isma'il. It is said in its diminutive according to this second school: 'Sumay'il' in diminutive, and 'Sama'ilah' in plural. 'Al-Nadr': Gold. 'Al-Nudar' also. Likewise 'Al-Nudar' is a type of wood. 'Al-Kinanah': The quiver, and its plural is 'Kana'in'. Among the proverbs of the Arabs: \"Before shooting, the quivers are filled.\" 'Qusayy': 'Fa'il' form from 'Al-Qasw', it is said: A 'Qaswa' camel, i.e., cut-eared. It is not said a camel is 'Aqsa'. It is possible its derivation is from 'Al-Iqsa', which is distancing, except that that is more correct in analogy and more consistent. 'Arbab': Plural of 'Rabb'. 'Al-Rabb': The owner of the thing. 'Al-Rabb': The reformer. 'Al-Rabb': The Master. Regarding the derivation of Mecca, there are two opinions. Some said: It is from your saying 'Imtakka' the foal what is in the udder of the she-camel of milk: if he drank it all. As if it attracts people to it from all horizons. Others said its origin is 'Bakkah' and the Mim is substituted for Ba, just as it is said 'Samada' his head and 'Sabada' it if he eradicated his hair. It was named that because it 'Tabukku' (crushes/breaks) the necks of tyrants, i.e., breaks them. Some said: It was named that because people 'Yatabakkun' (crowd) in it. 'Lubab' of a thing: Its pure part, and likewise its 'Lubb' (core). 'Al-Hasab': Generosity and honor. Linguists said: The derivation of 'Hasab' is from 'Hisab' (counting), from your saying 'Hasabtu' the thing if you counted it. So it is like the one who counts for himself feats and good deeds or counts noble fathers. 'Al-Ma'din': The place of residence, from your saying 'Adana' in the place: if he stayed in it. From it (Gardens of 'Adn') i.e., Gardens of residence. Thus he narrated it to us with Fatha. Every verb on the pattern 'Fa'ala Yaf'ilu' like 'Daraba Yadribu' and 'Nasaba Yansibu', the verbal noun/place/time from it is on 'Maf'il' with Kasra on the 'Ayn, like your saying: 'Darabtu Darban' and 'Madriban' if you intended the source (Masdar). 'Al-Madrib': The place where striking occurs. Likewise the time is built on 'Maf'il', like the Arabs' saying \"The she-camel came at her 'Madrib'\", i.e., at the time of her covering. As for the saying of Ziyad al-A'jam: [Poem in Tawil meter] The satirists did not leave for me, if I satirized him... a healthy place (*Masahhan*) I see in the skin of Al-Farazdaq. He intended a healthy/sound place. The source is 'Masahh' with Fatha as I mentioned. Whatever is 'Fa'ila Yaf'alu' like 'Alima Ya'lamu', and 'Shariba Yashrabu', or on 'Fa'ala Yaf'ulu' like 'Qatala Yaqtulu', the time and place and source from it are on 'Maf'al' all with open 'Ayn, like your saying: 'Al-Madhhab', 'Al-Mashrab', and 'Al-Ma'lam'. It is said 'Adana' in the place 'Ya'dinu' with Kasra in the present tense. So 'Al-Ma'din' according to this dialect must be with Kasra on Dal. And it is said 'Ya'dunu' with Damma. So 'Al-Ma'dan' from this dialect is with open Dal. Understand this, for both dialects have come in it. We consulted this Sheikh who dictated the report to us about it, but he refused to say anything but 'Ma'dana' with Fatha. He said: And that is how I heard it. And he was also eloquent. 'Al-Hilf': The ally. The Arabs in the Jahiliyyah used to ally, the tribe with those who were for some of them, that their hand be one. So they would fulfill that and not forsake each other, and they saw it as a religion they followed.",

    "text": "'Al-'Uquq': Cutting off parents or relatives. Its origin is from 'Al-'Aqq' which is splitting. It is said regarding his garment 'Aqq', and in his waterskin 'Aqq', i.e., split. 'Al-'Aqiqah': What remains of the ray of lightning in the clouds if it splits from it. From it the 'Ayyuq' stars were named 'Aqa'iq'. 'Al-'Aqiqah' also: The hair with which the newborn is born on his head. It is said 'Aqqa' regarding the newborn: if he shaves that hair and gives charity for it with something or a sheep is slaughtered and the like. In the Hadith, the Prophet (PBUH) performed 'Aqiqa' for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn and gave charity of the weight of their hair in silver. As for his saying: \"That haste leads you to 'Hass al-Qimmah' (shaving the top)\": From their saying a man is 'Ahass': if he has little hair. 'Al-Hasas': Loss of hair. 'Al-Qimmah': The top of the head. This is a metaphor, as if he intended the eradication of the leaders and those by whom their affair stands. 'Al-Qimmah' is called 'Al-Sha'fah', plural 'Al-Sha'afat'. Likewise, the tops of everything like a mountain and such are called 'Sha'afat'. Al-Ajjaj said: [Split Rajaz] Penetrating into the earth except for peaks (*Sha'afa*). As for 'Al-Amam', it is the stature, the stature of a human. The poet said: [Poem in Mutaqarib meter] Indeed the noble Mu'awiyahs are beautiful... of faces, tall of statures (*Amam*). His saying: \"And stripping the forearm (*Jard al-Sa'id*)\": The Arabs say \"So-and-so strikes at the soul of So-and-so and breaks ('yafuttu') his forearm,\" meaning by forearm the clan and people. 'Al-Jard': Scraping and peeling. From it is said: The man was stripped ('tajarrada') of his clothes. A woman beautiful of the stripped part ('Al-Mujarrad'). The stripped is from that. 'Al-Dabnah': Rancor. Like it is 'Al-Hasikah', 'Al-Dhaghinah', and 'Al-Wahar'. 'Al-Ijtithath': Cutting a thing from its root and uprooting it. From it is the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic (Uprooted from above the earth) [Quran 14:26]. 'Al-Basiqat': The tall ones. It is said: Tall palm trees (*basiqat*) from that.

From it is said: I cut off ('hasamtu') the material/source of this matter. 'Al-Jammah': Gathering of water in a settlement or well or other. 'Al-'Umq': Depth of the well and the like, which is its extension downwards. This is but a metaphor he struck for the rising of evil and its dominance. His saying: \"And the 'Shaml al-Sahiq' (gathering of the distant) will surely disdain ('la-yata'affanna')\": He means they will gather upon the vile, contemptible matter to which the situation has reached extremities, and war making people destitute and disrupting their conditions. 'Al-Ta'aththuf': Gathering upon a thing and surrounding it from its sides, derived from 'Al-Athafi' (stones of the pot). Al-Nabigha said: [Poem in Basit meter] Do not cast me at a corner that has no competencies... and let not enemies surround you ('la ta'thafannaka') with support. 'Al-Samal': The worn-out garment. It is said 'Samala' the garment and 'Asmala' so it is 'Samal': If it became worn out. Like it is 'Nahja' and 'Anhaj', and 'Majja' and 'Amajja'. 'Akhlaqa' (became worn) 'Ikhlaqan' so it is 'Mukhliq'. And 'Khaliqa' 'Khuluqan' so it is 'Khaliq', and it is the lesser of the two dialects. It is said: A garment 'Khalaq' and 'Dir's' and 'Dir'is' and 'Daris' with the same meaning. Like it is 'Al-Hasif'. And 'Al-Ma'waz', plural 'Ma'awiz'. Al-Shammakh said: [Poem in Tawil meter] When the dews fell, they were protected and lined... with silk, and 'Ma'awiz' (worn garments) were not wrapped over them. Describing a bow he protects from dew with luxurious cloths not with worn-out ones. If the garment is torn with no worn-out part left, it is said a garment 'Munaq' and 'Samatit' and 'Ra'ahil' and 'Muraddam'. From it is the saying of Antarah: [Poem in Kamil meter] Did the poets leave any 'Mutaraddam' (place to be patched)... He says: Did they leave a facet for speech they did not speak in. His saying: \"Until the 'Qadhif al-Kabid' (liver-thrower) is deterred\": He says: Until it returns to where it exited from, reversed. From their saying: The arrow 'Irtada'a' if it returned and did not proceed on its course. And the man 'Irtada'a' (was deterred) from the ugly act. 'Al-Shinan': Plural of 'Shannah' which is the old waterskin. 'Al-Shazaya': Plural of 'Shaziyyah' (splinter). 'Al-Muqadhdhadhah afwaquha': meaning arrows. There is no meaning for the attachment of 'Al-Shinan' (waterskins) to arrows unless it is a metaphor for the existence of what cannot exist and its impossibility, or for the existence of strange things, if he intended by 'Al-Shinan' other than what we mentioned whose meaning is not clear to us. His saying: \"And the chimneys empty the main part of the smoke\": The thirst and the husk/scum (?). It is said: Between them is a truce on 'Dakhan' (smoke/grudge): If it is not pure of heart. 'Al-Dakhan': From 'Al-Dukhan' (smoke). 'Al-Ifragh' here: Emptying ('Istifragh'). It is said: So-and-so 'afragha' what was in his vessel, meaning emptied it. And I connected it gathered from the void. 'Mudmajat al-Khawasir': What the waists were folded upon, meaning what they concealed of cheating and enmity and other than that. From it is said: So-and-so is 'Mudmaj al-Khalq': i.e., folded of creation, wrapped. The Arabs describe the wrapped physique with 'Idmaj' and 'Idraj' as Ru'ba said describing a wild ass: [Rajaz] Round-eyed, compacted ('admaj') like the compacting of the rope ('Talq'). 'Al-Arib': The intelligent. 'Al-Arab': Intellect, and likewise 'Al-Hija' and 'Al-Nuha' and 'Al-Hawl'. As for his saying: \"And the cut ('fary') of the 'Sabubah' widened\": 'Al-Fary': The split, which is cutting. It is said: 'Faraytu' the leather if you cut it for repair. And 'Afraytuhu': If you cut it for spoiling.",

    "text": "'Al-Sabubah': The bucket. Likewise 'Al-Maqriyyah', and it is an adjective for it as if it is an object (maf'ulah) from 'qaraytu'. Likewise 'Al-Dhanub' which is the huge bucket. And 'Al-Gharb' is like it. And 'Al-Sajil' and 'Al-Sajilah'. If the bucket is small, it is 'Kat'ah' and 'Walighah'. He only intended by his saying: \"The cut of the 'Sabubah' widened\" the like of their saying: \"The hole widened on the patcher.\" His saying: \"And the 'Washal' (trickle) of the draining of the 'Gharb' (large bucket)\": He says: The water of the large bucket became little because it does not encounter what fills it. He means the scarcity of good and its depletion. 'Al-Washal': A remnant of water in a pond, little. Like it is 'Al-Thamad'. It is said for it: The little 'Da'ath'.

Al-Lihyani narrated that it is said in its plural 'Furtan'. It is said: Water 'Masus' if it is growing in the [plants?] in their bodies. If it is salty, it is said: Water 'Milh', and 'Zu'aq', and 'Fuqa'', and 'Ujaj', and 'Huraq'. He recites: [Rajaz] Your sea is sweet water, how undutiful/salty ('a'aqqahu')... is your Lord, and the deprived is he who is not given drink. He means: 'ma afqahu' (how poor it is), so he inverted it. If the well is narrow at the head, it is called: 'Sukk'. If it is wide at the head, it is called 'Jilwakh'. If it is atop a hill, it is called 'Jamjamah'. 'Al-Zabar' and 'Al-Dars': The lining of the well. It is said: A well 'Madrusah' and 'Mazburah'. As for his saying: \"And the welding of the 'Qayn' (smith) connected\": 'Al-Qayn': The blacksmith. Some linguists claim that the Arabs call every craftsman a 'Qayn'. What is agreed upon with no dispute is that they call every cobbler an 'Iskaf'. Al-Shammakh said: [Poem in Sari' meter] Nothing remained except a belt and extremities... and two thin cloths and a delicate shirt. And two branches of Mays wood shaped by an Iskaf. 'Al-Qaynah': The slave girl, whether a singer or not. 'Al-Muqayyinah': The female hairstylist/comber. The Arabs say: The woman 'Qanat' (adorned) the girl 'Qaynan' if she adorned her.

'Al-Khus': Plural of 'Akhwas' and 'Khawsa'', which is the sunken-eyed among camels. 'Al-Haws' with undotted Ha: Narrowness of the back of the eye. It is said a man 'Ahwas' and a woman 'Hawsa''.

    "text": "Miserable is the standing of the Sheikh, return the rope, return... either on a 'Qa'w' (bucket?) or he sits back. Abu Zayd said: As for the front of the hand of spears, I do not weep for you except for the bucket and the rope ('Maras'). 'Al-Karab': To tie a rope after the first rope; if the first breaks, the 'Karab' holds the bucket. So the first is 'Al-'Inaj', and the second is 'Al-Karab'. Al-Hutay'ah said: [Poem in Basit meter] A people who, when they tie a knot for their neighbor... tighten the 'Inaj' and tighten above it the 'Karab'. Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Bishr ibn Umar told us from Ahmad ibn Yahya, saying Al-Abbas ibn al-Faraj told us, saying Bishr ibn Umar ibn Abdullah ibn Tiqah told us from Abu Zur'ah Amr ibn Jabir from Abdullah ibn Umar [that] the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: 'The Hour will not be established until the Corner (Rukn) and the Maqam are lifted.' Abu Abdullah al-Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Razi told us from Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz from Abu Ubayd al-Qasim ibn Sallam, saying Ibn Abi Za'idah told us from Mujalid ibn Sa'id from Al-Sha'bi that Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, judged regarding the Pincher ('Qarisah'), the Jumper ('Qamisah'), and the Breaker ('Waqisah') with the blood money in thirds. Ibn Abi Za'idah said: The explanation of that is that three girls gathered playing. One of them rode the other, so the third pinched the ridden one, so she jumped, and the rider fell and broke her neck ('wuqisat') and died. So he placed upon the Pincher one-third of the blood money, and upon the Jumper the second third, and voided the third third because it is the share of the rider, because she helped against herself by her riding. Abu al-Qasim said: The origin of 'Waqs' is breaking/crushing. Everything you crushed you have 'waqastahu'. The way was to say 'Mawqusah' because it is said 'Wuqisat' so she is 'Mawqusah', but it came with the wording of the subject (active participle) with the meaning of the object (passive), just as it is said 'Ma' dafiq' (gushing water) meaning 'madfuq' (gushed), and ' 'Ishah radiyah' (content life) meaning 'mardiyyah' (contented with). Abdullah ibn Malik informed us, saying Al-Zubayr informed us, saying Mus'ab ibn Uthman informed me from his father Ja'far ibn al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, saying: When it was the Day of the Camel, Ali ibn Abi Talib called out to Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam. He went out to him. He said to him: 'O Abu Abdullah, for whom leaving us was lawful, fighting us is forbidden for you.' He said: 'Do you wish that I turn away from you?' He said: 'And why would I not wish that, when you are the Sword of the Messenger of Allah, and the Disciple of the Messenger of Allah, and the in-law of the Messenger of Allah, and the cousin of the Messenger of Allah, and the cousin of the Messenger of Allah?' So he turned away from him. His son Abdullah confronted him and said: 'What called you [to this], father?' He informed him of the news. He said: 'Nay, by Allah, Ibn Abi Talib knew you, knowing that you regarding this matter possess it more than him by the rein of your horse. And were it not for your error, lest people say Ibn Abi Talib made him cowardly, they would surely say he deceived him.' Al-Zubayr said: 'Let whoever wishes say whatever he wishes to say. By Allah, I will never buy my deed with anything. And the world to me is less significant than the excretion of a beetle ('sayhah sahsahah').' And he turned back. Abu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Dayh': Milk with much water mixed in it so it spoils. 'Al-Sahsahah': From 'Al-Sahh' which is pouring. As if he said: The world is lighter to me than a mixture spoiled by water and poured out because there is no benefit in it. Al-Ma'nawi informed us, saying Ishaq ibn Isma'il al-Asbahani told me from Abu al-Qasim Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd al-Karim al-Qurashi from Sa'id ibn Ufayr from Alwan ibn Dawood, saying: Umar ibn al-Khattab went out one night and heard a woman saying from a house: [Poem in Basit meter] Is there a way to wine so I may drink it... or is there a way to Nasr ibn Hajjaj? A woman with her said: 'Who is Nasr ibn Hajjaj?' She said: 'Yes, I wished that he was in a night of the nights of autumn, and the longest night of the nights of winter. And no one else is with him.' Umar summoned her and struck her with the whip a few strikes, then asked about her, but was told nothing but good about her. When it was the next day, he sent for Nasr ibn Hajjaj. He was brought, and he had a head of hair. He said: 'He is exemplified by you and sung about.' He ordered his hair, so it was shaved. Then he went to him in the evening, and saw him in the shaven state more beautiful than with hair. He said to him: 'Do not live with me in a town; choose whichever lands you wish.' The woman wrote to Umar: [Poem in Basit meter] Say to the Imam whose rages are feared... What do I have to do with wine or Nasr ibn Hajjaj? I only sang to Abu Hafs [Umar] with other than them... drinking milk and a glance short, languid. Do not make suspicion a truth or be certain of it... Indeed the way is the way of the fearful, the hopeful. Indeed passion, piety bridled it so trained it... until it acknowledged bridling and saddling. So Umar sent to her: 'Nothing but good has reached us about you.' Nasr ibn Hajjaj wrote to him: [Poem in Tawil meter] Just because Al-Dhalfa' sang one day with a wish... and some of the talk of women is passion. You thought of me the matter after which there is no... remaining, while I have no speech in the assembly. So I become exiled without suspicion... while I had a standing in the two Meccas.",

    "text": "And prevented me from what you think, piety... and fathers of truth, past, noble. And prevents her from her wishes, worship... and a state she has among her people and fasting. And these are our two states, so are you returning... while a hump and a camel's hump have been cut from us? So he sent to him: 'No return, so depart to Basra.' He stayed with a man from his people called Mujashi' ibn Mas'ud, who had a wife called Khadra' of Banu Sulaym. She was of the most beautiful women, and she was the first to wear transparent clothes (*Shufuf*). While they were eating dinner one night, Nasr wrote for her on the ground—and the woman could read and write—: \"I love you a love that if it were above you it would shade you, and if it were beneath you it would carry you.\" The woman said: \"And I, by Allah.\" The Sheikh said to her: \"What is this?\" She said: \"He said to me: How good is the milk of your she-camel? So I said: And I [think so], by Allah.\" The Sheikh said: \"What is this like this?\" Then he overturned the bowl on the place he saw him writing in, and called for a teacher at the door of his house. He said: \"Read this.\" He said: It is \"I love you a love that if it were above you it would shade you, and if it were beneath you it would carry you.\" The Sheikh said: \"Indeed.\" Then he turned to him and said: \"O son of my brother, if divorce is thrice, then she is divorced thrice.\" He said: \"And she is divorced if a house ever gathers me and her.\" Then he departed to Fars. Al-Yazidi informed us, saying: My uncle Abu al-Abbas al-Fadl ibn Muhammad al-Yazidi was asked about the meaning of the saying of the Prophet (PBUH): \"Every Muslim is 'Muharram' upon a Muslim.\" He said: 'Al-Muharram' in the speech of the Arabs is the one refraining/holding back. Its meaning is: The Muslim holds back from the wealth of the Muslim, his honor, and his blood. He said: And Sawwar the Judge recited to me for Miskin al-Darimi: [Poem in Tawil meter] Insults came to me from men as if they were... beetles of the night having no scorpions. They settled on my honor, so I refrained ('Ahramtu') from them... and in Allah there is a Neighbor who does not sleep, and a Seeker. He said: And my grandfather recited to me for Al-Ra'i: [Poem in Kamil meter] They killed Ibn Affan the Caliph while he was refraining ('Muharram')... and he called, and I have not seen the like of him, forsaken. He said: And there are two opinions in it: That 'Al-Muharram' is the one holding back from fighting them. And the other: That he was named 'Muharram' only because he was killed in the middle of the sacred months. He said: So it was said to Al-Fadl: Do you have Jahili poetry regarding this? He said: Muhammad ibn Habib recited to me for Akhdar ibn Inad al-Mazini, and he is Jahili: [Poem in Tawil meter] My turning away and pardon has become long regarding her... who informs about him, while hearts are hearts. And my waiting for the turn of forbearance from you has become long... so that affection may return, and the return is near. And I do not see you refraining ('Muharramin') from that which... I hated, and from it are scars in the hearts. So do not feel safe from it, the repayment of your deed... so a killed one gloats or a beloved is saddened. And faults appear from us in sleep and from you... when we throw speech at each other. Abu al-Qasim said: Niftawayh recited to us, saying Tha'lab recited to us from Ibn al-A'rabi: [Poem in Tawil meter] O greet Layla, a departure has come from you... and distance, even if separation is hard, is long. And visit Layla, for a greeting... to her before the grazing of the swift camels is little. For you do not know when the white camels tuck up [to travel]... with us, whether it is destitution or enemies and distractions. Niftawayh recited to us for Al-Sayyid ibn Muhammad al-Himyari: [Poem in Tawil meter] I will take from myself for myself, perhaps it... by my taking for it from it, will be budged from a veil. Three days of the month, an oath... I fast, and sometimes I stand for the pre-dawn [prayer]. And verses of poetry, perfected, I say them... to the family of the Messenger of Allah, noble ones of the nobles. Abu Abdullah al-Kirmani said: What is counted in the creation (anatomy) of the horse from the names of birds: 'Al-Suradan': Two veins flanking the tongue. It is said: Whiteness in the back.

'Al-Kharab' (Male bustard): The blackness in the ear from its outside. It is said: The backs of the two horns. 'Al-Shamamah': The whorl in the neck. 'Al-Khattaf' (Swallow): A whorl at the kicking place. 'Al-Qatah' (Sandgrouse): The seat of the rider. 'Al-Ghurab' (Crow): The tip of the hip from the outside. 'Al-Rakhamah' (Vulture): The muscle of the leg. 'Al-Namid' (?): The tip of the 'Qanab' (tail base). In *Al-Iqd al-Farid*: 'Al-Nahid': The chick of the sandgrouse. And it is said: 'Al-Kulfah' and 'Al-Nasr' (Vulture). The inside of the hoof like the pebbles and date stones. 'Al-Saq': The leg of the horse. 'Al-Rijl': The foot of the horse. 'Al-Farashah' (Butterfly/Moth): The bones of the forehead. 'Al-Asqa'': The white forelock. 'Al-'Uqaban' (Two Eagles): The two pupils. 'Al-Harran' (?): The ridges of the ear.

Another said: 'Al-Zarq' is whiteness that does not surround the whole bone but is a splash. It is said in other sources: 'Al-Salsalah': The forelock of the horse. And 'Al-Salsalah': The ring-dove.\n\nIssue: Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad said: Sibawayh mentioned in the diminutive of 'Ahwa' (Dark/Reddish-black) doctrines; I have clarified the intent of their proponents in them, and what analogy necessitates. As for the doctrine of Isa ibn Umar, it is incorrect according to him [Sibawayh] and us, because he used to say in the diminutive of 'Ahwa': 'Ahayy' and make it tryptote (fully declinable/munsarif). The addition is in its beginning. He argues that it decreased from the weight [of the verb]. Sibawayh compelled him to make fully declinable a man named 'Yada'' or 'Yazin' because it has decreased from [the weight] 'Yaf'alu' while the addition is in its beginning. No one makes this fully declinable because the addition by which it resembled verbs is in its beginning, which is the Ya. Likewise 'Ahwa', if diminished, it is said 'Ahayy'. So making it fully declinable is not permissible because the Hamza is in its beginning. The preventer of it from being fully declinable according to us is the weight along with the addition. Do you not see that you make fully declinable a man you named 'Khubz' or 'Busr' because the addition along with the weight has ceased, even if you intend by it the meaning of 'Af'al'. Abu al-Abbas said: And the doctrine of Abu Amr ibn al-A'la, Sibawayh did not approve of it, and I follow him in that, because he used to say in the diminutive 'Ahiyy' and strengthen the Ya (Tashdid) and put it in the genitive [treat it as sound?]. Sibawayh compelled him by his analogy to say in the diminutive of 'Ata': 'Atiyy' with the genitive, and no one says this, yet it is necessary by his analogy. Abu Amr only did this because three Ya's gather, so the Tanwin goes to the last of them after assimilating the Ya of diminutive into the Waw, so he says: It is in my view from the category of 'Jawarin' and 'Qawasin'. It is not far from it in my view. It is said to him: The category of 'Jawarin' and 'Qawasin', why we called for it is that movement is impossible in it, so we made the Tanwin a compensation as we made it in 'Yawma'idhin' and in his saying: [Poem in Khafif meter] They sought our peace *wa lata awanin* (while it was not a time)... so we answered that it is not a time of survival. Since 'adhan' is not added to what explains it, then what clarifies it was deleted from it, it became necessary to build it and make the Tanwin in it a compensation for the deleted. Likewise his saying 'Yawma'idhin', it was only nunated when what clarifies it was deleted, so the Tanwin was made compensation for it. Moreover, 'Jawarin' and 'Ghawashin' have decreased from 'Fawa'il' and the addition of resemblance is not in it. Do you not see that you do not nunate 'Jawari' in the state of accusative due to its completeness? Even if you argued that three Ya's gathered, then delete and prevent declension as you do in 'Yadi'' and 'Ya'idu' if you name with either of them, according to what Sibawayh compelled you with, and it is necessary for you by your analogy. As for Yunus ibn Habib, he used to say in the diminutive of 'Ahwa': 'Ahyaw', making the Waw apparent and not assimilating because the Waw is voweled, sound in the plural in your saying 'Ahawin'. This is according to the dialect of one who says in 'Aswad': 'Usaywid'. To this was Sibawayh's doctrine, so he said: It is the analogy because he diminished based on the origin and removed the Lam of the verb due to the meeting of two sukun-letters, as it goes in 'Qadin' and 'Ramin' and in 'U'aymin', the diminutive of 'A'ma'. He argues with the like of what Abu Amr argued with and by appending it to the category of 'Jawarin' and 'Qawadin' and 'Ghawashin' because it is a Ya preceded by a Kasra and Waw. Abu al-Abbas said: This is closer to correctness and more touching to it, but what...",

    "text": "I choose and do not permit other than it is to say in the diminutive of 'Ahwa': 'Ahayya ya fata' (Ahayya, O youth), and I delete the last Ya which is the Lam, and I do not nunate because the addition in its beginning is like the addition of 'Yajidu' and 'Yada'u'. And because I have seen them, when Ya's gather, delete for lightening in the like of 'Qusayy' and 'Ghaniyy' when they attribute to them and to what is like them. I also found them deleting Lams and voweling 'Ayns in the like of 'Yad' and 'Dam' and what resembles them. So I delete, and vowel, and do not nunate.\n\nIssue: Sibawayh said in his book: \"Ma aghfalahu 'anka shay'an\" (How oblivious he is of you!), meaning leave doubt. Scholars differed regarding Sibawayh's intent in this issue and its explanation. Al-Akhfash Sa'id ibn Mas'adah said: Since I understood, I have been asking about this, and I did not find anyone who knows it in reality. Yunus used to say: Those who knew this have gone. The reason for this is that this speech ran like a proverb, and in it is deletion whose usage explicitly is rare, so those who knew it passed away. Al-Mazini said: Sibawayh's purpose in this is clear because he said \"Ma aghfalahu 'anka shay'an\", meaning leave doubt. So the installer (Nasib) of 'shay'an' is the mentioned verb which is 'aghfala', its estimation is 'aghfala 'anka ghaflatan', so he installed 'ghaflah' as a verbal noun (Masdar), then put 'shay'an' in place of the Masdar. Al-Akhfash said: This speech is not exclamation. The meaning of the speech is \"Alladhi aghfalahu 'anka shay'un\" (That which he neglected of you is a thing/little), i.e., a small matter of matters. So the predicate of the inchoative is implied, and 'Ma' is interpreted as 'Alladhi' (relative pronoun) upon the news. Then he turns to a companion of his and says to him: Leave doubt regarding what I informed you of because it is true. Al-Zajjaj used to say: I did not see in these interpretations anything befitting the issue. Its explanation in reality is according to what Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad explained to us. He said: The estimation of this speech is that there is a man who has a friend advising him, and an enemy hating him but showing him affection hypocritically and concealing enmity. His friend said to him: 'So-and-so is an enemy to you.' He said: 'He is not an enemy to me but a friend.' His friend said to him in reality: 'Far from it! The matter is not as you estimated, and he is indeed an enemy against you.' Then he turned to him and said: 'Ma aghfalahu 'anka' (How oblivious he is of you!). Meaning: Indeed your enemy is oblivious of you; if he knew you were this confident in him, he would have destroyed you. Then he said to him after that 'shay'an' (a thing/little), so he put it in accusative by an implied verb, as if he said: Think a little ('shay'an') and look a little ('shay'an'). Meaning if you thought the slightest thought and looked the slightest look, it would become clear to you that he is an enemy to you, and you would not rely on him after this. 'Shay'' is used in the place of what is very small in amount, like your saying: This Dinar increases a carat and two grains. If the amount of increase is very small, it is said: This Dinar increases 'a thing' (shay'an). Likewise, the man placed 'Al-Shay'' in his issue in place of the slightest look and thought. This speech became obscure because the usage of this implied element we mentioned is rare in their speech. This is the meaning of Sibawayh's saying following it: 'Ma aghfalahu 'anka shay'an', i.e., leave doubt. This is clear and evident, and it is the meaning of the issue in reality. It is among the implied things that are hidden from one who has not heard them explicit. Do you not see that the installer of 'shay'an' is not the one mentioned in the beginning of the speech? Sibawayh only mentioned this speech in the chapter of 'Lawla', and the implied is after this. Parallel to it is the saying of the Arabs: 'Kana dhalika hina'idhin al-ana' (That was then, now). Do you not see that 'then' is a time that has passed, and 'now' is a time you are in. The meaning of the speech is only: That was then, and listen to me now. Or do you not see that the implied element to which 'now' connects is other than the speech mentioned first? Likewise the implied in the chapter of 'Lawla', because if you said: 'Lawla Zaydun la-akramtuka' (Were it not for Zayd, I would have honored you). You only raise Zayd by inchoative, and he has no predicate in appearance. The predicate is only estimated and implied. The estimation is: Were it not for Zayd, whom I fear and respect—or something similar—I would have honored you. So the Lam is the answer, and the predicate is implied as I mentioned to you. This implication is necessary, otherwise the speech would not be straight. The implied in the speech of the Arabs is more than can be counted, except that three principles encompass it. Implied that is permitted to be explicit or implied, like your saying to a man you saw hitting a man: 'Al-Ra'sa' (The head), you mean: Hit the head. Or you saw people expecting the crescent moon then they said 'Allahu Akbar', so you said: 'Al-Hilala' (The crescent), you mean: They saw the crescent. Or you see a man in travel gear so you said: 'Makkata' (Mecca), i.e., and my Lord, meaning you want Mecca. If you wish you make this implied explicit, and if you wish you imply it. Al-Asma'i said: A man from Banu Tamim said on the Day of Jabalah when a one-eyed camel fought desperately against them: 'O Banu Tamim, a one-eyed one and possessor of a tusk?' by way of omen. He said: Then I said to some Bedouins: Do you know him in such-and-such place or 'Jadha', which is a place filled with water? He said: 'Yes, wa jadha', i.e., I knew him at Jadha. And implied that is not permitted to be explicit, which is your saying: 'A-Zaydan darabtahu?' (Is it Zayd you hit him?), 'A-Abdallah akramtahu?' (Is it Abdullah you honored him?) and the like. It is accusative by a verb that does not appear. The poet said: [Poem in Wafir meter] Is it Tha'labah, the horsemen, or Riyah... you equated Tuhayyah and the Khushab with? Likewise the saying of the other: [Poem in Munsarih meter] I have become bearing no weapon nor... owning the head of the camel if it shies.",

    "text": "And the wolf, I fear him if I am alone with him... alone, and I fear the winds and the rain. Likewise what resembles it is accusative by an implied verb that is not permitted to be explicit. Likewise their saying: 'Iyyaka wa al-sharra' (Beware of evil) and 'Iyyaka wa al-mira'a' (Beware of dispute), accusative by a verb that does not appear. Likewise his saying: [Poem in Tawil meter] Beware, beware of dispute, for it... is a call to evil and a bringer of evil. Showing the installer of 'Iyyaka' is not permitted. And 'Al-Mira'' is accusative by an implied verb other than the one that installed 'Iyyaka', and the estimation is 'Leave the dispute', and showing it is permitted. Parallels of this implied that is not permitted to be explicit are many in their speech, and it is like his saying: 'Ma aghfalahu 'anka shay'an' (How oblivious he is of you!), in their leaving the showing of the installer for 'shay'an', and their using it implied according to what I explained to you. And implied that is not permitted to be used except after the agreement of the addressee on it. That is if you come to a man to whose mind hitting Zayd or honoring him has not occurred, it is not permissible for you to say to him: 'Zaydan' (Zayd - acc.), installing it by an implied verb because there is no indication of it. So upon these three aspects is the implication of verbs in the speech of the Arabs; analogize upon it, Allah willing. Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Mahmud ibn Muhammad al-Wasiti told us in Wasit, saying Ahmad ibn Sa'id al-Zuhri told us, saying Mukram ibn Muhriz ibn al-Mahdi told us from Abd al-Rahman ibn Amr al-Khuza'i from the descendants of Umm Ma'bad at Qudayd, saying my father Muhriz ibn al-Mahdi told me from his grandfather Hakim ibn Hisham from his father Hubaysh ibn Khalid, the slain of Al-Batha' on the Day of Conquest, that the Prophet (PBUH) when he left Mecca, left it migrating, he and Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr's freed slave Amir ibn Fuhayrah, and their guide Abdullah ibn al-Arqat. They passed by the two tents of Umm Ma'bad al-Khuza'iyyah. She was a 'Barzah' (visible/mature) 'Jaldah' (strong) woman who sat in the courtyard of the dome (tent) then fed and gave drink. They asked her for meat and dates to buy from her, but they did not find anything of that with her. The people were provisionless ('Murmilin') and in a drought ('Mushtin'). He (PBUH) looked at a sheep in the corner of the tent and said: 'What is this sheep, O Umm Ma'bad?' She said: 'A sheep which fatigue has left behind the flock.' He said: 'Does it have any milk?' She said: 'It is more fatigued than that.' He said: 'Do you permit me to milk it?' She said: 'Yes, may my father and mother be your ransom, if you see any milking in it, then milk it.' So the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) called for it, wiped its udder with his hand, mentioned the name of Allah Almighty, and prayed for her regarding her sheep. It spread its legs for him, flowed [with milk], and ruminated. He called for a vessel that satisfies the group ('Yurbidu al-Raht'), and milked into it a pouring stream until the froth rose over it. Then he gave her drink until she was satisfied, and gave his companions drink until they were satisfied, and drank last of them, then drank again. Then he milked it a second time after the start until he filled the vessel, then left it with her, swore allegiance to her, and departed from her. He did not stay long until her husband Abu Ma'bad came driving lean goats, swaying from weakness, their marrow is little. When Abu Ma'bad saw [the milk], he wondered and said: 'From where did you get this, O Umm Ma'bad, while the sheep are distant and barren, and there is no milking one in the house?' She said: 'No, by Allah, except that a blessed man passed by us, whose condition was such and such.' He said: 'Describe him to me, O Umm Ma'bad.' She said: 'I saw a man of evident beauty, bright face, handsome face, not marred by a protruding belly ('Thajlah') nor disgraced by a small head ('Sa'lah'). Handsome, well-proportioned. Or she said: In the doubt of Abu Abrahah: In his eyes is intense blackness ('Da'aj'), and in his eyelashes is curve ('Ghataf'), and in his neck is length ('Sata''), and in his voice is huskiness ('Sahal'). Arched brows ('Azajj'), connected brows ('Aqran'). If he is silent, dignity is upon him, and if he speaks, he rises and brightness covers him. The most beautiful of people and most splendid from afar, and the best of them and sweetest from near. Sweet of logic, decisive ('Fasl'), neither little nor prattle. As if his logic is beads of a necklace descending from a string. Medium height, not conspicuous by length, nor does the eye despise him for shortness. A branch between two branches, so he is the freshest of the three in branch, and the best of them in stature. He has companions who surround him; if he speaks they listen to his speech, and if he commands they race to his command. Served, gathered around, neither frowning nor refuting.' Abu Ma'bad said: 'This, by Allah, is the companion of Quraysh whom we hear about in Mecca what we hear. I have intended to accompany him, and I will surely do that if I find a way to it.' A voice was heard in Mecca, high, and they did not know its owner, saying: [Poem in Tawil meter] May Allah, Lord of mankind, reward with the best of His reward... two companions who settled in the two tents of Umm Ma'bad. They descended by it with guidance, so she was guided by him... for he has succeeded who becomes the companion of Muhammad. So O family of Qusayy, what has Allah removed from you... through him of deeds that cannot be repaid and sovereignty. Let Banu Ka'b be congratulated for the place of their girl... and her seat for the believers as an observation post. Ask your sister about her sheep and her vessels... for if you ask the sheep, it will testify. He called a barren sheep, so it became pregnant... for him with pure milk, the udder of the sheep frothing. When Hassan ibn Thabit al-Ansari heard this poetry, he answered the caller with his saying: [Poem in Tawil meter] Indeed a people have failed, their Prophet departed from them... and he has succeeded who travels to him at night and morning.",

Their Lord guided them by him after error... and He guided them; whoever follows the Truth is guided. And riding camels of guidance from them descended upon the people of Yathrib... settling upon them with the greatest happiness. Let Abu Bakr be congratulated for the happiness of his grandfather (luck)... by his companionship; whoever Allah makes happy is happy. Let Banu Ka'b be congratulated for the place of their girl... and her seat for the believers as an observation post. Abu al-Qasim said: As for her saying \"Kanat barzatan jaldatan\": 'Al-Barzah': The one appearing. He says: She was past [youth] so she would appear to people and show herself, and was not like the young veiled one. It is said: A 'Jald' man and a 'Jaldah' woman, of evident 'Jald', and that is from strength. I reckon the origin of that is from 'Al-Jald' which is what is hard of the earth. And his saying: \"Al-Qawm Murmilin\": He says: Their provision has run out. Abu Zayd al-Ansari said: The man 'Armala' and 'Aqwa': His provision ran out, whether in travel or residence. And 'Al-Musintun': Those entering the 'Sanah' (year). And 'Al-Sanah': Famine and drought. In another narration according to what Al-Sa'igh informed us from Ibn Qutaybah: And the people were 'Mushtin': i.e., entering into winter, because winter is a time of hardship and distress. Ibn Qutaybah recited as a witness to this narration: [Poem in Wafir meter] If winter descends at the abode of a people... avoid the abode of their people in winter. It is said: 'Kasar' and 'Kasr' just as it is said: 'Bizr' and 'Bazr', and 'Nift' and 'Naft', and 'Jisr' and 'Jasr'. A side of it. Ibn Qutaybah said: It is the flap that follows its edge on the ground. There are two dialects in it. It is said: 'Kasar' and 'Kasr' just as it is said: 'Bizr' and 'Bazr', and 'Nift' and 'Naft', and 'Jisr' and 'Jasr'. And his saying: \"Fatafajjat 'alayhi\", he says: She opened her legs to be milked. Likewise it is said: The man 'Nafaja': If he opened between his legs to urinate. And his saying: \"Fada'a bi-ina'in yurbidu al-rahta\": He means a large vessel from which the group drinks and they become satisfied until it prevents them from rising so they lie down ('Yarbidu'). Al-Riyashi said: It is said the sun 'Arbadat': If its heat becomes intense, so the sheep and gazelle lie down ('tarbidu'), making them lie down and not rise. Al-Kisa'i said: The largest of cups is 'Al-Taban', it satisfies twenty men. After it is 'Al-Sahn', close to it. Then 'Al-'Usf', it satisfies four. Then 'Al-Qadah', it satisfies two. Then 'Al-Qabab', it satisfies one. 'Al-Raht': Between three to ten. Likewise 'Al-Nafar'. 'Al-'Usbah': Above that to forty. And his saying \"Fahalabat fihi thajjan\": i.e., pouring. It is said: 'Bakhbakhtu' the water and other things if you poured it. And his saying: \"Hatta 'alahu al-baha'\": He says: The milk rose in the vessel, which is the whiteness of its foam. 'Al-Raghwah' and 'Al-Thumal' are one. And his saying: \"Yasuqu a'nuzan 'ijafan\": i.e., lean, no marrow in them. And his saying: \"Yatasawakna\": i.e., swaying from weakness. Ka'b said: [Poem in Kamil meter] Groups, the journey took turns on them, so their body... is bare, swaying, and the heart is snatched. Some narrate it: \"Tatasawakna hazlan\", i.e., they became equal in leanness as if they shared in it. 'Al-Sha'u 'Azib': i.e., far from the home in the pasture. 'Al-Hiyal' plural of 'Ha'il', which is the one that did not conceive. As for her saying in his description (PBUH): \"Ra'aytu rajulan zahira al-wada'ah\": 'Al-Wada'ah': Good looks and beauty. 'Al-Ablaj': The shining, from their saying 'taballaja' the morning and 'inbalaja': if it exploded. She did not mean by it the separation of eyebrows because she described him as 'Aqran' (connected eyebrows). And her saying: \"Lam ya'ibhu thajlah\": 'Al-Thajal': Greatness of the belly and relaxation of its lower part. It is said: A man 'Athjal' and a woman 'Thajla'', and 'Al-Thujlah' is like it. And her saying: \"Wa lam yuzri bihi sa'lah\": 'Al-Sa'lah': Smallness of the head. 'Al-Saqal': Thinness of the flank (*Saqlah*). 'Al-Wasim': The beautiful. Likewise 'Al-Muqassam', 'Al-Qasim', 'Al-Qasamah', and 'Al-Wasamah': Beauty. 'Al-Da'aj': Intensity of the blackness of the eye. 'Al-Ashfar': The edges of the eyelids on which hair grows, and the hair is 'Al-Hudb'. She made the 'Ashfar' here the hair itself because the Arabs name a thing by the name of the thing if it adjoins it or relates to it. 'Al-Wataf': That the eyelash of the eye is long until it curves. 'Al-Sata'': Length of the neck. 'Al-Sahal': Like huskiness in the voice. 'Al-Zajaj': Length of the eyebrows and abundance of their hair. 'Al-Qaran': That their tips meet. And her saying \"La ya'lasu min tul\": She says he is not of great length so his tall counterpart despairs of out-talling him. \"Wa la taqtahimuhu 'aynun min qisar\": i.e., the eye does not despise him nor scorn him for shortness. And her saying: \"Mahshud Mahfud\": 'Al-Mahfud': The served. 'Al-Hafadah': Servants and helpers. 'Al-Mahshud': From their saying a spring 'Hashd' with people, i.e., a large gathering. And her saying: \"La 'abis wa la mughtadd\": She says: Not frowning of face. 'Al-Mughtadd': The blamed. She says: He is not blamed for anything he does. Ibn Qutaybah narrated it \"La 'abis wa la mu'tad\" with 'Ayn, and went to 'Al-'Ada'' which is injustice. 'Al-Durr': The meat of the udder. 'Al-Sarih': The pure of milk and other things.",

    "text": "Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Sa'id al-Kufi told us, saying Ahmad ibn Zakariya told us, saying Ali ibn Ubayd told us from Sulayman ibn Asir from Ibrahim from Alqamah and Masruq and Al-Aswad from Aisha, she said: The Prophet (PBUH) used to kiss me while he was fasting, but he was the most controlling of you for his need/desire (*Irb*). Abu al-Abbas ibn Khundah said: I heard Ahmad ibn Abd al-Hamid al-Harithi when a man asked him: Is it Sulayman ibn Yasir or Sulayman ibn Asir? He said: Ibn Asir with Alif. Abu al-Qasim said: 'Al-Irbah': Need. Likewise 'Al-Arab', 'Al-Irb', and 'Al-Ma'rabah'. As for 'Al-Urbah' with Damma: It is the knot. The origin of 'Sawm' (Fasting) in the speech of the Arabs: Withholding. It is said: The day fasted (*sama*) if the sun stood at noon. And the horses fasted if they stood still. Al-Nabigha said: [Poem in Basit meter] Horses fasting and horses not fasting... under the dust, and horses chewing the reins. Abu al-Qasim al-Sa'igh informed us: He said Ibn Qutaybah told us, he said it was narrated that Suwayd came to Mecca, so the Prophet (PBUH) addressed him (*tasadda lahu*) and offered him Islam. Suwayd said to him: 'Perhaps what you have is like what I have.' He said: 'And what do you have?' He said: 'The Scroll (*Majallah*) of Luqman.' His saying: 'Tasadda': Means addressed/exposed himself. 'Al-Majallah': A scroll containing some wisdom. He recites for Al-Nabigha: [Poem in Tawil meter] Their scroll (*Majallatuhum*) is the nature of God and their religion... is straight, so they hope for nothing but the outcomes. This is how some people narrate it with Jim. He said: Meaning their books which they used to read. Some narrated it \"Mahallatuhum\" (their place) with undotted Ha. He said: Meaning Jerusalem because it was their abode, meaning the city, so for that reason he said 'Mahallatuhum'. Abu Bakr Yusuf ibn Ya'qub ibn al-Bahlul al-Azraq told us, saying Humayd ibn al-Rabi' told us, saying Masinah told us from Abu al-Jahm from Al-Zuhri from Abu Salamah from Abu Huraira: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: 'Imru' al-Qays is the leader of the poets to the Fire.' Abu al-Qasim said: There is no disagreement among scholars I know of that this wording came out generally but is specific; it only refers to the poetry of the disbelievers specifically, excluding the Islamic ones. The proof of that is that the Prophet (PBUH) was praised and gave rewards for poetry, for he rewarded Ka'b ibn Zuhayr with the Burda (mantle) which is with the Caliphs today, so he sold it for twenty thousand dirhams. And Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, Al-Abbas ibn Mirdas, and Hassan ibn Thabit praised him. And the Prophet (PBUH) said to Hassan: 'Answer Quraysh regarding their poetry, and the Holy Spirit is with you.' And most of the Companions recited poetry. Al-Akhfash informed us from Al-Mubarrad that the Prophet (PBUH) said to Al-Nabigha al-Ja'di: 'Recite to me.' So he recited to him: [Poem in Tawil meter] And there is no good in forbearance if it does not have... impulses (*bawadir*) protecting its purity from being muddied. And there is no good in the ignorance of one if he does not have... a forbearing one who, when the matter is brought, issues it. So he said to him: 'You have done well, may Allah not scatter your mouth.' He said: So Al-Nabigha lived long—and he said he lived long until the time of Ibn al-Zubayr—and his mouth was like cool hail (*barad*), no tooth fell out and his gums did not recede. Al-Ma'nawi informed us, saying Al-Fadl ibn al-Hubbab al-Jumahi informed us, saying Muhammad ibn Salam informed me, saying Abu Yahya al-Dabbi told us: Dhul-Rummah met Ru'ba ibn al-Ajjaj. Dhul-Rummah said to him: 'What is the meaning of the saying of Al-Ra'i: [Poem in Tawil meter] They made [camels] with little milk kneel at night on a hidden path... a little, while Canopus had set (*aq'a*) and turned away (*'arrada*)?' Ru'ba began to fall here and there once, until he said to him: 'Woe to you, it is a land between the grassy and the barren.' He said: 'It is so.' Al-Ma'nawi informed us, saying Abu Khalifah told us, saying Salam told me, saying Muhammad ibn Aban ibn al-Ahwas ibn Muhammad the poet told me: He used to love the sister of his wife and concealed that, and composed amorous poetry about her without explicitly naming her. She married \"Matar\", so the matter overcame him and he began to say: [Poem in Wafir meter] Is it that a dove called a mate (*hadila*) at Dhat Falj... with the sunrise on a branch of a bathhouse? You remained as if your tear was a string of arranged pearls... a sword fell so the arrangement gave it up. You die of longing and joy and live... and you, with the atmosphere of your disease, are infatuated. As if you, from remembering Umm Hafs... are watered by a land where the clouds settle. She settled the slope of Uhud, and the nearest of... her dwellings is Al-Shabikah or Sanam. Peace of Allah, O Matar, be upon her... and not upon you, O Matar, be peace. So may God not forgive those who married her... their sins, even if they prayed and fasted. As if the owners of the marriage of Salma... on the morning Matar sought her, were asleep. If marriage makes a thing lawful... then her marriage to Matar is forbidden ('Haram'). If they had married none but a match... her palms would have been [for] the King, the Gallant.",

    "text": "So divorce her, for you are not a match for her... otherwise, the sharp sword will cut your parting. As for his saying: \"A-in nada hadilan\", I heard Al-Akhfash say: I heard Al-Mubarrad say: Our companions say: The pigeon 'Hadala' 'Hadilan', and 'Hadara' 'Hadiran': if it made a sound. And the camel 'Hadara', but 'Hadala' is not said. Others of our companions permit it. If it trilled, it is said 'Gharrada' 'Taghridan'. 'Taghrid' can be for humans and its origin is from birds. Some of them say: 'Al-Hadil': The male pigeon. They argue with the saying of Al-Ra'i: [Poem in Kamil meter] Like a hoopoe, the archers broke his wing... calling on the middle of the road a 'Hadil'. And 'Saq Hurr': The male of the turtledoves and pigeons. From it is the saying of Al-Tirimmah likening the archers to pigeons: [Poem in Madid meter] Between archers (*az'ar*) in a dark place... like the backs of the leg, the leg of the pigeon. As for his saying: \"Salamu Allahi ya Mataran 'alayha\" (Peace of Allah, O Matar, upon her), it is a singular vocative and he nunated it for necessity. Al-Khalil, Al-Mazini, and Sibawayh choose to nunate it in the nominative (\"Ya Matarun\") and say: When we were forced to nunate it, we nunated it according to its wording. This is what Al-Farra used to hold and choose. As for Abu Amr ibn al-A'la, Yunus, and Isa ibn Amr al-Jarmi, they recite it: \"Ya Mataran 'alayha\" with accusative and Tanwin, and say: The Tanwin returned it to its origin, and its origin is accusative. It is like a noun that is diptote (does not accept Tanwin); if the poet is forced to nunate it, he nunates it and declines it fully and returns it to its origin. The poet said: [Poem in Kamil meter] I have not seen nor do I see in my time... like girls (*ka-jawarin*) playing in the desert. Do you not see how he nunated it and put it in the genitive? The saying in my view is the saying of Al-Khalil and his companions. The summary of that: The singular proper noun in the vocative is built on Damma due to its resemblance, according to Al-Khalil and Abu Amr and their companions, to sounds; and according to others due to its occurrence in the place of the pronoun. If Tanwin attaches to it in poetic necessity, the cause for which it was built still exists, so it is nunated according to its wording (nominative), because we have seen built words that are nunated like 'Ihin' and 'Ghaqin' and similar. It is not like the diptote, because the origin of the diptote is full declension. Many Arabs do not refrain from fully declining anything in poetic necessity or otherwise, except 'Af'ala minka'. On this dialect was read \"Qawariran Qawariran min fiddah\" [Quran 76:15-16] by nunating both of them. So if it is nunated, it is returned to its origin. The singular proper noun in the vocative was never pronounced accusative nunated except in poetic necessity. This is clear and evident. Abdullah ibn Malik informed us, saying Al-Zubayr ibn Bakkar informed us from his uncle, saying: Umar ibn Abdullah ibn Abi Rabi'ah went out to Syria. Jamil met him and said: 'Recite to me some of your poetry, O Jamil.' So he recited: [Poem in Tawil meter] My two friends, in your life, have you seen... a killed one crying out of love for his killer before me? Then he said: 'Recite to me, O Abu al-Khattab.' So he recited: [Poem in Tawil meter] Have you not asked the ruins and the dwelling place... at the belly of Hulayyat, effaced, empty? Is there a messenger from three buxom girls... and a fourth completing beauty altogether? When we stood together and I greeted, faces approached... beauty guarded them from being veiled. They feigned ignorance of each other in recognition when they recognized me... and said: 'A man seeking, gone astray and humbled.' And they brought close the causes of passion to the enslaved... measuring a cubit whenever they measured a finger. So I said to the one praising them in beauty: You have only... harmed, so are you able to benefit so you benefit? Jamil shouted: 'This, by Allah, is the one from whom the amorous poetry (*Nasib*) is taken,' and he recited nothing until they parted. It is said: The poet 'Nasaba' with the woman 'Yansibu' 'Nasiban': if he mentioned her beauties in his poetry. And he attributed the man 'Yansibuhu' 'Nasaban' and 'Nisbah'. Al-Akhfash recited to us, saying Al-Mubarrad recited to us, saying Al-Attawi recited to me for himself eulogizing Ahmad ibn Abi Du'ad: [Poem in Tawil meter] The creaking of the bier is not what you hear... but it is the loins of people breaking. And the scent of musk is not the fragrance of his embalming... but it is that praise left behind. Ibn Durayd recited to us for himself: [Poem in Majzu' al-Raml meter] Is it from the sun in the evening... those veils were uncovered? Or from the moon was removed... at midnight that head-covering? Or on the sides of the neck of a gazelle... were those earrings hung? Or did fate show you what... the standing people did not see? Indeed the ruling of wide eyes... is unjust upon creation. They brought close to... passion, and passion is far-throwing. So they removed patience from me... and it was for me a companion, an ally. Oh, what a drink of sickness... mixed with dissolved poison. Fate drove it to my soul... openly while it was averse. O daughter of the Yemeni king (*Qayl*), and for Time are turns.",

    "text": "If it became shining... it has one day an eclipse. Or if it blew as a breeze... it has one day a hot wind. Let not my tolerance deceive you, for my leader is violent... Perhaps a recalcitrant one is led... sometimes, then turns away. So beware the turning away of my soul... from you, for the soul is turning away. She aimed at a lion of a thicket... between his two lairs is a roar. A doe whom guards in the... Al-Amjiyyat (?) a glitter. Perhaps the sturdy one is destroyed by the arrow while the archer is weak. And wine that I aged... after ancestors passing. The Jinn had chosen it... before, while the earth was trembling. So it is a meaning which... the subtle imagination does not encompass. And it is wide in the body... and it is slow in the cup. And it is an opposite to the darkness of the night, while the night is crouching. The lover turns his glance away from it... while he is drained (drunk). We have transgressed reason regarding it... and Allah is Kind. And a station whose arrival is unhealthy, suspected, feared. Terms [lives] wept when... deaths laughed in it. The upper spears were lowered in it... and the swords rose in it. It was clothed [in armor/dust] while the eagles... of death hover in it. When for souls in the fright... of terror there is a palpitation. Indeed my house is in the peaks of Qahtan belonging to the lofty house. And I have the high skull and the thick glory. And I have the old wealth in glory, ancient and new. Every glory the Yemenis did not mark is thin. 'Al-Sujuf': Plural of 'Sijf' which is the curtain. It is said 'Sijf' and 'Sujf'. His saying: 'Tasarra' is from your saying: I cast off ('Sarawtu') my garment if I threw it. 'Al-Mawhin': From the beginning of the night to hours of it. 'Al-Nasif': The head-covering (Khimar). 'Al-Litan': The two sides of the neck. 'Al-Shunuf' plural of 'Shanf', which is what is hung in the upper ear. 'Al-Qadhif': The distant. 'Al-Halif': The adherent. 'Al-Shawb': Mixing. From His Almighty's saying: (Then indeed they will have on top of it a mixture (*shawban*) of boiling water) [Quran 37:67]. 'Al-'Ayuf': The one hating the thing. 'Al-Qayl': The king. It is said: 'Safa' away from the thing if he turned away from it. And 'Azafat nafsi' from the thing: If it hated it. 'Al-Ghab': Plural of 'Ghabah' which is the thicket, and likewise 'Al-Khis'. 'Al-Amjiyyat': A place. 'Al-Rafif': The movement of the thing and its glitter and clarity. It is said: So-and-so's teeth 'tariffu' (glitter). 'Al-Aslaf' plural of 'Salaf'. 'Al-Khuluf': Plural of 'Khalf' or 'Khalif'. 'Al-Khalf' with open Lam is used in good and evil. As for 'Al-Khalf' with silent Lam, it is only in blame. 'Al-Wasa'': The quick one. 'Al-Qatf': Closeness of steps and their approximation. 'Al-Nazif': The drunk. 'Al-Mustawbil': The disliked. 'Al-'Awali': Plural of 'Aliyah' which is the top of the spear. His saying: \"Wa 'uqbanu al-rada fihi ta'ifu\": 'Al-Rada' is destruction. 'Ta'ifu': i.e., circling around it and disliking arriving at it. Niftawayh told us, saying Abu Ya'qub told us, saying Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad told us, saying Shayban told us from Qatadah regarding His Almighty's saying (And those who take protectors besides Him [say], \"We only worship them that they may bring us nearer (*li-yuqarribuna*) to Allah in position (*zulfa*)\") [Quran 39:3]. He said: They used to say we do not worship these gods except to intercede for us with Allah. Abu al-Qasim said: In this verse are types of questions according to the school of Arabic. Among them is to be said: Where is the predicate of \"Alladhina\" (Those who) from what you see in the context of the speech? And among them is to be said: Which Lam is this in 'yuqarribuna'? And among them is to be asked about the position of \"zulfa\" in parsing (I'rab). The estimation of the verse - and Allah knows best - is that when He said: (So worship Allah, being sincere to Him in religion... the verse), sincere religion, so He informed that the religion is what is made pure for Allah Almighty. He started informing about the disbelievers, rebuking them and alerting to their misguidance, so He said: (And those who take protectors besides Allah [say] \"We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in position\"). \"Alladhina\" is inchoative and its predicate is 'yaquluna' (they say), so He implied it because of the indication in the speech upon it, as He Almighty said: (And the angels will enter upon them from every gate, [saying] \"Peace be upon you\") [Quran 13:23-24], i.e., saying Peace. The Lam in His saying: \"li-yuqarribuna\" is the Lam of Kai (purpose), its interpretation is 'li-kay yuqarribuna', and it is not the Lam of Juhud (denial) even if 'Ma' is before it. The difference between the Lam of Juhud and the Lam of Kai is that the Lam of Juhud can be dropped, like your saying: \"Ma kana Zaydun li-yakhruja\" (Zayd was not to go out); if you said \"Ma kana Zaydun yakhruju\", it would be complete speech. And the Lam of Kai cannot be dropped. If you said in your saying: \"Qasadtuka li-tukrimani\" (I intended you so you honor me), \"Qasadtuka tukrimuni\", it would not be permissible. Likewise, it is not permissible to drop it in this verse. 'Al-Zulfa': Proximity, and it is accusative as a verbal noun (Masdar) because the meaning of 'yuqarribuna' and 'yuzlifuna' is the same. 'Al-Zulaf': in His saying (And approaches (*zulafan*) of the night) [Quran 11:114] is plural of 'Zulfah', which are hours close to each other. Al-Ajjaj said: [Rajaz] A swift camel, fatigue folded it from what it suffered... the folding of nights, hour by hour (*zulafan fa-zulfa*).",

    "text": "The sky of the crescent until it curved. Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Abbas ibn al-Faraj al-Nahwi, known as Ibn Shuqayr, informed us, saying Ahmad ibn Ubayd ibn Nasih ibn Asidah told us from his sheikhs raising it to Muhammad ibn Ishaq, who said: Amr ibn al-Jamuh ibn Zayd was a noble master, and he had taken for himself an idol of wood called Manat which he worshipped in his house. His son Mu'adh ibn Amr had pledged allegiance to the Prophet (PBUH) and wanted his father to embrace Islam, but he refused. When Mu'adh ibn Jabal and a group of the youths of his people embraced Islam, they used to gather with Mu'adh ibn Amr and come at night to Amr's idol, so they would soil it with filth and smear it with impurities. When Amr woke up, he would say: 'Woe to you, who transgressed against my god tonight?' When that happened often to him, he said: 'Indeed, by Allah, I do not know who exposes himself to you, and if I knew that, I would defend you.' Then he washed it, cleaned it, perfumed it, and hung a sword on it and said to it: 'Defend yourself if there is good in you.' When night came, his son and Mu'adh and a group with them came, tied a dead dog to it, and threw it with the sword and the dog into a well belonging to Banu Salimah filled with excrement. When Amr woke up, he began going around searching for it. When he stood over it, he saw clearly and embraced Islam, and his Islam was good. He recited saying: [Poem in Mutaqarib meter] I repent to Allah from what has passed... and I ask forgiveness of Allah from His Fire. And I praise Him for His blessings... The God of the Hatim and its curtains. So glory be to Him, the number of the sinners... and the drops of the clouds and their pouring. He guided me while I was in darkness... an ally of Manat and its stones. And He saved me after the graying of the back of the head... from the shame of that and from its disgrace. And I almost perished in darkness... so He rectified that by His decree. So praise and thanks to Him as long as I remain... a saying of shame for His warning. I hope by that, when I said it... to neighbor Allah in His House. Then he turned to his idol and recited saying: [Rajaz] Uff to your abode as a god in filth... Now we have inspected you regarding the evil of fraud. By Allah, if you were a god, you would not be... you and a dog in the middle of a well in a rope (*Qaran*). Praise be to Allah, my God, Possessor of favors... The Giver, the Provider, the Judge of the Religion. He is the One who saved me before I... become in the darkness of a grave, pledged. Abu al-Qasim said: It is said 'akhta'a' the man in his action 'yukhti'u' 'ikhta'an' so he is 'mukhti''. And 'khati'a' in his religion 'yakhta'u' 'khat'an': if he sinned, so he is 'khati'' (sinner), O this one. So his saying: \"Number of the sinners (*khati'in*)\", he means the sinful. 'Al-'Ani': The submissive, humble. From it His saying: (And faces will be humbled (*'anat*)) [Quran 20:111]. From it the captive is called 'Anin'. 'Al-Daran': Dirt. 'Al-Qaran': The rope in which two camels are tied together, and he meant it in his poetry. 'Al-Qaran': Verbal noun of 'Al-Aqran' among men, who is the one whose ends of eyebrows meet. 'Al-Qarn': A solitary mountain. 'Al-Qarn' like 'Al-'Aql'—with silent Ra—: A dispute was brought to Shurayh regarding a slave girl who had a 'Qarn' (horn-like protrusion/hernia?), owned. He said: Sit her down; if it touches the ground it is a defect, otherwise it is not a defect. Abdullah ibn Malik informed us, saying Abu Muslim al-Harrani informed us, saying I was told from Abd al-Rahman ibn Salih from Yunus ibn Bukayr from Mujalid from Al-Sha'bi who said: I entered upon Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr. He said to me: 'O Sha'bi, lift this curtain.' I lifted it, and behold, Aisha bint Talhah was there. He said: 'How do you see?' I said: 'I did not think there was anyone on earth resembling this one.' She said: 'As for me, I have not enjoyed life with him nor benefited from him ever, because I am a masculine man wanting the command to be mine, and she is a masculine woman wanting the command to be hers. So neither do I follow her, nor does she follow me.' Abu Muhammad al-Darir informed us, saying Abu Muslim al-Harrani informed us, saying it was narrated from Yunus ibn Bukayr from Muhammad ibn Ishaq from his father, saying: I saw Aisha bint Talhah reclining; if a slaughtered camel were made to kneel, it would not be seen [behind her due to her size/grandeur?]. Al-Akhfash and Niftawayh informed us from Tha'lab from Ibn al-A'rabi, saying: 'Al-Habnaqa' and 'Al-Habnaqa'ah': The arrogant fool, who is the one who sits on the tips of his toes and asks people. 'Al-Sakhal': Mixing the drink. 'Al-Sakhil': The young boy who befriends a man. 'Al-Khadil' with Kasra on Dad: Everything that does not drip; from it is said 'Shiwa' Khadil' (Moist roast): if it is moist, well-cooked. 'Al-Khadal': With Sukun on Dad: Pearls, singular 'Khadlah'. It is narrated that a woman presented her husband to Al-Hajjaj and said: Marry me upon a 'Fadlah' (surplus/favor?). It is said: 'Akmakha' the man: If he sat arrogantly. 'Al-Kaykham': From the names of greatness and authority. 'Al-Kamikh' according to the pure Bedouins is 'Al-Salamih'. It is narrated that a pure Bedouin entered a village and asked for food. They presented him bread and 'Kamikh' (pickles/condiment). He began to glance at it angrily thinking it was 'Salamih'. Some of them said to him: 'It is Kamikh.' [He said:] 'I know it is Kamikh, so which of you 'Kakhkha' (defecated) in it?'",

    "text": "Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Hamdan al-Basri and Abu Ghanim al-Ma'nawi informed us, saying Abu Khalifah al-Fadl ibn al-Hubbab informed us from Muhammad ibn Salam, saying: Suraqah al-Bariqi was a poet, witty, a visitor to kings, sweet of speech. He went out among those who went out to fight Al-Mukhtar, so he fell captive. He was brought to Al-Mukhtar. When he fell before him, he said: 'O Trustee of the Family of Muhammad. None of those in front of you captured me.' He said: 'Woe to you, then who captured you?' He said: 'I saw men on piebald horses fighting us; I do not see them now. They are the ones who captured me.' So Al-Mukhtar said to his companions: 'Indeed your enemy sees of this matter what you do not see.' Then he ordered his killing. He said: 'O Trustee of the Family of Muhammad, you know that this is not the time in which you kill me.' He said: 'So when do I kill you?' He said: 'When you conquer Damascus and demolish it stone by stone, then sit on a chair at one of its gates; there you will call me, kill me, and crucify me.' Al-Mukhtar said: 'You spoke the truth.' Then he turned to the chief of his police and said: 'Woe to you, who will let Suraqah go ('yukhriju sura') to the people?' Then he ordered the release of Suraqah. When he escaped, he recited saying—and Al-Mukhtar was nicknamed Abu Ishaq—: [Poem in Wafir meter] Inform Abu Ishaq that I... saw the piebald [horses] as pure black ones. My eye sees what they did not see... Both of us are knowledgeable about lies (*Turrahat*). I disbelieved in your revelation and made a vow... upon myself to fight you until death. As for his saying: \"tara'ayahu\" (they two saw it), he returned it to its origin. The Arabs did not use 'Yara' and 'Tara' and 'Ara' and 'Nara' except by dropping the Hamza for lightening. As for the past tense, the Hamza is affirmed. Al-Mazini used to say: The choice in my view is to narrate it \"Tarayahu\" without Hamza because the deviation (*Zihaf*) is easier than returning this to its origin. Likewise, he used to recite the saying of the other: [Poem in Tawil meter] Did you not see what I encountered while time is eras... and whoever enjoys life sees ('yar'a') and hears. With realizing the Hamza. Niftawayh told us, saying Abu Ya'qub al-Harami told us, saying Al-Husayn ibn Muhammad told us, saying Shayban told us from Qatadah regarding the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic (There was for Saba' in their dwelling a sign: two gardens on the right and on the left) [Quran 34:15] the two together. He said: They were a people whom Allah bestowed blessings upon, commanded them to obey Him, and forbade them from disobeying Him. But they turned away, i.e., associated partners in the command of Allah Mighty and Majestic. So Allah sent upon them the flood of Al-Arim. He said: Al-Arim is the valley of Saba' where floods or whatever gathered. So they proceeded to block what was between the two mountains with tar and stones and built gates upon it. They used to take from the water according to wisdom and block in its fold what was other than that. When they abandoned the command of Allah, Allah sent upon them a rat called 'Al-Khuld' (Mole/Rat). It bored into it from its bottom, so it drowned their gardens and ruined their land, and they were scattered in the lands. That was a punishment from Allah for them for their disbelief. He said: (And We dispersed them with every dispersion) [Quran 34:19]. Then He said: (And We exchanged for them, in place of their two gardens, two gardens yielding bitter fruit (*khamt*)). 'Al-Khamt': The Arak tree, and its fruit is 'Barir'. And 'Al-Athl': A tree resembling the Tamarisk (*Tarfa'*) except it is larger than it. And His saying: (and a little of Lote trees (*Sidr*)). He said: We built their land as the best land and their trees as the best trees; Allah ruined their land and made their trees the worst trees as a punishment for them for their disbelief. Abu al-Qasim said: Scholars have three opinions regarding 'Al-Arim'. Some said: 'Al-Arim': The dam break itself which burst upon them. Others said: 'Al-Arim': The dams (*Al-Musannayat*), a plural whose singular is 'Arimah' like 'Labinah' and 'Labin', and 'Nabiqah' and 'Nabiq'. This is the view of linguists, and they argued with the saying of Al-Nabigha al-Ja'di: [Poem in Munsarih meter] From Saba' the losers of Ma'rib when... they build the 'Arim' (Dam) before its flood. Al-Akhfash informed me, saying Tha'lab informed us, saying Al-Riyashi informed us, saying: I heard Abu Ubaydah Ma'mar ibn al-Muthanna mention from Abu al-Dahhak who said: I witnessed the dam break that burst in Yemen in the days of Saba', and found it like a river running in Basra. As for 'Saba'', it is hamzated and non-hamzated, except that the Arabs have two dialects in it: some make it a name of a male clan, so if they attribute to it, they make it fully declinable (Tasrifuhu). And some make it a name of a tribe, so they do not make it fully declinable. The readers have read with declension and leaving it. Likewise 'Thamud', its analogy is this exact analogy in declension and leaving declension. 'Al-Jannah' in the speech of the Arabs: The garden. As for 'Al-Juradh' (large rat) from rats, it is with Damma on the first and dotted Dhal. Likewise 'Al-Juradh' (spavin/swelling) in the legs of beasts is with dotted Dhal except it is open on the first (Fatha). Likewise 'Al-Zarad' (strangling?) with dotted Dhal only. Al-Yazidi informed me, saying my uncle Al-Fadl ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Muhammad al-Yazidi informed me",

    "text": "From Abu Muhammad ibn al-Mubarak al-Yazidi, saying: While I was circumambulating one morning at Mecca, Masin al-Zayyat met me and said to me: 'O Abu Muhammad, I am waiting for you at the Maqam, I will meet you at the Misirayn (?) when you finish circumambulation.' So I went to him and he said to me: 'O Abu Muhammad, I did not sleep last night because of something that agitated my chest, preventing me from sleeping by thinking about it. I wished only that morning would come.' I said: 'What is that?' He said: 'Is it permissible in the speech of the Arabs for a man to say: \"I want to say such and such\" for something he has already done? For that is not permissible except by a type of narration (*hikayah*) explained to you.' He said: 'So what do you say about the saying of Allah Mighty and Majestic (Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land) until he reached His saying (And We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed... the Verse) [Quran 28:4-5]. He addressed Muhammad with it while He had already done that before.' So I said to him: 'This is of the narration (*hikayah*) which I mentioned to you, because when He said (Indeed he was of the corrupters), the estimation of the speech was \"And it was of Our judgment on that day that We confer favor,\" so He narrated that to Muhammad (PBUH). As He said in the story of Yahya (And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies...) because the estimation of the speech is \"And it was of Our judgment, peace be upon him,\" so He narrated that to Muhammad, peace be upon him.' He said to me: 'May Allah reward you with good, O Abu Muhammad, for you have relieved me by what you explained, and I will benefit you as you benefited me.' Abu Muhammad said: So he told me from the Prophet (PBUH) that most of his supplication was: \"O Allah, I ask You for certainty, pardon, well-being, and the completion of blessing in the world and the Hereafter.\" Al-Ma'nawi informed us, saying Abu Khalifah informed us from Muhammad ibn Salam who said: Mayy, whom Dhul-Rummah composed poetry about, was the daughter of Talabah ibn Qays ibn Asim al-Minqari. And the mother of Dhul-Rummah was a client of the family of Qays ibn Asim. When she saw Dhul-Rummah's infatuation with her and his matter increasing, she wanted to create alienation between them, so she said on the tongue of Dhul-Rummah: [Poem in Tawil meter] Upon the face of Mayy is a trace of beauty... and under the clothes is shame if it were apparent. Have you not seen that water, its taste becomes foul... even if the color of the water in the eye is clear? So Mayy became angry at that. Dhul-Rummah kept apologizing and swearing that he did not say it. He said: 'How could that be when I have spent my life composing amorous poetry about her?' Abu al-Qasim said: And this poetry is the most resembling thing to the poetry of Dhul-Rummah; it is close to his nature, and resembling this meter and rhyme is the poetry of Dhul-Rummah. Al-Akhfash recited to us: [Poem in Tawil meter] An old woman says: 'My way is going at evening... to her door from my family and going at morning.' So I said to her: 'No, indeed my family are neighbors... to the dunes of Al-Dahna, all of them, and my wealth.' And I was not, since you saw me, in a dispute... wherein I return, O daughter of the people, to a judge. But I approached from the sides of Qasa... visiting a youth, Najdi, generous, Yemeni. From the family of Abu Musa, you see the people around him... as if they were Bustards that saw a Falcon. Struck with awe from a lion, upon him is dignity... the lions of the thicket avoid him, an avoidance. And they do not fear clumsiness from him nor is shame/hesitation... upon them, but it is an awe, what is it? Ibn Durayd informed us, saying Abu Hatim informed us, saying Al-Asma'i informed us, saying: The Arabs say \"The burdensome nakedness is better than the scandalous outfit.\" Ibn Durayd informed us, saying Abu Hatim informed us from Al-Asma'i, saying: Some people raised a petition to Al-Mansur asking him to build a mosque in their locality. He signed on it: \"Of the signs of the Hour is the abundance of mosques, so increase in your steps, you will increase in reward.\" Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Al-Mubarrad informed us, saying Al-Mazini informed us from Al-Asma'i, saying my father and others informed me: Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf said to Yahya ibn Ya'mar: \"Do I make grammatical errors ('alhanu') in my speech?\" He said: \"God forbid.\" He said: \"I resolve upon you (to tell the truth).\" He said: \"You add Alif and subtract it.\" He said: \"Catch up with Khurasan (Exile).\" When it was after that, Qutaybah ibn Muslim wrote from Khurasan: \"Indeed the enemy is at the 'Ar'arah' (peak) of the mountain, and we are at the 'Hadid' (bottom).\" Al-Hajjaj said: \"From whom?\" And he denied that this was from his speech. It was said to him: \"Yahya ibn Ya'mar.\" He said: \"This is from his dictation.\" Al-Mubarrad said: 'Al-'Ar'arah': Top of the mountain. 'Al-Hadid': Its bottom where it leads to the plain. And 'Ar'arah' of the cow: Its hump. Al-Akhfash informed us from Al-Mubarrad from Al-Riyashi, saying Adi ibn al-Mufaddal said: I came to...",

    "text": "Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz asking him to dig a well at Al-Adhbah. He said to me: 'And where is Al-Adhbah?' I said: 'At a distance of two nights from Basra.' So he had it dug for me and blamed himself (or made me ensure) that there be no water in such a place, and stipulated on me that I guide the drinker of the wayfarers. Then I greeted him on a Friday and found him preaching, and I heard him say: \"O people, you are dead, then you are resurrected, then you are held accountable. So if you are truthful, you have fallen short. And if you are liars, you have lied. O people, indeed whoever is destined a provision at the head of a mountain or bottom of a land, it will come to him, so be moderate in seeking.\" He said: So I stayed with him a month, having no concern but listening to his speech. Al-Akhfash informed us, saying Al-Mubarrad informed us, saying: The narrators transmitted that when Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr al-Siddiq died and Aisha was not present, she visited his grave and said: 'O my brother, if I had attended your death, I would not have visited your grave.' And she began to say, quoting as an example: [Poem in Tawil meter] We were like the two drinking companions of Jadhimah for an era... of time, until it was said they will never separate. So when we separated, it was as if I and Malik... for the length of gathering, did not spend a night together. Then she attended Abu Bakr while he was breathing his last. She said: 'This, by Allah, is as Hatim said: [Poem in Tawil meter] O Mawiyah, wealth does not avail the youth... when [the soul] rattles one day and the chest becomes tight with it.' Abu Bakr said to her: 'O my daughter, do not say this, but say: (And the stupor of death will come in truth) [Quran 50:19].' And this is how Abu Bakr, may Allah have mercy on him, used to read it. Al-Akhfash and Al-Zajjaj recited to us, saying Al-Mubarrad recited to us for Abu al-Atahiyah eulogizing Ali ibn Thabit, who was a brother to him. Abu al-Abbas said: Ali was a polite, devout, witty poet: [Poem in Wafir meter] Oh, who is for me with your intimacy, O my little brother... and who is for me to reveal to him what I have? The calamities of your time folded you after spreading... Likewise are its calamities, spreading and folding. If deaths spread your powers for me... I would complain to you what they did to me. There were admonitions for me in your life... and you today are more admonishing than when you were alive. Abu al-Abbas said: He took this from the saying of some non-Arabs who attended a king of theirs who died. He said: 'The king yesterday was more speaking than he is today, and he is today more admonishing than yesterday.' Abu al-Atahiyah also said regarding him: [Poem in Khafif meter] O Ali ibn Thabit, where are you... You are among the graves where you were buried. O Ali ibn Thabit, there departed from me... a companion whose loss was great the day you departed. Indeed, by my life, you narrated to me the choking of death... and you moved me for it, and became still. Abu al-Abbas said: This is also taken from the saying of some non-Arabs who attended the death of a friend of his. When he passed, voices rose weeping for him. He said: 'He moved us by his stillness.' And Abu al-Atahiyah said regarding Ali ibn Thabit also: [Poem in Majzu' al-Khafif meter] A companion I had perished... and the path which he walked. Every living thing owned... will perish along with what he owned. O Ali ibn Thabit... May Allah forgive me and you. Abdullah ibn Malik informed us, saying Muhammad ibn Abi Ubayd al-Basri informed me from Asad ibn Sa'id ibn Hunayn from his father, saying Ibn Mughni, a man from the descendants of Sa'id ibn al-As, told me, saying Ishaq ibn Sa'd ibn Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-As told me: Al-Arji, who is Abdullah ibn Umar ibn Uthman ibn Affan, used to compose amorous poetry about the wife of Muhammad ibn Hisham. Ibn Mughni said: As for Al-Hudhali Yazid ibn Abdullah, he told me that he used to compose amorous poetry about his Harithi wife, and he is the one who said: [Poem in Sari' meter] Turn to us, mistress of the litter... indeed, if you do not do so, you commit a sin. The easiest thing a lover said at... the separation of a lover is his saying: Turn. Let a need be decreed to him, or let him say... Is there for me a way out from what I am in? Who greeted you? You departed and it did not cease... the passion of my wandering, ripe heart. She could do nothing but signal... with the glance of the eye of a black-eyed young gazelle. She drives away a tear with the hail (teeth/cold?)... brought by the eye but not produced. For fear of the slanderers lest they notice... her complaint, and the angry hater. I say when I missed from them... what I was hoping for of their connection. Indeed, a Yemeni woman was made available to me... one of Banu al-Harith from Madhhij. I will perform Hajj if she performs Hajj; and what is it to me... a weakness (Wahinah) if she does not perform Hajj? Abdullah ibn al-A'rabi al-Harith al-Fihri informed us that Ibrahim ibn al-Mundhir told them, saying Muhammad ibn Ma'n al-Ghafari told me, saying Umar ibn Abdullah ibn Nasr informed me: I was sitting with Talhah ibn Umar ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Ma'mar. Kuthayyir entered upon us while I was exemplifying with the saying of Jamil: [Poem in Tawil meter]",
