    "text": "Introduction by Dar Al-Falah: Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be upon the most honorable of all creation. To proceed: This is the section on the Sciences of Hadith according to the revered Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, from the Blessed Comprehensive Encyclopedia of the Sciences of the Revered Imam. Naturally, it does not include what the Imam narrated with his own chains of transmission (Musnad), as that is outside the scope of this encyclopedia. We had begun working on this section, but we found that the virtuous brother Ibrahim Al-Nahhas had preceded us to it, so we preferred to include him in the work rather than duplicating the effort. He performed his work—may Allah reward him well—with efficiency, although he has a slight difference from our method. He does not commit here to mentioning the narrator reporting from Imam Ahmad, and we addressed this in some places. Additionally, the matter is clear in some places from the source, but in other places, the researcher will need to refer to the original source if he needs the name of the narrator. Furthermore, he did not commit to the presence of the narrator in the source from which he quoted, which is something we adhered to in the rest of the encyclopedia. It is necessary here to point out that many of the issues found in this section were repeated in places within the Jurisprudence (Fiqh) section, which makes mentioning the narrator here less critical. He also added some jurisprudential comments in the footnotes, which is something we did not do in the rest of the work except rarely. There are also differences in other technical matters rather than scientific ones. We have adjusted most of the attributions to the editions approved by us, and we modified the arrangement of some issues, with slight additions. The brother Ibrahim prefaced his work with an introduction in which he clarified his methodology, touched upon matters related to the science of Hadith, gave a glimpse of Imam Ahmad's methodology in criticism and praise (Jarh wa Ta'dil), and then mentioned the sources of Imam Ahmad's statements upon which he relied.",

    "text": "Author's Introduction \"Ibrahim Al-Nahhas\": Praise be to Allah, the Creator of creation and the Forgiver of sins, the One who is aware of consciences and intentions. He encompassed everything in knowledge, and embraced everything in mercy and forbearance, and subdued every creature with might and wisdom. Visions cannot perceive Him, eras cannot change Him, and thoughts cannot imagine Him. He perfected what He made and consolidated it, and He counted everything and knew it. He raised the status of knowledge and magnified it, and out of His generosity, He singled out for it whom He willed from His creation. He urged His believing servants to mobilize to gain understanding in the religion, and He summoned them to warn His creation, just as He summoned the people of His Message to that. He granted them the inheritance of the people of His Prophethood, and accepted them to uphold His proof, and to deputize for Him in informing about His Sharia, and distinguished them from among His servants with fearing Him. Then He commanded the rest of the people to ask them and to refer to their sayings, and He made the sign of their deviation and misguidance the disappearance of their scholars. Among these acting scholars is Imam Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, the Mufti of the Ummah. Allah singled him out with abundant virtue, a fragrant mind, and perfect knowledge. The regions resounded with his mention, and the eras were stingy with the likes of him; he was the most fulfilling of them in virtue, the most following of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, the most knowledgeable of him, the most ascetic in this world, and the most obedient to his Lord. Ibn al-Qayyim (1) said: 'In the City of Peace (Baghdad), the Imam of Ahl al-Sunnah without exception was Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, who filled the earth with knowledge, Hadith, and Sunnah, such that the Imams of Hadith and Sunnah after him are his followers until the Day of Judgment. He, may Allah be pleased with him, had a severe dislike for authoring books and loved the stripping of Hadith (writing Hadith only), and he disliked that his speech be written down, and this was very hard on him. So Allah knew...",

    "text": "...the goodness of his intention and his purpose from his speech, and his Fatwas are more than thirty volumes, and Allah, Glory be to Him, bestowed most of them upon us, so we missed only a little of them. Al-Khallal collected his texts in \"Al-Jami' Al-Kabir\" (The Great Collection), reaching about twenty volumes or more. His Fatwas and issues were narrated and spoken of century after century, becoming a leader and a model for the people of the Sunnah across their various classes. Even those who differed with his school of thought through Ijtihad (independent reasoning) and those who imitated others venerated his texts and Fatwas, acknowledging their right and their closeness to the texts and Fatwas of the Companions. Whoever contemplates his Fatwas and the Fatwas of the Companions will see the conformity of each to the other, seeing all of them as if they emerge from a single niche. Even when the Companions differed on two opinions, two narrations would come from him on the issue. His investigation of the Fatwas of the Companions was like his companions' investigation of his Fatwas and texts, or even greater, such that he would prioritize their Fatwas over the Mursal (disconnected) Hadith. Ishaq bin Ibrahim Ibn Hani said in his \"Masa'il\" (Issues): I said to Abu Abdillah: Is a Mursal Hadith from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, with confirmed narrators, more beloved to you, or a Hadith from the Companions and Tabi'in that is connected with confirmed narrators? Abu Abdillah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: From the Companions is more pleasing to me.' I say: This indicates Imam Ahmad's strong adherence to Hadith and Athar. Abdullah mentioned in his \"Masa'il\" (1) to his father, saying: I heard my father - and he mentioned the writing of books - say: 'I dislike them. This Abu Hanifa wrote a book, then came Abu Yusuf and wrote a book, then came Ibn al-Hasan and wrote a book; so this has no end. Whenever a man comes, he writes a book. And this Malik wrote a book, and Al-Shafi'i also came, and this one came - meaning Abu Thawr - and the writing of these books is an innovation. Whenever a man comes, he writes a book and abandons the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and his Companions.' Or as my father said this or something similar.",

    "text": "He faulted the writing of books and disliked it with severe dislike. My father used to dislike the \"Jami' of Sufyan\" and denounced it, disliking it severely, and he said: 'Who heard this from Sufyan?' I never saw him validate anyone's hearing from Sufyan, nor was my father pleased to hear Hadith from anyone [via these books]. Know that among the most important investigations of this science and the most critical for achieving the desired goal of the science of Hadith is the knowledge of the Defects of Hadith ('Ilal al-Hadith). It is a precise art; for through it, the points of entry for illusion and error in the narrations of trustworthy narrators (Thiqat), whose transmission is predominantly sound and upright, are revealed. Due to its precision, it has not been realized except by a small group of scholars who thereby became leaders to be followed and authorities to be referred to. Deriving this noble science comes from the speech of these Imams and their methodologies. By studying and contemplating that, the student of the science of Hadith acquires the eligibility to speak in this precise art. Hafiz Ibn Rajab, may Allah have mercy on him, said: 'There must be in this science long practice and frequent discussion. If discussion of it is lacking, then its seeker should increase his reading of the speech of the knowledgeable Imams like Yahya al-Qattan, and those who received from him like Ahmad, Ali bin al-Madini, and others. Whoever is granted the reading of that and understands it, and his soul comprehends it, will develop a strength of soul and a faculty suitable for him to speak in it' (1). May Allah have mercy on Abu Abdillah for his strong adherence to Hadiths and Athar and his abandonment of other news. For this reason, our choice fell upon his sayings regarding the judgment of Hadiths, for he is the forerunner of its knights, and in jurisprudence (Fiqh) the forerunner of its field, and the most knowledgeable of people in Fatwa in his time, and rarely does time allow for the likes of him.",

However, if he spoke of it with criticism, I mention it. - The paths I mentioned in the extraction (Takhrij) are the same paths mentioned by Imam Ahmad regarding this text. You may find in the Takhrij: \"I did not find it\"; meaning: among the paths mentioned by Imam Ahmad, even though the text might be preserved. - I arranged the chapters in a jurisprudential (Fiqh) order, seeking help from the method of the authors of the two Sahihs, even in what I used to title the chapter. - I may address some jurisprudential issues in some chapters in the footnotes; to complete the benefit and increase utility.",

They also added two books at the end of the book: one on what was reported from Imam Ahmad regarding the strange/uncommon Hadith (Gharib al-Hadith), and the other on what was reported from Imam Ahmad regarding the sciences of Hadith. Thus, the benefit increased and the intention was completed, if Allah wills. I ask Allah to benefit whoever writes it, reads it, acquires it, or strives for anything of it.

Then I apologize to those of understanding for the shortcomings occurring in this book, and I ask them to look with the eye of satisfaction and correctness. Whatever deficiency there is, complete it, and whatever error there is, correct it; for rarely is an author free from lapses or safe from stumbles. I ask Allah for beautiful forgiveness and abundant pardon, and to overlook shortcomings and forgetfulness. Praise be to Allah, the Guardian of blessings, and may Allah bless the one who is the seal of the Prophets, his family the lamps of the darkness, and his noble, illustrious companions.

    "text": "Imam Ahmad's Methodology and Terminology in Criticism and Praise (Jarh wa Ta'dil): Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, was the divine scholar of the Ummah in his time, its knowledgeable one, its jurist, its memorizer, its worshiper, and its ascetic. The fame of his virtues and merits makes it unnecessary to elaborate on them. Scholars have devoted individual compositions to his merits; some were lengthy and some concise. Whoever wants more should refer to his biography detailed in known sources. What concerns us here is his methodology and knowing the meanings of his terminologies which his companions knew and which this Imam, may Allah have mercy on him, followed. As is known, Imam Ahmad's methodology in jurisprudential issues relies on the Book, the Sunnah, Consensus, and the practice of the Companions and Tabi'in. Imam Ahmad often relies in his methodology on acting upon the Hadith even if it is not authentic (Sahih). Ibn Rajab, Ibn Taymiyyah, and others said: Imam Ahmad takes the weak Hadith, if there is nothing else in the chapter, as more beloved to him than opinion (Ra'y), and this is apparent. However, I found through induction and tracking of Imam Ahmad's books that he, may Allah have mercy on him, may adopt a weak Hadith for jurisprudential practice, even if there is an authentic Hadith in the chapter, so he adopts that as well, and thus has two narrations regarding it. Al-Khallal said (1): 'Abu Abdillah requires anyone who imitates his school of thought to know it from the narration of a group; because a group might narrate a single issue from him until his saying on it becomes ten [variations] or so. This is because a group might ask him about a single issue until he says \"I do not know,\" meaning only: \"I do not know what I choose.\" He is asked about that very issue, and answers with the difference [of opinion] to those who said no and yes, and no [single] opinion is executed for him. And he is asked about that issue...",

And he is asked about it also at a time, and he answers with his view without arguing for the issue if the matter has become clear to him. And he is asked about that also and arguments are presented against him. And he is asked about his view and what he has adopted, so he answers them. Thus, his view on that issue at that time becomes [established]. And in his issues, may Allah have mercy on him, are matters that a man needs to understand and not hasten. He has said: \"Perhaps I remained on an issue - some of them mentioned - from ten years to three years.\" I have clarified all of this in this topic. I mean: for anyone who imitates anything from the school of Abu Abdillah, not to hasten and to verify. May Allah benefit us and you, and we ask Him for success, for He is Kind. For Abu Abdillah was a man who did not proceed except according to the Book, the Sunnah, and the saying of the Companions and Tabi'in. He loved safety and verification in what he said, and he would withhold the answer. If he answered, he would not answer except with what is correct.' I say: Imam Ahmad's methodology in jurisprudential issues relies on the Book, the Sunnah, Consensus, and the practice of the Companions and Tabi'in. He often relies in his methodology on acting upon the Hadith even if it is not authentic. Al-Athram said: 'Abu Abdillah might find a Hadith from the Prophet, peace be upon him, with something [weakness] in its chain, yet he adopts it if nothing contradictory to it is more established than it, like the Hadith of Amr bin Shu'ayb and Ibrahim al-Hajari. And he might adopt the Mursal (disconnected) Hadith if nothing contradictory to it comes.' Ibn Rajab mentioned in \"Sharh 'Ilal al-Tirmidhi\" (1) saying: 'The apparent meaning of Ahmad's speech is that the Mursal, according to him, is a type of weak [Hadith], but he adopts the Hadith even if there is weakness in it, as long as nothing contradictory comes from the Prophet, peace be upon him, or from the Companions.'",

    "text": "Therefore, it was mandatory for anyone seeking Fiqh (jurisprudence) according to the school of Imam Ahmad to first study Hadith comprehensively to understand the books of 'Ilal (defects) and the expressions of Imam Ahmad and others. This is because Imam Ahmad might use a Hadith as proof and act upon it, saying: (I go with it), while in another place he weakens it and describes it as Munkar (denounced). Example: Ibn Rajab quoted in \"Sharh al-Bukhari\" (1): Imam Ahmad said regarding the Hadith of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her: \"Women are the twin halves of men.\" He said: This is Munkar. And he [also] said: I go with it. Also, Ibn Rajab quoted in \"Sharh Ilal al-Tirmidhi\" (2), and Al-Khallal in \"Al-Jami' li-Ahkam Ahl al-Dhimmah\" (3): The saying of Imam Ahmad regarding the Hadith of Ma'mar, from Al-Zuhri, from Salim, from Ibn Omar, that Ghailan accepted Islam while he had ten wives. He said: It is not Sahih (authentic), but the practice is based upon it. Abdul-Razzaq used to say: From Ma'mar, from Al-Zuhri, as Mursal (hurried/disconnected). Ibn al-Qayyim said in \"Al-Farusiyyah\" (4): Imam Ahmad narrated the Hadith of Ali: That Al-Abbas asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, regarding expediting his charity (Zakat) before it was due, and he granted him a concession in that (5). Al-Athram said: I heard Abu Abdullah, when this Hadith was mentioned to him, weaken it and say: That is nothing. This is despite the fact that his school (Madhab) allows the expediting of Zakat. Also, Ibn al-Qayyim quoted Imam Ahmad regarding the Hadith of Aisha: \"There is no vow in",

    "text": "disobedience, and its expiation is the expiation of an oath.\" He said: This is a Munkar Hadith, even though he narrated it, built his Madhab upon it, and used it as proof. I say: Ibn Qudamah mentioned in \"Al-Mughni\" (1) the saying of Imam Ahmad regarding the Hadith of Ibn Omar, may Allah be pleased with them both: \"Arabs are equals to one another, except a weaver or a cupper.\" It was said to Imam Ahmad: How do you take this while you weaken it? He said: The practice is based upon it. More severe than this is that he may weaken a Hadith merely by turning away from it, even if he does not speak about it, and he goes to the Athar (traditions) of the Companions. An example of that: In the issue of shortening prayer (Qasr) during travel: Ibn Qudamah quoted in \"Al-Mughni\" (2): Al-Athram said: It was said to Abu Abdullah: In how much [distance] is the prayer shortened? He said: In four Burud. It was said to him: A full day's journey? He said: No, four Burud - sixteen Farsakhs - a journey of two days. Ibn Qudamah said: And this is the view of Ibn Abbas and Ibn Omar, and it is the view held by Malik, Al-Layth, Al-Shafi'i, and Ishaq. I say: In this chapter, there is a Hadith narrated by Muslim (3) via the path of Shu'bah, from Yahya bin Yazid Al-Huna'i, who said: I asked Anas bin Malik about shortening the prayer? He said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he went out for a distance of three miles - or three Farsakhs, Shu'bah was in doubt - would pray two Rak'ahs. I say: Yahya bin Yazid Al-Huna'i is not among the companions of Anas, and he has very few narrations, or he has nothing in the Six Books except this Hadith from Anas. Ibn Ma'in said about him:",

    "text": "\"Suwaylih\" (little righteous/acceptable). And Abu Hatim said: \"Sheikh\" [Often used by Abu Hatim to imply being unknown]. Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Taqrib\": Maqbul (Acceptable). Al-Dhahabi said in \"Al-Mizan\": There is no harm in him. I say: Such a narrator does not bear [the weight of] Hadiths of rulings (Ahkam), regarding which Imam Ahmad said: \"If they [narrations of Halal and Haram] come, we want men like this,\" and he closed his hand and raised his thumb; implying trustworthy, firm narrators. Among those who weakened the Hadith because of Yahya bin Yazid Al-Huna'i was Ibn Abd al-Barr in \"Al-Istidhkar\" (1), for he said: Yahya bin Yazid Al-Huna'i is a Sheikh from the people of Basra; one like him cannot carry this meaning which contradicts the majority of the Companions and the Tabi'in, nor is he one to be trusted in preserving this principle. From the foregoing, it becomes clear to you that Imam Ahmad did not use this Hadith as proof for the reasons you know, and he turned away from it and took the traditions of the Companions. Sometimes the traditions of the Companions may also be weak, yet Imam Ahmad acts upon them, so one must pay attention to that. Thus, legal practice may coincide with the authenticity of a Hadith, and it may not coincide in the school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him. Another example: Imam Ahmad said, when asked about the Hadith of Malik bin al-Huwayrith: That he saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, praying, and when he was in an odd-numbered Rak'ah of his prayer, he did not rise until he sat up straight (2). Imam Ahmad said: Sahih. And he said once: This Hadith has no second. Meaning: This sitting was not narrated in other than this. And he said once: Most Hadiths do not mention anything of that. I say: Imam Ahmad is pointing out that the sitting of rest (Jalsat al-Istirahah) was not narrated in a Hadith other than",

    "text": "this. But it has been narrated - i.e., the sitting of rest - in the Hadith of \"the one who prayed badly\" (Al-Musi' Salatahu). So when he turned away from it and did not mention it, can it be said: That he did not come across the Hadith of the one who prayed badly? This matter is unlikely; due to the fame of this Hadith among the common people, so how about the Imam of Ahl al-Sunnah. Furthermore, there was disagreement over Ubaydullah Al-Umari regarding this Hadith. Al-Qattan and Abu Usamah narrated it without it [the sitting], while Ibn Numair narrated it from him affirming it. The most likely view, and Allah knows best, is that it is not established; Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" (1): Al-Bukhari indicated that this phrase is a delusion (Wahm), for he said following the Hadith: Abu Usamah said at the end: 'Until you stand up straight.' And it is possible to interpret it, if it is preserved, as sitting for the Tashahhud. Ibn Rajab said in \"Al-Fath\": This phrase has been disputed in the Hadith of Abu Huraira; some narrators mentioned that he ordered him to sit after the two prostrations, and some mentioned that he ordered him to stand after them, and this is what is more likely. For this Hadith, no one mentioned in it that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, taught him any of the agreed-upon Sunan of prayer, so how could he have ordered him with this sitting? This is very remote (2). He said: Then I found that Al-Bayhaqi mentioned this, and mentioned that there was disagreement regarding Abu Usamah about mentioning this second sitting after the two prostrations. He said: The correct narration from him is that he said after mentioning the two prostrations: \"Then rise until you stand up straight.\" Al-Bayhaqi said: Al-Bukhari narrated it in his \"Sahih\" from Ishaq bin Mansur from Abu Usamah, and mentioned the narration of Ibn Numair but did not mention Al-Bukhari's extraction of it, and Yahya bin Sa'id did not mention in his narration the second prostration nor what followed it of sitting or standing. He said: And standing is more similar to what the report was driven for, which is counting the pillars (Arkan) not the Sunan. And Allah knows best.",

    "text": "Ibn Rajab said: This indicates that the mention of the second sitting is not preserved from Yahya. [I say]: From the foregoing, the reason for Imam Ahmad's turning away from this addition becomes clear, which is its weakness and lack of establishment. Thus he said regarding the Hadith of Malik bin al-Huwayrith that this sitting was not narrated in other than this. So Imam Ahmad's turning away from this Hadith and negating it indicates its weakness according to him, even if he did not weaken it explicitly. Ibn al-Qayyim said in \"Al-Farusiyyah\" (1): His methodology - meaning Imam Ahmad - is that he does not prioritize anything over a Sahih Hadith whatsoever, neither practice, nor analogy (Qiyas), nor the opinion of a Companion. If there is no Sahih Hadith in the issue, and there is a weak Hadith in it, and there is nothing in the chapter to refute it, he acts upon it. But if something stronger opposes it, he leaves it for the stronger opponent. And if there is a weak Hadith and an analogy in the issue, he prioritizes the weak Hadith over the analogy. The \"weak\" in his terminology is not the \"weak\" in the terminology of the later scholars. Rather, he and the early scholars divided Hadith into Sahih and Da'if (Weak), and the Hasan (Good) according to them fell within the Weak according to its ranks. The first one known to have divided it into three sections was Abu Isa Al-Tirmidhi, then people followed him after that. So Ahmad prioritizes the Weak, which is Hasan (2) according to him, over analogy, and does not pay attention to the flimsy Weak (Al-Wahi) which cannot serve as proof; rather, he disapproves of anyone who uses it as proof or follows it.

Much discussion has revolved around Imam Ahmad's use of the term \"Munkar\".

Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in \"Hady al-Sari\" in the biography of Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al-Taimi - the narrator of the Hadith \"Actions are but by intentions\" - after mentioning Imam Ahmad's saying: \"He narrates Munkar Hadiths.\" He said: Munkar is used by Ahmad bin Hanbal and a group [of scholars] for a singular Hadith that has no corroborator. Al-Hafiz's opinion becomes clearer in \"Al-Nukat\" (1), he said: Imam Ahmad, Al-Nasa'i, and more than one of the critics have applied the term Munkar to mere singularity, but [this applies] where the singularity is not of the weight of one whose Hadith is judged as Sahih without a supporter to support it. Al-Hafiz's statement here is close to Imam Ahmad's method, but for Imam Ahmad, even if the solitary narrator is among the trustworthy or the senior trustworthy ones, [it is Munkar] due to indicators, the most important of which are delusion (Wahm) and error.",

The one unique in narrating it was Malik bin Anas, so he did not accept it, until Imam Malik was corroborated, then he accepted it. This is the school of Yahya bin Sa'id and more than one of the critics. Muslim said in the introduction to the \"Sahih\": The sign of the Munkar in the Hadith of a narrator is: if his narration of the Hadith is compared to the narration of others from the people of preservation and satisfaction, his narration contradicts their narration, or it hardly matches it. If the majority of his Hadith is like that: he is abandoned in Hadith (Mahjur al-Hadith), not accepted nor used. Al-Dhahabi said in \"Al-Muwqizah\" (2): A group of the Hafizs might call a Hadith in which someone like Hushaym bin Ghiyath is alone as Munkar. If the solitary narrator is from the rank of the Sheikhs of the Imams, they applied Nakarah to what he was alone in, like Uthman bin Abi Shaybah and Abu Salama Al-Tabudhaki, and they said: This is Munkar. He also said in \"Al-Mizan\" (3) in the biography of Ali bin Al-Madini: The singularity of the Saduq (truthful) and those below him is considered Munkar. In \"Masa'il Ibn Hani\" (4) to Imam Ahmad: It was said to him: These benefits (Fawa'id) which contain Munkar [narrations], do you see that the Munkar Hadith should be written?

Munkar) and most of them are from the weak. Ibn Rajab said in \"Sharh al-Tirmidhi\" (2): I have not found for anyone of the early scholars a limit for the Munkar of Hadith and its definition except what Abu Bakr Al-Bardiji the Hafiz - and he was among the notable prominent Hafizs - mentioned in Al-Ilal: That Munkar is what a man narrates from the Companions, or from the Tabi'in from the Companions, and that Hadith and the text of the Hadith is not known except from the path of the one who narrated it, so it is Munkar. He mentioned this speech in the context of if Shu'bah, or Sa'id bin Abi Aruba, or Hisham Al-Dastuwa'i were alone in a Hadith from Qatada from Anas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. This is like explicitly stating that whatever a trustworthy person narrates alone from a trustworthy person, and the text is not known from other than that path, is Munkar.

If the Hadith is preserved from other than their path from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, or from Anas bin Malik from another aspect, it is not rejected. But if it is not known from anyone from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, except from a path from Anas, except from the narration of this one I mentioned to you, it is Munkar. And he said: If a trustworthy person narrates via a Sahih path from a man from the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a Hadith that is not found except with that single man, it does not harm him that no one else narrates it if the text of the Hadith is known, and it is neither Munkar nor defective (Ma'lul). And he said regarding a Hadith narrated by Amr bin Asim from Hammam from Ishaq bin Talha from Anas that a man said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace: I have committed a Hadd (punishable offense), so execute it upon me, may Allah be pleased with him... the Hadith. This, in my view, is a Munkar Hadith, and it is, in my view, a delusion from Amr bin Asim. Ibn Rajab said in \"Sharh Ilal al-Tirmidhi\" (1): As for most of the early Hafizs, they say regarding a Hadith if one person is alone in it, even if the trustworthy narrators did not narrate differently, that he is not corroborated in it, and they make that a defect in it. Unless he is one whose memorization was abundant and whose integrity and Hadith were famous, like Al-Zuhri and his likes. And perhaps they denounce some singularities of the senior trustworthy narrators as well. They have a specific criticism for every Hadith, and they do not have a rule that governs it.

Meaning: It is a delusion from Ismail bin Ayyash (1). - And in \"Al-Du'afa\" by Al-Uqayli (2): Al-Athram said: I said to Ahmad: Do you preserve from Abdullah bin Raja, from Ubaidullah, from Nafi', from Ibn Omar \"The Halal is clear\"? He said: This is Munkar, I do not regard this as anything. Abu Ubaidullah said to me: This Ibn Raja claimed that his books had gone, so he started writing what he memorized, and perhaps he imagined this. Then Ahmad spoke well of the status of Abdullah. - And in the book \"Al-Ilal wa Ma'rifat al-Rijal\" (3) narration of Al-Marudhi: I said to Ahmad: Do you know from Al-Walid, from Al-Awza'i, from Yahya, from Abu Salama, from Abu Huraira,",

He said: This is Munkar; this is from the error of Al-Awza'i, and he often errs from Yahya bin Abi Kathir. Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Tahdhib\" (1) in the biography of Al-Fadl bin Dalham: Al-Athram said from Ahmad: There is no harm in him except that he has [some] Hadiths. I said: Is he from Wasit? He said: Yes, I do not know anyone who narrated from Waki' from him. He said: And I heard Abu Abdullah mention his Hadith from Al-Hasan, from Qabisah bin Hurayth, from Salama bin Al-Muhabbiq, the Hadith: \"Take from me.\" He said: This is a Munkar Hadith. Meaning: He erred in it; because Qatada and others narrated it from Al-Hasan from Hattan bin Abdullah Al-Raqashi from Ubadah. - And he also said regarding the Hadith of Aisha: Regarding leaving Wudu (ablution) from a kiss: This is Munkar. Ibn Rajab quoted it in \"Sharh Ilal al-Tirmidhi\" (2). And he said once: We see that it is a mistake; for Urwah mentioned in the Hadith is Urwah Al-Muzani and he did not meet Aisha. And Ibrahim Al-Taimi also narrated it from Aisha, and his hearing from Aisha is not authentic. - And in \"Al-Ilal\" (3) narration of Abdullah bin Ahmad: He said regarding the Hadith of Al-Bara bin Azib, may Allah be pleased with him, regarding the saying of the Exalted: {Look at its fruit when it fruits} [Al-An'am: 99]. He said: Its ripening when it ripens. Imam Ahmad said: This is not from the Hadith of Abu Ishaq \"this is eaten\"; as if he denounced it from the Hadith of Ammar, that it is a delusion, and Ibrahim Al-Harawi narrated the Hadith to us. - And in \"Al-Ilal\" narration of Abdullah, and \"Al-Muntakhab by Ibn Qudamah from Ilal Al-Khallal\", and \"Fada'il al-Sahabah\" by Ahmad (4): He mentioned the Hadith of Abu Bakr: \"No wealth benefited me",

He said: It should be so. - And in \"Al-Muntakhab by Ibn Qudamah from Ilal Al-Khallal\", and \"Tarikh Baghdad\", he mentioned the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him: \"Islam began as a stranger and will return as a stranger as it began\"; Ahmad said: This is a Munkar Hadith (2), and once: Al-A'mash erred in it (3). - And in \"Du'afa Al-Uqayli\", and \"Al-Ilal\" narration of Abdullah (4): He mentioned the Hadith of Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to witness with the Mushrikin (polytheists) their festivals. Imam Ahmad said: This Hadith is very Munkar or fabricated, or it is as if it is fabricated. And he said: We see him imagining. Meaning: Uthman bin Muhammad bin Abi Shaybah. The Imams also applied Nakarah to delusion and error even if the singular narrator is trustworthy.

The delusion in it is from Hammam, and no one narrated it except Hammam. Ibn Abd al-Barr said (1) in \"Al-Tamhid\": They used as proof the Hadith of Abdul-Razzaq, from Al-Thawri, from Sulayman Al-Shaibani, from Yazid bin Al-Asam, from Ibn Abbas, that a man asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying: Should I perform Hajj on behalf of my father? He said: \"Yes, if you do not increase him in good, you will not increase him in evil.\" Abu Omar said: As for this Hadith, they blamed Abdul-Razzaq for it; because he was alone in it from Al-Thawri among all his companions. They said: This is a Hadith not found in the world with anyone with this Isnad except in the book of Abdul-Razzaq or in the book of one who extracted it from the book of Abdul-Razzaq, and no one narrated it from Al-Thawri other than him. They considered it a mistake and to them it is an error. They said: This is a Munkar wording; the words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, do not resemble ordering something about which he does not know whether it benefits or does not benefit. [I say]: You will often find in this book from the expressions of Imam Ahmad applying Nakarah to delusion and error, even if the solitary narrator is trustworthy and even if he did not contradict. Nakarah is also applied to the narration of the weak. Examples of that: - In \"Sunan Al-Bayhaqi\", \"Nasb al-Rayah\", and \"Zad al-Ma'ad\" (2), the saying of Imam Ahmad regarding the Hadith of Amr bin al-Aas, may Allah be pleased with him: Do not confuse us regarding the Sunnah of our Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace; the waiting period (Iddah) of the one whose husband has died is four months and ten [days].",

Yahya bin Ma'in said: Yes, Yahya bin Adam narrates it, from Sufyan, from Zubaid, and we do not know anyone who narrates it except Yahya bin Adam, and this is an illusion. If this were so, all people would have narrated it from Sufyan, but it is a denounced Hadith.",

Also, Al-Nasa'i narrated in \"Al-Kubra\" (4) via Isa bin Muhammad Abu Umair Al-Ramli, and Isa bin Yunus attributed it, Huri narrated to us, from Murrah, from Sufyan, from Abdullah bin Dinar, from Ibn Umar who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: \"Whoever owns a Mahram relative, [the relative] becomes free.\"",

There is no precise definition for these terms in the speech of the early Imams as the later scholars defined denouncement (Nakarah). Denouncement is lifted according to Imam Ahmad and other critics by indicators such as corroboration (Mutaba'ah), as previously mentioned in the Hadith of Malik regarding the addition \"from the Muslims\", so when it was corroborated it was accepted. And as in the Hadith of Jabir bin Abdullah regarding prayer times which Al-Tirmidhi narrated (1), and in it: \"Gabriel led me at the House twice, so he prayed Dhuhr in the first...\" the Hadith. Imam Ahmad said about it: This Hadith is not denounced; because Al-Husayn bin Ali who narrated it was agreed with by others on some of its descriptions (2). And as he said regarding the Hadith of Abdullah bin Zaid, may Allah be pleased with him, regarding reciting aloud in the prayer for rain, which Al-Bukhari narrated (3), he said: I used to denounce it until I saw the narration of Ma'mar from Al-Zuhri as Ibn Abi Dhi'b said.

Ibn Rajab said: Imam Ahmad's rule is that what a trustworthy person (Thiqah) is unique in narrating, judgment is suspended on it until he is corroborated on it, so if he is corroborated, its denouncement is removed, and this is the rule of Yahya Al-Qattan, Ibn Al-Madini and others, and also by other indicators.

Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out quickly, called for the prayer (Iqamah), and prayed, and he was brief in his prayer. When he made the Taslim, he said: \"Stay in your rows as you are.\" Then he turned to us and said: \"I will tell you what detained me from you this morning. I stood up in the night and prayed what was decreed for me, then I slumbered in my prayer until I woke up, and lo, I was with my Lord, Mighty and Majestic, in the best form. He said: 'O Muhammad, do you know what the Highest Assembly disputes about?' I said: 'I do not know, O Lord.' He said: 'O Muhammad, what does the Highest Assembly dispute about?' I said: 'I do not know, Lord.' Then I saw Him place His palm between my shoulders until I felt the coolness of His fingertips between my chest, so everything became manifest to me and I knew. He said: 'O Muhammad, what does the Highest Assembly dispute about?' I said: 'About expiations.' He said: 'And what are the expiations?' I said: 'Moving footsteps to the Friday prayers, sitting in the mosques after the prayer, and perfecting ablution during hardships.' He said: 'And what are the degrees?' I said: 'Feeding food, soft speech, and prayer while people are asleep.' He said: 'Ask.' I said: 'O Allah, I ask You for the performance of good deeds, the abandonment of evil deeds, the love of the poor, and that You forgive me and have mercy on me. And if You intend a trial for a people, then cause me to die without being tested. And I ask You for Your love, the love of those who love You, and the love of a deed that brings me closer to Your love.'\" And the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: \"It is truth, so study it and learn it.\"",

Abu Zur'ah Al-Razi said about him: Not known (Laysa bi-Ma'ruf). I say: One like this cannot support uniqueness, let alone having disagreement over him.

So he was inconsistent in this Hadith despite the obscurity in him, so the defect is apparent, and whoever defends it has missed the truth. And Allah knows best. Benefit: Imam Ahmad's saying: (The most correct of them) does not mean the authenticity of the Hadith as Ibn Adi, may Allah have mercy on him, understood. It only means that Abdul-Rahman bin A'ish narrated it well and reported it as connected only while acknowledging the disorder. And Allah knows best.

Then he said: So the meaning of the report—if it is authentic via the path of transmission as Musnad (connected)—is that the son of Adam was created in the image in which the Most Merciful created Adam, then He breathed the soul into him. I say: The narration of Jarir from Al-A'mash is spoken against, and he was alone in narrating it from the companions of Al-A'mash. Benefit: Abu Ya'la reported in 'Tabaqat al-Hanabilah' 1/93, in the biography of Ibrahim bin Aban al-Mawsili: He has issues from our Imam, among them: He said: I heard Abu Abdullah, and a man came to him and said: 'I heard Abu Thawr say: Allah created Adam in the image of Himself.' He [Ahmad] lowered his head for a long time, then struck his face with his hand and said: 'This is evil speech! This is the speech of Jahm! This is a Jahmi! Do not go near him.' It was also reported from Ahmad 1/309 that he said: 'The matter is confirmed against Abu Thawr; whoever says that Allah created Adam in the image of Adam is a Jahmi. And what image did Adam have before He created him?!' I say: We take from this the weakness of the interpretation adopted by Ibn Khuzaymah regarding the Hadith 'in His image', where he said: 'The son of Adam was created in the image in which the Most Merciful created Adam, then He breathed the soul into him.' Al-Dhahabi reported in 'Al-Siyar' 20/88 from Isma'il who said: 'Ibn Khuzaymah erred in the Hadith of the Image, but he is not to be defamed for that; rather, this specific point is not accepted from him.' I say: As for what was reported regarding Imam Ahmad authentication of the Hadith 'in the image of the Most Merciful', Ibn Abd al-Barr reported in 'Al-Tamhid' 7/147-148 that Ahmad's statement regarding the Hadith 'in His image' does not mean he authenticated the Hadith 'in the image of the Most Merciful'. Issue: Al-Hafiz said in 'Al-Fath' 5/217 (abridged): 'Allah created Adam in His image'; there is a difference of opinion regarding whom the pronoun refers to. The majority hold that it refers to the one being struck [in the context of 'do not strike the face'], due to the command to honor the face. Were it not that the intention was the reason for that, this sentence would have no connection to what preceded it. Al-Qurtubi said: Some returned the pronoun to Allah, holding on to what was reported in some chains: 'Allah created Adam in the image of the Most Merciful.' It is as if the one who narrated it reported it by meaning, holding on to what he imagined, and thus erred in that. Al-Maziri and those who followed him denied the authenticity of this addition, then said: 'And assuming its authenticity, it is interpreted in a manner befitting the Creator, Glory be to Him; it is necessary to interpret what is in that = ",

Leave argumentation, for it is enough of a sin that you never cease to be argumentative. Leave argumentation, for I will not intercede for the argumentative one on the Day of Resurrection.

Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful} [An-Nisa: 29]. So I performed Tayammum then prayed. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) laughed.\n3. Ibn Rajab in 'Sharh Al-Bukhari' 2/79.",

So I did that until I completed my Hajj, then he sent Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me and commanded me to perform Umrah in place of my [previous] Umrah from Al-Tan'im.",

(1) Sheikh Al-Albani, may Allah have mercy on him, mentioned in \"Al-Da'ifah\" Hadith number (949) quoting from Al-Hafiz Al-Iraqi in \"Tarh al-Tathrib\" 2/154 in the narration of Al-Maimuni that they discussed with Ahmad bin Hanbal the Hadith of Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba, so he said: Good chains (Asanid Jiyad), and Allah knows best. I say: The text of the Hadith is established and authentic in the two Sahihs from the Hadith of Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, in Al-Bukhari (536), and in Muslim (615). Important Benefit: The attribution of strangeness (Gharaba) here is not directed at the narration of Al-Himmani, for Imam Ahmad narrated it without mentioning Al-Himmani. Ibn Adi mentioned in \"Al-Kamil\" quoting from Ibn Sa'id that Ishaq Al-Azraq used to narrate strange things from Sharik. Issue: Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" 2/21: The majority of people of knowledge recommend delaying Zuhr in severe heat until the time cools down and the glare breaks, and some of them restricted it to the congregation. As for the individual, hastening is better in his right, and this is the saying of most Malikis and Al-Shafi'i as well, but he restricted it to hot lands and restricted the congregation to when they come to a mosque from a distance. So if they were gathered or were walking in shade, then hastening is better in their right. The famous view from Ahmad is equality without specification or restriction, and it is the saying of Ishaq, the Kufans, and Ibn Al-Mundhir.\n2. Narrated by Al-Bukhari (536), he said: Ali bin Abdullah told us, he said: Sufyan told us, he said: We memorized it from Al-Zuhri, from Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib, from Abu Huraira, from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he said: \"If the heat becomes severe, then cool the prayer, for the severity of heat is from the rage of Hell. And the Fire complained to its Lord saying: O Lord, parts of me have consumed other parts. So He permitted it two breaths: a breath in winter and a breath in summer. That is the most severe heat you find and the most severe cold (Zamharir) you find.\"\n3. \"Al-Muntakhab min Ilal Al-Khallal\" by Ibn Qudamah (186).

Al-Layth and Amr Ibn Al-Harith narrated it in Muslim, and Ma'mar and Ibn Jurayj in Ahmad, and Ibn Akhi Al-Zuhri and Usama Ibn Zaid in Al-Sarraj, all six of them from Al-Zuhri from Sa'id and Abu Salama, both from Abu Huraira. Al-Daraqutni said in \"Al-Ilal\" 9/390-294: Both sayings are preserved from Al-Zuhri. Sheikh Tariq bin Awadullah, may Allah preserve him, said in the commentary on \"Al-Muntakhab\" by Ibn Qudamah that Imam Ahmad's faulting of Ibn Uyaynah has a valid basis. That is because Ibn Uyaynah narrated from Al-Zuhri, from Sa'id, from Abu Huraira two texts both in one context. First: \"If the heat becomes severe, then cool the prayer, for the severity of heat is from the rage of Hell.\" Second: \"The Fire complained to its Lord saying: O Lord, parts of me have consumed other parts...\" The Hadith. And the generality of Al-Zuhri's companions do not narrate the Hadith from Al-Zuhri like this; rather, they narrate the first text only from Sa'id and Abu Salama both from Abu Huraira. As for the second text, none of Al-Zuhri's companions narrated it from Sa'id; rather, Shu'aib bin Abi Hamza and Yunus bin Yazid narrated it from Al-Zuhri, from Abu Salama, from Abu Huraira. Except what is narrated from Ja'far bin Burqan where he followed Ibn Uyaynah in narrating the second text from Al-Zuhri from Sa'id, but Ja'far bin Burqan is nothing regarding Al-Zuhri. Thus, Ibn Uyaynah's contradiction to Al-Zuhri's companions becomes apparent, as he carried the second text on the chain of the first text from the Hadith of Sa'id and Abu Salama together, while the second is from the Hadith of Abu Salama only. With this, the piercing insight of Imam Ahmad, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, becomes apparent. I say: And the Hadith: \"The Fire complained\" is established in Al-Bukhari number (3260) via the path of Abu Salama, from Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, in a Marfu' form with it.\n1.

Mansur bin Zadhan, Shu'ba, and Ayyub narrated it from Amr bin Dinar and did not say what Ibn Uyaynah said. Thus he said. And Ibn Ajlan also narrated it from Ubaydullah bin Miqsam, from Jabir, like the narration of Ibn Uyaynah from Amr. And this is the strongest aspect, which is that those who narrated Mu'adh praying behind the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and returning to his people, none of them mentioned the story of prolonging and the complaint to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, except Ibn Uyaynah. And Ibn Ajlan followed him, from Ibn Miqsam, and Ibn Ajlan is not that strong. And those who mentioned Mu'adh's complaint to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from the trustworthy Hafizs did not mention in it that Mu'adh used to pray with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, then return to his people and lead them. And many of our companions did not understand this which Imam Ahmad intended correctly. Third: He said in the narration of Hanbal: This is by way of teaching from Mu'adh to his people. Meaning: He did not lead them except to teach them the prayer of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and did not intend the prayer [as an obligation for himself]. Just as Malik bin Al-Huwayrith taught his people the prayer of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and did not intend the prayer. But the difference between him and the Hadith of Mu'adh is that Malik bin Al-Huwayrith taught his people the prayer outside of prayer time, so they were all performing voluntary prayer, while Mu'adh used to pray the obligatory prayer, then return to his people who were waiting for him to lead them in it, so they were performing obligatory prayer. Fourth: He said in the narration of Ibrahim Al-Harbi: If it is authentic, it has a precise meaning; the like of it is not permissible today. And it has been said: This meaning which Imam Ahmad referred to is that it was in the beginning of Islam, and those who could recite the Quran were few, so they were granted a concession in that as an expansion for them. When the reciters became many, that [concession] ended. And Abbas Al-Duri narrated from Yahya bin Ma'in that he said regarding the Hadith of Mu'adh that he used to lead his companions, having prayed before that with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Yahya said: I do not see this [as valid]. Abbas said: The meaning of this according to us: That Yahya used to say this was in the beginning of Islam, and those who recite the Quran were few, so I do not see this [now]. This is Yahya's saying according to us. And Ibn Shahin mentioned, from Abu Bakr Al-Najjad, that he heard Ibrahim Al-Harbi being asked about one who prayed an obligatory prayer behind a volunteer. He said: It is not permissible. It was said to him: Then the Hadith of Mu'adh? He said: The Hadith of Mu'adh baffled the first generations.",

And the Hadith of Mu'adh has been authenticated that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, knew of it and approved it. And Sufyan bin Uyaynah was corroborated on that. So the stronger view is: The permissibility of the one praying obligatory prayer following the one praying voluntary prayer.\n1. Narrated by Al-Bukhari (4302), he said: Sulayman bin Harb told us, Hammad bin Zaid told us, from Ayyub, from Abu Qilaba, from Amr bin Salama, he said: Abu Qilaba said to me: Why don't you meet him and ask him? He said: So I met him and asked him. He said: We were at a water source where people passed. Riders would pass by us, so we would ask them: What is with the people, what is with the people? Who is this man? They would say: He claims that Allah has sent him, revealed to him, or Allah revealed such and such. I used to memorize that speech, and it was as if it was glued in my chest. The Arabs were delaying their Islam until the Conquest, saying: Leave him and his people, for if he prevails over them, then he is a truthful Prophet. When the event of the people of the Conquest occurred, every tribe hastened to embrace Islam, and my father hastened my tribe to Islam. When he returned, he said: I came to you, by Allah, from the Prophet truly. He said: \"Pray such and such prayer at such and such time, and such and such prayer at such and such time. When prayer time comes, let one of you call the Adhan, and let the one who knows the most Quran among you lead you.\" So they looked, and there was no one who knew more Quran than me; because I used to receive from the riders. So they put me forward in front of them while I was a boy of six or seven years. I had a small cloak on me; when I prostrated, it would shrink up from me. So a woman from the tribe said: Will you not cover the buttocks of your reciter from us? So they bought [cloth] and cut a shirt for me. I never rejoiced over anything as I rejoiced over that shirt.\n2. \"Masa'il Abi Dawood\" (294), \"Al-Mughni\" 2/54, \"Tanqih Al-Tahqiq\" 1/23.",

The majority of narrations from him are that he did not see raising when going down to prostration, nor between the two prostrations, nor when rising from the two Rak'ahs, nor in other than the three places in the Hadith of Ibn Umar. Al-Athram narrated from him, when asked about raising hands, he said: In every lowering and raising. Al-Athram said: And I saw Abu Abdullah raising his hands in prayer in every lowering and raising.

They said: You were not the one among us with the earliest companionship with him, nor the one who came to him most. He said: Indeed. They said: Then present it. So he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to, when he stood for prayer, stand straight and raise his hands until he brought them parallel to his shoulders, and when he wanted to bow he raised his hands until he brought them parallel to his shoulders then said: \"Allahu Akbar\" and bowed...

The Hadith.\n2. \"Fath Al-Bari\" by Ibn Rajab 5/138. I say: This addition - i.e., the sitting of rest - was narrated in the Hadith of the one who prayed badly, but there was disagreement regarding it concerning Ubaydullah Al-Umari. Al-Qattan and Abu Usamah narrated it without it, and Ibn Numair narrated it from him confirming it. The most likely view - and Allah knows best - is that it is not established, for Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" 2/326: Al-Bukhari indicated that this phrase is a delusion, for he said after the Hadith: Abu Usamah said at the end: Until you stand up straight. And it can be interpreted, if it is preserved, as sitting for Tashahhud.\n3. Ibn Rajab said in \"Al-Fath\" 5/140-141: This phrase has been disputed in the Hadith of Abu Huraira. Some narrators mentioned that he ordered him to sit after the two prostrations, and some mentioned that he ordered him to stand after them, and this is what is more likely. For this Hadith did not mention anyone in it that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, taught him anything from the agreed-upon Sunan of prayer, so how could he have ordered him with this sitting? This is very remote indeed. He said: Then I found that Al-Bayhaqi mentioned this, and mentioned that there was disagreement regarding Abu Usamah about mentioning this second sitting after the two prostrations. He said: And the correct version from him is that he said after mentioning the two prostrations: Then rise until you stand up straight. Al-Bayhaqi said: And Al-Bukhari narrated it in his \"Sahih\" from Ishaq bin Mansur from Abu Usamah and mentioned the narration of Ibn Numair and did not mention Al-Bukhari's extraction of it, and Yahya bin Sa'id did not mention in his narration the second prostration nor what followed it of sitting or standing. He said: And standing is more similar to what the report was driven for, which is counting the pillars without the Sunan, and Allah knows best. Ibn Rajab said: This indicates that the mention of the second sitting is not preserved from Yahya.",

Ahmad attributed this to Omar, Ali, and Ibn Mas'ud, and Ibn Al-Mundhir mentioned it from Ibn Abbas. Al-Tirmidhi said: The practice is according to this among the people of knowledge. Among those who said this are: Ubadah bin Nasi, Abu Al-Zinad, Al-Nakha'i, Al-Thawri, Abu Hanifa, Al-Shafi'i in one of his two opinions, and Ahmad in the well-known view of his school among the generality of his companions.

Imam Ahmad mentioned in the narration of Abu Talib that no one from the people of Islam disagreed on that. It is the saying of the general scholars of the regions. A group held that he does not catch the Rak'ah by catching the Ruku' with the Imam; because he missed the standing and recitation of Al-Fatihah with the Imam. Al-Bukhari and Ibn Khuzayma went to this school, and this is an anomaly (Shudhudh) from the people of knowledge and opposition to their group.",

She said: He used to pray four in my house before Zuhr, then go out and lead the people in prayer, then enter and pray two Rak'ahs. And he used to lead the people in Maghrib prayer, then enter and pray two Rak'ahs. And he would lead the people in Isha prayer and enter my house and pray two Rak'ahs. And he used to pray nine Rak'ahs at night, including Witr. And he used to pray for a long time at night standing and for a long time sitting. And if he recited while standing, he would bow and prostrate while standing, and if he recited while sitting, he would bow and prostrate while sitting. And when Fajr rose, he would pray two Rak'ahs.\n4. \"Masa'il Abi Dawood\" (1876).",

End quote. Ibn Rajab said in \"Fath al-Bari\" 4/404: Ibn Mansur said: I said to Ahmad: If he looks around in prayer, does he repeat the prayer? He said: They have done wrong; I do not know that I have heard a Hadith regarding it that he repeats. As for looking around for the benefit of the prayer, like Abu Bakr looking around when the people clapped behind him, it does not invalidate the prayer. Our companions said: The looking around that invalidates is turning his neck, but if he turns his chest, his prayer is invalidated because he has left facing the Qiblah with most of his body, unlike if he turns with his face; for most of his body is facing the Qiblah. \n1.

He said: Qunut in Fajr is after bowing, and in Witr one chooses after bowing, but whoever performs Qunut before bowing, there is no harm; due to the action of the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and their difference (of opinion), but as for Fajr, it is after bowing (1).",

Ibn Rajab said in \"Al-Fath\" 6/275 after mentioning the differences upon Asim regarding the place of Qunut, he said: The narration of Asim from Anas regarding the place of Qunut and the implication of its permanence is confused [Mudtarib] and contradictory, and Asim himself was spoken about by Al-Qattan, and he used to consider him weak and did not narrate from him, and he said: He was not a Hafiz (preserver), so the narration of Asim from Anas, with its confusion, is not judged over the narrations of the companions of Anas; rather the matter is the opposite. And he quoted Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi in the book \"Al-Qunut\" saying: As for the Hadith of Asim Al-Ahwal from Anas, he was alone in his narration and the entirety of the companions of Anas contradicted him, so they narrated from him Qunut after bowing, and the judgment is for the group over the single individual. I say: Ibn al-Qayyim defended the authenticity of this Hadith in \"Zad al-Ma'ad\" 1/282.

He said: Rather, upon finishing the recitation. He said: And the sum of what came from Anas regarding that is that Qunut for a specific need (Nazilah) is after bowing, there is no disagreement from him regarding that, and as for other than a need, the correct view from him is before bowing, and there has been difference regarding that, and it appears that it is of the permissible difference.",

Narrated by Ahmad 2/98, he said: Aswad bin Amir told us, Baqiyyah bin al-Walid al-Homsi told us, from Uthman bin Zufar, from Hashim, from Ibn Umar who said: \"Whoever buys a garment for ten dirhams and in it is a forbidden dirham, Allah will not accept a prayer from him as long as it is upon him.\" He said: Then he put his fingers in his ears and said: Let them go deaf if I did not hear the Prophet (peace be upon him) say it.\n2. \"Fath al-Bari\" by Ibn Rajab 2/215, \"Nasb Al-Rayah\" 2/380, \"Al-Farusiyyah\" p. 197, \"Tanqih al-Tahqiq\" 1/304.\n3. \"Fath al-Bari\" by Ibn Rajab 2/216, \"Al-Farusiyyah\" p. 197. Benefit: Most scholars hold that acts of worship are not invalidated by committing what is forbidden if the prohibition is not specific to that act of worship. They are only invalidated by what is specific to the prohibition. Thus, prayer is invalidated by failure to purify for it, carrying impurity, and uncovering the Awrah even in seclusion, but it is not invalidated by looking at forbidden things in it, nor by misappropriating the property of others in it, and similar things where the prohibition is not specific to prayer. Likewise fasting, Hajj, I'tikaf, and others. Quoted from Ibn Rajab in \"Al-Fath\".",

And Ma'mar said: From Al-Zuhri, from Ibn Abi Su'air, from Jabir. It is Mudtarib (disturbed). Al-Hafiz defended this Hadith against Idtirab in \"Muqaddimat Al-Fath\" p. 374, saying: Al-Daraqutni stated absolutely that this Hadith is Mudtarib despite the possibility of negating Idtirab from it, by interpreting the ambiguous narrator in Sulayman's narration as the named one in Al-Layth's narration, and interpreting Ma'mar's narration that Al-Zuhri heard it from two Sheikhs. As for Al-Awza'i's Mursal narration, he shortened it by omitting the intermediary. This is the method of those who negate Idtirab from it. Al-Bukhari cited the difference in it, but he extracted Al-Awza'i's narration despite its disconnection because the Hadith with him is from Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, from Al-Layth and Al-Awza'i together, from Al-Zuhri. Al-Awza'i omitted Abdur-Rahman bin Ka'b, and Al-Layth affirmed him, and they are equal regarding Al-Zuhri, and they both declared hearing it from him, so Al-Layth's addition was accepted due to his trustworthiness. Then he said after that: And Sulayman bin Kathir narrated it from Al-Zuhri, from whoever heard Jabir. He intended by that to affirm the intermediary between Al-Zuhri and Jabir in general and to confirm Al-Layth's narration with that, and he did not see it as a defect necessitating Idtirab. As for Ma'mar's narration, Sufyan bin Uyainah agreed with him on it, narrating it from Al-Zuhri, from Ibn Abi Su'air, and said: Ma'mar confirmed me in it. So his narration returns to Ma'mar's narration. Regarding Al-Zuhri, there is another difference Al-Daraqutni did not mention; it was said: From Usamah bin Zaid, from Al-Zuhri, from Anas. From this path Abu Dawud and Al-Tirmidhi extracted it. Al-Tirmidhi quoted in \"Al-Ilal\" from Al-Bukhari that he said: Usamah's Hadith is a mistake he erred in - meaning the correct version involves Al-Layth's variation. Al-Hakim erred and extracted this Hadith of Usamah in his \"Mustadrak\". And regarding Al-Zuhri there is another difference, narrated by Al-Bayhaqi from the path of Abdur-Rahman bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Ansari, from Al-Zuhri, from Abdur-Rahman bin Ka'b bin Malik, from his father, which is also a mistake, and this Abdur-Rahman is weak. It is not hidden from the astute that Al-Layth's narration is the most likely of these narrations as we established, and that Al-Bukhari does not deem a Hadith defective merely due to difference.",

He said: \"Rather you are Bashir\" - he said: While I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), he passed by the graves of the polytheists and said: \"Indeed these have missed much good\" three times. Then he passed by the graves of the Muslims and said: \"Indeed these have attained much good.\" Then the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) glanced and saw a man walking among the graves wearing sandals. He said: \"O owner of the Sibtiyyah (tanned leather sandals), woe to you, throw off your Sibtiyyah.\" The man looked, and when he recognized the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), he took them off and threw them.\n2. \"Al-Mughni\" 2/423, \"Tanqih Al-Tahqiq\" 2/158-159. Issue: Ibn Qudamah said in \"Al-Mughni\" abridged: Most scholars do not see any harm in that. Jarir bin Hazim said: I saw Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin walking between graves in their sandals. Some argued using the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): \"When the servant is placed in his grave and his companions turn away from him, he indeed hears the tapping of their sandals\" narrated by Al-Bukhari. Abu Al-Khattab said: It seems that the Prophet (peace be upon him) only disliked walking in sandals for the man because of the pride in them, for Sibtiyyah sandals were the dress of the people of luxury. Al-Nawawi said: Its lowest state is recommendation because removing sandals is closer to humility and the dress of the people of modesty. The Prophet informing that the deceased hears the tapping of their sandals does not negate dislike, for it indicates the occurrence of this from them, and there is no dispute in its occurrence and their doing it despite its dislike. However, if the walker has an excuse preventing him from removing his sandals, such as thorns he fears for his feet or impurity touching them, walking in sandals is not disliked. Ahmad said regarding the man entering graveyards containing thorns while removing his sandals: This restricts people until the man walks on thorns. It was narrated from Ahmad that when he wanted to go out to a funeral, he wore his Khuff (leather socks) despite his command to remove sandals. See: \"Masa'il Ibn Hani\" (953).",

And in every forty Dinars is a Dinar.

And he said once: Nothing. Abu Hatim said: Weak in Hadith, Denounced (Munkar) in Hadith. Al-Daraqutni said: Abandoned (Matruk). Al-Nasa'i said: Not strong. Ibn Mahdi said: His Hadiths are few and contain denounced things. Abu Zur'ah said: There is something in his opinion, his place is truthfulness if Allah wills, Shu'bah abandoned him. Al-Juzajani said: A liar. It was said to Shu'bah: Why do you not narrate from Hakim bin Jubayr? He said: I fear the Fire. Benefit: Shu'bah abandoned him because of this Hadith. Meaning: That this Hadith is not established according to Shu'bah. Ibn Hibban said in \"Al-Majruhin\" 1/346 after mentioning his Hadith while denouncing it: It has no known path nor narration except from the Hadith of Hakim bin Jubayr. Also, Ibn Rajab quoted in \"Sharh 'Ilal al-Tirmidhi\" 197 Ibn Ma'in's denouncement of the Hadith of Zubaid and others. There is a supporting evidence for the text in \"Sahih Muslim\" (1040) from the path of Ibn Umar that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: \"Asking does not cease for one of you until he meets Allah with not a shred of flesh on his face.\" Issue: Al-Khattabi said in \"Ma'alim al-Sunan\" 2/48: As for defining the wealth with which charity becomes forbidden as fifty Dirhams, a group of the people of knowledge went to this view and saw it as the limit of wealth for whom charity is forbidden, among them Sufyan Al-Thawri, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Ahmad bin Hanbal, and Ishaq bin Rahwayh. Others refused to hold this view and weakened the Hadith for the defect mentioned by Yahya bin Adam, =",

They said: And there is nothing in the Hadith stating that whoever possesses fifty Dirhams, charity is not lawful for him; rather, it implies that he disliked it, and that is because asking is only for necessity, and there is no necessity for one who finds what suffices him for his time to ask. Malik and Al-Shafi'i said: There is no known limit for wealth; rather, the condition of the person is considered by his capacity and ability. If he suffices with what he has, charity is forbidden for him, and if he is in need, it is lawful for him. Al-Shafi'i said: A man might be rich with a Dirham due to earnings, while a thousand would not suffice him due to his weakness in himself and his large family. The scholars of opinion (Ashab al-Ra'y) set the limit at two hundred Dirhams, which is the Nisab (minimum amount) at which Zakat becomes obligatory. We were only commanded to take Zakat from the rich and give it to the poor, and this applies if it is established that he is rich possessing the Nisab upon which Zakat is obligatory on him, then he has exited the definition of the poor person who deserves to take Zakat. \n1. Narrated by Abu Dawood (1633), he said: Narrated to us Musaddad, narrated to us Isa bin Yunus, narrated to us Hisham bin Urwah, from his father, from Ubaydullah bin Adi bin Al-Khiyar, he said: Two men informed me that they came to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, during the Farewell Pilgrimage while he was distributing charity.

Abu Awanah said in his \"Sahih\": No one said in it: (from the Muslims) other than Malik and Al-Dahhak. But the narration of Umar bin Nafi' refutes him as well.

And Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, Za'idah, and Muhammad bin Bishr narrated it from him as connected (Mawsul). So the apparent meaning of Imam Ahmad's words is that those who narrated it as Mursal fell short in the chain, and those who narrated it as connected perfected the chain. Benefit: Al-Daraqutni found a defect in this Hadith in \"Al-Ilzamat wa Al-Tatabbu'\" (63) due to the Irsal (disconnection), where he said: The Hadith of Ismail, from Muhammad bin Sa'd, from his father: \"The month is like this...\" Yahya and Waki' narrated it as Mursal from Ismail. And Abu Hatim said in \"Al-'Ilal\" (754): The connected narration from Muhammad bin Sa'd, from his father, from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, is more likely; because the trustworthy narrators agreed upon it. I say: The addition from a trustworthy narrator may be accepted with contextual indicators; so for Imam Ahmad, it is not absolute.

I say: Perhaps it is: The two Hadiths are authentic [Sahih] with him, and the word: (Sahih) was dropped, and Allah knows best. I say: This Hadith is among those about which there has been much discussion. Al-Marwazi (87) quoted Yahya bin Ma'in saying about this Hadith: No report is established in it. Imam Ahmad said: This speech contains recklessness. Also, Ibn Abi Hatim quoted in \"Al-'Ilal\" number (732) from his father that he said: This Hadith to me is false [Batil]; perhaps he meant the path of Rafi' mentioned or the entire Hadith. And in \"Masa'il Abu Dawood from Ahmad\" (626), Abu Dawood said: Ahmad debated regarding cupping for the fasting person, so he argued with the reports of the Companions and did not argue with anything narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. And the statements of Imam Ahmad contradict each other regarding which is most authentic, and his contradiction regarding the Hadith of Rafi' bin Khadij. Al-Bukhari went to authenticating it as more than one quoted from him, then he turned away from it in his \"Jami'\" and did not include it in \"Al-Sahih\", and included the Hadith of Ibn Abbas which opposes it. Al-Tirmidhi quoted after (774) from Al-Shafi'i that he said: It has been narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, that he was cupped while fasting, and it has been narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, that he said: \"The cupper and the cupped have broken the fast,\" and I do not know either of these two Hadiths to be established. And Al-Bukhari, Ali bin Al-Madini, Al-Darimi, Ibn Rahwayh, and others authenticated this Hadith. I say: Sometimes the Imams apply 'Authenticity' to the jurisprudential practice, as Ibn Abd al-Barr said regarding the Hadith: \"Its water is purifying, its dead are lawful,\" and as Imam Ahmad said regarding the Hadith of the mouse falling into ghee; sometimes with the addition of detail if the ghee is solid or liquid, and sometimes without detail, he said: Both are authentic. As for the aspect of its Hadith narration, Ahmad does not accept such an addition, so his saying 'both are authentic' refers to the jurisprudential practice, and sometimes referring to a narrator in the chain, as Abu Hatim said in \"Al-'Ilal\" regarding the Hadith: \"Whoever performs ablution, well and good, and whoever performs Ghusl, then Ghusl =",

Imam Ahmad goes to it and speaks by it, and did not commit to its authenticity. What was narrated from him as Ibn Adi narrated in \"Al-Kamil\" in the biography of Sulaiman Al-Ashdaq with his chain to Ahmad bin Hanbal is that he said: The Hadiths of: \"The cupper and the cupped have broken the fast\" strengthen each other, and I hold this view. If he had anything authentic from them, he would have stopped at it. And his saying: The most authentic thing in this chapter is the Hadith of Rafi' does not imply its authenticity; rather its meaning is that it is less weak than others. The author of \"Al-Tanqih\" 2/319 said: Yahya bin Ma'in weakened this Hadith and said: It is a disturbed Hadith with no established Hadith in it.

Issue: Ibn Taymiyyah said in \"Al-Fatawa\" 25/252: More than one of the Companions disliked cupping for the fasting person, and some of them would not get cupped except at night. The people of Basra used to close the cuppers' shops when the month of Ramadan entered. The opinion that cupping breaks the fast is the school of the majority of the jurists of Hadith; like Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq bin Rahwayh, Ibn Khuzaimah, Ibn al-Mundhir, and others. Then Ibn Taymiyyah said in \"Al-Fatawa\" 25/254: For this reason, Muslim turned away from the Hadith that mentioned the cupping of the fasting person and did not affirm anything except the cupping of the Muhrim (person in Ihram). They interpreted the Hadiths of cupping with weak interpretations, such as their saying: They were backbiting, or their saying: He broke his fast for another reason. The best that has been said is what Ash-Shafi'i and others mentioned, that this is abrogated, for this statement was in Ramadan, and his cupping while in Ihram was after that; because Ihram is after Ramadan. This is also weak; rather, he (prayers of Allah be upon him) entered Ihram in the year six, the year of Hudaibiyah, for Umrah in Dhul-Qi'dah, and he entered Ihram the following year for Umrah al-Qada in Dhul-Qi'dah, and he entered Ihram in the third year, the year of the Conquest from Al-Ji'ranah in Dhul-Qi'dah for Umrah, and he entered Ihram in the tenth year for the Farewell Hajj in Dhul-Qi'dah. So his cupping (peace be upon him) while he was a Muhrim and fasting was not clarified in which of the Ihrams it was. What strengthens [the view] that his Ihram in which he was cupped was before the Conquest of Mecca is his saying: \"The cupper and the cupped have broken their fast,\" for it was during the year of the Conquest without a doubt, as it is in the best of Hadiths.

I say: Whoever tracks the sayings of Abu Hatim in \"Al-Ilal\" finds that this Hadith was mentioned once by inserting Abu Al-Ash'ath between Yahya bin Al-Harith and Abu Asma Ar-Rahabi, so Abu Hatim deemed this narration a delusion and said: The correct version is without it. Meaning: He applied 'authenticity' here to the preserved narration only, without looking at its chain. At-Tabarani found a defect in it in \"Al-Kabir\" in his narration of this Hadith and included it in the strange ones (Ghara'ib), and also Muslim's turning away from it strengthens what I went to regarding Abu Hatim applying 'authenticity' to the preserved narration even if it is weak, and Allah knows best.",

Similarly, the slave, if he performs Hajj in his slavery and is then freed, he must perform Hajj if he finds a way to do so, and what he performed during his slavery does not suffice.

And Abu Thawr, Ishaq bin Rahwayh, Abu Ubaid, and At-Tabari said the same, and it is the saying of the majority of the people of knowledge. Ahmad bin Hanbal and Dawud bin Ali went to the view that the annulment of Hajj into Umrah is permissible until today and established, and that whoever wishes to annul his Hajj into Umrah, if he is from those who did not drive the sacrificial animal (Hady), all of that is [permissible] for him, following the narrations reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) regarding that. Ahmad bin Hanbal said: Regarding the annulment of Hajj, there are established Hadiths that cannot be abandoned for the likes of the Hadith of Abu Dharr and the Hadith of Bilal bin Al-Harith, and their weakness. And he said: Who is Al-Muraqqa' bin Sayfi who narrates it from Abu Dharr? He said: And the annulment was narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him) from the Hadith of Jabir, Aisha, Asma bint Abi Bakr, Ibn Abbas, Abu Musa, Anas bin Malik, Sahl bin Hunaif, Abu Sa'id, Al-Bara' bin Azib, Ibn Umar, and Sabrah Al-Juhani. Ahmad said: Whoever enters Ihram for Hajj alone or combines Hajj with Umrah, if he wishes to make it an Umrah, he may exit [Ihram] and annul his Ihram into an Umrah; if he wishes he does so, and if he wishes he does not. Ahmad and those who followed his school also argued with his saying (peace be upon him): \"If I had known previously about my affair what I know now, I would not have driven the sacrificial animal and I would have made it an Umrah,\" and with the saying of Suraqah bin Ju'sham: O Messenger of Allah, teach us the teaching of a people who accepted Islam today; is this Umrah of ours for this year of ours or for forever? He said: \"Rather, for forever, rather for forever.\" Abu Umar [Ibn Abd al-Barr] said: There is no proof in this, because his saying (peace be upon him): \"If I had known previously about my affair what I know now, I would have made it an Umrah\"; its meaning is only 'I would have entered Ihram for Umrah and made my Ihram an Umrah to perform Tamattu' with it.'

He said: And indeed the first to introduce dragging the trails [of the garment] among the women of the Arabs was the mother of Isma'il. He said: When she fled from Sarah, she let down her trail to erase her tracks (1). Imam Ahmad said: Isma'il from Ayyub: 'I was informed' from Sa'id. And Ma'mar narrates it from Ayyub, from Sa'id, he did not say 'I was informed'. And Abu Awanah narrates it from Abu Bishr, from Sa'id bin Jubayr.

Scholars differed regarding that. Its prohibition was narrated from a group of Companions, and it is the view of most jurists.

And the meaning of his saying: \"The profit follows the responsibility\" is: The sold item, if it has income and yield, then the owner of the neck (the asset) - who is the guarantor of the original asset - owns the profit by guaranteeing the asset. So if a man buys land and occupies it, or livestock and breeds it, or a beast and rides it, or a slave and uses him, then finds a defect in him, he has the right to return the asset (neck), and he owes nothing for what he benefited from; because if it had perished between the time of the contract and the annulment, it would have been under the guarantee of the buyer. Thus, it was necessary that the profit belongs to him by right. The people of knowledge differed on this. Ash-Shafi'i said: Whatever occurred in the ownership of the buyer from yield, livestock offspring, or slave's child, all of that is the same; he returns nothing of it, and he returns the sold item if it has not decreased from what he took. And the People of Opinion (Ashab al-Ra'y) said: If it was livestock and he milked it, or palm trees or trees and he ate their fruit, he does not have the right to return it due to defect, but he returns for the compensation of the defect (Arsh). And they said regarding the house, the beast, the slave, and the yield: It belongs to him, and he returns due to defect. And Malik said regarding the wool of livestock and their hair: It belongs to the buyer and he returns the livestock to the seller, but as for their offspring, he returns them with the mothers.\n1.

And he said once: There is no proven Hadith from the Prophet (peace be upon him) regarding Istis'a (4). And once: I follow the Hadith of Ibn Umar (5), it is stronger than this and more correct in meaning (6). The Hadith of Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her): The husband of Barirah was a free man, so when she was freed, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) gave her the choice (7). Imam Ahmad said: What is correct regarding the husband of Barirah is that he was a slave (8). 497 - What came regarding veiling from the Mukatab (slave buying his freedom). The Hadith of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her): \"If one of you has a Mukatab and he has what [price] he can pay, let her veil herself from him\" (9).",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) Reported by Abu Dawud (3946), he said: Al-Hasan bin Ali narrated to us, Abdur-Razzaq narrated to us, Ma'mar informed us, from Az-Zuhri, from Salim, from Ibn Umar that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Whoever frees a share of his in a slave, what remains is freed from his wealth if he has enough to reach the price of the slave.\"\n2. \"Al-Mughni\" by Ibn Qudamah 14/359.\n3. The previous source.\n4. The previous source.\n5. Reported by Al-Bukhari (2523), he said: Ubaid bin Isma'il narrated to us from Abu Usamah, from Ubaidullah, from Nafi, from Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: \"Whoever frees a share of his in a slave, upon him is his complete freedom, if he has wealth that reaches his price. But if he does not have wealth, a fair value is assessed for him, and he frees from him what he freed.\"\n6. \"Masa'il Abdullah\" (1427). I say: The mention of Istis'a in this Hadith is disputed. Sa'id bin Abi Arubah, Jarir bin Hazim, Aban, Hajjaj bin Hajjaj, and Musa bin Khalaf narrated it from Qatada mentioning it. While Shu'bah, Hisham, and Hammam narrated it from Qatada without mentioning it. In Hammam's narration, he separated the Istis'a, making it from the speech of Qatada, not from the Hadith of Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (peace be upon him). It is known that the reliable companions of Qatada are Shu'bah, Sa'id bin Abi Arubah, Hisham, and Hammam, so the narration of the Companions is prioritized over those who oppose them. Al-Bardiji said in \"Sharh Ilal At-Tirmidhi\" by Ibn Rajab 2/504: If a Hadith of Sa'id bin Abi Arubah from Qatada from Anas as Marfu' is presented to you, and Hisham and Shu'bah oppose him, judgment is for Shu'bah and Hisham over Sa'id. I say: It is known that Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) accepts the addition from the trustworthy Hafiz from the companions of the Sheikh even if he opposes the rest of the companions, provided that the number of opposers is not large. Based on this rule, he used this Hadith as proof. Benefit: Ad-Daraqutni criticized this Hadith, as did Ibn Abd al-Barr in Al-Tamhid, Abu Mas'ud Ad-Dimashqi, Al-Asili, Ibn Al-Qassar, Al-Hakim in Ma'rifat Ulum al-Hadith, and others, as previously explained like the speech of Imam Ahmad, and it is the truth, if Allah wills. Al-Hafiz defended the authenticity of the Hadith in \"Al-Fath\", as did Ibn Al-Mawwaq, and the former is more likely, and Allah knows best. I say: The meaning of Istis'a in this Hadith is: The slave is tasked with earning and seeking until the value of the other partner's share is obtained; if he pays it to him, he becomes free. This is how the majority of those who advocate Istis'a interpreted it. Some said: It is that he serves his master who did not free him according to the portion of slavery he still has in him; according to this, the Hadiths agree.\n7. Reported by Ahmad 6/42, he said: Abu Mu'awiyah narrated to us, Al-A'mash narrated to us, from Ibrahim, from Al-Aswad, from Aisha who said: The husband of Barirah was a free man, so when she was freed - and he said once: became free - the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) gave her the choice, so she chose herself. She said: Her people wanted to sell her and stipulated the loyalty (Wala'). She said: So I mentioned that to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and he said: \"Buy her and free her, for the loyalty belongs to the one who frees.\"\n8. \"Masa'il Al-Kawsuj\" (1312).\n9. Reported by Ibn Majah (2520), he said: Abu Bakr bin Abi Shaybah narrated to us, Sufyan bin Uyainah narrated to us, from Az-Zuhri, from Nabhan the Mawla of Umm Salamah, from Umm Salamah that she reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: ...

She said: I will not eat except from the food that so-and-so (the girl) brought. He said: So she climbed onto a shelf of theirs, and looked at her achilles tendons, then she said: Kiss me, O my daughter. He said: So she started kissing her while smelling her mouth. He said: So she came back and informed (him). \n4. \"Al-Talkhis Al-Habir\" 3/147. \n5.

So I said: We gifted her to her husband. He said: \"Did you send with her a girl to beat the Duff and sing?\" She said: Say what? He said: \"She should say: We have come to you, we have come to you... So greet us and we greet you. Were it not for the red gold... She would not have settled in your valley. Nor the brown grain...

(1) Narrated by Al-Bukhari (5149), he said: Narrated to us Ali bin Abdullah, narrated to us Sufyan, I heard Abu Hazim say: I heard Sahl bin Sa'd Al-Sa'idi say: I was among the people with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, when a woman stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, she has gifted herself to you, so see your opinion regarding her. He did not answer her anything. Then she stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, she has gifted herself to you, so see your opinion regarding her. He did not answer her anything... The Hadith. \n2. \"Al-Wara'\" 119. Issue: Ibn Qudamah said in \"Al-Mughni\" 6/683 (paraphrased): As for teaching the Qur'an, the narration from Ahmad differed regarding making it a dowry. He said in one place: I dislike it. And he said in another place: There is no harm if he marries upon teaching a Surah from the Qur'an, or upon two sandals, and this is the school of Al-Shafi'i. Abu Bakr said: There are two sayings - meaning two narrations - in the issue. He said: And my choice is that it is not permissible, and this is the school of Malik, Al-Layth, Abu Hanifa, Makhul, and Ishaq. Those who permitted it argued with the Hadith of Sahl bin Sa'd Al-Sa'idi and in it... \"I have married her to you for what you have of the Qur'an\" agreed upon. The basis for the other narration: That private parts are not made permissible except with wealth; due to His saying, Exalted is He: {seek with your wealth}, and His saying: {And whoever among you cannot afford the means to marry free, believing women} and 'Al-Tawl' means wealth. And it has been narrated that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, married a man upon a Surah from the Qur'an, then said: \"It shall not be a dowry for anyone after you,\" narrated by Al-Najjad with his chain. And because teaching the Qur'an is not permissible to occur except as an act of worship for its doer, so it is not valid to be a dowry like fasting, prayer, and teaching faith. And because teaching differs between teacher and learner and can hardly be regulated; so it resembled something unknown. As for the Hadith of gifting, it has been said: Its meaning is I married her to you for what you have of the Qur'an, meaning I married her to you; because you are of the people of the Qur'an, just as he married Abu Talha upon his Islam. Ibn Abd Al-Barr narrated with his chain from Anas that Abu Talha married Umm Sulaim upon his Islam. And there is no mention of teaching in the authentic Hadith. It is possible that it was specific to that man, evidenced by what Al-Najjad narrated, and there is no branching upon this narration. As for the other (view), it is necessary to specify what he teaches her, either a specific Surah or Surahs or specific verses because Surahs differ and likewise verses. I say: Perhaps Imam Ahmad intended the jurisprudential aspect in his comment on the Hadith, and Allah knows best.",

(1) Narrated by Ibn Majah (1885), he said: Narrated to us Al-Hussein bin Mahdi, informed us Abdul Razzaq, informed us Ma'mar, from Thabit, from Anas bin Malik, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said... The Hadith. \n2. \"'Ilal Al-Marwazi\" (266). \n3. \"Sharh 'Ilal Al-Tirmidhi\" 393. I say: The text of the Hadith is established, for Al-Bukhari narrated it (5112) from the Hadith of Nafi', from Ibn Umar: That the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, forbade Shighar. And Shighar is: That a man marries off his daughter on the condition that the other marries his daughter to him, with no dowry between them. Issue: Al-Khattabi said in \"Ma'alim Al-Sunan\" 3/164: The interpretation of Shighar is what Nafi' explained. He said: If the marriage occurs in this description, is it invalid? Because the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, forbade it, and the origin of sexual relations is prohibition, and prohibition is not lifted by prohibition, but is lifted by permissibility. The jurists did not differ that the Prophet's prohibition of marrying a woman along with her paternal aunt or maternal aunt implies forbiddance, and likewise his prohibition of Mut'ah marriage, so likewise this. Among those who invalidated this marriage are Malik, Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq bin Rahwayh, and Abu Ubaid. The scholars of opinion and Sufyan Al-Thawri said: The marriage is valid and for each of them is a dowry of her like, and the meaning of the prohibition in this according to them is making the private parts lawful without a dowry. \n4. Narrated by Al-Bukhari (5115), he said: Narrated to us Malik bin Ismail, narrated to us Ibn Uyainah that he heard Al-Zuhri say: Informed me Al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Ali and his brother Abdullah from their father that Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said to Ibn Abbas...

They said: And no one says this except Malik from Nafi' from Ibn Umar in this chapter. Ubaidullah bin Umar narrated it from Nafi' from Ibn Umar, that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, invoked mutual curses between a man and his wife and separated them. And thus everyone who narrated it from Nafi' narrated it, they mentioned the mutual cursing and the separation, and they did not mention that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, joined the child to the woman. But Malik said it from Nafi' as you saw, and Malik is sufficient in memorization and precision. A group of the Imams of Hadith have said: Malik is more established in Nafi' and Ibn Shihab than others. And this wording: And join the child to its mother or to the woman, which they claimed Malik was alone in, is also preserved from other aspects: Among them is that Ibn Wahb mentioned in his \"Muwatta\", he said: Yunus informed me, from Ibn Shihab, from Sahl bin Sa'd Al-Sa'idi, he said: I attended their mutual cursing before the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, while I was fifteen years old, and he narrated the Hadith.

Rather, the apparent prohibition is that mourning is not permissible. He answered that this Hadith is irregular (Shadh) and contrary to the authentic Hadiths, and they have agreed on contradicting it. Al-Hafiz said: Al-Bayhaqi found fault with the Hadith due to disconnection, saying: The hearing of Abdullah bin Shaddad from Asma' is not established.

(1) Reported by Al-Hakim 1/570, he said: Abu Ali Al-Husain bin Ali Al-Hafiz narrated to us, Abdan Al-Ahwazi informed us, Nasr bin Ali Al-Jahdami narrated to us, Al-Harith bin Murrah narrated to us, Asal bin Sufyan narrated to us, from Ibn Abi Mulaykah, from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) raised to the Prophet.\n2. \"Ilal Al-Marudhi\" (256), \"Al-Muntakhab min Al-Ilal lil-Khallal\" (46). I say: As for the text, Al-Bukhari reported it (7527) from the path of Az-Zuhri, from Abu Salamah, from Abu Hurairah raised to the Prophet with the wording: \"He is not of us who does not chant the Quran.\" However, Ad-Daraqutni in \"Al-Ilzamat wa At-Tatabbu'\" (170) criticized this Hadith, saying: It is said that Abu Asim was deluded in it, and the correct version is what Az-Zuhri, Muhammad bin Ibrahim, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, Muhammad bin Amr, and others narrated from Abu Salamah, from Abu Hurairah, from the Prophet (peace be upon him): \"Allah has not listened to anything as He listens to a Prophet with a beautiful voice chanting the Quran, reciting it aloud.\" And Abu Asim's saying is a delusion. Uqayl, Yunus, Amr bin Al-Harith, Amr bin Dinar, Amr bin Atiyyah, Ishaq bin Rashid, Ma'mar and others narrated it from Az-Zuhri contrary to what Abu Asim narrated from Ibn Jurayj with the wording we previously mentioned. Ibn Jurayj only narrated this wording which Abu Asim mentioned from him with another chain narrated from Ibn Abi Mulaykah, from Abu Nahik, from Sa'id; Ibn Uyainah said it from him. Al-Khatib said in \"Tarikh Baghdad\" 1/295 with modification: And Abu Asim's saying in it: \"He is not of us who does not chant the Quran\" is a delusion from Abu Asim; because of the large number of those who narrated it from him like that. Likewise, Al-Awza'i, Amr bin Al-Harith, Muhammad bin Al-Walid Az-Zubaidi, Shu'aib bin Abi Hamzah, Ma'mar bin Rashid, Uqayl bin Khalid, Yunus bin Yazid, Ubaidullah bin Abi Ziyad, Ishaq bin Rashid, Mu'awiyah bin Yahya As-Sadafi, and Al-Walid bin Muhammad Al-Waqari narrated it from Az-Zuhri, and they all agreed, including Ibn Jurayj, that its wording is: \"Allah has not listened to anything as He listens to a Prophet chanting the Quran.\" Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" 13/511: The Hadith is one, except that some of them narrated it with the wording \"Allah has not listened...\" and some narrated it with \"He is not of us...\". I say: What appears to me is that this Hadith has been criticized, and Allah knows best. Issue: Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" 8/688-689: Ibn Al-Jawzi said: They differed regarding the meaning of his saying 'yataghanna' on four views: First: Beautifying the voice. Second: Being self-sufficient (Istighna). Third: Becoming sad/sorrowful, said by Ash-Shafi'i. Fourth: Occupying oneself with it; the Arabs say 'taghanna' in a place meaning he stayed there. I [Al-Hafiz] say: There is another view narrated by Ibn Al-Anbari in \"Al-Zahir\", he said: The meaning is finding pleasure and sweetness in it just as the people of music find pleasure in singing, so it was termed 'taghanni' because he does at it what is done at singing. At-Tabari mentioned from Ash-Shafi'i that he was asked about Ibn Uyainah's interpretation of 'taghanni' as 'Istighna' (self-sufficiency), and he did not approve of it and said: If he meant self-sufficiency, he would have said 'lam yastaghni' (does not seek sufficiency), but rather he meant beautifying the voice.",

Issue: Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" 8/702-703: Iyad found problematic the statement of Ibn Abbas: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed away when I was ten years old\" due to what preceded in the [Book of] Prayer from another perspective that he was nearing puberty during the Farewell Pilgrimage.

Al-Isma'ili preceded in noting this difficulty, saying: The Hadith of Az-Zuhri, from Ubaidullah, from Ibn Abbas which passed in Prayer is a delusion. Iyad answered that it is possible his saying: (I was ten years old) refers to memorizing the Quran, not to the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and the estimated meaning would be: \"He died while I had gathered the Muhkam and I was ten years old.\" So there is a shifting of words.

Imam Ahmad said: When asked about cupping on Saturday, he said: I prefer that it be avoided, due to the Hadith of Az-Zuhri, even though it is Mursal.

Physicians hold that the most beneficial cupping is what occurs in the second or third hour, and that it should not occur after evacuation from intercourse, bath, or otherwise, nor after satiety or hunger. Then he quoted from Ahmad that he used to get cupped at any time the blood became agitated and at any hour it was. Al-Hafiz said: Physicians have agreed that cupping is [best] in its [the month's] beginning and end. I say: Among those who weakened the mentioned Hadiths regarding the time of cupping are Al-Uqayli in \"Ad-Du'afa\" and Abu Zur'ah Ar-Razi, and they said: Nothing is established regarding it.",

I say: Ad-Daraqutni and others criticized the Hadiths of wearing a ring on the right hand. He said in \"At-Tatabbu'\" 460 regarding the preserved Hadith of Anas from Yunus, Al-Layth, Ibn Wahb, and Uthman bin Umar narrated it - meaning: there was disagreement regarding Yunus. Al-Layth, Ibn Wahb, and Uthman bin Umar narrated it from him without mentioning the right hand, while Talha bin Yahya and Sulayman bin Bilal narrated it from him mentioning it. Ad-Daraqutni preferred not mentioning it, and it is stronger. Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" 10/340 with modification: Ibn Abi Hatim said: I asked Abu Zur'ah about the difference in Hadiths regarding that, so he said: Neither this nor that is established, but 'on his right' is more frequent. He said: There is disagreement among the Shafi'is regarding the issue, and the more correct view is the right hand. I [Al-Hafiz] say: It appears to me that this varies according to the intention. If the wearing is for adornment, then the right hand is better. If it is for sealing (using as a signet), then the left hand is more appropriate; because it is like putting it in deposit, and taking it from there happens with the right hand, and likewise putting it back. Wearing it on the right hand is preferred absolutely; because the left hand is the tool for cleaning oneself, so the ring is protected if it is on the right hand from being touched by impurity. And wearing it on the left hand is preferred based on what I indicated regarding taking it. A group leaned towards the equality of both matters and combined the various Hadiths by this. Abu Dawud indicated this where he titled a chapter: Chapter of Wearing a Ring on the Right and Left, then he listed the Hadiths with their variation in that without preference. An-Nawawi and others reported consensus on permissibility then said: There is no dislike in it - meaning: according to the Shafi'is - but the difference is regarding what is better. Al-Baghawi said: The last of the two matters was wearing the ring on the left. At-Tabari critiqued this saying its apparent meaning is abrogation, and that is not his intent, but rather reporting the reality by agreement. What appears is that the wisdom in it is what was mentioned earlier, and Allah knows best.",

She mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and he said: \"Do not let that prevent you, for Wala' belongs to the one who freed.\"\n3. \"Sharh Ilal At-Tirmidhi\" by Ibn Rajab (238), \"Ilal Al-Marudhi\" (450), \"Bahr al-Dam\" (520).\n4. \"Masa'il Al-Kawsuj\" (3169). Benefit: Ibn Rajab said in \"Sharh Ilal At-Tirmidhi\" 239: And Nafi' narrated from Ibn Umar from his own saying: The prohibition of selling Wala' and gifting it, not raised (Marfu'). This is among the things that defect the Hadith of Abdullah bin Dinar. And Allah knows best. Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" 12/44-45 with modification: This Hadith became famous from Abdullah bin Dinar, to the point that Muslim said in his \"Sahih\": People regarding this Hadith are dependent on Abdullah bin Dinar. At-Tirmidhi said after extracting it: Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Abdullah bin Dinar. It is narrated from Shu'bah that he said: I wished that when Abdullah bin Dinar narrated this Hadith to me, he had permitted me so I could stand up to him and kiss his head. And in \"Musnad At-Tayalisi\" from Shu'bah: I said to Abdullah bin Dinar: Did you hear this from Ibn Umar? He said: Yes, his son asked him about it. Abu Awanah mentioned it from Bahz bin Asad from Shu'bah: I said to Ibn Dinar: Did you hear it from Ibn Umar? He said: Yes, and his son Hamzah asked him about it. The same occurred in the narration of Affan from Shu'bah with Abu Nu'aym. It was extracted from another path that Shu'bah said: I said to Ibn Dinar: By Allah, did you hear Ibn Umar say this? So he swore to him. It was said to Ibn Uyainah: Shu'bah makes Abdullah bin Dinar swear. He said: But we did not make him swear; I heard it from him repeatedly. Ibn Al-Arabi said in \"Sharh At-Tirmidhi\": Abdullah bin Dinar was unique in this Hadith, and it is of the second degree of report; because he did not mention the wording of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and it is as if he conveyed the meaning of the Prophet's saying (peace be upon him): \"Wala' belongs only to the one who freed.\" I say: This is supported by the fact that Ibn Umar narrated this Hadith from Aisha in the story of Barirah, but the wording of the Hadith came from him via another path extracted by An-Nasa'i and Abu Awanah from the path of Al-Layth from Yahya bin Ayyub, from Malik, with the wording: I heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbidding the sale of Wala' and gifting it. Issue: Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" 12/45: Ibn Battal said: The scholars agreed that transferring lineage is not permissible, so if the ruling of Wala' is like lineage, then just as lineage is not transferred, Wala' is not transferred. In Jahiliyyah, they used to transfer Wala' by sale and other means, so the Sharia forbade that. Ibn Abd al-Barr said: The community agreed on acting upon this Hadith except what was narrated from Maimunah that she gifted the Wala' of Sulayman bin Yasar to Ibn Abbas. And Abdur-Razzaq narrated from Ibn Jurayj, from Ata: It is permissible for the master to permit his slave to take as Wala' whom he wishes.",

Sulayman bin Musa has Munkar narrations and is closer to weakness than to reliability; hence Abu Dawud denounced it. According to the method of Imam Ahmad, this Hadith would be Munkar, and Allah knows best.",

So Sa'id said: Does it have a market? He said: Yes, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, informed me: \"That the people of Paradise, when they enter it, will settle in it according to the virtue of their deeds. Then permission is given for the duration of a Friday from the days of the world, so they visit their Lord. He reveals His Throne to them and appears to them in a garden from the gardens of Paradise. Pulpits of light, pulpits of pearls, pulpits of ruby, pulpits of chrysolite, pulpits of gold, and pulpits of silver are placed for them. The lowest of them - and there is no low one among them - sits on mounds of musk and camphor, and they do not see that the owners of the chairs are in a better seating position than them.\" Abu Huraira said: I said: O Messenger of Allah? And will we see our Lord? He said: \"Yes. He said: Do you doubt in seeing the sun and the moon on the night of the full moon?\" We said: No. He said: \"Likewise, you will not doubt in seeing your Lord. And no man will remain in that gathering except that Allah will speak to him directly, until He says to a man among them: O so-and-so son of so-and-so, do you remember the day you said such and such? So He reminds him of some of his betrayals in the world. So he says: Yes, O Lord, did You not forgive me? He says: Yes, it is by the vastness of My forgiveness that you reached this station of yours. While they are like that, a cloud covers them from above and rains perfume on them, the likes of whose scent they have never found before. And our Lord, Blessed and Exalted, says: Rise to what I have prepared for you of honor and take what you desire. So we come to a market surrounded by angels; in it is what eyes have not looked upon the likes of, nor ears heard, nor has occurred to hearts. So what we desire is carried to us. There is no buying or selling in it. In that market, the people of Paradise meet one another. He said: A man of high status comes and meets one who is lower than him - and there is no low one among them - so he is impressed by the clothing he sees on him. His conversation does not end until he imagines that he has something better than it on him. That is because it is not befitting for anyone to grieve in it. Then we return to our dwellings, and our wives meet us and say: Welcome and hail, you have come and indeed you have more beauty than when you left us. So he says: Indeed, we sat today with our Lord, the Compeller, and we deserve to return as we have returned.\"",

So Al-Humaidi and the people of Mecca jumped on him and spoke harsh words to him. So he apologized afterwards, but it was not accepted from him, and people renounced him afterwards.

Or something like that, except that he said: Ibn Al-Himmani, there is no analogy for him now. Then he said: Glory be to the One who veils whom He wills. And I saw him extremely angry with him. 9 - And in \"Masa'il Abi Dawud\" (1884) Ahmad said: Sufyan narrated the Hadith of Abu Al-Ahwas regarding major sins, from Abu Al-Ahwas, from Abdullah.

    "foot_note": "1. = I say: The mention of striving in this Hadith is disputed. Sa'id bin Abi Arubah, Jarir bin Hazim, Aban, Hajjaj bin Hajjaj, and Musa bin Khalaf narrated it from Qatada mentioning it. Shu'bah, Hisham, and Hammam narrated it from Qatada without mentioning it. In Hammam's narration, he separated the striving, making it from the speech of Qatada, not from the Hadith of Abu Huraira from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. It is known that the reliable companions of Qatada are Shu'bah, Sa'id bin Abi Arubah, Hisham, and Hammam. The narration of the companions is prioritized over those who oppose them. Al-Bardiji said in \"Sharh Ilal al-Tirmidhi\" by Ibn Rajab 2/504: If a Hadith of Sa'id bin Abi Arubah from Qatada from Anas is presented to you as Marfu', and Hisham and Shu'bah oppose him, judgment is for Shu'bah and Hisham over Sa'id. I say: It is known that Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him, accepts the addition from a reliable Hafiz from the Sheikh's companions even if he opposes the rest of the companions, provided the number of opponents is not large. Based on this rule, he used this Hadith as proof. Benefit: Al-Daraqutni criticized this Hadith, as did Ibn Abd al-Barr in Al-Tamhid, Abu Mas'ud al-Dimashqi, Al-Asili, Ibn al-Qassar, Al-Hakim in Ma'rifat Ulum al-Hadith, and others with what was previously explained like the words of Imam Ahmad, and it is the truth, Allah willing. Al-Hafiz defended the authenticity of the Hadith in \"Al-Fath\", as did Ibn al-Mawwaq, and the first view is more likely, and Allah knows best. I say: The meaning of striving in this Hadith: The slave is tasked with earning and seeking until he obtains the value of the other partner's share; once he pays it to him, he becomes free. This is how the majority of those who uphold striving interpreted it. Some said: It is that he serves his master who did not free him according to the proportion of slavery he still holds in him. Based on this, the Hadiths agree.\n1. Recorded by Ahmad 6/42, he said: Abu Mu'awiyah told us, Al-A'mash told us, from Ibrahim, from Al-Aswad, from Aisha who said: The husband of Barirah was free, so when she was freed—and he said once: she became free—the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave her the choice, and she chose herself. She said: Her people wanted to sell her and stipulated the Wala'. She said: I mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said: \"Buy her and free her, for the Wala' belongs to the one who frees.\"",

He said in one place: I dislike it. And he said in another place: There is no harm in marrying on the condition of teaching a Surah of the Quran, or for two sandals, and this is the school of Al-Shafi'i. Abu Bakr said: There are two sayings in the issue—meaning two narrations. He said: My choice is that it is not permissible, and it is the school of Malik, Al-Layth, Abu Hanifa, Makhul, and Ishaq. Those who permitted it argued with the Hadith of Sahl bin Sa'd Al-Sa'idi, and in it... \"I have married you to her for what you have of the Quran,\" agreed upon. The basis of the other narration: Private parts are not made lawful except with wealth; due to His saying, Exalted be He: {that you seek with your wealth}, and His saying: {And whoever among you cannot [find] the means to marry free, believing women} and \"Taul\" means wealth. It has been narrated that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, married a man for a Surah of the Quran, then said: \"It shall not be a dowry for anyone after you,\" recorded by Al-Najjad with his chain. And because teaching the Quran is not permissible to occur except as an act of worship by the doer, so it is not valid to be a dowry like fasting, prayer, and teaching faith. And because teaching differs between the teacher and the student and can hardly be determined; so it resembled something unknown. As for the Hadith of gifting, it has been said: Its meaning is 'I married you to her due to what you have of the Quran', i.e., I married you to her because you are from the people of the Quran, just as he married Abu Talha for his Islam. Ibn Abd al-Barr narrated with his chain from Anas that Abu Talha married Umm Sulaym for his Islam. And there is no mention of teaching in the authentic Hadith. It is possible that it was specific to that man, evidenced by what Al-Najjad narrated. There is no branching on this narration. As for the other (permissive) one, what he teaches her must be specified, either a specific Surah, or Surahs, or specific verses, because Surahs differ and so do verses. I say: Perhaps Imam Ahmad intended the jurisprudential aspect in his statement on the Hadith, and Allah knows best.",

Because the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade it, and the origin of private parts is prohibition, and prohibition is not lifted by prohibition, but is lifted by permission. The jurists did not disagree that the Prophet's prohibition of marrying a woman along with her paternal aunt or maternal aunt implies prohibition, and likewise his prohibition of Mut'ah marriage, so likewise this.

Issue: Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\" 9/218-219 (adapted): Ibn Abd al-Barr said: There is no disagreement among scholars that one does not perform Azl with a free wife except with her permission; because intercourse is her right, and she has the right to demand it, and known intercourse is only that which is not followed by Azl. Ibn Hubayrah agreed with him on this consensus. It was critiqued that the well-known view among the Shafi'is is that the woman has no right to intercourse at all. However, the three schools agreed that a free woman is not subject to Azl except with her permission, and that a slave woman is subject to Azl without her permission.",
