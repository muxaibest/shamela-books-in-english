    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nPreface\nThe second century AH witnessed the emergence of the Sufi movement, when people began turning away from the straight path of being mindful of Allah, fearing Him, remembering Him secretly and openly, and renouncing the world. A group of righteous people were alarmed by people's fierce competition for the world and their racing to indulge in pleasures and amusements. So they withdrew aside, turning to the Truth, Glory be to Him, devoting themselves to worship, reciting the Book of Allah, and standing in prayer at night, performing Tahajjud and Tahlil (saying La ilaha illa Allah) secretly and openly.\nA group of these people took it upon themselves to clarify the practical conduct of Sufism. Al-Muhasibi described the behavior of Sufis in a scientific manner in his book \"Al-Ri'ayah li-Huquq Allah\" (Observance of the Rights of Allah). The ways of Sufism until the sixth century AH were generally close to asceticism (Zuhd), despite some deviations from the right path that mixed with it at times. However, the grave events that befell the Islamic state since the late sixth century AH and early seventh century AH created an opposite reaction. Some turned away from life and its affairs and leaned towards fatalism (Tawakul), and asceticism in their customs became a kind of indifference reaching the point of submissiveness.",

    "text": "The beginning was when the Ayyubids resolved to confront the Shiite current of thought following the collapse of the Fatimid state. The Ayyubids established numerous schools and Hadith houses in Egypt and the Levant, and summoned Sunni scholars and jurists to play their role in those institutions. Many Islamic cities such as Alexandria, Cairo, Qus, Asyut, Jerusalem, Aleppo, Damascus, and Tripoli became vibrant centers for Sunni sciences and thought.\nThen came the fierce Crusader invasion to add other burdens, casting its weight on Saladin. He worked to establish the Arab and Islamic identity of the lands that were the target of the new invaders. He established Khanqahs (Sufi hospices), Ribats (hospices/fortresses), Zawiyas (corners), and Tekkes, in addition to mosques, schools, Hadith houses, and hospitals (Bimaristans). Saladin's goal behind this was to revive religious feeling among Muslims and raise the readiness of the Islamic nation to resist the dangers threatening it.\nA group of people occupied these places, taking up Dhikr (remembrance) and reading the Quran as their profession. They followed the straight path and were good models for the pious and worshippers. However, these places soon became a refuge and sanctuary for every comfort seeker, finding therein what they sought of food, clothing, and drink without significant effort. This was followed by an increase in the numbers of those joining the ranks of Sufism, especially after the number of Khanqahs, Ribats, Zawiyas, and Tekkes multiplied, and people exaggerated in endowing Waqfs (religious endowments) for them, and Sultans, Princes, and the wealthy competed in offering money and gifts to their frequenters. Thus, the life of the Sufis became easy, and they enjoyed a luxurious and opulent life, which led to the spread of innovations later on.\nConsequently, claiming to be Sufi became common for the purpose of livelihood. Many headed to the Khanqahs, wore wool, and shaved their heads, but they did not adopt the morals of",

They said: \"We seek refuge in Allah from the Fire, and from the Sufi if he knows the door of the house.\" Another description of their condition was: \"Eaters, idle, hashish addicts (Satla), having no work or occupation.\" Many jurists defined the group of Sufis as \"men who display Islam but conceal corrupt belief, wearing skulls on their legs and their turbans' tails from the front\" (1).\nWhat increased the rushing of groups of people to join the ranks of Sufism was the occurrence of the devastating Tartar-Mongol invasion of the Islamic world, and the bitterness and disappointment it bequeathed in souls. Also, the hardship of living that characterized that era due to drought and famine, so famines persisted, and infectious diseases like plague and smallpox and other deadly diseases spread.\nThese people found in the Khanqahs ample living and ease of condition, indeed luxury in food, drink, and clothing. This is because many interests and establishments, such as orchards, shops, bathhouses, and markets, were endowed (Waqf) for the Sufis. The Sa'id al-Su'ada Khanqah in Egypt, established in 569 AH = 1173 AD, had a number of interests endowed to it to spend from their revenue on the poor Sufis, including the Habbaniyah orchard and the Sharab Qaysariyah (market). Each Sufi there was allocated three loaves weighing a third of a Ratl in broth, and sweets were made for its Sufis every month, and soap was distributed to them (2). As for the Sufis of the Rukn al-Din Baybars Khanqah, a kitchen was attached to it, from which meat, food, and three loaves were distributed to the residents every day, in addition to",

This is besides the sugar, various drinks, and types of medicines available in the Khanqah. Bathhouses, kitchens, and burial places were also attached to the Khanqahs, and their floors were spread with carpets, copper utensils, books, lamps, and other precious tools, which only kings and princes acquire.\nAnyone who looks at the endowment deeds of Khanqahs, Zawiyas, and Ribats realizes the extent of the economic burden suffered by society due to the narrow base benefiting from the economic interests restricted to Sufis to the exclusion of other segments of society.\nAs evidence of the extravagant and luxurious life enjoyed by the Sufis, we present two examples of Sama' (Sufi musical gatherings) held in Egypt and the Levant in the year 659 AH = 1261 AD.\n\"Mawla Qutb al-Din, may Allah have mercy on him, said: One of the Nasiriyyah narrated to me, saying: When we entered the Egyptian lands, it happened that one of the senior Emirs held a Sama', and he came himself to Emir Jamal al-Din and invited him. He promised him to go to him and attend. When it was the time of the last Isha prayer, he went, and we were with him - a group of his Mamluks and retinue - to that Emir's house. When he entered, he found a group of Emirs sitting in the Iwan of the house, and a group of Fuqara (Sufis) in the middle of the house. He stopped and did not enter, and said to the owner of the house: You erred in what you did. The Fuqara should have been seated above and you",

When the singer sang, one of them stood up with the tambourine in his hand begging. This was the custom of singers in the Egyptian lands. When Emir Jamal al-Din saw him, he scolded him and said: Woe to you.\"\nThe narration continues explaining the condition of the Sufis as they danced and collected gold and silver coins from the Emirs, then eating the most delicious food and drink (1), and leaving happy and joyful.\nQutb al-Din al-Yunini in his \"Dhayl\" (Supplement) to \"Mir'at al-Zaman\" by Sibt ibn al-Jawzi also provided a detailed presentation describing one of those dancing nights. It came in the biography of Lajin bin Abdullah, Emir Husam al-Din al-Jukandari (d. 662 AH / 63 - 1264 AD), where he said: \"...He had a good belief in Fuqara (Sufis) and righteous people, and frequently did good to them and was kind to them, checking on them with spending, clothing, and other things. He used to hold Sama' gatherings for them, bringing in foods, drinks, good perfumes, and candles that dazzle the mind and exceed the limit. It was estimated that what he spent on a single Sama' was approximately eight thousand Dirhams (2)... etc.\nAl-Yunini proceeds to describe a Sama' night he himself attended in Lajin's house located in Al-Uqaybah in Damascus in late 659 AH.

In each bowl was a whole suckling lamb, and about three hundred bowls in each of which were three chickens, and other types of food. After Isha and completing the prayer, those present began singing and dancing. When they got tired, he spread a table of sweets and Qatayef (pancakes), fresh and fried, made with Egyptian sugar, pistachios, and musk. Then they danced and sang all together. Then, a huge table of rare fruits out of season was spread, including quince, apples, pears, pomegranates, and melons. After that, they returned to dancing and singing. Then he spread a table of various nuts, Iraqi sugarcane, pistachios, hazelnuts, raisins, stuffed cakes, Khushkanan (discs of flour and sweets), rusks, and others. Their drink was made with snow and sugar, willow water (a type of distilled Egyptian willow), and rose water, in addition to censers filled with aloeswood, ambergris, and Indian oud. When it was the time of Suhur (pre-dawn), they entered a bathhouse adjacent to Lajin's house, bathed, and were dressed in new shirts and clothes. After the bath, they returned to the house and were given drinks suitable after a bath, then a table of hot sweets was spread for them, and after that they left.\nTo estimate the condition of the people at that time, Al-Yunini commented on the occurrence of this Sama', stating that it was held while people were in hardship.

Consequently, the state recognized Sufi institutions and brought Sufi sheikhs close, to the extent that Sultans boasted of building Ribats, Khanqahs, and Zawiyas for the Sufi group, believing that the poor Sufis could perform miracles, remove harm from Sultans, and claim unveiling (Mukashafa) and witnessing the Truth (1). Therefore, the poor Sufis were often invited to lift harm from an afflicted person, or to pray for wellness for a sick person (2).\nThe influence of the Sheikh of Sheikhs of the Sa'id al-Su'ada Khanqah reached such an extent that he succeeded in banishing Ibn Taymiyyah from Egypt to the Levant in the year 707 AH = 1307 AD, where he was imprisoned in Damascus, on the pretext of speaking against the Sheikhs of the Path (Tariqa). The Sheikh of Sa'id al-Su'ada had gathered over five hundred Sufis from the Khanqah and marched with them in a demonstration to the Citadel, and large groups of commoners had joined the demonstration. At the Citadel, they complained to the Sultan about Ibn Taymiyyah, who referred them to the Shafi'i judge, who pushed them away to Taqi al-Din Ali bin al-Zawawi al-Maliki, who in turn issued the ruling we referred to (3). Also in Damascus, Ibn Ramadan the Witness was reprimanded because he spoke against the Fuqara (4), and was beaten until he sought repentance and forgiveness.

Furthermore, some Sufis never established prayer at all, claiming that they only perform it in sacred places (2).\nCorruption pervaded the life of Sufis in their habits, morals, customs, traditions, clothes, costumes, drinks, and foods. The pretenders among the Sufis became famous for greed in eating and drinking, fondness for dancing, and rushing to Sama' and singing.

In their definition, Sama' generates a state in the heart called Wajd (ecstasy), and this in turn moves the body members. If the movements are rhythmic, they are clapping and dancing; if unweighted, they are agitations (1). It seems that a kind of whim and overpowering control the Sufi; if he hears singing or a rhythmic beat with a stick, he goes into ecstasy, claps, and perhaps tears his clothes and throws them (2).\nA group of scholars denounced such disgraceful behavior and wrote books and poems condemning their conduct. Imam Muwaffaq al-Din, Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Qudamah al-Maqdisi wrote a treatise condemning what the pretenders of Sufism do of singing, dancing, going into ecstasy, beating the tambourine, listening to flutes, and raising voices objectionably with what they call Dhikr (remembrance) and Tahlil, claiming it is a type of closeness to Allah Almighty.\nMany poets satirized them, such as Shaddad bin Ibrahim nicknamed Al-Tahir Al-Jazari, and the Dean Abu Muhammad Abdullah, Ahmad bin Ibrahim Al-Zawawi the scribe, and Zahir al-Din the judge of Salamiyah d. 610 AH = 1213 AD (3), who satirized Makki, the Sheikh of the Fuqara Zawiya in Bawazij, a small town near Salamiyah, saying: [Mutaqarib Meter]\nTell Makki the advice of a sincere advisor ...

It seems that incident took place on the first day of the fast, or the first Sunday of the fast according to Al-Shabushti's narration in Al-Diyarat (1), and that day became a celebration for them where men mix with women.\nIbn al-Jawzi pointed out that the Sufis of his time had closed the door of looking at foreign women upon themselves, due to their distance from associating with them and their refraining from mixing with them, and busied themselves with worship instead of marriage. But companionship of young boys happened to them in the guise of discipleship (Irada) and intent of asceticism (2). Ibn al-Jawzi decides that the bane of Sufis in his time was in accompanying young boys and associating with opposites (3). The calamity did not stop at this limit but went beyond it to legitimize that for the Sufis. Abu al-Fadl, Muhammad bin Tahir, known as Ibn al-Qaysarani al-Shaybani d. 507 AH = 1113 AD wrote a treatise on the permissibility of Sama' and looking at beardless youths (4).\nAmong the Sufis famous for shamelessness and permissiveness were Khidr al-Kurdi, the Sheikh of King al-Zahir Baybars, Sheikh Abu al-Hasan al-Hariri, and Sulayman bin al-Muwallah the Majdhub (ecstatic). Ali al-Hariri was the most shameless of Sufis in associating with young boys, \"so whoever",

The Mamluk Emirs competed in acquiring their boys and girls. Those remaining of these Oirats after that joined the army, and dispersed in the kingdoms spreading corruption with them. Groups of Sufis found what they were looking for in them, so they exaggerated in conferring Sufi legitimacy on their heinous act. Al-Sha'rani - one of the major Sufis of the tenth century AH - reported to us the news of the righteous Muhammad bin Iraqi, who would not enable his son Ali to go out to the market, when he was beardless, unless he was veiled for fear for him from evil and temptation (Fitna) (3).\nThe matter did not stop at beardless youths and young boys but extended to others like beasts and animals. The Sufi Sheikh Ali Wahish (d. 917 AH / 1511 AD) was a frequent assaulter of beasts and female donkeys (4).\nThis type of Sufism was a mockery of religions, a distance from the path of asceticism and worship, and shamelessness, until the Sufis of the centuries following the sixth",

We do not have a reliable text regarding how it entered the Islamic world, as narrations about it have varied. Some narrations attribute it to the Indian Birzatan who carried it with him from India to Persia in the first century AH, and then it was transferred by the Qalandariyyah group who were organized in the ranks of Sufism, and they shaved their heads, eyebrows, and mustaches (2).\nAnother narration attributes its discovery to Sheikh Haydar d. 618 AH = 1221 AD, who made it a Waqf (endowment) for his comrades from the Sufis of Khorasan, and bequeathed that it be planted on his grave after his death. From there it moved to Baghdad, then the Levant and Egypt. It is worth noting that the Haydariyyah group came to Damascus after the year 655 AH = 1257 AD, wearing conical hats (Taratir) on their heads, their beards cut, and their mustaches uncut. They built a Zawiya for themselves outside Damascus, and from there they reached Egypt (3).\nSufi poets sang the praises of hashish, and called it by several names such as the Hashish of the Fuqara, Haydar's Wine, and Qalandariyyah. Their poet Muhammad bin Ali bin al-A'ma was the poet most fond of mentioning the virtues of hashish, so he said: [Tawil Meter]",

Through exercise, according to their belief, the Sufi completely detaches from human fortunes. This belief is fundamentally the belief of the Brahmins (2), but it spread among the Sufis, and they were keen to publish news telling of one of them flying in the air.

The effects of that extended to the following eras, especially in the Ottoman era, when Sufi orders became widely spread with many followers.\nSufism in that era was an evil that afflicted society, corrupting values and morals, and destroying laws and Sunan.

Because a large number of the town's interests, such as shops, bathhouses, markets, orchards, agricultural villages, mills, presses, and others, were endowed to the Sufis of a Khanqah or recommended to spend their revenue on a specific Sufi group. Consequently, only a handful of society benefits from these interests, enjoying their goods and gifts. They even influenced the course of political and social events in the nation, becoming influential and close to the rulers. In fact, the rulers themselves began to fear them, so they fawned over them by exaggerating in honoring them and lavishing money on them.\nThese Sufis constituted a heavy burden on the economy of society. The locals and farmers were burdened by providing for their needs, hoping to please them and gain their prayers. Goals were reversed, and Sufis drowned in corruption and corruption-spreading, directing social life as they wished. Their aura grew, and their influence exacerbated. So a group of scholars undertook the task of alerting society to the state of deterioration the Sufi movement had reached, by awakening feelings for the principles of true Sufism. This group of scholars re-examined Sufism and the reality of the Sufi in terms of principles and goals. The intent of that was to raise the issue among people, so they could compare the condition of Sufis in their time with what they ought to be.\nThe author of our treatise, Ja'far bin Tha'lab al-Adfawi, was one of those scholars who",

Thus, Waqf is not valid for Sufis due to the lack of discipline in the meaning of Sufism and its stopping at a limit.\nThe author of the treatise elaborated in citing what is in the four schools of thought regarding the permissibility or impermissibility of Waqf.

It is answered that it is predominant on those who seek roughness of living, minimizing the world, and austerity in it. Who leaves soft clothes and is content with rough ones. Wearing wool and cotton is predominant in this state. Wool is more predominant due to the generality of its existence, and its roughness is more than the roughness of cotton.
