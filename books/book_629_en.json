    "text": "Al-Muzaffar bin al-Fadl Al-Alawi. Praise be to Allah, Whose signs are dazzling, Whose assaults are overpowering, Whose benevolence is ancient, Whose authority is magnificent, Whose gifts are ample, Whose drinking places are delightful, Whose generosity is vast, Whose threat is crushing, Whose gift is abundant, Whose trial is beautiful, Whose reward is great, Whose punishment is severe, Whose Book is mighty, Whose reckoning is brief. The sights do not encompass Him, nor does the beholder perceive Him, nor do barriers veil Him, nor is He described as incapable. He sent Muhammad as His Prophet, His chosen one, and His pure friend, proclaiming the truth, truthful in speech, clarifying the newness of the paths, and advising all creation. So he stood up while the banners of guidance were obliterated, the landmarks of piety were effaced, ignorance was roaming, and misguidance was comprehensive. So he proclaimed what he was commanded, repelled what was denied, guided to rationality, and demolished what disbelief had founded and built. May Allah bless him and his family, the lamps of darkness, the keys to blessings, the downpours of wisdom, and the garments of generosity, and his chosen companions, and his elected parties, a perpetual prayer until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows: I was one day in the assembly of our master, the chief of the chiefs of mankind, the king of the ministers of the East and the West, whose commands are effective far and near, Mu'ayyad al-Din, acceptable to the Commander of the Faithful, Abu Talib Muhammad bin Ahmad—may Allah support his state and support his word. The foreheads of virtues have prostrated to his manners, and the lips of the piercing stars have kissed the soles of his high aspirations. Aspirations soaring over the head of Suha (a star)... seeking the center of element and origin. And for everything there is an element that shelters to... the ends of its center without aversion. His literature relieves poverty from the captivity of thoughts, and his talents extract pearls from the navels of the seas. The markets of virtues are established with him on their stalk, and the she-camels of favors are driven from before him with their loads. The extreme reach of his mind is not attained by the limits of ability, and if another is compared to him, it is said: 'Amr has outgrown the collar.' His house is fragrant with the scent of Darin (musk), and his place is worthy of the descent of blessing. A house in which flow torrents of virtues... and favors for a questioning one or a asker. So the excuse is withheld in it from a hoper... and knowledge is spread in it for the ignorant. The discussion of poetry and its attributes took place, entering its doors and striking its smooth stones (testing it), what is permissible in it and what is prohibited, mentioning the virtue for which it was praised and the vice for which it was blamed, researching its benefits and harms, its purity and impurities, and whether engaging in it is better, or abandoning it is more abundant and weightier. Each of those present brought the strangest of what he heard, the most wondrous of what he innovated, the most novel of what he understood, and the most subtle of what he knew. So despite the excuse-making in it, he was a brother to deficiency, and after prolixity, a companion of weakness and shortcoming. So our master commanded—and his command is obeyed, and his opposition is not possible—that I establish for him papers on that, and seek rain from the clouds of the minds of the predecessors in showers, and not need in it to seek guidance from others, nor to seek illumination from anyone else. So I hastened to follow his desire, and seek his intended pasture, 'And if he wished, his fire-stick when he struck it would have ignited, and all game is in the belly of the wild ass (meaning he encompasses all).' I have answered that in five chapters, devoid of prattle and excess, inclining to brevity, and speaking with conciseness. For comprehensive coverage of what has been narrated in it, and written on its meanings, requires the authorship of several books, and emptiness for it in a long period, and time for that is tight, and attachments hinder and obstruct it. 'And I swear if something other than you came to us... its messenger, but we found no defense against you.' We have named this book 'Nadra al-Ighrid fi Nusrat al-Qarid' (The Freshness of the Spadix in Support of Poetry), as we based it on the defense of poetry and poets, and we sharpened it for the struggle of the debater and peers. We hope from Allah Almighty that we present in its chapters, and sharpen from its blades, what will be quenching for thirst, beneficial for illness, satisfying for the one lacking in literature, and convincing for the one looking into its meanings. Even if it is a peak that has been ascended, and a virginity that has been deflowered, we, with the help of the Ancient—Exalted is His Majesty—strive not to fall short in that betting, nor to be belittled regarding the positions of those knights. And from Him, Glory be to Him and Exalted, we seek success and the straightening of the path, and He is our Sufficiency and the best Disposer of affairs. Chapter One: On the description of poetry and its rulings, and the explanation of its conditions and divisions.",

    "text": "Chapter Two: On what the poet is permitted to use and what is not permitted, and by which the correctness of speech is recognized and allowed. Chapter Three: On the merit of poetry and its benefits, and its impact on hearts and its occurrences. Chapter Four: On revealing what it was praised for, and blamed because of, and whether engaging in it is more reforming, or rejecting it is more abundant and weightier. Chapter Five: On what the poet must aim for, avoid, discard, and seek. \n\n**Chapter One**\n**On the Description of Poetry and Its Rulings**\n**And Explanation of Its Conditions and Divisions**\n\nThe first thing I begin with in this chapter is to say that the derivation of the word 'Shi'r' (poetry) is from knowledge, perception, and acumen. You say: 'Layta shi'ri' (Would that I knew) whether the rain of the sky hit the dwellings of Asma', meaning: Would that my knowledge. The poet said - recited by Ibn al-A'rabi:\n'Would that I knew (shi'ri), while wishes do not benefit... Will I leave early one day while my affair is resolved?\nAnd under my saddle is a Zafayan Mayla'... A lean camel, if urged, she strides wide.\nAs if she is a wailing woman grieving... weeping for a dead one while another is the pained one.'\nZafayan: A she-camel that struts in her walk, and Mayla': fast and escaping. The poet was called a 'Sha'ir' (poet) for his knowledge and acumen. As for them calling poetry 'Qarid', it is because its derivation is from 'Qard' which is cutting, because it is cut from speech a cutting, meaning it is severed from it a severing, just as a thing is cut with scissors (Miqrad). Allah Almighty said: \"And when it set, it cut them (taqriduhum) to the left,\" meaning it passed them and left them on one of the two sides. Abdul Aziz bin Hatim bin Al-Nu'man Ibn Al-Ahmar said, and he used to satirize Al-Farazdaq:\n'I exile the speck of poetry from it when I cut it (aqriduhu)... So there is no defect nor fault in my poetry.\nAs if I select my poetry and scoop it... From the wave of a deep, swelling, overflowing sea.\nFrom it are strange proverbs, famous... gathered; indeed, it is my arrangement and my mastery.'\nAs for 'Qasid', which is the plural of 'Qasida' like 'Safin' is the plural of 'Safina', its word is derived from 'Qisda', which is a piece of something when it breaks, as if it is a piece of speech. From that is 'Rumh Qisad' (a broken spear) and 'taqassada' when it becomes pieces. Al-Musayyab bin 'Alas said:\n'I will surely send with the winds a poem (Qasida)... from me, carried deep to Al-Qa'qa'.\nIt arrives at the waters, so it never ceases to be strange... among the people, between proverbs and hearing.'\nAs for their naming the poem 'Qafiyah', it is because the rhyme (Qafiyah) follows (taqfu) the verse, meaning it trails it. They named the whole by a single name for brevity and abbreviation, just as they named the poem in its entirety a 'Kalimah' (word), and the 'Kalimah' is a single utterance, inclining towards abbreviating speech and relying on what indicates completeness in it. Al-Khansa' said:\n'And a rhyme (Qafiyah) like the edge of the spearhead... remains while the one who said it perishes.\nYou spoke it, O Ibn Amr, so you made it easy... and people did not speak the likes of it.'\nI say: Poetry is an expression of organized words indicating understood meanings. And if you wish, you can say: Poetry is an expression of arranged words indicating intended meanings. If prose is compared to it, [poetry] is more brilliant in beginnings, purer in endings, faster in rein, more eloquent in tongue, more wandering as a proverb, sharper as a blade, straighter as arrows, more intense in dispute, brighter as a star, more blooming as a flower, more lasting in marks, purer in smiles, more intelligent in pathways, purer in landmarks, more elegant in hearing, and more sticking to natures. Al-Asma'i said: Poetry is what its wording is little, its meaning is easy, fine, and subtle; that which if you hear it, you think you can attain it, but if you attempt it, you find it far. Whatever is other than that is organized speech. Some eloquent people said: Poetry is an expression of a current proverb, a rare simile, and a metaphor with luxurious wording. Al-Ghaznawi narrated to me from Hibatullah known as Ibn al-Shajari, who said: Abu Zakariya al-Tabrizi told me, saying: I used to ask Al-Ma'arri about poetry I read to him, and he would say to me: 'This is good organization (Nazm).' But if a good verse passed by him, he would say: 'O Abu Zakariya, this is Poetry.' As for poetry, it requires tools, and in it are titles and it has attributes. We will mention that generally, and explain it in detail, without intending order in it, since presenting one chapter over another does not require refinement. Regarding poetry:",

And Allah is the Grantor of success to the clear path of guidance by His will and generosity. \n\n1 - As for Grammar, it is one of the conditions of the speaker, whether he is a versifier or a prose writer, an orator or a poet. It is impossible to dispense with it except for the mute who cannot articulate a single letter. Some eloquent people used to say: 'I find for solecism (Lahn) in my mouth a stench like the stench of meat.' The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"May Allah have mercy on a man who corrected his tongue.\" This is an encouragement to rectify the tongue and discipline the human being. Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 'Learn grammar, for the Children of Israel disbelieved because of a single letter written in the Noble Gospel, which was: \"Ana walladtu 'Isa\" (I gave birth to Jesus - with shaddah on Lam), so they lightened it (to \"waladtu\" - I begot) and disbelieved.' What has been narrated urging the learning of grammar and regarding the honor of its virtue and the majesty of its craft, if we undertook to recount it, we would need a separate book for it. For by knowing it, the Book of Allah (Mighty and Majestic) is understood, and what it contained of His wisdom, and what He deposited in it of His clear verses, His illuminating proofs, His clear Quran, and His healing admonitions. And by it, the traditions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) leading to his commands, prohibitions, laws, and sunan are understood. By it, a person expands in his logic; if he speaks, he is eloquent; if he argues, he clarifies; if he writes, he is expressive; and if he gives a sermon, he impresses.",

    "text": "The meaning of 'Nahw' (Grammar) is pursuing the direction (samt) of the speech of the Arabs in its inflection, including declension (I'rab), dualization, pluralization, breaking (irregular plurals), diminutives, attribution (Nisba), and other things. It is originally a common verbal noun (masdar) from your saying: 'Nahawtu nahwan', meaning I intended an intention. Then the pursuit of this type of knowledge was specifically designated by it, so it became as if restricted to it and not others, just as 'Fiqh' (Jurisprudence) is originally the verbal noun of 'Faqihtu al-shay'', meaning I understood it. Then the science of Sharia regarding the lawful and unlawful was specifically designated by it. And just as 'Bayt Allah' (House of Allah) was specifically designated for the Kaaba, even though all houses belong to Allah Almighty. Parallels of what was common then restricted in its genus to one of its types are many. It was narrated about a Bedouin that he said: 'Indeed you look in many \"Nuhuww\" (directions),' likening it to ' 'Utuww' (arrogance/excess), which is rare in their speech. The rule for such a Waw, if it comes in a plural, is [to become] Ya', like their saying in the plural of 'Haqw': 'Huqiyy'. The first to speak of Grammar was Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, and the story regarding that is well-known. When the method became clear by his example, and the straight and crooked became distinct by his speech, the paths in it branched out, and the causes in its meanings expanded. The origin is three words: Noun (Ism), Predicate/Verb (Khabar), and Particle (Adat) indicating a meaning. The Noun is every described thing of creation. Creation is three things: either a body, a color, or an action. As for the Predicate, it is everything that establishes an unknown or sets up a description from a noun or other. However, the word we allocated to it is the word whose utterance only occurs as a predicate, and it is every word indicating the occurrence of a temporary movement, like your saying: 'Fa'ala' (he did) and 'Yaf'alu' (he does), or 'Fu'ila' (it was done) or 'Yuf'alu' (it is being done). As for what occurs sometimes as a predicate and sometimes as a subject (Mukhbar 'anhu), we disliked naming it a predicate since its state does not endure. As for the Particle, it is everything other than being a noun or a predicate. It is a word that does not occur as a description nor described. The word we named Predicate is, in the terminology of grammarians, Verb (Fi'l), and that is a mistake. Because your saying 'Fa'ala' or 'Yaf'alu' or 'Fu'ila' or 'Yuf'alu' is merely informing about the occurrence of the action and its happening, and informing about the occurrence of the thing is different from the thing itself. If 'Fa'ala' or 'Yaf'alu' were an Action (Fi'l), you could describe it, praising it or blaming it, like saying: 'Ni'ma al-Fi'l' (Excellent is the action) he believed and reformed, and 'Bi'sa al-Fi'l' (Miserable is the action) he disbelieved and corrupted. This is the summary of the explanation of the three words by which Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, encompassed utterances and gathered meanings. For every type of these three types, there are different forms, divergent branches, and distinct meanings that grammarians have finished with in their books. What he presented has objections that Abu Ali answered in 'Ilal al-Mantiq' (Causes of Logic), and I narrated his speech and reported from him. As for poetry, its skin is not safe from tanning defects (nafal), nor its sick part cured from illnesses, except by knowing Grammar, extending one's reach in it, and understanding its obscure and hidden parts, as the modern poet said: 'And if you want the most majestic of sciences... then the most majestic of them is the rectifer of tongues.' In this brief overview is sufficiency.",

    "text": "2 - As for Rhetoric (Balagha), it is Eloquence (Fasaha). It is said: 'Balugha al-rajul' (The man became eloquent) with a Damma on the Lam, so he is 'Baligh'. There is no difference between Balagha and Bayan (Clarity/Expression) except in the wording. Someone was asked about Balagha, and he said: 'Brief speech whose meaning reaches your heart closer than its wording reaches your ear.' Ja'far bin Muhammad al-Sadiq, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'The eloquent one (Baligh) is named Baligh only because he reaches (yablughu) his need with the easiest of his striving.' Ibn al-A'rabi said: Al-Mufaddal al-Dabbi said: I asked a Bedouin about Balagha, and he said: 'Brevity without incapacity, and prolixity without nonsense.' Al-Attabi was asked: 'What is Balagha?' He said: 'He who makes you understand his need without impediment, nor stuttering, nor seeking help.' Some wise men were asked about Balagha, and they said: 'Whoever takes many meanings and conveys them with few words, and takes few meanings and generates from them many words, he is eloquent.' It was said: 'Balagha is speech that is good upon hearing it, concise upon its improvisation.' It was said: 'Balagha is a glance indicating what is in the conscience.' It was said: 'The eloquent one is he who reaches what he wants, whether he lengthens or shortens.' Some said: 'Eloquence is correcting the divisions and choosing the speech.' It was said: 'Balagha is knowing separation from connection.' I say: The combination of B-L-Gh (Ba-Lam-Ghayn) means attaining what a human attempts with strength and mastery of ability. From that is: 'Balaghta al-amr wal-gharad' (You reached the matter and the goal) if you stood at its limit and overlooked its end; were it not for your strength over it, you would not have reached it. From that is Balagha, for if you stand at the limits of speech and ends of meanings, that indicates your ability in literature and your mastery of the language of the Arabs. Whether you are brief or verbose, you are eloquent in it, and what you brought is eloquence. From that is Gh-L-B (Ghayn-Lam-Ba); 'Ghalab' (victory/overcoming) only comes from strength, mastery, and ability. From that is L-Gh-B (Lam-Ghayn-Ba); 'Lughub' is fatigue, and that only comes from diligence and intensity of movement indicating strength and ability for movements and mastery of violent striving at all times. From that is B-Gh-L (Ba-Ghayn-Lam); it is said 'Baghghala al-faras' (The horse paced) if it walked between the trot ('Anaq) and the pace (Hamlaja). From it is 'Tabghil', which is a fast walk with variation, and that only comes from strength and ability to strive. Among the highest degrees of Balagha and the loftiest in prose speech is His Almighty's saying: \"And it was said, 'O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold your rain.' And the water subsided, and the matter was accomplished, and the ship came to rest on the Judi. And it was said, 'Away with the wrongdoing people.'\" And His Almighty's saying: \"So proclaim what you are commanded.\" Among Balagha in poetic speech is the saying of Imru' al-Qais:\n'Stop, let us weep from the memory of a beloved and a dwelling...'\nFor he stopped and asked to stop, wept and asked to weep, and expressed love by remembering the beloved and the dwelling in half a verse. Tarafa said:\n'I am not one to dwell in the hilltops out of fear... but when the people ask for support, I support.'\nThe meaning is more than the wording. He says: I do not dwell in hidden places fearing hospitality (having to feed guests), but I dwell in visible places that are not hidden from the knocking guest. So if I am asked for hospitality, I give it. He presented speech indicating the negation of his dwelling in hilltops only out of fear. When he mentioned support (rifd) in the second half, it indicated that the fear was of hospitality. He did not counter the wording by saying: 'But I dwell in the highland, visible, and I am brave.' He sufficed with the listener's knowledge and what the speech indicated. This is pure eloquence. \n\n3 - As for Eloquence (Fasaha), speaking about it requires a long explanation that would take us away from our purpose, and restricting it is neither healing nor sufficient. We have exhausted the divisions of that in the 'Alawiyya Epistle', and we followed in it the path of Abdullah bin Sinan al-Khafaji in the beginning of his book titled 'Sirr al-Fasaha' (The Secret of Eloquence). Fasaha is derived from disclosure (Kashf) and the lifting of ambiguity. It is said: 'Afsaha al-laban ifsahan' (The milk became clear) when the colostrum goes away from it and the milk becomes pure. And the she-camel 'Afsahat', so she is 'Mufsih', when her colostrum ceases and her milk becomes pure. And the milk 'Fasuha' when you uncover its foam from it. The poet said:\n'............ ... And under the foam is the clear (Fasih) milk.'\nAnd 'Afsaha al-subh' (The morning became clear) when it was revealed and appeared. Everything clear is 'Mufsih'. Based on that, every speaker is eloquent (Fasih), and what does not speak is mute (A'jam). This brief overview in this place is sufficient.",

    "text": "4 - As for the Literal (Haqiqa) and Metaphorical (Majaz), the Literal is what is established upon its original placement in the language when used. The Metaphorical is what is contrary to that. Ali bin Isa al-Rummani said: The Literal is the indication of meaning without the aspect of metaphor (Isti'ara), and the Metaphorical is exceeding the original to metaphor. One only deviates from the Literal to the Metaphorical for three meanings, which are: Expansion (Ittisa'), Emphasis (Tawkid), and Simile (Tashbih). If these qualities are absent, the Literal is more worthy of use. Allah Almighty said: \"And We admitted him into Our mercy.\" This is a Majaz, and it contains the three qualities. As for Expansion, He increased the names of directions, and the place is a noun, which is Mercy. As for Simile, He likened Mercy, even if entry into it is not physically valid, to what can be entered, and thus placed it in its stead. As for Emphasis, He reported about an accident (attribute) with what is reported about a substance. This is elevating the accident and aggrandizing it, as it was put in the domain of what is seen, touched, and witnessed. Majaz in the poetry of Arabs is numerous and uncountable. From it is the saying of the first:\n'Abundant of robe (generous), when he smiles laughing... the necks of wealth break at his laughter.'\nTarafa said:\n'And a face as if the sun cast its robe... upon it, pure of color, not wrinkled.'\nHe assigned a robe to the sun, which is a substance, because it is more eloquent than light, which is an accident. All that is of these metaphors falls under Majaz. Glory be to His Majesty, He said: \"So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold (Al-'Urwa Al-Wuthqa) with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.\" He began the verse with literal speech, then made the answer metaphorical and a metaphor because its occurrence is more emphatic than the literal. The intent is to liken the one holding fast to the conditions of faith to one holding fast to a firm handhold of a rope's loops because he protects himself by it from slippery slides and destructive falls. Then He Almighty said: \"no break in it,\" distancing it from the likeness of familiar loops which might break with prolonged pulling or whose strength wears out over time. \n\n5 - As for Craft (San'a) and Crafted (Masnu'), Craft is an expression for accidents in crafted things, such as repair and corruption, length and shortness, hugeness and thinness, greenness and redness, motion and stillness, and things theologians call accidents. As for Crafted things, they are the things upon which these accidents succeed. So Craft and Crafted things are originated (muhdath). Among crafted things is the animal that Allah Almighty creates, and images in inanimate objects that we make. The indications in images from the skill of painters in their actions upon them make you imagine that some of them are speaking even though they do not speak, and some make you imagine they are moving while they are still. You call the body 'crafted' in the literal language, and you call it 'craft' by expansion and Majaz. Do you not see that you say: 'This is a crafted body of good craft', or 'ugly craft', and 'perfect craft' or 'imperfect craft', even if the origin of the two words in them is one. I only presented this as a prelude so you know that Craft in poetry is an expression for the organization (Nazm) that purifies it from prose, and gathers its scattered parts after dispersion and cracking. And that the Crafted is the poetry whose element is prose speech. The Crafted is not called crafted until it exits from non-existence to existence. When it exists, it is called crafted because it is witnessed and known. Then criticism takes turns on it after that, so it is said of it: complete and deficient, beautiful and ugly, sick and sound, and good and bad. I saw people among the authors mixing Craft with Criticism and Criticism with Craft, and not distinguishing between the Crafted and the Craft, and this is a mistake and excess. Do you not see that it is not permissible to say regarding poetry you haven't heard or connected with: 'good and bad', until you stand upon it and repeat looking at it? You have known by this subtle indication and light expression what the difference is between the Crafted and the Craft, and between the Craft and the Criticism, and Allah is the Grantor of success. \n\n6 - As for Establishing Meter, it is an expression of a natural taste that preserved its measures (fusul) from addition and decrease, and adjusted them with the adjustment of justice by the scale. If every versifier of poetry needed, in establishing his meter, correcting its breakage, and adjusting its measures, to know Prosody ('Arud) and Rhymes (Qawafi), only a few people would have composed poetry. However, if the poet knows them, he cannot dispense with them.",

    "text": "As for Prosody ('Arud), which is feminine, it is the scale of poetry by which its sound is extracted from its broken. All poetry is composed of a Sabab (cord), a Watad (peg), and a Fasilah (separator). The Sabab is two Sababs, the Watad two Watads, and the Fasilah two Fasilahs. The scansion (Taqti') of poetry is based on pronunciation, not writing. Every stressed letter counts as two letters: the first silent, and the second moving (vowelled). The difference between the silent and the moving is that the three vowels succeed upon the silent, while the moving is specialized with one of them. The paradigms by which poetry is scanned are eight: two are five-lettered, which are Fa'ulun, Fa'ilun; and six are seven-lettered, which are: Mafa'ilun, Mustaf'ilun, Fa'ilatun, Mufa'alatun, Mutafa'ilun, Maf'ulatu. Whatever comes after that is a Zihaf (deviation) of it, or a branch upon it. Zihaf is permissible like the original, and Kasr (breakage) is prohibited. Zihaf only occurs in Asbab (cords), and Kharm and Qat' (cutting) only occur in Awtad (pegs). The 'Arud is the name for the last foot in the first half of the verse, and the Darb is the name for the last foot in the second half of the verse. Every rhymed (Musarra') verse, its 'Arud follows the weight of its Darb or what is permissible in its Darb. Tasri' (internal rhyme) is likened to the two leaves of a door. If the verse is devoid of Tasri', it is called Musmat. Poetry in total has thirty-four 'Aruds, sixty-three Darbs, and fifteen meters (seas). The explanation of that has been completed by prosodists in their books, so know it. \n\n7 - As for Rhymes (Qawafi), the Qafiyah is disputed. According to Abu al-Hasan al-Akhfash and those who followed him among rhyme scholars: The Qafiyah is the last word in the verse. He said: It was named Qafiyah because it follows (taqfu) the verse. According to Al-Nadr bin Shumayl, Mu'arrij, and Abu Amr al-Jarmi, it is the last half of the verse. It was said it is the verse in its entirety, and it was said the poem in its entirety. According to Al-Khalil bin Ahmad: The Qafiyah is from the end of the verse to the first silent letter preceding it along with the moving letter before the silent one. Upon his saying is the reliance, for the saying is what Hadhram said. The Qafiyah is divided into three things: Roots (Usul), Letters (Huruf), and Movements (Harakat). The Roots are: Mutakawis, Mutarakib, Mutadarik, Mutawatir, Mutaradif. The Letters are: Dakhil, Ta'sis, Ridf, Khuruj, Wasl, and Rawi. The Movements are: Tawjih, Ishba', Rass, Hadhw, Nafadh, and Majra. Four defects occur in the Qafiyah, which are: Ikfa', Iqwa', Ita', and Sinad. And Tadmin, which is that the verse is not complete except with the one following it, and it is among the disliked defects of poetry. This has been organized in poetry. The poet said:\n'The Rhymes are five-fold threes... Movements, letters, and corruption.\nSo their beginning is Rass, Hadhw, and Ishba'... and Majra, and in Nafadh is the equipment.\nAnd the letters: Al-Rawi, Al-Ridf, and Al-Ta'... sis (Ta'sis), Al-Wasl, and Al-Khuruj is the pillar.\nAnd the defects: Al-Ita', Al-Iqwa', and Al-Ik... fa (Ikfa'), and in them Tadmin then Al-Sinad.'\nAnother said:\n'The letters of Rhymes are six, evident... a system gathers scattered ones for them.\nRawi, Wasl, Khuruj, and its Ridf... and its Ta'sis, then Al-Dakhil is completion.\nAnd following this, its movements are necessary... likewise six, an Imam fashioned them.\nSo Majra, Tawjih, Hadhw, and its Rass... and its Ishba', then Al-Nafadh is a support.'\nAll letters of the alphabet can be a Rawi except Waw, Ya', and Alif, the silent additions that follow what is before them, for they are never a Rawi at all. The Alif of duality, the Waw of plural, and the Ya' of the feminine pronoun are not Rawi. The Alif substituted for Tanwin like your saying 'Ra'aytu Zayda' is not Rawi, nor the light Nun like your saying 'Idriban', nor the Hamza substituted for the feminine Alif in pause like your saying 'Hadhihi Hubla' (This is a pregnant woman), nor the Ha' of pause, the Ha' of pronoun, and the feminine Ha'; all these are not Rawi. If what is before these Ha's is silent, they can be Rawi. The original Ha' may be a Rawi, whether what is before it is silent or moving, like the saying of Ru'bah bin al-'Ajjaj:\n'Ubayla killed me and I did not notice... Life is nothing but the heedlessness of the love-struck.\nWhen she saw me, worn of camouflage... Shining of the bald forehead stones.\nAfter the raven-black youth, the foolish.'",

    "text": "The Rawi letter was named Rawi because it is from 'Riwa'', which is the rope used to tie loads and luggage to gather them. 'Rawa' in their speech is for joining, gathering, and connecting. Likewise, the Rawi letter; all letters of the verse join and gather to it. Thus, rhymes are seals on the address of poetry, gathering the ends of its meanings, grasping the reins of its foals. \n\n8 - As for Titles (Alqab), they are divided into sections, and for each section of them is a chapter. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Allusion (Ishara)**\nAllusion is one of the beauties of Badi' (rhetoric). Its meaning is the inclusion of few words over many meanings, even if by the slightest glance one infers what was concealed of long explanation, like the saying of Imru' al-Qais:\n'On a huge horse that gives you before asking him... varieties (afanin) of running, neither stiff nor weak.'\nContemplate what is under the word 'afanin', and what is associated with it of all types of quality, then he negated stiffness and weakness from him, which are the two biggest defects of horses.\nZuhair said:\n'If I met you and we faced each other... there would be a guarantor for every denied thing.'\nThis is few words indicating much meaning. As some Bedouins said:\n'I made my hands a sash for him... and some knights do not embrace.'\nHis saying: 'I made my hands a sash for him' is a marvelous allusion to embracing without its word, and it indicates it.\nAl-A'sha said:\n'You hear a whisper from the jewelry when she leaves... as a rustling 'ishriq plant sought help from a wind.'\nHe alluded by that to the slenderness of the waist, agility, and lankness, because the movement of the sashes indicates that. As for anklets, bracelets, and rings, they are described with silence and muteness. In the verse is another allusion to the intensity of motion, which is his saying: 'as a rustling 'ishriq plant sought help from a wind', for the 'ishriq is a tree intense in motion in a weak breeze, so how about if it sought help from a wind?\nAl-Khansa' said:\n'The rising of the sun reminds me of Sakhr... and I remember him at every setting of the sun.'\nA good allusion to the time of raiding, the time of Maysir (gambling game), and feeding the guest.\nAl-Quhayf said:\n'The call of Ka'b came to me at Al-Aqiq... so the Nab' (tree) and the thirsty spears yearned.'\nA good allusion to aiding him with the army.\nAnother said:\n'And Zayd is dead with the grief of the bustard... because Sukayna and Al-Rabab departed.'\nA good allusion to the intensity of worry. That is because birds gather in places far from humans and shed their feathers there, including the bustard. Then they graze until their feathers grow. When the feathers of all those birds grow, the bustard lags behind them because its feathers are slow to appear. So all the birds rise and the bustard remains, so most of them die of grief.\nIbn al-A'rabi recited:\n'We walked and leveled the graves at 'Aqil... so its graves became beautiful after ugliness.'\nMeaning we killed for our killed ones, so the number of our killed and theirs became equal. This is a wondrous, subtle allusion to taking revenge. In this chapter is breadth, and our effort is to be brief.\nClose to the meaning of Allusion, though the expression differs, is:\n\n**Chapter of Metonymy (Kinaya)**\nSome people may call it Tatbi' (Following) because the poet says a meaning and brings a word following it; if the follower indicates, it reveals the followed. From that is His Almighty's saying: \"And hearts reached the throats,\" a metonymy for the intensity of the matter and war. The meaning of that is that hearts rose from their places and shied away as if they wanted to exit the bodies, separating from them.\nAnd His Almighty's saying: \"And We did not make them a body not eating food.\" Within this speech is a metonymy for drinking, not mentioned due to the indication of eating to it, and a metonymy for defecation and urination, because whoever eats needs to drink, and whoever eats and drinks needs to defecate and urinate.\nAl-Mubarrad recited:\n'She says, while weeping has shown scars... in his eye: Will you not treat your eye with kohl?\nFor I have seen kohl occupy an amount... of the eye, an amount that was not occupied away from you.'\nA metonymy that he does not like to occupy his eye from looking at her, because the time that goes into occupying with kohl was not, before kohl, occupied with other than looking at her, so he dislikes not being in the state he was in.\nBal'a' bin Qais al-Kinani said:\n'With me is every loose-robed one, as if he... when he walks, is limping on the sole of the foot.'\nA metonymy for luxury and grace.\nAl-Minhal said:",

    "text": "'If there is heat, they advance me to its heat... and if there is cold, they delay me from the cold.'\nHe used heat as a metonymy for evil, and cold for good.\nThey recited:\n'With salt, what is feared to change is preserved... so what is the medicine for salt if changes befall it?'\nA metonymy for the matter for whose revealing the Sultan is hoped, so that Sultan is afflicted with a matter that distracts him from performing what is hoped of him.\nAl-Nabigha al-Dhubyani said:\n'Six fathers, they are what they are... they are better than whoever drinks the water of clouds.'\nA metonymy that they are the best of all people, because all people drink the water of clouds.\nMu'aqqir al-Bariqi said:\n'And every thrower in the running places, as if she... when she washes with water, is a breaking eagle.'\nHe describes a mare, likening her, when she sweats from galloping and fatigue, to a breaking eagle, which is the Fat-ha'; Fatakh is a praiseworthy softness in the wing. This is a metonymy using water for sweat. He meant that in this state where her likes become weak, this is her condition, so how would she be at the start of her run!\nThe predecessor to this meaning is Imru' al-Qais where he says:\n'As if she, when the water overflowed and she gathered herself... is a white-headed eagle to whom a wolf appeared at the lookout.'\nIn this verse are additions that Mu'aqqir's verse did not reach, which is his saying 'the water overflowed'. Overflowing is greater than what is washed with, because washing happens from the overflowing and more. And his saying 'gathered herself' is an exaggeration in effort and fatigue. And his saying 'a white-headed eagle to whom a wolf appeared at the lookout': the Saq'a' is the eagle with whiteness in its face. If a wolf appears to it, it is more intense for its swooping. And if its swooping is from a lookout, it is more intense for its descent.\nUmar bin Abi Rabi'ah said:\n'Far is the falling place of the earring; either to Nawfal... belongs her father, or to Abd Shams and Hashim.'\nHe used that as a metonymy for the length of necks. Similar is the saying of Humayd al-Arqat:\n'Long is the falling place of the twins of earrings.'\nAmr bin Qi'as al-Ghutayfi said:\n'And a black-eyed one, intimate of a rock... watching me with anticipation, I have shot.'\nHe used that as a metonymy for a doe.\n'And meat that people did not taste before me... I ate in emptiness and selected.'\nAl-Asma'i, Abu Amr al-Shaybani, and Ibn al-A'rabi said he used that as a metonymy for the flesh of his son, for he hungered so he slaughtered him and ate him. Others said he used it as a metonymy for a king whom he satirized and no one had satirized before him, so it was as if he ate his flesh dead.\n'And water not from a quenching spring... nor water of the sky have I drawn.'\nA metonymy for his tears.\n'And a girl disputing my robe with me... behind the tribe, I have no house upon me.'\nA metonymy for the wind.\n'And a fire kindled without a fire-stick... I stirred its hell then warmed myself.'\nA metonymy for war.\n'And a house not of fur and hair... on the back of the mount I have built.'\nHe used it as a metonymy for a verse of poetry he composed on the back of his camel.\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'And a carrier of ninety, she did not meet of them... in a place except a trustworthy brother, empty.'\nHe used that as a metonymy for the quiver and the arrows in it, meaning he did not find for it a child except a trustworthy brother, describing her arrows with quality, accuracy, and penetration.\nThe story of Khawwat bin Jubayr al-Ansari with the woman of the two butter-skins (Dhat al-Nihyayn) is famous. He came to her to buy ghee (clarified butter) and found her alone, so he desired her. She untied a skin, he tasted it and pushed it to her. She untied another, he tasted it and was not pleased. He said: 'Hold it, for my camel has strayed.' She said: 'Wait until I tie the head of this skin.' He said: 'Either you hold it, or I throw it from my hand.' So she held it. When he occupied her hands, he assaulted her and she could not repel him, so he fulfilled his desire from her. That was in the Jahiliyyah. When Islam came, Khawwat embraced Islam and witnessed Badr. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to him one day, smiling: 'O Khawwat, what did your straying camel do?' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, Islam has shackled it.' It was narrated that he said to him: 'O Khawwat, how is your straying?' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, Allah has provided better than it, and I seek refuge in Allah from deficiency after increase (al-hawr ba'd al-kawr).' The Prophet (peace be upon him) used the best and most subtle metonymy for his past deed. And Khawwat's saying: 'Islam has shackled it' is a beautiful metonymy for repentance, adhering to the limits of Islam, and knowing the lawful and forbidden. This example in this chapter is sufficient, Allah willing. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Balance (Muwazana)**",

    "text": "This is when the poet brings a verse where the number of words in its first half equals the number of words in the last half, and the parts are equal. If anything of its parts changes when scanned, or increases or decreases, balance is not achieved. Likewise, if the parts are equal but the words change by increase or decrease. This is hardly achieved by a poet except after knowing Prosody. As for it occurring coincidentally without intent, its occurrence is not counted, though the occurrence of that in Arab poetry without intent is frequent.\nMu'aqqir al-Bariqi said:\n'They passed by the ropes of the tents, so repelled them... men with the tips of spears, kindlers [of war].'\nIts scansion:\nWa marru bi-atnabil buyuti faraddahum\nFa'ulun Mafa'ilun Fa'ulu Mafa'ilun\nRijalun bi-atrafir rimahi masa'iru\nFa'ulun Mafa'ilun Fa'ulu Mafa'ilun\nAl-Kindi said:\n'We have sheep we drive, abundant... as if the horns of their large ones are sticks.'\nIts scansion:\nLana ghanamun nusawwiquha ghizarun\nMufa'alatun Mufa'alatun Fa'ulun\nKa'anna quruna jillatiha 'isiyyu\nMufa'alatun Mufa'alatun Fa'ulun\nAnother said:\n'To whom belongs a relic that became desolate... for Salma at Dhat al-Ghada?'\nIts scansion:\nLi-man dimnatun aqfarat\nFa'ulun Fa'ulun Fa'al\nLi-Salma bi-dhatil ghada\nFa'ulun Fa'ulun Fa'al\nFrom the poetry of the Jinn:\n'Did the dispersion of the tribe's unity grieve you... so you are sleepless for it, in pain?'\nThis verse has equal words and parts, except that its first half ends at the first Ya of 'al-Hayy', and the second Ya remained with the last half, so it exited the condition of balance.\nIts scansion:\nAshajaka tashattutu sha'bil hay-\nFa'ilun Fa'ilun Fa'ilun Fa'lun\n-yi fa-anta lahu ariqun wasibu\nFa'ilun Fa'ilun Fa'ilun Fa'ilun\nIf the words were equal and the two halves of the verse were similar, but something of the parts changed, the balance would be invalid, like the poet's saying:\n'He benefited so he gave, and ruled so he led... and led so he increased, and returned so he excelled.'\nFa'ulu Fa'ulu Fa'ulu Fa'ulu... Fa'ulu Fa'ulu Fa'ulu Fa'ulun\nSo it exited the condition because of the shift from Fa'ulu to Fa'ulun. Likewise, if the parts were equal but words increased or decreased, the condition would be invalid. As the poet said:\n'If you cannot do a thing, leave it... and surpass it to what you can do.'\nThe first half is more than the last by a word, though its parts are equal.\nIts scansion:\nIdha lam tastati' shay'an fa-da'hu\nMafa'ilun Mafa'ilun Fa'ulun\nWa jawizhu ila ma tastati'u\nMafa'ilun Mafa'ilun Fa'ulun\nThis is a convincing example in this chapter. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Paronomasia (Tajnis)**\nIt is when the poet brings two words coupled, close in weight, not distant in organization, not repelling to understanding, accepted by hearing, and nature does not recoil from them. If he increases in paronomasia and makes it three-fold, that is a corruption in craft because two words correspond and the other stands alone without a pair. Some people might approve something of that due to frequent usage and familiarity of hearing, like the saying of Al-Ta'i:\n'Salim (Greet) upon the quarter of Salma at Dhi Salam.'\nHis saying: 'Salim' and 'Salam' are two corresponding words, and the word 'Salma' stood alone without a pair. But due to the familiarity of hearing with the name Salma, Salam, and Salam, it became as if it were one thing. If he had made it four-fold, the correspondence would have been valid, even if the words were heavy on the hearing and heart, and affectation appeared on them. An example of four-fold is if he had said:\n'Salim salamta ala Salma bi Dhi Salam.'\nAs Muslim bin al-Walid said describing wine:\n'Sullat wa sullat thumma sulla saliluha... fa-ata salilu saliliha maslula.'\nHe means it was extracted (sullat) from its vine as grapes, then extracted from its grapes as wine, then the wine was extracted from its jar. It was also said he meant its refinement and that it became consumptive (maslula) from consumption (sill) which is the illness. There is no increase upon the ugliness of this verse. Al-Asma'i used to find the poet's saying repugnant:\n'Fa-ma lil-nawa, jadda al-nawa, qata'a al-nawa... kadhaka al-nawa qatta'atun li-wisali.'\nHe used to say: 'If Allah empowered a sheep over this verse, it would eat its date pits (nawa) and relieve people of it.'\nIshaq al-Mawsili recited to Al-Asma'i his saying:",

    "text": "'O Sarha (tree) of water whose sources are blocked... Is there a path to you that is not blocked?\nFor a hovering one (ha'im) who hovered (hama) until there is no hovering (hiyam) in him... driven away from the water path, expelled.'\nAl-Asma'i said: 'You did well in the poetry, except that these Ha's, if they gathered in Ayat al-Kursi, would have flawed it.' We narrated from some Sheikhs that he used to say: 'The likeness of paronomasia in a verse is like a single mole on the cheek; if it increases, it moves from being appreciated to being ugly, and might obliterate the beauties of the face.' In Al-Ta'i's verse is a good craft, which is returning its Arud (first hemistich end) to its Sadr (beginning). Paronomasia is divided into sections, among them:\na - Pure Paronomasia (Al-Tajnis Al-Mahd). The meaning of Mahd is pure, as if it is from one origin in the sound of its letters. Fresh milk is called Mahd because water has not mixed with it. Abu Hayya al-Bajali said:\n'They are prepared for the enemies (Al-'Ida) by youths of a charger (Adiya)... and every broad-armed, determined (Sihmim) middle-aged man.'\nHis saying: Al-'Ida and Adiya is pure paronomasia, and his saying: Yu'idduha (prepares it) for Al-'Ida is resembling paronomasia. Sihmim is one who is not turned away from his desire. Miskin bin Nadr al-Bajali said:\n'And the place of saddle-blankets of her was likened... to the rock (Safa) of a paved [road], the surface (Jadad) of the smooth rock (Safa').'\nAl-Safa is the smooth rock, and Al-Safa' is the clear smoothness. He also said:\n'So I said to him: Standing has prolonged and allowed... the coupling (Qaruna) of whom you coupled (Qaranta), and the shadow is familiar.\nAnd if he meets grace, she met with a dweller... generous, and a brave one (Zawl) if calamities befell.'\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'And indeed Tamim, his mother did not seek... health for him in his cradle with amulets (Tama'im).'\nAntara said:\n'As if she, on the day she turned away not speaking to us... was a fawn at 'Usfan, languid of eye (Saji al-Tarf), struck [in the eye] (Matruf).'\nSudayf said:\n'With chests advanced (Muqaddamat) of old (Qadiman)... and heads like great vessels (Qamaqim), big-headed (Ru'as).\nThey supported religion with thrusting until it became... clear of path after the inclination of the props (Awasi).'\nYazid bin Jad'a' said:\n'And they attacked in the morning another [group], Dirar and his band... and they left the wounded in the brain (Ma'mum) while he is wounded (Amim).'\nAl-Ma'mum is one who raves from the wound of his head, and Al-Amim is a stone with which the head is crushed.\nYazid bin Abd al-Madan al-Harithi said:\n'Did you ally with Jarm against us in hatred... your enmity is without crime (Jurm) nor blood.\nSufficed us against you our edge (Hadduna) and our iron (Hadiduna)... and a palm, whenever it seeks revenge, it avenges.'\nJarm is a tribe, and his saying 'without Jurm' means without sin. 'Hadduna' means our might, taken from the edge of the sword. 'Hadiduna' means our strength. 'Kafana' (sufficed us) and 'Kaff' (palm) is from the chapter of Variant Paronomasia, and it will be mentioned. Another said:\n'Ramim departed and her rope became worn (Rimama)... and she obeyed regarding you he who incited and he who cut.'\nRamim is a woman's name. Among it:\nb - Verbal Paronomasia (Tajnis al-Lafz), and they might call it Absolute (Al-Mutlaq). Jarir said:\n'You drove away a sick one who sees for his cure... a watering place (Wird), and is prevented if he desires arrival (Wurud).'\nIn it is paronomasia and antithesis. Dhu al-Rumma said:\n'You see the wild ass, the white-flanked one of them, like a hater (Farik)... her mate addressed (Tasadda) her eyes so she turned away (Saddat).'\nHer mate is the subject. 'Tasadda' and 'Saddat' is verbal paronomasia, corresponding in meaning because addressing is the opposite of turning away. Al-Afwah al-Awdi said:\n'And I cross the desert (Hawjal) seeking familiarity... with a swift (Hawjal), active, strong she-camel.'\nAl-Hawjal is the vast desert, and Al-Hawjal is the fast she-camel. Al-Nabigha said:\n'And I cross the desert (Kharq) with the Kharqa' (clumsy/fast camel) that has begun... after fatigue to complain of tiredness and weariness.'\nMiskin al-Darimi said:\n'And I cross the desert (Kharq) with the Kharqa' playfully... when the stars were lamps in the darkness.'\nAl-Kharq is the great desert, and Al-Kharqa' is the she-camel that traverses in running. Al-Qutami said:\n'A victim of beauties who pleased them and they pleased him... since he grew up (Shabba) until the black forelocks turned gray (Shaba).'\nShabba and Shaba is verbal paronomasia, and it is antithesis because they are opposites of youth and gray hair. Ali bin Jabala said:\n'And he returned the white swords (Al-Bid) and the white women (Al-Bid)... to the sheaths and the veils.'",

    "text": "He says: He sufficed war with his awe and protected women with his might. This is a verse of good Correspondence (Muqabala) because the first 'Bid' are swords, so he began the second hemistich by mentioning sheaths, and the second 'Bid' are women, so he delayed what relates to them which is veils. Ibn Ahmar said:\n'We wore its joy until we were demanded (uqtudina)... by deeds, and deadlines were decreed (qudina).'\nIt was said: Iqtida' is demanding, and Qada' is performance. So the wording is paronomasia, and the meaning is application (Tatbiq). It is possible that 'qudina' means estimated and known, so it would be verbal paronomasia only, which is more likely to me than the first. Al-Quhayf said:\n'And how, when no crow runs with estrangement (Ghurba)... nor are the intimates mentioned except he becomes confused (Taballada).'\nAsma' bin Kharija said:\n'Indeed I ask every possessor of medicine (Tibb)... what is the cure for the passion of the lover (Sabb)?'\nHe also said:\n'Since there is nothing but blades we strike with... and our saddles and the mounts of the rider (Rakb).'\nAl-Quhayf said:\n'Greetings (Hayyan) and life (Hayat) whose soldiers do not harm... an innocent, and single out the sinful aggressor.'\nSa'd bin al-Ghurayr al-Ansari said:\n'Is he free, pure-bred, or a mixed breed (Hajin), base... his mother goes early to the drinker and goes late?'\nAbu Jilda said:\n'And you committed sins in error... and you wept for the unjust (Zalim) the oppressed (Mazlum).'\nThe unjust is the opposite of the oppressed, and they are derived from injustice (Zulm); paronomasia and antithesis. Al-Qutami said:\n'And upon you is Asma' bin Kharija who... knew ('Alima) the deed and taught ('Allama) the youths.'\n'Alima and 'Allama is verbal paronomasia corresponding in meaning because 'Alima is accepting something and 'Allama is giving it, and giving is the opposite of accepting because this one took and this one gave. 'Uqal bin Hashimi al-Qayni said:\n'So the effort of people other than Banu Ali... is against me ('Alayya) when the fire throws sparks.'\nAmong it:\nc - Variant Paronomasia (Al-Tajnis Al-Mughayir): It is when the poet brings two words: one a noun and the other a verb, like His Almighty's saying: \"And I submitted (Aslamtu) with Solomon (Sulayman)\", and His Almighty's saying: \"Indeed I have turned (Wajjahtu) my face (Wajhiya)\", and His saying: \"The Approaching Day (Azifa) has approached (Azifat)\", and His saying: \"I will bring it to you before you stand (Taqum) from your place (Maqam)\", and His saying: \"We will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection (Qiyama) any weight\", and His saying: \"And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away (A'rada) and distances himself, and when evil touches him, then he is full of extensive (Arid) supplication.\" So 'A'rada' and 'Arid' is variant paronomasia. This paronomasia is appreciated by the people of Badi' in poetry and is very frequent. We only mention a small portion of it for familiarity and rest. Imru' al-Qais said:\n'The ambitious one (Tammah) aspired (Tamiha) from the distance of his land... to clothe me with his disease what he was clothed with.'\nAl-Shanfara said:\n'So we spent the night as if the house was stoned over us... with a wind (Rihana) that was blown (Rihat) in the evening and rained upon.'\nAl-Aqra' bin Mu'adh said:\n'And you are their hostage, and every living one... to a term, death (Sha'ub) will seize him (Satasha'buhu).'\nSha'ub is one of the names of death. Dhu al-Rumma said:\n'As if the rings and ivory, their backs were bent ('Ijat)... upon an 'Ushar tree with which a valley restrained (Nahha) the torrent.'\nAmr bin Khalid al-Taghlibi said:\n'They caught up on lean-flanked ones like spears... led (Qud) prepared for every day of raid.'\n'Uqal bin Hashim al-Qayni said:\n'Gray hair forbids (Yan-ha) he who has intellect (Nuha)... and clemency scolds his ignorance so he becomes dignified.'\nHe also said:\n'Wide-eyed like a wild oryx, a tender wide-eyed one inclined (Saraha)... to the coverts of the wild cows (Siran).'\nSaraha means inclined her. Surtu al-shay' asuruhu, and asartuhu means I inclined it. The noun is Sawar. Siran are wild cows. Al-Arji said:\n'And I travel by night when the lover is frightened by the night journey (Sura)... and I work the night of the swift working camels.'\nDurayd bin al-Simma said:\n'I advance the old camel ('Ud) before me and follow him... and I see myself, and the old camel ('Ud) does not walk with me.'\nAnother said:\n'Ibn Layla made the horses run (Jarra) while they were changing color... until they raided with the darkness when it darkened (Zulima).'\nAnother, who is from Banu Abs, said:\n'Convey to you, O Abu Sa'd, a message carried deep... that what is between us has died or become critically ill.'",

    "text": "'And that is because the humiliation of the neighbor allied with you... and that your nose does not disdain (Ta'nafu) disdain (Anafa).'\nAnother said:\n'And Umm Bakr came to us early (Bakarat) blaming us... and there is no great blame upon us in it.'\nTha'lab recited from Ammar bin Abi Tammam al-A'rabi:\n'Faq'as boasted (Tafaq'asa) until glory missed Faq'as... and Banu 'Ayya were incapable, and the misleader (Mudallil) was led astray (Dalla).'\nThese are tribes. Among it:\n\n**Proximate Paronomasia (Al-Tajnis Al-Muqarib)**\nIts meaning is that it approximates paronomasia but is not paronomasia, as Muhammad bin Abdul Malik al-Asadi said:\n'The mixture returned (Radda) she-camels and camels... and your neighbors wanted (Arada) separation in the morning.'\n'Radda' and 'Arada' resemble paronomasia due to proximity but are not paronomasia. Al-Qutami said:\n'As if all people are of one mother (Li-umm)... and we are for a cause ('Illah) that rose ('Alat) in elevation.'\nThe Bedouin said:\n'A brother of distance (Shiqqa) whom glory yearns for (Yashtaquhu) as an opportunity... to his family or a covenant not to be broken.'\nAbu Qais bin al-Aslat said:\n'I prepared for the enemies a flowing [coat of mail]... woven like a pool (Nahy) in the plain.'\nSimilar is the saying of Qais bin Zuhair:\n'They prepare for the enemies every swift mare... and short-haired, firm-fleshed, strong horse.'\nLabid said:\n'If it were other than me, O Sulayma, today... the impact of accidents would have changed him, except the sharp sword (Sarim), the male (Dhakir).'\nSulayma is a woman's name, vocative. Its meaning: If it were other than me, other than the sharp sword (Sarim Dhakir), the impact of accidents would have changed him. So he raised 'Sarim Dhakir' as an adjective. As was said:\n'And every brother, his brother parts from him... by the life of your father, except the two Farqad stars.'\nSa'id bin Abdul Rahman bin Hassan said:\n'I rectified his stumble after... the clients conspired (Tamala) to kill him.'\nKa'b al-Ashqari said:\n'And we turned (Durna) as the mill turns on its axis... and the swords poured (Darrat) upon the heads of men.'\nZuhair bin Abi Sulma said:\n'As if my eye, when the valley (Salil) flowed (Sala) with them... and neighbors, what are they if they are nations.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz included this verse in Pure Paronomasia. I did not see it from that chapter because 'Salil' is from 'Insilal' which is exiting from a thing, as you say 'Insalla al-rajul' from his clothes if he exits from them. And 'Sala al-ma' yasilu' (water flowed) is from 'Saylan' which is running, and from it is 'Sayl' (torrent) which is rushing water. This paronomasia is proximate, similar, not pure. Ibn Qudama followed Ibn al-Mu'tazz in that. Rakkad al-Asadi said:\n'She saw you driving (Tusiru) the caravan in the intensity (Sawra) of the forenoon... to her, so she said: The hearing of my ear is its sayer.'\n'Tusiru' and 'Sawra' is proximate to paronomasia. Among it:\n\n**Semantic Paronomasia (Tajnis al-Ma'na)**\nIt is when the poet brings words whose meaning indicates the genus even if he does not mention it. The poet said praising Al-Muhallab:\n'He sang to Abu Umm al-Ri'al (Ostrich's father) so his Ostrich fled... from a cloud raining.'\nHe mentions Al-Muhallab's action with Qatari bin al-Fuja'a. Qatari was nicknamed Abu Na'ama (Father of Ostrich). He wanted to say: 'He sang to Abu Na'ama so his Ostrich fled', meaning his soul, but it did not fit, so he said 'Abu Umm al-Ri'al', the ostrich, which is the plural of Ri'l. Hurayth bin Muhaffid al-Mazini said:\n'If he comes to us, Suwayd returns and his face... upon it are bubbles of dust (Ghubra) and darkness (Qatam).'\nHe wanted to say: Blackness (Sawad) [pun on Suwayd], but he couldn't, so he said 'Ghubra' and 'Qatam', and they are black. Al-Shamakh said:\n'And no female mountain goat (Arwa), even if she is dear to us... is closer than a stopped, stubborn one.'\nIt is narrated 'Hazun' (rugged), meaning she is in the rugged ground, which is what is rough and elevated of the earth. Arwa is a woman. The stopped, stubborn one is a female mountain goat (Arwiyya) of the wild, and the woman was named after her. He couldn't bring her name so he brought her description, as if he said: And not this Arwa is closer than the Arwiyya of the wild. Al-Kindi said:\n'Say to Dudan, slaves of the stick... what deceived you regarding the brave lion?'\nDudan is from Banu Asad (Sons of Lion). They are called Slaves of the Stick. It is as if he wanted: Say to Banu Asad, what deceived you regarding the brave lion (Asad). Al-Matrud al-Khuza'i said:\n'Those striking the ram whose helmet shines... and preventing the white women (Bid) with swords (Asyaf).'",

    "text": "This verse has several facets: Among them is speckling (Talmi'), which is 'striking' and 'preventing'. Among them is verbal paronomasia, which is 'Bayd' (helmet) and 'Bid' (white women). And semantic paronomasia, which is 'Bid' meaning women, and 'Asyaf' plural of 'Sayf' in paucity, and the swords are white (Bid). It is as if he wanted to say: And preventing the white women (Bid) with the white [swords] (Bid), but it did not fit for him, so he said: And preventing the white women with swords. Among it:\n\n**The Aspiring Paronomasia (Al-Mujannas Al-Mutmi')**\nIt is when the poet brings a word then starts its sister in accordance with its letters, making one aspire (yutmi') that he will bring its like, then substitutes a letter for a letter at its end. It is beautiful in paronomasia. Al-Hutay'ah said:\n'Piercing (Mata'in) in war, feeding (Mata'im) in darkness... their fathers built for them and the grandfather built.'\nMuzarrid said:\n'Every herd visits Salma's house in the evening... jet-black (Gharabib) like the barefoot, quick (Hawafid) Indian women.'\nAbu Kadra' al-'Ijli said:\n'I rose to a Mashrafi iron... newly polished (Hadith), transmitted, a sharp sword.'\nAl-Khatim al-Muhrizi said:\n'Nights of a month I do not stop for rest (U'arris) for an hour... and days of a month I do not turn aside (U'arrij), diligent.'\nHe made one aspire that he would make a pun with 'U'arris', so he said 'U'arrij', substituting Jim for Sin. The wording is aspiring paronomasia, and the meaning is antithesis, because Ta'ris is at the end of the night and Ta'rij is at the end of the day. Abu Bakr bin Hanzala al-Anzi said:\n'Gaining (Mufid), losing (Mufit), my dirhams do not come... when they come, except as wayfarers.'\nThis is aspiring paronomasia corresponding in meaning and wording, because the Mufid is the gatherer and the Mufit is the scatterer. Among it:\n\n**The Substituted Paronomasia (Al-Tajnis Al-Mubdal)**\nIt is close to the Aspiring. Al-Zibraqan bin Badr said:\n'Knights of truth in the morning when... shouting increases and clamor in the group (Nafr).'\nHe substituted Ya for Ba [in text seems unrelated to Nafr? Perhaps referring to another word not cited or typo in source analysis. The example 'Nafr' doesn't show substitution clearly here without context or comparison]. Alqama bin Abada said:\n'You obeyed the slanderers (Wushat) and the walkers (Mushat) in cutting her off... so her ropes have weakened for breaking.'\nHe substituted Waw for Mim. Al-'Udayl said:\n'A brother of distance worn out by the night journey (Dalaj)... spends the night seeking concern (Hamm) every seeking.'\nHe substituted Fa for Qaf. [Note: Text says 'Hamm' then says substituted Fa for Qaf? The example doesn't match the description. Perhaps 'Maraam' vs something else?]. Khufaf bin Nadba said:\n'With the one restraining (Dabit), the stretching (Dabi')... when the horses flagged and the possessor of witness.'\nHe substituted Ayn for Ta. Jawwas bin al-Qa'tal said:\n'I witnessed for her, while Abu Burayd was absent (Ghaba)... assemblies, if the Sheikh saw them he would be jealous (Ghara).'\nGhaba and Ghara; he substituted Ra for Ba. Amr bin Sha's said:\n'We are those who for our clemency have merit (Fadl)... of old, and with our orator is judgment (Fasl).'\nHe substituted Sad for Dad. Imran bin Hittan said:\n'If you lead him, you lead a strong (Shadid), correct (Sadid)... for he walks like the walk of the arrogant.'\nHe substituted Sin for Shin. Ka'b bin Ju'ayl said:\n'So she permits (Tasmahu) me tears out of sadness for his memory... and sheds (Tasfahu) from it neither little nor scarce.'\nHe substituted Fa for Mim. Abu Hayya al-Numayri said:\n'And as if mounds (Kuthub), trembling (Rawajif)... from the sky of locusts, were made buttocks (Rawadif) for them.'\nJurad is the name of a sand dune. He substituted Jim in Rawajif for Dal in Rawadif. Al-Mulayh al-Hudhali said:\n'Is it in quarters in which the wind has a path (Madraj)... and a morning path on their known places and a night path (Madlaj)?'\nHe substituted Lam in Madlaj for Ra in Madraj. Ma'n bin Aws said:\n'And I said (Qultu) when she stood (Qamat) and spoke and turned away... dragging a new [robe] of silk and a body-garment.'\nHe substituted Lam in Qalat for Mim in Qamat. Poetry in this chapter is abundant, and in the examples we mention and others is sufficiency for whoever wants, Allah Almighty willing. Among it:\n\n**The Differing Paronomasia (Al-Mujannas Al-Mukhtalif)**\nAl-Yazidi recited to me:\n'With vines, full moons, and spears (Qana)... swaying over the dunes of the sand hill (Naqa).'\nQana and Naqa is differing paronomasia. Al-Harith bin Khalid al-Makhzumi said:\n'And I fell in love among them in the morning with a tender one... of slender build, twisted like the twisting (Jadl) of a rein.'\nAbu Dahbal said:\n'There was in the family of Moses before him a body... a calf ('Ijl), when it lowed among them a lowing, they prostrated.'\nHumayd bin Thawr said:\n'We place the visit where the honor (Sharaf) of kings... does not disgrace us, nor do the visitors appear disappointed.'",

Do you not know that there can be honor below honor without disgracing us? I said: This is an explanation as you see. But what Abu Tammam al-A'rabi went to is an acceptable face. Among the best of what is narrated in this chapter is the saying of Al-Ta'i:\n'White of blades (Safa'ih), not black of pages (Saha'if)... in their texts is the clearing of doubt and suspicion.'\nAmong it:\n\n**Script Paronomasia (Tajnis al-Khat)**\nIt is called Tashif (Misreading). It is when two words appear and are not distinguished except by dots. Allah Almighty said: \"And they think (yahsabuna) that they are doing good (yuhsinuna) work.\" Urwa bin Jandal al-Faq'asi said:\n'Nights when the causes of affection between us... despite stinginess (Bukhl), were sweeter to us than the harvest of bees (Nahl).'\nBukhl and Nahl is script paronomasia. Al-Farazdaq said:\n'You played (Azafta) at A'shash and almost did not refrain (Ta'zifu)... and you denied of Hadra' what you used to know (Ta'rifu).'\nTa'zifu and Ta'rifu is script paronomasia. Abu Du'ad al-Iyadi said:\n'I arrived on a strong, bulky she-camel... so she sipped cool water (Simalan) and the north wind (Shimalan) blew.'\nAl-Afwah al-Awdi said:\n'Until he bent from me the spear of the back... and masked the head with a mixed color (Khalis).'\nIbn Qais al-Ruqayyat said:\n'They returned from you blaming, so everyone... went from you sad, robbed (Hariba).'\nBal'a' bin Qais said:\n'To a garden in which are trefoil (Nafal) and herbs (Baql)... the flies sing in its beds.'\nNafal and Baql is script paronomasia. Ubayd bin Mawiya al-Ta'i said:\n'And Nu'm, with what she sent her mind (Balaha)... and obtained the greeting whoever obtained it (Nalaha).\nAnd I am possessor of bitter strength... if a state rides its state (Halaha).'\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'And the healers did not find like our blood... a cure, nor the cupbearers from the honey of bees (Nahl).'\n\n**And from it is Partial Paronomasia (Tajnis al-Ba'd):**\nAl-Qutami said:\n'More beautiful than Jumana the day they returned... the camels (Jimal) of separation and departed by day.'\nJumana and Jimal is partial paronomasia. He also said:\n'And it was a blow from a wide-mouthed one... when the camels ran (Istannat) rising high (Istina'a).'\nIstannat and Istina'a is partial paronomasia.

Ka'b bin Zuhair said:\n'And you knew, while you are not forbearing... that passion does not bring me near to humiliation (Hawan).'\nFrom the beautiful of this section of paronomasia is the saying of Al-Ta'i; Abdul Rahman al-Wasiti informed me by my reading to him, he said: Ibn Khayrun told me from Al-Jawhari and Ibn al-Muslima, they said: Al-Marzubani told us from his Sheikhs, he said: Umara bin Aqil bin Bilal bin Jarir asked the companions of Abu Tammam to recite some of his poetry, so they recited to him:\n'If Lujaym bridled (Aljamat) Lujaym one day and around it... were Banu al-Hisn, the offspring of chaste, noble women.\nFor deaths, sharp swords, and spears... are their relatives in fear, instead of relatives.\nWhen the horses traversed the dust of the battle, they cracked... the chests of the upper spears in the chests of the battalions.\nThey extend from disobeying (Awasi), protecting (Awasim) hands... attacking with destroying (Qawadi), cutting (Qawadib) swords.'\nUmara said: 'To Allah is his goodness! As if his returns (raddat) are the returns of Jarir.' He called paronomasia 'returns'. His saying: 'Awasi and Awasim, and Qawadi and Qawadib is of the appreciated completed paronomasia. Among it:\n\n**Rhyme Paronomasia (Tajnis al-Qawafi)**\nAl-Nabigha al-Dhubyani said:\n'You see the desirous ones clinging to his door... upon every walnut bowl filled with humps (Ara'ir).\nHe has in the courtyard of the house a black, dark pot... swallowing the limbs of the huge (Ura'ir) slaughtered camel.'\nAra'ir are humps, and Ura'ir is huge and big. Qais bin Zuhair said:\n'I think clemency guided my people against me... and the forbearing (Halim) man may be treated as ignorant.\nAnd how many men have I practiced in my time... refusers, whom dreams (Hulum) do not miss.'\nHalim: The man of clemency, and Hulum: plural of Hulm (dream). Since the meaning differed, the proximity between the two words became good. Al-Arji said:\n'You named me worn-out (Khalaq) for a suit that wore out... and there is no new if the worn (Khalaq) is not worn.\nReturn to the truth if you were saying it... indeed fabrication (Takhalluq) comes short of character (Khuluq).'\nA'sha of Banu Abi Rabi'a said:\n'Abu al-Is, Al-Asi, and Harb, and there was no... brother like Abu Amr by whom the back (Azr) is strengthened.\nThe honors were pure from them from every suspicion... feared, and the waist-wrappers (Uzr) were good in their tying places.'\nAmr bin Imri' al-Qais al-Ansari said:\n'I opposed in opinion every possessor of debauchery... O Mal, and the truth is other than what we describe (Nasifu).\nWe walk to death from our anger... a rapid walk, and our judgment is half (Nasafu).'\nNasifu from Wasf (description), and Nasafu from Nasafa (justice/half). Ashyam bin Shurahbil said:\n'If you ask Tamim about their evils... then seek Usayyid until you catch the predecessor (Salafa).\nLike slave girls, when a clamor bites... they do not gamble easily nor do you meet advancing food (Sulafa) for them.'\nSalaf is the past, and Sulaf is the little food presented before lunch, singular Sulafa with Damma. From that is their saying 'Sallaftu al-rajul taslifan' (I gave the man an advance), and if you fed him something hastened before his lunch. Ibn Abdal al-Asadi said:\n'And indeed I become rich but do not become arrogant in wealth... and I offer my kindness to one seeking my offer ('Ardi).\nAnd I become insolvent sometimes so my difficulty intensifies... and I attain the ease of wealth while my honor ('Irdi) is with me.'\nJumana al-Absiya said:\n'My father does not see that he be robbed of his armor today... and my grandfather sees that he take the armor from my father.'",

    "text": "'So my father's opinion is the opinion of the miser with his money... and my grandfather's nature is the nature of the refusing swearer.'\nIbn al-A'rabi recited:\n'His drink (Shirab) is like cutting with razors... neither quenching nor consoling (Muwasi).'\nHe meant by his drink his drinking partnership. Abu Dahbal said:\n'Is it not precious that you are in a town... both of us residing in it and we do not speak?\nA pampered woman, if an ant crawled on her skin... the crawling of the ant on the skin would almost wound (Yuklamu).'\nAmr bin Qami'a said:\n'Those are my people, the family of Sa'd bin Malik... they conspired on grudge against me and oppression (Ilghaf).\nSo all people are closer today than them... to me, even if they were Oman, possessors of the Ghaf tree.'\nIlghaf is injustice and oppression, and his saying: Possessors of Ghaf means owners of the tree. Al-Mada'ini recited for Al-Khalil bin Ahmad:\n'O woe to my heart from the motives of passion... when the neighbors departed at sunset (Ghurub).\nI followed them with my glance and they had gone far... and the overflow of my eyes was like the overflow of buckets (Ghurub).\nThey departed and among them was a free, tender woman... smiling revealing hidden hail [teeth] of the spathe (Ghurub).'\nThe first Ghurub is sunset, the second is plural of Gharb which is a large bucket, and the third is the spathe (Kufurra) which is the spadix. Abu al-Abbas Tha'lab recited:\n'Do you know ruins that saddened you at Al-Khal... and the life of a time that was in the past (Khali) age?\nNights when the prime of youth was empowered... over me with disobedience to the commanding [soul] and arrogance (Khal).\nAnd when I was a friend to the seducer, brother of youth... and to the flirt, the windy, possessor of amusement and unmarried state (Khal).\nNights, Tukna captivates me with her coquetry... and with the enchanting look, the cheek, and the mole (Khal).\nIf she inhabited a quarter, you loved its quarters... just as the soft meadow is loved by the abundant rain, the thundercloud (Khali).\nAnd a soft one in his coquetry leads me from her... just as a colt is led when the groom (Khali) tames it.'\nThe first Khal is a place, the second is the past, the third is vanity, the fourth is one with no wife, the fifth is the black mole, the sixth is one with no helper, and the seventh is the one who tends to animals. Among it:\n\n**Similar Paronomasia (Al-Tajnis Al-Mumathil)**\nIt is when the two words are two nouns or two verbs, as Allah Almighty said: \"Fa-rawhun wa rayhan\" (Then rest and basil), two nouns. And as His Almighty's saying: \"Wa jana al-jannatayni dan\" (And the picking of the two gardens is near). And His Almighty's saying: \"Ya asafa ala Yusuf\" (O my sorrow over Joseph). And as the Prophet's saying (peace be upon him): \"Al-Zulmu zulumat yawm al-qiyama\" (Injustice is darknesses on the Day of Judgment). And his saying (peace be upon him): \"The two-faced one will not be a notable (Wajih) on the Day of Judgment.\" Jarir said:\n'So Iqal ceased not to be hobbled (Ma'qul) from generosity... and a restrainer (Habis) ceased not to be restrained (Mahbus) from good.'\nAl-Nabigha al-Dhubyani said:\n'She said: I see you as a brother of a saddle and a mount... covering wastelands that will not wait for you (Yanzirnaka) for old age.'\nSuhaym bin Wathil al-Riyahi said:\n'And indeed my peer does not return to me... on the morning of the day after (Ghibb) except in a horn (Qarin).'\nMeaning with him another. Another said:\n'Nights of Layla, her sweet water was not mixed... with salt, and her two ropes, their strands are strong.'\nMeaning the rope of her affection for him and the rope of his affection for her. Al-Ajjaj said:\n'And the daughter of Abbas, the chief of Abs... in a stock (Qins) of glory above every stock (Qins).'\nQins is the origin of everything and its root. Al-Udayl bin al-Farkh al-Ijli said:\n'At Khala she visited us, so her phantom was stirred... and she visited at Huwwarin while he is Levantine (Sha'am).'\nYazid bin Hudhayfa al-Asadi said:\n'We repelled Tarif with our tips (Atraf)... and with the palm (Rah) from us, and they did not repel us.'\nWe have cited of the sections of Jinah (Paronomasia) what contains sufficiency and indication to others, so measure it and adopt it, Allah Almighty willing. From the titles we previously mentioned in poetry:\n\n**Chapter of Correspondence (Mutabaqa) / Antithesis**\nScholars have differed regarding Tibaq (Antithesis). Al-Akhfash said when asked about it: I find people differing on Tibaq. A group, which is the majority, claims that it is mentioning a thing and its opposite, joined by the wording not the meaning. And a group opposes that and says: It is the sharing of two meanings in a single word, like the saying of Ziyad al-A'jam:",

    "text": "'And I was informed they seek victory through Kahil... and for meanness among them is a wither (Kahil) and a hump.'\nHis saying 'through Kahil': meaning the tribe, and his saying 'Kahil' for the limb is correspondence according to them. He said: This is paronomasia. He said: Whoever claims it is Tibaq has opposed Al-Asma'i and Al-Khalil. It was said to him: Did they know this? He said: Glory be to Allah, is there anyone like them in the knowledge of poetry and distinguishing its bad from its good?! Some people included in Tibaq a type of Division (Taqsim), like the saying of Ka'b bin Sa'd:\n'Indeed, as for his clemency, it is relieved... upon us, and as for his ignorance, it is distant.'\nWhen they saw the mention of clemency and ignorance, and relieved and distant, they placed it in correspondence, and it was not far from it, but it is closer to the chapter of Division. Al-Asma'i said: The origin of Tibaq is that the horse places its hind leg in the place of its foreleg, and he recited:\n'And horses that match (Yutabiqna) with the armored men... the matching (Tibaq) of dogs treading the rugged ground.'\nAl-Khalil said: I matched (Tabaqtu) between two things if I gathered them on one pattern and attached them. I say: Tibaq is one of the best beauties of Badi'; it is when the poet brings the thing and its opposite in the verse. Abdullah bin al-Zubayr al-Asadi said:\n'Events threw the women of the family of Harb... with a decree for which they stood bewildered (Samadna Sumuda).\nSo it returned their black hair white... and returned their white faces black.'\nZuhair said:\n'A scattered lion hunting men when... the lion lied about his peers, he was truthful.'\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'May God curse Banu Kulayb, for they... neither betray nor fulfill for a neighbor.\nThey wake up to the braying of their donkeys... and their eyes sleep from vengeance.'\nAl-Farazdaq took it from the saying of Thumamah al-Dhuhli:\n'A people whose eyes sleep from vengeance... but their foolish ones do not sleep from theft.'\nAmr bin Kulthum said:\n'That we bring the banners white... and issue them red, having been quenched.'\nIf Amr had said: 'From the thirsty spears, they arrive white... and we issue them red, having been quenched,' he would have been excellent and creative in Tibaq between bringing and issuing, whiteness and redness, and thirst and quenching. Abu al-Shis took the meaning of Amr's verse and completed what was missing from it, saying:\n'So he brought them white, thirsty in their chests... and issued them with quenching, their colors red.'\nSo his taking became appreciated due to the completeness of his meaning and addition with paronomasia in: 'Suduruha' (their chests) and 'Asdaraha' (he issued them). Al-Ghatammash al-Dabbi said:\n'If we travel between East and West... the awake of the dust and its sleeper move.'\nAl-Kumayt bin Zayd said:\n'And I see gray hair and youth as two robes... one preserved and one everyday garment spread out.'\nGray hair and youth, and preserved and everyday is application (Tatbiq), and in it is one metaphor. Abu Sakhr al-Hudhali said:\n'Nay, by the One who made weep and made laugh, and the One who... caused death and gave life, and the One whose command is the Command.'\nAws bin Maghra' said:\n'So the rope of affection between me and her wore out... and every new thing will become worn.'\nAbu Dahbal said:\n'And the spear of religion became in the hand of an oppressor... if a side of it bends, he does not straighten it.'\nIn it is Tibaq and a good metaphor. Abu Jilda al-Yashkuri said:\n'If she balances cutting off and connecting, a balance... of love, heavy, hinders her from cutting off.'\nIn it is Tibaq and metaphor. When he made a balance for love, he made the indicator verbal, which is his saying 'heavy' (Rajih). This section is vast and abundant, indicated by the little and easy. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Exportation (Tasdir)**\nSome call it: Returning the ends of speech to its beginnings. It is when the poet begins with a word in the verse then repeats it in its end, or half of it then returns it in the last half. If poetry is organized in this manner, extracting its rhymes becomes easy before they knock on the ears of its listeners. Al-Asma'i said: Of good Tasdir is the saying of Amir bin al-Tufayl, and so said a group of poetry critics:\n'So you were a hump in Fazara, high... and in every tribe is a peak and a hump.'\nSome said: Rather, of good Tasdir is the saying of Jarir:",

    "text": "'A black cloud pouring its white clouds watered the sand... and that is nothing but love for who settled in the sand.'\nOthers said: Rather, the saying of the first is of good Tasdir:\n'Quick to the cousin insulting his honor... and not quick to the caller of generosity.'\nPeople said: The saying of Ibn Ahmar is among the good of what was said in Tasdir, which is:\n'I sipped (Taghammartu) from her after youth ran out... and he who sips (Taghammara) is not quenched from a need.'\nTaghammur is little drinking. Al-Farazdaq said:\n'Issue (Asdir) your worries, let not their import kill you... for every import one day has an issue (Sadar).'\nAmong them:\n\n**Chapter of Apostrophe (Iltifat)**\nIt is turning from addressing to informing, and from informing to addressing. It is of the wondrous Badi'. Jarir said:\n'When were the tents at Dhu Tuluh?... May you be watered by rain, O tents.\nDo you remember the day she polished her cheeks... with a stick of Basham tree? The Basham was watered.'\nIt is also narrated: 'Do you forget when Sulayma bid us farewell... with a stick of Basham tree? The Basham was watered.'\nOf brilliant Iltifat is the saying of Al-Nabigha:\n'Did Banu Abs claim that I... No, they lied! Old of age, vanishing.'\nAnother said:\n'For if I miss you, there misses you from me... so do not be surpassed in it, a precious object.'\nKuthayyir said:\n'If the misers, and you are one of them... saw you, they would learn procrastination from you.'\nFrom this section is the interjection of speech within speech whose meaning is not complete, then the poet returns to it and completes it at once, which is of good Iltifat. Tarafa said:\n'So may the downpour of spring and pouring rain... water your dwellings, without spoiling them.'\nThe meaning was completed by his saying: 'without spoiling them'. Nafi' bin Khalifa al-Ghanawi said:\n'Men who, if the truth is not accepted from them... and given to them, sought refuge in cutting swords.'\nHe completed the meaning by his saying: 'and given to them'. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Digression (Istitrad)**\nThe meaning of Istitrad is the poet's exit from blame to praise or from praise to blame. The moderns have many wondrous poems in this chapter. Zuhair said:\n'Indeed the miser is blamed wherever he is, but... the generous one, despite his defects, is Harim.'\nHe digressed the speech to praising Harim. Al-Farazdaq said:\n'As if the anuses of Azd around Ibn Misma'... when they sweat, are the mouths of Bakr bin Wa'il.'\nHe digressed the speech to blaming Bakr bin Wa'il. Jarir threw dust in the face of the predecessor to this meaning, let alone who followed him, for he digressed with two in one verse, which is:\n'When I placed my brand on Al-Farazdaq... and Al-Ba'ith cried out, I cut off the nose of Al-Akhtal.'\nAl-Dhaghw and Al-Dugha' is the voice of the humiliated, conquered one. Another said:\n'You are the son of Bid, by my life I do not deny it... truly, certainly, but who is the father of Bid?'\nBakr bin al-Nattah said about Malik bin Tawq, which is a digression from praise to praise:\n'I offered her what she wanted of wishes... to please her, she said: Stand and bring me a star.\nSo I said to her: This obstinacy is all... like one who desires the flesh of a western Phoenix.\nAsk every matter whose seeking is upright... and do not go, O pearl, in every way.\nFor I swear, if I were in the glory of Malik... and his power, my demand would be impossible with what you aimed for.\nA youth whose wealth was miserable by his giving... just as Qais was miserable by the spears of Taghlib.'\nSimilar to these verses is what Al-Isfahani mentioned in his book, he said: Ahmad bin Ubaydullah bin Ammar said: We were at Al-Mubarrad's one day, and with him was a youth from the descendants of Abu al-Bakhtari Wahb bin Wahb the Judge, a handsome beardless boy, and a youth from the descendants of Abu Dulaf al-Qasim bin Isa al-Ijli resembling him in beauty. Al-Mubarrad said to Ibn Abi al-Bakhtari: 'I know a witty story of generosity for your grandfather, beautiful, not preceded.' The youth said: 'What is it?' He said: 'A man of letters was invited to some banquets and was given Nabidh other than what they were drinking. He said:\n\"Two Nabidhs in one assembly... for preferring a wealthy one over a poor one.",

    "text": "\"If your action was this in food... I would have adhered to your analogy in the intoxicant.\nBut if you were doing the deed of the noble... you would have done the deed of Abu al-Bakhtari.\nHe followed his brothers in the lands... so he enriched the poor from the wealthy.\"\nThe verses reached your grandfather, so he sent the man five hundred dinars.' Ibn Ammar said: I said: 'The grandfather of this youth has done in this meaning what is better than this.' Al-Mubarrad said: 'What is it?' I said: 'I heard that Ibn Abi Fanan became poor after wealth. His wife said to him: \"Enlist in the army.\" He recited saying:\n\"Away from me, for you have tasked me with excess... carrying weapons and saying to the house: 'Eye, stop.'\nDeaths walk to people and I hate them... so how can I walk to them with bare shoulder?\nI thought that the exhaustion of money changed me... or that my heart is in the sides of Abu Dulaf.\"\nAbu Dulaf summoned him and said to him: \"How much did your wife hope your provision would be?\" He said: \"One hundred dinars.\" He said: \"And how long did you hope to live?\" He said: \"Twenty years.\" He said: \"You have from me what you hoped and your wife hoped from my money, not the Sultan's money.\" And he ordered giving that to him. He said: I saw the face of Ibn Abi Dulaf beaming, and Ibn Abi al-Bakhtari was broken.' Another said:\n'We captured as our spears accustomed us... at the battle of the two cavalries, while the dust was rising.'\nHe informed that he captured an enemy and digressed the speech to [saying] that he is accustomed to that. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Division (Taqsim)**\nNusayb said:\n'I was not pleased with what she said, nor did I show anger... and my chest narrowed with what I mumbled of her love.\nSo a group of the tribe said: No. And a group of them... Yes. And a group said: Woe to you, we do not know.'\nThere is nothing in the answer of one who asked about something other than what he mentioned. This verse was narrated by Al-Akhfash according to what I established and know of his poetry:\n'So a group of the people said when I adjured them... Yes, and a group: By Allah's oath, we do not know.'\nAl-Shammakh said describing the hardness of the donkey's hooves and the intensity of his trampling the ground:\n'Whenever his pasterns fall settled... on a stone, it shatters or rolls away.'\nThere is nothing in the description of intense treading except that what is trodden upon is soft so it shatters, or hard so it rolls away. Zuhair said:\n'He spears them as long as they throw, until if they spear... he strikes, until if they strike, he embraces.'\nAntara said:\n'If they catch up, I attack again; if they pursue, I intensify; and if they are found in a tight spot, I dismount.'\nUmar bin Abi Rabi'ah al-Makhzumi said:\n'You wander for Nu'm, so neither is the reunion gathering... nor the rope connected, nor the love short.\nNeither is the nearness of Nu'm, if she approaches, beneficial to you... nor does her distance console, nor are you patient.'\nThe Kharijite took this meaning and said:\n'I belied my eye regarding you, while the eye is truthful... and I made my ear hear regarding you what it does not hear.\nAnd I did not inhabit the land which you inhabit... so that they would not say: Patient, he does not panic.\nSo neither does my grief end, nor is there mercy from you... nor holding back from you, nor hope in you.'\nQais bin Dharih said:\n'If the world has turned with Lubna... then Time and the world have bellies and backs.\nIndeed there was in it a place for trust... and a grazing ground for the heart and a view for the eye.\nAnd for the hovering thirsty one a quenching in her nearness... and for the strutting one trailing his robe a scent and an intoxicant.'\nThe people of the craft approved in this chapter the saying of Bashar bin Burd, which is:\n'With a strike that he who tastes its taste tastes death... and its defects overtake him whom flight saved.\nSo they went: a group in captivity, and its like... killed, and a like whose fleer sought refuge in the sea.'\nThey said: There is no addition to what he mentioned in describing one whom victory befell and the mill of war turned upon.

    "text": "A group of those who practice the science of Badi' and criticism of crafted poetry were asked about Tas'him, but none of them answered with an answer of understanding. Nothing was obtained from their indications to it and their texts on it except that the Musahham (arrowed) is that which the listener anticipates its rhymes before its narrator reaches them. I say: This title is not indicative of this meaning. If the titler intended strangeness by it, he missed the mark and deviated from the straightest path. Tas'him is striping, and the Musahham robe is the striped one. It would have been more appropriate to say: Tas'him in poetry is its beautification and refinement of its words and meanings, likening it to the robe beautified by striping, so that this type of poetry has its meaning reach your heart faster than its words reach your ear. If it were called Al-Mutmi' (The Aspiring)—meaning whoever hears it aspires to say the like of it, while he is far from that—it would be permissible. We have presented it as we heard and narrated it. Al-Akhfash said: Among the most brilliant of what was said in Tas'him is what Al-Janub, sister of Amr Dhi al-Kalb, said:\n'I swore, O Amr, if they alerted you... then they alerted from you an incurable disease.\nThen they alerted a lion of a thicket... destroying, benefiting souls and wealth.\nAnd a desert whose unknown you crossed... with a Kharqa' (she-camel) complaining of fatigue.\nSo you were the sun to it by day... and you were the crescent in it in the darkness of night.'\nThen he said: Look at the embroidery of this speech, how pure it is, and at its divisions, how complete they are. Look at her saying 'destroying, benefiting', and her description of him in the day as the sun and in the night as the crescent; you find the far, aspiring, impossible. In this small sufficiency of this chapter is enough, Allah Almighty willing. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Inlaying (Tarsi')**\nIt is called Checkering (Tafwif). Tarsi' in language is composition. From it is a crown inlaid (Murassa') with jewels, and a sword inlaid, meaning adorned with Rasai' (inlays), which are rings used for adornment, singular Rasi'a. The inlaid verse is the one in which associated parts follow successively as the crown is inlaid with jewels. From Tarsi' in the Glorious Quran is His Almighty's saying: \"And why should you not eat of that upon which the name of Allah has been mentioned, while He has explained in detail to you what He has forbidden you, excepting that to which you are compelled.\" And His Almighty's saying: \"Or has He not guided those who inherit the land after its people that if We willed We would strike them for their sins and seal over their hearts.\" Among good Tarsi' is the saying of Al-Khansa':\n'Praise is his nature, and generosity is his illness... and truth is his domain, if his peer feared.\nBlocker of breaches, attender of assemblies... crosser of valleys, seeker of vengeance.\nBearer of banners, striker of buildings... arrive at water-wheels, usurper in war.\nPoison of enemies, releaser of captives, when... he met the battle he was not fearful of death.\nGood he does, and speech he prefers... and wealth he plunders in right a plundering.\nHe guides the patrol if the path deviates with them... high of neck, rider of blue spears.'\nShe also said:\n'Refuser of oppression, bearer of the great matter... waster of the precious, neither falling nor weak.\nProtector of the truth, traveler of the intense heat... liberator of the driven herd, sturdy not weak.\nDescender of valleys, bearer of banners... attender of assemblies, wolf of youths.'\nShe also said:\n'Sharp of spearhead, eloquent of tongue... rewarding the lender the likes of it.'\nShe also said:\n'Bearer of a burden, rider of a dilemma... giver of a favor, mender of bone.\nProtector of the truth, praised of path... driver of the driven herd, beneficial and harmful.'\nImru' al-Qais said:\n'The water is pouring, and the run is descending... and the flank is lean, and the back is smooth.'\nZiyad said:\n'Black are their tresses, white are their chests... full are their elbows, in their creation is abundance of hair.'\nIn it, along with Tarsi', is Tibaq (antithesis). Dhu al-Rumma said:\n'White in blackness of eyes, yellow in whiteness of skin... as if she is silver touched by gold.'",

    "text": "This is a verse that combined Antithesis, Inlaying, and Simile. Bashama al-Nahshali said, and it is narrated for another:\n'White are our partings, boiling are our pots... we heal with our wealth the traces of our hands.'\nI saw in the handwriting of Sheikh Abu Zakariya al-Tabrizi a book in which Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Khatib extracted over two hundred faces in his saying 'White are our partings' alone, and he constructed the building of those meanings with Arabic poems and accepted words. Another said:\n'Long of sword-belt, high of pillar... much of ash, and the night is cold.'\nAl-Harithi said:\n'She visited, greeted, then stood and bid farewell... when she turned away, the soul almost perished.'\nTarsi' in poetry is more numerous than the number of raindrops. Among it:\n\n**Chapter of Repetition (Tardid)**\nIt is when the poet attaches a word in the verse with a meaning, then repeats it in it itself and attaches it with another meaning. The critics agreed that Abu Hayya al-Numayri preceded in this excellence all who came before him and after him with his saying:\n'Hey, greet for the sake of the beloved the dwellings... they wore decay from what the nights wore.\nIf a day and a night demand payment from a man... something demands him that does not tire of demanding.'\nHe began in the first hemistich and excelled in beginning, and repeated in the second hemistich and excelled in repetition. Abu Tammam al-Ta'i said: I do not know anyone with better craft in repetition than the saying of Zuhair:\n'Whoever meets Harim one day despite his conditions... meets generosity from him and nobility as a character.'\nIt is narrated: 'If you meet... you meet generosity'. Al-Asma'i said: This is the most praising verse the Arabs said. Abu Ali al-Hatimi said: Abu Nuwas excelled in repetition with his saying:\n'Yellow (wine), sorrows do not descend in its yard... if a stone touched it, joy would touch it.'\nHe also said:\n'He thought of me, he whom I became fond of... so he shuns me on suspicion.'\nAl-Hatimi said: Ali bin Jabala did well, despite his later time, in describing a horse where he says:\n'Agitated, shaking from his sides... like water in which wind roamed so it agitated.\nIf we think of him, he confirms us... and if the wild ass thinks escaping him, he lies.'\nRepetition in the poems of the moderns is abundant, but we did not direct attention to it, so in the example we brought is sufficiency. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Correspondence (Muqabala)**\nAli bin al-Husayn al-Qurashi said: I asked Ja'far bin Qudama the Scribe, who was one of the critics of poetry, about Muqabala. He said: I asked my father about it, and he said: It is that the poet posits meanings intending agreement between some of them, or disagreement, so he brings in the agreeing what agrees with it, and in the disagreeing what disagrees with it correctly, or stipulates conditions and enumerates states in one of the two meanings, so he must bring in what agrees with it the like of what he stipulated, and in what disagrees with it the opposites of that. He said: I said to him: Recite to me the best of what was said in it. He said: I do not know better than the saying of the first:\n'O wonder, how we agreed! So an advisor... loyal, and one folded on rancor, treacherous.'\nSo he placed opposite 'advisor' 'folded on rancor', and opposite 'loyal' 'treacherous'. He said: And the saying of Al-Tirimmah bin Hakim al-Ta'i in that is also good, which is:\n'We captured them and bestowed favor upon them... and we gave the dust their blood to drink.\nSo they did not have patience for might in war... nor did they perform reward for a good hand.'\nHe says: When we gave the dust their blood to drink, they had no patience for what befell them from us due to their failure and weakness of souls, and when we bestowed favor upon them and treated them well, they did not reward with praise for us. So he placed opposite their giving the dust their blood to drink and fighting them, that they be patient, and opposite their bestowing favor upon them, that they praise. He said this is Muqabala. Ali bin Harun said: Yahya bin Ali claimed that the best of what was said in Muqabala is the saying of Al-Nabigha:\n'A youth in whom was completed what pleases his friend... despite that in him is what displeases the enemy.'\nSo he placed opposite pleasure offense, and opposite friend enemy. This is a sufficient draught in this chapter. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Exception (Istithna')**",

    "text": "A group expressed it, and the closest of their sayings to the heart was what Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz mentioned, for he said: Exception in poetry is confirming praise with what resembles blame. From that is the saying of Al-Nabigha:\n'And there is no fault in them except that their swords... have notches in them from striking battalions.'\nAs for the grammarians, Exception in speech according to them is extracting a part from a whole in a comprehensive ruling meaning 'except'. He also said:\n'A youth whose morals are perfect except that he... is generous so he leaves nothing remaining of money.'\nHe also said:\n'A youth in whom was completed what pleases his friend... despite that in him is what displeases the enemies.'\nHis saying in the first verse 'except that he' and in the second 'despite that in him' is of the most brilliant and best Exception. They said: The best of what was narrated in this type is the saying of Al-Rabi' bin Dabba:\n'I perished but my talk and speech do not perish... and every man except his talks is perishing.'\nSome said: Rather the saying of the other:\n'So do not be distant except from evil, for I... towards you, even if the abode is far with me, am yearning.'\nOthers said: Rather the saying of some Bedouin:\n'Clumsy (Kharqa') except that she is skillful (Sana').'\nAbu Hiffan al-Mihzami al-Abdi excelled and did well in this chapter where he says:\n'If you ask about us, then we are the ornaments of highness... Banu Amir, and the earth of highlands.\nAnd there is no fault in us except that our generosity... harmed us, and might is from every side.\nSo death annihilated our lives, not unjust... and generosity annihilated our wealth, not faulting.\nOur father is a father, if all people had... a father like him, he would have sufficed them with virtues.'\nAmong them:\n\n**Chapter of Deepening (Ighal)**\nIt is called Delivery (Tabligh). It is when the poet brings the meaning in the verse complete before reaching his rhyme, then brings it for the need of poetry for it, because by it poetry becomes poetry, so it increases the verse in elegance, and the meaning in reaching the farthest limit. Al-Tawwazi said: I said to Al-Asma'i: Who is the most poetic of people? He said: He who comes to the base meaning and makes it great with his wording, or intends the great meaning and makes it base with his wording, or his speech ends before the rhyme, so when he needs it he brings it and provides a meaning that was not before it, as Al-A'sha said:\n'Like one butting a rock one day to split it... so he did not harm it and weakened his horn...'\nThe proverb was complete, then he needed the rhyme, so he said 'the ibex' (al-wa'il), increasing the meaning. He said: I said to him: So how did the ibex become preferred over every butter? He said: Because it descends from the peak of the mountain on its horn and it does not harm it. Dhu al-Rumma said:\n'Stop the white camels at the ruins of Mayya, let us ask... traces like the worn parts of the robe...'\nHis speech was complete, then he needed the rhyme so he said: 'the striped' (al-musalsal), increasing the meaning. Then he said:\n'I think what bestows upon you asking her is... tears like the sorting of pearls...'\nHis speech was complete, then he needed the rhyme so he said 'the separated' (al-mufassal), adding something not in the verse. The most brilliant of what was said in this chapter is the saying of Imru' al-Qais:\n'As if the eyes of the wild beasts around our domes... and our saddles are onyx which has not been pierced.'\nHe brought the simile before the rhyme, then when he brought the rhyme, he delivered it to the far extent in confirming the meaning, because the eyes of wild beasts resemble onyx, especially if they die and their forms change. Then when he brought the rhyme he said: 'Onyx which has not been pierced', so he increased the meaning in clarity; because it is more impactful in simile with unpierced onyx. He also said:\n'When he ran two heats and his flank became wet... you say the roar of the wind...'\nThe presentation and simile were complete before the rhyme. When he brought it, the rhyme increased the meaning in brilliance and purity, which is his saying: 'passed through an ath'ab tree'. That is because the ath'ab is a tree for which the wind has a intense rustling in the folds of its branches. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Metaphor (Isti'ara)**",

    "text": "Metaphor is one of the noblest and most majestic crafts of speech. The ancients used to call it 'Proverbs' (Amthal), saying: So-and-so is frequent in proverbs. Titling it 'Metaphor' is more binding because it is more general, and because not all proverbs run the course of metaphor. Do you not see the saying of Al-Sulayk bin al-Sulaka, when a man fell on him while he was sleeping and pressed Al-Sulayk, so the man farted? Al-Sulayk said: 'A fart while you are on top!' He sent it as a proverb, while stating the thing in its reality. Among the most brilliant metaphors is the saying of Dhu al-Rumma:\n'She stayed in it until the wood withered in the moist earth... and dawn drove the Pleiades in its robe.'\nAbu Amr bin al-Ala said: My hand was in the hand of Al-Farazdaq, so I recited to him the verse of Dhu al-Rumma. He said: 'Shall I recite to you or leave you?' He said: I said: 'Nay, recite to me.' He said: 'She stayed in it until the wood withered and the moist earth,' then he said: 'The wood does not wither as long as it stays in the moist earth.' Then he said: 'And I do not know a speech better than his saying: \"and dawn drove the Pleiades in its robe\", and it has no robe, but it is a metaphor.' Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: The wood does not wither as long as it is in the moist earth. Al-Suli said: I and a group of the knights of poetry gathered at Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz's, and he was an investigator in the science of Badi', whose claim was supported by the tongue of his discourse. No path of the paths of poetry remained but we walked it, and we cited the best of what was said in its meaning, until Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: What is the best metaphor of the Arabs contained in a verse of poetry? Al-Asadi said: The saying of Labid:\n'And a morning of wind and cold I removed... when its rein became in the hand of the North Wind.'\nHe assigned a hand to the North Wind and a rein to the morning. Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: This is good, and other than it is better. He took it from the saying of Tha'labah bin Su'ayr al-Mazini describing a female ostrich and a male ostrich:\n'So they remembered a piled weight after... the sun (Dhuka') threw its right hand into a coverer (Kafir).'\nThe weight: Ostrich eggs. Piled: stacked one upon another. Dhuka': The sun. Kafir: The night. He assigned a right hand to the sun thrown into the night. He said: And the saying of Dhu al-Rumma is more wondrous to me than it, even if his time was later, where he says:\n'Did Mayy visit a lovesick one with her memory... while the hands of the Pleiades were leaning in the setting places?'\nSome of us said: Labid's saying is better:\n'And I protected the tribe, my weapons carried by... a swift horse, my sash when I went early was its bridle.'\nIt is said: A horse is Furut (swift) if it precedes the horses. Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: This is good. But look at the saying of Al-Hudhali:\n'And if I entrusted him to the sun, deaths would ascend... to him, its eye and its messenger.'\nThen he said: This is marvelous. And more marvelous than it in borrowing the word of entrusting is the saying of Al-Husayn bin al-Humam al-Murri where he says:\n'We chase them, entrusting our white swords to their heads... and they entrust to us the straightened Samhari spears.'\nIn this verse is a subtle meaning indicating their advance and the retreat of their opponents, so know it from its wording. Some of us said: Dhu al-Rumma's saying is better:\n'She stayed in it until the wood withered in the moist earth... and dawn drove the Pleiades in its robe.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said: This is the ultimate, and Dhu al-Rumma is the most creative of people in metaphor. Al-Suli said: It was as if, by Allah, he alerted me to Dhu al-Rumma, so I said: Rather his saying is better:\n'And when I saw the night, while the sun was alive... the life of one spending the last breath of a dying man.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz said: You struck your fire-stick and it ignited, O Abu Bakr. This is very brilliant. But Jarir preceded him to this metaphor and did well by his saying:\n'The winds revive its quarter so they renew it... after decay, and the rains kill it.'\nHe said: This is a good verse that combined metaphor and antithesis, because he brought in it reviving and killing, and decay and newness. But Dhu al-Rumma took over the mention of reviving and killing in another place and did well by his saying:\n'And intoxicated from long drowsiness as if he... by two ropes in a knot is swinging.\nIf he dies on the saddle, I revived his spirit... by your memory, while the white camels, the messengers, are leaning.'\nAl-Suli said: We left, and there was none of the group but was overwhelmed by the sea of Ibn al-Mu'tazz in the science of poetry and his good handling of speech. I say: The first to use metaphor in poetry was Imru' al-Qais. Among his metaphors is his saying:",

    "text": "'And a night like the wave of the sea letting down its curtains... upon me with types of worries to test [me].\nSo I said to it when it stretched its spine... and followed with buttocks and rose with a chest.'\nZuhair said:\n'The heart sobered from Salma and its falsehood shortened... and the horses of youth and its mounts were stripped.'\nAl-Asma'i said: The first to strip the horses of youth was Tufayl by his saying:\n'So I became scolding its people for ignorance... and the horses of youth and its mounts were stripped.'\nAl-Udayl bin al-Farkh said:\n'The white swords are a refuge for us... when they flew with hands like the flash of lightning clouds.'\nHe also said:\n'Who is the mighty stabber, while the horses are amidst... dust whose soaking is gifted by the hooves.'\nThe metaphor is 'gifted' (tahada), and the indicator is 'by the hooves'. Muzahim al-Uqayli said:\n'I imprisoned passion in the chest until appeared... the daughters of passion wailing from every wailer.'\nHe made his chest a prison for passion, and made daughters for passion—meaning his worries—and made them appearing, and made them wailing. This is of the good metaphors. Al-Khansa' said:\n'At a predicament whose interval was narrow... death drags its tails.'\nShe assigned tails to death and made them dragged, and the indicator is verbal. Muzahim al-Uqayli said describing a desert:\n'The violent winds die in its sides... and far from its diameters is every watering place.'\nJarir said:\n'And I saw the mount of youth had fallen short... after the quick pace and tired of traveling.'\nHe also said:\n'The morning we slit with swords fetuses... of war in a pregnant one not yet due.'\n'Ibtaqarna' (we slit) is the form ifta'alna from Baqr, which is slitting the belly of a pregnant woman or other. He borrowed a belly for war and obligated slitting upon it, and extracting its fetus. Tatriq is when the exit of the child is difficult. This is a good metaphor for war. Al-A'idhi said:\n'We are the sons of war, it fed us with its breast... and its temples and horns have turned gray.'\nHajib bin Zurara said:\n'And the likes of me, if his noble striving is not rewarded... his favors speak with her mouth and pronounce.'\nFrom this verse Nusayb took his saying:\n'So they turned and praised with what you are worthy of... and if they were silent, the bags would have praised you.'\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'And gray hair rises in youth as if it is... night whose sides shout day.'\nIbn Harma took it and said:\n'And the day shouted in the night as if it were... contrary to the darkness, the flanks of a piebald horse with a blaze.'\nIbn Muqbil said:\n'From early morning until they pulled at evening... and half the sun had died, and the half was critically ill.'\nSulayman bin Ammar al-Sulami said:\n'And a master like abdominal disease, not leaving... his snakes and scorpions creep to us.'\nHe established the biting words of his speech in the place of snakes and scorpions. This is a good metaphor whose indicator is verbal, which is his saying: 'creep'. Jahsh bin Zaid al-Hanafi said:\n'We weaned Banu Ka'b from war after it... and they met from the heroes a clumsy impact.'\nThe indicator in this verse is semantic. That is because comparing war to a she-camel with various attributes has settled with them, and that they mention its teats and that it flows milk and is milked. When it settled with them and became frequent among them, discarding it and bringing it became one to them. This is a subtle meaning, so know it. Ajlan bin La'i al-Tha'labi said:\n'I wondered at the caller of war while war is raising its tail (shamidh)... pregnant, in our hands it is untied and saddled.'\nAl-Shamidh: The she-camel 'shamidhat tashmidhu' with Kasrah 'shimadhan' if she is impregnated and raises her tail. Sabir bin Safwan al-Hudhali al-Hanafi said:\n'And the sun ignited its fires and the Ghadwar of the desert... warmed itself with it until it flamed.'\nAl-Muhriz bin al-Muka'bir al-Dabbi said:\n'The reefs of glory flowed upon him when he called... his companions with faces like dinars.'\nThis is a good metaphor whose indicator is verbal, which is his saying: 'The reefs of glory flowed upon him', mentioning the flow (sayl) with the reefs (shi'ab). If he said: 'Glory flowed upon him', it would not be good. A man from Bal'anbar said:",

    "text": "'A people, if evil showed its molars to them... they flew to it in groups and individuals.'\nAl-Asma'i recited:\n'I ceased not bribing Time with patience over that which... displeases until Time pleased me with you.'\nHe made patience a bribe to Time to help him, which is a good metaphor. Qurt bin Haritha al-Amiri al-Kalbi said:\n'Indeed, only the mutual support of sorrows... grayed the forelock of me and saddened me.'\nThe metaphor is in 'mutual support' (tanasur). Abu Dahbal al-Jumahi said:\n'I say while the riders, their turbans have tilted... and night-talk has given the people the cup of intoxication to drink.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'Slumber gave him the cup of drowsiness to drink, so his head... to the religion of slumber at the end of the night is prostrating.'\nHamza bin Bayd al-Hanafi said:\n'And gray hair resided in my head, so frightened me... a guest, by your father's life, not departing.\nAnd he bent my spear then strung his bow... and shot with his arrows, so he pierced my legs.'\nAl-Afwah al-Awdi said:\n'Indeed the blessing of a people is enjoyment... and the life of a man is a borrowed robe.'\nHe made life a robe and made it borrowed. Ibn Mayyada describing glances:\n'And they sharpened, when they wanted our struggle... arrows without feathers and without shafts.'\nWhen 'arrows' settled for 'glance', he borrowed struggle and feathers, and the indicator here is verbal. Another said:\n'We took the ends of conversations between us... and the valleys flowed with the necks of the mounts.'\nUmar bin Abi Rabi'ah al-Makhzumi said:\n'And she is hidden, confused from her... in the skin of the two cheeks is the water of youth.'\nTha'lab recited:\n'When the askers came to him, the lamps of... cheerfulness and joy ignited upon him.'\nMihjan bin Utarid al-Anbari said:\n'You tell me that calamity has come... and that the years of drought, their owl has shouted.'\nThis is a good metaphor. Metaphors in verse and prose exceed the limit of every confined limit; in what we brought is sufficiency. From the Titles previously mentioned:\n\n**Chapter of Simile (Tashbih)**\nAbu Amr bin al-Ala said: And Al-Asma'i said: The best simile is what has two similes in two similes, like the saying of Imru' al-Qais:\n'As if the hearts of birds, wet and dry... at her nest are jujube and worn-out bad dates.'\nHe only singled out the hearts of birds because they are the best part. It was said: The bird of prey, when it hunts a bird, brings its heart to its chicks as food without the rest of its meat. So there remains in its nest of bird hearts fresh and old due to the abundance of its hunting, as Abu Zubayd al-Ta'i said:\n'Remaining overnight at his place from preys... are broken remains or fresh shredded meat.'\nRufat is old, and Gharid is fresh. Al-Asma'i said: The bird of prey brings the game to its nest, eats its meat and leaves its heart, so wet and dry bird hearts never cease to be in its nest. For this reason he singled out bird hearts over others. Bashar bin Burd said: I have not ceased, since I heard the verse of Imru' al-Qais, trying to approximate two similes with two similes but I cannot, until I said:\n'As if the raising of dust above their heads... and our swords, is a night whose stars are falling.'\nBashar took it from the saying of Kulthum al-Attabi:\n'Their hooves build above their heads... a roof whose stars are the cutting white [swords].'\nAl-Asma'i narrated, saying: Al-Rashid summoned me one day, and his messengers startled me. I did not delay standing in his presence. In the assembly were Yahya bin Khalid, Ja'far, and Al-Fadl. He brought me near, so I approached, and the fear that befell me became clear. He said: 'Let your panic subside, we only wanted you for what the likes of you are wanted for.' I stayed until my soul returned to me. Then he put me at ease and said: 'I disputed with these'—and he pointed to Yahya, Ja'far, and Al-Fadl—'regarding the most poetic verse the Arabs said in simile. Our consensus did not fall on a verse to be pointed to over others. So we wanted you to decide this case and harvest the fruit of the bet.' I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, designating a single verse in a single type in which poets have expanded and set up as a landmark for their thoughts and a pasture for their minds is far from being textually fixed. However, the best of poets in simile is Imru' al-Qais.' He said: 'In what?' I said: 'In his saying:",

He has stated that Imru' al-Qais is the most brilliant of people in simile.' He said: Yahya said: 'It is yours, O Commander of the Faithful.' Then Al-Rashid said: 'What are his most brilliant similes to you?' I said: 'His saying describing a horse:\n\"As if his looking up in the forenoon... is the looking up of a blue [eyed eagle] with claws.\nIf his housings are stripped from him... you say stripped [of flesh], but he is not stripped.\"' \nAl-Rashid said: 'This is good, and better than it is his saying:\n\"So we went with him like the water bird, being led in our midst... the eye descends in him at times and ascends.\"' \nJa'far said: 'It is arbitration, O Commander of the Faithful.' He said: 'How?' He said: 'Let the Commander of the Faithful mention what his choice fell upon, and we mention what we chose, and the judgment will occur afterwards.' Al-Rashid said: 'You have hit the mark (Aghradta).' Al-Asma'i said: I appreciated it from him. It is said: 'Aghrada al-rajul' if he neared correctness. Then Al-Rashid said: 'Let Yahya begin.' Yahya said: 'The best of people in simile is Al-Nabigha in his saying:\n\"She looked at you with a need she did not fulfill... the look of the sick to the faces of the visitors.\"\nAnd his saying:\n\"For you are like the night that overtakes me... even if I thought the distance from you is wide.\"\nAnd his saying:\n\"From the wild of Wajra, marked on her shanks... folding the gut like the sword of the solitary polisher.\"'\nAl-Asma'i said: I said: 'As for the simile of the sickness of the eye, it is good, except that he spoiled it by mentioning illness and likening the woman to a sick person. Better than it is the saying of Adi bin al-Riqa':\n\"Drowsy, slumber targeted him so... a sleep fluttered in his eye and he is not sleeping.\"\nAs for likening attainment to the night and day in what they attain, the way was for him to bring what has no counterpart so he brings a unique meaning. If a sayer wished to say that the saying of Al-Namari in this meaning is better, he would find justification, which is:\n\"Even if I were in Al-Anqa' or its summits... I would think you, unless you turn away, see me.\"\nAs for his saying: \"Like the sword of the solitary polisher\", Al-Tirimmah is more deserving of this meaning than him, because he took it, improved it, and added to it, even if Al-Nabigha initiated it. Al-Tirimmah said:\n\"It appears and the lands hide it as if it is... a sword on a high place being drawn and sheathed.\"\nHe combined in this verse a subtle metaphor in his saying \"hide it\", and likened two things to two things in his saying \"appears and hides\" and \"drawn and sheathed\", which is a good antithesis, and contains good explanation and correct correspondence.'\nAl-Asma'i said: Al-Rashid rejoiced until the lines of his face shone, so I imagined lightning flashing from them. He said to Yahya: 'I surpassed you, by the Lord of the Kaaba.' Yahya's color paled as if hot ash was sprinkled on him. Al-Fadl said: 'Do not hasten, O Commander of the Faithful, until what he said passes his hearing.' He said: 'Speak.' Al-Fadl said: 'The best of people in simile to me is Tarafa in his saying:\n\"Her breastbone splits the bubbles of water with her... just as the Mufayil divides the dust with the hand.\"\nAl-Mufayil is the one who gathers dust and divides it into two or three halves and puts a hidden object in it. Al-Fayal is the noun without Hamza. So he likened the ship splitting water with its chest to their dividing the dust. And his saying:\n\"By your life, indeed death, whatever the youth misses... is like the slackened tether whose folded end is in the hand.\"\nAnd his saying:\n\"And a face as if the sun cast its robe... upon it, pure of color, not wrinkled.\"'",

Furthermore, Tarafa is an author of one [poem]; he is not judged by the meters, but is counted among the authors of the single [masterpiece].' He said: 'And who are the authors of the single?' He said: 'Al-Harith bin Hilliza, Al-As'ar al-Ju'fi, Al-Afwah al-Awdi, Alqama al-Fahl, Suwayd bin Abi Kahil, Amr bin Kulthum, and Amr bin Ma'dikarib.' Al-Asma'i said: Generosity lightened Al-Rashid so he said: 'Come near, for you are a lone foal.' He said: So he increased in nobility in my eyes. Ja'far said, quoting a proverb: 'Wait a little, Hamal will join the battle.' Insinuating that he might catch up with what he attempts. Al-Rashid said:\n'By Allah, the forerunners missed you in the range... and you came a silent one with increased limbs, fourth.'\nHe said: I saw heat in his face. Ja'far said: 'On the condition of your clemency, O Commander of the Faithful.' He said: 'Do you think it encompasses other than you and narrows from you!?' Ja'far said: 'I do not specify a single poet as the best of people in simile in one verse, but the saying of Imru' al-Qais is among the best similes where he says:\n\"As if my boy, when he topped the state of his back... is on the back of a hawk in the sky soaring.\"\nAnd Adi bin al-Riqa' said:\n\"They exchange of dust a robe... dusty, tightly woven, they both wove it.\nIt is folded if they ascend a protruding place... and if the hooves tread smooth ground, they spread it.\"\nAnd Al-Nabigha's saying:\n\"For you are a sun and the kings are stars... when it rises, no star appears from them.\"\nFrom this meaning Nusayb took his saying:\n\"He is the full moon and people are the stars around him... and do stars resemble the luminous full moon?\"'\nAl-Asma'i said: 'This is all pure, brilliant, and others are more brilliant than it. The designation needs to fall on what its sayer invented and was not approached, or a poet approached it but fell short. As for Imru' al-Qais's saying: \"on the back of a hawk in the sky soaring\", it is from the saying of Abu Du'ad:\n\"If its rider wished, he hugged him... as a hawk hugs the wing to itself.\"\nAs for Adi's saying: \"They exchange of dust a robe\", it is from Al-Khansa's saying:\n\"He raced his father, so they approached while they... exchanged the robe of the run.\"\nThe first to speak this meaning was a Jahili poet from Banu Uqayl, saying from verses:\n\"Desolate deserts where the sandgrouse become bewildered... and two wild asses become morning in them battling.\nRaising from the weave of dust upon them... two shirts, worn out, which they wear.\"\nAs for Al-Nabigha's saying: \"For you are a sun\" etc., an ancient poet from Kinda praising Amr bin Hind preceded him in it, and he is more entitled to it than Al-Nabigha as he was its deflowerer (originator):\n\"The earth almost sways with people if they see... for Amr bin Hind anger while he is blaming.\nHe is the sun, surpassed on a day of fortune, so he excelled... in light, and the kings are stars.\"' \nHe said: By Allah, it was as if I fed Ja'far a stone. Al-Rashid shook on his throne with joy, almost flying from wonder and delight, and said: 'O Asma'i, hear what my choice fell upon now.' I said: 'Let the Commander of the Faithful speak, may Allah grant him success.' He said: 'I have designated three poems; I swear by Allah I possess the winning cane with one of them. Do you know, O Asma'i, a grander and greater simile in a most contemptible and small simulated object in a better exhibition than the saying of Antara:\n\"And the fly was alone with it, so it is not leaving... singing like the act of the drinker humming.\nSinging, sharpening his arm with his arm... the strike of the one bending over the fire-stick, the mutilated.\"\nThen he said: 'O Asma'i, this is of the sterile (unique) similes.' I said: 'It is so, O Commander of the Faithful, and by your glory I swore I never heard anyone describe in poetry a thing better than this description, nor was able to reach this limit.' He said: 'Gently, do not hasten. Do you know better than the saying of Al-Hutay'ah describing the foam of his she-camel, or do you know anyone before him or after him who likened his likeness where he says:\n\"You see between her jaws when she murmurs... foam like the stretched spider's web.\"' \nHe said: I said: 'I did not know anyone preceded him or indicated this meaning after him.' He said: 'Do you know more brilliant and effective than Al-Shammakh's simile of an ostrich whose feathers fell and its trace remained in his saying:",

    "text": "\"As if the bending of the stems of what she stripped... of the fluff with her two sides are warts.\"' \nI said: 'No, by Allah.' He turned to Yahya and said: 'Is it obligatory?' He said: 'It is obligatory.' He said: 'Shall I increase you?' He said: 'And what good has the Commander of the Faithful not increased me from?' He said: 'The saying of Al-Nabigha al-Ja'di:\n\"He shot the udder of an old camel, so she poured with a stab... like the border of the Yemeni striped robe.\"' \nThen he turned to Al-Fadl and said: 'Is it obligatory?' He said: 'It is obligatory.' He said: 'Shall I increase you?' He said: 'That is up to the Commander of the Faithful.' He said: 'The saying of the Bedouin:\n\"In it the striking of the scars of the old she-camels is as if... playgrounds of children lining and sharpening.\"' \nThen he turned to Ja'far and said: 'Is it obligatory?' He said: 'It is obligatory.' He said: 'Shall I increase you?' He said: 'To the Commander of the Faithful belongs the high opinion.' He said: 'The saying of Adi bin al-Riqa':\n\"She drives a nasal-voiced one, as if the needle of his horn... is a pen that hit from the inkwell its ink.\"' \nHe said: Then Al-Rashid looked down, raised his glance and said: 'O Asma'i, do you think you cheat me of my mind by your lowering yourself in my desire?' I said: 'No, by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, indeed you are too majestic for instigation.' He said: 'Look well.' I said: 'I have looked.' He said: 'So the precedence belongs to whom?' I said: 'To the Commander of the Faithful.' He said: 'I have allotted you a tenth of it, and a tenth is much.' Then he threw his glance to Yahya and said: 'The money,' threateningly and menacingly. It was but yes and no until the purses were stacked before him so they almost stood between me and him. I saw the light of dawn had overcome the light of the candle. He signaled to a servant at his head, so he gave me from the money, which was three million dirhams, thirty purses. I left with it to the house, and he rose from his assembly. It was the happiest night with which a morning smiled upon accomplished wealth. Bashar said: When I composed my saying 'As if the raising of dust' etc., and its mention has preceded, I returned and presented the meaning in closer wording, saying:\n'Of every famous one in the hand of a famous one... as if his blaze and the sword are two stars.'\nI likened the blaze of the man and the sword to two stars. Muslim bin al-Walid followed him and said:\n'In a dark cloud the open land shines with it... like the night whose stars are the swords and spears.'\nMansur al-Namari took it and said:\n'A night of dust, no sun and no moon... except your forehead and the sharp pointed spears.'\nA man from Banu Asad says:\n'Accidents shaved my locks so they left me... a head ringing as if it is a Jummah.\nAnd the fire of gray hair grew in my temples and the horn of my forelock... as the lamp grew.'\nJummah: plural Jamamih, is a yellow arrow with no arrowhead, having clay at its head like a lump children play with. Close to this simile is the saying of another, and he has a story:\n'I went with a head like the small rock, overlooked... by an eagle, then its eagle flew.\nAnd a bull went with it, shining as if it is... chains of lightning, its downpour and pouring.'\nAbu Zaid recited:\n'As if the casting of a rein at her knee... on the ground is a snake not slithering.'\nAbu Du'ad al-Iyadi said:\n'Struggling with the fold of a Hadrami [rope] as if it is... the bubble of a sand dune followed by a grazing [animal] throwing.'\nAl-Nabigha al-Dhubyani said:\n'Thrown with the flesh of the meat, its protruding tooth... has a creaking, the creaking of the bucket pulley with the rope.'\nThe people of Badi' call this the Stripped Simile. If they liken what has motion and sound, they use Nasb (accusative) as they said: 'Sarifan Sarifa' (creaking the creaking of), in accusative. If it is not so, they use Raf' (nominative) as the sayer says: 'Lahu ra'sun ra'su al-asad' (He has a head [like] the head of a lion), in nominative. From it is simile by action, which is their saying: 'He does the deed of the noble', and 'He is forbearing the forbearance of Al-Ahnaf'. The meaning: He does a deed like the deed of the noble, and is forbearing a forbearance like the forbearance of Al-Ahnaf. From it is His Almighty's saying: \"And you see the mountains, thinking them rigid, while they pass as the passing of clouds.\" Antara said in similes of banners:\n'Battalions driven, above every battalion... a banner like the shadow of the bird turning.'\nAnd he has in similes of the killed:\n'As if they are by the side of the ravine, fallen... having given each other the cup of wine to drink.'\nAnd he has in similes of tears:\n'Is it from the weeping of a dove in a thicket... your tears overflowed over the back of the camel litter?\nLike pearls or the arrangement of beads, cut... from it the knots of its string, not connected.'",

    "text": "Abu Nadlah Yamut bin al-Muzarri' said:\n'And the full moon leans to setting as if... it drew over the water a gilded sword.'\nAnd he has:\n'I did not forget the Tigris while the darkness is cut... and the full moon in the horizon of the sky is setting.\nSo as if it [Tigris] in it is a blue robe... and as if it [moon] in it is a gilded embroidery.'\nAbu Muhallim said describing the sun:\n'Hidden; as for when the night covers it... it hides, and as for in the day, it appears.'\nAl-Kindi said describing the Pleiades:\n'When the Pleiades in the sky exposed themselves... the exposure of the folds of the preferred sash.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'I arrived by night journey while the Pleiades were as if... on the crown of the head a water bird circling.'\nQais bin al-Aslat said, and did well:\n'And the Pleiades appeared in the morning to whoever saw... like a cluster of white grapes when it blossoms.'\nYazid Ibn al-Tathriya said:\n'When the Pleiades in the sky were as if... pearls whose string weakened so they scattered.'\nSome of them said:\n'So seize drinking it, for the moon has exposed the night... as if it is the span of a fire-stick.\nAnd the Pleiades are fluttering in the canopy of the... West, falling as if they are the head of a leopard.'\nAl-Himyari said regarding the slain of Ali, peace be upon him:\n'You see the birds like women around him... going early to a sick man as visitors.'\nA Bedouin said describing armor:\n'Upon them like pools, doubled... of Mazi [armor], not burdening the backs.'\nAbu Du'ad al-Iyadi said:\n'And I prepared for war a flowing [coat of mail]... dwindling in folding, like the file.'\nKa'b bin Sa'd al-Ghanawi said:\n'And a people dragging their robes as if they are... drunk, while you alerted them for departure.'\nHe describes them with drowsiness. Zuhair said in likening the traces of dwellings to tattoos on palms and wrists:\n'And a house for her at Al-Raqmatayn as if... references of tattoo on the sinews of a wrist.'\nAntara said likening the jaw of a crow:\n'Clumsy of wing, as if the two jaws of his head... are shears for news, fragile, fond.'\nAl-Ra'i said describing a hunter with curly head hair:\n'So as if the peak of his head from his hair... was planted, so its two sides grew pepper.'\nDhu al-Rumma said:\n'And a night like the bride's jilbab I wore... with four [camels], while the figure in the eye is one.'\nMudarris bin Rib'i said describing an ostrich:\n'Small-headed, bare of neck veins, her head... like the mallet and her nose like the awl.'\nAl-Nabigha said describing vultures:\n'You see them behind the people, looking askance, their eyes... the sitting of old men in the skins of hares.'\nThe sister of Amr Dhi al-Kalb said and did well:\n'The vultures walk to him while she is playful... the walk of virgins upon whom are jilbabs.'\nDhu al-Rumma said likening sand to the hips of virgins:\n'And sand like the hips of virgins I crossed... when the dark black nights wore it.'\nAl-Sayyid al-Himyari innovated and did well in describing the Commander of the Faithful Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, and likening him to the wind of Ad, and was not preceded to that:\n'But Abu Hasan, and Allah supported him... was at the encounter accustomed to stabbing.\nIf he saw a warring assembly, he put them to sleep... the sleep of the Wind in its homes, 'Ad.'\nAl-Kindi said:\n'I gathered a Rudayni spear as if its spearhead... is the light of a flame not connected to smoke.'\nAl-Hamid recited:\n'As if what falls from her foam... is the house of spiders upon her rein.'\nThis is like the verse of Al-Hutay'ah previously mentioned. The meaning is that he likened the foam to the spider's web due to their sharing in thinness and distance from density. It is said: 'Ankabut' and 'Akanbah', as they said: 'Uqab' and 'Uqanbah', and it is said: 'Ankaba'. In this is an explanation whose exposition is long and this is not its place. Mu'aqqir al-Bariqi said in his simile of armies:\n'And he gathered a gathering as if its number... is locusts blown in dust flying.'\nHe also said:",

    "text": "So battalions came to them early at sunrise... like the corners of Salma, their march successive.\nAl-Hakami said describing a ship:\nSo it was as if, while the water struck its chest... and the bamboo pole was in the sailor's hand.\n[Like] a black one of the eagles rushing to the darkness... descending with a sound and flapping of wing.\nThis chapter is vast in scope, far from ending, like the sea whose waves cannot be counted, nor its path exhausted. In what we have presented is more than enough. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Sound Padding in Useful Meaning (Al-Hashw Al-Sadid fi Al-Ma'na Al-Mufid)**\nAbu al-Shis al-Khuza'i said:\nIndeed the eighty [years], *and may you reach them*, ... have made my hearing in need of a translator.\nHis saying: *and may you reach them*, is sound padding, and it has benefited as a supplication with a good meaning.\nAl-Yazidi recited:\nSo who is for me regarding the eye with which you were once... towards me, *my soul be your ransom*, looking.\nHis saying: *my soul be your ransom*, is like his saying: *and may you reach them*, in supplication.\nAbu al-Walid Abdul Malik bin Abdul Rahman al-Harithi said:\nIf what is with me were with you, *may it not be with you*, then... kindness towards me and closeness would have come to you early and late.\nHis saying: *may it not be with you* is good padding.\nAbu Amr bin al-Ala recited from the Jahili era:\nAnd an old camel, *little of guilt*, I returned to beating him... when longing from her familiar places stirred a memory.\nAnd I said to him: Dhalfa', woe to you, caused... the beating for you, so be patient, *for your habit is patience*.\nIbn al-Mu'tazz took this meaning and said:\nAnd horses that leading has folded until they seem like... brown tubes of al-Khatt spears, withered.\nWe poured upon them, *being unjust*, our whips... so quick hands and legs flew with them.\nHis saying: *being unjust* is like his saying: *little of guilt*. This is the sound padding, in useful wording.\nAs for when the padding is like the saying of Abu al-Iyal al-Hudhali:\nI remembered my brother so there returned to me... headache of *the head* and pain.\nHeadache is only in the head, so mentioning *the head* is unsound padding. Similar is the saying of Dik al-Jinn:\nSo it breathed in the house when mixed... with water and unsheathed the light of flame.\nLike the breathing of basil mixed with... fresh branches from the roses of Jur.\nSo his mentioning *mixing* suffices, and his mentioning *water* is an addition not needed. He fell short of Abu Nuwas's saying:\nPull the mask of clay from a remnant... alive with life, overlooking death.\nSo it breathed in the house when mixed... like the breathing of basil *in the nose*.\nThis example in this chapter is sufficient. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Following (Al-Mutaba'a)**\nFollowing in prose speech and organized poetry is that the speaker brings meanings that cannot be advanced one over the other, because the meanings in them are sequential. So the first is followed by the second, and the second is followed by the third, until the speaker reaches the end of his intent. It is not permissible to advance the second over the first, nor the third over the second. An example of that is His Almighty's saying: (It is He who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clot, then He brings you out as a child, then let you reach your maturity, then let you become old men). And He, Blessed and Exalted, said: (Then he called her from below her, \"Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream. And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates. So eat and drink and be contented.\") This is of the best craft of speech in this chapter, so glory be to the Speaker of it and Exalted greatly.\nAl-Asma'i recited:\nBut she is a friendship whose blood was mixed with... tragedy, passion, breaking promises, and changing.\nFaj' (tragedy) here is treachery, and Wal' (passion/lying) is lying. And their saying: The world, its tragedies (faja'i'uha) are not safe from, meaning its treacheries. The aspect of following is that if treachery occurs, lying becomes evident, and if changing occurs, difference appears.\nZuhair said:\nIt is delayed, so placed in a book, so stored... for a Day of Reckoning, or hastened so avenged.\nAl-Shanfara said:\nWith my eyes when she entered evening, so spent the night, so entered morning... so she decreed matters, so she rose, so she turned away.\nArta'ah bin Suhayya said:\nYou ate blood and we drank blood... so we were not quenched from it nor were you satiated.\nIbn Sulayman al-Kilabi said:",

    "text": "So there ceased not to be from them a defender and a stabber... in a state, or a striker and a stabber.\nA'sha of Ukl said:\nWe stopped at it until the intensity of the forenoon passed... fulfilling needs and weeping for youthful passion.\nAnd we gift greetings and show affection... and hide of the passion that is not hidden.\nAs for the first verse, there is no witness in it, but we established it for the clarity of the second verse, and advancing and delaying is permissible in it. As for the second verse, the aspect of following in it is that greetings are what is begun with, then affection appears and some of it is hidden, even if it is not hidden as he mentioned.\nZiyad al-A'jam said:\nO family of Lukayz, a call of one not regretful... Did an Anazi insult me, then was not slapped?\nNor was his nose cut, nor was he dyed with blood?\nAmr bin al-Harith said:\nSo he may visit my pot and I ladle its meat... so I become my boon companion so I earn my praise.\nVisiting happens first, then ladling, then giving drink, and after that praise is earned.\nAl-Jawn al-Namari said:\nWho will convey to Shayban that... I, my affair was not hidden.\nI shot him until when... our arrows were exhausted.\nI stabbed him until when... our spears were splinters.\nI struck him until when... our swords were bent.\nI wounded him by overcoming, and he was... defended of old, refusing.\nI gave him my saddle and my... mount and a Himyari saddle.\nDid you see if a snake bit... your brother in the land, vomiting?\nOr the sickness of death attained him... then what is upon me and what is with me?\nThese verses have a story whose explanation is long, and we only mention a little of it: That is when it was the Day of Uwarah, Al-Jawn al-Namari captured Haritha bin Amr bin Abi Rabi'ah bin Dhuhl bin Shayban. King Al-Mundhir overcame Al-Jawn, took Haritha from him and killed him. Banu Shayban claimed that Al-Jawn killed him. So he said this poetry describing his state with him. He began by mentioning shooting which is the beginning of war, and followed with mentioning stabbing, then mentioning striking, then victory belongs to one of the two parties; so either favor or killing. When he completed that, he followed it with reproach like one apologizing to them. In this example is sufficiency. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of the Pleasant Transition (Makhlas) to Satire and Praise**\nAli bin al-Munajjim said: I asked my father, who was one of the knights of knowledge of poetry, about the best transition a poet used to transition to praise or satire. He said: O my son, this is a path in which the moderns (Muwalladun) were unique; rarely did excellence in it happen for an ancient. As for what I found our people agreeing upon of that, it is the saying of Muhammad bin Wuhayb:\nHe ceased not letting me kiss his lips... and the pitcher and the cup gave me a second drink.\nUntil the night reclaimed its robe... and a brightness appeared through its blackness.\nAnd the morning appeared as if its blaze... is the face of the Caliph when he is praised.\nHe only looked from this meaning to the saying of the Bedouin:\nI say while the star, its left sides leaned... to setting: Contemplate a perplexed look.\nIs it a glimpse of the light of lightning my sight saw... or the face of Nu'm appeared to me or the light of a fire?\nNay, the face of Nu'm appeared while the night was dark... so it loomed from between screens and curtains.\nHassan said in satire:\nIf you were lying about what you told me... then may you escape the escape of Al-Harith bin Hisham.\nHe left the loved ones to fight without them... and escaped with the head of a swift mare and a bridle.\nThe moderns have many beautiful poems in this chapter; we have no need to prolong by mentioning them. In what we have cited is sufficiency, and Allah is the Grantor of success to what is right. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Inclusion (Tadmin)**\nIt is called Tasmits and Tawshih. This is very rare in the poetry of the Arabs. The moderns have used of it what cannot be counted in abundance and number, and a little of it is evidence of much. Al-Akhtal said:\nAnd he rose to the Khurrami but did not say... after fatigue: But my advance narrowed.\nHe included the saying of Antara:\nWhen they shield themselves with me from the spearheads I did not recoil... from them: But my advance narrowed.\nAnother said from verses:",

    "text": "When I weep for bankruptcy, misery, and poverty... they say: *Do not perish of sorrow and show beauty.*\nIndeed my repetition and my confinement upon you has prolonged... *so is there any reliance at an effaced trace?*\nI wore out at the Prince's door as if I were... *Stop, let us weep from the memory of a beloved and a dwelling.*\nAnother said:\nHer Amr said to me when she flirted with me... *Do not stop at the effaced ruins.*\nAmong them:\n\n**Chapter of Feigned Ignorance (Tajahul al-Ta'aruf)**\nThe meaning of feigned ignorance is that the poet or prose writer asks about something he knows, the question of one who does not know it, so that it is known that the intensity of resemblance to the likened object has caused that in him. It is frequent in the poems and speeches of the Arabs. Dhu al-Rumma said:\nI say to a dark-lipped, long-necked one who ran... for us between the top of 'Urfa and the cutting sands.\nO gazelle of the soft sand between Julajul... and the sand dune, *are you or Umm Salim?*\nIbn Duraid recited for some of them:\nIs it from the full moon at evening... that those curtains were lifted?\nOr from the sun was unveiled... at midnight that veil?\nOr upon the neck of a gazelle... were those earrings hung?\nOr did time show you what... the standing people did not see?\nAs for His Almighty's saying: (And what is that in your right hand, O Moses? He said: It is my staff). The intent of this question, with knowledge of it, is to manifest the miracle which Moses did not know was in the staff. The people of the craft called it the Question of Confirmation. Likewise His Almighty's saying: (And when Allah said, \"O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?'\"). Allah Almighty knew that he did not say that. The intent of it is rebuking whoever claimed that and belying whoever said it. So it is a question of a confirmer, not a question of an inquirer, so know it. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Mumatana (Poetic Contest), Infaq (Exhaustion), and Ijazah (Completion)**\nAs for Mumatana, it is two poets disputing a verse between them; one says its beginning (Sadr) and the other its end (Ajuz).\nAs for Infad and Ijazah: Infad, with un-dotted Dal, is from their saying: A disputant is Munafid if he argues until he exhausts his proof. And you say: Nafadtu al-rajul (I exhausted the man), like I judged him. In the Hadith: \"If you exhaust them, they will exhaust you.\" It is that a poet says a complete verse and the other says a verse.\nAs for Mumatana, it is narrated that a boy from Banu Janb called Rifa'a, and it is said: he is Al-Muhtarish, excelled in poetry and contested the poets of his people until he overcame them. When he became confident in himself of that, he said to his father: I will surely go out among the tribes of Yemen; if I find someone who contests me, I will return to my land, and if I do not encounter someone who contests me, I will explore all the tribes of the Arabs. He stopped at a clan of Banu Nahd, and the neighborhood was empty of men (Khuluf). He made his camel kneel aside from the dwellings. Suddenly, an old woman, sturdy (Hayzabun), approached leaning on a crooked stick. She said: Good evening (Im Zalaman). He said: Good evening to you. She said: From whom is the man? He said: From Madhhij. She said: From which of them? He said: From Janb. She said: A guest? He said: Yes. She said: May Allah not have mercy on you, you did nothing but deem us miserly and made our story bad. Then she roused his mount and said: Rise to the dome of our guests. She did not let him possess his mount until she brought it to the dome and made it kneel, then unloaded his saddle and sheltered him in her tent. She ordered a maid of hers, who came with a knife and a young goat strutting in its skin from fatness. She said: Slaughter, O man. And she kneaded, baked, cooked, and presented food. The man, the old woman, and the maid sat eating. The old woman said to him: What threw you into this land? He informed her of his news. She laughed and said: Spend the night comfortably, tomorrow I will bring you ten virgins who will contest you instead of the men. If you are overcome, return to your land. When morning came, the old woman approached with three young women like fillies. They stepped aside. Then she pointed to one of them, and she approached like a tall palm tree swayed by the east wind. She said: Are you the challenger in Mumatana? He said: Yes. She said: Say, let me hear. He said:\nGrazing camels, their pregnant ones called out with yearning.\nShe said:\nCarriers of burdens, rising heavily so walking slowly.\nHe said:\nWhen their shepherds called out in their two sides.\nShe said:\nSeparated ones rose from them, raising tails, pregnant.\nHe said:\nIf they tread a land, they water it with their flow.\nShe said:\nCream of musk, pure, not mixed.\nHe said:",

She said:\nA shackle, by Allah's life, if I wished I could cut it...\nIs my straying, but nobility is more worthy.\nThe man said: I turned to my saddle. The old woman said: Gently, I will bring you the other. He said: The first quenched me. She said: Join your land now.\nThe man said: I went out wanting to return to my people, then stubbornness refused me except to pursue what I went out for. I was pushed to a clan of Jarm. Suddenly, little boys were playing at a pond. I went down to look at them, and behold, they were reciting Rajaz. I called a boy from the most elevated of them and said: O boy, is there anyone in this clan of yours who can contest me? For I have overcome the poets of the Arabs. He said: I will contest you. I said: You, O little one! He said: Say, and leave what does not benefit you.\nI said:\nWild beasts like the Onyx of Zafar, four.\nHe said:\nA dark-haired, speckled one protected them.\nI said:\nHe roams the meadow with them, and safety is his neighbor.\nHe said:\nAnd the drawn sword and the deposited are empty for them.\nI said: Woe to you. And I mounted my camel until I was pushed to an old man tending little sheep of his. I asked him for hospitality. He hastened to a cup and milked the remainder of what was in their udders, then brought it to me and I drank. When I was at ease, he said to me: What threw you to this region? I informed him, and hid from him what I encountered. The old man grinned then shouted at boys grazing near him. A boy from them approached. He said: Call Ashraqa. It was not long before a little girl came, lean as if she were a stick of Khaysafuj, until she stood before him. He said: Indeed your cousin here went out of his land challenging in Mumatana. Do you have anything? She said: Say, O challenger. And she was turning her eyes like the eyes of a speckled snake. I said:\nWhat is a blue drop in the shadow of a rock?\nShe said:\nA store of a white-peaked, dark-layered [cloud].\nI said:\nThe flowing of the wind denied the speck from its surface.\nShe said:\nAnd the branches of the thicket drove away the burning heat from its purity.\nI said:\nA saliva is mixed, the bees purified its honey.\nShe said:\nWith a pure reddish wine, the foam was removed from its surface.\nHe said: I left what I intended and inclined to another direction, and described a she-camel. She laughed and said: You became obscure? I said:\nWhen the chameleon flattens itself on the head of its stick.\nShe said:\nAnd the intense heat forced the mother of the lizard into its burrow.\nRifa'a said: I returned to my family and swore to myself not to contest anyone after her as long as I lived. This example in Mumatana is sufficient, and were it not for lengthiness, I would have cited wondrous witty things of this type.\nAs for Infad and Ijazah, it was narrated that Ka'b bin Zuhair, when he started composing poetry, his father Zuhair used to forbid him from it; fearing that his poetry was not yet firm, so what would be flawed would be narrated from him. He used to beat him for that. He overcame him, and that went on for long, so he took him and imprisoned him and said: By the One I swear by, you shall not speak a verse of poetry, nor shall it reach me that you desire a poem, except I will beat you a beating that will deter you from that. He remained imprisoned for days, then he was informed that he spoke it. So he beat him a severe beating, then released him and sent him out with a small flock while he was a little boy. He went and grazed it, then returned with it while reciting Rajaz:\nAs if I drive with my flock a caravan...\nFrom the villages, loaded with barley.\nZuhair went out to him angry. He called for a she-camel, rode it, reached him and let him ride behind him. Then he moved his camel wanting to test Ka'b, and know what he had, and see his poetry. He said when he separated from the tribe:\nAnd indeed a bold she-camel goes early with me upon worry...\nTrotting with a connecter, cutting off, and galloping.\nThen he hit him and said: Complete (Ajiz), O slave (Luka').

    "text": "The love of the forenoon delayed him, and he saw... the sky of a peeled-legged, long-necked [ostrich].\nZuhair said:\nShe yearns for the likes of heavy [birds], crouching...\nAt a path from her split eggs.\nThen he said: Complete, O slave. He said:\nHer eggs shattered from her, revealing beaks...\nAnd eyes like small pox that have not split.\nZuhair took Ka'b's hand and said to him: I have permitted you poetry. Among them:\n\n**Chapter of Plagiarism (Sariqa)**\nPlagiarism in poems is divided into two parts: praiseworthy and blameworthy. The stallion poets of the Arabs used to find poetry theft ugly, as Tarafa said:\n'I do not raid upon poems stealing them... I am rich without them, and the worst of people is he who steals.'\nDespite this, they have ugly thefts, and raids ignited by the fire-sticks of abundance. As for the praiseworthy plagiarism, it is of ten types:\nFirst: Fulfilling the long wording in the brief concise. Tarafa said:\n'I see the grave of a miserly hoarder of his wealth... like the grave of a strayer in idleness, spoiling.'\nIbn al-Ziba'ra abbreviated it and said:\n'And gifts are mean between us... and equal is the grave of a wealthy and a poor.'\nHe occupied the beginning of the verse with a meaning and brought Tarafa's verse in the end of a verse shorter than it with a clear meaning and distinct wording.\nSecond: Transferring the base to the solid sturdy. A Bedouin wishing for his wife's death said:\n'Indeed the death of the Amiri woman, if Time decreed it... is life for Ibn al-Wa'ili.'\nThe meaning is subtle and the wording is weak. The brother of Al-Harith bin Hilliza took it and said:\n'Do not be despising the affair of a man... perhaps from the affair are affairs.\nPerhaps eyes were cooled by a grief... burning, from which eyes had become hot.'\nThird: Transferring what is ugly in structure but not in meaning to what is beautiful in structure and meaning. Al-Hakami said:\n'The voice of wealth became hoarse from... complaining about you and shouting.'\nIts meaning is correct and its wording is ugly. Salm took it and said:\n'Wealth and enemies complained of his hand... he ceased not to be an oppressor to wealth and enemies.'\nHe combined two noble complaints, and prayed for the praised one to continue his oppression of wealth and enemies, and improved the craft in his wording and taking.\nFourth: Reversing what becomes by reversal praise after being satire.\n'Whatever you wish of wealth, a sanctuary... sheltering to a permissible honor.'\nThe sayer reversed it and said:\n'He is the man, as for his wealth it is permissible... to a seeker, and as for his honor it is forbidden.'\nFifth: Extracting a meaning from a meaning he followed, even if he differed from what was intended by it. Al-Hakami said about wine:\n'Night does not descend where she settled... so the time of her drinkers is day.'\nAl-Buhturi followed him, and differed from Al-Hakami's intent, making it about a beloved, saying:\n'Her darkness disappeared, and what night... darkens upon us while you are a full moon!?'\nSixth: Generating speech from speech whose wording is different and meaning is agreed, and it is indicative of the poet's acumen. Al-Asma'i recited for some of them:\n'A boy of war who plunged into it and perished... and a grinding millstone ground him.\nFor upon the youth is advancing in it... and not upon him is what death committed.'\nAbu Tammam took it and said:\n'For a matter, upon them is that its beginnings complete... and not upon them is that its consequences complete.'\nThe meaning is agreed and the wording is different, and this is among the best faces of thefts.\nSeventh: Generating appreciated meanings in different words. This is rare in poems, and it was among the worthiest of what the poet strained his acumen in, except that it is difficult. The poet said:\n'As if the cups of the drink while the night is dark... are the faces of virgins in black wraps.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz derived from it his saying:\n'And I see the Pleiades in the sky as if it is... a foot that appeared from mourning clothes.'\nEighth: Equality between the stolen-from and the stealer, with an addition that attached the preceded to the precedent. Al-Dik said:\n'Diluted from the hand of a gazelle as if... he took it from his cheek and circulated it.'\nIbn al-Mu'tazz took it and said:\n'As if the purest of wine is from the water of his cheek... and its cluster is picked from his curly hair.'",

    "text": "So he added a simile that is from the completeness of meaning, so they became equal; this by his precedence, and this by his addition. And its like is many.\nNinth: Similarity in speech until no system is preferred over another. Hassan bin Thabit said:\n'They are visited until their dogs do not bark... they do not ask about the approaching black figure.'\nAl-Hakami took it and said:\n'To the house of a tavern keeper whose dogs do not bark... at me, nor do they deny the length of my stay.'\nThere is no difference between the two meanings nor the two speeches, for they are similar.\nTenth: The preponderance of the taker's wording over the taken-from, and the preference of his meaning over a meaning he issued from him. Al-Nabigha said:\n'The veil (Nasif) fell and she did not want its falling... so she took it and shielded herself from us with the hand.'\nAbu Hayya al-Numayri took it and said:\n'So she cast a mask, beneath it is the sun, and shielded herself... with the best connected two: a palm and a wrist.'\nAl-Nabigha did not increase upon informing of her shielding with her hand when her veil fell. Abu Hayya increased upon him by his saying: 'beneath it is the sun', and informed about shielding with the best report, of the beauty of a palm and the beauty of a wrist. So his speech outweighed and his system rose.\n\nAs for the blameworthy of Plagiarism, it is also ten types:\nFirst: Transferring the short wording to the long abundant. Al-Hakami said:\n'Do not extend a favor to me... until I perform thanks for what has passed.'\nDi'bil took it and said:\n'I left you, I did not leave you out of ingratitude for a blessing... and is attaining increase hoped for by ingratitude?\nBut when I saw you desiring... and you exceeded in kindness to me, I was incapable of thanks.'\nThe poetry is good in meaning and wording, but he brought it in lengthening and inclusion, so he transferred the short to the long, and that is blameworthy in theft.\nSecond: Transferring the solid sturdy to the weakened base. The first said:\n'And I killed you with satire but you did not die... indeed dogs are long of lives.\nHe ceased not barking at me to become noble, striving... like the dog barking at the full moons.'\nIbn Tahir took it and said:\n'And we killed you with satire... but you are a dog with a hooked tail.'\nHe combined the ugliness of theft and weakness of expression. There is no reason to mention hooking in the tail, because it does not indicate long life. This is apparent and its like is many.\nThird: Transferring what is beautiful in meaning and structure to what is ugly in structure and meaning. Al-Kindi said:\n'Did you not see that I, whenever I came knocking... found fragrance in her even if she did not perfume herself?'\nBashar took it and said:\n'And if you brought an onion near her... musk would overcome the smell of the onion.'\nThis is the lowest poetry in baseness, just as Al-Kindi's verse is the highest verse in quality and sturdiness. Kuthayyir took the meaning, so he lengthened, included, and shortened, claiming that if she fumigated herself she was like a garden in its fragrance. This is not lacking in the most malodorous of humans in body and dirtiest in state, and his poetry is known.\nFourth: Reversing what becomes by reversal satire after being praise. Hassan bin Thabit said:\n'White of faces, noble of lineages... high of noses (proud), from the first style.'\nIbn Abi Fanan took it and reversed it, saying:\n'Black of faces, mean of lineages... flat of noses, from the last style.'\nFifth: Transferring what its meters and rhymes are beautiful to what is ugly and heavy on the tongue of its narrator. Al-Hakami said:\n'Leave blaming me, for blame is incitement... and cure me with that which was the disease.'\nAl-Ta'i took it and said:\n'Enough, slow down, you have exceeded in excess... how much you blame while you are my friends?'\nAl-Hakami scolded his blamer with a gentle scolding, informing him that blame is incitement, and occupied the end of his verse with another meaning, with moist speech and sweet meaning. Al-Ta'i scolded his blamer with abusive wording difficult to narrate, and its rhyme is detested.\nSixth: The poet deleting from his speech what is of its completeness. Al-Kindi said:\n'She looked at you with the eye of a Jaziah (gazelle sufficing with moisture)... wide-eyed, bending over a child.'\nAl-Musayyab bin Alas took it and said:\n'She looked at you with the eye of a Jaziah... in the shade of a solitary Sidr tree.'",

    "text": "The ugliness of this borrowing did not satisfy him, neither in wording nor meaning, until he added unnecessary elements, because the beauty of the gazelle's eyes has no relation to the shade of the sidr tree, nor is there anything unique in it compared to others. Al-Kindi, when describing her spring as a spring of the gazelle, which had sipped the dates from the water, mentioned that she was a Houri, then described her as tender with her child, and in her tenderness, her glance reflected caution and fear—something absent in stillness and safety. Al-Musayyab stole something and left what completes the meaning; recognize it. \n\nSeventh: Preference of the original speaker’s words over those who borrow from him. Muslim said: 'As for satire, your honor is subtle below it… and praise for you, as you know, is noble. Go forth, you are free in your honor; it is an honor you cherish even when humiliated.' Al-Ta’i took it and said: 'Advisors told me, and it is said, to disparage the ignorant in praise is true; in satire there is strength and elevation.' Between the two forms, the difference is far, needing no further clarification due to the obvious distinction. \n\nEighth: Transferring sweet words from rhymes to harsh, awkward expressions. Al-Tallamis said: 'He lowered as bravely as if he saw … the path for his fangs,' taken by Amr ibn Sha’s as a whole and closed with an awkward rhyme: 'He lowered as bravely as if he saw … the path for his fangs.' Azamm: intensified and bit; the term is not sweet. \n\nNinth: Transferring what belongs to inquiry and critique to apparent flaw or corruption. Abu al-‘Atahiya said: 'I seek refuge from the one whose heart thrilled … with Ayat al-Kursi; Ayat al-Kursi wards off devils and protects from harm, but was the heart stirred in this way?' Al-A’sha said: 'I aimed at the negligence of his eyes for his goat … hitting the heart and spleen.' Mention of the heart and chest is common in poetry about love and longing; the spleen, however, is rarely mentioned, as it has no poetic relation to sorrow or passion, making its mention inappropriate. Another said: 'When I imagined burdens, I thought them … always like soft, compacted palm branches.' This is incorrect as only palms can be compacted. The Arabs and others have poetry of this kind beyond the grasp of any researcher or selector. \n\nTenth: Taking both the word and its meaning as claimed. This is the ugliest and lowest form of theft. Al-Kindi said: 'And Ans, like the boards of Iran, I spread it … on a lover like frost with scribbles,' taken word-for-word. He said: 'The worst thief among people.' Amoun said: 'Like the boards of Iran, I spread it … on a lover as if the back of a tower.' Al-Hutay’ah said: 'If it is said that my killer … is from love,' Thabit and Yazid took it beautifully. Muslim ibn al-Walid said: 'My companion says, and they hastened … and the horses lined the riders with reins. At sunrise, you desire to lead us … I said no, but the sunrise of generosity.' Abu Tammam said: 'He says of a people, my companion took … from us the night and the steps of the Mehri horses. At sunrise, you desire to lead us … I said no, but the sunrise of generosity.'",

    "text": "These are the forms of plagiarism (Sariqa); I have removed its veil for you, and thrown its rein to you. You will rarely find anyone who knows its divisions or seeks rain from its clouds. You only find one who, if he finds a plagiarized verse, does not know if it is of the praiseworthy or the blameworthy, and whether its poet is excused in it or blamed, so know it.\nAs for Tawaurd (coincidence), it is the agreement of thoughts in a verse or two verses. They only named it Tawaurd out of disdain for mentioning theft and pride against being marked by it. Alqama bin Abada said:\n'Or is an old man who wept, and did not exhaust his tears... after the loved ones, on the day of separation, rewarded (mashkum)?'\nAws bin Hajar said:\n'Or is an old man who wept, and did not exhaust his tears... after the loved ones, on the day of separation, excused?'\nTarafa said:\n'Were it not for three that are of the youth's need... by your grandfather, I would not care when my visitors rose.'\nNuhayk said:\n'Were it not for three that are of the youth's need... by your grandfather, I would not care when my buriers rose.'\nMuzahim al-Uqayli said:\n'Its dwellings almost say from decay... to its questioner about its people: Do not labor.'\nDabi' said:\n'Its dwellings almost say from decay... to its questioner about its people: Do not labor.'\nAdi bin Zaid said:\n'And a blamer who woke up at night blaming me... when she exceeded in blame, I said to her: Be moderate.'\nAmr bin Sha's said:\n'And a blamer who woke up at night blaming me... when she exceeded in blame, I said to her: Gently.'\nAws bin Hajar said:\n'A camel whose brother is her father from a hybrid [mother]... and her uncle is her maternal uncle, long-necked, fertile.'\nKa'b bin Zuhair said:\n'A camel whose brother is her father from a hybrid [mother]... and her uncle is her maternal uncle, long-necked, brisk.'\nKa'b al-Ashqari said:\n'They did not ride horses except after they aged... so they are heavy on their shoulders, leaning.'\nJarir said:\n'They did not ride horses except after they aged... so they are heavy on their shoulders, patient.'\nVerses like these in the poetry of the Arabs are more than can be counted and greater than can be exhausted. I do not count that as Tawaurd where thoughts agreed and consciences resembled, but I count it as pure theft and a raid on poetry, scattered. Ibn al-Sikkit cited the saying of Imru' al-Qais: 'Stopping at it my companions', the verse, and the saying of Tarafa in the chapter of thefts, and what he went to is the correct view. It only happens that two poets agree on a meaning and adhere to organizing it on a single rhyme, so they might coincide in some speech. Of that is what Abu al-Qasim al-Andalusi and others narrated regarding the poetry of the Maghrebis. He said: There was before Muhammad bin Abbad, the ruler of the Algarve, a slave girl with a cup in her hand serving him drink. Lightning flashed, so she was terrified by it and the cup fell from her hand. He said, improvising:\n'Lightning terrified her while in her palm... was lightning from the coffee [wine], shining.\nI wish I knew, while she is the sun of the forenoon... how does she get terrified by lights?'\nThen he said to some of his servants: Who is at the gate of the palace among the poets? He said: Abdul Jalil bin Wahbun. So he ordered him to be brought. When he stood before him, he told him the story and recited the first verse to him and said to him: Complete it. So he composed:\n'And you will never see anything more amazing than a friendly one... who, from the likes of it which she holds, is terrified.'\nThe likes of this can occur and is neither denied nor pushed away. Al-Andalusi narrated, saying: Muhammad bin Sharaf al-Qayrawani told me, saying: Al-Mu'izz bin Badis ordered me and ordered Hasan bin Rashiq at one time to describe the banana in poetry on the letter Ghayn. Each of us sat apart from his companion so that neither of us would know what the other was composing. When we finished the poetry, we presented it to him. What I composed was:\n'Oh how wonderful is the banana and its happiness... before the chewer chews it.\nIt is soft so we do not perceive a touch for it... so the mouth is full of it, empty.\nEqual we said is a food good... in it, or otherwise a drink easy to swallow.'\nAnd what Ibn Rashiq composed was:\n'A banana quick in its swallowing... before the chewing of the chewer.\nAn edible for an eater... and a drink for a swallower.\nSo the mouth, from softness in it... is full like empty.'",

    "text": "This is what is possible in Tawaurd and agreement of thoughts. Al-Qayrawani narrated, saying: Then he ordered us immediately to work on it also on the letter Dhal. We worked according to the first rule. What I composed was:\n'Do you have a desire for a banana which when... we tasted it we said: How wonderful!\nIn it is drink and food... it shows you mote like water.\nIf one who found pleasure... in it died, it would be said: This for that.'\nAnd what Ibn Rashiq composed was:\n'To Allah belongs a delicious banana... the seeker of refuge seeks refuge [by God] from it.\nFruits and a drink... by which the critically ill recovers.\nThe mote of the eye is seen in it... as the wine shows it.'\nThe poetry is very weak, and we only intended by citing it to exemplify how coincidences occur, and in this example is sufficiency.\n\n31 - As for Criticism (Naqd), in poetry it indicates the acumen of the scholar, the brightness of his sense, and the burning of his intelligence. Scholars have regarding that good sayings and useful speech, which is abundant and plentiful. We only mention a little of it and make it a guide to the much. It was said: Alqama bin Abada and Imru' al-Qais disputed in poetry, which of them was more poetic than the other. Alqama said: I accept your wife Umm Jundab as a judge between me and you. Umm Jundab said: Say poetry and describe your two horses in it on one rhyme and one meter (Rawi). Imru' al-Qais said:\n'My two friends, pass by Umm Jundab with me... let us fulfill the needs of the tormented heart.'\nAlqama said:\n'You went from abandonment in a non-doctrine... and the length of this avoidance was not right.'\nThey recited the two poems to her. She said to Imru' al-Qais: Alqama is more poetic than you. He said to her: And how is that? She said: Because you said:\n'So for the scolding is a blaze, and for the leg a flow [of milk/sweat/blood?]... and for the whip from him is the fall of a swift male ostrich.'\nAl-Akhraj: The male ostrich, and the female is Kharja'. Al-Akhraj: Ash color, and he likened [the whip mark/color] to it. Muhdhib means fast in its running. She said: So you exhausted your horse by your scolding and extracted [effort] from him, so you tired him with your leg and whip. Alqama said:\n'So he caught up with them secondarily from his rein... passing like the passing of the pouring cloud.'\nSo he caught up with his horse secondarily from his rein, and did not hit him with a whip nor tire him. Imru' al-Qais got angry at her and divorced her, so Alqama married her and was named Al-Fahl (The Stallion) for his distinction over the rest of the poets like the distinction of the stallion over the rest of the camels. Al-Asma'i recited the saying of Imru' al-Qais:\n'Many a shooter from Banu Thu'al... taking out his palms (Zandayhi) from his covers.'\nHe said: Did he not know that the hunter is more intense in stealth than to show anything of himself! Then he said: So 'his palms' (Kaffayhi), if it must be, is more correct. So the narrators left 'his forearms' (Zandayhi) and narrated 'his palms' (Kaffayhi) despite what is in it. It was said: A red leather dome used to be set up for Al-Nabigha al-Dhubyani in the market of Ukaz, and poets would come to him and present their poetry to him. The first to recite to him was Al-A'sha Maymun bin Qais, then Hassan bin Thabit al-Ansari recited his saying:\n'We have the white bowls shining in the forenoon... and our swords drip blood from bravery.\nWe begot Banu al-Anqa' and the two sons of Muharriq... so how noble are we as uncles, and how noble are we as sons.'\nAl-Nabigha said to him: You are a poet, but you diminished your bowls and your swords, and boasted of whom you begot and did not boast of who begot you. This is the majestic criticism indicated by the purity of Al-Nabigha's speech. The meaning is that he said to him: You diminished your swords, and 'Asyaf' is a plural of paucity (few number), and the plural of multitude is 'Suyuf'. And 'Jafanat' is for paucity, and the multitude is 'Jifan'. He said: You boasted of whom you begot; because he left boasting of his fathers and boasted of whom his women begot. It was said in a narration not trusted: That he said to him: And you said: 'We have the white (Ghurr) bowls', and Ghurra is a spot of whiteness in the bowl. If you had said: 'We have the white (Bid) bowls', it would have been better due to the abundance of grease on them. And if you had said: 'Shining in the darkness (Duja)', it would have been more eloquent. And if you had said: 'And our swords run (Yajrina)', it would have been more eloquent than 'drip (Yaqturna)' because running is greater than dripping. I say that this addition has objections against it. The correct is what Al-Nabigha said first. Ibn Abbad Abu al-Qasim, may Allah have mercy on him and be pleased with him, mentioned that Abu al-Fadl bin al-Amid used to exceed the criticism of verses to the criticism of letters and words, and would not be satisfied with refining the meaning and wording until he demanded the beautification of the rhyme and meter. He said: I recited one day in his presence the poem of Abu Tammam which begins:\n'I witnessed, your dwellings have become desolate after me... and worn out as the stripes of a cloak wore out.'",

    "text": "Until I reached his saying:\n'Generous, whenever I praise him, I praise him and mankind... are with me, and whenever I blame him, I blame him alone.'\nHe said: Do you know a fault in this verse? I said: Yes, he countered praise with blame, so he did not fulfill the correspondence its due, as the due of praise is to be countered with satire and dispraise. He said: I intended other than this. I said: I do not know. He said: One of the things needed in poetry is the soundness of the letters of the word from heaviness. This repetition in 'amdahuhu, amdahhu' (I praise him, I praise him), with the combination of Ha' (heavy H) and Ha' (soft H) twice, and they are guttural letters, is outside the limit of moderation, repelling with all repulsion. I said: This is not perceived except by one to whom the aspects of knowledge have submitted and whose nature has raised him to their peaks. It was said: Al-Asma'i heard the saying of Al-A'sha:\n'As if her walk from the house of her neighbor... is the passing of a cloud, neither slow nor hasty.'\nHe said: He made her frequently going out and entering (Kharraja Wallaja). Why did he not say as the other said:\n'And her neighbors honor her so they visit her... and she makes excuses for not coming to them, so she is excused.'\nI say: Criticism of poetry is a craft that no one knows truly except one who has been pushed into the straits of poetry and swallowed the chokings of its difficulty upon him, and knew how to storm its abysses and throw himself into it. Abu al-Abbas Muhammad bin Yazid al-Mubarrad said: Umara bin Aqil bin Bilal bin Jarir said to me: Marwan bin Abi Hafsa said to me: Al-Ma'mun has no insight into poetry. I said to him: And how is that, when we recite to him the beginning of the verse and he anticipates us to its end, having not heard it before? He said: I said a good poem about him, but he did not shake for it. He said: I said to him: And what did you say about him? He recited to me:\n'The Imam of Guidance, Al-Ma'mun, has become busy... with religion, and people are busy with the world.'\nHe said: I said to him: You did nothing. You did no more than making him an old woman in her prayer niche with her rosary in her hand. Who will undertake the matter of the world if the Caliph is busy from it, while he is the one burdened with its matter? Why did you not say as your uncle Jarir said about Abdul Aziz bin al-Walid bin Abdul Malik:\n'So neither is he in the world wasting his share... nor does the offer of the world distract him from religion.'\nThis is good criticism. Abu Uthman al-Jahiz narrated, saying: I sought the knowledge of poetry at Al-Asma'i's, but found him knowing only its strange words. I returned to Al-Akhfash, but found him mastering only its grammar. I turned to Abu Ubayda, but saw him penetrating only in what connected to news and related to days (battles) and lineages. I did not obtain what I wanted except at the literary scribes; like Al-Hasan bin Wahb and Muhammad bin Abdul Malik al-Zayyat. To Allah is the goodness of Abu Uthman! He dove into the secret of poetry and extracted what is more subtle than magic. A poet is judged over another by one verse, and a verse is preferred over another by one word. Do you not see the saying of Imru' al-Qais:\n'Stopping at it my companions, their mounts over me... saying: Do not perish of sorrow and beautify yourself (tajammal).'\nAnd the saying of Tarafa the verse in its entirety, then he ended it with his saying: 'and have endurance (tajallad).' They are both excellent poets, and we assumed they coincided, and did not judge Tarafa with theft. We were invited to judge between them, and prefer one of the two verses over the other, and there is no difference in them except 'tajammul' and 'tajallud'. From good criticism is preferring 'tajammul' over 'tajallud', and ruling the verse for its owner, because 'tajammul' is showing improvement from strength and a continuous material of capability. And 'tajallud' is showing improvement from weakness, and a continuous material of inability. Between the two words is a far distance. If we were invited to judge between Laqit bin Zurara and who followed his path in his saying:\n'A youth who buys good praise with his wealth... so it remains, and you did not keep the likes of praiseworthy deeds.'\nAnd the saying of Al-Hakami:\n'A youth who buys good praise with his wealth... and knows that the circles (of fortune) turn.'\nAnd the saying of the other:\n'A youth who buys good praise with his wealth... when the ash-colored year, its rain is little.'",

    "text": "Criticism would necessitate judging entitlement to preference for the author of the last verse. That is because Laqit bin Zurara ended his verse with a good proverb, and Abu Nuwas ended his verse with confirming generosity, and its meaning: That the praised one buys praise with his money knowing that he might become poor, or need others, as others needed him. As for the other, he mentioned that he gives his money and buys praise with it in the difficult time when a human must preserve his money due to the intense need for it. If he gives it in such a difficult time and spends it in days of drought and famine, how would he be in a time of fertility and abundance of good and provision? By such a trait, Hatim bin Abdullah al-Ta'i was judged with generosity. Hatim was triumphant: if he fought he conquered, if asked he gave, if he took booty he let it be plundered, if he captured he released, and if he became wealthy he spent. He had sworn by Allah Almighty not to kill the only son of his mother. Muhammad bin Habib narrated from Musa al-Ahwal from Al-Haytham from Malhan, the nephew of Mawiya wife of Hatim, from his aunt Mawiya, she said: A year [of drought] befell the people that took away the camel and the cloven-hoofed (sheep/goats). We spent a night in extreme hunger and we owned nothing. Hatim took Adi and I took Saffana; we distracted them until they slept. Then Hatim began distracting me with talk so I would sleep. I pitied him for the fatigue he was in, so I refrained from his speech and pretended to him that I had slept so he would sleep. He looked from the slit of the tent, and behold a person approaching. He raised his head and behold a woman saying: 'O Abu Saffana, I came to you from hungry children.' He jumped up quickly and said: 'Bring them to me, for by Allah I will satisfy them.' When she brought them, while I was thinking about what he wanted to do, he stood hurriedly to his horse—and he owned nothing else—slaughtered it, roasted it, and fed them. Then he said: 'By Allah, this indeed is meanness; how can you eat while the people of the camp are in a state like yours?' He began going to the camp, tent by tent, saying: 'Come to the fire.' A number gathered around him and left nothing of it, while he was wrapped in his cloak sitting aside. By Allah, he did not taste a morsel of it. This, by Allah, is pure generosity and sheer munificence. If his generosity in such a state was like this, how would it be in other states? This is the end of the first chapter. Perhaps the looker into it finds its sections long and its prolixity great, especially since we stipulated at its beginning brevity and promised to avoid excess. If the looker into it knew what we left behind us and cast behind our backs of strange meanings and wondrous poems, he would know the place of brevity and the fulfillment of what we promised of restriction. This is with turning away from much of the poetry of the moderns and the proficient ancients. And Allah is the Granter of success to what is right.\n\n**Chapter Two**\n**On What is Permissible for the Poet to Use and What is Not**\n**And What the Correctness of Speech is Realized By and Permitted**\n\nWhat is permissible for the Muwallad (post-classical/modern) poet to use in his poetry of necessity (Darura) is all that the Arabs used in their poems of necessities, except what I exclude for you and clarify to you. The Muwallad, in the necessities of his poetry and committing its difficulties, is more excused than the Arab who speaks in his language by his nature. As for what is not permissible for the Muwallad to use, and is not tolerated in committing, it is all that came from the Arabs as solecism (Lahn) which Arabic does not swallow and its people do not permit, whether in the middle of the verse or in its rhyme. For solecism is not permissible to emulate, nor to descend into its branches. Of that is the solecism they called 'Jarr 'ala al-Mujawara' (Genitive by Proximity). The poet said:\n'So O assembly of Arabs, if your drinking is permissible... then do not drink what a rider performed Hajj for Allah (Hajja lillahi rakibin).'\n'A drink for Ghazwan the wicked, for he... forbids you from it with oaths of a liar (bi-aymani kadhibin).'\nThis is an ugly solecism, and its correct form is: 'ma hajja lillahi rakibun' (what a rider performed Hajj for Allah [nominative]). Another said:\n'I circle it seeing none other than it... as the monk circled the church (kama tafa bil-bay'ati al-rahibi).'\nHe made 'Al-Rahib' (monk) genitive by proximity, which is an ugly solecism, and its correct form is: 'kama tafa bil-bay'ati al-rahibu' (as the monk circled the church [nominative]). Another said:\n'Like the weaving of the spider, the weak (Al-murmali).'\nIts correct form is 'Al-murmali' (weak/loose - [in context maybe Al-murhala? or Al-murmali genitive? Need context for grammatical case. Usually spider web described as wahin/weak. If Al-murmal describes nasj (weaving - accusative/nominative) it should match. If genitive, maybe matching Ankabut? Text says Lahn, implies incorrect case]). As for the saying of the other:\n'As if Thabir (mountain) in the foreparts of its rain... is a chief of people in a striped garment wrapped (muzammali).'\nIt has a face mentioned by Abu al-Fath, which is that he intended 'muzammalin fihi' (wrapped in it), so he deleted the preposition, so the pronoun rose and became hidden in the passive participle. Much of this has appeared, like the saying of the other:",

    "text": "'As if she struck before her eyes... cotton with the tightness of strings ginned (mahlu ji).'\nIts correct form is 'mahlujan' (accusative). All of that, they only brought it based on what was narrated from the Arabs of their saying: 'Hadha juhru dabbin kharibin' (This is the hole of a lizard, ruined [genitive]), while 'ruined' is not an attribute of the lizard. Al-Khalil bin Ahmad said: Their saying 'Hadha juhru dabbin kharibin' was only narrated from them by way of mistake. The proof of that is that when they used the dual, they only said 'juhra dabbin kharibani' (two holes of a lizard, ruined [nominative/dual]), because the mistake here becomes clear. It only occurred in the singular due to the gathering of the hole and the lizard in singularity. Likewise, if they used the plural, the mistake disappears, like your saying: 'Hadhihi juhratu dibabin kharibatun' (These are holes of lizards, ruined [nominative]). The investigators among the people of knowledge do not permit working according to proximity. We are not making one saying prevail over another, nor do we have a purpose in that. However, the Muwallad poet is not permitted to work according to proximity. This was not narrated for any of the proficient Muwallads, nor did the scholars of poetry permit it for them, whether the Arabs were correct in it or mistaken. The intent is that it is prohibited for the Muwallads. \nAmong what is not permissible for the Muwallads to use is what the Arabs used of advancing and delaying (Ta'qim wa Ta'khir) and separation (Fasl) for which there is no justification. It is not permissible for the Muwallad to follow it or emulate it, for it is a repugnant solecism, like the saying of the poet:\n'She has the two eyes of a wild cow (hawra'), bedewed a thicket... from the wild beasts, its arar plants do not cease grazing.'\nHe intended: She has the two eyes of a wild cow (hawra') from the wild beasts, grazing a thicket whose arar plants are bedewed, which does not cease [grazing]. Another said:\n'Indeed—and doubt is clear to me, trouble—... with the imminence of their separation, a shrike shouting.'\nHe intended: Indeed, a shrike shouting with the imminence of their separation has become clear to me, and doubt is trouble. Another said:\n'So it became after the line of its joy... as if a pen were a wasteland, its traces.'\nHe intended: So it became a wasteland after its joy, as if a pen lined its traces. Such is frequent. You can see what is in these verses of separations and advancing and delaying. The like of this is not permissible for the early Bedouins, let alone the later Muwallads. It is not permissible for anyone to take it as a norm to work upon. \nAmong what is not permissible for the Muwallads to emulate or work upon, because it is a gross solecism, is Iqwa' in the rhyme. That is for the poet to make a verse nominative (Marfu') and a verse genitive (Majrur), like the saying of Al-Nabigha:\n'Is there from the family of Mayya a departer or an early goer (mughtadi)... hasty, with provision or without provision (muzawwadi)?\nThe hot summer winds claimed that our journey is tomorrow... and of that the black raven informed us (al-aswadu).'\nOh wonder, how did that escape Al-Nabigha despite his good criticism of poetry, soundness of taste, and perception of the obscure secrets of it? You have known what he took from Hassan bin Thabit of what thoughts are bewildered in. When he was alerted to the place of the error, it did not reach his understanding nor did he pay attention to it until a singing girl sang it while he was present. When she prolonged 'khabbarana al-ghurabu al-aswadu', and the Damma in 'Al-Aswad' after the Dal became clear, he realized that and knew it was Iqwa', so he changed it and said: 'wa bi-dhaka tan'abu al-ghurabi al-aswadi' (and of that is the croaking of the black raven). And like the saying of Muzarrid bin Dirar from verses:\n'Did Al-Tha'la' not know—may her milk not flow... Fazara—that the right to the guest is obligatory (wajibu)?'\nAnd from it:\n'I looked askance and peered at him so I saw him... so I said to him: Are you Zaid of the Rabbits (al-aranibi)?'\nAnd like the saying of Hassan bin Thabit:\n'There is no harm in the people in terms of height and size... the body of mules and the dreams of sparrows (al-asafiri).\nAs if they are hollow reeds, their bottoms... pierced, in which the whirlwinds blew (al-a'asiru).'\nNasb (accusative) does not occur with Jarr (genitive) nor with Raf' (nominative) in Iqwa'. By my life, all of it is rejected solecism, and nothing of that was narrated from them. Raf' and Jarr only gather due to the closeness of each one to the other. And because Waw is assimilated into Ya', and they are permissible in the Ridf (letter before Rawi) in one poem. When Waw became close to Ya' this closeness, they imagined its permissibility with it, and that is a mistake and error. The Muqayyad (bound rhyme) has no Majra (vowel of the Rawi), meaning the movement of the Rawi letter; it is only for the Mutlaq (released rhyme). I think that whoever of the Arabs committed Iqwa' did not recite poetry as Mutlaq, but recited it as Muqayyad and paused at its rhyme, like the saying of Durayd bin al-Simma:\n'I looked at him while the spears were seizing him... like the falling of weaver's shuttles on the stretched fabric (al-mumaddad - pause).\nSo I frightened the people away from him until they scattered... and until the intense black color overcame me (aswad - pause).'",

    "text": "In summary, it is an excuse not bad. Some of our Sheikhs narrated to me, raising it to Abu Sa'id al-Sirafi, he said: I attended the assembly of Abu Bakr bin Duraid, and I had not seen him before that. I sat at the tail of the assembly. One of the attendees recited two verses attributed to Adam, peace be upon him, when his son Cain killed his brother Abel, which are:\n'The lands changed and who is on them... so the face of the earth is dusty, ugly (qabihu).\nEvery possessor of beauty and goodness changed... and the cheerfulness of the beautiful face decreased (al-malihu).'\nAbu Bakr said: 'This is poetry said at the beginning of the world and Iqwa' occurred in it.' I said: 'It has a face that removes it from Iqwa'.' He said: 'What is it?' I said: 'Deleting the Tanwin from \"bashashata\" due to the meeting of two sakin (silent letters), making it accusative for specification (Tamyiz/Tafsir), and making \"al-wajhu\" nominative by assigning \"qalla\" to it. If the Tanwin were moved due to the meeting of two sakins, it would be: \"wa qalla bashashatan al-wajhu al-malihu\".' When he heard this, he said: 'Rise.' He raised me until he seated me by his side. \nAmong what is not permissible for Muwallads to use, and no license was narrated for anyone in the like of it: Ikfa'. It is the difference of the Rawi letter. An example of that is the saying of the Rajiz:\n'My son, indeed righteousness is an easy thing... the good speech and the little food (al-tu'ayyim - Mim).'\nAnd the saying of another:\n'If a thief comes to me, I am a thief (lissu - Sad)... wolf-colored like the wolf when he prowls (ya'tassu - Sin).\nMy driving is my singing and my whistling is the hiss (al-nassu - Sin).'\nAmong what is not permissible for the Muwallad to use is Ita': It is that the poet rhymes with a word in a verse, then brings it in another verse close to the first. If the distance between the two verses is ten verses or more, the sin is forgiven, the defect covered, and it moves from prohibited to disliked. If one of the two rhymes is definite and the other indefinite, the dislike is removed and it is closer to permissibility than prohibition. The Arabs have committed Ita' frequently. Al-Nabigha al-Dhubyani said:\n'Or I place the house in a dumb, dark land... restricting the wild ass, the night traveler does not travel in it (al-sari).'\nThen he said after a few verses:\n'He does not lower the sound from a land he visited... nor does the night traveler go astray upon his lamp (al-sari).'\nIbn Muqbil said:\n'Or like the shaking of a Rudayni spear handled by... the hands of merchants, so they increased its shaft in softness (lina).'\nThen he said after verses:\n'I disputed their minds with my mind with a brief... of conversations until they increased me in softness (lina).'\nAmong what is not permissible for the Muwallad to use is Sinad: It is the difference of every movement before the Rawi letter, like the saying of Amr bin al-Ahtam al-Taghlibi:\n'Did you not see that Taghlib are people of might... mountains of strongholds not ascended (yurtaqayna - Fatha).\nWe drank from the blood of Banu Sulaym... with the tips of spears until we quenched (rawina - Kasra).'\nThe Fatha of the Qaf and the Kasra of the Waw is Sinad, not permissible, because one of the two Hadhws (vowel before Ridf) follows the Ridf and the other opposes it. Al-Khalil permitted Damma with Kasra and forbade Damma with Fatha. If there is Damma or Kasra with Fatha, it is Sinad. As for what he permitted, it is like the saying of Tarafa:\n'A phantom kept the eye sleepless, it did not rest (yaqir - Kasra)... He loathed, while the riders were in the desert of Yusur (yusur - Damma).'\nThis is Damma with Kasra, and it is good. As for what he forbade and mentioned as Sinad, it is like the saying of Ru'ba:\n'And dark of depths, empty of the crossing place (al-mukhtaraq - Fatha).'\nThen he said:\n'He united scattered ones, not being the foolish shepherd (al-hamiq - Kasra).'\nHe combined Fatha and Kasra. Then he said:\n'Compact, strong-backed, huge, youthful camel (funuq - Damma).'\nHe brought Damma with Fatha and Kasra, and it is an ugly Sinad; the like of it is not permissible to use. Similar to it in ugliness and combining Kasra, Fatha, and Damma is the saying of Al-A'sha:\n'Your raiding with horses the land of the enemy... so today from a raid you did not recoil (takhim - Kasra).\nAnd their army looks at the morning... and its young ones are like the rejected of date pits (al-'ajam - Fatha).\nSitting with what was of armor... and they are standing chewing the bridles (al-lujum - Damma).'\nAbu Amr al-Jarmi narrated that Al-Akhfash did not consider that Sinad and said: 'That has come frequently from the eloquent Arabs.' The reliance is on what Al-Khalil said, nothing else. Al-Khalil permitted the coming of Ya' with Waw in like 'mashib' and 'khutub', and 'amir' and 'wu'ur'. If you add a Ridf to a verse and leave another [without Ridf], it is Sinad and a defect not to be woven upon its loom, like the saying of the poet:\n'If you are sending someone for a need... then send a wise man and do not advise him (tushi-hi).'",

    "text": "'And if a door of a matter is twisted against you... then consult an intelligent man and do not disobey him (ta'si-hi).'\nThe Waw in 'tushi-hi' is a Ridf, and the Sad is the Rawi letter, and the second verse does not have a Ridf (is not Murdaf). This is Sinad, and it is an ugly defect that rarely occurred. Al-Khalil bin Ahmad said: I arranged the Bayt (verse) of poetry like the arrangement of the Bayt (house) of hair (tent), meaning the tent. He said: So I named Iqwa' what came of nominative in poetry and genitive on one rhyme. I only named it Iqwa' for its contrariety, because the Arabs say: 'Aqwa al-fatilu' (The twister made strong/different strands) if a strand of the rope comes differing from the rest of the strands. He said: And I named the change of what is before the Rawi letter Sinad; from the supporting (Musanada) of a verse to a verse if each of them is thrown upon its companion, not being even like this. He said: And I named Ikfa' what the letter of its Rawi was disturbed, so it came once Nun, once Mim, and once Lam. The Arabs do that due to the closeness of the exit of Mim from Nun, like his saying:\n'Daughters of a trampler on the cheek of the night (al-layl - Lam)... they do not complain of pain as long as they are selected (anqayn - Nun).'\nTaken from their saying: 'Bayt Mukfa'' (An overturned/slanted tent) if its flaps which are at its rear differ. Al-Kifa': The flap at the rear of the tent. Ita' is repeating the rhyme twice, like his saying:\n'And disgraces you, O son of the blacksmith, the days of Darim... and Amr bin Amr when he called O family of Darim.'\nHe stepped (awta'a) a rhyme upon a rhyme, he named it Ita'. As for Tadmin, it is that the verse is built on speech whose meaning is in a verse following it, requiring it. Like the saying of the poet:\n'And Sa'd, so ask them, and Al-Rabab... and ask Hawazin about us if.\nWe met them, how rise above them... cutting swords splitting helmets and heads.'\nAll these defects are not permissible for the Muwallads to commit because they have known their ugliness, and witnessed in others their sting and scorch, while the Bedouin did not pay attention to them. Among what is not permissible for the Muwallad to use is breaking the Nun of the plural in like the saying of Jarir:\n'A thicket from Urayna is not of us... I am innocent to Urayna from a thicket (Arini - Kasra).\nWe knew Ja'far and Banu Ubayd... and we denied others, rabble (Akharini - Kasra).'\nThis is solecism, and its correct form is 'Akharina', with open Nun. Suhaym bin Wathil said:\n'I excused the old camels if they wagered me... so what is my concern and the concern of the two-year-old camels (Ibnay Labuni - Kasra).\nAnd what do the poets know of me... when I have passed the head of forty (Al-Arba'ini - Kasra).'\nThe correct is opening the Nun of Al-Arba'in. Al-Farazdaq said addressing Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf when the death announcement of his brother Muhammad came to him on the day his son Muhammad died:\n'I am weeping for the two sons of Yusuf in anxiety... and the like of their loss for religion makes me weep.\nNo living nor dead blocked their place... except the Caliphs after the Prophets (Al-Nabiyyini - Kasra).'\nHe broke the Nun of Al-Nabiyyin, and the correct is opening it. Al-Mubarrad has speech on that. All this is not permissible for the Muwallad to emulate or use as argument. For that Al-Sayyid al-Himyari says:\n'Indeed my tongue is an instrument that does not betray me... and indeed I am precise in what I bring of the matter.\nI weave and do not commit Iqwa' and am not making solecisms... and how many a sayer of poetry commits Iqwa' and solecism.'\nAdi bin al-Riqa' said:\n'And a poem I spent the night gathering... until I straightened its inclination and its Sinad.\nThe look of the straightener at the nodes of his spear... until his straightening tool rectifies its bend.'\nAbu Bakr al-Suli recited, he said: Awn bin Muhammad al-Kindi recited to me for some of them, and was witty:\n'Indeed there was in your eyes, O Amr, a distraction... and a nose like the sheath of the old camel, from what you follow.\nYou followed a solecism in the speech of a decorating poet... while your face is built on solecism entirely.\nSo your eyes are Iqwa', your nose is Mukfa'... and your face is Ita', so you are the patched one.'\nIt is narrated: 'Your ears are Iqwa', your nose is Mukfa'... and your eyes are Ita', so you are the patched one.'\nIbn Jurayj said about Sawwar bin Abi Shura'a:\n'And mentioning you in poetry is like Sinad... and Kharm and Khazm or like the impossible.\nAnd Ita' of poetry and its Ikfa'... and its Iqwa' without mentioning the vile.\nPoetry is not faulted by a defect belonging to it... like being afflicted by men of baseness.\nSatire is made available for the satirist of satire... a chronic disease for a chronic disease.'\nWe have cited these verses for the position of finding their defects ugly and likening the states of the satirized to them, confirming their ugliness in the soul and inciting avoiding them to remove ambiguity. What is permissible for the Muwallad poet to commit of necessity in his poetry is to decline (make Munfarif) what is indeclinable (Ghayr Munsarif), because the origin of all nouns is declension (Sarf). Causes only occurred to them preventing them from declension. If the poet declines what is indeclinable, he has returned it to its origin. The poet said:\n'Da'd did not wrap herself with the surplus of her waist-wrapper... nor was Da'd fed with milking vessels (al-'ulabi).'\nAl-'ulab is plural of 'ulba, which is a huge wooden cup used for milking. He declined Da'd and left declension in one verse. As for the poet coming to what is declinable and leaving its declension, it is not permissible because it is taking the thing out of its origin, and taking things out of their origins corrupts the standards of speech in them. Al-Akhfash argued for the permissibility of that with the saying of Al-Abbas bin Mirdas al-Sulami, which is:\n'Neither Hisn nor Habis were... surpassing Mirdas (Mirdasa - non-declined) in an assembly.'\nHe left the declension of Mirdas, which is a declinable name. Abu Ali said: This is not to be used as a standard. I say: This is not permissible to do because it is an ugly solecism. Among what is permissible for the Muwallad poet to use by necessity is shortening the extended (Mamdud), but extending the shortened (Maqsur) is not permissible for him because it is a departure from the origin. As for shortening the extended, it is returning the thing to its origin. The poet said:\n'My eye wept and its weeping (Bukaha - shortened) was right for it... and weeping (Al-Buka'u - extended) and wailing do not avail.'\nHe shortened 'Buka' and extended it in one verse. Among what is not permissible to use as proof for extending the shortened, because it is contrary to the original placement agreed upon by scholars, is the saying of Al-Farazdaq:\n'O Abu Hadir, whoever fornicates, his fornication (Zina'uhu - extended) appears... and whoever drinks the wine becomes intoxicated.'\nHe extended 'Zina', which is extended in the dialect of the people of Nejd, and shortening is for the people of Hijaz, which is the language of the Quran and reliance is upon it. The reason of whoever extended Zina is that he made it an action from two, like your saying 'Ramaytuhu Rima'an' (I shot at him shooting) and 'Zanaytuhu Zina'an'. Whoever shortened it went to the view that the action is from one of them. In summary, it is transmitted, said, and others are not measured upon it. Zina in shortening is written with Ya' because it is from: Zana Yazni. As for the saying of the other:\n'He who enriched you will enrich me from me... so no poverty lasts nor riches (Ghina'u - extended).'\nThe correct narration is that its beginning is open (Fatha), because the meaning of Ghina (richness) and Ghana' (sufficiency/avail) is one. Poetry, if forced to extend the shortened, changes its beginning and directs it to what is permissible to use, like the saying of the Rajiz:\n'And the recurring of nights and changing of conditions... wears out man the wearing out (Bala' - extended) of the shirt.'\nWhen he opened the Ba' of Bila, the extension became permissible for him. The like of this is many. It is permissible for the poet to suffice with Damma instead of Waw by necessity, like the saying of the poet:\n'While he was buying his saddle, a sayer said... To whom belongs a camel loose of sides, submissive?'\nThe origin was: 'Fa-bayna huwa' (While he), so when he sufficed with Damma, he deleted the Waw. It is permissible for the Muwallad poet to return the defective noun (Manqus) to its origin in inflection by necessity, so he puts Damma on the Ya' in nominative and Kasra in genitive, as it is opened in accusative, because Damma and Kasra are intended and estimated in the Ya' even if they fell. So he says in 'Qadin' (judge) in the state of nominative 'Qadiyun' and in the state of genitive 'Qadiyin', without Hamza. Likewise in 'Jawari' and 'Ghawani'. The poet said:\n'You see him, having escaped the shooters, as if he is... in front of the dogs, inclined of cheek (Musghiyu - nominative), earless.'\nHe put Damma on the Ya' of Musghi. Ubaydullah bin Qais al-Ruqayyat said:\n'May Allah not bless the beautiful women (Al-Ghawaniyi - genitive), do they... become morning except having a demand?'\nHe put Kasra on the Ya' in Al-Ghawani. Another said:\n'I have not seen, nor do I see in my duration... like maidens (Ka-jawariyin - genitive) playing in the desert.'\nHe used two necessities: one is putting Kasra on the Ya', and the other is declining what is indeclinable. As for the saying of Al-Farazdaq:\n'If Abdullah was a client (Mawlan) I would have satirized him... but Abdullah is a client of clients (Mawaliya).'\nIts estimation is that he paused on the Ya' according to the school of those Arabs who pause on it. When the noun was completed by the return of its Lam, it became prevented from declension then because its weight became with the Ya' 'Mafa'il' after it was 'Mafa'in'. When he was forced to its movement to establish the meter, he opened it in the place of genitive as 'Masajida' is opened. As for the saying of the Rajiz:\n'He drives eight (Thamani - indeclinable form acting as object? or genitive?) fond of their milk camels.'",

    "text": "'Satire is available to the satirist of satire... a chronic disease for a chronic disease.' We have cited these verses to point out the ugliness of their flaws and to liken the conditions of the satirized person to them, emphasizing their ugliness to the soul and inciting avoidance of them to remove ambiguity. Among the poetic necessities permissible for the Muwallad (post-classical) poet to commit in his poetry is to decline what is indeclinable (treat a diptote as a triptote), because the root of all nouns is declinability (triptote). Causes only arose that prevented them from declension; so if the poet declines the indeclinable, he has returned it to its root. The poet said: 'Da'd did not wrap herself with the surplus of her waist-wrapper... and Da'd was not fed from the wooden bowls.' 'Al-'Ulab' is the plural of 'Ulbah', which is a large wooden bowl used for milking. He declined 'Da'd' and left the declension in one verse. However, for a poet to take a declinable noun and prevent its declension (treat a triptote as a diptote), this is not permissible because it is removing a thing from its root, and removing things from their roots corrupts the standards of speech regarding them. Al-Akhfash argued for the permissibility of this using the verse of Al-Abbas ibn Mirdas al-Sulami, which is: 'Neither a fortress nor a container... surpasses Mirdas in an assembly.' He prevented the declension of 'Mirdas' even though it is a declinable name. Abu Ali said: 'This cannot be used as a standard.' I say: This action is not permissible because it is an ugly grammatical error. Among what is permissible for the Muwallad poet to use as a necessity is shortening the extended noun (Mamdud), but he may not lengthen the shortened noun (Maqsur) because that is a departure from the root, whereas shortening the extended is returning the thing to its root. The poet said: 'My eye wept and its weeping (buka'aha - shortened) was its right... but weeping (al-buka' - extended) and wailing do not avail.' He shortened 'al-buka' and extended it in a single verse. Among what cannot be used as proof for extending the shortened noun—because it is contrary to the root of coinage upon which scholars agreed—is the saying of Al-Farazdaq: 'O Abu Hadir, whoever commits fornication (yazni), his fornication (zina'uhu) appears... and whoever drinks wine (al-khurtum) becomes intoxicated.' He extended 'al-zina', which is extended in the dialect of the people of Najd, but shortening it is the dialect of the people of Hijaz, which is the language of the Quran and the one relied upon. The reason for the one who extends 'al-zina' is that he made it a verb from two parties, like saying 'ramaytuhu rima'an' (I shot at him) and 'zanaytuhu zina'an', while the one who shortens it holds that the action is from one of them. In summary, it is transmitted and spoken, but others are not analogized to it. 'Al-Zina' in the shortened form is written with a 'Ya' because it comes from: 'zana yazni'. As for the saying of the other: 'The One who enriched you will enrich me from you... so neither poverty endures nor wealth (ghina'u).' The correct narration is that its beginning is open (fat-ha), because the meaning of 'al-ghina' (wealth) and 'al-ghana'' (sufficiency) is one. If poetry is compelled to extend a shortened noun, it changes its beginning and directs it to what is permissible to use, like the saying of the Rajiz poet: 'The passing of nights and the changing of conditions... wears a man out like the wearing (bala') of a shirt.' When he opened the 'Ba' of 'al-bila', the extension became permissible for him. Cases like this are many. It is permissible for the poet to suffice with the Damma (u-vowel) instead of the Waw out of necessity, as the poet said: 'So while he (baynahu) was selling his saddle, a sayer said... \"To whom belongs a camel, loose in the sides, submissive?\"' The original was: 'fa-bayna huwa' (while he), so when he sufficed with the Damma, he deleted the Waw. It is permissible for the Muwallad poet to return the defective noun (Manqus) to its root in declension out of necessity, so he marks the 'Ya' with a Damma in the nominative case and with a Kasra in the genitive case, just as it is marked with a Fatha in the accusative, because the Damma and Kasra are intended and implied in the 'Ya' even if they are dropped. So he says regarding 'Qadin' (a judge) in the nominative state 'Qadiyun' and in the genitive state 'Qadiyin', without a Hamza, and likewise in 'Jawari' and 'Ghawani'. The poet said: 'You see him, having outstripped the archers, as if he is... in front of the dogs, inclined (musghiyu) of cheek, earless.' He marked the 'Ya' of 'musghi' with a Damma. And Ubayd Allah ibn Qays al-Ruqayyat said: 'May Allah not bless the beauties (al-ghawani), do... they wake up except that they have a requirement?' He marked the 'Ya' in 'al-ghawani' with a Kasra. Another said: 'I have not seen, nor do I see in my duration... like maidens (jawariyin) playing in the desert.' He used two necessities: one is marking the 'Ya' with a Kasra, and the other is declining what is indeclinable. As for the saying of Al-Farazdaq: 'If Abdullah were a client (Mawla) I would have satirized him... but Abdullah is a client of clients (Mawla Mawaliya).' The estimation is that he paused upon the 'Ya' according to the school of those Arabs who pause upon it. When the noun was completed by the return of its 'Lam' (last radical), it was then prevented from declension because its weight with the 'Ya' became 'Mafa'il' after it was 'Mafa'in'. So when he was compelled to its vowel to establish the meter, he marked it with a Fatha in the place of the genitive, just as 'Masajida' is marked with a Fatha. As for the saying of the Rajiz: 'He drives eight (thamani) fond of their milch-camels...'",

    "text": "The poet likened 'Thamani' (eight) to 'Jawarin' (maidens) in wording not meaning, so he did not decline it. It is permissible for the Muwallad to make the Ya' silent in the state of accusative, thus attaching the accusative to the nominative and genitive, just as it was permissible for him to move the Ya' in the state of nominative and genitive, attaching the nominative and genitive to the accusative. Abu al-Abbas al-Mubarrad said: This is one of the best necessities because they likened the Ya' to the Alif, meaning that if they make it silent in the three states, the defective noun (Manqus) runs the course of the shortened noun (Maqsur), so the Ya' becomes like the Alif; since the Alif is silent in all its states. The poet said:\n'Gently, our cousins, gently, our masters (Mawalina)... do not dig up between us what was buried.'\nHe made the Ya' silent in 'Mawalina' while it is in the place of accusative. Another said:\n'As if their hands on the smooth, flat plain... are hands of maidens (Aydi Jawarin) exchanging silver.'\nHe made the Ya' silent in 'Aydiyahunna' while it is in the place of accusative, and made it silent in 'Aydi' while it is in the place of nominative. Al-Hutay'ah said:\n'O house of Hind, effaced except its tripod stones (Athafiha).'\nAl-Farazdaq said:\n'Turning a head that was not a master's head... and an eye of his, cross-eyed (Hawla'), whose defects are apparent (Badin).'\nHe intended 'Badiyan' (appearing - accusative) its defects, so he made the Ya' silent and deleted it due to the meeting of two sakins. It is possible in the saying of the other mentioned earlier:\n'Yahdu thamani mula'an bi-liqahiha'\nThat the Ya' is made silent then deleted because of Tanwin, so it would be carried on this necessity, so you say: 'Yahdu thamanin' (driving eight).\nAmong what is permissible for the Muwallad poet to use is establishing the Waw and Ya' in like 'lam yaghzu' and 'lam yarmi', so he says at necessity: 'lam yaghzuwa' and 'lam yarmiya', as if he made the Waw and Ya' silent after the obligation of movement for them. The poet said:\n'Did it not come to you (Ya'tika), while news grows... of what the milk camels of Banu Ziyad met?'\nIts origin was: 'Ya'tiyuka', so he deleted the Damma and made the Ya' silent as I informed you. Among what is permissible to use, and is very common in usage, is deleting the Tanwin due to the meeting of two sakins. Of that is the saying of the poet:\n'Humayd, he whose house is Amajju... the brother of wine, the possessor of gray hair, the bald.'\nHe should have said 'Humaydun', so he dropped the Tanwin. Al-Amaj is heat and thirst, and Amaj is a place. Another said:\n'You will find me dutiful to the Emir... and with the spear a thruster, an attacker.\nIf Ghutayf al-Sulami flees.'\nHe should have said: 'Idha Ghutayfun', so he deleted the Tanwin due to the meeting of two sakins. Ubaydullah bin Qais al-Ruqayyat said:\n'How is my sleep on the bed when... a widespread raid has not included Sham.\nDistracting the old man from his sons and revealing... the ankles (Hidham) of the virgin wife.'\nHe intended: And the virgin wife reveals the ankles. Al-Khidam is the anklet, meaning she lifts her dress to flee. The poet said:\n'So I found him not seeking favor... nor remembering Allah (Dhakira Allaha) except a little.'\nDeleting the Tanwin from 'Dhakir' was good, and he put 'Allah' in accusative by it to agree with the conjoined word in indefiniteness. He said:\n'And Hatim al-Ta'i, giver of hundreds (Wahhabu al-mi'iy).'\nIt was obligatory to say 'Wahhabun', so he deleted the Tanwin due to the meeting of two sakins. It was narrated from Abu Amr in some of his paths: (Qul huwa Allahu Ahadu Allahu al-Samad), so he deleted the Tanwin from 'Ahadun' due to the meeting of two sakins. Likewise, the Tanwin was deleted due to the meeting of two sakins in the reading of whoever read: (Wa qalat al-Yahudu: Uzayru Ibnu Allah) considering it a subject and Ibnu Allah its predicate, like the reading of whoever established the Tanwin. Deleting the Tanwin from it is not because of prevention of declension, because Uzayr and its like are declinable whether Arabic or non-Arabic. Rather, deleting the Tanwin was good due to the meeting of two sakins, just as deleting the soft letters was good for that. Do you not see that it ran their course in: 'Lam yaku Zaydun qa'iman', and His Almighty's saying: (Wa in yaku kadhiban fa-'alayhi kadhibuh). The poet established the Nun of 'Mi'atay dirhamin' (two hundred dirhams) by necessity, saying:\n'Indi laha mi'atani thawban mu'lama' (I have for her two hundred marked robes).\nIt is permissible for the Muwallad to delete the Nun of 'Min' if it is followed by a silent Lam, like the saying of the poet:\n'Convey to Abu Dakhtanush a message... other than what might be said from lies (mil kadhib).'\nHe intended to say: 'Min al-kadhib', so he deleted the Nun for its silence and the silence of the Lam after it. Al-Muraqqish al-Akbar said:\n'Nothing grieved my heart from accidents (mil-hawadith)... except my companion left in Taghlam.'\nAnother said:",

    "text": "'As if from now (Mil-ana) they did not change... and an age has passed for the two abodes after us.'\nHe intended: 'Min al-ana' (From now), so he deleted. Likewise, Al-Najashi deleted the Nun from 'Lakin' (But) due to the meeting of two sakins, saying:\n'I am not coming to him nor can I [bear] him... but give me drink (Laki-sqini) if your water possesses excess.'\nThey only deleted this Nun likening it to the Ya' deleted for lightening in 'La adri' (I do not know) and His Almighty's saying: (Dhalika ma kunna nabghi) [That is what we were seeking - without Ya], due to its resemblance to the letters of Madd (prolongation) and Leen (softness). The Rajiz said:\n'Nothing was, O my God, before You (Qablaka).'\nAs for the saying of Al-Mutanabbi:\n'Great, like what is in me, let the torment be (Fal-yaku).'\nWe have mentioned the explanation of this verse in the 'Alawiyya Epistle', and exhausted the sections of defects in it. We only mention here the aspect of ugliness in deleting the Nun from 'Fal-yakun' and the aspect of excuse for him, even if weak. Abu al-Fath said: Deleting the Nun from 'Yakun', which is silent and has resembled the letters of Madd in exit, addition, silence, and Ghunna (nasalization), so it was deleted as they are deleted, while it is strong with movement in 'Fal-yaku al-tabrihu', is not [correct]; he should not have deleted it. End of his speech. The meaning of this saying is that if it were not deleted, its movement would be obligatory due to its silence and the silence of the Ta' substituted for the Lam of definition. It was only deleted in the like of (Wa in yaku kadhiban fa-'alayhi kadhibuh) and in the saying of the Rajiz: 'Lam yaku shay'un ya ilahi qablaka' due to its resemblance to the letters of Madd, Leen, silence, and Ghunna. So they deleted it likening it to the Ya' deleted for lightening in 'La adri' and (Dhalika ma kunna nabghi) and (Yawma ya'ti la takallamu nafsun). If the silence necessitating its resemblance to letters of Madd is removed, its establishment is obligatory, like His Almighty's saying: (Lam yakuni Allahu li-yaghfira lahum). Deleting the Nun from 'Fal-yakun' was ugly from another aspect, which is that he deleted the Nun with Idgham (assimilation), and this is not known, because he who said in Bani al-Harith: 'Balharith', did not say in Bani al-Najjar: 'Bannajjar'. The aspect of excuse for Al-Mutanabbi is to say: As for the correctness of speech, it is establishing the Nun moving, but the necessity of poetry invited him to that. Abu Zaid narrated in 'Al-Nawadir' from the Arabs the like of this necessity in what he recited for Husayl bin Urfuta, saying:\n'The truth was not upon that a trace... of a house effaced at Al-Sarar excited him.\nThe breaches of wind and the flood of rain... changed the newness of its recognition.'\nAl-Najashi deleted the light Nun of 'Lakin' while it was in a place of movement in his saying:\n'Fa-lastu bi-atihi wa la astati'uhu... walahki-sqini in kana ma'uka dha fadli.'\nIf 'Lakin', and its origin is 'Lakinna', allowed necessity to delete its Nun after deleting the other Nun, then deleting the Nun from his saying: 'Fal-yaku al-tabrihu' is tolerated for necessity. As for deleting it with Idgham, we judge that he deleted the Nun from 'Fal-yakun' not for the meeting of two sakins, but rather, as it was deleted in the saying of Al-Qutami:\n'Wa la yaku mawqifun minki al-wada'a' (And let not a stand be farewell from you)\nAnd he introduced the assimilated sakin after deleting it. Similar to it in the ancient Rajaz:\n'Wa man yaku al-dahru lahu bil-marsadi.'\nThis is the aspect of Ijtihad of one trying to apologize for him, and against it is a refutation that invalidates his argument and obliterates his path, and this is not the place to speak of it. The principle is that Abu al-Tayyib erred in that and followed a path not for the Muwallad to follow, and the obligation is to avoid what he followed of this necessity. It is permissible to delete the Ya' from 'Al-Aydi' and 'Al-Nawahi' and from 'Hiya' for necessity. The poet said:\n'A house for Su'da since she (Idh-hi) is of your passion.'\nHe deleted the Ya' from 'Hiya' because he intended: 'Idh hiya min hawaka'. The poet said:\n'And I flew with my blade on working camels... bleeding of hands (Dawami al-Ayd), striking the leather.'\nHe deleted the Ya' from 'Al-Aydi', like the saying of the other:\n'Like the sides (Ka-nawah) of the feathers of a Najdi dove... and you wiped with the gums the dust of antimony.'\nHe dropped the Ya' from 'Nawahi'. Similar is:\n'Your hands: a hand (Kaff) that does not hold a dirham... out of generosity, and another giving (Tu'ti) blood with the sword.'\nHe intends: 'Tu'ti', so he deleted the Ya'. Upon it is the verse of the Book (Sibawayh's):\n'And the brother of beautiful women (Akhu al-ghawan), when he wishes, they cut him off.'\nThe Waw was deleted with Damma, like the saying of the poet:\n'Indeed the poor among us is a judge who ruled... that we reach the water when the stars (Al-nujum) disappear.'\nHe intends 'Al-Nujum', so he deleted the Waw and sufficed with Damma. And his saying:\n'Until when the throats (Halaqim) of the throats (Al-Huluq) were wet.'\nHe intends 'Al-Huluq'. Al-Akhtal said:",

    "text": "'Like the flashing of the hands of bereaved women, robbed... showing the molar of the daughters of Time and calamities (Al-Khutub).'\nHe intends 'Al-Khutub', so he deleted the Waw and sufficed with Damma. It is permissible to silence letters followed by Dammas and Kasras like: 'Adud' and 'Fakhidh', so it is said: 'Ad'd' and 'Fakh'dh'. Al-Akhtal said:\n'You are the best of Quraysh in their lineage... and the people of its valley, the wealthy and the branch (Al-Far'a).'\nHe intended 'Al-Far'a' (branch), so he moved the Ra'. Al-Uqayshir al-Asadi said:\n'We only drink from our wealth... so ask the policeman (Al-Shuratiyya) what is this usurpation (Al-Ghasab)?'\nHe intended 'Al-Shurtiyya' by moving the Ra'. It is said in 'Alima': 'Al'ma', in 'Karuma': 'Kar'ma', in 'Rajul': 'Raj'l', in 'Duriba': 'Dur'b', in 'Usira': 'Us'r'. The poet said:\n'Law 'us'ra minha al-banu wal-misku in'asar' (If the willow and musk were squeezed from her, they would be squeezed).\nIt is said in, for example, 'Intaliq': 'Intal'qa', transferring the movement of the Lam to the Qaf and the silence of the Qaf to the Lam, like the saying of the poet:\n'O how many a born one having no father... and a possessor of a child whom no two parents begot (Yal'dahu).'\nHe moved the Dal with Fatha when he silenced the Lam. As for the saying of the other, which is from the verses of the Book:\n'Qawatinan Makkata min wurqi al-hami' (Dwelling in Mecca of the ash-colored doves).\nAnd it is narrated 'Awalifan'. He intended 'Al-Hamam', so he deleted the Alif, remaining 'Al-Hamam'. Two letters of one genus met, so he substituted the second Mim with Ya' as they said: 'Tazannaytu' substituting Ya' for Nun. This is only permissible to use by necessity in 'Al-Hamam' specifically by transmission (Naql), and it is not permissible to analogize upon it in 'Al-Himar' nor in what resembles that because it is anomalous (Shadh). Among what Alif was deleted in, which is rare in the open (Maftuh) due to the lightness of Alif, is the saying of the poet:\n'Like the sand dune, the downpour of dews (Al-Tilal) compacted it.'\nHe intends 'Al-Tilal', so he deleted the Alif. Abu Uthman said regarding His Almighty's saying: (Ya Abati) [O my father], He intended: 'Ya Abatah', so He deleted the Alif. The poet has doubled what is not permissible to be doubled in other than poetry for necessity. Qa'nab said:\n'Gently, O blamer, you have tested of my character... that I give to people even if they were miserly (Daniffu).'\nThe Rajiz said:\n'Praise be to Allah, the High, the Majestic (Al-Ajlali).'\nThe correct face is 'Dannu' and 'Al-Aliyyu Al-Ajallu'. All these necessities are only permitted for the poet to use in the straits of speech and difficulty of intent, because poetry is the place of committing necessities and using prohibitions. The poet has attached the Nun of plural with the pronoun noun, which is of the necessities not considered good, saying in like 'Al-daribuhu' (those hitting him): 'Al-daribunahu', and 'Al-kha'ifuhu': 'Al-kha'ifunahu', and 'Al-amiruhu': 'Al-amirunahu'. The poet said:\n'They are the sayers of good and its commanders (Al-amirunahu)... when they fear a terrbile matter from a novelty.'\nAs for deleting inflection (I'rab), it is not permissible for the Arab, let alone the Muwallad. The Rajiz said:\n'If they bent, I said: Companion, straighten (Qawwim - silent)... in the desert the likes of the floating ships.'\nSibawayh recited:\n'So today drink (Ashrab - silent) not bearing... a sin from Allah nor an intruder.'\nHe intends: 'Ashrabu', so he deleted the Damma, which is a solecism. The correct narration in it is: 'Fa-al-yawma fa-shrab ghayra mustahqibin'. As for cutting the connecting Alif (Hamzat al-Wasl), it is not permissible for the Muwallad poet to use it because it is a solecism, even if the Arab did that. Jamil said:\n'Indeed I do not see two (Ithnayni) better in character... upon the accidents of time than me and Juml.'\nHe cut the Alif of 'Ithnayn', which is a connecting Alif. It is permissible to add Ya' in what was on the meter of 'Mafa'il' so it becomes 'Fa'il' like 'Masajid' and 'Darahim', so they said: 'Masajid' and 'Darahim'. The reason for that is that if the poet needs to establish the meter, he nullifies the movement and creates from it a letter of its genus. The poet said describing a she-camel:\n'Her hands expel the pebbles in every midday heat... the expelling of dirhams (Darahim) by the critica (Sayarif).'\nLikewise is the saying of Ibn Harma: 'Yamuntazahin', intending 'Bi-muntazahin' from 'Nazh'. And the saying of the other: 'Fanzuru', meaning 'Fanzur'. Grammarians have clarified that and explained it. It came in like 'Al-Miftah': 'Al-Miftah', and in 'Al-Ta'mil': 'Al-Ta'mal', and in 'Al-Kalkal': 'Al-Kalkal'. This is permissible for the Muwallad poet to use if he transmits it by narration because it is the language of the people and they have disposal in it. We do not have analogy upon it, but we use what was narrated from them. The Rajiz said:\n'I say when she fell on the chest (Al-Kalkal)... O my she-camel, what a run you ran.'",

    "text": "It is permissible for the Muwallad poet to use the diminutive in poetry without necessity for meanings in the diminutive which we will mention. Diminutive is of four types: A type for belittling, like your saying: 'Rujayl' (little man). A type for reducing in quantity, like your saying: 'Ujaymal' (few camels). A type for aggrandizing, like the saying of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him: 'Kunayf (little vessel) filled with knowledge.' Hubab said: 'I am its rubbed little stump (Judhayl) and its propped little palm branch (Udhayq).' Labid said:\n'A little calamity (Duwayhiyya) from which fingertips turn yellow.'\nAnd a type for approximation, and that is in adverbs, like your saying: 'Fuwayqa' (a little above) and 'Qudaydima' (a little before). Imru' al-Qais said:\n'Robust, if you approach him from behind, he blocks his gap... with a full tail a little above (Fuwayqa) the ground, not defenseless.'\nAl-A'sha said:\n'Convey to Yazid of Banu Shayban a message... O Abu Thubayt, will you not cease eroding?'\nZuhair said:\n'As for what is a little above (Fuwayqa) the necklace of her... it is of a white doe whose pasture is empty.'\nAbu Zubayd al-Ta'i said:\n'O son of my mother and O little brother (Shuqayyiq) of my soul... you left me for a severe matter.'\nSometimes they used the diminutive for the verb of wonder (Fi'l al-Ta'ajjub) because it attaches to nouns since it lacks conjugation. The meaning of diminishing is exaggeration in appreciation, as he said:\n'Oh how cute (Ya ma uhaysina) are gazelles that appeared to us.'\nIt is permissible to use 'Ghadwan' in place of 'Ghadin', as the poet said:\n'And people are nothing but like dwellings and their people... in them on the day they settled them, and tomorrow (Ghadwan) are empty.'\nIt is permissible to use 'Layti' in place of 'Laytani', as the poet said:\n'Like the wish of Jabir when he said: Would that I (Layti)... encounter him and lose some of my money.'\nIt is permissible to use ''Im sabahan' in place of 'An'im sabahan', as the poet said:\n'They came to my fire, so I said: Who are you?... They said: The Jinn. I said: Have a good evening ('Imu Zalaman).'\nTruncation (Tarkhim) is permissible outside of vocative for necessity, as the poet said:\n'Excellent is the youth you seek the light of his fire... Tarif bin Mali (for Malik) on the night of hunger and cold.'\nHe intends Tarif bin Malik, so he truncated outside of vocative. As the other said:\n'And this my robe is with him, he borrows it... to rob me of my honor, did Mali bin Hanzal (for Malik bin Hanzala).' \nHe intended Hanzala, so he truncated while not being called. As for truncation in vocative, what came of it in their poems cannot be encompassed by counting. The poet said:\n'O Marwa (for Marwan), indeed my mount is detained... hoping for the gift, and its lord has not despaired.'\nHe intends O Marwan. Another said:\n'So you said: Come, O Yazi (for Yazid) bin Mukharram... So I said to you: Indeed I am an ally of Suda'.' \nHe intends O Yazid. Another said:\n'O Hari (for Harith), may I not be struck by a calamity from you.'\nHe intended O Harith. It came from them substituting the moving letter with a letter in which movement does not run. This is of the necessities not permissible for the Muwallad poet, nor is it appreciated. The poet said:\n'He has dried strips of meat he dries... from the foxes (Al-Tha'ali) and a stitch from its hares (Araniha).'\nHe intended 'Al-Tha'alib' so he substituted Ya' for Ba', and likewise intended 'Aranibiha' so he substituted Ya' for Ba'. Similar to it:\n'And a watering place having no restrainers... and for the frogs (Dafadi) of its main body are croaks.'\nHe intends 'Al-Dafadi''. It is permissible for the Muwallad poet to use the past tense in place of the future and the future in place of the past. As for using the past in place of the future, it is like His Almighty's saying: (And the companions of the Fire called out [wa nada - past] to the companions of Paradise: Pour upon us some water). The meaning is: And when the companions of the Fire call out. As for using the future in place of the past, it is like His Almighty's saying: (So a party you denied, and a party you kill [taqtulun - future]). He intended: A party you killed. Similar is (They worship [ya'buduna] nothing but what their fathers worship [ya'budu] before). He placed 'ya'budu' in place of 'abada'. Al-Tirimmah said:\n'And I come to you thanking what has passed... of yesterday and necessitating what was (kana) in tomorrow.'\nHe placed 'kana' in place of 'yakunu'. Ziyad al-A'jam said:\n'And sprinkle the sides of his grave with their blood... for indeed he is (yakunu - future) a brother of blood and sacrifices.'\nHe placed 'yakunu' in place of 'kana'.",

    "text": "Abu al-Fath said: Abu Ali said: I asked Abu Bakr about verbs occurring in place of each other. He said: All verbs should have been one form because they are for one meaning, but their forms were differed due to the difference of the states of their times. If the verb is joined by what indicates it of word or state, it is permissible for some of them to occur in place of others. Abu al-Fath said: This is high, correct speech from Abu Bakr, so know it. A'sha Bahila said:\n'If an enemy afflicts you in hostility... then the highness and victory are (takunu - future) for you.'\nHe placed 'takunu' in place of 'kanat'. Another said:\n'Ju'ada said: What is with your body pale... while it is (yakunu - future) fresh in youth?'\nMeaning: And it was (kana). It is permissible for the Muwallad poet to feminize the masculine and masculinize the feminine based on meaning, and it is more widespread in custom and usage than to need a witness or example. The poet said:\n'Do you abandon a house in Hijaz wrapped... in it fear (Al-Khawf - masc.) and enemies from every side?'\nHe feminized 'Al-Khawf' because he went with it to 'Al-Makhafa' (fear - fem.). Similar is the verse of Al-Hamasa:\n'O rider driving his mount... ask Banu Asad what is this sound (Hadhihi Al-Sawt - fem. dem. for masc. noun)?'\nHe feminized 'Al-Sawt' because he went with it to 'Al-Istighatha' (call for help - fem.). If feminizing the masculine is permissible in their speech based on meaning, which for them is carrying the original on the branch, then masculinizing the feminine is more worthy of permissibility since the origin is masculinity. It is of beautiful goodness to return branches to origins. Of masculinizing the feminine is His Almighty's saying: (The sky is split [Munfatir - masc.] by it). Because He Almighty intended by the sky the ceiling (Al-Saqf - masc.), due to His Almighty's saying: (And We made the sky a preserved ceiling). The poet said:\n'So no cloud poured its rain... nor a land sprouted (Abqala - masc.) its vegetation.'\nHe masculinized when he meant by the land the place (Al-Makan - masc.), except that he returned the Ha' (fem. pronoun) to the word 'Al-Ard'. Zuhair said:\n'It has a tool and helpers who went early for it... a saddle and a bucket when emptied (Ufrigha - masc.) poured out (Insahaqa - masc.).'\n'Ghadawna' is feminine, even if for helpers (A'wan), because he feminized based on the meaning of the group (Jama'a), just as you say: 'Hadhihi Rijal' (These [fem.] are men). The saddle (Qitb) is the saddle of the water-camel, and 'Insahaqa' means poured out. Al-Mufaddal recited:\n'If I were with the defeated, Sayf bin Zalim... I would have attacked so his relatives would have returned the grave of Awf.\nBut I found the arrow easier of notch... upon you, for a blood you seek has perished.'\nHe made the notch (Fuq) feminine; because he intended its peak (Dhirwa - fem.) which is its top. The like of that is many. Among what is permissible for the Muwallad poet to use is deleting the Hamza at necessity. Sibawayh recited for Abdul Rahman bin Hassan:\n'So you were lowlier than a peg in a lowland... whose head is crushed by the rock, driven (Waj - without Hamza).'\nHe intends 'Waji''. Ibn Harma said:\n'Would that the predatory beasts were neighbors to us... and that we see no one of whom we see.\nIndeed the predatory beasts calm down from their prey... and people, their evil is never calming (Hadin).'\nHe intends 'Hadi''. Another said:\n'The scouts threw him until they cast him... behind (Wara) the edge of Sham, the distant lands.'\nHe intended: 'Wara'a', so he shortened the word. He should not have shortened it because the Hamza is original in it. But necessity compelled him, so he turned it into a Ya'. Abu Ali recited:\n'If I do not fight, then clothe me in a veil (Burqu'a).'\nIt is permissible for the Muwallad poet to delete the Hamza of interrogation for necessity with the indication of speech to it, as Al-Kumayt said:\n'I rejoiced, and not for longing for fair women do I rejoice... nor out of play from me; does the gray-haired play (Wa dhu al-shaybi yal'abu)?'\nHe intended: 'A-wa dhu al-shaybi yal'abu' (Or does the gray-haired play?). Imran bin Hittan said:\n'And I became safe among them, not like a group... who came to me and said: From Rabi'a or Mudar?'\nHe intended: 'A-min Rabi'a' (Is it from Rabi'a or Mudar?). Ibn Abi Rabi'a said:\n'Then they said: You love her? I said: Wonderfully... the number of the rain, the pebbles, and the dust.'\nHe intended: 'A-tuhibbuha' (Do you love her?). It was said regarding His Almighty's saying (A favor you confer upon me): The intent is: 'A-wa tilka ni'matun' (Is that a favor?). If that is correct, then necessity is removed from the poetry.",

    "text": "Among what is permissible for the Muwallad poet to use at necessity in his poetry is Kharm, with a dotted Kha' and undotted Ra'. It is the deletion of the first moving letter from the Watid Majmu' (joined peg) at the beginning of the verse. The Watid Majmu' is two moving letters followed by a silent one, like: 'Gha-za', 'Ra-ma'. Kharm does not enter a verse beginning with a Sabab (cord) or Fasilah (separator). It occurs mostly in the first verse of the poem, and may occur in other verses. The poet said:\n'We used to think every white woman a piece of fat... nights we met Judham and Himyar.'\nHe intended to say: 'Wa kunna' (And we were), so he deleted the Waw. Another said:\n'My spear used to not soften for a pincher... so the morning and evening softened it.'\nMost of what is deleted for Kharm are conjunction letters like Waw and its sisters, although Kharm occurs with other than that. Some prosodists permitted Kharm in the beginning of the second half of the verse and likened it to the beginning of the verse, reciting for it the saying of Imru' al-Qais:\n'And an eye for her, round, full... its tear ducts were split from others.'\nHe intended to say: 'Wa shuqqat' (And were split). They recited regarding Kharm at the beginning of the verse and at the beginning of its second half—which is not appreciated and should not be practiced—the saying of the poet:\n'My Lord exchanged for me, instead of Taym al-Lat... Hanzala, who revived Tamim.'\nHe intended to say: 'Wa abdalani' (And exchanged for me) with Hanzala, so he deleted the Waw from the beginning of the first half, and the Ba' from the beginning of the second half. The story of Abu Tammam with Abu Sa'id al-Makfuf, when his Ba'iyya poem praising Abdullah bin Tahir was presented to him, and his denial of the Kharm in the first verse of it, is well known because the scholars of poetry do not appreciate it even if it is permitted and used. It is his saying:\n'They are the misfortunes of Joseph and his companions... so with resolve, for of old the seeker attained revenge.'\nAs for Khazm, with dotted Kha' and dotted Za', it is not permissible for the Muwallad poet to use, nor is its practice ever allowed for him. It is the addition of a word they bring at the beginnings of verses which counts in meaning but does not count in meter. If one wants to scan the verse, that extra word is deleted. It is used in all meters, as the poet said:\n'Tighten your chest belts for death... for indeed death will meet you.'\nThe verse is from Hazaj and does not straighten except by dropping 'Ushdud'. Another said:\n'Al-Musayyab bin Sharik today is a scholar among scholars.'\nIts scansion does not straighten until 'Al-Musayyab' is deleted from its beginning. Khazm might be a letter or two at the beginning of the verse, as Al-Kindi said:\n'And as if Thabir in the foreparts of its rain... is a chief of people in a striped garment wrapped.'\nDo you not see that the meter does not straighten until the Waw falls, and so it is narrated. The origin in the correct narration is the establishment of the Waw, and so the prosodists recited it and argued with it. Khazm has come by way of anomaly in the middle of the verse, like the saying of the poet:\n'O soul, eating and lying down... O soul, you are not immortal.'\nThe verse is from Majzu' al-Kamil, Mutafa'ilun four times, and it is not correct except by dropping 'Ya' from the middle of the verse and sufficing with the vocative particle at the beginning of the verse, so know that. They permitted deleting the Ya' from the rhyme in like the saying of the poet:\n'And a tribe from Lukayz is witnessing... the group of Marjum and the group of Ibn al-Mu'all.'\nHe intends 'Al-Mu'alla'. They also permitted lightening the stressed letter (Mushaddad) in like the saying of the poet:\n'I called my people and I called my clan... until when I found nothing but the evil (Al-Shar).'\n'I was a man from Malik bin Ja'far.'\nHe lightened the Ra' of 'Al-Sharr'. Al-Mubarrad said: He did not intend 'Al-Sharr' (evil), but intended 'Al-Sari' with undotted Sin, which is a man's name likened to 'Al-Sari' which is a river, so he deleted one of the two Yas, remaining 'Al-Sari', then lightened the Ya'. This is a brief overview in this chapter that dispenses with other than it, and a gleam sufficing for what is besides it. For perhaps a firebrand sufficed for a lamp, and a dawn darkness sufficed for a morning.\n\n**Chapter Three**\n**On Its Merit, Benefits, Influence on Hearts, and Occurrences**",

    "text": "As for poetry, it is the register (Diwan) of literature, the pride of the Arabs; by it proverbs are struck, and men boast over men. It is the shackle of virtues and the string of beauties. Were it not for it, the gems of wisdom would be lost, the stars of honor scattered, the buildings of merit demolished, the quarters of glory desolate, the flags of generosity obliterated, and the traces of favors effaced. Its honor is eternal, its sovereignty renewed. Ages perish while its mention remains; mountains fall while its pride ascends to the sky. There is no eraser for what it established, nor blamer for whom it excused. Suhaym, the slave of Banu al-Hashas, died, and he has a mention more fragrant than musk and fresher than myrtle. Were it not for poetry, he would not have been known, nor described with proficiency. How many among the sons of Ham are unknown rabble, neither mentioned nor thanked. It was said: When Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi apologized to Al-Ma'mun—and his speech is known—he said to Al-Ma'mun in response to his saying to him 'You are the Black Caliph': 'As for my being black, the slave of Banu al-Hashas said:\n\"The poems of the slave of Banu al-Hashas stood for him... on the day of boasting, in the place of the origin and the leaves.\nIf I am a slave, my soul is free in generosity... or black of color, indeed I am white of character.\"\nAl-Ma'mun said: 'I would wish they were mine for all my kingdom,' meaning the two verses. Were it not for Zuhair, Harim would not be mentioned, nor would a pen run with his praise. They died and decayed, their limbs torn apart and perished, yet their mention is fresh and new, and their fame remaining and extended; this for his merit and that for his bestowal. Were it not for poetry, they would not be mentioned nor known. Al-Ruhni narrated in his book titled 'Treasures of Wisdom', raising it to Salim bin Abdullah bin Umar from his father Abdullah that he said: We were one day with Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, when he said: Who is the most poetic of people? We said: So-and-so and So-and-so. While we were so, Abdullah bin Abbas appeared, greeted, and he [Umar] sat him by his side, then said: The expert of it has come to you. Who is the most poetic of people, O Ibn Abbas? He said: That is Zuhair bin Abi Sulma. He said: Recite to us something of his poetry by which we can deduce what you say. He said: He praised a people from Ghatafan called Banu Sinan, saying:\n\"If a people were to sit above the sun... a people, by their first or their glory, would have sat.\nA people, Sinan is their father when you trace their lineage... they were good, and good were the children born.\nHumans when secure, Jinn when frightened... generous, noble chiefs when strained.\nEnvied for what was of blessings... Allah does not remove from them what they are envied for.\"\nUmar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: May Allah fight him, O Ibn Abbas! He said good words that were not fitting except for the people of this House from Banu Hashim due to their kinship to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. He considered great what he praised Banu Sinan with, and sought a deserving one for it, but saw none but Banu Hashim. This is Jarir bin al-Khatafa, despite the meanness of his origin, the lowness of his house, the paucity of his family, and the obscurity of his grandfather and father; his poetry raised him and his speech constructed him. So he is immortal, remaining, and he has a protector from annihilation in his poetry. The mention of Yarbu' was built by his mention, and his name became famous among gatherings and groups. He matched Al-Farazdaq and opposed him, openly satirized him and antagonized him, despite Al-Farazdaq's honor and noble origin. Were it not for poetry, he would have been far from competing with his like, until Al-Farazdaq mentioned his fathers and said:\n'Those are my fathers, so bring me their like... when the assemblies gather us, O Jarir.'\nImru' al-Qais and his father, his kingdom and his family have gone. His poetry and speech remained, and his saying and system were populated. How many a king in Kinda went, and his equipment and gear went with him, so his news is not sensed, nor his name or mark known. The kingdom of the Tubba's and Chosroes has gone, and the authority of the qayls and Asawira has vanished, and nothing remained for them except a current verse from the praise of a poet. Were it not for the praises of Ziyad al-Dhubyani, King Ibn al-Julah would not have been known, nor would the fragrance of praise diffused for him. Likewise his father Al-Julah; were it not for Abu Umama, there would be no sign of mention upon him:\n'Al-Julah died, but did not die... what Abu Umama said about him.'\nThe Arabs used to consider poetry grave, and see the poet as a prince. If a poet appeared in the tribe, they were congratulated for him, and envied because of him, because he defends their lineages, and fights and struggles for their honors.",

    "text": "'How many a prince was in Aws... they all died except 'Araba.\nA verse of a poet revived him after death... when he called, he rewarded him.\nPerhaps he was in the tail... but poetry returned him to the forelock.'\nDo you not see Abu Dulaf al-Ijli, how [poetry] raised him, despite the lowness of his house and the baseness of Banu Ijl, for you find no praised one among them but him, [due to] the saying of Ibn Jabala:\n'The world is only Abu Dulaf... between his desert and his settled land.\nIf Abu Dulaf turns away... the world turns away on his trace.'\nAbu al-Saqr bin Bulbul was not counted among those of established roots, nor growing branches, until Ibn Jurayj praised him saying:\n'They said Abu al-Saqr is from Shayban. I said to them... Nay, by my life, but Shayban is from him.\nHow many a father rose by a son to peaks of honor... as Adnan rose by the Messenger of Allah.\nI did not fall short with Shayban, by whom... roots and branches reached the utmost.'\nSo he became among the elite of the praised, and exemplars use his praise as a proverb. Banu Quray' used to be called 'Anf al-Naqa' (Camel's Nose) and they would get angry at that and resent it. When Al-Hutay'ah praised them saying:\n'A people who are the Nose, and others are the tails... and who equates the tail with the Camel's Nose?'\nThey became pleased with it and it became one of their greatest boasts. Were it not for poetry, they would have counted it among their ugliest titles. The story of Al-Hutay'ah with Al-Zibraqan bin Badr, and what happened from his wife Umm Shadhra and her shortcoming in his right, and the correspondence of Banu Anf al-Naqa with him until they corrupted him [against Al-Zibraqan] and moved him to them, is famous and mentioned. When Al-Hutay'ah was given the choice, he chose Banu Anf al-Naqa over Al-Zibraqan. That was hard on him. Al-Zibraqan sent to a man from Al-Namir bin Qasit called Dithar bin Shayban and ordered him to satirize them. The Namari said from verses:\n'And you came to the waters of Banu Quray'... so you did not join ties of kinship since you did evil.'\nAt that, Al-Hutay'ah needed to satirize Al-Zibraqan bin Badr, so he satirized him with verses including:\n'Leave noble deeds, do not rise to seek them... and sit, for you are the fed, the clothed.'\nWhen it reached Al-Zibraqan, he complained about him to Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: He satirized me. When he asked him to recite, Umar said: There is no harm in that. He said: Send to Hassan bin Thabit and ask him did he satirize me or not. Hassan said: Yes, he satirized him and defecated on him. So Umar imprisoned him. Al-Hutay'ah wrote to him from prison verses including:\n'What do you say to chicks at Dhi Marakh... red of crops, with neither water nor trees?\nYou threw their earner into the bottom of a dark place... so bestow favor upon him, may Allah guide you, O Umar.'\nThe poetry affected Umar, so he asked him to repent and released him. If Al-Hutay'ah had insulted Al-Zibraqan without poetry, he would not have been affected by his insult. Since it was poetry, he saw that by saying 'You are the fed, the clothed', he had committed a crime against him and offended him. When Al-Hutay'ah satirized Banu al-Ajlan, they complained about him to Umar bin al-Khattab and said: He satirized us and defamed our honors. Umar said: And what did he say? They said: He said about us:\n'If Allah were to be an enemy to people of meanness and pettiness... He would be an enemy to Banu al-Ajlan, the group of Ibn Muqbil.'\nUmar said: He invoked against them. They said he said:\n'A little tribe who do not betray a covenant... nor wrong people a grain of mustard.'\nUmar said: These are righteous people, would that I were of them and the family of Al-Khattab were of them. They said he said:\n'And they do not approach water except in the evening... when the drinkers return from every watering place.'\nUmar said: That is lighter for crowding, and then the water clears and the approach is pleasant. They said he said:\n'And Al-Ajlan was named so only because of their saying... Take the cup and milk, O slave, and hurry (i'jal).'\nUmar said: The master of the people is their servant, and the smallest of them is their knife. They said he said:\n'The trained dogs disdain their flesh... and eat from Ka'b bin Awf and Nahshal.'\nUmar said: Sufficient waste is he whose flesh dogs eat. They said: O Commander of the Faithful, this is not your craft, so if you sent to Hassan bin Thabit and asked him. He sent to Hassan and asked him: Did he satirize them? He said: No, O Commander of the Faithful, but he defecated on them.",

    "text": "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, threatened whoever memorized the poem of Al-Afwah al-Awdi and guaranteed him the Fire, out of disdain for satire and anger at the positions of his arrows. He, peace be upon him, heard a man reciting:\n'Quraysh was an egg so it split... so the yolk, its pure part, belongs to Abd al-Dar.'\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, got angry and said to Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him: Is this how the poet said? He said: No, O Messenger of Allah, rather he said:\n'O man shifting his saddle... why did you not dismount at the family of Abd Manaf?\nThe strikers of the ram whose helmet shines... and the sayers: Come, to the guests.\nThe mixers of their poor with their rich... until their poor returns like the sufficient.\nAmr of the Heights (Al-Ula) crumbled tharid for his people... while the men of Mecca were drought-stricken, lean.\nQuraysh was an egg so it split... so the yolk, its pure part, belongs to Abd Manaf.'\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, rejoiced until the lines of his face shone and said: Thus he said. It reached him, peace be upon him, that Ka'b bin Zuhair satirized him, so he vowed his blood. He came to him disguised until he entered the mosque and asked his permission to present his praise. He permitted him, so he stood before him and recited:\n'Su'ad departed, so my heart today is lovesick... enslaved after her, unransomed, shackled.'\nWhen he reached his saying:\n'I was informed that the Messenger of Allah threatened me... and pardon with the Messenger of Allah is hoped.'\nHe said: Allah has pardoned you. He bestowed his mantle (Burda) upon him, comforted him, and secured him. Were it not for his poetry, his blood would have been shed and his destination would have been Hell. Abu Ya'la al-Ashdaq narrated, saying: I heard Al-Nabigha say: I recited to the Prophet, peace be upon him:\n'We reached the sky, our glory and our ancestors... and we hope for an ascent above that.'\nHe got angry and said: Where is the ascent, O Abu Layla? I said: Paradise, O Messenger of Allah. He said: Yes, if Allah Almighty wills, and smiled. I said:\n'And there is no good in clemency if it does not have... impulses that protect its purity from being muddied.\nAnd there is no good in ignorance if it does not have... a forbearing one who, when the people arrive, issues [them out].'\nThe Prophet, peace be upon him, said: You did well, may Allah Almighty not break your mouth, twice. He lived more than a hundred years and was among the people with the best teeth. Abu Ghaziyya al-Ansari narrated, saying: When Hassan bin Thabit recited to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, his poem until he reached his saying:\n'I satirized Muhammad, so I answered on his behalf... and with Allah in that is the reward.'\nHe, peace be upon him, smiled and said to him: May Allah reward you with Paradise for that. Then he recited to him:\n'For my father and his father and my honor... are a shield from you for the honor of Muhammad.'\nHe, peace be upon him, said: May Allah shield you from the heat of the Fire. Hisham bin Urwa narrated, saying: My father told me, saying: Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, told me, saying: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was sitting mending a sandal and I was sitting spinning. I began looking at the side of his neck and his cheek had sweated. His sweat began generating light, so I was stunned. He raised his head and looked at me and said: O Aisha, at what are you looking, you are stunned? I said: I do not look at anything of you except light generates in my eye. By Allah, if Abu Kabir al-Hudhali saw you, he would know that you are more worthy of his poetry than anyone else. She said: He said: And what did Abu Kabir say? I said: He said:\n'And acquitted of every remnant of menstruation... and corruption of a wet nurse and a disease causing death.\nAnd if you look at the lines of his face... they shine like the flash of the rejoicing cloud.'\nShe said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, put down what was in his hand and came to me, kissed between my eyes, and said: May Allah reward you with good, O Aisha. I do not remember when I was pleased as I am pleased with your words. Hisham bin Urwa narrated that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ordered Abdullah bin Rawaha to improvise poetry, so he said from verses:\n'You are the Prophet, and whoever is deprived of his intercession... on the Day of Reckoning, fate has disgraced him.\nSo may Allah establish what He gave you of goodness... the establishment of Moses, and a victory like they were given victory.'",

    "text": "He, peace be upon him, said: And you, may Allah establish you, O Ibn Rawaha. The narrator of this hadith said: So Allah established him with the best establishment, he was killed as a martyr, and passed away happy. Umar bin Hizzan bin Sa'id al-Ruhawi narrated from his father that a man from his people called Amr bin Subay' came as a delegate to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and recited to him:\n'To you, O Messenger of Allah, I worked its pace... traversing the deserts, plain after plain.\nUpon a possessor of planks (camel), whenever I want the night journey... she trots with my saddle at times and then gallops.\nSo you have no rest with me or you stay (talahlahi)... at the door of the Hashimi Prophet, the successful.\nI was safe then from journey after journey... and cutting deserts and a clear night.'\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, rejoiced at his poetry and tied a banner for him. Talahlahi: Originally talahhahi from ilhah (persistence), so they substituted Lam for the assimilated Ha out of dislike for the gathering of Has. When the delegation of Hawazin came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, at Al-Ji'ranah, Abu Jarwal al-Jushami recited to him a poem including:\n'Bestow upon us, O Messenger of Allah, in generosity... for you are the man we hope for and store.\nBestow upon an egg (tribe/women) whose releasing is a destiny... tearing its unity; in its time are changes.'\nWhen he heard his poetry, he sympathized with them and returned their sons and women to them. The hadith is famous. When the Prophet, peace be upon him, killed Al-Nadr bin al-Harith, his daughter Qutayla began saying from verses:\n'O Muhammad, and indeed you are the son of a noble woman... in her people, and the stallion is a rooted stallion.\nWhat would it have harmed you if you had bestowed favor? And perhaps... the youth bestows favor while he is enraged, angry.'\nWhen he, peace be upon him, heard her poetry, he said—and he does not speak from desire—: If I had heard it before killing him, I would not have killed him. Al-Abbas bin Mirdas al-Sulami praised him, peace be upon him, with verses including:\n'I saw you, O best of all creation... you spread a book that came with the truth, marked.\nYou legislated for us the religion of guidance after our deviation... from the truth when the truth became dark.\nSo who will convey from me to the Prophet Muhammad... and every man will be rewarded for what he advanced.\nYou established the path of truth after its crookedness... and of old its pillar had been demolished.'\nHe bestowed his robe upon him, and cut his tongue [silenced his demands] by his kindness to him. Were it not for poetry, the kindness from the Prophet would not have included him. The Prophet, peace be upon him, heard poetry from a group other than these, turning with listening to them, and inclining with appreciation towards them. Among them are A'sha of Banu Mazin, Dirar bin al-Azwar, and Qirda bin Nufatha al-Saluli. Among what he heard from him:\n'Youth departed and I did not care for it... and gray hair and Islam approached, an approach.\nSo praise be to Allah, since my term did not come to me... until I clothed myself from Islam with a garment.'\nHe, peace be upon him, said: Praise be to Allah. He heard from Abdullah bin Kurz al-Laythi, from Humayd bin Thawr, from Al-Namir bin Tawlab al-Ukli, from Labid bin Rabi'a, from Farwa bin Amir al-Judhami, and from Amr bin Salim al-Ka'bi. When Maymun bin Qais al-A'sha intended him and praised him, Abu Jahl met him and said: Where is your intent, O Abu Basir? He said: Muhammad the Messenger of Allah. He said: And have you said anything about him? He said: Yes, and recited to him:\n'Did your eyes not close on the night of ophthalmia... and you spent the night as the snake-bitten spends the night sleepless?'\nUntil he reached his saying:\n'And I swore I would not pity it for its fatigue... nor for unshodness until it visits Muhammad.\nWhenever you kneel at the door of Ibn Hashim... you rest and meet from his favors a hand.\nA Prophet who sees what you do not see, and his mention... has raided, by my life, in the lands and went to the highlands.'\nAbu Jahl envied him for Al-A'sha's praise, so he said to him: O Abu Basir, he forbids wine for you. He did not cease with him until he turned him away from him. Al-A'sha said: I will come to him next year. But he died, and death stood between the wish.",

    "text": "People complained to him of drought, so he prayed for rain for them and they were watered. When it was the second Friday, a man came running and said: O Messenger of Allah, houses have collapsed and walls have fallen. He, peace be upon him, smiled laughing at his saying, and said: Which of you narrates the word of my uncle Abu Talib? Abu Bakr stood up and said: I, O Messenger of Allah. He said: Recite. So he recited to him:\n'You lied, by the House of Allah, that Muhammad be overcome... while we have not struggled around him and fought.'\nWhen he reached his saying:\n'And a white one, by whose face the clouds are asked for rain... aid of the orphans, protection for the widows.'\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, rejoiced and his face beamed. When Hisham bin al-Walid bin al-Mughira killed Abu Uzayhir al-Dawsi at Dhu al-Majaz, and there was haste in Hisham, the people gathered and prepared for fighting. Abu Sufyan came and said: How fast are people to the blood of this clan of Quraysh! He said to his companions: Do not busy yourselves with war among you from the war of Muhammad, meaning the Prophet, peace be upon him. The Messenger of Allah said to Hassan bin Thabit: Incite Abu Sufyan regarding the blood of Abu Uzayhir. Hassan said from verses:\n'Hisham bin al-Walid clothed you his robes... so wear out and succeed the likes of them new ones after.\nHe fulfilled a wish from him so he became noble... and you became slack, neither trotting nor going early.\nSo the farting donkey did not defend his protection... nor did Hind prevent the disgrace of her father.\nIf only old men at Badr had witnessed... a fresh roses [blood] would have wet the sandals of the people.'\nHe, peace be upon him, only wanted Abu Sufyan to become zealous and for poetry to shake him according to the custom of the Arabs, so he would be busy with the war of Banu Makhzum from his war. Disagreement would occur between them, so his affair, peace be upon him, would strengthen and they would weaken from him according to the custom of the Arabs in protective jealousy (Hamiyya). Do you not see that Jassas bin Murra killed Kulayb Wa'il unaware because of the she-camel of his aunt's neighbor due to verses she said, which are:\n'By the life of my father, if I were in the house of Minqar... Sa'd would not have been wronged while he is the neighbor of my houses.\nBut I became in a house of estrangement... whenever the wolf raids in it, he raids my sheep.\nSo O Sa'd, let not my people deceive you, and depart... for you are among a tribe who are dead regarding the neighbor.\nAnd take my camels and drive them, for I... am fearful that they will betray my little daughters.'\nWhen Jassas heard the verses, they moved him, shook him, and angered him. He said: Quiet, O old woman, for I will surely kill for the she-camel of your neighbor the greatest stallion of the Arabs. She thought he would kill some of Kulayb's camels. He went out immediately, stabbed Kulayb and killed him. But Abu Sufyan, when he heard Hassan's verses, being cunning, left the war of Makhzum fearing what the Prophet, peace be upon him, calculated and attempted. Safiyya bint Abd al-Muttalib said, urging Abu Sufyan to take revenge for Abu Uzayhir from Banu Makhzum, and alluding to him about the fire that was lit for him due to treachery. That is because the Arabs used to, if a man betrayed, light a fire for him on a mountain and say: This is the treachery of So-and-so. When Abu Uzayhir, who was Abu Sufyan's son-in-law, was killed and he did not take revenge for him, fire was lit on Abu Qubays during the season and it was said: This is the treachery of Abu Sufyan. They are verses including:\n'Verily convey a message to my cousins... so why is the plot among us and the command?\nAnd ask in the crowds of Banu Ali... when reciting and boasting increases.'\nShe means Banu Ali bin Bakr bin Kinana. From it:\n'And we are the forgivers when we are capable... and in us upon our anger is victory.\nWe did not begin disobedience to a possessor of womb... nor was a fire lit for us due to treachery.'\nThat did not move him because of what was in his soul of the war of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. It was narrated that Muawiyah said to Urwa bin al-Zubayr: Do you recite the saying of your grandmother Safiyya:\n'I contended the eternities of times over you... and Asma' did not feel that she is a widow.\nIf he were a polytheist philanderer, I would have excused him... but people claim he is a Muslim.'",

    "text": "Muawiyah only wanted to provoke Urwa with that. Urwa said: Yes, and I recite her saying: 'Verily convey a message to my cousins...' the verses. Muawiyah was ashamed until his forehead sweated at the mention of his father's treachery and the fire that was lit for him on Abu Qubays. When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, died and the Arabs apostatized, Al-Hutay'ah was the greatest motive for their apostasy by his saying:\n'We obeyed the Messenger of Allah as long as he was among us... so O wonder, what is the matter with the rule of Abu Bakr?\nWill he bequeath it to Bakr if he dies after him... then that, by Allah's life, is the breaker of the back.'\nThe Arabs became zealous at Al-Hutay'ah's saying and disdained obeying Abu Bakr. From the influence of poetry is that Ibn Hisham bin al-Walid had appointed Abdul Rahman bin Hazm al-Ansari over Medina. Al-Ahwas said:\n'Do not have mercy on a Hazmi you pass by... one day, even if the Hazmi is thrown into the Fire.\nThe breakers [of allegiance] against Marwan at Dhi Khushub... and those entering upon Uthman in the house.'\nWhen Hisham heard Al-Ahwas's poetry, he removed Abdul Rahman from Medina and ordered the seizure of their estates and money. When Al-Mansur took power, some of the children of Banu Hazm entered upon him and said: O Commander of the Faithful, for sixty years we have not taken a grant nor reached anything of our money because of Al-Ahwas's saying. He recited the two verses to him. He was affected by them and said: Then, by Allah, the outcome is praised with Banu Hashim. Write to return their estates and seize the estates of Banu Umayya and hand them over to them to exploit for sixty years. Then he ordered ten thousand dinars for him as a gift. Sudayf entered upon Al-Saffah while Banu Umayya were with him in their ranks. He recited to him:\n'Let not what you see of people deceive you... indeed under the ribs is a festering disease.\nSo put down the sword and raise the whip until... you do not see upon its back an Umayyad.'\nSudayf also recited to him:\n'The kingdom has become firm of foundations... by the masters from Banu al-Abbas.'\nUntil he reached his saying:\n'And remember the death of Al-Husayn and Zaid... and a slain one beside Al-Mihras.'\nAl-Saffah was affected by that, an effect that appeared on the pages of his face, and it was a cause for killing Banu Umayya, along with what was in the soul against them: 'And speech does what needles do not do.' He ordered striking their necks to the last of them, and their story is famous. Al-Mada'ini narrated that Al-Mansur said: I accompanied a blind man to Sham, and he wanted Marwan bin Muhammad for a poem he said about him. Al-Mansur said: I asked him to recite the poetry to me, but he refused and said: Only he whom it was said about hears it. I kept being gentle and friendly with him until he recited it to me. From it:\n'I wish I knew, did the scent of musk diffuse... and I do not think there is a human at Al-Khayf.\nWhen Banu Umayya were absent from it... and the masters from Banu Abd Shams.\nOrators on the pulpits, knights... upon them, and speakers not mute.\nThey are not faulted speaking, and if they... spoke, they hit the mark and did not speak with confusion.\nWith dreams (forbearance) when dreams are lightened... and faces like smooth dinars.'\nAl-Mansur said: By Allah, he did not finish his poetry until I thought blindness had overtaken me, and by Allah, I envied Marwan for the poetry more than I envied him for the Caliphate. When the matter devolved to me, I went out for Hajj in the year one hundred forty-one. I got down from the litter at the two mountains of Zarud walking in the sand for a vow I had. Suddenly I saw the blind man. I signaled to those with me, so they stepped back. I approached him, took his hand, and greeted him. He said: Who are you? May I be your ransom, I do not confirm you as an acquaintance. I said: I am your companion to Sham in the days of Banu Umayya while you were heading to Marwan bin Muhammad al-Ja'di. He greeted me, sighed deeply, and recited:\n'The women of Banu Umayya became widows from them... and their daughters in a lost place are orphans.\nTheir lucks slept and their star was dropped... and the star drops and lucks sleep.\nThe pulpits and beds are empty of them... so upon them until death is peace.'",

    "text": "Al-Mansur said: I said to him: How much did Marwan give you? He said: He enriched me with the richness of eternity, so I ask no one after him. He said: I intended to kill him, then I remembered the right of trust and the sanctity of companionship, so I released him. Then it appeared to me [to seize him] so I ordered his pursuit, but it was as if the desert annihilated him. It was narrated that Yazid bin Ruwaym al-Shaybani, who was a man who lost things (Misya'), rested his camels one night from the pasture upon his father. His father said to him: Did you not give them supper? He said: Yes, I did. His father pushed his garment in the faces of the camels, startled them, and turned them to the pasture, saying: Improve their supper. The boy said: Indeed I reckon other than you will spend the night as their owner. When he reached the place where he gives supper to his camels, Sirhan bin Arta'ah al-Sa'di passed by him in a small group of horsemen. He drove the camels and took the boy, tying him firmly to some of those camels. The boy raised his voice and recited:\n'O woe to a mother I have, noble to me... my loss to her is a grief of griefs.\nIndeed, he whom you hope for the benefit of his return... supper fell with him upon a wolf (Sirhan).\nSupper fell with him upon a moon-hunter (Mutaqammir)... firm of heart, accustomed to stabbing.'\nWhen Sirhan bin Arta'ah heard his poetry, he said to him: Are you a poet? He said: Yes. He said: Let him go. So he released him and returned his camels to him. Their saying in the proverb: 'Supper fell with him upon Sirhan'. It was said: Sirhan here is the wolf. A group said: Rather it is Sirhan bin Mu'attab al-Ghanawi. He had raided the camels of Nusayha al-Asadi, so his brother Huzayla bin Mu'attab said:\n'Convey to Nusayha that the herder of his camels... supper fell with him upon Sirhan.\nSupper fell with him upon a moon-hunter... whom fear of accidents did not dissuade.'\nThe correct narration is what we mentioned first. Were it not for poetry and the poet, the soul and camels would have gone. Al-Mufaddal al-Dabbi said: I was beside Ibrahim bin Abdullah bin Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, on the day of his meeting Al-Mansur's army. He turned to me and said: O Mufaddal, recite something to me. I said: He wants from me what I can move him with. So I recited to him the verses of Uwayf al-Fazari:\n'I say to noble youths who went in the evening... on short-haired horses, in their mouths are bits.\nStand a stand, he who lives will not be disgraced after it... and he who is cut off, blames will not follow him.\nAnd you did not distance yourself from them... to be safe from it; the last of time is safe.'\nHe said: O Mufaddal, repeat. I repeated three times. He stretched in his stirrups until I said they broke, and charged time after time, killing in each one a soul and ten, until he charged and did not return. It was said: A stray arrow came to him and slaughtered him. Shurahbil bin Ma'n bin Za'ida narrated, saying: I was on the road to Mecca, riding under the dome of Yahya bin Khalid, and his counterpart was Abu Yusuf the Judge. A man approached on a noble camel and recited poetry that Yahya did not approve of. He said to him: Did I not forbid you from saying the like of it? Why did you not say as the poet said:\n'Banu Matar on the day of meeting are as if they... are lions having cubs in the thicket of Khaffan.\nTall chiefs in Islam, they ruled and there was not... for their first in Jahiliyya a first.\nThey protect the neighbor until it is as if... their neighbor has a home between the two Simak stars.\nThey are the people, if they speak they hit the mark, and if called... they answer, and if they give they make good and abundant.\nThree, their tolerances are like mountains... and their dreams are heavier than them in panic.\nAnd doers cannot do their deed... even if they do good in calamities and act beautifully.'\nAbu Yusuf said to Yahya: To Allah is the goodness of its sayer! Whose poetry is this? Yahya said: To Marwan bin Abi Hafsa regarding the father of this youth, and he glanced at me. Abu Yusuf turned to me and said: Who are you, O youth? I said: Shurahbil bin Ma'n bin Za'ida. Shurahbil said: By Allah, I do not know a joy entered my heart greater than my joy at that, nor did a happier hour pass me than that hour. It was said when the saying of Al-A'sha reached Alqama:\n'You spend the night in winter with your bellies full... and your neighbor women are hungry, spending the night with empty bellies.'",

    "text": "He wept, and perhaps he did not weep at the descending of calamities and striking of misfortunes, even if he witnessed death in wars and the confrontation of heroes in distress. It was said: Al-Mansur passed by the grave of Al-Walid bin Uqba bin Abi Mu'ayt, so he cursed him frequently and said: He is the first who ignited the war between Banu Abd Manaf with his saying:\n'Banu Hashim, return the weapons of your sister's son... and do not loot him, his loots are not lawful.\nBanu Hashim, how is peace between us... while Ali has his armor and his she-camels?\nThey killed him so they could be in his place... as her Marzbans (satraps) once betrayed Khosrow.'\nMuawiyah was not one to talk to himself about opposing Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, nor intend to dispute him nor approach him in boasting, until this one wrote to him, and he pointed with his hand to the grave of Al-Walid bin Uqba, saying:\n'Verily convey to Muawiyah bin Harb... for you are from a trustworthy brother, blaming.\nYou spent time like the suffering old camel... braying in Damascus and not leaving.\nAnd indeed you, in writing to Ali... are like a tanner while the leather has rotted.\nIf you were the killed one and he was alive... he would have tucked up, neither heavy nor weary.'\nSo he shook him with this poetry and moved him, and agitated him with it and incited him, until he tucked up his leg (prepared for war), and declared after his hypocrisy. This is the end of Al-Mansur's speech. A group of the Shia narrated that Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, was not demanded of Uthman's blood, despite his innocence of it, and his saying: 'By Allah, I did not kill Uthman nor colluded in his killing,' except by the incitement of Hassan bin Thabit and his saying:\n'Would that I knew, and would that the birds inform me... what was between Ali and Ibn Affan.\nYou will surely hear soon in their lands... Allah is Great, O revenges of Uthman.'\nIt was said: The cause of Ibn al-Ash'ath's rebellion against Abdul Malik bin Marwan was the poet's saying:\n'Is it in Allah [justice] that Bahdal and the son of Bahdal... lives, while the son of Al-Zubayr is killed?'\nHe said: No, by Allah. And he sought the blood of the family of Al-Zubayr, and from him was what was. Among the curious things I came across regarding the influence of poetry is what some Sheikhs told me, raising it to Ya'la bin Muhammad al-A'raj. The narrator from him said: He told us by dictation from his memory on Wednesday, the fourteenth of Dhu al-Qa'dah in the year four hundred and forty-five, he said: When Al-Walid bin Tarif al-Shari al-Shaybani rebelled and wreaked havoc in the regions of Iraq, the people of Baghdad spread rumors about him, and people talked much. He had no equal to repel his crack and block his breach except his cousin, Yazid bin Mazyad al-Shaybani, his father's brother's son without separation. The Vizier of the Caliphate summoned him and recited to him according to the custom of the Arabs, inciting him and seeking victory through him. What he recited to him was:\n'If you are called, you are not called for an easy thing... but for a dilemma that exceeds dilemmas.\nIndeed the Caliphate is anchored to a mountain... and you and your son are the corners of that mountain.\nBoast, for you have no like in Shayban... likewise Banu Shayban have no like.'\nThe Vizier began a speech encouraging him in it, and promising him what would be in its folds. Yazid said to him: Stop, O our master, for you have sufficed and been sufficed. He rose, evil having moved him and joy shook him, dragging his trails. He emerged with his group immediately to fight Al-Walid. He met him, and the chase occurred, and dust rose. Allah granted him victory over Al-Walid and he killed him, after Al-Walid was charging at the horses and turning their necks to their rears, raising his voice and calling:\n'I am Al-Walid bin Tarif al-Shari... a lion (Qaswara), my fire is not warmed by.\nYour injustice drove me out of my house.'\nWhen he fell to the ground, his sister rode, put on her armor, and went out challenging to fight. Yazid, the killer of her brother and her cousin, looked at her and called to her: O Hanah (O you), throw the spear from your hand and return to your tent. You have exposed the free women; this is not a place for women. She planted her spear in the ground, leaned her head on it, and wept. She recited elegizing her brother:\n'If it was Yazid bin Mazyad who destroyed him... then many a crawling [army] is afflicted by a crawling [army].\nO tree of Khabur, why are you leafy... as if you do not grieve for Ibn Tarif?\nWe lost him, the loss of spring, so would that we... ransomed him from our elite with thousands.'",

    "text": "'A youth who does not count provision except from piety... nor wealth except from spears and swords.\nNor horses except every short-haired, lean mare... and every stallion, tyrannical with forelegs.'\nThen she returned to her tent wailing and mourning her brother with her women. I say: To Allah is the goodness of three verses that carried the man to kill his cousin and cut his kinship ties. Had the speech in the poetry been prose, it would not have shaken him, nor carried him to take his spoil, nor killed his cousin and robbed him. Allah pardons the sinners. Yahya bin Khalid said: A man from Banu Umayya asked me to convey him to Al-Rashid. I said to him: The Commander of the Faithful is deviated from every affiliate to Umayya, and his rage against them and his bad belief in them is famous. If you have a need other than this, I will fulfill it for you. He refused except being conveyed to him. I informed Al-Rashid of his request and my answer to him. He ordered him to be brought. I did not doubt he would end the evening killed. When he stood before him, he recited:\n'O Trust of Allah, I am saying... the saying of a possessor of intellect, religion, and manners.\nYou have merit over us, and we have... by you merit over all Arabs.\nAbd Shams was following Hashim... and they are after that from a mother and a father.\nSo connect the wombs from us, for... Abd Shams is the uncle of Abd al-Muttalib.'\nAl-Rashid said to him: You spoke the truth, affected by his saying, and the poetry had worked in his soul. He ordered forty thousand dirhams for him. Yahya said: Were it not for the verses, he would have ordered taking his head. Marwan bin Abi Hafsa narrated, saying: I went out wanting Ma'n bin Za'ida. The road joined me with a Bedouin. I said to him: Where do you want? He said: This Shaybani king. I said: What have you gifted him? He said: Two verses. I said: Only! He said: I have gathered in them what pleases him. I said: Bring them. He recited to me:\n'Ma'n bin Za'ida, by whom was increased... honor upon honor the Banu Shayban.\nIf the days of deeds are counted, then only... his two days are a day of generosity and a day of stabbing.'\nHe said: And I had a poem I wove on this meter. I said: O you, you come to a man whose entourage has multiplied and poets at his door have multiplied. When will you reach him? He said: So say. I said: You take from me some of what you hoped for with these two verses and return to your saddle. He said: How much do you offer? I said: Fifty dirhams. He said: I would not do it, nor for double. He said: I kept being gentle with him until I offered him one hundred and twenty dirhams. He took them and left. I said: I will be truthful with you. He said: And truthfulness is better for you. I said: I wove a poem balancing this poetry and I want to add these two verses to it. He said: Glory be to Allah, I knew and you feared a matter that will never reach you. So I came to Ma'n bin Za'ida and put the two verses in the middle of the poem and recited it to him. He listened towards me. By Allah, it was only that I reached the two verses and he heard them that he could not control himself but fell from his bedding until he stuck to the ground, then said: Repeat the two verses. I repeated them. He called out: O boy, bring me a bag with a thousand dinars. It was only his word and his bag. He said: Pour it on his head. Then he said: Bring twenty garments from my special clothing, and my beast Such and my mule Such. So I left with the gift of the Bedouin, not the gift of Ma'n. When Abu Tammam al-Ta'i praised Ahmad son of Al-Mu'tasim with his poem beginning:\n'There is no harm in your standing for an hour... fulfilling the obligation of the effaced quarters.'\nWhen he reached his saying:\n'The daring of Amr, in the generosity of Hatim... in the clemency of Ahnaf, in the intelligence of Iyas.'\nOne of those present, Ya'qub al-Kindi, said to him: How do you liken the son of the Commander of the Faithful to crude Bedouins while he is nobler in status and greater in position? He was cut off and looked down, then raised his head and recited improvising:\n'Do not deny my striking for him those below him... as a parable wandering in generosity and might.\nFor Allah has struck the lesser for His Light... as a parable from the niche and the lamp.'\nHe shook with joy for that, and was stunned by it in wonder, and signed for him a governorship in Mosul.",

    "text": "Sharaf al-Dawla Muslim bin Quraysh gifted Mosul to one of his poets and departed from it. It was said to the poet that it would not remain yours, so if you sold it to the Emir's deputies, you would be successful. They bought it from him for twenty thousand dinars. When Sharaf al-Dawla heard of this, he said: Bring him to me. He grabbed his ear and said: Did you receive the money? He said: Yes. He said: And you are satisfied? He said: Yes, by Allah. Then he rubbed his ear and said to him: O cuckold (dayyuth), you sold it cheap. Why did you not hold your hand (insist) and demand one hundred thousand dinars? For they would have had no choice but to pay the money to you. This story is how my father, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated it to me, but he did not mention the poetry nor the poet. He, may Allah have mercy on him, said: My mother's uncle, Muhammad bin Ubaydullah al-Alawi al-Husayni, told me this. He said: Al-Muhadhdhab Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Mushir the Scribe told me this in the months of the year five hundred and thirty-one. Ibn Mushir used to praise the Banu Muslim bin Quraysh and serve them. He narrated to me that Abu al-Qasim al-Hasan bin Hani' al-Maghribi al-Andalusi was a poet for the Banu Marwan in Andalusia. When Al-Mu'izz al-Alawi heard his poetry, he sent for him and brought him to him, desiring literature and competing for the honor of ranks. When he joined his service, he praised him with eulogies, including:\n'Love is where the company are enemies.'\nAnd from them:\n'Advance a step and retreat a step.'\nAnd from them:\n'I say statues, and they are the beautiful, soft women.'\nAnd from them:\n'Did he perfume the wind with ambergris?'\nAnd from them:\n'He traveled by night while the wing of the night was black, dark.'\nAnd from them:\n'Did she visit us at night while the stars were stationary?'\nAnd from them:\n'Al-Muhassab became desolate of a guide and of Hayd (camel driver?).'\nAnd from them:\n'Are they pearls, the tears of this cloud, or drops?'\nAnd from them:\n'These mounts traveled with me and hastened.'\nAnd from them:\n'They stood in a funeral gathering over the lovers.'\nAnd from them:\n'Is it your scent or a smear of sticking musk?'\nAnd from them:\n'We passed by those dwellings of yours.'\nAnd from them:\n'Do you think wine in the north wind is cool wind (Shamul)?'\nAnd from them:\n'A wide day in boasting, long.'\nAnd from them:\n'She stood swaying as a stream pushed.'\nAnd from them:\n'She listened and said: The footfall of a short-haired, tall horse.'\nAnd from them:\n'She gave me to drink what the mouths of snakes ejected.'\nAnd from them:\n'Are there from the canyons of Alij, Yabrin?'\nWhenever he praised him with a poem, he gave him an estate. When his slave Jawhar went out and took Egypt, Al-Mu'izz went out. When he sat for congratulations, Ibn Hani' entered upon him and asked his permission to recite. He permitted him, so he recited a poem from which he says:\n'Indeed, the days are your days which... for you is half of their blessings and for us the half.'\nHe turned to his minister and said: Write for him Alexandria and hand it over to him with whoever is in it, for it is a half we have allocated to him. Thus were the prizes of poets. Al-Ahwas was given twenty thousand dinars for his saying:\n'My money was not new gain from trade... nor was it inheritance of money inherited.\nBut a gift from a blessed Imam... who filled the earth with kindness, generosity, and sovereignty.'\nThese are famous verses, and I do not think any of the shortcomings of the poets of the time are incapable of saying the like of them. Zuhair had reached the utmost in praising Harim bin Sinan bin Haritha until the Arabs struck the proverb with Harim in generosity because of Zuhair's saying:\n'Indeed the miser is blamed wherever he is, but... the generous one, despite his defects, is Harim.\nHe is the generous one who gives you his gift... easily, and is wronged sometimes, so he bears injustice.'\nThe people of knowledge of poetry agreed that the most praising thing the Arabs said is Zuhair's saying:\n'The seekers of good from Harim have made... and the askers, to his doors, roads.\nIf you meet Harim one day despite his conditions... you meet tolerance from him and generosity as a character.'\nHarim was excessive in his giving and spending on him until Harim swore that he would not greet Zuhair unless he gave him money and camels. So Zuhair stopped greeting Harim, sparing him and out of shame for his excessive giving. Zuhair used to pass by the assembly and say: 'Good morning to you, except Harim, and your best I left.' Thus poets used to be ashamed of the gifts of the praised and the benevolence of the benefactors, as Al-Ma'arri said:",

    "text": "'If you shortened the benevolence, I would visit you... for sweet water is abandoned for excessive coldness.'\nWhen Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Muhammad al-Tihami entered upon Hassan bin Jarrah al-Ta'i, the ruler of Sham, he recited to him his poem which begins:\n'Is passion anything but that her tents appear... so their protection decrees the offering of peace?'\nWhen he reached his saying:\n'Indeed Tayy is a Kaaba for noble deeds... and Hassan is of it its corner and station (Maqam).\nThe lands are little for you as a kingdom, and their people... as slaves, so is its Sham considered much for you?'\nHe gifted him the city of Hama and its districts. From the effect of poetry on proud souls is that Al-Zahir in Egypt had removed Abu al-Qasim Ibn al-Maghribi from his ministry. He separated from the Egyptian lands and connected with the lands of Mayyafariqin. After Al-Maghribi, he appointed Ali bin Ahmad al-Jarjara'i as minister. Al-Maghribi used to continue [sending] gifts and kindnesses to Al-Tihami until he came to him and praised him with a poem beginning:\n'My heart is a ransom for it, from domes... circling on the mirage like bubbles.'\nThen he said in it:\n'So who will convey to Egypt a saying that generalizes... and specifies the turbaned King?\nYou were a pearl in his crown... so the claw was substituted in its place.\nIf his place is blocked, it is not blocked... and if the like of it is substituted, it is not substituted.\nWhen the lion is estranged from his thicket... the sheep becomes in it licking the grass.\nI came to you praising for affection... and I did not come praising for property.'\nHis saying reached Al-Jarjara'i, so he did not cease employing tricks until Al-Tihami came to Egypt, so he imprisoned him and his imprisonment was long. He has many poems he said in his prison regretting his coming and apologizing for the slip of his composition. From that:\n'Blame yourself, no excuse, the excuse has run out... with this the Destined ruled when the matter was decreed.'\nHe says in it:\n'I committed a crime against myself by my striving to them... and I have no excuse from their most faithful covenants.\nI have no sin except poetry, for I... indeed know that the sin in my calamity is poetry.\nA captive with people without a crime... indeed, in the way of Allah is what the matter (command) did.'\nHe has from another:\n'O he whom the tongue of poetry announced his death... and like aloeswood he spreads from his scent.\nIt is hard on Time what you are in... even if what is with you of its vicissitudes is great.\nAnd the saying of one who persisted in his violence doubled my passion... when I was imprisoned.\nHe says—and some speech of the fool... kills if he does not hide it—\nIs this Al-Tihami from Mecca... striving with his feet to his death?\nDid it not suffice him that the robe of life... was ample on him, did it not suffice him?\nHe wanted to fly the flight of kings... and thought the spearheads were of his feathers.\nIs it with poetry, woe to you, you seek loftiness... while you fall short of its construction?\nAnd you were not worthy to settle... on the pulpit of the kingdom or its edge.\nBecause you are rarer (less) than a poet... despite the baseness of poetry in his description.\nYou shed blood you long protected... and ignited ember and did not extinguish it.\nAnd you were on the brink waiting for ruin... while your chest is hot, you did not heal it.\nWhen the wood dries of its water... that is more inviting to its breaking.'\nWhen his imprisonment prolonged, Al-Jarjara'i signaled to his boy Labib to kill him in his prison. So Labib entered upon him at night and strangled him. Were it not for poetry, he would not have been affected by it an effect that carried him to kill a soul and eternal abode in the fire of Hell.",

    "text": "Ibn Nasr, the ruler of Aleppo, did not cease corresponding with Ibn Hayyus al-Dimashqi, connecting him with gifts, grants, and kindnesses until he brought him to him and had him visit. When he approached Aleppo, he went out in his procession and received him, honored him, greeted him, and lodged him in his guest house. After days, he sat in the Citadel of Aleppo a public sitting and permitted his deputies, emirs, companions, and ministers. When people settled in their ranks, he summoned him and seated him before him. He recited to him his poem which he says in its beginning:\n'Stop in hate where you ended blaming... and do not follow one who was unjust when he ruled.'\nHe called for a bag containing a thousand dinars and poured it on him, so the attendees picked it up. Then he called for another bag containing a thousand dinars, twenty garments, a splendid robe of honor, and a horse with a gold collar and gold bridle (Sirfasar), and gave it to him and wrote for him an estate from the mothers of villages in Aleppo. These were the prizes of poets. Fakhr al-Mulk Abu Ghalib bin Khalaf al-Wasiti, when he entered Baghdad during the days of his vizierates for Baha' al-Dawla bin Adud al-Dawla, strove for Ibn Nubata al-Sa'di to praise him, but he did not do so and said to him: 'Ahmad bin Ishaq—meaning Al-Qadir Billah—forbade me from praising anyone but him.' When his speech reached Al-Qadir, and that he did not express him as Imam or Commander of the Faithful, nor increased upon naming him and attributing him, he tolerated that from him despite his refusal, given what he had of competition and strictness in the like of it. Then Fakhr al-Mulk reached out to Al-Qadir and approached him with types of closeness, and asked him to permit Ibn Nubata to praise him. He apologized to him and refused him, saying: 'It was not for the poet of the Caliphate to praise other than it.' When the desire became difficult for Fakhr al-Mulk, he set Ibn Hajib al-Nu'man who forged upon Ibn Nubata and said: 'The Commander of the Faithful has prescribed for you to praise the Vizier Fakhr al-Mulk.' So he attended complying with the command. When Fakhr al-Mulk saw him, he stood up for him, raised his seat, improved his prize, and gave him of clothes and gold what no poet like him was given. Look at the competition of this Vizier in earning praise, his trickery to obtain commendation from the literati, and the might of that with the Imam Caliphs, may Allah be pleased with them. Thus were the desires of the chiefs in the literati. My father, may Allah be pleased with him, told me, saying: Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Ubaydullah al-Alawi al-Husayni told me, saying: Abu al-Mafakhir al-Abhari told me, saying: Abu Ya'la Ibn al-Habbaria al-Hashimi told me, saying: Abu Sa'd al-Ala' bin al-Hasan bin Mawsilaya, the scribe of the Caliphate's presence, told me, saying: When I wrote a letter on behalf of Ra'is al-Ru'asa', I was cautious, guarded, and diligent, and I hardly escaped his criticism, his taking and rejecting. But I have become such that when I write a letter on behalf of Ibn Jahir, I let myself go in it and do not observe anything of its words and meanings. When I present it to him, he takes it and weighs it with his hand. If he finds it heavy and large, he says: 'O my son, may Allah bless you, this is a good letter in which you honored and magnified him.' And if he finds its size small, and deems its lines and writing little, he looks at me askance and says: 'Perhaps you are not pleased, or is this for lack of whiteness (paper)?' Ibn al-Habbaria recited for himself:\n'So say to a Vizier whose criticism of his letter... is by its papers in weight and counting its lines.\nPerhaps a time whose Vizier we complained of... returns to us today the like of its Vizier.'\nLook how much is between Fakhr al-Mulk and his ambition, and between Ibn Jahir and his commonness and craft. Bishr bin Abi Khazim al-Asadi had satirized Aws bin Haritha the King unjustly; Banu Badr al-Fazaris incited him to satirize him. Then Bishr raided Tayy' in a cavalry of his people. He raided Banu Nabhan and was wounded and weakened while he was that day protecting his companions. Banu Nabhan captured him and hid him, disliking that his news reach Aws. Aws heard that he was with them, so he corresponded with them to hand him over to him, but they hid him. He swore to take him, and they feared he would kill him. When they refused, he gave them two hundred camels, so they handed him over to his messengers. Some of them said to him while he was tied on a camel: 'O Bishr, sing to us,' for people had already sung about what Aws would do to you. While they were threatening him, he scolded the birds and wild animals (took omens) and saw what he liked, so he said:\n'Do you not see the birds next to the livestock... and the caravan and the herd in the valley of Salam?\nSafety and a blessing from the blessings.'\nOne of the messengers answered:",

    "text": "'Indeed you, O Bishr, are possessor of illusion and concern... in your scolding the birds upon the trace of regret.\nRejoice in a falling like the downpour of drizzle... and cutting of your hands, and it will be doubled with the foot.\nAnd with the tongue after it and with the nose... indeed Ibn Su'da is possessor of punishment and vengeance.'\nWhen they brought him, Aws said to him: 'You satirized me unjustly. So choose between cutting your tongue and imprisoning you in a burrow until you die, or cutting your hands and feet and releasing your way.' Then he entered upon his mother Su'da, and she had heard his speech. She said to him: 'O my son, your father died and I hoped you for your people generally, and I have become—by Allah—not hoping you for yourself specifically. Woe to you! Did you claim that you are cutting a poet man? And when were poets treated with other than kindness? If you claimed that he satirized you, then who will erase what he said about you?' He said: 'So what should I do with him?' She said: 'You clothe him in your robe, carry him on your mount, and order one hundred she-camels for him; perhaps he will wash his satire with his praise.' He went out from her, released his way, treated him well, and did multiples of what his mother ordered him. So Bishr praised him abundantly, and washed away the filth and dirt from him. Al-Akhfash said: Bishr praised Aws and his family with a poem in place of every poem he satirized them with. He had satirized them with five, so he praised them with five. Of that is his chosen poem:\n'Suffice with the distance from Asma' a sufficient... and there is no cure for her love as it prolonged.'\nThe matter was as his mother said, for Bishr erased his blame with his praise. In this chapter, from the effect of poetry and the roars of angry lions, there is much that causes wondrous wonder. In what we have presented is sufficiency for those of intellect.\n\n**Chapter Four**\n**On Revealing What It Was Praised For and Blamed Because Of**\n**And Whether Engaging in It Is More Reforming, or Rejecting It Is More Abundant and Weightier**\n\nAs for the praise of poetry on the tongue of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the tongues of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, it is abundant and plentiful. None denies that except one inexperienced, poor in literature. In following them and tracking their method is guidance whose traveler does not stray, a cradle whose owner is not displaced, a fire-stick whose striker does not fail, and a supply whose drawer is not exhausted. From that is his saying, peace be upon him: '...from poetry is surely wisdom', and in another place: 'Indeed from poetry is surely wisdoms.' This is his saying, and he, peace be upon him, does not speak from desire, after Allah Almighty said regarding David, peace be upon him: 'And We gave him wisdom and decisive speech.' And He Almighty said: 'And Lot, We gave him judgment and knowledge.' So he, peace be upon him, made some poetry a part of wisdom with which Allah Almighty singled out His prophets and described His chosen ones. He bestowed it upon them as He made them singled out with it from Him, and immersed in its pride from His side. That is sufficient for you as a virtue for poetry and poets, and a merit by which the status of literature and literati became great. And he, peace be upon him, said to Hassan bin Thabit: 'You are Hassan and your tongue is Husam (a sharp sword).' This speech is from the chapter of Aspiring Paronomasia. Were it not for poetry, he would not have made his tongue a Husam metaphorically, for its penetration in speech and the fear of its biting words, just as the Husam penetrates in the struck object and its edges are feared at calamity. He, peace be upon him, also said to Hassan: 'Answer on my behalf; O Allah, support him with the Holy Spirit.' Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, placed a pulpit for Hassan in the mosque to defend him with poetry upon it. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, says: 'Indeed Allah Almighty supports Hassan with the Holy Spirit.' And he said to him: 'Satirize them,' or he said: 'Mock them and Gabriel is with you.' Aisha narrated that she heard the Messenger of Allah, upon him be blessings and peace, saying to Hassan: 'Indeed the Holy Spirit does not cease to support you as long as you defend Allah Almighty and His Messenger, upon him be peace.' Ibn Abi Buraydah narrated in what he attributed, saying: Gabriel, peace be upon him, aided Hassan bin Thabit in his praise of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, with seventy verses; and there is a look (doubt) in it. In other than a report, he, peace be upon him, said to Hassan: 'Stir the chiefs against Banu Abd Manaf; by Allah, your poetry is harder on them than the falling of arrows in the darkness of night.'",

    "text": "It was narrated that when Quraysh satirized the Ansar, they came to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and asked his permission to satirize them. He permitted them. They came to Ka'b bin Malik, who was a describer of war. He made a poem. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to them: 'He did nothing.' They came to Abdullah bin Rawaha, who was a describer of Paradise. He said a poem, and they brought it to the Prophet, peace be upon him. He said: 'He did nothing.' They came to Hassan bin Thabit. He said: 'I was not to do it until the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, orders me.' Hassan was the most knowledgeable of people about the satire of Quraysh in Jahiliyya. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to him: 'O Hassan, Abu Sufyan has satirized me, and his kinship to me is what you know. So how will you do?' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I will surely extract you from him as a hair is extracted from dough.' He said to him: 'Do you have poetry, O Hassan?' He stuck out his tongue, and behold it was like the tail of a snake. He said to him: 'Go, for Gabriel is with you.' Among what Hassan satirized Abu Sufyan with was his saying:\n'And you are attached, attached in the family of Hashim... as the single cup is attached behind the rider.'\nHe, peace be upon him, said: 'I ordered Abdullah bin Rawaha, and he spoke and did well. I ordered Ka'b bin Malik, and he spoke and did well. And I ordered Hassan bin Thabit, so he healed and was healed.' Abdullah bin Abbas said: 'Learn poetry, for it is the first knowledge of the Arabs and it is the register (Diwan) of literature. And stick to the poetry of the people of Hijaz, for it is the poetry of Jahiliyya and it has been pardoned.' Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'Memorize poems and read news (history), for poetry calls to noble morals, teaches beautiful deeds, incites to beautiful actions, opens up acumen, sharpens the mind, urges the building of virtues and storing of nobilities, forbids base morals, deters from falling into suspicions, and encourages the meanings of ranks.' Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'Teach your children poetry, for it teaches them noble morals.' Al-Rashid advised Al-Kisa'i regarding Al-Amin and Al-Ma'mun, and among his advice was: 'And quench them with poetry, for it is the most fulfilling literature that urges to high ranks.' Muawiyah said: 'Teach your children poetry, for I attained the Caliphate, gained leadership, and reached this status through the verses of Ibn al-Itnaba. For on the Day of al-Harir, whenever I resolved to flee, I recited his saying:\n\"My chastity refused for me, and my trial refused... and my taking praise for a profitable price.\nAnd my saying whenever it (soul) heaved and agitated... in your place, you will be praised or you will rest.\"\nSo I stood firm and said: In your place, you will be protected or you will rest.' When Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf came to Iraq, he shunned poets with a shunning whose news reached Abdul Malik bin Marwan. He wrote to him: 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. From Abdullah Abdul Malik to Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf. As for what follows: A matter about you has reached me that belied my physiognomy in you and disappointed my opinion of you, which is your turning away from poetry and poets. For you do not know the virtue of poetry nor do you know the places of poets' speech and the impacts of their arrows. Do you not know, O brother of Thaqif, that by poetry is the permanence of mention and the growth of pride? And that poets are the embroidery of the kingdom, the ornaments of the state, the titles of blessing, the amulets of glory, and the proofs of generosity? And that they urge to beautiful actions and forbid blameworthy characters? And that they established the path of nobilities for its seekers and guided the seekers of praises to its doors? And that kindness to them is generosity, and turning away from them is meanness and regret? So rectify the excess of your negligence, and erase with your correctness the suggestion of your errors.'",

    "text": "From the virtue of poetry is that scholars of literature cannot compose a single verse of it, given the lack of nature in composing it and the gift from Allah Almighty in compiling it, due to His Almighty's saying: (And We did not teach him poetry, nor is it befitting for him). He attributed teaching it to Himself, Glory be to Him, and made it among His gifts to the creature and His adornment with which He clothes whom He wills, as He Almighty said: (He increases in creation what He wills). Were it not that this merit, and the sublime virtue, is a gift from Allah Almighty, it would not have been difficult for scholars despite their knowledge of its tools and their grasp of the reins of its instruments, and easy for one empty of literature, and lean in the pastures of that slope, so that he says what he does not know its reasoning, and composes what he is ignorant of its branches and roots. From the virtue of poetry is that prose speech, even if its brocade pleases and its splendor is delicate, its words are beautiful, and its sources are sweet, if the camel-driver recites it, and the singer brings it, and the entertainer extends his voice with it, and the reciter raises his voice with it, it does not move a grave person, nor console a sad one, nor reveal an ambush from hearts, nor betray a trustworthy tear. But if it is transformed itself into verse, and marked with meter a mark, it enters ears without hindrance, and possesses hearts as bondmaids are possessed in wars, and grips limbs like splints grip wounds. How many a soul regained itself by it, and how many a lifeblood it took and snatched, and how many a noble it revived and a mean one it destroyed, and how many a poor one it enriched, and how many a rich one it emptied. A virtue that belongs only to it forever. Poetry is a mine of preference and inimitability; it encourages the cowardly weak, so he has no flight nor recoil. The miser gives generously even if weary, and the old man acts youthfully even if aged. Its miracles are apparent, and its signs are coming and going. As for he who went to blaming it and diminishing it due to his bad understanding, he is only holding onto doubts he did not know their interpretation, relying on arguments he did not know their reasoning, stumbling in a dark night blindly, involved in wading a painful rugged path. That which the blamer held onto is his saying, peace be upon him: (That the belly of one of you be filled with pus until it consumes him is better for him than to be filled with poetry). Pus (Qayh): pus not mixed with blood. Yarihi: from Wary, and the noun is Wara with movement (vowel), and from it is the supplication: May Allah Almighty inflict Wara and the fever of Khaybar on him. It is said 'Wara al-qayh jawfahu yarihi waryan' if it ate it. Abd bin al-Hashas said:\n'My Lord caused them Wary (consumed them) like what they caused me... and heated the cauteries upon their livers.'\nThis is a hadith that testifies for itself that he, peace be upon him, intended by it a specific time, and singled out specific people with it, and did not permit it absolutely. The proof of that is what he praised poetry with and aggrandized it because of, and the fact that he, peace be upon him, heard poetry in Rajaz and Qasid, asked for it to be recited, quoted it broken in meter, and in a narration: correct in meter, and ordered buying it by satirizing whoever satirized him, and urged it and called for it. He has famous poets from the Ansar and others. Not one of his Companions remained but said poetry, little or much, recited and asked for recitation, quoted it and argued with it, wrote and corresponded. If it is established that it is for specific people, and invalidated that it is for generality and absoluteness, interpreting it would be a form of affectation. There is no harm in mentioning some of what scholars interpreted it with. From that is what Al-Kalbi narrated from Abu Salih from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, peace be upon him, he said: (That the belly of one of you be filled with pus until it consumes him is better for him than to be filled with poetry with which I was satirized). And in the hadith of Aisha, may Allah Almighty be pleased with her, regarding the mutual satire of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. We said: This hadith is not authentic for several reasons: Among them: That Al-Kalbi has been criticized by the scholars of Hadith, and his saying is not trusted by them. Among them is that memorizing a single verse of what the Prophet, peace be upon him, was satirized with, its pus consumes and its ugliness does not hide, let alone the belly being filled with it.",

    "text": "And among them is that if he intended by it the satire of his noble self, he would have declared the disbelief of the one uttering it, let alone the one memorizing it filling his belly with it; for there is no disagreement among Muslims that whoever insults the Messenger of Allah has disbelieved, and insulting is part of satire. Since that is invalid, the intended meaning is blaming one whose habit is memorizing soft poems and subtle satires until that distracts him from knowing what is obligatory upon him of his religious affairs and reforming his worldly life. It was said: He only meant the poets of the enemies of Allah and enemies of His Messenger who satirized and defamed the honors of his Companions, and elegized the killed polytheists at Badr and elsewhere, eulogizing them and mentioning their virtue. Since memorizing that is of the base impurities, he, peace be upon him, countered it with pus which the soul loathes and nature flees from, exaggerating in its filthiness. Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, said: What is disliked of poetry is only satire and the soft (erotic) in which women are courted, so the hearts of youths are stirred by it. As for other than that, how beneficial it is. Al-Nadr said: How can our bellies be filled—meaning with poetry—while in them are the Quran, Fiqh, Hadith, and other things? This was only in Jahiliyya, but today, no. The blamer of poetry and poets held onto His Almighty's saying: (And the poets - [only] the deviators follow them. Do you not see that in every valley they roam? And that they say what they do not do?). The answer to that is that the one holding onto that argued with has no knowledge of the meanings of the Glorious Quran, for this verse is specific to the poets of Jahiliyya. It was narrated from Ikrimah that he said: The meaning of this verse is that two poets engaged in mutual satire in Jahiliyya, and with each one of them was a group of people following him, memorizing from him what he invented. It was narrated from Al-Hasan regarding His Almighty's saying: (Do you not see that in every valley they roam) that he said: We have seen their valleys in which they used to roam, sometimes in praise and sometimes in satire. It was narrated from Ibn Mujahid that he said: They roam in every art they master of the arts of poetry. It was said regarding His Almighty's saying: (And that they say what they do not do), meaning they claim against themselves that they killed while they did not kill, and fornicated while they did not do, and similar things... The sayings of the commentators on that are numerous and famous, and there is no dispute regarding the restriction of the verse to the poets of Jahiliyya such that we expand speech on that. Then from the ignorance of the one arguing against poets with this verse is his not knowing whom was excepted in it, reciting its beginning and forgetting its end, which is His Almighty's saying: (Except those who believe and do righteous deeds and remember Allah much and defend themselves after they were wronged). Those who believe are the Mukhadramun who were in Jahiliyya and Islam reached them, so their faith was good. Then He Almighty described them with doing righteous deeds when they answered the Caller of the Messenger and followed his straight Sunnah and stopped at his commands and prohibitions. He praised them for remembering Allah Almighty much, and mentioned their weighty dreams (forbearance) by His saying: (And defend themselves after they were wronged). For when Quraysh satirized them and provoked them, and started them with harm and angered them, they asked permission of the Messenger, peace be upon him, so he permitted them to take revenge on them. How did he leave mentioning these and what Allah Almighty described them with, and argue with the mention of the poets of Jahiliyya, were it not for deviation from the truth and bewilderment in those paths.",

    "text": "The blamer of poetry and poets held onto the saying of who said: Poetry is the vilest food eaten, the most obscene craft practiced, the filthiest arrow touched, and the cheapest garment worn, because the saying of its poet is falsehood, his praise is deception, his wording is immorality, and he is heavy, abandoned. If he is far, his harm is feared, and if he is near, his injury is not safe. The utmost a poet does when he runs in his field, unleashes the rein of his tongue, stretches in speech with his effort, armors himself in description with his seriousness, celebrates reaching his goal with whom he begs, and throws himself to the furthest of his desire with whom he frequents and seeks, is to differentiate in describing a camel, prolong in questioning a ruin, weep over an effaced trace, stand and ask to stand on stirred ashes, saddle the she-camels and he-camels, describe crossing deserts and traversing sands, mention arriving at brackish waters, and accompanying ghouls and demonesses in those road-mouths. What mind is less, and opinion more unjust and astray, than the mind of a man who sets himself up to hear that, and the opinion of a poet who tired himself and exhausted his sense in describing cows and asking stones? Then, if the poet composes a piece, and snatches a meaning, he belittles the first generation of poets, and despises Al-Khalil and Al-Mufaddal among scholars. He has nothing but gleams he took from the bellies of books and misread from the texts of pages. He did not graduate to knowing literature by long companionship nor old practice. If companionship is not long, the place [of knowledge] is not known. Knowledge has a secret; whoever falls short of its place is not counted among its brethren. How many a poet, he who bestowed favor upon him and treated him well was afflicted by him, so he countered benevolence with offense, favor with revenge, and good deed with ugly waste, until he made him taste after the sweetness of his praises the bitterness of his satire, and made him swallow the chokings of his defamation and the sting of his blame, breaking what he concluded, demolishing what he built, and belying himself in what he presented. No disdain turns him away from it, no shame deters him, no religion curbs him, and no piety restrains him. How many a noble of both sides, high of grandparents, pure of lineage, sound of ancestry, great of ranks, noble of mother and father, has he slandered with satire: base in his lineage, mean in claiming a father other than his father, low in his worth, contemptible in his affair. How many a free, noble, chaste, trustworthy, veiled, protected woman has satire torn her veil, and uncovered her cover, so shame encompassed her, and disgrace befell her; she cannot bear defense for that nor find prevention from it. What calamity is greater and tragedy more painful than a poet shooting the sanctity of a benefactor to him with his slander, and branding the side of a favor-giver to him with his defamation, so the shame of his satire sticks to him like the ring of the dove, until the Day of Judgment. The poet is only honored out of fear of his evil, and caution of his foul tongue, lack of religion, and absence of chivalry. He, peace be upon him, said: (The worst of people is he who is honored out of fear of his evil). Whenever a poet recites to you a satire with which he tore the honor of a Muslim, or presents to you an insult with which he slandered the sanctity of an innocent submissive one, he only intended by that to show you his venom, make you taste his poisons, teach you how he notches his arrows, frighten you with his brand, and warn you of his cautery. How many a generous one poetry made miserly, a pure-blooded one in his people it left an intruder, a brave one it made cowardly, and a trustworthy one it left treacherous. Do you not see Abu Nuwas and the kindness of Banu Barmak to him, his approach with praises to them, and their approach with gifts to him? Among his sayings about them:\n'Peace be upon the world if there are not in it... Banu Barmak among goers and comers.'\nPeople generally knew the fame of Banu Barmak for generosity and their specialization in giving what is available. Abu Nuwas was not ashamed of their kindness to him and people's belying him until he branded them with miserliness, and called them stingy, violating the consensus about them, and denying their favor to him, until he said among his satire of them:\n'Banu Barmak, of meanness and miserliness you are... worthy, but it might be said: Impossible.'\nHe satirized Ja'far:\n'If other than miserliness came from Ja'far... they would not have brought him down from it except for stupidity.\nI see Ja'far increasing in meanness and pettiness... when the Merciful increases him in the ample provision.'\nLikewise Abu Nuwas did with Al-Khasib. After his saying about him:",

    "text": "'If our mounts do not visit the land of Al-Khasib... then which youth after Al-Khasib will they visit?'\nHe says:\n'Al-Khasib's bread is hung by the star... protected by every straightened and lined [spear/sword].'\nThis is Abu al-Tayyib [Al-Mutanabbi] who came to Kafur al-Ikhshidi seeking gifts, and arrived to him showering him with praise and eulogy. From his saying about him:\n'Intenders of Kafur, leavers of other than him... and whoever intends the sea belittles the streams.'\nWhen Kafur continued his gifts to him and was excessive in giving his money and grants to him, he turned back on him with blame, blowing into the mouth of his honor the killers of his poison. He, peace be upon him, said: (It is forbidden for the malicious soul to leave the abode of the world until it does evil to one who did good to it). When Abu al-Tayyib was asked about the reason for his blaming Kafur, he claimed that he prevented him from seeking kings, and spilling the water of his face before the rich and the poor, and guaranteed him compensation for what ambitions imagined in that purpose. He could not argue with a shortcoming issued from Kafur. So is this a sin for which he deserved that he say after that praise in him:\n'Who taught the castrated black man a noble deed... his white people or his noble fathers?'\nIf we counted those of the poets who did that, and those of them who countered kindness with blame and satire, we would write books on that, and cite from it curious wonders. This is the cream of one who churned his skin bag in blaming poetry and poets, and casting it and them away in estrangement in the open. We will mention the answer to that briefly, Allah Almighty willing.\n\n**The Answer, and with Allah is success:**\nKnow, O blamer—may Allah Almighty reform you—that the truth is other than what you aimed for, and sincerity is other than what you fraternized. Whoever disputes in a matter and does not appeal to a judge other than himself, will not attain the proof of his arguments and the uncovering of his confusion. Whoever Satan beautified for him a matter in his seclusions so he was pleased with it, and his desire lured him for a purpose so ignorance led him to it, ceased not to be in a place of error from the truth and dark confusion in those paths. Self-admiration with opinion is the bane of the intellect, and hearts with desires are quick to turn; especially if they do not have a leader of insight from fairness, nor a helper of support from guidance. And they did not have for their crookedness a straightener or corrector, nor in their ignorance a guide or teacher. Whoever is pleased with something hates its opposite, argues for his falsehood with his effort, resents what opposes him, denies of it what he knew, is a builder for what was demolished of it, a binder for what strayed of its beauties, and deviating, turning away from what appeared of its evils. What you are upon is not of justice, nor is what you went to of fairness. Knowledge is other than what you imagined, and literature is not as you claimed. Indeed, knowledge is of impregnable sanctuary, difficult ascent, not attained by wishes, nor reached by ease. None will enjoy it except he who loved it for itself and its preciousness, sought it for its essence and pleasure, and loved it for its eye and merit. It was his companion in loneliness, his second in solitude; he multiplies with it in paucity, and finds glory with it in the state of humiliation. It will not give you part of it until you give it your all, and it will not accompany you until you throw yourself upon it. Perhaps with that, its aim is difficult for you, its attainment far from your hand. Do you not see it when he who is not of it entered it, and was satisfied with its name without its eye and body, how its splendor went, its luster sank, its freshness changed, its sunan were suspended, its path obliterated, its worth belittled, its matter disdained, its traces cast away, its quarters became desolate, its conditions broken, innovations introduced in it, and abominations appeared in it? Like the saying of the first:\n'When people claimed knowledge equal... like cattle loaded with books.\nIts cheerfulness sank and its bearer became angry... and the garden withered from it and was clothed in shame.'",

    "text": "You must, O blamer, know that poetry is speech, and in speech is the good and the bad, what earns reward and what brings punishment, what Paradises are bought with and what Fires are purchased with. So how can blame be launched on all, and the high be taken with the low, and dislike specific to some be attached to all poetry? He, peace be upon him, said: (Poetry is speech; its good is like good speech, and its ugly is like ugly speech). Know that poets are humans, and among humans are the righteous and the wicked, the wise and the ignorant, the praised and the blamed. It is not of reason and justice that we find in a man a blameworthy trait so we blame because of it everyone named by his name, and everyone attributed to his origin and root, and everyone entering his craft, and everyone counted in his group. Is it proper for the wise intelligent one to see a scribe making solecisms, bad in handwriting, mistaken in his vowels and dots, so he blames for his sake every scribe, and distances for hatred of him every record keeper and accountant? Is the doer of that counted among the legally responsible? No, by Allah, nor in the group of the achievers. Likewise, every craft, if one excels in it and does well, not all its people deserve praise; just as if one falls short in it and errs, blame is not attached to all its people. Rather, it is of justice and fairness, and the traits of the noble and honorable, that everything be given its share, and every possessor of a portion be fulfilled his right. So praise is attached to its owners and blame to its companions, as He, Glory be to Him and Exalted, said regarding who deserves praise: (Excellent is the servant, indeed he was repeatedly turning back [to Allah]). And He Almighty said regarding who deserves blame: (Cruel, after all that, base-born). A human should not be dragged with his desire to an end that throws him into his destruction. Know, O blamer, that poetry is a rare, noble craft whose mention is immortalized for the eternity of time, and its pride remains for the duration of eternity. Whoever did not run in the field of composition, and did not excel in the bet of skill and understanding, and the exercise of poetry did not train his nature, and the dissonance of rhymes did not rub his mind the rubbing of leather, and meanings refuse him the refusal of the difficult unruly [camel], and sweet fresh words are difficult for him the difficulty of the slow exhausted [camel], and returning the stray [meanings] of his intentions is hard for him, and exiting from the set pattern and limited bound to other varieties of descriptions and similes is impossible for him, did not know the realities of poetry and the subtleties of meanings, and did not know whether its sayer deserves praise or blame, unless he is an imitator not a critic. As for the Arabs' description of dwellings and traces, their standing at ruins and remains, and likening women to gazelles and wild cows, to other descriptions of road-mouths and ravines, dozing and night travel, they are excused in that, not blamed, because they ran in it on the sunan of the predecessors and the custom of those who advanced among them. They did not describe, characterize, liken, praise, and blame except what was in front of their eyes; they do not see other than it, nor suffer other than it. For every people there is a sunnah by which they guide themselves, and a way upon which they hover and to which they aim. Whoever lost that among them was outside his doctrine, opposing his nature, falling from behind his limit. Just as the Muwallad among poets, if he leaves the descriptions of straight statures, beautiful cheeks, moist glances, sweet words, and likening to roses, incense, dunes, moist branches and the like, and engages in descriptions of dwellings, traces, channels, wells, the water-camel, the large bucket, the rope, the strap and the ropes, and other things, would be outside his state, opposing his doctrine and his men, disapproved in what he brings of that, affected in what he fabricates of it. For every people there is a doctrine that befits them and is appreciated from them. The first who legislated that and established it for the Arabs so they followed him, and opened its door for them so they stormed and entered it, was Imru' al-Qais bin Hujr. The Bedouins appreciated his descriptions and similes, walked his path, and accepted his doctrine and saying.",

    "text": "So know that, O blamer, and beware of exposing yourself to blame a majestic virtue that has been praised on the tongue of the Master of Mankind, and the Noblest of Mudar, or to attain from a man of letters possessed of a peculiarity whose degree is not ascended and whose physiognomy is not feared. How many a high one was lowered, and a mighty one was humiliated and submitted, by his transgression against the literati and his diminishing the stations of the virtuous. And [how many] a building was demolished, a authority lost, a conjunction passed, a law abrogated, and a tight knot untied, while the landmarks of poetry are standing not bent, its flags spread not folded, its gardens lush not empty, its branches leafy not withered. It makes the fool forbearing, beautifies the noble, sheds blood and spares it, lowers honors and fortifies them, brings distant wishes near and distances them, and distances wide demands and brings them near. It benefits and harms, displeases and pleases, removes and appoints, impoverishes and enriches:\n'Who has seen in mankind a quality... that brings a distant one near and distances a near one?\nIt kills and revives with its sayings... and impoverishes an opponent and enriches a beloved.'\nAs for our saying at the beginning of the chapter: Is engaging in it more reforming or rejecting it more abundant and weightier? The answer: How can leaving virtues be better than engaging in them, and avoiding merits be more reforming than continuing their highness? We have not known anyone of humans who was able to compose poetry and was proficient in it, and left that, and was not famous for it and attributed to it, unless he was deficient in it, a silent last one from the forerunners. So it is permissible that he leaves it for his inability in it, and the running out of his good [poetry] from it. As was transmitted about Al-Ma'mun when it was said to him: Why do you not compose poetry? He said: Its good refuses me and I refuse its bad. Despite this, he has many famous poems. If we enumerated who engaged in composing poetry among the Caliphs, Kings, Emirs, Viziers, Judges, Ascetics, Commanders, Scholars, and Nobles, we would single out for it a book whose number is great and whose volume is heavy. Even a group of the kings of Banu Buwayh bribed a group of poets so they composed poems for them, attributed them to themselves, and recorded them on their tongues; because of what lies in that of high status, beautiful trait, majestic merit, and noble virtue. Were it not for that, they would not have adorned themselves with its ornaments nor decorated themselves with its robes.",

    "text": "Many poems were narrated from a group of the Companions, to the extent that they compiled a Diwan for the Commander of the Faithful Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, and narrated good poems in it. As for the Prophet, peace be upon him, Allah Almighty said regarding him: (And We did not teach him poetry, nor is it befitting for him). This is to be more eloquent in proof against those who claimed he is a soothsayer, and once a sorcerer, and once (a poet for whom we await a misfortune of time), (And they said, \"Legends of the former peoples which he has asked to be written down\"), and they said (Muddled dreams; rather, he invented it; rather, he is a poet). So Allah Almighty prevented him from poetry as an honor to him since poetry was the habit of the people of his era in which he was sent. It was forbidden to him as an indication of his truthfulness and a testimony to the falsehood of the saying of the invalidators regarding him, and as a purification for him from their fabrication against him, and an increase in proof for him. He sent down upon him the Glorious Quran which (Falsehood cannot approach from before it or from behind it), which if humans and jinn gathered to bring the like of it, even if they assisted one another, they would not bring it. So he, peace be upon him, proceeded to challenge them group by group to bring the like of it, but they could not. If it were poetry and he demanded the like of it from them, it would have been easy for them, and present with them. His prevention, peace be upon him, from poetry was nothing but a virtue, a benefit, an honor, and a purification. There is no deficiency or shame on poetry by that. If everything Allah Almighty prevented him from so that the invalidators would not doubt was a deficiency for that art, writing would have been a deficiency when Allah made him unlettered, neither writing nor reading; to be stronger in cause, higher in status, and more famous in place. Therefore Allah Almighty said: (And you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand. Otherwise the falsifiers would have had [cause for] doubt). If preventing him from poetry was a blame and deficiency for poetry and poets, preventing him from writing would be a blame and deficiency for writing and scribes. God forbid that a sane person says that, while Allah Almighty says: (Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous - Who taught by the pen). And He Almighty said: (Noble writers) meaning the angels. Allah Almighty made the people of the house of His Messenger, peace be upon him, his companions, and his brothers scribes and reckoners, just as He made of them poets and Rajaz reciters. Among his wives, peace be upon him, were those who wrote and read; they are Hafsa bint Umar, Aisha bint Abu Bakr, and Umm Salamah, may Allah Almighty have mercy on them all. They narrated from him, peace be upon him, that on the Day of the Confederates (Ahzab) he was moving earth and saying:\n'O Allah, were it not for You we would not have been guided... nor given charity nor prayed.'\nThey narrated from him, upon him be peace, that on the Day of Hunayn he was on his white mule saying:\n'I am the Prophet, no lie... I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib.'\nThey narrated that he, peace be upon him, was hit on his noble finger by a stone and it bled, so he said:\n'Are you but a finger that bled... and in the way of Allah is what you met.'\nI say: These reports, if authentic, mean that he, peace be upon him, was quoting them and not establishing their meter (Wazn), confirming and submitting to what Allah Almighty informed of, and He is the most truthful in speech. It is possible that he was saying: 'O Allah, we would not have been guided were it not for You, nor prayed nor given charity', and saying: 'I am the Prophet, no lie, I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib', and saying: 'Are you but a finger that bled, and in the way of Allah is what it met', or something close to this. Even if these reports are not agreed upon, the reasoning has fallen.",

    "text": "It was said: Abu Ali al-Manqari entered upon Al-Ma'mun while he was reclining on his bedding. Al-Ma'mun said to him: 'It reached me that you are unlettered, that you do not establish poetry (meter), and that you make solecisms.' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, as for solecism, perhaps my tongue preceded with some of it. As for unletteredness and breaking poetry, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, did not write nor establish poetry.' Al-Ma'mun sat up straight, anger appearing on his face, and said: 'Woe to you. I asked you about three defects in you, and you increased me a fourth; which is your ignorance and stupidity, O ignorant one! That was a virtue in the Prophet, peace be upon him, and it is a deficiency and vice in you and your likes. The Prophet was only prevented from that to negate suspicion from him, not for a defect in poetry and writing, nor for a deficiency attached to them.' When Al-Manqari heard that, he said: 'You spoke the truth, O Commander of the Faithful; many a suspicion stumbled upon weakness.' It was said: Of the honor of the descendants of Fatimah, daughter of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, is that no one, even if his house is great and his origin noble, but wishes he were a Fatimid. Likewise, I say: There is no one, even if his worth is high and his mention elevated, but wishes he could say poetry well and compose it, to beautify himself with it and adorn himself with its lineage. Some people said: So what do you say regarding his saying, peace be upon him: (Imru' al-Qais is the bearer of the banner of poets, leading them to the Fire). Is this praise for poetry or blame? I said: If you contemplate the intent and verify the desire, you find the meaning leads to the praise of poetry. That is because he, peace be upon him, meant the bearer of the banner of the poets of Jahiliyya and the disbelievers, who satirized the Messenger of Allah and satirized the Muslims and deserved the Fire for their disbelief, not their poetry. There is no disagreement or dispute among scholars on that. If he intended generality, under that would fall his Companions who are guaranteed Paradise, his allies who believe in him, the Muhajirun, the Ansar, and the Tabi'un. God forbid that a Muslim goes to that or a sane person or scholar says it. His intent, peace be upon him, was only to aggrandize the state of Imru' al-Qais, maximize his affair, and prioritize his poetry over his peers and counterparts, and that he deserved precedence and preference over them by the quality of his poetry, the beauty of his meanings, and the impact of his similes. So he made him for that their dean, their master, the one preceding them, and their leader. He did not deserve for his disbelief anything but the Fire, and for the goodness of his poetry anything but precedence over poets. So this attribute was fitting for him, and its mark on him true. The praise of poetry has appeared to you in the folds of this blame. Similar to that is what Al-Asma'i narrated that a Bedouin came to a cousin of his and asked him for a dowry he owed, but he gave him nothing and turned him away disappointed. He came to a Magian man and complained to him of what happened from his cousin. The Magian gave him what he requested and released to him what his cousin had withheld from him. He began saying:\n'The Magian sufficed me the dowry of Al-Rabab... a ransom for the Magian are a maternal uncle and a paternal uncle.\nI was made to witness your good nature... and that you are the generous, the abundant giver.\nAnd that you are the master of the people of Hell... when you fall among those who wronged.\nYou neighbor Pharaoh in its bottom... and Haman and the one nicknamed Al-Hakam.'\nThere is no doubt that the Bedouin did not intend to diminish and lower the Magian despite his kindness to him when his cousin deprived him, especially since he ransomed him with his two sides: his maternal and paternal uncles. But he intended to aggrandize the matter of the Magian, so he made him the master of the people of Hell and neighboring Pharaoh, Haman, and Abu Jahl bin Hisham, since the Magian did not deserve anything but the Fire. If he deserved Paradise, he would have placed him with its righteous and nobles. The meaning is apparent. It was said that when Hassan heard the saying of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, regarding Imru' al-Qais, he said: 'I wish he said that about me while I am the one rolled in the Fire,' out of eagerness to reach the ultimate goal which necessitated the preference of Imru' al-Qais over all his counterparts and his precedence over all his peers. Some people asked about the saying of Al-Radi al-Musawi:\n'Why do you accept to be called a poet?... Distance to it from the number of virtues.'\nWe said: Al-Radi was a seeker of a great position, talking to himself of grave matters:\n'Wishes, if they are true, are the best wishes... otherwise, he has spent with them a comfortable time.'",

    "text": "So every noble virtue and majestic merit is belittled at his desire, and every high degree and impregnable domain is low and easy at his quest. His intent is to say: How do you accept for yourself that it be said of you: 'This is a poet', limiting yourself to this mark, satisfied with this status, stopping at this end, and leaving seriousness and diligence in attaining the rank you hope for and achieving the wish you seek. Then he said: 'Distance to it from the number of virtues', meaning distance to this deed from being counted among the virtues you were singled out with, urging himself and inciting it to seek a matter that is of higher place than poetry, more expensive ornament, more fulfilling honor, more abundant value, and dearer position. He did not intend that poetry is a despicable trait and blameworthy characteristic. How could he go to that or claim it or say it, when by poetry his name became famous, his star shone, his share of literature became abundant, his arrow hit the mark in pride, he spent his life in it, and passed his time accompanying it. If he claimed that poetry is a base trait and lowly position, his claim would not be heeded, nor would it be consistent for him to argue with that against his opponent's argument, nor is his saying in it accepted or conceded to him. Preceding is the saying of the Messenger, peace be upon him, in praising and describing it, and the sayings of his Companions, which refute every argument and clarify in victory every path. What indicates that Al-Radi was talking to himself of that with which majestic ranks and noble virtues are belittled is what Abu Ishaq al-Sabi' the Scribe wrote to him, either mocking him playfully or truthful in his praise to the extreme, which is:\n'O Abu Hasan, I have a physiognomy in men... I am accustomed from it that it speaks and is truthful.\nIt has informed me about you that you are noble... you will ascend from the heights to the furthest ascent.\nSo I fulfilled for you the exaltation before its time... and I said: May Allah prolong the Master's survival.\nAnd I concealed of it a word I did not reveal... until I see its manifestation for me released.'\nMeaning: Peace be upon you, O Commander of the Faithful.\n'So if I live or if I die, remember my good tiding... and obligate by it a right upon you, verifying.\nAnd be a protector for me in children and family... when the side settles in the bed of the sand hill.'\nI have no doubt that Abu Ishaq is playful in his saying, and that his interior in it is the opposite of his exterior. He only brought him what agrees with his purpose and what his soul talks to him about; to move with his jest the static of his water-wheel (manjanun - or madness?), as is said in the proverb: 'Move her young camel for her, she will yearn.' stranger than this is his acceptance of his saying, and his answering him with a poem, from which:\n'If signs of a cloud flashed from me... to your eyes decreeing that it be generous and pour.\nIt is not watering a quarter before your quarter... nor ascending an ascent before your atmosphere.\nAnd if nights confirm a cloud from it... then be the first given drink by the new water.\nAnd if you see a lion crouching for prey... watching the inadvertently of fates, looking down.\nThat is only to save its food... for you when he reveals towards it and verifies.\nIf time feathers me, I will be a falcon for you... pleasing you confined and satisfying you released.\nI will share with you the glory I gain... with the deal of a satisfied one whether you are rich or poor.\nSo you go with the half that is all richness... and I go with the half that is all misery.\nOthers, when they fly, leave their companions... a little below the heights, falling, while they soar.\nPerhaps the nights will reach a wish... and knock for me a door of luck that is locked.\nWait and do not find my resolve slow, for you will never see... a hanging thing if it does not find something to hang on.\nAnd if age holds me back from it, then... my glory will rise with me to it, verifying.'\nSo how can one who has the likes of this in his soul see satisfaction with the rank of poetry and not say: 'Distance to it from the number of virtues.'",

    "text": "In this answer is sufficiency, for the chapter has taken its due, and Allah Almighty is the Grantor of success to tread its paths, Allah Almighty willing.\n\n**Chapter Five**\n**On What the Poet Must Aim For, Avoid**\n**Discard, and Seek**\n\nThe poet must avoid trivial speech, silly words, low reclaimed meanings, and strange affected language. He should not use false similes, unknown allusions, distant descriptions, or feeble expressions. He should not abbreviate in the place of expansion, nor expand in the place of abbreviation. When he wants to build a poem or compose a piece, he should picture the meaning in his heart, represent it in his soul as prose speech, then prepare words for it that match it, choose rhymes for it that agree with it, and place it on a meter upon which speech flows smoothly and meaning is led. When he composes a verse, he should contemplate it with the contemplation of one not pleased with himself, nor deceiving his understanding and sense, and criticize it with the criticism of one obstinate in it. If it agrees with correctness and runs on the path of approval, [good], otherwise he must drop it. If two verses occur to him on one rhyme, he chooses the more effective of them and voids the other. The poet must not reveal poetry of his except after his confidence in its quality and safety from the defects scholars pointed out and ordered to guard against. He should not follow the way of the Bedouins in what we forbade at the beginning of the book. As for committing necessities that are not prohibited, their use is permissible even if they are a defect according to investigators and their speaker is considered an offender by them, except that avoiding them while permissible is better. One should not emulate those who did badly among the ancient poets, but those who did well and excelled. He should not follow except the path of good poetry, chosen composition, good method, guiding Sunnah, elegant, sweet, subtle, easy wording that captivates hearts, takes over the powers of souls, reaches understandings without a veil, attacks minds without a knocker or doorkeeper, resembling spirits in wording and delicacy, and magic in sweetness and subtlety. The poet must avoid plagiarism of poems and avoid raiding meanings. If he attempts to look at something of that, he should make his mind like a low valley supplied by flowing torrents from different reefs, or like one who composed a perfume from variant mixtures of scents, so the fragrance of what he composed is not known from which scent it is. It is told in the likes of that that Khalid bin Abdullah al-Qasri said: My father made me memorize a thousand speeches, then said to me: Forget them. So I pretended to forget them, and they sank then overflowed. By Allah, I did not want anything of speech after that except its ruggedness became easy for me and its difficulty softened for my mind. The poet should, when he composes poetry, repeat it with a loud voice, for singing in it reveals its defects and shows the affectation of its words. Do you not see the saying of Hassan bin Thabit:\n'Sing in every poetry you say... indeed singing is a track for this poetry.'\nThe poet should contemplate the hemistich of every verse so it resembles what is before it and matches what preceded it. Scholars have faulted a multitude of ancient poets for the like of that, like the saying of Al-A'sha:\n'A blaze-faced, white one, by whom clouds are asked for rain... if he fought people for their honors, a knocking.'\nThe second hemistich does not resemble the first, even if each one of them stands by itself. This is a meaning that should be observed and stopped at. Similar is the saying of Imru' al-Qais:\n'As if I did not ride a steed for pleasure... nor lined the stomach of a buxom girl with anklets.\nNor did I buy the quenching wineskin, nor said... to my horses: Charge a charge at a startled flight.'\nMuhammad bin Ahmad bin Tabataba al-Alawi said: These are two good verses. If the hemistich of each one were placed in the position of the other, it would be more resembling and more entering into the evenness of weaving. As if it were said:\n'As if I did not ride a steed nor said... to my horses: Charge a charge after a startled flight.\nNor did I buy the quenching wineskin for pleasure... nor lined the stomach of a buxom girl with anklets.'\nThe poet should avoid padding (Hashw) by which the verse is spoiled, like the saying of Al-A'sha when he praised Qais:\n'And I was informed about Qais and I did not come to him... and they claimed, he ruled the people of Yemen.'",

    "text": "Qais said to him: O woe to you, you say 'and they claimed'. This is a word only used when doubting the truthfulness of the sayer! So he made it a padding that spoiled the meaning of the verse. If he had said:\n'And I was informed about Qais and I did not come to him... despite his distance, he ruled the people of Yemen.'\nHe would have been free of that. The poet should be chaste in his poetry and not be publicly obscene with indecencies, nor be sarcastic in satire. For scholars blamed whoever relied on that, and whoever was immoral and did not cover up, like Imru' al-Qais in his saying:\n'And like you, a pregnant woman I visited at night and a nursing mother... so I distracted her from an amulet-wearing one-year-old.'\nThe poet should not use a word to establish the meter of the verse while it spoils it by its meaning. If the verse dictates that upon him, dropping it is better. Do you not see Dhu al-Rumma and his saying:\n'She-camels that do not cease (ma tanfakku) except (illa) made to kneel... upon bitterness or she throws with them to a desolate land.'\nHow he introduced 'illa' (except) after 'ma tanfakku' to establish the meter of the verse, so he spoiled it. Because 'ma yazalu' (ceases not) and 'ma yanfakku' in their speech is denial, and 'illa' is affirmation, so how can they gather! Therefore if you said: 'Ma zala Zaydun illa qa'iman' (Zaid ceased not except standing), it would not be permissible. The poet should, if he sees poetry difficult for him and refusing its side to him, leave it in that state and not exhaust his genius in it, nor burden his mind to storm its abysses. Rarely does poetry come in that state as the poet prefers. Perhaps in leaving it is the occurrence of a meaning that was not in the mind before. The like of that happened to a group of poets frequently. It was said: When Dhu al-Rumma came to Bilal, he began frequenting him and trying to start a poem about him, but poetry was difficult for him and he could not reach it. An old woman, upon whom he used to go early and late, said to him—and he was Jamil—: Your frequenting has been long, O youth. Is it for a wife you were happy with, or a dispute you were miserable for? Dhu al-Rumma turned to his narrator and said: By Allah, what I want has come. Then he began saying:\n'An old woman says, my going... to her door from my family and my coming early.\nTo a wife in the city or for a dispute... I see you staying for it in Basra this year?'\nAnd he continued in the poem. It was as if the old woman struck the fire-stick of his mind with her speech. The eloquent in language is to say: 'Fulana zawju fulan' (So-and-so is the spouse/wife of So-and-so) and not 'zawjatu fulan'. Ibn Manadhir said: I said: 'Time strikes at the peaks of Radwa', and I stayed a year unable to complete it. Then I heard a sayer say: 'Habbud'. I said: What is Habbud? It was said a mountain. I said: 'And brings down rocks from Habbud'. Similar to this story is what Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Nasr the Scribe narrated, he said: Za'im al-Mulk told me, he said: Abu al-Hasan al-Jahrami told me: When I composed my piece in which I describe the rooster, and its beginning is:\n'O many a parted-haired, red-brown... not fearful, timid.\nDarkness clung to his tails... when he donned the lightnings.\nSo fire is the color of his dress... and other than him is in a fire from it.\nHe was shod with pure gold and increased in... beautification so he was crowned with carnelian.\nYou think him wading the afternoon... and wetting a top with sunrises.\nHe walks with two spurs, either... for escape or catching up.\nThe glances of his two lookers became drunk... with the cup of his parting, the nectar.'\nI remained for days thinking about the spreading of his leg when he treads the ground and lifting it slowly to place it on the ground. I kept closing my hand and opening it seeking the meaning. A woman who saw me said to me: What is wrong with you, as if you are playing odds and evens (tuqari'u) with someone? I said to her: You relieved me and came out to me with my goal. Then I said:\n'Similar of steps he moves them... with gentle slowness.\nA leg that shows you the hand of the gambler (al-muqari')... in shaking hands with the road.'\nThe poet should approximate between words and not distance between them, for it is a defect. As it was said: Al-Kumayt recited to Nusayb his saying:\n'And we saw in it houris, pampered... white, in whom coquetry and lustre of teeth were complete.'\nNusayb tied his little finger (counted one). Al-Kumayt said to him: What is this? He said: I am counting your mistake. Why did you not say as Dhu al-Rumma said:",

    "text": "'Dark-lipped, in her two lips is redness and darkness... and in the gums and in her canines is lustre.'\nI say: What Nusayb denied is in the place of denial, and it is an ugly defect; because the speech did not run on a consistent order, nor did what resembles it fall beside the word. The first thing poetry needs is to be organized in a sequence and placed on the mark of resemblance. It was said: The uncle of Ubayd al-Ra'i al-Numayri said to Al-Ra'i: Which of us is more poetic, I or you? Al-Ra'i said: I am more poetic than you, O uncle. He got angry and said: By what and how? He said: Because I say the verse and its brother, and you say the verse and its brother's son. The poet should avoid words that confuse their hearers and readers, and not descend in address from highness to a low place; because it is more appropriate to ascend from lowness to highness. As for words that confuse, their example is what happened to Arta'ah bin Suhayya al-Murri, who had reached one hundred and thirty years. He entered upon Abdul Malik, who said to him: What remains of your poetry, O Ibn Suhayya? He said: By Allah, I do not drink, nor get delighted, nor get angry, and poetry only comes upon the like of one of these traits. And I say:\n'I saw man being eaten by nights... like the earth eating the falling iron.\nAnd death desires nothing when it comes... upon the soul of the son of Adam of increase.\nAnd I know that it will return until... it fulfills its vow with Abu al-Walid.'\nArta'ah's kunya was Abu al-Walid, and Abdul Malik's kunya was Abu al-Walid. Abdul Malik was terrified and it was hard on him, and the color of his face changed thinking that he meant him. Arta'ah said to him: I did not mean you, but I meant myself. A group testified before him that his kunya is Abu al-Walid, so he refrained from him. Were it not for that, he would have punished him and destroyed him. The correct narration is that the verses reached Abdul Malik, so he denied them and considered them grave and said: What is this churl and mentioning me? He ordered him brought to punish him. They testified before him of his kunya and that he did not intend him by that. When he was brought while fearful and terrified, he secured him and released him. He returned, and a group of his enemies had spread rumors of punishment and evil consequences against him, so he composed saying:\n'If we appear from the pass of Laflaf... then give glad tidings to men who hate my return.\nAnd inform them that I returned with envy... sharpening my claws and grinding my canine.\nAnd that I am Ibn Harb, the dogs of an enemy... do not cease barking at me, or my dogs bark.'\nClose to this story is what Al-Musawwir al-Anazi narrated, and he was a narrator of the Arabs, he said: I entered upon Ziyad, and he said: Recite to us. I said: From whose poetry? He said: From the poetry of Al-A'sha. He said: I was blocked and nothing came to me except his saying:\n'Sumayya departed early her camels... angry with you, so what do you say appeared to her?'\nZiyad frowned and got angry. I knew what I fell into, so I went out defeated. When he passed the people, I did not dare return to him, because Ziyad's mother's name was Sumayya. Dhu al-Rumma entered upon Abdul Malik, who said to him: Recite to me the best of your poetry. He recited to him:\n'What is the matter with your eye, water pours from it... as if from a pierced kidney-skin it leaks.'\nAbdul Malik's eyes used to flow with water. He said: So he got angry at him and ordered regarding him, so he was taken out humiliated, having known the place of his mistake. The next day he entered among the group of people and recited:\n'What is the matter with my eye, water pours from it...'\nUntil he came to its end, so he rewarded him. Of wondrous coincidence is that Abdul Malik had given Amr bin Sa'id al-Ashdaq his safety, deceived him and lied to him until he got him and killed him. It happened that Ibrahim bin Mutammim bin Nuwayra came as a delegate to the sons of Amr bin Sa'id al-Ashdaq. They said to Abdul Malik: We have not seen a Bedouin resembling Ibrahim bin Mutammim in intellect and virtue. Abdul Malik said: Bring him in. When he entered upon him, he saw from him what the people saw. He said to him: Recite to us some of the elegies of your father Mutammim for your uncle Malik. He recited to him:\n'Excellent knights on the day of Nushba left... under the dust your slain one, Ibn al-Azwar.'\nWhen he reached his saying:\n'Did you call him by Allah then kill him... if he had called you by the like of it, he would not have betrayed.'",

    "text": "Abdul Malik thought that the sons of Amr bin Sa'id had put him up to that. He got angry until his chest swelled with rage, and looked at his sons frowning. They knew what was with him, so they swore to him by divorce, confirmed oaths, vowed Hajj, and forbade wealth, slaves, and maids if they knew of his saying, or looked at it, or consulted him in it, or any word or deed occurred from them in this. He held back turning away and sent Ibn Mutammim out disappointed. When they left, they gathered something for him among themselves and returned him to his land fearing for him from Abdul Malik. The poet must guard against such suspicions and turn away from them. Among the words whose readers changed them is what my father, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, told me. He said: Haydar bin Muhammad bin Ubaydullah al-Alawi al-Husayni praised Yusuf bin Ayyub with a poem. Some of his enemies took it while it was in his handwriting. Among it was: 'Let not the transgressor (Al-Bāghī) be deceived by your patience (Anātuka).' He scraped the two dots of the Ta' (in Anātuka) a hidden scraping that hardly appears or is perceived, and dotted the Ta' with the dot of Ba' (making it B), and added another dot to the dot of Nun (making it T), so the word became 'Atābak'. He brought the poem to Izz al-Din Mas'ud Atabak and said to him: This Haydar, son of your Vizier, has praised your enemy and has satirized you and called you a transgressor (Bāghī). When he saw that, he did not doubt it, nor could an apologizer remove it from his heart. Haydar was taken and deposited in prison, and remained imprisoned until he was on the brink of death. This was by misspelling one word. So one should guard against the likes of this. As for descending in address from a noble rank to a silly position, it is like the saying of Abu al-Tayyib:\n'The King, the Professor (Al-Ustādh), grew up mature... before maturity, disciplined before discipline.'\nIt was not good in the judgment of the craft of poetry to address him as 'Professor' after 'King', for that is a deficiency in literature and ugliness in knowledge. Do you not see that a lowly word is not fit to be coupled with a noble word, and likewise a noble word is not fit to be mentioned except with what is of its kind. Other than that flaws the craft according to the people of knowledge. I have informed you that a single word spoils the entire verse. Do you not see the saying of Abu al-Tayyib also:\n'And there is no merit in it for courage and generosity (Nadā)... and the patience of the youth were it not for meeting death (Sha'ūb).'\nThe word 'Nadā' (generosity) spoiled the meaning; because his intent was to say: The world has no merit in it for courage and patience were it not for death. Because if the brave knew he was immortal, not touched by destruction, nor harmed if he threw himself into perils, there would be no merit for his courage. Merit is only for him in courage and patience with his knowledge that that leads to the destruction of the soul and loss of the bliss of the world. As for generosity (Nadā), it is contrary to that, because if a human knows he will die, giving his money becomes easy for him. Do you not see a person when reproached for extravagance in giving how he apologizes and says: I only give what I will not remain for, nor am I confident of enjoying it. Like the saying of the first:\n'I give what I am not remaining for... nor by it can I attain survival.'\nAnd the saying of the other:\n'My soul which owns things is going... so I do not grieve over a thing when it goes.'\nSo it has become clear to you that the word 'Nadā' spoiled the meaning. Close to this meaning is that the poet describes himself with what raises him then follows that with a saying that lowers him and puts him down. This is a defect that drops the virtue of the poet and weakens his precedence. For this, scholars impugned Imru' al-Qais, faulted him, blamed him in their books, and reproached him where he says:\n'If what I strive for was a minimum living... a little money would suffice me and I would not seek.\nBut I strive for a rooted glory... and the likes of me may attain rooted glory.'\nThis is the poetry of a king boasting of his kingship and describing what he attempts of his splendid might with the majesty of his affair and the greatness of his importance. So how was it good for him to descend from this majestic mount to a despised place, and wear a vulgar robe, saying:\n'We have sheep we drive, abundant... as if the horns of their large ones are sticks.\nThey fill our house with Eqt (dried curd) and ghee... and sufficient for you of wealth is satiety and quenching.'\nThis is the poetry of a Bedouin wrapped in his cloak whose ambition does not exceed what his tent contains.",

    "text": "Al-Hutay'ah satirized Al-Zibraqan with less than this where he says:\n'Leave noble deeds, do not rise to seek them... and sit, for you are the fed, the clothed.'\nAl-Zibraqan complained to Umar bin al-Khattab against Al-Hutay'ah, so he imprisoned him until he repented and returned. The poet should guard completely against a word that his listener takes as a bad omen, especially if he begins with it and opens speech because of it. How many a poet has been deprived of benefit by its path, and the robes of happiness stripped from him. Of that is what they narrated about Al-Akhtal when he entered upon Abdul Malik and recited to him a poem beginning:\n'The residents lightened (Khiffa), so they departed from you (Minka) or went early.'\nAbdul Malik said: Rather from you, O son of the uncircumcised woman. Take him out. So he was taken out. The next day he entered upon him and recited:\n'The residents lightened (Khiffa), so they departed today (Al-yawma) or went early.'\nAnd he continued in the poem to its end. It was said: Ishaq bin Ibrahim entered upon Al-Mu'tasim while he was sitting in a palace he built in the square, the likes of which had not been seen. With him were his family and the notables of people for congratulation. He asked his permission to present a poem congratulating him on the place. He permitted him. He began and recited:\n'O house of Hind, what effaced you... after the gathering, and what wore you out?\nIf your people bid you farewell and became... groups, and your dwelling became effaced.\nIndeed we see you while we are in you with envy... if what we were upon lasted, we see you.'\nAl-Mu'tasim took a bad omen from his saying and was repelled until his face turned ashen and gloom fell upon the people. He left that assembly and never returned to it, nor did any of those present. I said this is strange from Ishaq. Were it not for a heedlessness that overtook him from Allah Almighty covering his mind so he said what he said, either for admonition or discipline, he would have had of knowledge, understanding, experience in serving Caliphs, and criticizing poets, what would restrain him from uttering the like of this. Nay, but He covered their hearts. Ibrahim bin Shakla narrated a hadith proving that bad words may run on the tongue, without the judgment of the human, despite prohibition of them and warning against them. He said: I entered upon Al-Amin Muhammad while affairs were disordered against him. He said: O uncle, why don't you sit with us so we can be consoled by your words and you lighten our worry with them? He said: So I sat and we had lunch. He called for drink and summoned his slave girl Dibsiyya and ordered her to sing. She sang:\n'Kulayb, by my life, was more in helpers... and easier in crime than you, yet was stained with blood.'\nAl-Amin was enraged by her saying and said: What is this? She said: O my master, this is what you used to propose to me of old. He said: Sing another. She sang:\n'They killed him so they could be in his place... as her Marzbans (satraps) once did to Khosrow.'\nHe took a bad omen from her singing, took the oud and hit her head with it, and said: Get up to the curse of Allah. Ibrahim said: So I said, O my master, she only intended your habit of songs, so if you see fit to return. I calmed his anger, so he ordered her return. An oud was brought and she sang:\n'I see the tamarisk of Wadi al-Aqiq neighboring me... so why, when calamities assassinated Yazid?'\nHe ordered her dragged away, so she was dragged and taken out. He swore not to hear singing that day nor drink wine. Only three days passed until his head was cut off and stained with his blood. Abu Muqatil entered upon Al-Da'i on the day of Mihrajan and began congratulating him on it, saying:\n'Do not say Bushra (Good tiding) but Bushrayan (Two good tidings)... the face of Al-Da'i and the day of Mihrajan.'\nWhen he said 'Do not say Bushra', he rose from his seat taking a bad omen, cut the recitation, changing his seat, altering. Abu Nuwas entered upon Al-Fadl bin Yahya al-Barmaki and recited to him:\n'O quarter of decay, indeed humility is apparent... upon you, and I did not betray you my affection.'\nAl-Fadl was disturbed, taking a bad omen from that, and returned repeating 'Allah erases what He wills'. When he reached his saying:\n'Peace be upon the world if you are lost... O Banu Barmak, of those present and bedouin.'\nHis bad omen became established. He rose and entered the house of the harem. No one remained in his assembly but found that ugly of Abu Nuwas's choice. Abu Ubada al-Buhturi entered upon Abu Sa'id al-Thaghri and recited to him:\n'Woe to you (Laka al-waylu) from a night slow in its ends.'",

    "text": "Abu Sa'id said: Rather woe and war to you, may you have no mother. Wonder to Allah how that escaped Al-Buhturi, and he deemed it good to face a praised one and open his speech to him with his saying 'Woe to you'. What pleased him of this opening were it not for heedlessness that overtook him!? It was said: When Abu al-Tayyib recited to Adud al-Dawla his poem which begins:\n'Owhi (Alas/Pain), a substitute for my saying Waha (Wow/Joy).'\nAdud al-Dawla said to him: 'Owh and Kayyah (cautery/pain), woe to you, what is this speech?' Attention is only drawn to the misdeeds of the earlier poet so the later one avoids what was taken against him and wherein he erred. The purpose of that is not to diminish his nobility, nor to detract from his merit. The poet, if he places speech in its places, and puts meanings in their positions, his poetry is clothed in splendor, and his good approach earns him praise. If he excels in his composition, but does badly in his approach and lack of prudence, the offense covers the beneficence, and he deserves after honor the place of humiliation. Among the mistakes of poets is that Abu al-Najm al-Ijli entered upon Hisham bin Abdul Malik, who was cross-eyed. He recited to him his Lamiyya Rajaz which says in its beginning:\n'Praise be to Allah, the Giver, the Abundant.'\nUntil he reached his saying:\n'And the sun became like the eye of the cross-eyed.'\nHisham got angry and ordered regarding him, so he was beaten and imprisoned. Abdullah bin Umar al-Abli came as a delegate to Hisham also and praised him. He rewarded him with two hundred dinars. Then he went out from him and passed by Al-Walid bin Yazid, who was Hisham's Crown Prince. He said to him:\n'O son of the Caliph, to the Caliph... and the Caliph is soon.'\nHis saying reached Hisham, so he got angry and sent after him. He was returned from the road. When he attended, he said to him: Woe to you! You praised me in your poem which begins:\n'My night at Kanud in Al-Ghawr, return... with the purity of passion from Umm Usayd.'\nAnd you said in it to me:\n'And He protected you from deaths from an heir, a ruler... and the Lord of Hud kept you righteous.'\nThen you passed by Al-Walid and announced my death to him! May Allah make you ugly. He ordered regarding him, so he was beaten two hundred lashes, a lash in place of every dinar. Then Abdullah al-Abli stayed until Hisham perished and Al-Walid was killed. Marwan bin Muhammad rose, so he praised him and praised his two Crown Princes Abdullah and Ubaydullah, saying:\n'May they not be deprived of it, nor finish with it... until the beginning with you becomes decrepitude.'\nMarwan laughed and said: O Abdullah, Abu al-Walid (Hisham) has disciplined you. Some of the moderns glanced at that and said:\n'And your Crown Prince continues to be an Emir.'\nAmong the slips of the tongue that every poet, nay every human, must avoid is what Al-Akhtal relied upon with Al-Jahhaf bin Hakim al-Sulami. It was said that Al-Akhtal entered upon Abdul Malik bin Marwan, and Al-Jahhaf was with him. He had withdrawn from the war of Banu Taghlib. When Al-Akhtal saw him, he recited inciting Al-Jahhaf or mocking him:\n'Verily ask Al-Jahhaf, is he taking revenge... for slain ones struck from Sulaym and Amir?'\nAl-Jahhaf grabbed his beard and said:\n'Yes, we will weep for them with every Indian sword... and announce the death of Umayr with the thrusting spears.'\nHe means Umayr bin al-Hubab al-Sulami. Then he said: I did not think, O son of the Christian woman, that you would dare against me even if you saw me captured. He threatened him and intimidated him, and went out dragging his cloak in anger. Abdul Malik said to Al-Akhtal: I see nothing but that you have dragged evil upon your people. Al-Akhtal did not leave his place until he developed a fever. Abdul Malik said to him: I am your protector from him. He said: If you protect me while I am awake, who protects me while I am asleep? Abdul Malik laughed at him. From this Al-Sulami took his saying:\n'And upon your enemy, O cousin of Muhammad... are two watchers: the light of morning and darkness.\nIf he wakes up, you frighten him, and if he sleeps... dreams draw your swords against him.'",

    "text": "Al-Jahhaf went out to his people and said to them: Abdul Malik has appointed me over the lands of Banu Taghlib. He forged a letter, filled sacks with dust, and claimed it was money. He marched with them prepared. When he overlooked the lands of Banu Taghlib, he informed them of the reality of the matter, recited to them Al-Akhtal's verse, and said: I only got angry for you, so take revenge with your people. They attacked Banu Taghlib at Al-Bishr at night while they were heedless, unaware, secure. He killed a great slaughter of them. Al-Akhtal fled that night seeking help from Abdul Malik. When he entered upon him, he recited to him:\n'Al-Jahhaf inflicted on Al-Bishr an infliction... to Allah from it is the complaint and reliance.\nIf Quraysh does not change it with its power... there will be from Quraysh a turning away and departure.'\nAbdul Malik said to him: To where, O son of the uncircumcised woman? He said: To the Fire, O Commander of the Faithful. He said: By Allah, if you said other than it, I would have cut your tongue. Then Al-Jahhaf met Al-Akhtal after that and said:\n'O Abu Malik, did you blame me when you incited me... to killing, or did a blamer blame me for you?'\nThis is what Al-Akhtal brought upon his people and committed against them with a word he could have done without and was able to leave. He who had the strength to incite with what he incited with, it was not fitting for him to have the weakness necessitating his saying: 'Al-Jahhaf inflicted...' the verse. When Jarir recited to Abdul Malik his saying:\n'Do you sober up or is your heart not sobering?'\nHe said to him: Rather your heart, O son of the uncircumcised woman. When he reached his saying:\n'Umm Harza complained then said... I saw the water-bringers possessors of milk-camels.'\nHe said to him: May Allah not quench her craving for milk. Then he sent him out disappointed. The cause was what he began with. The poet should not be ill-mannered in addressing the praised one, and should avoid what suspicion rushes to, like the saying of Abu Nuwas:\n'I will complain to Al-Fadl bin Yahya bin Khalid... her love, perhaps Al-Fadl will combine (Yajma'u) between us.'\nAl-Fadl said to him: Woe to you, did you find no one but me to combine between you two? He said: O my master, it is a combining of favor, not a combining of pimping/connection. By my life, it has a face to be explained by, and he was rich against the accusation in it. Abu al-Tayyib followed him in it, making intercession in place of combining. Combining might be by the gifts of the praised one, but intercession is not interpreted by that, so the meaning was spoiled for him by the word intercession. Jarir praised Bishr bin Marwan with a poem including:\n'O Bishr, giving glad tidings (Tabshir) is right for your face... why did you not get angry for us while you are an Emir?\nIt was your right to say to Bariq... O family of Bariq, why was Jarir insulted?'\nBishr said to him: May Allah make you ugly, O son of the woman who rubs herself in dust, did you find a messenger other than me?! Bilal took Dhu al-Rumma to task for a word below this approach when he recited to him:\n'I heard: People seek rain from a cloud... so I said to Saydah: Seek rain from Bilal.\nKneel at the best Yamani youth... when the adverse wind blows against the north wind.'\nSaydah is the name of his she-camel. Bilal said: O boy, order fodder and date pits for her. He meant that Dhu al-Rumma does not know how to praise. I say: He was not fair to Dhu al-Rumma in that; because the speech bears the possibility that he intended: So I said to the owner of Saydah, meaning himself, as Al-Harithi said:\n'I stood at the dwellings so they spoke to me... and the young she-camel did not control her tears.'\nHe intends the owner of the she-camel and meant himself. Allah Almighty said: (And ask the town), meaning the people of the town. If this interpretation is possible, there is no deficiency on Dhu al-Rumma by Bilal's denial. A sayer might say: Why did Dhu al-Rumma not apologize for himself when Bilal met him with his rejection? The answer to that is that the narrator did not say: That Dhu al-Rumma did not apologize for himself nor was prevented from that, but his intent was to narrate Bilal's saying. It is possible that Dhu al-Rumma apologized to Bilal with that or other than it and won with his argument. It is possible that he did not understand Bilal's intent by fodder and date pits to answer him, because he is a Bedouin who does not know the idiom of the speech of the city dwellers. The point is that he was not ignorant of the extent of what we mentioned, nor far from it. As for his saying: 'Sami'tu al-nasu' (I heard the people) with Raf' (nominative) of the Sin of Al-Nas, it was raised based on quotation (Hikaya), meaning I heard a sayer saying: 'Al-nasu yantaji'una' (The people seek rain), as the other said:",

    "text": "'We found in the book of Tamim... The most worthy of horses for running is the loaned (Al-mu'aru).'\nAhqqu is subject and Al-mu'aru is its predicate, with undotted Ayn. It means the horse breaks loose and goes right and left from its liveliness and energy. It is said: 'Ara al-farisu wa a'arahu sahibuhu' so he is 'mu'ar'. People think 'Al-mu'ar' is from 'Ariya' (loan), which is a mistake. Some people of literature narrated it in the handwriting of Abu Ali al-Farisi: 'Al-Mughar' with dotted Ghayn, from 'Aghartu al-habla' (I twisted the rope tight), so it is 'Mughar'. Meaning that the horse, if lean and compact in its fat and stoutness goes away from it, is worthy of being raced with. I did not see scholars of language relying on this meaning, and the correct is what they narrated first. Among what the poet should avoid of bad manners in his address, and turn upon it good research and investigation so he guides to the rain of its correctness, is what poets erred in and scholars faulted them for, like the saying of some of them praising Zubayda while she was listening, from verses:\n'O Zubayda daughter of Ja'far... Blessed is your visitor, the rewarded.\nYou give from your two legs what... the palms give to the desires.'\nThe servants and retinue intended to beat him. She said: Leave him, for he only intended good, but he missed the correct way and strayed from the path, because he heard their saying in poetry: 'Your left hand is more generous than the right of another, and your back is better than the face of another.' He thought that what he went to was of that sort. Give him what he hoped for and alert him to what he neglected. People marveled at her clemency and the brightness of her sense and understanding. Not every praised one is forbearing, nor every listener knowledgeable. Close to this is what Abu al-Tayyib elegized the mother of Sayf al-Dawla with, saying:\n'The canopy of glory is extended over you... and the kingdom of Ali your son is in perfection.'\nWere it not for heedlessness that took away Abu al-Tayyib's mind and covered his sense and understanding, he would not have addressed a king regarding his mother with that, nor made anything extended over her. This is like his saying also:\n'If I could, I would have ridden all people... to Sa'id bin Abdullah as camels.'\nDid Abu al-Tayyib not know that Sa'id's wife and mother are among all people? So how did that escape him until he adopted it, and confronted the praised one with it and recited it?! To Allah is the goodness of Al-Mutawakkil al-Laythi where he says:\n'Poetry is the core of a man, he displays it... and speech is like the locations of arrows.\nOf them is one falling short of its target... and piercing ones (Nawaqir) that take the prize.'\nHe took that from their saying: Evil is like arrows in your quiver when you shoot at the target. Of it is rising, falling, side-hitting, and short. The rising is that which goes above the target, not deviating right or left, and it is liked. The falling is that which hits the target. The side-hitting is that which falls to the right or left of the target, and it is the worst. The short is that which falls short of the target and does not reach it. His saying: 'and piercing ones that take the prize', meaning hitting the mark. It is said: 'Naqara al-sahmu' so it is 'Naqir' if it hits. Al-Nawaqir: Calamities. The poet should avoid contradiction in his poetry, for it is of the fullest defects of poetry indicating his ignorance of meanings and placing speech in its places. A group of ancient poets were faulted for that. It is that the poet begins with something and establishes it, then follows it, either in the rest of the verse or in the one following it, contradicting what he built, and bringing what opposes its meaning. Of that is what Abdul Rahman al-Qass contradicted in by way of the relative, where he says:\n'And indeed I, whenever death settles in her soul... it is removed from my soul before that, so I am buried.'\nHe combined before and after, and they are relative, because there is no before except for an after, and no after except for a before. For his saying: 'if death settles in her'—and in this speech is the meaning of condition and he placed it to have an answer he brings—and its answer is: 'it is removed from my soul before that', this is a contradiction. Its example is the sayer saying: 'If Zaid dies, Amr dies before him.' So he made what is before, after. This is a meaning many people err in and do not verify. Similar to it in contradiction by way of affirmation and negation is his saying also:\n'I see her abandonment and killing as two likes, so shorten... your blame, for killing is more relieving and easier.'",

    "text": "He affirmed that abandonment and killing are two likes, then negated that from them by his saying: 'Indeed killing is more relieving and easier.' It is as if he said: Indeed killing is like abandonment and it is not like it. Of that is the saying of Ibn Nawfal:\n'To eight unbelievers and a sheikh... old of age, possessing sight, blind (Darir).'\nDarir: Fa'il form from Durr (harm/blindness), and it is not used mostly except for one who has no sight. So it is as if he says: He has sight and he has no sight; he is seeing blind. This is an apparent contradiction. Muslim bin al-Walid said:\n'He disobeyed youth so he went (Raha) not dotard... and stayed (Aqama) between determination and endurance.'\nAl-Hakami said to him: How can a human be going (Ra'ih) staying (Muqim), and Rawah is only by moving from place to place. Then you said 'and stayed between determination and endurance', so you made him moving staying. This is a contradiction, and I have an argument for it, this is not the place to mention it. Mahmud bin Marwan Ibn Abi al-Janub said:\n'I have a trick regarding one who slanders... but in the liar there is no trick.\nWhoever creates what he wants... then my trick in him is little.'\nHe contradicted because he said: 'But in the liar there is no trick', then said: 'then my trick in him is little'. This is apparent and clear. The poet should avoid Tathlim (Notching), which is coming with nouns incomplete to establish the meter, like the saying of Alqama bin Abada al-Fahl:\n'As if their pitcher is a gazelle on a high place... covered with pieces (Saba) of linen, veiled.'\nHe intended 'Saba'ib' (pieces/strips) of linen, so he deleted. And like the saying of Labid:\n'The dwellings (Al-Mana) at Mutali' were effaced so Aban.'\nHe intended 'Al-Manazil' so he deleted. Ishaq bin Khalaf al-Basri said:\n'And the wearing of dust and the fluttering [banners]... show you deaths (Al-Mana) at the heads of spears.'\nHe intended 'Al-Manaya' so he deleted. The other said:\n'And the weaving of Sulaym (Solomon) every destroying, trailing [coat of mail].'\nHe intended: And the weaving of Sulayman, so he deleted the Nun. Another said:\n'From the weaving of David father of Sallam.'\nHe made Sulayman Sallam, which is an ugly change. The poet should avoid Tadhnib (Tailing), which is the opposite of Tathlim. That is coming with words falling short of establishing the meter, so he increases letters to them to complete the Arud of the verse, like the saying of the poet:\n'Not like Abd al-Malik or like Yazid... or Sulayman after or like Hisham.'\nHe intended to say: 'Like Abdul Malik', meaning Ibn Marwan, so he made it 'Like Abd al-Malik' to establish the meter. Al-Malik and Al-Malik are two names of Allah Almighty. Just because a human is named by servitude to one of them does not necessitate that he be called by the other, just as one named Abdul Rahman must not be called Abdul Rahim. The poet should avoid Ikhlal (Deficiency), which is leaving out of the wording what completes the meaning, like the saying of Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Utbah bin Masud:\n'O blamer, the urgent of what I desire... is more beloved than the much slow.'\nHe intended to say: The urgent of what I desire, despite littleness, is more beloved to me than the much slow. He left 'despite littleness', and by it the meaning is completed. Urwa bin al-Ward said:\n'I wondered at them as they kill themselves... and their killing on the day of battle was more excusable.'\nHe intended: I wondered at them as they kill themselves in peace, and their killing on the day of battle is more excusable. He left 'in peace', and by it the meaning is completed. The poet should avoid Addition (Ziyada) as he must avoid Deficiency. It is bringing in speech what is not needed, spoiling the intended meaning by that addition, as the poet said:\n'So no drop of water of a water-hole, fresh... prevented from the hands of climbers seeking it.\nIs sweeter than her mouth, if you tasted it... when a night became quiet and its stars set.'\nHis saying: 'if you tasted it' is an addition by which he spoiled the meaning, because he implied that if you did not taste it, it would not be sweet. If he said: 'Is sweeter than her mouth, and indeed I am truthful', it would have been more emphatic in reporting and more correct in criticism. The poet should avoid Corruption of Explanation (Fasad al-Tafsir). It is to establish a meaning then attempt to explain what he established, but not bring what matches what he presented, so he spoils his explanation and contradicts his establishment, as the poet said:\n'So O bewildered one in the darknesses of night... and who feared that oppression from enemies would meet him.",

    "text": "Come to him, you will meet from the light of his face... illumination, and from his palms a sea of generosity (Nada).'\nWhen he countered the darknesses in the first verse with illumination in the second verse, he was correct and excellent. It was obligatory upon him to counter the fear of the enemies' oppression with victory over them and humiliating them. But he left that and explained it with other than what he established, saying: 'And from his palms a sea of generosity.' This should have been in answer to the complaint of poverty. If he said: 'And from his palms a supported victory' or something close to this, he would have been correct, so know it and measure it. The poet should avoid affectation of rhymes and summoning them while they refuse and abstain. For it occupies the meaning of the verse with a rhyme he brought forced and difficult. This is a defect scholars have stated. Do you not see the saying of Abu Tammam:\n'Like the white doe, she summered so she grazed... the flower of fresh Arar and Jathjath.'\nHe built the entire verse to seek this rhyme, and occupied the meaning with it. There is no added beauty in describing the doe grazing Jathjath over her grazing Qaysum and Shih. Abu al-Tayyib followed Abu Tammam in that, saying:\n'Great, like what is in me, let the torment be... Is the food of this nasal-voiced fawn Shih?'\nThis verse has several defects: Among them is deleting the Nun in 'Fal-yaku', and its mention has preceded. Among them is deleting the Nun with Idgham. Among them is the distance between its beginning sentence and ending sentence such that there is no suitability between them; because he began by mentioning his torments and sorrows, then left that and turned to asking about the fawn's food. What preceded of complaining about his torments does not befit asking about the fawn's food. If he said that the torments I complain of in loving a fawn, Shih is not among his pastures, it would be permissible, but it is as you see. Furthermore, I wish I knew! Does this nasal-voiced fawn, whom he intended in intention to resemble his beloved, if he grazed Qaysum, Barir, Kabath, and other pastures of gazelles, does the resemblance to his beloved cease from him due to the difference of his pastures which he feeds on? If the matter is so, then his beauty and resemblance are in Shih only. Were it not for the affectation of the rhyme, necessity would not have called him to arbitrariness that spoiled the meaning. We have exhausted the sections of what is in this verse in the 'Alawiyya Epistle'. Abdullah al-Abli said:\n'And He protected you from deaths from an heir, a ruler... and the Lord of Hud kept you righteous.'\nWere it not for the rhyme, it would have been possible to say: Lord of Noah or Lord of Lot, since attributing to Allah Almighty that He is the Lord of Hud is not better than attributing to Him Almighty that He is the Lord of Abraham and Ishmael. But the rhyme drove him to that, and from the chokings of necessity watered him. Rhymes may come which the charms of scorpions are sweeter than. Of that is the saying of Ahmad bin Jahdar al-Khurasani:\n'And no desert land tore (Shabraqat)... in which is the sound (Waha) of Jinn, Zizayzam.'\nMuhammad al-Taymi said:\n'You missed the face of truth in confusion (Takhtukh)... You will surely be stretched (Latumtakhan) with a stretching rope (Mimtakh).'\nIbn Manadhir said:\n'And whoever antagonized you met Marmaris (disaster/smooth rock).'\nAbu Tammam said:\n'And they threw him with the calamity (Saylam), the Khanfaqiq (calamity/desert).'\nIf Khanfaqiq were in a sea, it would muddy it. Rhymes may come falling in a place that if the poet strove for another to fill its place, it would exhaust him and weary him, and undoing what he founded in it and built would be impossible for him. For the likes of this the poet must search. Of that is the saying of Urwa bin Udhayna al-Laythi:\n'She withheld her greeting, so I said to my companion... What made it most abundant to us and least?'\n'So he approached and said: Perhaps she is excused... in some of what she withheld. I said: Perhaps (La'allaha).'\nHis saying in the rhyme 'La'allaha' (Perhaps), nothing like it falls in its place. Abu Nuwas said:\n'You remain and annihilation is for us... so if You annihilate us, then be (Fakun).'\nHis saying 'Fakun' (then be), no rhyme in the letter Nun falls in its place. Ulayya daughter of Al-Mahdi said:\n'And an estranged one in Al-Marj weeping for his grief... and the helpers in love have parted from him.\nWhenever the riders come to him from the direction of his land... he breathes seeking healing in the scent of proximity (Al-Qurb).'",

    "text": "For 'Al-Rakb' (the riders) there was a good place here, but she saw 'Al-Qurb' (proximity) more entitled to it; because the riders, were it not for proximity, their scent would not be sought for healing. If using the original is possible, no place remains for the branch substituting it, even if it fills the place well. Ibn al-Mu'tazz said describing doves:\n'Until they knew the tower by signs... looming to the looker from far away (Hayhat).'\nHayhat in this place is a rhyme no other falls in its place; it is high over whoever seeks it, expensive over whoever bargains for it. For Ibn al-Mu'tazz describing two horses competing in speed, he says:\n'How often I went early on a swimmer (horse)... generous to the spur, a jumper.\nA short-haired, locust-like mare competes with him... when he almost won, we almost [won] with her (Kidna biha).'\nAl-Mu'tamid Muhammad bin Abbad al-Maghribi said, writing it to his father:\n'My master, I complain to you of a disease... by which my heart has become wounded.\nYour anger has increased me in illness... so send satisfaction to me as a Messiah (healer).' \nHis saying 'Masiha' is of the rhymes which no other fills its place. Of that is the saying of Mihyar:\n'And they said: Can separation be while a man ties... his guts with the virtue of prudence? I said: It can be (Yakunu).'\nAl-Sanawbari said:\n'His death came at sixty, O sorrow... since his age was not sixty years (Sitina).'\nAnother said:\n'My covenant with your shade while youth was a guest in it... days your quarter was to the beautiful women Ukaz.'\nThe rhyme is Za'iya; nothing fills its place but Ukaz, which is the name of a market for Arabs in the region of Mecca where they used to gather every year. Examples of that in ancient and modern poetry are many. The poet should not oppose the preceding poets in their habits when they liken, and their intents when they awaken and alert, for that is among what is faulted and counted among his sins. Do you not see the scholars how they faulted Al-Marrar for his saying:\n'And a mole on your cheeks appears as if it is... the light of the full moon in a black night whose darkness is apparent.'\nIt is known that the mole is black, and the cheek white. Al-Marrar reversed it and made the mole like the light of the full moon in brightness, and the cheek like the night in blackness. This is other than what the custom of poets ran upon in describing the mole. The known is like the saying of Al-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf:\n'The beauty of a mole on her cheek cuts my heart... when she unveils it, it sings with magic.\nIndeed a mole on that cheek is better to look at... than the black spot in the brightness of the full moon.'\nAnd like the saying of Abdul Malik al-Harithi describing it:\n'As if it is a dot of musk... looming in the whiteness of ivory.'\nAnd like the saying of Al-Sanawbari:\n'And the mole on the cheek when I liken it... is a flower of musk on a moist earth of gold.'\nAnd like the saying of the other:\n'As if it is of jet-black obsidian... set in moist pearl.'\nThe like of this meaning in poetry is abundant. When Al-Marrar brought what breached consensus in it and opposed sight and hearing, the people of literature counted it a defect against him and a mistake from him. Among those who opposed the habits of poets in their intents is Al-Hakam al-Khudri by his saying:\n'Banu Ghalib were to their nation... like the rain pouring (yakifu) at every hour.'\nIt is not familiar for rain to pour at every hour, nor did poets describe rain with pouring at every hour or every month. They only likened the praised one to rain for the generality of his favoring, and that he is not stingy with his gift, just as rain generalizes with its downpour, and is not dissolved by its flowing saliva. Their meanings in this are many. Among those who opposed the habits of poets in their similes is Ahmad bin Abi Fanan where he says:\n'Do not lean, for I... fear that he breaks (yataqassafu).'\nThe beloved is only likened to the flexible rod and the moist branch, and is not described as breaking. Ibn Abi Fanan followed in his saying Qais bin al-Khatim. It has been said before that the poet should emulate who did well among poets and excelled, not who did badly and opposed the customary law. Ibn al-Khatim said:\n'As if she is a fragile (qasifu) willow branch.'\nIbn al-Rumi said in blaming Ibn Abi Fanan for his saying 'yataqassafu':\n'O sayer: Indeed I... fear that he breaks.\nThis description is nothing but... the description of a dried crucified one.'\nAbu Nuwas said in the like of his saying:",

    "text": "'A boy above what I describe... as if his stature is an Alif.\nWhenever he leans he terrifies me... I fear for him he might break.'\nWhen Abu al-Tayyib said:\n'Without embracing, two wasting ones like two forms of... Nasb (accusative vowels?), the thinner of them, and the Shakil joined [or the flank joined].'\nThat was faulted against him because he opposed the doctrine of poets in it and made himself and his beloved equal in wasting away. The custom is that the lover is described with wasting away, not the beloved, like the saying of Dik al-Jinn:\n'Both of us are a fresh branch... so this is worn out and this is moist.\nWhenever the wind blows... and the silk robe and chemise sway.\nThey show of him what is pleasant... and of me what love has wasted.'\nAs for likening himself and his beloved to two forms of Nasb, there must be a gap and separation between them. The custom of poets in the intensity of adhering and the tightness of embrace is other than that, as Ibn al-Jahm, Ibn al-Mu'tazz, and others said. We have exhausted speech and recitation on it in the 'Alawiyya Epistle', and reached the limit in it. He put 'Nahilayn' in accusative as a Hal (circumstantial), as if he said: How many a stand we stood without embracing, wasting away. The poet should improve metaphor and avoid in it the approaches denied on others; the happy is he who is admonished by another. Of that is the saying of Abu Nuwas:\n'When the fox of rejection appeared to us... I sent the dog of union in his pursuit.'\nAbu al-Uzafir al-Ammi said:\n'Passion laid eggs in my heart... and remembrance hatched.'\nAnother said:\n'The kindling of love nested in my heart... and the bird of distance incubated over it.\nI made Nabidh for passion in the jar of my heart... so worries behaved drunkenly upon my heart.'\nThese are metaphors like one wearing mourning clothes at a wedding. Abu Tammam said:\n'Do not give me the water of blame to drink, for I... am a lover who found the water of my weeping sweet.'\nWater of blame is of ugly metaphors. He also said:\n'You were not given drink after passion, water upon thirst... like the water of a sufficient woman (Kafiya) which an understanding one gives you.'\nHe also said:\n'So you struck Time in its two neck veins (Akhda'ayh)... a strike that left it an old ridden camel.'\nAbu al-Tayyib has in this chapter poems counted among wondrous wonders, including his saying:\n'A joy in the hearts of perfume is her parting... and a heartbreak in the hearts of swords and shields.'\nHe made for perfume, swords, and shields hearts that rejoice and feel heartbreak. And his saying:\n'I tasted the sweets of sons over boyhood... so do not think I said what I said out of ignorance.'\nAnd his saying:\n'So as if he thought the spearheads sweet... or thought them Barni dates and Azadh dates.'\nAnd his saying:\n'The palm engulfs his temples and his shoulder... so it gets clothed from him with the smell of the sweaty sock.'\nAnd his saying:\n'Saffron-colored in her saffron clothes... blackness from the fox grapes.'\nHe has many poems of this kind. Close to these poems is a story told to me by Abdul Rahman al-Daqqaq by my reading to him in the year six hundred thirteen. He said: Ibn Khayrun told me from Al-Jawhari from Al-Marzubani, he said: Al-Suli told me, he said: Yamut bin al-Muzarri' told me, he said: Muhammad bin al-Hasan al-Hisni had a son. He said to him one day: I have said poetry. Al-Hisni said: Recite it to me, O my son, lest the devil of poetry plays with you. He said: If I do well, will you gift me a slave girl or a boy? He said: Rather I will combine them for you. So he recited to him:\n'Indeed the dwellings at Mayyafa... stirred a sadness that has been effaced.\nThey made me weep for my misery... and made my head like the nape.'\nAl-Hisni said: By Allah, O my son, you do not deserve with this a slave girl nor a boy, but your mother is divorced from me three times if she gave birth to the likes of you. The poet should avoid raiding (Ighara). We have presented its mention in the sections of blameworthy plagiarism, which is: claiming the wording and meaning without the poet thinking to tire himself. No poet was blamed in thefts with uglier than it. Example of that: Waliba bin al-Hubab said:\n'O brother of the soul from Asad... you slept from my night and I did not almost (sleep).'\nAbu Nuwas took it and said:",

    "text": "'O brother of the soul from Hakam... you slept from my night and I did not sleep.'\nWaliba's saying is more eloquent because he said: 'I did not almost', and he who does not sleep might almost sleep. Most of Abu al-Tayyib's poetry is from this section. From that is his saying:\n'Praise guaranteed for him the return of his life... when it folded, so it is as if it is spread (Manshur - resurrected/spread).'\nHe took it from Abu al-Qawafi al-Asadi where he says:\n'His deeds returned his life to him... when it folded, so it is as if he is spread (Manshur).'\nAl-Mutanabbi said:\n'And indeed a draught enriches me from water... and I have patience from it like the ostriches have patience.'\nHe took it from Marwan bin Abi Hafsa where he says:\n'And indeed a draught enriches me from water... and I have patience from it like the patience of camels.\nAnd I raise myself above small ambitions... when the desirables of the great become scarce.'\nAl-Mutanabbi said:\n'And of the misery of the world upon the free is that he sees... an enemy for whom he has no escape from friendship.'\nHe took it from Ishaq al-Mawsili where he says:\n'And of the misery of the world upon the free is that he sees... an enemy and loves that he be called a friend.'\nAl-Mutanabbi said:\n'As if the daughters of Na'sh (Ursa Major) in its darkness... are virgins unveiled in mourning clothes.'\nHe took it from Abu al-Abbas al-Nashi' where he says:\n'As if the white-footed dark horses in it... are virgins unveiled in mourning clothes.'\nAl-Mutanabbi said:\n'Like the sun in the middle of the sky, and its light... covers the lands, easts and wests.'\nHe took it from Ibn al-Rumi where he says:\n'Like the sun, its place is in the middle of the sky... and its rays are in the rest of the horizons.'\nIf we exhausted the sections of his thefts in this section specifically, we would dedicate a book to them. It is the poet's right, if he takes a meaning he was preceded to, to change its words and make it better than the craft of the predecessor to it, or increase in it upon him so he deserves it. But if he comes with his wording and meaning, that is an ugly defect among deficient poets, let alone proficient ones. The poet should reconcile between the simile and the object likened to and observe that, so that speech does not come discordant and meanings distant. For if he looks closely at the composition of his poetry and the arrangement of his verses, and understands the goodness of its neighborhood or its ugliness, so he harmonizes between them, organizes their meanings, and connects speech in them, he will be proficient, counted among the proficient poets. Do you not see Ibn Harma and his saying:\n'And my leaving the dew of the generous ones... and my striking with my palm fire-sticks, stingy.\nIs like one leaving her eggs in the open... and clothing the eggs of another with a wing.'\nAnd Al-Farazdaq and his saying:\n'And indeed you, when you satirize Tamim and accept bribes... the shirts of Qais or the worn-out turbans.\nAre like one spilling water in the desert, and deceived him... a mirage spread by the Samum winds.'\nIbn Tabataba al-Alawi said: If the second of Ibn Harma's two verses were a substitute for the second of Al-Farazdaq's two verses, and the second of Al-Farazdaq's two verses were a substitute for the second of Ibn Harma's two verses, the simile for them would be correct and the meanings of their poetry would be consistent. Otherwise, the simile in the two poems is not falling in its place. This is criticism from Ibn Tabataba in the highest degrees of goodness and perception. The poet should not describe his praised one in an art of the arts of his generosity, knowledge, skill, courage, nobility of origin, firmness of house, and all what he includes in his poetry of his praise, except he seeks the utmost in it and is not satisfied in it with less than the end. For if the poet comes with a meaning in which he fell short, his critic does not excuse him nor say: His work is according to the measure of his praised one. When Kuthayyir recited to Abdul Malik his praise in which he says:\n'Upon Ibn Abi al-As is a smooth, fortified [coat of mail]... the weaver did well in its weaving and lengthened it.\nBearing its nails burdens the weak of the people... and the high-nosed chief is strong enough to bear it.'\nAbdul Malik said to him: Why did you not say as Al-A'sha said to Qais bin Ma'dikarib:\n'And when a gathered battalion comes... dumb, the defenders fear its drinking [of blood].\nYou were the advanced one, not wearing armor... striking with the sword, marking its heroes.'",

    "text": "Kuthayyir said: Al-A'sha only described his companion with recklessness, clumsiness, and exposing to danger, and I described you with prudence, soundness of opinion, and working on protection. So Abdul Malik was pleased with his saying. Yet Al-A'sha's saying in the craft of poetry and the rule of courage and valor is more eloquent and better. Kuthayyir fell short of that description, but it was an excuse with which he repelled his opponent and completed his deficiency. This is like his excuse to Muhammad bin Ali al-Baqir, may Allah have mercy on them both, when he said to him: O Kuthayyir, do you claim that you are of our Shia and our lovers, yet you praise the family of Marwan? He said: O my master, I only mock them and ridicule them, and make them snakes, scorpions, and lions—and lions are dogs—and I take their money and clothes. Like my saying to Abdul Aziz bin Marwan when I reproached him and he shied away some shying:\n'And I had reproached a reproach, so persisted... with me the excess away from the way of reproach.\nAnd your spells ceased not to extract my grudge... and bring out my mists from their place.\nAnd the charmers charm for you until... a snake under the veil answered you.'\nSo I made him a charmer of snakes. And I said to Abdul Malik:\n'You see Ibn Abi al-As while lined up before him... eighty thousand, their completeness has arrived.\nHe turns the eyes of a snake in a shell... to which the night clouds added their flow.\nHe turns away and overlooks while he is a lion of a thicket... if a jump is possible for him, he does not cancel it.'\nWhen he, may Allah have mercy on him, heard that from him, he said: O Kuthayyir, whoever wants the Hereafter does not desire the wreckage of the world. This is evidence that he did not accept Kuthayyir's excuse. It is like the excuse of Ibn al-Ruqayyat in his saying:\n'And some speech goes in the winds.'\nAnd the story is known. The poet should bring his approach close and not make his request far, nor intend strangeness. For if he becomes subtle, he becomes obscure, and if he uses savage language, the ears of narrators flee from him. He should present the meaning with the wording customary in its like. His metaphors and similes should be fitting to what they are borrowed for and likened to, not repelling from their meanings. For poetry, its freshness does not please, its joy does not shine, its margins do not soften, its branches do not leaf, and its chamomiles do not wonder, unless it is with this description. If a subtle meaning, strange wisdom, or good literature coincides with that, it is an increase in the splendor of poetry. If it does not coincide, poetry has stood by itself and dispensed with other than it. If the poet follows a path other than this golden path, and his tongue and wording fall short of realizing this demand, such that he relies on precise meanings with arbitrary words and disturbed weaving, even if something of sound structure and straight organization happens within that, we say to him: You have brought wisdom. If you wish, we call you a wise man, but we do not call you a poet nor eloquent; because you went other than the way of eloquent poets. This is a method not followed by those whom scholars of this craft thanked. The poet should not antagonize the people of knowledge nor take them as adversaries, for they are capable of making his goodness bad, his rhetoric stuttering, and his eloquence restriction, and twisting his meaning, and demolishing what he built. How many a man of letters have the people of knowledge dropped the judgment of his literature, and made obscure of his mention what he excelled in. If we counted them, we would single out a book for them. To Allah is Ammar al-Kalbi where he says:\n'What have I met from the Arabizers and from... the analogy of their grammar, this which they invented?\nIf I say a virgin rhyme in which is... a verse contrary to what they measured or scanned.\nThey said: You made a solecism, and this is not accusative... and that is genitive, and this does not rise (nominative).\nAnd they incited between Abdullah out of stupidity... and between Zaid, so the beating and pain prolonged.\nHow much is between a people who schemed for their logic... and between a people who were imprinted on their syntax.\nNot all my saying is explained to you, so take... what you know and what you do not know, leave.\nBecause my land is a land where is not lit... the fire of the Magians, nor are churches built in it.'",

    "text": "Perhaps the people of knowledge come to impossible meanings and disturbed words, so they straighten their crookedness with their reasons and fix their corrupt parts with their knowledge. Whoever is in this way, it is not good that he be angered or defamed; for many a calamity fell on one who is more calamitous than him. In the hadith of Yazid al-Raqashi to Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah, may Allah be pleased with him, is a wonder, if what he related is true, not fabricated. He said: A man from the Arabs stopped at a woman from Banu Amir. She honored his stay and improved his hospitality. When he wanted to depart, he recited:\n'By your life, the shirts of Amir do not wear out... from meanness as long as their skins are on them.'\nThe woman said to her maid: Say to him: Did we not treat you well and do such and such? Did you see any shortcoming from us? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Then what carried you to recite the verse? He said: It ran on my tongue so it showed it. A maid came out to him from one of the tents and talked to him until he became familiar and reassured. Then she said: From whom are you, O cousin? He said: From Banu Tamim. She said: Do you know the one who says:\n'Tamim in the paths of meanness is more guided than the sandgrouse... and if they walked the paths of noble deeds, they would go astray.\nI see the night cleared by the day, but I do not see... through disgraces, from Tamim, that they cleared.\nTamim is like the colt of the blacks suckling his mother... and following her with a hustle if she stumbled.\nAnd if a flea had its skin skinned... Tamim would drink from it and drink again.\nAnd if a flea on the back of an ant... charged at the two rows of Tamim, they would turn away.\nAnd if the elite of Tamim gathered their crowds... against a shackled ant, they would find it heavy.\nAnd if the mother of the spider built for them... her shade on the day of dew (generosity/wind), they would shade themselves.\nWe slaughtered and named (said Bismillah), so our slaughtered was lawful... and Tamim never slaughtered one day and named.'\nHe said: I am not from Tamim. She said: How ugly is lying for its people! So from whom are you? He said: From Banu Dabba. She recited to him satire about them. He said: No, by Allah, I am not from Banu Dabba. He ceased not moving from one tribe to another while she recited satire about them, until he left no tribe but attributed himself to it and heard its satire, until he resigned, having been settled in the abode of humiliation, and said: I am a man from Banu So-and-so. The story is known. Close to it is what was narrated about Al-Mufaddal al-Dabbi. It was said: A Bedouin came to him on a camel with worn gear. He greeted and uncovered a face like the polished dinar. Al-Mufaddal said to him: From whom is the youth? He said: Ta'i. Al-Mufaddal said, and he was forbearing, rarely hasty: 'Tayya ya kalimatan fastamarrati' (Tayya, oh word, so it continued). The Bedouin said to him with a tongue sharp of tip:\n'Indeed it is upon our questioner that we ask him... and the burden is not known until you carry it.'\nYou attributed us, so attribute yourself to us. Al-Mufaddal said: One of Banu Dabba. The Bedouin said: And indeed I am addressing a Dabbi since today! By Allah, I consider it a sin whose punishment was hastened for me. Do you know the one who says:\n'If you meet a man from Dabba... then cry for him deliberately on the middle of the anus (Sabba).'\nO brother of Banu Dabba, how is your knowledge of your people? Al-Mufaddal said: Indeed I am knowledgeable of them. He said: Which of the women of your people is the one who says:\n'In the privacy of a night and whiteness of a day... from the son of the Wa'ili is the cure of my heart.\nIn a bend, I pillow him on my left... and gather with the right the tails of my garment.\nAnd I stick my guts to his guts... and every difficult thing of my leading becomes easy.\nAnd I let his palm touch a body that rose... on knees like the body of the back of a cup.\nSo he gathers my shoulders to him until... he reaches my braids with the dust of earth.\nI say to him: May my father and mother correspond to you... your life from all people is enough for me.'\nThen he said: Which of your aunts is this, O brother of Banu Dabba? And he began saying:\n'The stumbles of the tongue are not cancelled... and by the hands of men, men are disgraced.\nSo make the mind a shackle for the tongue... for the straying of the tongue is an incurable disease.\nAnd benefit from the excesses of ignorance and look... how the ignorant perish by tongues.'",

    "text": "'Indeed, bridling speech is preserving for honor... and by speech, speech is stirred.'\nWhen Al-Mufaddal heard that, his color changed and his forehead dripped with sweat. Then the Bedouin left. Al-Mufaddal said: By Allah, he mentioned something I did not think anyone on the face of the earth knew. So praise be to Allah that I did not ask him for more. Al-Mufaddal's saying: 'Tayya ya kalimatan fastamarrati', is from a verse which is:\n'And Tayyi' is nothing but Nabateans who gathered... and said Tayya, O word, so it continued.'\nClose to this story is what my tutor Sheikh Abu Muhammad bin Abi al-Barakat bin al-Baqqal, the reciter, the tutor, narrated to me by reading to him in the year six hundred and two. He said: Abu Muhammad Salman bin Masud bin al-Husayn al-Qassab told us in the Mosque of Al-Mansur, he said: Abu al-Ghana'im Muhammad bin Ali al-Narsi al-Kufi told us, he said: The Sharif Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ali bin al-Hasan al-Alawi al-Hasani told us, he said: Abu al-Hasan Muhammad bin Zaid bin Muslim told us, he said: Ali bin Abdullah told us, he said: Harami told us, he said: Abdullah told us, he said: Ismail bin Mahran told us, he said: Ahmad bin Abi Nasr told me from Aban bin Uthman from Aban bin Taghlib from Ikrimah from Ibn Abbas, he said: Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, told me, he said: When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was ordered to present himself to the Arab tribes, he went out and I was with him and Abu Bakr, and he was a genealogist. He greeted, and they returned the greeting. He said: From whom are the people? They said: From Rabi'a. He said: From its peak (Hama) or from its jaws (Lahazim)? They said: Rather from its greatest peak. He said: Which of its greatest peak? They said: Dhuhl the Elder. He said: Is Auf among you, about whom it used to be said: No free man in the valley of Auf? They said: No. He said: Is Bistam among you, possessor of the banner and the end of the neighborhoods? They said: No. He said: Is Al-Hawfazan among you, killer of kings and stripping them of their selves? They said: No. He said: Is Al-Muzdalif among you, possessor of the single turban? They said: No. He said: Are you the maternal uncles of the kings from Kinda? They said: No. He said: Are you the in-laws of the kings from Lakhm? They said: No. He said: Then you are not Dhuhl the Elder, you are Dhuhl the Younger. A boy from Banu Shayban called Daghfal, who had just grown a mustache, stood up to him and said:\n'Indeed it is upon our questioner that we ask him... and the burden is not known until you carry it.'\nO you, indeed you asked us and we did not hide anything from you, so from whom is the man? He said: From Quraysh. He said: Bakh Bakh (Bravo), the people of honor and leadership. From which Quraysh are you? He said: From Banu Taym bin Murra. He said: By Allah, you enabled the shooter from the middle of the gap. Is Qusai bin Kilab among you, by whom Allah gathered the tribes from Fihr so he was called the Gatherer? He said: No. He said: Is Hashim among you... who crumbled the Tharid for his people... while the men of Mecca were drought-stricken, lean? He said: No. He said: So is Shayba al-Hamd among you, feeder of the birds of the sky, whose face is like the moon of the sky illuminating the night of dark darkness? He said: No. He said: Are you of the dispensers (Mufidin) of the people? He said: No. He said: Are you of the people of Nadwa (Council)? He said: No. He said: Are you of the people of Hijaba (Guardianship of Kaaba)? He said: No. He said: Are you of the people of Siqaya (Watering)? He said: No. He said: Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, pulled the rein of his she-camel and returned to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. Daghfal said:\n'The rush of the torrent encountered a rush pushing it... crushing it with its push or cracking it.'\nNay, by Allah, if you had stood firm, I would have informed you that you are from the Zama'at (small/lowly ones?) of Quraysh, or else I am not Daghfal. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, smiled. Ali said: So I said: O Abu Bakr, you encountered a calamity from the Bedouin. He said: Yes! Indeed above every calamity is a calamity, and tribulation is entrusted with speech. The rest of the story is known. The matter is as Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Indeed above every calamity is a calamity. Of the like of that, Al-Kumayt complained in his saying:\n'Is half a man from half a tribe insulting me?... By my life, I have met a grave matter from the matter.\nHail to Kalb that a dog (Kalb) insults me... and I did not return an answer to a dog.\nKalb has attained a favor by insulting me... that sufficed it ancient scandals and stigma.'",

    "text": "Meaning that the people of baseness and lowness are not exchanged poetry with (Yuqaradun) despite ability and capacity. Clemency is the most worthy thing used by those of prudence. And pardon is not from the scholar except in the pure essence.\n'Characters with which the Vizier Muhammad was singled out... and he rose by them in value over the Viziers.\nHe exceeded the chiefs in beauty and eloquence... and generosity that outweighed the generous ones.\nAnd he occupied the high place as a growing child... until he rose in it over Gemini.'\nGenerosity is of his ways, honor of his morals, and clemency of his natures. We, the assembly of literati, are of his makings; his hands are apparent to us, and his morning clouds are coming and going upon us. The mill of our hopes does not turn except on his pole. In every case, we take from his wealth and his literature. How much literature I borrowed from the lights of his sciences, and sought a wish from the blossom of the gardens of his dreams (forbearance). I acquired fragrance from the scent of his mention, and gained knowledge (Urf - or mane/high place) from the depths of his sea. When I sought refuge in his extended shading shade, and held fast to the mountain of his might from the difficult grave accident, and was counted in the group of his visitors, and was happy to belong to the total of his entourage, he turned away from me the eye of accidents, and withheld from me the palm of disasters, and filled my heart with security, so I did not knock a tooth (in regret) after his looking at me. So thanks for his favors is obligatory upon me, and his ample armors are a screen for me from calamities:\n'How many a favor and deed... I have from our master the Vizier.\nMy thanks for it is the thanks of the... dark green gardens for the raining cloud.'\nMay his state remain immortal, his blessing eternal, his elevation paved, his word guided, his authority obeyed, and his time benefit and benefitting. He has revived the dead literature with his etiquettes, and made benevolence his habit and custom:\n'So all that I have is from him... knowledge, favor, and prestige.\nTime refused me, so it compelled him... to care for me and forced him.'\nSince speech has brought us to this end, and we have brought in what we stipulated sufficiency and more than sufficiency, it has become obligatory to conclude the book, and shorten prolixity. And Allah is the Grantor of success to correctness, Allah Almighty willing.",
