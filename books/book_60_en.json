    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah, who taught by the pen, taught man that which he knew not. And peace and blessings be upon the most noble Prophet, his family, his companions, and those who followed their most upright path. To proceed: These are brief lines and concise words that I place in the hands of the student of knowledge who desires to learn the rulings of Sharia and seeks to study its sciences. These are necessary introductions for the student of knowledge so that he may be insightful and aware of what is required of him before embarking on the quest for knowledge, to facilitate for him the attainment of his goal, and for Allah to bless his knowledge and guide his steps on the path of knowledge. These lines are divided into two parts: Part One: The etiquette of the seeker of truth and the qualities and beautiful traits he should possess during his quest, and what he must avoid that contradicts and opposes knowledge. Part Two: A brief overview of the sciences of Sharia, their most prominent divisions, the fruit of studying them, along with a number of the most important terms in each science. I do not forget to thank everyone who contributed to the production of this treatise. I ask Allah to make this work purely for His sake and to benefit His servants with it. And may Allah send peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad. Written by Dr. Abdul Rahman bin Abdul Aziz Al-Aql, Faculty Member at the College of Sharia, Qassim University.",

    "text": "Etiquette before Seeking Knowledge: Indeed, etiquette and adhering to the traits of people of good character is the beauty of knowledge. A little etiquette with some knowledge is better than much knowledge with poor etiquette. The predecessors (Imams) used to learn etiquette and strive for it just as they strove for knowledge itself or even more. They used to learn etiquette from their sheikhs just as they learned knowledge. Al-Hasan bin Ismail said: I heard my father say: \"About five thousand or more would gather in Ahmad's assembly; less than five hundred would write, and the rest would learn from him good etiquette and good conduct\" (1). Abu Bakr bin Al-Mutawwi'i said: \"I frequented Abu Abdullah Ahmad bin Hanbal for twelve years while he was reading (Al-Musnad) to his children. I did not write a single hadith from him; I only used to observe his guidance, his character, and his etiquette\" (2). The Imams believed that etiquette is the key to knowledge, and that a little of it is better than much knowledge devoid of etiquette. Sharik, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"A little etiquette is better than much knowledge\" (3). And Makhlad bin Al-Hussein, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"We are more in need of a little etiquette than we are of much Hadith\" (4).",

    "text": "Likewise, Ibn Al-Mubarak (1) and Al-Layth bin Sa'd (2) used to say these words to students of knowledge. The successful one, the more he rises in knowledge, the more he rises in etiquette and elevates in character. Al-Hasan, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"A man would seek knowledge, and soon that would be seen in his humility, his guidance, his tongue, his sight, and his hand\" (3). Regarding this, the poet says: Knowledge is light, and a person's ignorance is his darkness ... Would that we race towards the light of knowledge. The stars of knowledge are morals that adorn it ... If you combine them, you set off for glory. A scholar is of no avail without character ... And a person of character is of no avail if he lies/fabricates. admiration for every scholar whom ... A moral soul beautifies, and trusts not in whims. There are types of etiquette and forms of good morals that a student of knowledge should possess: etiquette with himself, etiquette with his teacher, etiquette with his colleagues, and etiquette with the general public. We will discuss these types of etiquette in detail in this brief overview:",

    "text": "Type One: The student of knowledge's etiquette with himself: There are numerous etiquettes that a student of knowledge should adopt with his own self that lies between his sides. Many of them relate to his religious duties, which are rights of Allah the Almighty. They are attributed to him because he is required to establish them within himself and adorn himself with them in his words, deeds, conduct, and guidance. Among the most important of them are: (First: Sincerity of intention to Allah Almighty: Know, O student of knowledge, that sincerity is a secret between the servant and his Lord; no angel knows it to write it down, no human knows it to corrupt it, and no desire knows it to sway it. If you intend by seeking knowledge the Face of Allah, reward and recompense from Him, and the removal of ignorance from yourself and your Muslim brothers, know that this is divine success and a Lordly gift, so praise Allah for that. Continually examine your heart and strive against yourself in monitoring sincerity. Al-Hasan Al-Basri, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"A servant remains in goodness as long as when he speaks, he speaks for Allah, and when he acts, he acts for Allah Almighty\" (1). Therefore, the intentions of seeking knowledge should be as follows: 1 - Reforming the heart and acting upon knowledge: One of the most beautiful fruits of knowledge is that it reforms the heart and the inner self. Here is Imam Ibn Jama'ah, may Allah have mercy on him, guiding you and whispering in your ears, saying: \"Good intention in seeking knowledge is that he intends by it the Face of Allah Almighty, acting upon it, illuminating his heart, adorning his inner self,",

    "text": "drawing close to Allah Almighty on the Day of Resurrection, and exposing himself to what Allah has prepared for His people of His pleasure and great bounty\" (1). These are among the greatest intentions of seeking knowledge. The aim is that drawing close to Allah through knowledge is one of the purest and most beloved acts of worship to Allah. 2 - Removing ignorance from oneself. 3 - Spreading knowledge, benefiting others, and doing good to Allah's servants: by guiding them and teaching them the religion. This is one of the greatest types of benevolence. Allah says: {And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good} [Al-Baqarah: 195]. 4 - Defending the Sharia by disseminating knowledge and refuting the specious arguments of falsifiers. These four intentions are the fruit of knowledge. Whoever takes it rightfully, Allah loves him and grants him acceptance and awe among people. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them, said: \"If the bearers of knowledge took it rightfully as it should be taken, Allah, His angels, and the righteous would love them, and people would hold them in awe. But they sought the world with it, so Allah hated them, and they became despicable to people\" (2). He means by that: those who stripped their intention for other than Allah and wanted the world by seeking knowledge. As for the one who intended by knowledge one of the four previous intentions, or wanted thereby to obtain a position through which he serves Muslims, or wanted by knowledge a job to enrich himself from begging people and to fulfill the obligatory spending on his family, he does not fall under the station of blame, even if he misses the greatest purpose of knowledge.",

    "text": "And on the authority of Abu Yusuf, may Allah have mercy on him, he said: \"O people, intend Allah by your knowledge; for I never sat in a gathering intending to humble myself except that I did not stand up until I surpassed them, and I never sat in a gathering intending to surpass them except that I did not stand up until I was exposed\" (1). Treating the Intention: Sincere people agree that intention does not become upright for a servant except through long maintenance and much struggle. Sufyan Al-Thawri, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"I have not treated anything harder on me than my intention; indeed, it turns over on me\" (2). This does not mean that a student of knowledge should turn away from seeking knowledge and cut himself off from it on the pretext that his intention is not pure. This is an entrance of Satan to turn the servant away from Sharia knowledge. Rather, the student of knowledge must proceed on the path of seeking knowledge, ascend the ladder of knowledge, and strive against himself to correct the intention at the beginning of the quest and during the quest, indeed in all stages of the quest. This striving helps the student to be sincere and seek the Face of Allah Almighty. With continuous striving and diligence in seeking sincerity, the servant is granted success for a righteous intention and good work; because knowledge by its nature nurtures sincerity. Ishaq bin Rahwayh, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"I asked Waki' about a man who seeks knowledge, and his intention is to discuss it and narrate it or something similar; do you think he sins in that? He said: No,",

Punishment of One Who Seeks Knowledge for Other Than Allah: Whoever seeks knowledge for showing off, reputation, and fame, or to attain a worldly objective, is threatened with punishment. Indeed, it is reported that he is among the first with whom the Fire will be kindled on the Day of Resurrection. On the authority of Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: \"Indeed, the first of people to be judged on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who was martyred. He will be brought and Allah will make him recognize His blessings and he will recognize them. He (Allah) will say: 'What did you do with them?' He will say: 'I fought for You until I was martyred.' He (Allah) will say: 'You have lied. You fought so that it might be said [that you were] brave, and it was said.' Then he will be ordered to be dragged on his face until he is cast into the Fire. And [then] a man who learned knowledge and taught it and read the Quran. He will be brought and Allah will make him recognize His blessings and he will recognize them. He (Allah) will say: 'What did you do with them?' He will say: 'I learned knowledge and taught it and read the Quran for You.' He (Allah) will say: 'You have lied.

Then he will be ordered to be dragged on his face until he is cast into the Fire. And [then] a man to whom Allah had expanded [wealth] and given from all types of wealth. He will be brought and Allah will make him recognize His blessings and he will recognize them. He (Allah) will say: 'What did you do with them?'

(Second: Acting upon Knowledge: The goal and fruit of knowledge is that a person acts upon it hoping for Allah's reward, to win His Paradise, and to be saved from His punishment. Imam Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi, may Allah have mercy on him, authored a book titled \"Iqtida' Al-Ilm Al-Amal\" (The Demand of Knowledge for Action), in which he spoke about the necessity of acting upon knowledge as is clear from its title, and it is worthy of study, review, and reading. A person will be asked on the Day of Resurrection about his knowledge: what did he do with it, and did he act upon it or not? On the authority of Abu Barzah Al-Aslami, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The feet of a servant will not move on the Day of Resurrection until he is asked about his life and how he spent it, about his knowledge and what he did with it, about his wealth, from where he acquired it and in what he spent it, and about his body and how he wore it out\" (2). Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Knowledge calls out to action; if it answers, [it stays], otherwise it departs\" (3). The meaning of (hatafa) is called out and shouted (4). Abu Qilabah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"If Allah grants you new knowledge, then grant Allah new worship, and let not your concern be to narrate it to people\" (5).",

    "text": "If a Muslim acts upon his knowledge, he wins the pleasure of Allah Almighty and attains His Paradise: Act upon your knowledge, you will profit, O man ... Knowledge is of no avail if actions are not good. Knowledge is an adornment, and the fear of Allah is its decoration ... And the pious are occupied with their knowledge. Learn knowledge and act upon it as much as you can ... Let not amusement and argumentation distract you from it (1). The predecessors (Salaf), may Allah have mercy on them, were among the most keen people to act upon knowledge and the quickest to apply it in their daily lives. On the authority of Abu Abd Al-Rahman Al-Sulami, he said: \"Those who used to teach us the Quran from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, told us: That they used to learn ten verses from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and they would not take the next ten until they knew what was in these [first ten] of knowledge and action. For we were taught knowledge and action. He said: So we learned knowledge and action together. And the Quran will be inherited after us by a people who will drink it like water, it will not go beyond this - and he pointed with his hand to his jaw\" (2). The Salaf represented wonderful examples in initiating compliance and quickly applying knowledge: Imam Abu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy on him, did not hold the permissibility of wiping over socks (Jawrabayn), then he returned to the view of permissibility three or seven days before his death, and he wiped over his socks during his illness, and said to his visitors: I did what I used to forbid (3).",

He said: So I left him until the people decreased, then I said to him: We have a Sunnah regarding that. He said: And what is it? I said: Al-Layth ibn Sa'd, Ibn Lahi'ah, and Amr bin Al-Harith told us, from Yazid bin Amr Al-Ma'afiri, from Abu Abd Al-Rahman Al-Hubuli, from Al-Mustawrid bin Shaddad Al-Qurashi who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, rubbing between his toes with his little finger. He said: This hadith is good (Hasan), and I have never heard it except this hour. Then I heard him after that being asked, and he commanded the running of fingers [between toes]\" (1). As for Imam Al-Shafi'i, the example in him is clearer and greater; his Old School in Iraq and New School in Egypt are famous. He retracted his Old School in his New School except for a few issues which some counted as seventeen issues, and others counted as thirty-odd issues, and that was due to his discovering the correct evidence. And here is Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, who did not write a hadith from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, except after he acted upon it. Al-Marwadhi said: Ahmad said to me: \"I did not write a hadith from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, except that I acted upon it, until the hadith passed by me: That the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was cupped and gave Abu Taybah a dinar, so I gave the cupper a dinar when I was cupped\" (2).

(Fourth: Avoiding Sins: The student of knowledge must stay away from disobeying Allah Almighty, avoid paths of destruction, and beware of tracks of deadly sins, for sins destroy their perpetrator and throw him into a deep ravine. No calamity befalls a servant except due to a sin he committed. Allah Almighty says: {And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned; but He pardons much} [Ash-Shura: 30].",

(Fifth: Worship and Remembrance (Dhikr): Perpetuating the remembrance of Allah, seeking His forgiveness, and praising Him are among the most beautiful forms of servitude, and causes for the heart's purity, health, clarity, and tranquility. {Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured} [Ar-Ra'd: 28]. Indeed, the remembrance of Allah fills the heart with light and joy; rather, without it, the heart is in darkness and gloom; because \"In the heart there is a void and poverty that nothing can fill at all except the remembrance of Allah Almighty. If remembrance becomes the slogan of the heart such that it is the rememberer fundamentally and the tongue follows it, this is the remembrance that fills the void and ends the poverty. Its possessor becomes rich without wealth, powerful without clan, awe-inspiring without authority. If he is heedless of the remembrance of Allah Almighty, he is the opposite of that: poor despite great wealth, humiliated despite authority, contemptible despite a large clan\" (1). The student of knowledge is the most deserving of people to maintain the remembrance of Allah Almighty, and to have a share of Sunan, voluntary prayers, fasting, night prayer (Qiyam al-Layl), and reading the Holy Quran. It is ugly for a student of knowledge to be negligent in his worship. On the authority of Abu Ismah Asim bin Isam Al-Bayhaqi, he said: \"I spent a night with Ahmad bin Hanbal, so he brought water",

Indeed, the predecessors (Salaf), may Allah have mercy on them, used to seek help in memorizing knowledge through worship and draw closer to Allah through it so He would open for them the locks of knowledge. Ibrahim bin Ismail said: \"Our companions used to seek help in seeking Hadith through fasting\" (2). (Sixth: Turning to Allah with abundant Supplication (Dua): Supplication is the essence of worship and pure devotion; because it involves complete neediness of Allah and humility before Him. It is the most beneficial worship of the heart and has the most effect on it, especially if the heart of the supplicant is present and he evokes the meanings of what he prays for. If those supplications and invocations are from what Allah Almighty reported of the supplications of His chosen creation, they are most effective for the heart; because they contain the comprehensive words of supplication, true humility, and evocation of the meanings of Lordship (Rububiyyah); that is why they used to start their supplications by saying: \"Our Lord\" (Rabbana). Most supplications in the Quran also come started with seeking means to Allah through His Lordship. It is good for the supplicant, when calling upon Allah using His Lordship as a means, to evoke the meaning of Allah's general nurturing, which is: Creation and Management, and the meaning of special nurturing, which is: His guardianship of the best of His creation, His kindness to them, and His reforming of their religion and worldly life, due to their turning to their Lord and their humility before Him.",

    "text": "It is good for the supplicant to pray with the supplication of those firmly grounded in knowledge; because when He, Glory be to Him, praised them, He mentioned their call: {Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower} [Ali 'Imran: 8]. So they sought means to Allah through His Lordship to grant them steadfastness of hearts and their firmness upon what pleases Allah, and their preservation from deviation and turning back from guidance (1). (Seventh: Evoking Allah's Bounty and Favor: The successful student of knowledge is the one who constantly evokes the scenes of his Lord's favors upon him, which no book can enumerate and no counter can count; because they have surrounded the believer with a collar filling the earth and the sky. He is the One who poured upon him blessings, the highest of which is the blessing of guidance, which the tongue fails to fulfill its worth, as his Lord brought him out by it from the darkness of misguidance to the light of guidance and the vastness of faith, \"O My servants, all of you are astray except those whom I have guided, so seek guidance of Me and I shall guide you\" (2). Therefore, Allah admonished those who neglected witnessing His favors, saying: {They consider it a favor to you that they have accepted Islam. Say, \"Do not consider your Islam a favor to me. Rather, Allah has conferred favor upon you that He has guided you to the faith} [Al-Hujurat: 17]. It is the Quranic upbringing that strips the heart of arrogance, erases from it the paths of self-admiration, and fills it with reverence for Allah and acknowledgment of His bounty and favor. This was understood by those of determination and virtue like Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, when he was stabbed and Abdullah bin Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them, said to him consoling: \"O Commander of the Faithful, even if that [death] happens, you accompanied the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and you were good in his companionship, then you parted from him while he was pleased with you.

And as for what you mentioned of the companionship of Abu Bakr and his pleasure, that is but a favor from Allah, Exalted is His mention, which He bestowed upon me. And as for what you see of my anxiety, it is for your sake and the sake of your companions. By Allah, if I had the earth full (1) of gold, I would have ransomed myself with it from the punishment of Allah Almighty before I see Him\" (2). The servant's evocation of Allah's favor upon him removes the haze of vanity from the heart, washes it from the filth of self-admiration, and purifies it from impurity so that it becomes a clean vessel that is purified by faith, rises with the actions of the heart, and benefits from the actions of the limbs. However, if these actions exist with the impurities of vanity and self-admiration for the deed, they crush the heart of their owner completely, leaving no good in it. Allah Almighty says in the Qudsi Hadith about the one who boasted of his deed: \"I have forgiven so-and-so, and thwarted your deed\" (3). So kindle, O student of knowledge, in your mind the spark of feeling Allah's favor and His purification of you, {And if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, not one of you would have been pure, ever, but Allah purifies whom He wills, and Allah is Hearing and Knowing} [An-Nur: 21].",

Therefore, he must avoid things that violate Muru'ah, whether in nature, speech, or action, such as a degrading profession, or a bad trait like vanity, showing off, arrogance, haughtiness, looking down on others, and frequenting places of suspicion; all of that corrupts knowledge for its seeker (1).

Allah Almighty said: {And thus we have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you} [Al-Baqarah: 143]. Warning the People of the Book against extremism in religion has come as in the saying of Allah Glory be to Him: {O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth} [An-Nisa: 171].

On the authority of Abdullah bin Masud, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Perished are the extremists (Mutanatti'un), he said it three times\" (1). So the consequence of extremism is dire, and its outcome is ugly. Look at the Christians, how extremism regarding the Prophet of Allah Jesus, peace be upon him, led them to make him a god and a lord! And how extremism led the Khawarij until it caused them to fall into declaring Muslims disbelievers and making their blood lawful, to the point that they declared major Companions disbelievers, including Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him. The methodology of the Khawarij remains in the Ummah, weakening in one era and strengthening in another. In this era, it has reached its peak in declaring Muslims disbelievers, disregarding bloodshed, and distorting the image of Islam in the corners of the world. So we ask Allah to protect Muslims from their evils and guide them to His straight path. The Muslim must take matters with moderation and deliberation, beware of anomaly and extremism, be gentle with himself and his brothers, and endear himself to Allah's creation and endear Allah's religion to them. On the authority of Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed, this religion is firm, so penetrate into it with gentleness\" (2). And on the authority of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, who said: \"Indeed, gentleness is not found in anything except that it adorns it, and it is not removed from anything except that it defects it\" (3).",

    "text": "(Tenth: Open-mindedness in matters of disagreement: One of the most wonderful qualities that adorns knowledge and beautifies its possessor is to be broad-chested and open-minded in dialogue, calm in spirit during disagreement without anger, tension, or nervousness. Here are important matters that a student of knowledge must understand well and observe: 1 - Disagreement is an existing universal norm: Disagreement is an existing universal norm, and its cause is the difference in perceptions, intellects, and understandings. The Salaf among the Companions and those after them differed in the past, and the later generations after them also. Scholars may differ regarding the authenticity of a text or its understanding, and its indication of the intended meaning, as well as their difference in Qiyas (analogy), the saying of a Companion, blocking the means (Sadd al-Dhara'i), and other evidences that are a cause for the emergence of disagreement. 2 - No denial in matters of Ijtihad: A student of knowledge should know that one of the rules established by scholars is that \"there is no denial in matters of Ijtihad\". So it is not permissible for a student of knowledge to denounce anyone in a matter based on Ijtihad, and most issues of religious rulings are of this type. That is why you find the knowledgeable scholar the most open-minded person regarding matters of disagreement because he knows they are based on Ijtihad. 3 - Not to put oneself forward for Fatwa nor be bold in it: The Salaf were the most pious people regarding Fatwa, and they set the most beautiful examples for that, to the point that Ibn Al-Jawzi wrote a book he named (Ta'zim Al-Futya - Magnifying Fatwa) in which he mentioned wonderful images of the Salaf in their caution against putting themselves forward for Fatwa.",

Abu Al-Husayn said: \"One of them gives a fatwa on an issue that if it were presented to (Umar), he would have gathered the people of Badr for it\" (1). 4 - A student of knowledge should not force people to his opinion: Ahmad said in the narration of Al-Marwadhi: \"It is not befitting for a jurist to force people to his Madhhab (school of thought), nor be harsh on them\" (2). Therefore, the methodology of the Salaf was: \"My opinion is correct but accepts the possibility of error, and the opinion of others is wrong but accepts the possibility of correctness\" (3). This is a beautiful rule that outlines the correct methodology in dealing with the opinions and Ijtihads of others. It is a rule that whoever follows it, his mind expands in dealing with situations and opinions. Ibn Uthaymeen said - while listing the etiquettes of a student of knowledge -: \"That his chest be broad in areas of disagreement that stem from Ijtihad; because issues of disagreement among scholars are either those where there is no room for Ijtihad and the matter is clear, so no one is excused for opposing them, or they are those where there is room for Ijtihad, so the one who opposes in them is excused. Your opinion is not a proof against the one who opposes you in it; because if we accepted that, we would say conversely that his opinion is a proof against you\" (4).",

This confirms the Hadith of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"If a judge judges and strives (exercises Ijtihad) and is correct, he has two rewards. And if he judges and strives and errs, he has one reward\" (1). 6 - Excusing the Imams and Mujtahid scholars: This is a duty of the Ummah towards its scholars who are the heirs of the prophets. For this reason, Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah wrote an enjoyable book titled (Raf' Al-Malam 'an Al-A'immah Al-A'lam - Lifting the Blame from the Eminent Imams) in which he explained the excuse of the Imams in their contradiction of some texts, and their error in Ijtihad.

If it is not fitting for a child to say to his biological father: (O So-and-so) or: (O my father So-and-so), then likewise it is not fitting for him to address with such speech his sheikh who taught him, raised him, and disciplined him (1). The basis for that is the saying of Allah Almighty: {Do not make [your] calling of the Messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another} [An-Nur: 63]. The meaning of the noble verse: \"Do not call Muhammad by his name, peace and blessings be upon him, like the calling of one of you to another, but revere him and honor him, and say: O Messenger of Allah, O Prophet of Allah, O Abu Al-Qasim. In the verse is a clarification of revering the teacher of good; because the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was the teacher of good, so Allah Almighty commanded his reverence and honoring. In it is the recognition of the right of the professor, and in it is the recognition of people of virtue\" (2). The prohibition in His saying: {Do not make [your] calling of the Messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another} [An-Nur: 63], is by way of prohibition (Tahrim) regarding the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and by way of contrary to what is best (Khilaf Al-Awla) regarding other than the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, among the people of knowledge and all teachers.",

(1). 2 - Good questioning and gentleness in it: Indeed, among the wisdoms that have become famous among people: Good questioning is half of knowledge (2). They do not differ on this matter; for if the questioner asks his sheikh well, that calls for him to turn to him to clarify what was confusing to him; because of what he sees of his readiness and receptivity for that. And bad questioning calls for the sheikh to turn away from the student and answering him because of what he sees of his rudeness; so the student is deprived of much good thereby (3). This has been narrated from some of the Salaf: Muhammad bin Sirin said: \"They used to consider good questioning to increase a man's intellect\" (4). Al-Nawawi said - in his discussion of the student's etiquette with his sheikh -: \"And he should be gentle in his questioning, and improve his address\" (5).",

And Al-Nawawi said: \"And he seizes the opportunity to ask him when he is in good spirits and free\" (4). 6 - Do not be shy to ask about what confuses you: Mujahid, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"No shy person nor arrogant person learns knowledge\" (5). The serious student \"does not shy away from asking about what confuses him, rather he seeks clarification most completely. For whoever has a thin face (shy), his knowledge becomes thin, and whoever has a thin face when asking, his deficiency appears when meeting men\" (6).",

Third: Respecting the Sheikh: This is from the etiquette that the student of knowledge must follow. He should not argue with his sheikh nor harm him, nor be obstinate with him in dialogue and questioning; for the student might be deprived of benefit due to the ominousness of his dealing with his sheikh. No one angered his teacher except that he was deprived of his knowledge. Ibn Hazm, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"If you attend a gathering of knowledge, let your presence be only the presence of one seeking increase in knowledge and reward, not the presence of one who thinks he can do without what you have; seeking a slip to spread, or a strange thing to defame. These are the actions of the vile, who never succeed in knowledge. If you attend with this intention, you have obtained good in any case. And if you do not attend with this intention, your sitting in your house is more restful for your body, more honorable for your character, and safer for your religion\" (2).

The Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, used to teach their students and raise them to ask about what benefits and leave what does not benefit. Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, said one day: \"Ask me whatever you wish. Ibn Al-Kawwa' (5) said: What is the blackness in the moon? He said: That belongs to Allah.

If a student of knowledge wants to benefit from his sheikh and obtain his knowledge, he must be patient with harshness coming from him, or bad temper.

He should think well of his sheikh, interpret his actions and words that appear contrary to what is correct in the best possible interpretation as much as possible, construe them in the best ways, and strive to find excuses for him. Also, the student of knowledge must bear from his sheikh if he rebukes him or gets angry with him: \"It was said to Sufyan bin Uyaynah: People come to you from the corners of the earth, you get angry with them, they are about to go and leave you?

So whoever does not endure the humiliation of learning remains throughout his life in the blindness of ignorance, and whoever endures it, his affair ends in the honor of this world and the Hereafter. From Ibn Abbas: I was humble as a seeker, so I became mighty as a sought-after one. Fourth: Thanking him for his kindness to him: Allah says: {And do not forget graciousness between you} [Al-Baqarah: 237]. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"Whoever does not thank people does not thank Allah\" (1). It is obligatory upon a Muslim to preserve the favor for the one who was kind to him, and not forget his merit whoever he may be, so how about the one who was kind to you with knowledge, which is the most majestic aspect of kindness. Sheikh al-Islam, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"And if a man has been taught by a professor, he recognizes the value of his kindness to him and thanks him\" (2).

The way to negate envy is to know that the wisdom of Allah Almighty required placing this virtue in this human being; so do not object to nor dislike what Wisdom required\" (1). Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"Some of those affiliated with knowledge and others may be afflicted with a type of envy towards one whom Allah has guided with beneficial knowledge or righteous deed.

Let the student of knowledge beware of speaking about his peers inappropriately, and let not Satan enter upon him and blow into the fire of envy between him and his companions among the students of knowledge; rather, let him strive against himself in that. Al-Dhahabi said in the biography of Mutayyan (2): \"Muhammad bin Uthman bin Abi Shaybah (3) spoke against him, and he spoke against Ibn Uthman. The speech of peers is generally not considered, especially if there is competition between them. Ibn Uthman counted about three delusions for Mutayyan, so what?

In this is the virtue of knowledge, especially understanding in religion, and that it is the most important of matters, and that whoever learns knowledge must spread and disseminate it among the servants, and advise them in it, for the spread of knowledge from the scholar is from his blessing and his reward which grows for him\" (1).",

Abdullah bin Masud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"You do not narrate a hadith to a people that their minds do not grasp, except that it becomes a tribulation (fitnah) for some of them\" (2). Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Speak to people about what they know. Do you want Allah and His Messenger to be denied?\" (3). Al-Bukhari titled this narration: \"Chapter: Whoever specified knowledge for a people to the exclusion of others; disliking that they might not understand\" (4). \"In this narration is that knowledge should be specified for a people because of their retention and correctness of understanding, and the subtle meaning should not be offered to one who does not deserve it among students and one upon whom license and reliance is feared due to his short understanding\" (5).

This is clarified by the fact that the child, when his stomach was not strong enough to digest coarse foods, Allah facilitated his provision from his mother's breast for a long period in which he gradually moves to consuming foods remaining in their state. For milk was food, then it turned into milk so it became like the rising thing, so it is of the gentlest foods. If the child's stomach becomes strong, he is fed strong foods. Likewise, the scholar should be gentle with people in teaching, so he does not expose their minds to hearing what they deny before he is certain of the strength of their minds to repel suspicion, accept proof, disbelieve in Taghut, and believe in Allah, otherwise he exposes them to denial, as Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Do you want Allah and His Messenger to be denied?\" (1).

Fourth: Casting Salam (Peace) and returning it, and smiling in the faces of others: Casting Salam and returning it are among the causes of spreading love among Muslims. Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not guide you to something if you do it you will love one another? Spread Salam amongst yourselves\" (2). Indeed, the Prophetic Sunnah came commanding Salam upon everyone: On the authority of Abdullah bin Amr, may Allah be pleased with them: \"That a man asked the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, which Islam is best? He said: To feed food, and to read Salam upon whom you know and whom you do not know\" (3). This is contrary to what some people are upon, who do not greet except their acquaintances, and this is one of the mistakes in the chapter of Salam. Islam encouraged initiating Salam, and arranged virtues upon it, including: The hadith of Abu Umamah, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed the closest people to Allah are those who begin them with Salam\" (4).",

We benefit from these hadiths: the legitimacy of spreading Salam and casting it upon everyone, even children, because it is part of being kind to them and winning their hearts. As for smiling, it is one of the highest means of winning hearts; rather, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, considered it an act of worship: He said: \"Your smile in the face of your brother is charity for you\" (2). Al-Tabarani titled a chapter on it: \"Chapter: The virtue of a man smiling in the face of his Muslim brother\" (3). The guidance of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was smiling without laughing [loudly], as came in the hadith of Jabir bin Samurah who said - while talking about the Companions with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"They used to talk and take up matters of the Jahiliyyah, so they would laugh and he would smile\" (4). The student of knowledge's model and ideal example is his Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. How beautiful is the student of knowledge smiling, cheerful, with a free face. Ibn Uyaynah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"Cheerfulness is the trap of affection, and righteousness is an easy thing; a cheerful face and gentle speech.\" Ibn Al-Mubarak, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"I admire from the readers (of Quran/Scholars) every free-faced laughing one, as for...",

And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter} [Al Imran: 159].

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, considered the harsh person to be devoid of goodness, saying: «Whoever is deprived of gentleness is deprived of goodness» (3). If Allah combines knowledge and forbearance for a student of knowledge, He has gathered for him the edges of goodness. On the authority of Abu Razin, regarding His saying: {Be Rabbaniyyin (pious scholars)} [Al Imran: 79]; he said: «Forbearing scholars» (4).

It is also recommended for the student of knowledge to take care of himself in terms of cleanliness, bathing, perfuming, and removing unpleasant odors. Al-Nawawi said - speaking about the etiquette of the student of knowledge when entering gatherings of knowledge -: «And he should enter with full dignity, his heart empty of distractions, purified, cleaned with Siwak (toothstick), trimming the mustache and nails, and removing unpleasant odors» (2). Seventh: Distancing from gatherings of idle talk and clamor: The gatherings that the student of knowledge attends and gains knowledge and reward by attending are gatherings of knowledge, jurisprudence, and etiquette. He distances himself from gatherings of falsehood and amusement, where gossip, backbiting, tale-bearing, obscenity, immorality, shameless stories, mocking religion and its people, and ridiculing them abound; indeed, explicit disbelief might occur therein, and refuge is sought with Allah Almighty.

Eighth: Distancing from commotion (Haishat) and Fitnah (sedition): The student of knowledge must beware of places of recklessness, commotion, and sedition which are populated by those of light minds and bad manners, because they cause knowledge to lose its beauty and prestige. On the authority of Abdullah bin Masoud, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: «Beware of the commotions (Haishat) of the markets» (3). «And the commotions of the markets: meaning their mixing and what occurs in them of trials and raised voices.

Conclusion: The student of knowledge should adorn himself with the etiquettes of the soul; such as chastity, forbearance, patience, and humility to the truth. He should adopt the stillness of a bird: dignity, gravity, and lowering the wing (humility); bearing the humiliation of learning for the glory of knowledge and the nobility of its goal. O student of knowledge, beware of the nullifiers of these etiquettes, for along with sin, they establish against yourself a witness that there is a defect in the mind, and indicate deprivation of success. Beware of pride (Al-Khuyala'), for it is hypocrisy and arrogance, and the severity of guarding against it among the predecessors reached a great extent and a far limit (2). These are fragments on the etiquette of the student of knowledge with himself, with his sheikh, with his brothers and colleagues, and with all people.

Therefore, there must be rooting and founding for every art you seek, by mastering its original text and its summary with a proficient sheikh, not by self-acquisition alone. Take knowledge gradually, for it is the path to firmness. Allah Almighty said: {And [it is] a Qur'an which We have separated [by intervals] that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period. And We have sent it down progressively} [Al-Isra: 106]. So Allah Almighty commanded in this verse to take the Quran over a prolonged period and deliberately. Thus, taking knowledge and acquiring it should be likewise. So before you are matters that must be observed in every art you seek: 1 - Memorizing a summary in it. 2 - Mastering it with a proficient sheikh. 3 - Mastering its explanation. 4 - Reviewing what you have memorized and mastered its explanation constantly; for repeating knowledge is the guarantee of its stability. Second: Receiving knowledge from Sheikhs: The origin in seeking is through dictation and receiving from Sheikhs, and taking from the mouths of men, not from newspapers and the bellies of books.",

Third: Preserving knowledge by writing: Exert effort in preserving knowledge by writing it; because binding knowledge by writing is a security against loss, especially in issues of knowledge that are not in their expected places. Among its greatest benefits is that in old age and weakness of strength, you will have material to draw from and write in without the trouble of research and investigation. Al-Sha'bi said: «If you hear something, write it down, even if on a wall» (1). Fourth: Maintaining what is memorized: Maintain your knowledge from time to time, for lack of maintenance is the title of the departure of knowledge, whatever it may be.

Seventh: Preserving the hours of your life: O student of knowledge, «Time, time for acquisition... So preserving time with seriousness and diligence, sticking to the quest, keeping close company with Sheikhs, and occupying oneself with knowledge by reading, teaching, studying, contemplating, memorizing, and researching, especially in the prime of youth and the beginning of life, and the mine of the outcome. So seize this precious opportunity; to attain the high ranks of knowledge, for it is (a time of gathering the heart and concentration of thought); due to the lack of distractions and diversions from life obligations and leadership, and the lightness of burdens and dependents» (1).",

The successful one is he who occupies himself with what deepens his connection with Allah and increases his faith and attachment to his Master. For this reason, among the supplications of our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was that he used to ask Allah for beneficial knowledge, as proven in the Hadith of Umm Salamah - may Allah be pleased with her: «That the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to say: When he prayed the morning prayer, upon giving Salams: O Allah, I ask You for beneficial knowledge, good provision, and acceptable deeds» (1). The signs of beneficial knowledge are: 1) Acting upon the knowledge. 2) Increase in faith and abundance of acts of obedience. 3) Dislike of self-praise and commendation. 4) That your humility increases whenever your knowledge increases. 5) Fleeing from the love of leadership, fame, and appearance. 6) Abandoning the claim of knowledge. 7) Thinking ill of oneself, and thinking well of people to avoid falling into [badmouthing] them. 8) Spreading knowledge, and doing good to people by offering it, and seeking reward from Allah for that.",

    "text": "Sharia sciences are the sciences derived from Islamic Sharia and its two main sources: the Holy Quran and the Noble Sunnah. It applies to Tafsir (Exegesis) and Quranic sciences, Prophetic Hadith and its sciences, the science of Aqidah (Creed), and Fiqh (Jurisprudence), its principles, and rules. These Sharia sciences are the most noble sciences absolutely, due to the honor of their connection to the two revelations: the Book and the Sunnah. They are the most deserving of what times, money, and efforts are spent on. It is not hidden from anyone with intellect that acquiring these sciences is obligatory on every accountable person, to the extent that ensures his worship of Allah Almighty in the manner prescribed. This is what is known as 'Necessary Knowledge' (Al-Ma'lum min al-din bid-darura), by which rulings are known and acted upon, whether for males or females, since a person's need to reform his religion and purify his soul is no less than his need for food, drink, and other necessities of life. There is no doubt that knowledge is honor, light, and virtue, just as ignorance is evil, affliction, and vice. Beneficial knowledge is the source and spring of virtues, while ignorance is the ambush of vices and their path. Therefore, the highest people in rank, the greatest in status, and the most elevated in position are the people of knowledge of Allah and His Messenger: {Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees} [Al-Mujadila: 11]. So the most worthy thing for competitors to compete in, and the most appropriate thing for racers to race towards, is what guarantees the servant's happiness in his livelihood and hereafter, and is a guide to the path of this happiness. That is beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds, without which there is no happiness for the servant, and no salvation for him except by clinging to their cause. So whoever is blessed with knowledge and action has succeeded and gained, and whoever is deprived of knowledge and action is deprived of all good.",

There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise} [Al Imran: 18]. And for the people of knowledge, Allah facilitates the easiest paths to Paradise, and the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, even the fish in the sea, ask forgiveness for them, as proven in the Hadith of Abu Darda on the authority of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, who said: «Whoever follows a path seeking knowledge therein, Allah will pave for him a path to Paradise. Indeed, the angels lower their wings in approval of the student of knowledge. And indeed, the scholar, those in the heavens and those on earth ask forgiveness for him, even the fish in the water. The superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like the superiority of the moon on the night of the full moon over all other stars. Indeed, the scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, and the Prophets did not leave behind a Dinar or a Dirham, but they left behind knowledge. So whoever takes it has taken an abundant share» (1). Through knowledge, laws and rulings are known, and the lawful is distinguished from the prohibited. Knowledge is the leader (Imam) and action is the follower (Ma'mum); it is a commander and action is a subordinate. Revising knowledge is glorification (Tasbih), searching for it is Jihad, seeking it is an act of closeness to Allah Almighty, giving it is charity, and studying knowledge is equivalent to fasting and night prayer. The need for it is greater than the need for drink and food. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, said: «People are more in need of knowledge than they are of food and drink; because food and drink are needed once or twice a day, but knowledge is needed",

    "text": "at every moment» (1). For this reason, knowing knowledge and action was one of the most obligatory duties upon servants, by which is their salvation and happiness in this world and the Hereafter. A very important warning must be given to the student of knowledge: Knowledge is the greatest worship, and Allah has not been worshipped with anything greater than knowledge. Acting upon knowledge is the fruit of knowledge and cognition. Knowledge is like the tree and acting upon it is its fruit. Whoever acts upon what he knows, Allah Almighty bequeaths him knowledge of what he did not know, as He Almighty said: {And if We had decreed upon them, \"Kill yourselves\" or \"Leave your homes,\" they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But if they had done what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith]. (66) And then We would have given them from Us a great reward. (67) And We would have guided them to a straight path} [An-Nisa: 66-68]. So whoever Allah wants good, happiness, salvation, and high status for in this world and the Hereafter, He facilitates for him beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds, as proven in the two Sahihs from the Hadith of Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: «Whomever Allah wills good for, He gives him understanding in the religion» (2). Ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, said: «The implication of the Hadith is that whoever does not gain understanding in religion, meaning does not learn the rules of Islam and the branches connected to them, has been deprived of good; because whoever does not know the matters of his religion is neither a Faqih (jurist) nor a student of Fiqh, so it is valid to describe him as one for whom",

    "text": "First: The Science of Tafsir (Exegesis): The science of Tafsir occupies the forefront among Sharia sciences; because understanding the meanings of the Quran is a necessary matter for the reader of the Quran and the one seeking understanding in religion. The science of Tafsir is one of the most important sciences that a student of knowledge should care for, since the honor of a science is by the honor of the known subject. Reflect on what Sheikh Al-Islam said at the end of his life when he regretted not dedicating most of his time to the Quran. He said, may Allah have mercy on him: «Allah has opened for me in this time, from the meanings of the Quran and from the principles of knowledge, things that many scholars would wish for, and I regretted wasting most of my time on other than the meanings of the Quran» (1). Definition of Tafsir: Tafsir linguistically: A noun derived from 'Fassara' - with the doubling of the Sin - taken from 'Al-Fasr': which is uncovering, clarification, and explanation. From that is His saying Almighty: {And they do not come to you with an argument except that We bring you the truth and the best explanation (Tafsira)} [Al-Furqan: 33]. Technically: A science by which the understanding of the Book of Allah Almighty revealed to Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, is known, and the clarification of its meanings, and the extraction of its rulings and wisdoms. Divisions of Tafsir: The science of Tafsir varies according to the consideration upon which it was divided; because Tafsir has several divisions based on different considerations. The most important of these divisions is dividing it according to the trends of the commentators (Mufassirin). According to this consideration, it can be divided into three sections:",

It is the best section of Tafsir, if it is free from weak Hadiths and Israelite narrations (Isra'iliyyat). Among the books of Tafsir bi-al-Ma'thur: 1) Jami' al-Bayan, by Abu Ja'far Muhammad bin Jarir al-Tabari, died in the year (310 AH). 2) Tafsir al-Quran al-Azim, by Abd al-Rahman bin Abi Hatim, died in the year (327 AH). 3) Tafsir al-Quran al-Azim, by Ismail bin Umar bin Kathir, died in the year (774 AH). Second: Tafsir bi-al-Ra'y wal-Ijtihad (Interpretation by Opinion and Reasoning/Knowledge): This section is of two types: Permissible and Blameworthy. As for the Permissible: It is striving (Ijtihad) to interpret what has no established transmitted text or narrated tradition, according to known conditions. As for the Blameworthy, it is the opposite of that. Like commentaries written to support innovations in beliefs, or commentaries that have no sound basis. Among the books of Tafsir bi-al-Ra'y: 1) Mafatih al-Ghayb, by Muhammad bin Umar Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, died in the year (606 AH). 2) Anwar al-Tanzil, by Abdullah bin Umar al-Baydawi, died in the year (685 AH). 3) Lubab al-Ta'wil, by Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Muhammad al-Khazin, died in the year (741 AH). Third: Al-Tafsir Al-Ishari (Indicative Interpretation): It is interpreting the Quran unlike its apparent meaning for a hidden sign that the Batinis and Sufis believe appears to them.

It is either an incident that occurs so the Quran is revealed because of it, or a question addressed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, so the Quran is revealed clarifying the ruling on it.

They were called (Isra'iliyyat) by predominance, because most of them are from the news of the Children of Israel or from their books. Decisive Verses (Ayat Muhkamat): Are the verses with clear meaning that do not bear more than one facet of interpretation. Ambiguous Verses (Ayat Mutashabihat): Are the verses that bear more than one facet of interpretation. Readings (Qira'at): Plural of Qira'ah, which is a school of thought adopted by one of the Imams of the Reciters, differing from others in pronunciation of the Holy Quran, with agreement of narrations and paths from him. Abrogation (Naskh): Is the lifting of a legal ruling by another legal evidence that comes after it. Abrogated Verses (Ayat Mansukha): Are of three types: 1) Verses whose recitation and ruling were abrogated. Example: Abrogation of prohibition of breastfeeding from ten sucklings to five. On the authority of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: «Among what was revealed of the Quran was: Ten known sucklings prohibit [marriage], then they were abrogated by five known ones.

It is derived from the two revelations: the Book and the Sunnah, and clarifies the approach of the Imams of the Ummah from the Companions and Followers, may Allah be pleased with them, in their dealing with issues of belief. The science of Aqidah is the root of sciences; because a person's safety in his religion depends on the soundness of his creed. Islamic Aqidah, when used generally, is the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah; because it is the Islam that Allah was pleased with as a religion for His servants, and it is the creed of the three favored generations of the Companions, the Followers, and those who followed them in goodness until the Day of Judgment. Everything that contradicts the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah is from false beliefs, and its holder has deviated from the correct belief to deviant heretical beliefs. The intended meaning of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah: Everyone who followed the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and held fast to it in word, deed, and belief. Definition of Aqidah: Aqidah linguistically: Taken from Al-'Aqd (tying), which is tightening, binding, firmness, and consolidation. It is said: He tied ('Aqada) the rope, tying it ('Ya'qiduhu'): he tightened it. And 'Al-'Aqd' is the opposite of dissolving. Aqidah is applied to firm faith that is not infiltrated by doubt. It is what a person believes in and ties his heart to.

Fruit of studying the science of Aqidah and its benefit: 1. Knowing the correct creed which is the root of religion, and the foundation of the call of the Messengers.

Knowing that correct creed is a condition for the validity of deeds and their acceptance. 3. Knowing the greatest and most confirmed duties is the Tawhid (Monotheism) of Allah Almighty, and distancing from what contradicts it of associating partners with Allah (Shirk) and the like. 4.

Haram (Forbidden): What the Sharia demanded us to leave with a decisive leaving, such that reward results from leaving it in compliance with Allah's command, and punishment results from doing it. Makruh (Disliked): What the Lawgiver demanded to be left with a non-decisive demand, such that if we leave it in compliance with Allah Almighty's command we are rewarded for it, and if we do it we are not punished. Ada' (Performance): Doing the act of worship in the time limited for it by the Sharia. Qada' (Making Up): Doing the act of worship that became obligatory outside the time defined for it by the Sharia. I'adah (Repetition): Doing the act of worship in its time a second time for increased virtue.",

    "text": "Fifth: Principles of Jurisprudence (Usul al-Fiqh): The science of Usul al-Fiqh: is among the most majestic sciences in value and greatest in importance, as it is the science considered by scholars as a basis for establishing proofs, refining issues, and deriving Sharia rulings. Its status in Sharia sciences is great as understanding rulings and knowing their causes relates to it. Definition of Usul al-Fiqh: Usul: Plural of Asl (Root/Origin). Asl in language: What something else is built upon. Usul al-Fiqh technically: Is the science that investigates general jurisprudential evidences, how to benefit from them, and the condition of the beneficiary. Divisions of Usul al-Fiqh: The topics of Usul al-Fiqh are divided into four main sections: 1. Explanation of Rulings: Such as prohibition, dislike, obligation, recommendation, permissibility, condition, impediment, and cause. And validity and invalidity, etc. 2. Study of Evidences: Such as the Book, the Sunnah, Consensus (Ijma'), Analogy (Qiyas), Juristic Preference (Istihsan), Presumption of Continuity (Istishab), Statement of a Companion, Blocking the Means (Sadd al-Dhara'i), and Public Interest (Maslahah Mursalah). 3. Modes of Indication of Evidences: Specific and General, Ambiguous and Clarified, Absolute and Restricted, Command and Prohibition, Abrogating and Abrogated, and the like. 4. Condition of the Deductor and the One Deducted For: These are the conditions of the Mujtahid and conditions of Ijtihad, rulings of following and followers, and rulings of imitation (Taqlid) and imitators.",

    "text": "Fruit of studying the science of Usul al-Fiqh and its benefits: 1) It gives the learner strength in deriving Sharia rulings from subsidiary evidences. 2) Facilitating the process of Ijtihad and giving new occurrences their appropriate rulings. 3) Knowing the controls of Fatwa, and the conditions and etiquette of the Mufti. 4) Protecting Islamic jurisprudence from openness resulting from establishing new sources of legislation, and from rigidity resulting from the claim of closing the door of Ijtihad. 5) Controlling the rules of dialogue and debate, by referring to authentic considered evidences. 6) Recognizing the tolerance and ease of Islamic Sharia, and viewing the beauties of this religion. 7) Clarifying methods of reconciling evidences that seemingly contradict, and refuting the doubts of detractors regarding that. 8) Preserving Islamic Sharia, because the science of Usul al-Fiqh safeguards the evidences of legislation so people do not transgress them, just as it preserves for rulings their arguments and documents, and clarifies the original and subsidiary sources of legislation so that the Sharia retains its rules. 9) Preventing the interpretation of texts of the Book and Sunnah according to opinion or desire. The science of Usul al-Fiqh controls the interpretation of texts, and governs it with comprehensive universal controls and rules agreed upon that refute every transgressor.",

Through it, the school of Hadith and Athar and the school of Ahl al-Ra'y (People of Opinion) were united. 11) Acquiring the jurisprudential faculty (Malakah) that enables the student of knowledge or jurist to understand correctly, fully and comprehensively perceive jurisprudential rulings, view methods of deduction and Ijtihad to benefit from them, and use analogy based on them if needed. 12) Removing sectarian fanaticism among jurists, where the student of knowledge can, through studying Usul al-Fiqh, balance between schools and jurisprudential opinions, and know the most likely, correct, and most worthy of acceptance, based on evidence and fundamental rules. Terminology of the Science of Usul al-Fiqh: Ijtihad: Is expending effort in extracting rulings from their evidences indicating them by looking into that which leads to them. Ijma' (Consensus): Is the agreement of the Mujtahids of the Ummah after the death of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, in any era, on a Sharia ruling. Qiyas (Analogy): Referring a branch to an origin in a specific ruling, due to a common cause between them. Shar' man qablana (Laws of those before us): Are the rulings transmitted to us in the Quran or established Sunnah that were laws for previous nations, like the People of the Book and others.",

    "text": "Urf (Custom): Is what most people are familiar with, and agree upon in actions, and there is no Sharia evidence negating or affirming it. Sadd al-Dhara'i (Blocking the Means): Cutting off the substance of means to corruption by preventing these means and repelling them. Example: Forbidding Muslims from insulting the gods of polytheists for fear that the polytheists would respond by insulting Allah Almighty. This prohibition came in His saying: {And do not insult those they invoke other than Allah, lest they insult Allah in enmity without knowledge} [Al-An'am: 108]. Al-Maslahah Al-Mursalah (Public Interest): Is every interest for which no specific evidence has come from the Lawgiver indicating its consideration or cancellation, and was consistent with the objectives of the Lawgiver. Example: Compiling the Quran in one Mushaf. The Companions agreed on it and there was no text for it, but the interest of preserving the religion required it. Sabab (Cause): What necessitates existence from its existence, and non-existence from its non-existence essentially. It is what something else is linked to in existence and non-existence; so existence of the effect follows from existence of the cause, and non-existence of the effect follows from non-existence of the cause, due to the cause itself. Example: Marriage is a cause for inheritance. Existence of inheritance between spouses follows from existence of marriage, and non-existence of inheritance follows from non-existence of marriage, due to the cause itself; because marriage might exist but the effect (inheritance) fails due to the presence of an impediment, like difference of religion. Shart (Condition): What necessitates non-existence from its non-existence, but existence nor non-existence does not necessitate from its existence essentially. It is what something else is linked to in non-existence not existence. If the condition is absent the ruling is absent, but if the condition is present the ruling might exist or might not.",

    "text": "Example: Purification is a condition; invalidity of prayer follows from its absence, but validity of prayer does not necessarily follow from its presence; because purity might exist (ritual impurity lifted) but another condition fails, preventing the validity of prayer. Mani' (Impediment): What necessitates non-existence from its existence, and neither existence nor non-existence necessitates from its non-existence essentially. It is what something else is linked to in existence not non-existence. If the impediment is found, the ruling is absent, and neither existence nor non-existence of the ruling necessitates from its absence essentially. Example: If menstruation is found, the validity of prayer is non-existent, but the validity of prayer does not necessarily follow from the absence of menstruation; because another impediment might exist. Amr (Command): Is requesting an action by speech from a position of superiority. Our saying: (from a position of superiority) means: that the command came from the higher to the lower. Example: His saying Almighty: {And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow} ... [Al-Baqarah: 43]. In the verse, Allah commanded His servants to pray and give Zakat. The direction of superiority here: The Highest is Allah Almighty, and the lowest are the servants. Nahy (Prohibition): Is the speech requesting abstention from a position of superiority. Example: His saying Almighty: {O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated} [An-Nisa: 43]. Aam (General): Is the term encompassing all its individuals without restriction. Khas (Specific): Is the term indicating a restricted number. Example of General and Specific: {And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way} [Al Imran: 97]. His saying: {And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House} is general including all people,",

    "text": "and His saying: {for whoever is able to find thereto a way} specified this generality with a description, which is the description of ability. Mutlaq (Absolute/Unrestricted): Is the term indicating the reality/essence without restriction. Example: His saying Almighty regarding expiation for Zihar: {And those who pronounce thihar from their wives and then [wish to] go back on what they said - then [there must be] the freeing of a slave before they touch one another} [Al-Mujadila: 3]. Here, freeing any slave was mentioned in the expiation, whether believing or disbelieving. Muqayyad (Restricted): Is the term indicating the reality/essence with a restriction; such as unity, description, condition, time, place, or others. Example: His saying Almighty regarding expiation for accidental killing: {And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the freeing of a believing slave} [An-Nisa: 92]. Here, a restriction was mentioned for the slave in the expiation, which is that he must be a believer, not just any slave. Mantuq (Explicit/Spoken Meaning): Is what the wording indicates in the place of utterance. It is the meaning derived from the wording in terms of it being spoken. Mafhum (Implied/Understood Meaning): Is what the wording indicates in other than the place of utterance. It is a meaning understood and derived from the wording. Example of Explicit and Implied: {So do not say to them [parents] \"uff\"} [Al-Isra: 23]. The explicit meaning of the verse is the prohibition of saying \"uff\" to parents, which is uttering \"uff\". The implied meaning of the verse is the prohibition of hitting and cursing. These are the most prominent terms related to the science of Usul al-Fiqh.",
