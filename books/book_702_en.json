    "text": "(Weak) From the Prophet (peace be upon him) who said: \"There is no one who fasts the first Thursday of Rajab and then prays between Isha and Atamah (late night) twelve Rak'ahs, separating every two Rak'ahs with a Taslim (salutation), reciting in every Rak'ah Fatihat al-Kitab (The Opening of the Book) once, 'Inna Anzalnahu fi Laylat al-Qadr' (Indeed, We sent it down in the Night of Decree) three times, and 'Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad' (Say, He is Allah, One) twelve times. When he finishes his prayer, he sends blessings upon me seventy times, saying: 'O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, the Unlettered Prophet, and upon his family.' Then he prostrates and says in his prostration seventy times: 'Subbuhun Quddus, Rabbul-Mala'ikati war-Ruh' (Glorified, Holy, Lord of the Angels and the Spirit). Then he raises his head and says seventy times: 'Rabbighfir warham wa tajawaz 'amma ta'lam, innaka Anta al-A'azzu al-Akram' (My Lord, forgive and have mercy and overlook what You know, indeed You are the Most Mighty, the Most Generous). Then he prostrates another prostration and says in it the same as he said in the first prostration. Then he asks for his need in his prostration, and it will be granted.\" The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: \"No one prays this prayer except that Allah Almighty forgives him all his sins, even if they were like the foam of the sea, the number of sand grains, the weight of mountains, and the leaves of trees. And he will intercede on the Day of Resurrection for seven hundred of his family members who deserved the Fire.\"",
