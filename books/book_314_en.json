    "text": "And after: When I decided to reprint my book \"Hijab al-Mar'ah al-Muslimah\" (The Veil of the Muslim Woman) - after several years had passed and it had been printed several times via offset photography - I saw that I must review it again, hoping I might be inspired to add new benefits to it, in addition to what had accumulated with me over time. I placed each item in my copy in its proper place over the days, and corrected inevitable typographical or intellectual errors that hardly any book escapes. I paid special attention to reading the books and treatises authored in this era regarding women - which number in the dozens - that had gathered with me. I found most of them had followed one another in refuting me, some directly naming the book and its author, and some addressing the issue directly without mentioning my person. This is the issue regarding which one of the doctors claimed that I was unique in asserting it, to the exclusion of those before me among the scholars of the Salaf (predecessors) and the Khalaf (successors); namely: that the woman's face is not 'Awrah (private parts to be concealed) and that it is not obligatory for her to cover it. I saw - by Allah - a great wonder in their consensus on the statement of obligation (Wujub), their imitation (Taqlid) of one another in that, their method of inferring evidence from narration (Riwayah) or understanding (Dirayah) that is not authentic, and their interpretation of texts that contradict them from the Salafi tracks (Athar) and the famous sayings of some of the followed Imams, ignoring them as if they were nothing mentioned. This made me feel that all of them - regrettably - wrote what they wrote while surrendering to human emotions, personal impulses, and local traditions, not in submission to the legal (Sharia) evidences. For the evidences they mentioned [6]\n\n- according to their school of thought (Madhhab) - they know very well were not hidden from me, because they saw them in my book along with the answers to them and the deduction using evidence that contradicts them, which is more authentic to us than their deductions they clung to. Just as they know that I do not deny the legitimacy of the researches: However, it is necessary to point out the most important researches that I dealt with in the Introduction referred to (1), summarizing the discussion therein as much as possible.

This is contrary to the meaning of the root of this word: \"Al-Idna'\" in the language, which is \"bringing close\" (Al-Taqreeb), as I had mentioned and explained in the Book (1) - as will appear in its place therein - and I clarified that it is not a textual stipulation for covering the face, and that the opponents must bring forth what makes their view preponderant. This is something they have not done and will not be able to do, except for defaming those who oppose them among those who followed the Salaf of the Ummah, their exegetes (Mufassirin), and their scholars.

And this is how the Interpreter of the Qur'an, Abdullah bin Abbas, interpreted it in what is authentically reported from him, for he said: \"She draws the Jilbab close to her face but does not strike [cover] with it,\" as its extraction (Takhrij) will come later. Here is Sheikh At-Tuwayjiri - may Allah guide us and him - saying at the end of his mentioned book (p. 249): \"And whoever permits Sufoor (uncovering the face) for women (meaning uncovering the face only) - and uses as evidence the likes of what Al-Albani used - has indeed opened the door of Tabarruj (display of beauty) wide open and emboldened women to commit the reprehensible acts that uncovered women do today.\" Thus he said - may Allah reform and guide him - for this attack and defamation does not affect me alone, but also strikes those who are my role models and predecessors (Salaf) among the Companions, the Tabi'in, the exegetes, the jurists, and others - whom we mentioned in the Book - as will come, and in the Introduction referred to as well. Suffice for me now one example from them, which is what came in \"Al-Insaf fi Ma'rifat Ar-Rajih min Al-Khilaf 'ala Madhhab Al-Imam Al-Mubajjal Ahmad ibn Hanbal\" by Sheikh Ala' al-Din al-Mirdawi (1 / 452): \"The correct view of the Madhhabs is that the face is not part of the 'Awrah.\" Then he mentioned the same regarding the hands. It is the choice of Ibn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi in \"Al-Mughni\" (1 / 637), and he used as evidence for his choice the prohibition of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, for the woman in Ihram to wear gloves and the Niqab, and said: [8]",

    "text": "\"If the face and hands were 'Awrah, covering them would not have been forbidden. And because the need calls for uncovering the face for buying and selling, and the hands for taking and giving.\" This is what he relied upon and asserted in his book \"Al-Umdah\" (66). So what is the opinion of Sheikh At-Tuwayjiri regarding this text from this glorious Hanbali Imam? Do you think he is a caller to Sufoor as well and an opener of the door of Tabarruj wide open and...? Do you not fear, O Sheikh, that the threat of his saying, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, might encompass you: (Authentic) \"Indeed, a servant may speak a word, not clarifying it (its implications), by which he falls into the Fire farther than the distance between the East and the West.\" Extracted by the two Sheikhs (Bukhari and Muslim) from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, and it is extracted in \"As-Sahihah\" (2 / 540). If the Sheikh - may Allah guide him - had presented his opinion to the people and defended it with authentic Sharia evidences, we would have said: Welcome to it, whether he was right or wrong. But for him to unleash his \"Rigorous Sword\" (Sarim) upon those who opposed him in his opinion and use it to defame even the \"Glass Vessels\" (women) - whom the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, commanded to be treated gently - merely because they disagreed with him and followed the correct view of his \"Madhhab\" which he turned away from due to an obsession that overcame him, then this is a moral calamity and another doctrinal violation. For Imam Ahmad, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him, said: \"It is not appropriate for a jurist to compel people to his Madhhab\" (1).",

    "text": "The Second Research: Many of the strict opponents claim: That the (Jilbab) commanded in the verse of Al-Ahzab is synonymous with the (Hijab) mentioned in the other verse: ({And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition (Hijab)}) [Al-Ahzab: 53]. This is a strange confusion driven by their knowledge that the first verse contains no evidence that the face and hands are 'Awrah, unlike the other one, for it concerns the woman while she is in her home, as she is not usually wearing a Jilbab or Khimar inside, so she does not appear to the asker, contrary to what some women do today who have no morals. Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah drew attention to this difference, saying in \"Al-Fatawa\" (15 / 448): \"So the verse of the Jilbabs is regarding outer garments when emerging from the dwellings, and the verse of the Hijab is regarding conversing inside the dwellings.\" I say: There is nothing in either of the two verses that indicates the obligation of covering the face and hands. As for the first, it is because the Jilbab is the sheet that a woman wraps herself with over her clothes - and not over her face - as is mentioned later in the Book (p. 83). Upon this constitute all the books of language; there is no mention of the face in any of them at all. It has been authentically reported from Ibn Abbas that he said in its interpretation: \"She draws the Jilbab close to her face but does not strike [cover] with it.\" Extracted by Abu Dawood in his \"Masa'il\" (p. 110). Anything contradicting it is either Shadh (irregular) or Da'if (weak). The detail is in that Introduction [10]",

    "text": "As for the other verse, it is for what I mentioned previously. For this reason, it appeared to me to make the title of the book: \"Jilbab Al-Mar'ah...\" (The Jilbab of the Woman...) because it is more pertinent to the subject of the book, as is apparent. And Allah the Exalted is the Granter of success.\n\nThe Third Research: Among their contradictions is that - while they obligate the woman to cover her face - they permit her to uncover her left eye, and some were lenient and said: both eyes, based on some flimsy traces (Athar), among which is the Hadith of Ibn Abbas coming in the Book (p. 88). However, what contradicts it has been narrated from him with the wording: \"And bringing down the Jilbab is that she puts it on as a veil (taqanna') and tightens it on her forehead.\" This is the textual proof of our saying: That it does not include the face. Therefore, all the opponents concealed it and did not mention it, even though it has a weak chain, but it has witnessing reports as will come. Truthful is he who said: The People of Sunnah mention what is for them and what is against them, and the People of Desires mention what is for them and do not mention what is against them. From that is that Sheikh Abdul Qadir Al-Sindi concealed in his treatise \"Al-Hijab\" one of the two defects of the first report of Ibn Abbas and downplayed the significance of the other (p. 19 - 20). The author of \"Ya Fatat al-Islam\" was deceived by him and declared its authenticity (p. 252), and likewise the author of \"Fiqh al-Nazar fi al-Islam\" authenticated it (p. 65). Worse than that is what the one named (Darwish) did in what he called \"Fasl al-Khitab\", where he changed its chain of transmission in two places (46 and 82), making it from the narration of Muhammad bin Sirin from Ibn Abbas. This is a sheer fabrication with no basis [11]",

    "text": "from this narration. I do not know if this was intentional on his part or an oversight? I would have liked to lean towards the first of the two, had I not seen another fabrication of his (p. 82) which I might point out on another occasion, Allah the Exalted willing. It seems to me that they - feeling the weakness of their argument deep in their souls - resort to using opinion and the language of emotions - or what resembles philosophy - saying: \"The most beautiful thing in a woman is her face, so it is unreasonable that it is permissible for her to uncover it.\" It was said to them: \"And the most beautiful thing in the face is the eyes, so blind them then, and order her to cover them with her Jilbab.\" It was said to them by way of opposition: \"And the most beautiful thing in a man - regarding the woman - is his face, so order the men also - by this philosophy of yours - to cover their faces as well in front of women, especially those among them of surpassing beauty,\" as reported in the biography of Abu Al-Hasan the Preacher known as (Al-Masri): \"He had a gathering where he spoke and preached, and men and women attended his preaching gathering. He used to place a Burqa (veil) over his face, fearing that women would be tempted by the beauty of his face.\" \"Tarikh Baghdad\" (12 / 75 - 76). So what does the virtuous Sheikh At-Tuwayjiri say - and those who run behind him among the philosophizers - is what this Egyptian did legislated (mashru') or not? Knowing that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was more beautiful than him and did not do his deed. If you say it is legislated, you have opposed the Sunnah of your Prophet and have gone astray, and this is not what we hope for you. And if you say it is not - as is expected of you - you are correct, and your philosophy is void, and you must retract it and suffice in your refutation of me with the evidences [12]",

    "text": "of the Sharia if you have them, for they suffice you against embellished speech. Otherwise, you crowd yourselves among the (People of Opinion/Ra'y), as Ahmad narrated in \"Al-'Ilal\" (2 / 246) from Hammad bin Salamah who said: \"Abu Hanifa received the Athar (traces) and Sunan (traditions) and rejected them with his opinion.\"\n\nThe Fourth Research: The Khimar and I'tijar and His saying Almighty: ({and to draw their headcovers (Khumur) over their chests (Juyub)}) [An-Nur: 31]. We mentioned later in the Book (p. 72) that the Khimar is: The covering of the head only, excluding the face. I cited the words of some scholars as evidence for that: such as Ibn Al-Athir and Ibn Kathir. But Sheikh At-Tuwayjiri - and those who followed him among the adherents of Madhhabs and imitators - refused that and insisted that it includes the face as well, and repeated that in various places. They clung in that to some statements that amount to no more than a scholar's slip, or a slip of the pen, or at best an interpretation of intent and not an interpretation of the word, which should not be relied upon in the place of dispute and disagreement (1). At the same time, he turned away from the definitive evidences from the Book and the Sunnah and the sayings of the scholars and Imams from the exegetes, Muhaddithin, jurists, and linguists contradicting him, some of which appeared in his own book, but he passed over them and concealed their indication with deep regret. For instance, when he cited the verse: ({And women of post-menstrual age who have no desire for marriage - there is no blame upon them for putting aside their outer garments...}) [An-Nur: 60] the verse, and spoke about it for about two pages (161 - 163) with useful speech, but he did not clarify to his readers what is meant by the quotes he mentioned in interpreting: (their garments / thiyabahunna) as being the Jilbab. Among them his saying: Abu Salih said: She puts aside the Jilbab and stands before the man in the Dir' (chemise) and the Khimar. And Sa'id bin Jubayr said: There is no harm for her to lay aside [garments] in the presence of a stranger or others, provided there is a thick Khimar upon her. A group of Hanbalis and others stated this explicitly. Ibn Al-Jawzi mentioned in \"Zad Al-Masir\" (6 / 63) from Abu Ya'la - meaning: the Hanbali Judge - that he said: In this verse is evidence that it is permissible for the old woman to uncover her face and hands before men. Similar is in Ahkam Al-Quran by Al-Jassas (3 / 334). Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah indicated this meaning in \"Tafsir Surat An-Nur\" (p. 57) and At-Tuwayjiri quoted it (167) using it as proof. All of this indicates that these virtuous scholars of the Salaf and Khalaf view that the Khimar does not cover the face, but rather the head only, as is our saying. Whoever contemplates some of the Sheikh's labored answers will be certain that he sees this with us, but he argues, stubbornly resists, and conceals. Look, for example, at his answer regarding the hadith of Jabir coming in the Book (p. 60) which contains: \"That he saw a woman with darkening on her cheeks\" [14]",

    "text": "narrated without his saying: \"That he saw a woman...\" until the end. So the Sheikh answered (p. 208) with the possibility that \"that woman was of post-menstrual age...\" meaning: so uncovering her face is permissible, as explicitly stated by Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen in his \"Risalah\" (p. 32). As for At-Tuwayjiri, he speaks in riddles and obscures, and does not clarify to his reader. So is this answer valid from the Sheikh while he insists that the Khimar covers the face as well? May Allah guide you. Know that the purpose of mentioning this verse of (The Post-Menstrual Women) is only to establish the argument against the Sheikh using what he adopted of the scholars' sayings in interpreting: (their garments) as being the (Jilbab) and that it is permissible for (The Post-Menstrual Women) to appear with her Khimar \"in the presence of foreign men\" seeing her face. The meaning of this according to them - and the Sheikh is a follower of them in this - is that the Khimar linguistically does not cover the face. This alone is sufficient as an argument against the Sheikh, may Allah the Exalted guide him. How then if there is added to that what will come from the Sunnah and the sayings of the scholars in every science, making the Sheikh contrary to their consensus and following other than their path? I say this to remind that there is another saying in interpreting: (their garments) - which I had mentioned in its place in the Book - which is the Khimar, and it is the more authentic view from Ibn Abbas as will come (p. 110 - 111). The Sheikh concealed this saying as is his habit regarding what does not agree with his desire, contrary to the People of Sunnah who mention what is for them and what is against them as preceded. Since he has chosen the first saying, which is (the Jilbab), he is required to say that (the Khimar) does not cover the face, and that is the intent. Ibn al-Qattan al-Fasi chose the other saying in \"Al-Nazar fi Ahkam Al-Nazar\", saying (Folio 35 / 2): [15]",

How many errors he has in it, indicated by what is in the book itself, such as his saying in the index of the fourth volume (418) \"Covering the face for women is obligatory.\" I truly fear that this was intentional from him to promote the book among the Saudi Sheikhs who say it is obligatory. \n[16].",

Similar to it is his saying, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, regarding the woman who vowed to perform Hajj bareheaded (hasirah): (Authentic) \"Order her to ride, to wear a Khimar, and to perform Hajj.\" And in a narration: \"and cover her hair.\" It is also authentic, I extracted it in \"Al-Ahadith As-Sahihah\" (2930). Does the Sheikh permit the woman in Ihram to strike her Khimar over her face while he knows his saying, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him: \"The woman in Ihram does not wear Niqab...\"? Similar to that are the hadiths of wiping over the Khimar in Wudu (ablution), performed by him, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and ordered for men and women. So who is the one who holds the Sheikh's opinion which contradicts the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and the sayings of the scholars as well, as preceded in the interpretation of the verse of the post-menstrual women? We have more as will come. From that is the saying of the erudite scholar Al-Zabidi in \"Sharh Al-Qamus\" (3 / 189) regarding the saying of Umm Salamah, may Allah be pleased with her: That she used to wipe over the Khimar. Extracted by Ibn Abi Shaybah in \"Al-Musannaf\" (1 / 22): She meant by (Al-Khimar): The Turban (Al-Imamah), because the man covers his head with it just as the woman covers it with her Khimar. [17]",

And from it is the Khimar of the woman, which is a cloth with which she covers her head. And from it is the Turban (Al-Imamah) because the man covers his head with it and winds it under the chin (tahneek). These are explicit texts from these scholars that the Khimar for the woman is like the Turban for the man. Just as the Turban when mentioned generally does not mean covering the man's face, likewise the Khimar when mentioned generally does not mean covering the woman's face with it. Upon this proceeded the scholars of various specializations among: Exegetes, Muhaddithin, Jurists, Linguists, and others, past and present. It was facilitated for me to stand upon the words of more than forty of them; I mentioned their texts in the research referred to in the Introduction, and all of them agreed on mentioning the head without the face in their definition of the Khimar.

He truncated from Al-Hafiz's explanation the text of his mentioned speech because it contradicted his claim. For Al-Hafiz said in explaining Aisha's saying at the end of her hadith: \"So they covered themselves (fakhtamarna) with them\" (8 / 490): \"Meaning: They covered their faces. And the description of that is that she puts the Khimar on her head and throws it from the left side, which is masking (Taqannu'). Al-Farra' said: In Jahiliyyah, the woman used to let her Khimar hang down behind her and uncover what was in front of her, so they were ordered to cover and (Khimar)...\" to the end of the text. So I say: The Sheikh refuted in his book (p. 221) my statement which agrees with the people of knowledge - as you knew - using the mentioned interpretation of Al-Hafiz: \"Covered their faces,\" and he ignored the completion of his speech which is explicit that he does not mean what the Sheikh understood, because it contradicts his saying: [19]",

    "text": "\"And the description of that...\" for if the Sheikh applied this with his Khimar, he would find his face uncovered, not covered. This is confirmed by the text which the Sheikh truncated, intentionally or by imitation, which contains Al-Hafiz's comparison of the woman's Khimar to the man's turban. So does the Sheikh see that the Turban also - like the Khimar in his view - covers the head and face together? Likewise his saying: \"Which is masking (Taqannu')\". For in the books of language: A woman did 'taqannu'' means: she wore the Qina' (mask/veil), which is what a woman covers her head with, as in \"Al-Mu'jam Al-Wasit\" and others like Al-Hafiz himself. For he said in \"Al-Fath\" (7 / 230 and 10 / 274): \"Taqannu': Covering the head.\" I only said: \"or by imitation,\" because I hold the Sheikh above relying on such truncation that changes the intended meaning of the speech, for I found one of the contemporary virtuous men who preceded him in this, but he has moved to Allah's mercy and pardon, so I do not wish to debate him. May Allah forgive us and him. Based on the foregoing, his saying: \"their faces\" could possibly be an error from the copyist or a slip of the pen from the author, intending to say: \"their chests\" but the pen slipped. It could also possibly be that he intended a metaphorical meaning, i.e., what surrounds the face, by way of [20]",

And that with which one covers is called: (Khimar). But (Al-Khimar) became in common usage a name for what a woman covers her head with, and its plural is (Khumur). Allah Almighty said: (and to draw their headcovers (Khumur) over their chests).\" And Ibn Manzur (d. 711), Al-Fayruzabadi (816), and a group of scholars who authored \"Al-Mu'jam Al-Wasit\" - as preceded - with the text of their explicit saying that it is the headcover. Because of these quotes from these stalwart Imams, the virtuous Sheikh Muhammad bin Salih bin Uthaymeen had no choice but to differ from the Sheikh in his fanaticism for his opinion and agree with these Imams. He said in his treatise (p. 6): \"(Al-Khimar): What a woman veils her head with and covers it with, like the (Ghadfah) (1).\" I say: So by these evidences from the Book and the Sunnah and the sayings of the Imams of Tafsir, Hadith, Fiqh, and Language, our saying is established: That the Khimar is the headcover. And the saying of Sheikh At-Tuwayjiri and his imitators like Ibn Khalaf is invalidated, who claimed (p. 70) of his \"Nazarat\": That the Khimar is general for the name of the head and face linguistically and legally.

I used some hadiths as evidence for that, but they ignored them regrettably and could not give an answer. I add here saying: It came in the story of the hunger of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said about Umm Sulaym: (Authentic) \"So she brought out discs of barley bread, then she took out a Khimar of hers and wrapped the bread in part of it...\" The Hadith. Extracted by Al-Bukhari (3578) and Muslim (6 / 118) and others. The witness from it is clear, which is that the Khimar with which a woman covers her head was used by her to wrap bread and cover it. So does anyone say: That among the meanings of Khimar, if mentioned generally, is that it covers bread too? I do not rule out that those who dared to oppose those preceding texts from the Book, the Sunnah, and the sayings of the Imams indicating that (Al-Khimar) is the headcover without the circle of her face, might say that. So those people said: \"and her face.\" For no reason other than that it was used to cover the face like the Jilbab, even if occasionally. If you know this, then among the errors of At-Tuwayjiri - and those who run in his circle - is his saying after interpreting the Khimar with what has been proven wrong (p. 221): [23]",

I do not want to prolong quoting evidences for that from the words of the scholars, but I suffice here with what Imam Al-Fayruzabadi said in his \"Qamus\" and Al-Zabidi in his \"Taj\", placing the words of the first between parentheses. He said (3 / 383): \"(Al-I'tijar): Winding the garment on the head without passing it under the chin. And in some phrases: It is (winding the turban without Tahneek / passing under the chin). And it is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he entered Mecca on the day of the Conquest 'Mu'tajiran' (wearing an I'tijar) with a black turban\" (1). The meaning: He wound it on his head and did not pass it under his chin. And the Mi'jar (like Minbar: a garment with which one does I'tijar) for a woman is smaller than the Rida' (cloak) and larger than the Miqna'ah (veil). It is a garment the woman wraps on the circumference of her head then puts her Jilbab over it, like the 'Ijar. The plural: Al-Ma'ajir. And from it, I'tijar was derived with the previous meaning.\" I say: And this does not contradict what Sheikh At-Tuwayjiri argued for his claim by saying (p. 161):",

I'tijar with the turban: is that he wraps it on his head and returns its end over his face and does not make anything of it go under his chin. End quote.\" I say: This does not contradict what preceded from the language scholars regarding the explanation of (Al-I'tijar), because what Ibn Al-Athir said is explicitly stated in the hadith: \"Nothing was seen of him except his eyes.\" So it is a revealing description of (Al-I'tijar) and not inherent to it. Just as if someone said: (He came wearing a Khimar or a Turban, nothing was seen of him except his eyes). That does not mean to anyone who understands the language that among the necessities of Ikhtimar and Ta'ammum (wearing turban) is covering the face except the eyes. Therefore, Al-Hafiz did not add in \"Al-Fath\" (7 / 369) to his saying: \"(Mu'tajiran) i.e., winding his turban on his head without Tahneek (passing under the chin).\" The summary of the matter: Khimar and I'tijar when mentioned generally only mean: covering the head. So whoever adds covering the face to that is stubborn and obstinate against the preceding evidences. Accordingly, the inference of the Sheikh - and those who imitated him - using the hadiths that contain women wearing Khimar or I'tijar for his false claim religiously and linguistically falls. At the same time, our inference using the verse of (Al-Khimar) and the hadith of Fatimah coming on (p. 66) No. (5) that the woman's face is not 'Awrah stands valid, as will be explained there. And Allah is the One sought for help. (See the hadith of Aisha regarding the women Emigrants wearing Khimar later [25]",

    "text": "(Coming from the book page 78) The Fifth Discussion: Did the Muslims reach a consensus that the woman's face is 'Awrah and that she is prohibited from going out with her face unveiled? That is what Sheikh Al-Tuwaijri claimed - may Allah guide him, and some imitated him in that. He repeats this and reiterates it in many places and on numerous pages close to each other in his book; he does not tire nor bore (p. 156, 197, 217, 243, 245, and 247). He does this while knowing deep inside himself that there is no consensus on it, because he passes over the disagreement and does not report it, or he might report it and then ignore it, as will be clarified soon in a way that leaves no doubt about that. His speech regarding that differs in wording but agrees in meaning. It suffices me to quote from him only two texts for the sake of brevity: The First: His saying (p. 197 and 217) verbatim: 'And Ibn Raslan related: The agreement of the Muslims on preventing women from going out with unveiled faces. Al-Shawkani quoted it from him in (Nayl al-Awtar) (1).' So I say: Here is the text of what is in \"Nayl al-Awtar\" (6 / 98) - Al-Babi Al-Halabi [edition]) under the Hadith of Aisha:",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) And likewise Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen attributed it to him (p. 25), but he did not mention Ibn Raslan at all, so he gave the readers the impression that it was the saying of Al-Shawkani, even though he [Al-Shawkani] attributed it to Ibn Raslan and did not adopt it; rather he opined for the exception mentioned in the Hadith as will come from his explicit speech on that. \n[26].",

    "text": "\"O Asma, indeed when a woman reaches menstruation, it is not correct that anything be seen of her except this and this. And he pointed to his face and his hands\" (1): In it is evidence for those who say: It is permissible to look at a foreign woman. Ibn Raslan said: And this is when there is safety from Fitnah (temptation) regarding what desire calls for, such as intercourse or less than that. But when there is fear of Fitnah, the apparent general meaning of the verse and hadith is that necessity is not a condition. And what indicates restricting it to necessity is the agreement of Muslims on preventing women from going out with uncovered faces, especially when corrupt people are many. Al-Qadi Iyad related from the scholars: That it is not obligatory on her to cover her face in her path, and men must lower their gaze according to the verse. The disagreement on the root of the issue has preceded. I say: He refers to a research of his in the chapter preceding the aforementioned hadith of Aisha, where he explained the verse: ({and not to display their adornment except what is apparent thereof}) [An-Nur: 31] and quoted under it Al-Zamakhshari's interpretation of adornment in it, including his saying: \"So what was apparent of it like the ring, kohl, and dye, there is no harm in revealing it to strangers.\" Then Ash-Shawkani said following it: \"The result: That a woman reveals of the places of adornment what necessity calls for",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) Confirmation of its authenticity will come, Allah willing, in the Eighth Research (p. 79). \"during the practice of things, buying, selling, and giving testimony, so that would be an exception to the general prohibition of revealing places of adornment. This is assuming no Marfu' (Prophetic) interpretation has been narrated. And in the chapter following this one, there will come what indicates that the face and hands are among what is excepted.\" So contemplate, O noble reader, is the issue a matter of consensus as the Sheikh said first? And was he honest in his quotation of Ibn Raslan's speech and then Ash-Shawkani's speech second? Who adopted what the hadith of Aisha indicated, which we strengthened in the Book (p. 57 - 60), just as Majd al-Din Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) adopted it by titling it \"Chapter: That the woman is 'Awrah except the face and hands.\" As for the Sheikh, he weakened it with a stroke of a pen - as they say - and did not turn to the witnessing report, the practice of the Salaf, and the strengthening by Al-Hafiz Al-Bayhaqi and others as will come. So he closed his eyes to all of that out of arrogance, stubbornness, and insolence, and more than one of the imitating writers became entangled with him in this issue. And the other of his two texts: His saying in some of his answers (p. 243): \"The truth is with the Sheikhs who hold that the woman's face is 'Awrah which she is not allowed to uncover before foreign men, and their evidence for that is the Book, the Sunnah, and the Consensus.\" \n[28].",

    "text": "Invalidity of the Consensus he claimed: So I say, seeking help from Allah alone: No one from the people of knowledge has uttered the word \"Consensus\" in this issue, as far as I know and my knowledge encompasses, except this Sheikh. Nothing drove him to that except his strictness and fanaticism for his opinion and his closing of his eyes to everything that contradicts him from the texts. For the disagreement in it is old; no book specializing in discussing differences is devoid of it. Had I ample time, I would have authored a special treatise in which I would list what was facilitated for me of their sayings on this issue. But I must quote here some of them that indicate the invalidity of the consensus he claimed. So I say:\n\nThe First: Ibn Hazm said in his book \"Maratib Al-Ijma\" (p. 29) verbatim: \"And they agreed that the hair of the free woman and her body, except for her face and hands, are 'Awrah, and they disagreed regarding the face and hands, even their fingernails, are they 'Awrah or not?\" Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah approved this in his commentary on it and did not critique him as he did in some other places.\n\nThe Second: Ibn Hubayra Al-Hanbali said in \"Al-Ifsah\" (1 / 118 - Aleppo): \"And they disagreed regarding the 'Awrah of the free woman alone. Abu Hanifa said: All of her is 'Awrah except the face, the hands, and the feet. And it was narrated from him that her feet are 'Awrah. And Malik [29] and Al-Shafi'i said: All of her is 'Awrah except her face and hands. This is the saying of Ahmad in one of his two narrations. The other narration: All of her is 'Awrah except her face specifically. And this is the famous one and Al-Khiraqi chose it. He missed a third narration which is: That all of her is 'Awrah even her fingernail. As will come with the clarification of Ibn Abd al-Barr's refutation of it shortly.\n\nThe Third: It came in the book \"Al-Fiqh 'ala Al-Madhahib Al-Arba'a\" (Jurisprudence according to the Four Schools) authored by a committee of scholars including Al-Jaziri in the discussion of the limit of the woman's 'Awrah (1 / 167 - Second Edition): \"However, if she is in the presence of a foreign man or a non-Muslim woman, her 'Awrah is her entire body except the face and the hands, for they are not 'Awrah (1), so looking at them is permissible when there is safety from Fitnah.\" Then he excepted from that the Shafi'i Madhhab, and there is an apparent objection to this due to what preceded in \"Al-Ifsah\" and others of what preceded and will come.\n\nThe Fourth: Ibn Abd al-Barr said in \"Al-Tamhid\" (6 / 364) - having mentioned that the woman is all 'Awrah except the face and hands and that it is the saying of the Imams and their companions and the saying of Al-Awza'i and Abu Thawr -: [30]",

Abu Bakr bin Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith said: Everything of the woman even her fingernail.\" Then Ibn Abd al-Barr said: \"This is outside the sayings of the people of knowledge, because of the consensus of the scholars that a woman may pray the obligatory prayer with her hands and face uncovered; all of that from her touches the ground. And they agreed that she does not pray wearing a Niqab, nor is she required to wear gloves in prayer (1). In this, there are the clearest evidences that that is not 'Awrah and it is permissible for anyone who looks at her without suspicion or dislike to look at that from her. As for looking with desire, contemplating her over her clothes with desire is forbidden, so how about looking at her face while uncovered? Something similar to Abu Bakr's saying has been narrated from Ahmad bin Hanbal (2).\"\n\nI said: And I had quoted later in the book (p. 89) from Ibn Rushd: that the madhhab of the majority of scholars is that the face of the woman is not 'awrah (nakedness that must be covered), and from An-Nawawi similar to that, and that",

I say: This saying of Ahmad was narrated by Abu Dawood also in \"Masa'il Al-Imam Ahmad\" (p. 40) with the wording: \"When the woman prays, nothing is seen of her, not even her fingernail; she covers everything of herself.\" Sheikh At-Tuwayjiri adopted it in his book and paid no attention to the consensus mentioned by Ibn Abd al-Barr, upon which knowledge has been from the era of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until today. \n[31].\n\nNone",

As for the first matter, he quoted (p. 157) from Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir: that the majority interpreted the verse of adornment (Zinah) as the face and hands, and he repeated that (p. 234). As for the other matter, I have mentioned in more than one place in my book those among the scholars who held a view contrary to his alleged Consensus, such as Ibn Jarir, Ibn Rushd, and An-Nawawi, and among them is Ibn Battal (1), from whom I quoted later in the book (p. 63) that he used the hadith of the Khath'amiyyah woman as evidence that a woman covering her face is not obligatory.",

A quick glance at the statement of Ibn Battal mentioned above is sufficient to invalidate the answer of the Sheikh, may Allah guide him.

If she wants to cover her face, she should let down the garment (Sadl) from above her head cover (Khimar). This is the saying of Abu Hanifa and the generality of our jurists. And Abu Ja'far At-Tahawi said in \"Sharh Al-Ma'ani\" (2 / 392 - 393): It was permitted for people to look at what is not prohibited for them of women, at their faces and hands, and that was forbidden for them regarding the wives of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. This is the saying of Abu Hanifa, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on them. Second: The Madhhab of Malik: His companion Abdur-Rahman Ibn Al-Qasim Al-Misri narrated from him in \"Al-Mudawwanah\" (2 / 221) similar to the saying of Imam Muhammad regarding the Muhrima if she wants to let down [a cloth] over her face, and he added in clarification saying: But if she does not want to cover, she does not let it down. Ibn Abd al-Barr quoted it in \"Al-Tamhid\" (15 / 111) and approved of it, and said after mentioning the interpretation of Ibn Abbas and Ibn Umar for the verse: (except what appears thereof) [34]",

    "text": "as the face and hands (6 / 369): And upon the saying of Ibn Abbas and Ibn Umar are the jurists in this chapter. (He said:) This is what came regarding the woman and her ruling in covering in her prayer and other than her prayer. Reflect on his saying: \"and other than her prayer\". And in \"Al-Muwatta\", the narration of Yahya (2 / 935): Malik was asked: Does a woman eat with other than her Mahrams or with her servant boy? Malik said: There is no harm in that if it is in a manner in which it is known for a woman to eat with men. He said: And a woman may eat with her husband and with others who eat with him. Al-Baji said in \"Al-Muntaqa Sharh Al-Muwatta\" (7 / 252) following this text: It implies that a man looking at a woman's face and hands is permissible because that appears from her when she is eating. Third: The Madhhab of Shafi'i: He said in his book \"Al-Umm\" (2 / 185): The Muhrima does not cover (Tukhammir) her face unless she wants to cover her face, then she keeps it away [from the skin]. Al-Baghawi said in \"Sharh As-Sunnah\" (9 / 23): If she is a free foreign woman (Ajnabiyyah), then her entire body is 'awrah regarding a man; it is not permissible [35] for him to look at anything of it except the face and the hands up to the wrists, and he must lower his gaze from looking at her face and hands as well when there is fear of Fitnah (temptation). So are these texts - O Sheikh - regarding prayer? Fourth: The Madhhab of Ahmed: Ibn Salih narrated in his \"Masa'il\" (1 / 319) from him that he said: The Muhrima does not cover (Tukhammir) her face nor wear a Niqab, and letting down (Sadl) has no harm in it; she lets down [a cloth] over her face. I say: So his saying: \"has no harm in it\" indicates the permissibility of letting down (Sadl), so the Sheikh's claim of its obligation is invalidated, just as his restriction of the other narration from the Imam - which agrees with the saying of the three Imams that her face and hands are not 'awrah - is invalidated, as previously mentioned in the words of Ibn Hubayra. Ibn Taymiyyah affirmed it in \"Al-Fatawa\" (15 / 371), and it is the correct view of his Madhhab as previously mentioned from \"Al-Insaf\", and it is the choice of Ibn Qudamah as previously mentioned in \"The First Research\". He justified that by saying: If the face and hands were 'awrah, covering them with Niqab would not be forbidden [in Ihram], because the need calls for uncovering the face for selling and buying, and the hands for taking and giving. Such reasoning was mentioned in many Fiqh books and others, such as \"Al-Bahr Ar-Ra'iq\" by Ibn Nujaym Al-Misri (1 / 284), and similar was mentioned from Ash-Shawkani at the beginning of this \"Fifth Research\" (27) [36]",

From another angle, the saying of Malik in \"Al-Muwatta\" and the saying of Ibn Abd al-Barr: \"and other than her prayer\" indicate the invalidity of the mentioned interpretation of At-Tuwaijri, as well as the Imams giving the choice to the Muhrimas regarding Sadl (letting down the cloth), because that is outside of prayer. I want now to clarify to our virtuous readers a knowledge that those mentioned have concealed - or were ignorant of, and the sweeter of the two is bitter - that the predecessor (Salaf) of the Imams, may Allah have mercy on them - in what preceded - is the Mother of the Believers, Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, in word and deed. As for the word: It is: (Authentic/Sahih) \"The Muhrima may wear whatever she wishes of clothes except a garment touched by Wars or Saffron, and she does not wear a Burqa' nor a Litham (face veil), and she lets down the garment over her face if she wishes\" (1).

Out of his ignorance, he thinks that the Athar without this addition implies obligation, while it only implies permissibility, and the addition confirms it. Regrettably, brother Al-Iskandarani imitated him in this omission (3 / 304), even though he attributed it to Al-Bayhaqi by volume and page.

As for the deed, it is what came in the hadith of her Umrah from At-Tan'im with her brother Abdur-Rahman. She said: (Authentic/Sahih) \"So he let me ride behind him on a camel of his. She said: So I began lifting my Khimar (head cover), exposing my neck, so he would strike my leg with the side of the mount (1).

And the narration of Muslim is more authentic in chain and weightier in text as I explained in \"The Introduction\". Therefore, the Sheikh did not attribute it to Muslim, and some of the blind followers followed him in that - like the one called Darwish in his \"Fasl\" (p. 43) - because it is a proof against them from the perspective that the Khimar does not cover the face linguistically as previously mentioned, and her being a Mu'tamirah (performing Umrah)",

    "text": "so it is not permissible for her to veil her face with it (Talaththum) as she said just now. So her covering of her face by letting down the cloth (Sadl) - as in some narrations - is an action from her which we acknowledge, but it does not indicate obligation, contrary to the claim of the opponents. I say: By this explanation, the interpretation of the mentioned Sheikh is invalidated due to its contradiction of the sayings of the Imams of Fiqh which explicitly state the permissibility of uncovering the face in prayer and outside it in the presence of men, and due to some of them reasoning the permissibility by the woman's need to buy and sell and take and give, and by the permissibility of eating together as well. The Sheikh interprets all these sayings to be regarding prayer and not in the presence of men, so what a false interpretation, nay, negation (Ta'til). Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we return. Furthermore, what confirms the Sheikh's ignorance of Fiqh and the sayings of the jurists - or at least his feigning ignorance, prejudice against me, and arrogance against the truth - is that among the references of his book (p. 109) is Ibn Muflih in \"Al-Adab Al-Shar'iyyah\". Ibn Muflih is one of the great Hanbali scholars of the eighth century and one of Ibn Taymiyyah's students. He used to say to him: \"You are not Ibn Muflih, rather you are Muflih (Successful).\" Ibn al-Qayyim said about him: There is no one under the dome of the sky more knowledgeable of the Madhhab of Imam Ahmed than Ibn Muflih (1). If you know this, then this Muflih said in his mentioned book \"Al-Adab Al-Shar'iyyah\" (1 / 316) the following text:",

Does the Sheikh and those who were misled by him - may Allah guide them - not know that the slander he directed at me at the end of his book - as previously mentioned - which is his saying: And whoever permits the unveiling of women and uses as evidence for that the likes of what Al-Albani used as evidence has opened the door of Tabarruj (display of beauty) wide open to the end of his nonsense, may Allah guide him, applies to them (the Imams) may Allah have mercy on them? The Sixth Research: Their negation (Ta'til) of the authentic hadiths that contradict them. Many hadiths have come regarding women uncovering their faces and hands - as will come in the book - the sum of which reaches the level of moral mass transmission (Tawatur Ma'nawi) among the people of knowledge. Therefore, the majority of scholars acted upon them. But the fanatical blind followers have also directed the pickaxes of sabotage and destruction at them by interpreting them, negating them, and invalidating their meanings and clear apparent indications, just as they did with the sayings of the Imams as you knew just now. There is no room here to debate them in all their interpretations, for their abundance requires composing a special treatise listing the hadiths and their sayings in interpreting them and then refuting them. So at least mentioning some models of them will suffice the fair reader regarding the rest. The First Hadith: It is the second in the book (p. 61 - 62), the hadith of the Khath'amiyyah woman, and in it is that she was beautiful and radiant, and in it: \"So Al-Fadl began looking at her and her beauty impressed him.\" [41]",

This is speech whose beginning contradicts its end and its end contradicts its beginning, for her \"extremities\" are the hands, feet, and head - as is known in the language - and accordingly what he denied in the beginning he affirmed in the end, but by way of twisting and turning - regrettably - for \"her extremities\" include the face linguistically. In \"Al-Qamus\": The Atraf (extremities) of the body: The hands, legs, and head. Was the Sheikh ignorant of this linguistic fact - as is his habit in his interpretation of (Jilbab), (Khimar), and (I'tijar) - or did he forget it for deception and misleading? If it was the first, was he ignorant of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: (Authentic/Sahih) \"When the servant prostrates, seven extremities (Atraf) prostrate with him: his face and his hands...\" The Hadith (1), or did he forget it too? Whether it was this or that, the sweeter of them is bitter. And soon (p. 44) will come what indicates that he did that for deception, for there it is: \"the extremities of her hands\"",

Second: His saying: \"Fa-Tafiq\" (So he began/continued), for its meaning is: He continued looking, like His saying, Exalted is He: (So he began [Tafiq] stroking [with his sword] the legs and necks) [Sad: 33] and His saying: (And they began [Tafiqa] sticking upon themselves from the leaves of Paradise) [Al-A'raf: 22].

Therefore, Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar - with his vast knowledge and knowledge of language and its etiquette - could not but say in response to Ibn Battal: She was a Muhrima (in Ihram), as will come there. And it is not hidden from the people of knowledge that this answer is only valid if it were not permissible for the Muhrima to cover her face by letting down [a cloth] over it, and this is something neither Al-Hafiz nor others among the scholars say; it is rejected. Some of them might feel the weakness of this response, so they deviate from the clear indication of the hadith on the permissibility of uncovering her face to saying that there is no proof in it for the permissibility of looking at her face, as came in the treatise of Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen and others. So we say: Yes, that is not permissible when there is fear of Fitnah, and for that reason, it is not permissible for her to look at the face of a foreign man during Fitnah. So is it obligatory for him to cover it from her? The Second Hadith: It is the third in the book (p. 64 - 65), the hadith of the woman who said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I came to gift myself to you...\" the Hadith. I say: It is ironically tragic that Sheikh At-Tuwaijri crammed this hadith into the group of hadiths he used to prove that it is permissible for a suitor to look at the face of his fiancee and her neck (sic) and the extremities of her hands (1).

    "text": "my using the hadith as evidence, he gave the impression that it is regarding a betrothed woman, while he knows that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, had not proposed to her - as I mentioned there from Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar - but rather she offered herself to him, peace and blessings be upon him, as is explicit in the hadith. This was in the mosque as in the narration of Al-Isma'ili and in full view of Sahl bin Sa'd, its narrator, and the people he was among, as in a narration of Al-Bukhari, Abu Ya'la, and At-Tabarani, and their narration is more complete as I listed there. So did it settle in the mind of the Sheikh and his imitators that proposing in full view of strangers is permissible? This is the matter they deny and exaggerate in denying, even by distorting words from their places, like the saying of some of them: Is it not in the hadith that she was uncovering her face? mentioned by the brother in \"Al-Awda\" (3 / 368) along with other sayings not worth mentioning due to the clarity of their falseness, among them the mentioned saying of At-Tuwaijri, and among them: That the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is infallible (Ma'sum). This is a word of truth intended for falsehood because the discussion is about the vision of the Sahaba (Companions) as is not hidden to anyone with eyes. In my opinion, the virtuous Sheikh Muhammad bin Salih bin Uthaymeen only did not address the answer to the hadith with any of these answers due to the appearance of their weakness, so he saw safety in silence and leaving argumentation, may Allah reward him with good.

The Third Hadith: It is the fifth in the book (p. 66), which is the hadith of Fatima bint Qais and his command, peace and blessings be upon him, to her to move to Ibn Umm Maktum the blind man, and he said to her: \"For if you put down your Khimar (head cover), he will not see you.\" I explained there the aspect of the hadith's indication that the face is not 'awrah. The Sheikh rejected that (p. 221 - 223) after long speech with no benefit, inserting into it what I do not say. Among that is his saying: And where is the text in the hadith regarding the obligation of covering the head alone and the prohibition of uncovering it before foreign men without the face and neck? I say: As for the text, it is in his permission for her to appear before the guests with her Khimar which does not cover the face, were it not for the fear of it falling off her so they would see her head. Therefore, he commanded her to move to Ibn Umm Maktum, may Allah be pleased with him, and he, peace and blessings be upon him, justified that by saying: \"For if you put down your Khimar, he will not see you.\" And the Khimar is the head cover according to the masses of scholars as previously verified in a way that cannot be rejected by anyone who understands and is fair. So this is the text regarding the head without the face. As for your saying: \"and the neck\", it is a cheap insertion. I do not know if the like of it can come from a virtuous, pious Sheikh who knows what comes out of his mouth? For he knows that mentioning the neck is not the subject of research and that there is no disagreement regarding it being 'awrah and that the Khimar covers it.

He is the most eloquent who spoke Arabic (Dad) and was given comprehensive words. For (Khimar) has a meaning in the language that Fatima, may Allah be pleased with her, understood, contrary to your unintelligible understanding, so there was no need for him to tell her what you proposed and obligated us with. Do you not see that the least understanding person can turn it against you and say to you: \"And if the matter were as you claim, that the Khimar covers the face also linguistically, he would have said: For if you put down your Khimar, he will not see your head and your face.\" So will you commit to this, O poor Sheikh, or will you answer similarly to my mentioned answer that the Khimar allegedly includes the face as well? Then it becomes clear to you that what you obligated us with is not binding and that you argue with falsehood to mislead people without knowledge. For in all your book and your response, you did not bring a text from the Book and Sunnah and the sayings of the early Imams - despite their different specializations - witnessing to your mentioned claim, and you will absolutely never find a way to that. Evidence of this is the clear statement of your countryman, the virtuous Sheikh Muhammad bin Uthaymeen: That the Khimar is what a woman covers her head with - as previously quoted from him. Therefore - I think - he also saw safety in not involving himself in the likes of your argumentation and obstinacy, so he did not address answering our deduction from this hadith. That is only due to the strength of its indication, and praise be to Allah by whose grace good deeds are completed. [47]",

Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in \"Al-Fatawa\" (1 / 246): And what is transmitted from the Salaf and the scholars requires knowledge of the establishment of its wording and knowledge of its indication, just as what is transmitted from Allah and His Messenger requires that. The Sheikh seems ignorant of this saying of Ibn Taymiyyah, for he did not verify what was transmitted from the Salaf nor its indication; rather, some of it is proof against him. Here are some examples: The First Hadith: From Ibn Abbas who said: (Weak) \"Allah commanded the believing women, if they go out of their houses for a need, to cover their faces... and show one eye.\" It will come in the book (p. 88). I clarified there that the hadith has two defects, so they closed their eyes to them and all followed in using it as evidence. As-Sindi declared (p. 19 - 20) the authenticity of its chain without verifying that according to the method of the scholars of Hadith - may Allah treat him as he deserves - and that was hidden from Al-Iskandarani so he approved it (2 / 265), and Allah's help is sought. Sheikh At-Tuwaijri repeated it repeatedly (p. 163, 226, and 265) and attributed me, because of my opposition to him, to heresy (Ilhad), so he said (p. 233): [48]\n\n\"And Al-Albani's speech in interpreting the Verse of Ahzab has not been preceded by anyone from the Sahaba and the Tabi'in, and he has contradicted what came from the Ink of the Ummah (Ibn Abbas) and others from the great Tabi'in in interpreting it. So it is, therefore, from heresy (Ilhad) regarding the verses of Allah Almighty and distortion of words...\" Thus he said - may Allah guide him - and I will not counter him except with His saying, Exalted is He, teaching us: (And indeed, we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error) [Saba: 24]. But I will prove to every fair person that the Sheikh's words will rebound on him, fulfilling his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, in the hadith agreed upon as authentic: (Authentic/Sahih) \"And whoever calls a man with disbelief or says: Enemy of Allah, and he is not so, except that it returns upon him\" and the saying of the proverb: \"She accused me of her disease and slipped away.\" That is because there is another narration from Ibn Abbas - in the source from which the Sheikh quoted the first narration, which is \"Al-Durr Al-Manthur\" - which the Sheikh and his imitators concealed because it contradicts their desires. Its text regarding the interpretation of the verse of Idna (lowering) is: \"And the lowering (Idna) of the Jilbab is that she puts it on her head (Tuqanni') and tightens it on her forehead.\" Narrated by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Mardawayh. This is the text of our saying, and Ibn Jarir mentioned it (22 / 33) under his saying: And others said: Rather, they were commanded to tighten their Jilbabs on their foreheads.

At-Tuwaijri did not realize this difference and preferred the narration of Ruh and used it as evidence. That is the extent of his knowledge in this art. \n[51].",

So it is truly strange and odd that Sheikh At-Tuwaijri - and those who imitated him from the gatherers and collectors - mentions this Athar after this weak hadith of Ibn Abbas and following that the Athar of 'Abida Al-Salmani - the defects of which will be explained. He mentioned this Athar after that citing it as evidence, while it is proof against him as you see. I do not know - by Allah - is this from the Sheikh's ignorance of his language or intentional ignoring from him? If it is the first, was it hidden from him that Imam Ibn Jarir mentioned it as a heading for the second opinion opposing the saying of those who held the weak hadith of Ibn Abbas? For he said after it (22 / 33): And others said: Rather, they were commanded to tighten their Jilbabs on their foreheads. He mentioned who said that? Then he cited under it the hadith of Ibn Abbas which is in the process of being preferred by these four matters, following it with this Athar of Qatada.

Indeed, some of them exceeded them and took a stance on what he has no knowledge of, so he authenticated it, namely the one called Salih bin Ibrahim Al-Baleeh in what he called \"O Girl of Islam\" (p. 201 and 252). This is something no scholar has said before and cannot be uttered by a beginner in this science. For here is the author of the book \"Al-Hijab\", brother Mustafa Al-Adawi, one of the emerging ones in this field, he had no choice but to admit the weakness of its chain (p. 28 and 46), although he concealed the second defect in it which is the weakness of Abdullah bin Salih as previously mentioned, but he declared it in his other book \"Ahkam An-Nisa\" (p. 19). What draws attention and catches the eye is the saying of the virtuous Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen after quoting the hadith assertively: And the interpretation of the Sahabi is proof, rather some scholars said: It is in the ruling of Marfu' (raised) to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. So I say: Yes, but establish the throne then engrave (establish the basis before the details). It was obligatory upon you, O virtuous Sheikh, before saying this, to answer the two defects of the hadith and prove its authenticity according to the principles of the science of Hadith as is supposed in such issues of dispute, especially while you are in the process of refuting your opponent who has weakened your hadith before. So if you accept its weakness, why did you use it as evidence? And if you see its authenticity, why did you not respond to him and establish the proof of its authenticity? Is this not incompatible [54]\n\nwith the good word you mentioned in your treatise, wherein it came (p. 32): That it is obligatory upon every researcher seeking justice and fairness... to stand between the evidences of the dispute in the position of a judge between two adversaries, so he judges by way of knowledge and does not prefer one of the two sides without a preponderant reason? I do not think you did what you obligated, because if you had done so, you would not have used it as evidence - Allah willing - due to the clarity of its weakness. Or if it is the opposite and you saw its authenticity - and this is very far from \"every researcher\" - then why did you conceal the proof of its authenticity? Is this the position of a judge between two adversaries? (O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do. Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do) [As-Saff: 2 & 3]. The Second Hadith: From the weak [narrations] which they used as evidence and which Sheikh At-Tuwaijri and his imitators were fond of: (Weak) \"Ibn Sirin's asking 'Abida Al-Salmani regarding the verse of (Idna)? So 'Abida veiled himself with a large sheet (Milhaf) and covered his entire head until he reached the eyebrows and covered his face and brought out his left eye.\" As-Suyuti extracted it in \"Al-Durr\" (5 / 221) and At-Tuwaijri quoted it (p. 163 - 164).

However, the mentioned context of Ibn Taymiyyah is not formal as is apparent, because it is not in the interpretation of the verse, but rather it is information about the reality of women in the first era. And in this meaning, it is authentic and established in many reports as will come in the book under the title: \"The Legitimacy of Covering the Face\" (p. 104).

    "text": "just as Sheikh At-Tuwaijri remained silent about it in more than one place in his book (p. 227 and 233), indicating thereby the strengthening of the first hadith. Beginners in this science know that such a ruined chain is not suitable for strengthening. But are they knowledgeable of it or are they wood-gathering transmitters? The sweeter of the two is bitter. The Fourth Hadith: From Al-Fadl bin Abbas who said: (Weak) I was riding behind the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and a Bedouin was with a daughter of his, beautiful. So he began offering her to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, hoping he would marry her. He said: So I began turning to look at her and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, began taking my head and twisting it. Abu Ya'la reported it in his \"Musnad\" (12 / 97) from the path of Yunus bin Abi Ishaq from Abu Ishaq from Sa'id bin Jubayr from Ibn Abbas from him. I say: And this is a weak chain, its narrators are trustworthy but its text is Munkar (denounced). It has five defects: First: The 'an'anah (narrating with 'from') of Abu Ishaq - who is Al-Sabi'i - for he is a Mudallis (obfuscator). Second: His mixing (Ikhtilat), so his hadith is not used as proof except what he narrated before mixing with his declaration of hearing (Tahdith), and that is not available here. As for the first, for what follows, and as for the other, for what preceded. Third: Lenience in his son Yunus, and perhaps that is specific to his narration from his father [58]\n\nfor he narrated from him after the mixing, as asserted by Ibn Numayr in what Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbali quoted from him in \"Sharh Ilal At-Tirmidhi\" (2 / 520) and see (2 / 672) of it. Fourth: His contradiction of his son Israel, who is trustworthy and has better memory than his father. For he narrated this hadith from his grandfather with it in chain and text except that he did not mention: \"and a Bedouin with a daughter of his... hoping he would marry her\". Ahmed reported it (1 / 213) and At-Tabarani in \"Al-Kabir\" (18 / 288). I say: And Israel is prioritized in case of difference over Yunus as preceded, and that is why Imam Ahmed said: The hadith of Israel is more beloved to me than him. I say: So this addition is Munkar due to the mentioned contradiction. This is on the assumption that it is not from the confusions of Abu Ishaq and that he did not narrate it. But if he narrated it, it would be Shadh (anomalous) due to what we mentioned of his condition. And for another defect, which is: Fifth: His contradiction of all the trustworthy narrators who narrated the hadith from Ibn Abbas without the addition, and they are four as far as I found, and all are trustworthy:",

It is not hidden from one with insight into this noble science that a single defect from these five defects is sufficient to weaken the hadith, so how about when they are combined? So the wonder of all wonders is from Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar, how he said in \"Al-Fath\" (4 / 67): Abu Ya'la narrated it with a strong chain? Sheikh Abdul-Qadir bin Habib Al-Sindi found this strengthening in his treatise \"Al-Hijab\" so he clung to it and dedicated a research from page (27 - 43 / 5th Edition) in which he tried to prove the authenticity of this chain via twisted strange ways and weak language, much of which is unintelligible due to his foreignness. And what was intelligible from it is what he mostly quoted from others, and in it is what is proof against him invalidating his mentioned authentication, along with a strange contradiction. For he quoted from Al-Hafiz that he said regarding Abu Ishaq Al-Sabi'i: \"He mixed up at the end\" then he commented saying: [60]",

That is, to present to the hardliners a new weapon to invalidate the indication of the authentic Hadith of the Khath'ami woman regarding the permissibility of uncovering the face. He admitted at the beginning of his research that it contains an approval of uncovering the face, contrary to Sheikh Al-Tuwaijri and his imitators. However, he rationalized her uncovering by saying it was only \"for the sake of looking regarding the right of a suitor,\" as he said (p. 37). He then reiterated this in two other places (p. 38 and 40). It is said to him: You have been afflicted with the mania of interpretation and the nullification of explicit evidences in the authentic Hadith agreed upon [by Bukhari and Muslim], by relying on this denounced addition, even though it does not state that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was a suitor. Rather, it mentions offering herself to him (peace be upon him) so perhaps he might marry her. Even if this were authentic, it is like the Hadith of the woman who offered herself to the Prophet (peace be upon him), which Al-Tuwaijri also interpreted as being for a suitor, yet there was no suitor, as previously explained in the rebuttal to him in \"Research Six: Nullifying the Authentic Hadiths Opposing Them\" (p. 41), so refer to it for it is important. Furthermore, even if we accepted what Al-Sindi claimed, that does not imply that the story of the Bedouin's daughter is the same as the story of the Khath'ami woman. Rather, this is certainly different from that. Al-Hafiz Ibn Al-Qattan leaned towards this in his book \"Al-Nazar fi Ahkam Al-Nazar\" (1-2/52) due to the difference in its context from that one, so it remained safe from that destructive interpretation. [62]\n\nThe Fifth Hadith: From Umm Salamah who said: I was with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and Maymunah was with him, when Ibn Umm Maktum approached—and that was after we were commanded with the Hijab. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Veil yourselves from him.\" We said: O Messenger of Allah, is he not blind, unable to see us or recognize us? The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Are you two blind? Do you not see him?\" Narrated by the authors of the Sunan except Ibn Majah, and others, via the path of Al-Zuhri: Nabhan, the freed slave of Umm Salamah, told me from her. It is documented in \"Al-Irwa\" (6 / 210 / 1806) and \"Al-Da'ifah\" (5958). Whoever wants the details should refer to them, or at least to the first of them because the other has not been printed as of this hour.

As for what is in his \"Tahdhib\": that Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman, the freed slave of the family of Talha, also narrated from him, this is not preserved (*Mahfuz*), as verified by Al-Bayhaqi and as I explained there in \"Al-Da'ifah\". In it is the rebuttal to Al-Hafiz in detail and to others who preceded him or imitated him among the imitators like Al-Tuwaijri and others who opposed scientific verification and the statements of other Imams—among them Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, as will come. Therefore, Al-Hafiz had no choice but to state explicitly in another place in \"Al-Fath\" (1 / 550): \"It is a Hadith about whose authenticity there is disagreement.\" Did Sheikh Al-Tuwaijri know of this text from Al-Hafiz or was he ignorant of it? If it is the former, then why did he suffice—whenever he mentioned this Hadith—with mentioning those who authenticated it among the lenient ones, and refuting those who opposed him by saying (p. 154): \"And no attention is paid to one who impugns it without relied-upon proof\"? Thus he spoke—may Allah guide him—referring thereby to the rebuttal against me, for I had weakened the Hadith due to ignorance [of the narrator] in \"Al-Irwa\" in the place referred to earlier.

Ibn Abd al-Barr said: Nabhan is unknown, not recognized except by Al-Zuhri's narration of this Hadith from him. The Hadith of Fatimah is authentic, so the argument is binding. Furthermore, it is possible that the Hadith of Nabhan is specific to the wives of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).

    "text": "The summary of the discussion on this Hadith is that the Sheikh and his imitators have contradicted—due to their narrow scientific horizon—Imam Ahmad and his followers among the great Hanbalis and others, both in terms of Hadith and Fiqh. regarding the first, because they authenticated the Hadith while it is weak according to Ahmad and others, flawed by ignorance [of the narrator], a flaw Ibn Al-Qattan did not notice in his \"Nazar\" (1/66), even though it is his habit to find defects in Hadith due to such things, and even due to the ignorance of the [narrator's] condition (Jahalah Haliyyah), as he did with the Hadith of Umm Subayyah: \"My hand and the hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) alternated in [taking water for] ablution from one vessel.\" (Q 20 / 2), which is an authentic Hadith documented in \"Sahih Abi Dawood\" (71). As for the other [contradiction], it is because they applied it to women in general, while it is specific to his wives (peace be upon him). This is what Al-Hafiz deemed good in \"Al-Talkhis\" (3 / 148), saying: And Al-Mundhiri combined them [the hadiths] in this way in his margins, and our Sheikh deemed it good. As for non-Hanbalis, Al-Qurtubi said in his \"Tafsir\" (12 / 228): \"This Hadith is not authentic according to the scholars of transmission because its narrator Nabhan is one whose Hadith is not used as proof.\" So what is the recourse with this Sheikh who takes from statements whatever he desires, even if their error and contradiction to the scholars' rules become clear?

    "text": "Here, I must draw attention to some deceptions, misleading statements, and obfuscations by Sheikh Abdul Qadir Al-Sindi in his \"Hijab\", his exploitation of the slips of some scholars, and his turning away from applying their scientific rules which they established for those after them to adhere to and surrender their minds to, not to deviate from them to imitate them in what they contradicted their own rules in, as he did in the biography of Al-Sabi'i and others in the Hadith of the Khath'ami woman (p. 26). So I say: First: He repeated twice on one page (49) his claim that the chain of this Hadith is authentic, then he emphasized that on the page following it, reminding one of the well-known proverb: \"A goat even if it flies,\" because it is a mere claim which he did not substantiate with the biography of its narrator Nabhan at the very least, and what all the Imams of criticism (*Jarh*) said about him, instead of limiting himself to quoting authentication without the declaration of ignorance [of his status]. What follows confirms this. Second: He concealed Al-Hafiz's statement in \"At-Taqrib\": \"Maqbul\" (Acceptable), because he knows that he means by it that he is lenient in Hadith, and that it contradicts Al-Hafiz's statement in \"Al-Fath\" regarding it, which has no basis in science as previously mentioned. Third: He said following his referenced statement in \"Al-Fath\": And the scholar Al-Mubarakfuri quoted it in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi \"and supported it.\" This is a lie against Al-Mubarakfuri because mere quotation does not imply support—as is not hidden from the people of knowledge—especially since he quoted Al-Hafiz's statement in [69]",

If this [latter one] was support, then that [former one] is support too. Al-Mubarakfuri is merely a narrator and was not in the position of researching and verifying to prefer one saying over another, unlike Al-Sindi. Therefore, he concealed the statement of \"At-Taqrib\" because it necessitates the weakness of the Hadith, due to Al-Sindi's knowledge that it means Nabhan is lenient in Hadith because he has no corroborator. Therefore, he proceeds upon the ominous Jewish principle: \"The end justifies the means.\" Were it not for that, he would have quoted it too and tried to reconcile between them. But since he knew—I think—that criticism (*Jarh*) takes precedence over modification (*Ta'dil*)—especially if the modification needs modification itself—he saw that retreating and fleeing is half of courage—as is said in some lands—so that concealment occurred from him. And Allah is the one whose help is sought. Fourth: Al-Sindi copied Nabhan's biography from the \"Tahdhibs\" of Al-Mizzi and Al-Asqalani, and in them: that Ibn Hibban mentioned him in \"Al-Thiqat\", misleading the readers that they authenticated him as well. It is not so, as is known to scholars familiar with their style, which is merely to quote what was said about the subject regarding criticism and modification. That is why Al-Hafiz authored his aforementioned book \"Taqrib Al-Tahdhib\", for he exercises ijtihad in it, not just copying, presenting his opinion on the subject with the fewest possible words. Researching to verify this is something for which there is no room here. It suffices the intelligent, fair reader as an example of what I mentioned that Al-Hafiz who [70]",

The Third: His attributing to Al-Mizzi that he said: \"He narrated it from other paths.\" This is a pure lie or malicious deception, for Al-Mizzi only said: \"From other paths from Al-Zuhri.\" I would have liked to say: Perhaps the phrase \"from Al-Zuhri\" dropped from his pen by mistake, were it not that he repeated that again on the same page, and that there is no benefit in quoting the sentence in full; rather, it is evidence against him because it explicitly indicates Nabhan's isolation with the Hadith. So let the rational person reflect on what desire or ignorance does to its owner and into what deep valley it throws him. We ask Allah for safety. The Fourth: His ignoring his contradiction of the Hadith of Muslim from Fatimah bint Qays as explained by the scholars. Clearer than it is the narration of Al-Tabarani in \"Al-Kabir\" (24 / 377) with an authentic chain from her, she said: \"And he (peace be upon him) commanded me to stay at the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man who cannot see me when I take off my Khimar (headcover).\" These are five Hadiths from the weak Hadiths circulated by most authors on the prohibition of [showing] women's faces and hands. They differ in maximizing or minimizing [72]\n\nthem according to one's expansion on the subject and what is connected to it. The most expansive of them in this is Sheikh Al-Tuwaijri—may Allah guide him—for he established a bad precedent. He gathered in his book all the flimsy Hadiths he found which he imagines strengthen his argument, not realizing that in reality, they dull his \"sword\" (*sarim*) and make it blunt and unable to perform what he intended. Their number reached nearly fifty raised (*marfu'*) Hadiths—or more—including the weak, the denounced (*munkar*), and the fabricated (*mawdu'*). It is useful to present to the reader samples of them so they may be aware of them firstly, and so they may know the reality of the Sheikh's knowledge and those who followed his path secondly, without discussing their chains, sufficing with referring to my book in which I documented them and spoke about them in detail.\n\n1 - \"The statement of Fatimah, may Allah be pleased with her, when she was asked: What is best for women?

By Allah, I am confused by this Sheikh who combines contradictions in his mind. He is strict with women at times, forbidding them what Allah permitted of showing the face and hands, and is lenient with them at times, permitting them what Allah forbade of showing to her Muslim sister what is above her navel. This is a matter which some Hanafis, accused of relying on opinion (*Ra'y*), did not fall into, for they did not hold this view of the Sheikh; they did not permit [showing] the back and belly because they are not places of adornment, as in \"Al-Bahr Al-Ra'iq\" (8 / 220). What increased my confusion is that by this, he also contradicted the narration of Ibn Mas'ud which the commentators rely upon and which the Sheikh approved (p. 156), because it is in another narration from him that aligns with his aforementioned strictness. Is it ignorance or feigned ignorance and following of desire?\n\nI do not know, by Allah. Brother Al-Adawi imitated him in both matters in his \"Hijab\" and \"Ahkam\" (16-17), despite his knowledge—and that of his role model—of the many evils that result from women uncovering themselves before Muslim women, and even before Dhimi women, and even before Mahram men according to the \"Madhhab\" of Al-Tuwaijri.\n\n4 - \"Women are foolish (*Sufaha'*) except the one who obeyed her guardian. (p. 68)\". \"Al-Da'ifah\" (6051)\n\n6 - \"There is no morning but two angels call out: Woe to men from women and woe to women from men. (p. 70)\" Al-Da'ifah (2018)\n\n7 - \"Fear the world and fear women, for Iblis is a watcher and lurker, and he has nothing among his traps more reliable for his hunting of the pious than women. (p. 71)\" And this is one of his fabricated ones. \"Al-Da'ifah\" (2065)",

The narration of Shu'bah, which he used for strength, does not contain the detailed narration that mentions the inner adornment. This is an example of his haste in authorship.

Their methods in doing so varied; some of them were content with mentioning one path and weakening it, and some exceeded that as you will see. But they all agreed on quoting what was said about the narrator regarding criticism (*Jarh*) without the authentication (*Ta'dil*) (1). Indeed, some of them deceived and misled that there is no authenticator, and even that he is in the utmost degree of weakness such that he is not used for support (*Istish-had*), and this is a sheer lie.

    "text": "through paths and Salafi traditions (*Athar*), a matter which confirmed that they are intruders in this science. Even if there are among them those who have some knowledge of it, they have transgressed against the Sunnah and deviated from the truth by following forefathers and schools of thought (*Madhahib*). The explanation of that is from several aspects: First: That even though I had documented the Hadith in this book of mine from the Hadith of Aisha, Asma bint Umays, and Qatada, explaining the defect of the chains of the first two and the disconnection (*Irsal*) of the third, the majority of them concealed this fact and misled their readers that I only used the Hadith of Aisha alone as proof and that I did not explain the weakness of its chain. It is not so, as is written in the book and will be explained now. Among that majority: Sheikh Al-Tuwaijri, Ibn Uthaymeen, Al-Shanqiti in \"Al-Adwa\" (6 / 597), and others. It was incumbent upon them—had they been fair—to clarify the point of disagreement between me and them and not to mislead them contrary to reality, bearing the burden of those who state explicitly like the author of \"Hijabuki Ukhti Al-Muslimah\" (Your Hijab, My Muslim Sister), for she said (p. 33): \"As for the group that permitted uncovering women's faces, it did not (sic) use as evidence except the Hadith of Abu Dawood...\" She is in that imitating Al-Tuwaijri in this denial (p. 236). It seems from her definition of the Mursal Hadith that she understands absolutely nothing of the science of terminology. Second: That it is not permissible for them to limit themselves to quoting the sayings of those who criticize the narrator without the sayings of those who oppose them, especially when they are in the process of refuting their opponents,\n\nfor this contradicts the scientific integrity entrusted to them, as is apparent. Sheikh Abdul Qadir Al-Sindi—may Allah guide him—took the lead in this concealment. He added to it that he misled the readers that the concealment was the action of Al-Dhahabi, while he is innocent of it. Also, he did not mention from the three Hadiths—following Al-Shanqiti, Al-Tuwaijri, and Ibn Uthaymeen—except the Hadith of Aisha. He said after mentioning its known disconnection (p. 13 - 14): \"I say: In its chain is another damaging defect, which is that Sa'id bin Bashir is *Munkar al-Hadith* (narrates denounced hadith). Imam Al-Dhahabi said...\" Then he blackened six lines all of criticism phrases and commented on it attributing to: Mizan Al-I'tidal by Imam Al-Dhahabi 2 / 128. I say: If the readers return to this source from which Al-Sindi quoted those phrases, they will find immense wonder and strange audacity in deception and misleading. For he left out of \"Al-Mizan\" what disturbs the balance of criticism and moderation in it. Here is some of what he left out, may Allah guide him:\n\n1 - Abu Hatim said: \"His place is truthfulness (*Sidq*).\"\n\n2 - Shu'bah said: \"Truthful of tongue.\"\n\n3 - Ibn Al-Jawzi said: \"Shu'bah and Duhaym authenticated him.\"\n\n4 - Abu Hatim said: \"He is to be moved from (The Book of Weak Narrators).\"",

This Hisham is Ibn Abi Abd Allah Al-Dastuwa'i, and he is trustworthy and firm (*Thiqah Thabt*) from the narrators of the two Sheikhs [Bukhari and Muslim]. I say: This is strong corroboration from Hisham for Sa'id, indicating that Sa'id memorized the text of the Hadith but erred in attributing its chain to Aisha, due to Hisham contradicting him, for he [Hisham] did not go beyond Qatada. Thus, his chain is authentic Mursal, because Qatada is a prominent Tabi'i. Al-Hafiz said in \"At-Taqrib\": Trustworthy, firm. [85]",

It is from the ignorance of some of those clinging to this science that after severely weakening the narration of Sa'id bin Bashir from Qatada from Khalid bin Durayk from Aisha, he returned to rely on it to strike down this authentic Mursal narration of Qatada. He said: \"Since Qatada narrated the Hadith from Khalid bin Durayk from Aisha, it is not impossible that he omitted Khalid and Aisha and mentioned the Hadith as Mursal, since Qatada is a Mudallis.\" Thus said Al-Adawi in his \"Hijab\" (p. 72) and Al-Anbari followed him in his booklet (p. 25). Reflect on how he affirmed the narration of Qatada from Khalid... after severely weakening it, and used it to interpret the authentic narration of Hisham from Qatada? Is this not playing on two ropes or weighing with two scales? As for us, we preferred this authentic Mursal narration of Qatada due to the strength of its chain, following the science of Hadith, although we believe that this does not weaken our argument at all, because both the Mursal and connected narrations support each other in text. And witnessing to them is the third Hadith from Asma bint Umays mentioned in the book (p. 58). Al-Adawi did with it what Al-Sindi did with the Hadith of Aisha; he announced (p. 70) that its weakness is severe, then outlined three defects for it, none of which supports his aforementioned claim: [86]",

The Second: Iyad bin Abdullah. He mentioned the scholars' disagreement regarding him and that most of them weakened him. This, as you see, does not mean he is severely weak; rather, he is like Ibn Lahi'ah, as indicated by Al-Hafiz's statement in \"At-Taqrib\": \"There is leniency in him.\" That is why Al-Adawi avoided him. The Third: The narrator's saying: \"I think it is from Asma...\" He said: \"And this weakens the chain.\" I say: No, because what is meant is: Preponderant belief (*Zann Rajih*), which is obligatory to act upon—as established in the science of Usul. Furthermore, the mentioned statement only appeared in Al-Bayhaqi's narration, contrary to Al-Tabarani's narration in \"Al-Mu'jam Al-Awsat\" though the path is one, and contrary to his narration in \"Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir\" from another path from Ibn Lahi'ah. Then suppose this statement is established in the narration, from where do you get that it implies the severe weakness you claimed? For the apparent meaning is that he thinks—meaning: the narrator—that the Hadith is from Asma or another Companion. The worst possibility is that he doesn't know if it is connected from a Companion or Mursal. Does that make the chain very weak? Or is it desires that blind and deafen? Perhaps what supports what I mentioned of preponderant belief is that Ubayd bin Rifa'ah, the narrator from Asma, is known for his narration from her [87]",

He has a Hadith in them which I documented in \"Silsilat Al-Ahadith Al-Sahihah\" under number (1252) and others. Then after Al-Adawi came one who imitated him in claiming severe weakness in the first two defects but not the third, as if it appeared to him that it has no value and is not an absolute defect. However, he claimed another defect in which he is more invalid than his role model. He claimed that Ubayd bin Rifa'ah is unknown (*Majhul*) and no one authenticated him except Ibn Hibban and Al-Ajli. That is Al-Anbari, for he said in his booklet (p. 16): \"It is not hidden that their authentication is flimsy (*rakhw*) and cannot be relied upon.\" Thus he spoke, may Allah reform him. The flimsiness he claimed is not absolute, but rather in the authentication of one who is not known except by the narration of one or two—as I verified in other than this place—and Ubayd is not like that. A group of trustworthy narrators narrated from him as you see in \"Al-Tahdhib\". Al-Dhahabi authenticated him in \"Al-Talkhis\", and At-Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim authenticated for him. Furthermore, he is a Tabi'i born during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and it was even said he has companionship. Wonder at these emerging ones deluded by themselves, and their audacity and haste in issuing judgments on narrators and others with what they were not preceded in by the critical Huffaz. A matter which reminds us of the well-known proverb: \"He became a raisin before becoming a sour grape.\" Furthermore, even if we conceded the anonymity (*Jahalah*) of Ubayd, that does not prevent citation of him as will come in Ibn Taymiyyah's words (p. 97 - 98).

So our friend said following it (p. 39): \"As if he considers it Hasan by it, as is known from his methodology, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him. For a Muhaddith does not cite a witness except for what can be mended in his view, otherwise what benefit does the witness provide if it is useless?\" The alluded one criticized him with the summary (p. 16): \"That the ancient Muhaddithin, and among them the contemporaries, continue to mention weak or fabricated Hadith and cite its witnesses which only increase it in weakness upon weakness, and no one said: that by doing so they improve the Hadith.\" Then he mentioned six examples of that: one from \"Al-La'ali\" by Al-Suyuti and the others from my books \"Al-Da'ifah\" and \"Al-Irwa\". Then he answered a question he posed himself, the summary of which is: \"That the citation of weak paths by Muhaddithin is only to draw attention to their weakness (1).\" I say: This is a false criticism indicating extreme ignorance of this noble science and its principles. For strengthening a Hadith by numerous paths—provided their weakness is not severe—is a known matter and a trodden path among the scholars of Hadith, needing no proof (1).",

My books are overflowing with this type of Hadith and reminders of it, especially the \"Sahihah\" ones. Likewise the quoting from biographical books and their differentiation between the weak narrator who is cited for support and others who are not cited due to the severity of their weakness. The examples he mentioned differ completely from the Hadith of Asma which Al-Hafiz cited as witness and my friend used for strength, from two aspects: One: That they—meaning: the examples—are severely weak, so they are not fit for witnessing. The other: That those who cited them followed them with an explanation of their severe weakness. So where is this compared to the action of Al-Hafiz, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him, which the alluded one rejected? For Al-Hafiz did not explain its weakness, and had he done so, it would not be correct to liken it to those examples because it is not severely weak. As for his aforementioned answer, it confirms his ignorance of this science because he did not explain the reason for alerting to the weakness and its fruit. The answer is known partly at least from the foregoing, which is that if the weakness is slight and its paths are numerous, the Hadith is strengthened and it becomes obligatory to act upon it, like this Hadith of ours. Otherwise, it would be *Gharib* (strange/unsupported), not permissible to act upon, nor even to narrate without explaining its weakness. This is what the majority of authors have neglected, for they are lenient in narrating weak Hadiths without explaining their weakness, as Al-Tuwaijri did in the ten preceding examples, and he and others ignored the strengthening of this Hadith by its paths.

The aforementioned person imitated them in that - as preceded - without noticing what they were aiming at with the mentioned claim. Then I corrected myself and said: Rather, he noticed that and followed them in it intentionally. For when he discussed the chain of the Mursal (hurried) hadith of Qatada, he said (p. 23): The truth is that the chain to Qatada is authentic and very clean. And it is correct that the Mursal, if supported by a weak Musnad (connected) chain, becomes authentic (Sahih) and proof. This is a truth indisputable. However, those who rely on this statement missed the fact that the Mursal narrations of Qatada are weak and no proof is established by them ever. Then he blackened more than a page quoting some Imams stating that Qatada's Mursal is not used as proof and that it is like the wind. So I say - and Allah's help is sought against the emerging generation of this time -: The non-validity of Qatada's Mursal is not a point of contention. Rather: Does it get strengthened by a weak Musnad or not? This is the subject. We see, following Al-Bayhaqi and others, that it does get strengthened, and this is the explicit statement of the aforementioned person: \"And it is correct...\" etc. But due to his novelty, he did not remain firm on it, so he contradicted it by saying: \"However, those missed...\" Therefore, he responded with lack of manners and extreme ignorance to Al-Bayhaqi's strengthening of the Mursal of Khalid bin Duraik, which I had quoted from him in \"The Book\" (p. 59).

Rather, you are the one who missed your \"correctness\" which you contradicted with the end of your speech. Then you transgressed against Imam Al-Bayhaqi and then Adh-Dhahabi, who strengthened the Mursal of Khalid bin Duraik with the saying of the Companions - meaning: Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar, Abu Huraira, and others as preceded (p. 34 and 49 - 51) and (p. 59) of \"Al-Jilbab\". You did not pay any heed to that and acted arrogantly and said without the slightest shame: \"And it is opposed by the saying of those who passed from the Companions as well, and the saying of Ibn Mas'ud has preceded, may Allah be pleased with him.\" I say: This opposition indicates to us that you are an intruder in this science and that you speak nonsense about what you do not know. Who are the Companions with whose saying you oppose the saying of the Companions whom Al-Bayhaqi referred to? They do not exist except in your imagination, so the opposition is invalid. As for the saying of Ibn Mas'ud, the answer to it has preceded in \"The Book\" (p. 52 - 56). Moreover, he is an individual opposed by a group. If opposition by him is valid, there must be a preponderant factor (Murajjih), which is the hadith acted upon by his opponents. By it, their saying is preferred over the saying of Ibn Mas'ud, and the opposition by it falls, and the saying of Al-Bayhaqi and those who followed him remains sound, and they are the majority of the Companions and Imams as previously explained in a way you will not find elsewhere.

So Al-Hasan in this is like Qatada. Yet, Imam Shafi'i strengthened Al-Hasan's Mursal: \"No marriage except with a guardian and two just witnesses\" with some of what we strengthened the hadith of Qatada with. He said in his book \"Ahkam Al-Qur'an\" following this Mursal: This, although it is disconnected (meaning: Mursal), most of the people of knowledge hold it, and say: The difference between marriage and illicit intercourse is the witnesses. And it is established from Ibn Abbas and others from the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him (1). Al-Bayhaqi said: Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, confirmed Al-Hasan's Mursal with two things: One: That most of the people of knowledge hold it. Second: That it is established from Ibn Abbas from his saying (2).

Like a person reporting an incident that occurred and mentioning details of sayings and actions in it, and another person comes, known not to have colluded with the first, and mentions what the first mentioned of details of sayings and actions. It is known definitively that that incident is true in general. For if each of them had lied about it intentionally or by error, it would not happen habitually that each of them brings those details which habit prevents two agreeing upon without collusion from one to his companion.

Therefore, if the hadith in which that occurs is narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, from two aspects with the knowledge that one of them did not take it from the other, it is asserted that it is true, especially if it is known that its transmitters are not those who intentionally lie, but rather forgetfulness and error are feared from one of them.

Among them is Al-Bayhaqi, for he cited it in \"Shu'ab Al-Iman\" (1 / 247) with a weak chain from the hadith of Abu Rafi', then said: And Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak used to do it and the righteous people circulated it among themselves, and in that is a strengthening for the Marfu' hadith. And with Allah is success. Al-Hakim preceded him to this, so he said in \"Al-Mustadrak\" (1 / 319): And among what indicates the authenticity of this hadith is the practice of the Imams from the followers of the Tabi'in to our time and their perseverance on it and teaching it to people, and among them is Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak...\" Then he cited his chain for that to Ibn Al-Mubarak and said following it: Its narrators from Ibn Al-Mubarak are trustworthy, and Abdullah is not accused of teaching what is not authentic according to him [100]",

It is as if they do not know - what is known among scholars as the Hasan Hadith or the Sahih due to other than it (Sahih li-Ghayrihi). And their likeness in that - as some said - is only like a judge to whom a case was presented requiring the testimony of a man and two women. So a woman testified, and he rejected her because her testimony is half the testimony of a man. Then another came and testified similar to the testimony of the first, so he rejected her too with the same reasoning. This is the likeness of these people. And Allah's help is sought. This is the bane of most writers today who found this science easy so they rushed to authenticate and weaken without knowing its principles and rules. I saw one of them come to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"There is no Zakat on wealth until a year passes over it.\" So he weakened it from its four paths while he knows that Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar and others strengthened it. He also knows that the practice of the Rightly Guided Caliphs was upon it. Yet he paid no heed to all of that, even though he missed an authentic path which he did not mention. I had pointed to it in the referencing of the hadith in \"Al-Irwa\" (3 / 254 / 767) and it is in \"Sahih Abi Dawud\" (1403). So it was upon him to search for it, or else submit to the people of knowledge and specialization their research and knowledge [101]",

(O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do. Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do) [As-Saff: 2 & 3]. The Ninth Research: Interpretation of the Verse of Adornment (Zinah): (...except what appears thereof). After we have proven the authenticity of this hadith according to the methodology of the people of Hadith and the rules of its scholars firstly, and by the declaration of some of them regarding its strength secondly, and without any significant opponent to them thirdly, I want to clarify to our noble readers that it is then suitable to be an explanation for the saying of the Exalted: (and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof). So his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, in it: \"It is not right for anything to be seen of her\" is an explanation of His saying: (and not expose their adornment) meaning: the places of adornment from their bodies and not their clothes as preceded. And his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, in it: \"except her face and her hands\" is an explanation of His saying: (except what appears) meaning: her face and her hands. So the prohibited in the verse is the prohibited in the hadith, and the excepted in it is the excepted in the hadith. And Allah the Great spoke the truth when He said: (And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them) [An-Nahl: 44]. From here appears the precision of understanding of the Translator of the Quran (Ibn Abbas) and those with him from the noble Companions when they interpreted the exception in it as the face and hands [102]\n\nAnd this was hidden from us when we authored the book, then we realized that in the new edition (p. 51 - 56) and here. So praise be to Allah by whose grace good deeds are completed. On this occasion, I must list the names of the Companions referred to, mentioning some of those who extracted it and those who authenticated some of it, so that the readers may know the ignorance of those who opposed them or denied anything of it or misled those who adhered to it.\n\n1 - Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her.

She said after mentioning it (p. 35 - 36): But Ibn Abbas in his Tafsir which is relied upon by them () says otherwise, and I will quote it literally. Then she quoted it from \"Al-Miqbas\" (p. 294) in Surat An-Nur that he said in the interpretation of: \"except what appears thereof): from her clothes. I say: We used to complain about the deception of some men - as preceded - and suddenly we are surprised by the deception of what is called today the \"fair sex\". That is because her saying: \"relied upon by them\" has no reality except in her knowledge which led her to participate with men in writing on this issue. Perhaps because of her extensive knowledge - as she saw that this \"Tafsir Ibn Abbas\" has been printed several times - she imagined that the book is relied upon by scholars. So then the book \"Al-Tabaqat Al-Kubra\" by Al-Sha'rani would also be relied upon despite the blasphemies and idolatries in it, like the saying of one of his Awliya (saints): \"I left my saying to a thing: Be, and it is. For twenty years out of politeness with Allah\", because it was printed - perhaps - more than ten times. It seems to me - and Allah knows best - that this poor woman did not read in the beginning of this \"Relied Upon Tafsir\" that it is from Muhammad bin Marwan from Al-Kalbi from Abu Salih from Ibn Abbas, or that she read and did not understand, or that she understood but with the understanding of the commoners: that every hadith with a chain is proven. We say this because if she had any knowledge authorizing her to write, authenticate, and weaken, she would have known that this Muhammad bin Marwan - who is As-Suddi As-Saghir - is a liar, and likewise his Sheikh Al-Kalbi, whose name is Muhammad bin As-Sa'ib. I have mentioned some fabricated hadiths from them in \"As-Silsilah Al-Da'ifah\" (numbers 111, 203, 608, 730, 859, 1111, 1318, and 1567). Due to the bad condition of this Al-Kalbi, when Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned that \"Tafsir Imam At-Tabari\" is the most authentic of Tafsirs, he mentioned in \"Al-Fatawa\" (13 / 385) that one of the reasons for that is that he does not narrate from the accused like Muqatil bin Bashir and Al-Kalbi. Similar is in \"Kashf Al-Zunun\" (1 / 429) and see \"Al-Taratib Al-Idariyyah\" (2 / 255) \n[103].\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone",

One of those pseudo-scholars who rush to write about what they do not master added to that, blackening seven pages of his booklet explaining the jealousy (Ghayrah) of Asma's husband - who is Az-Zubair Ibn Al-Awwam - and her shyness from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and her observance of her husband's right, which has no relation to the subject at all except for deception and fallacy coupled with exaggeration in raising the non-infallible to the rank of infallibility. After this we say: The answer is from two aspects: First: That the mentioned unlikelihood has no relation to the text (Matn) of the hadith which is from his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, and is established from him by the sum of its paths and witnesses and the practice of the Companions and those after them upon it as preceded. So it is not harmed nor is its authenticity weakened by the fact that some of its paths contain what is unlikely or denounced, and its chain is weak as I had explained in my book \"Al-Hijab\" previously and here as well. So this part of it is left, and what is in it that agreed with the other paths and witnesses is used as evidence. Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, pointed to this [105]",

Meaning: not in the details upon which the paths did not agree. So the unlikely is of this sort as is apparent to everyone with insight. From this premise, I said in \"Al-Irwa\" (6 / 203): So the hadith, by the sum of the two paths, is Hasan regarding what was in it of his speech, peace and blessings be upon him. As for the reason (Sabab), it is weak due to the difference in its wording in the two paths as I mentioned.\" And the other aspect: Considering that unlikely is blatant obstinacy, the likes of which we have long seen from them. This is because there is nothing in the Sharia - nor in reason - that prevents such from occurring from Asma or others due to the absence of infallibility (Ismah) as I mentioned just now. How so when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, permitted that something occurs from the Truthful, Purified Aisha, Asma's sister, which makes what these people considered unlikely from Asma seem insignificant, which is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, to Aisha in the story of Al-Ifk (The Slander): (Authentic/Sahih) \"If you have committed a sin, seek Allah's forgiveness and repent to Him...\" the Hadith? Narrated by the Two Sheikhs and others and it is extracted in \"As-Sahihah\" (1208). Add to what preceded that there is nothing in the hadith of Asma that she wore thin clothes out of Tabarruj (display) and opposition to the Sharia. So if that was authentic from her - and it was not as you knew - it would be obligatory to interpret it as being from her out of heedlessness or lack of knowledge. For it occurred [106]",

Narrated by Malik in \"Al-Muwatta\" (3 / 103). So it is proven from this explanation that what they considered unlikely is not unlikely religiously nor rationally, although it is not established, and even if it were established, it would not scratch the text of the hadith. And Allah is the Guardian of success. And if you wonder, then wonder at these people, how they cling to what is not authentic in narration (Riwayah) and knowledge (Dirayah) if it is against them? But if it is for them, they accept it and give the illusion of its firmness, while it is more worthy of being unlikely. Sheikh At-Tuwaijri mentioned in his book (p. 181) from the narration of Aisha that she veiled her face (Tanaqqabat) to look at Safiyyah when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, arrived with her in Medina. So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, asked Aisha: (Weak) \"How did you see?\" She said: A Jewess among Jewesses. So this saying regarding Safiyyah and the women of the Ansar with her is not unlikely to them. Why?

The Third Doubt: They claimed that if the hadith were authentic, Asma bint Abu Bakr, to whom the hadith was directed, would not have opposed it, for she used to cover her face from men while she was in Ihram. We say: First: The paths did not agree on mentioning Asma as they agreed on its text. If that is established that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, directed the hadith to her, then the answer is: Second: We have decided repeatedly that a woman covering her face is better, contrary to what was fabricated [109]",

So your claim of absoluteness is rejected against you, especially since you built upon it the rejection of this authentic hadith or the negation of its indication with the pickaxe of interpretation (Ta'wil) with which you demolished definitive evidences, especially what was from Prophetic Hadith, as you and your imitator did with the hadith of the Khath'amiyyah woman and others - as preceded in \"The Sixth Research\" (p. 41 - 44) - and with the hadith of Fatima bint Qais - as preceded there (p. 46 - 47) - and he was imitated by one who runs after him without any research or investigation - like Ibn Khalaf and others - then you quoted it [112]",

For no matter what I think of you and your likes among the opponents, I do not think you would order your women to cover their faces if they stood for prayer in the house acting upon his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Allah does not accept the prayer of a menstruating woman except with a Khimar\" based on your claim that the Khimar is a face cover as well. The point is that lowering [the gaze] is not on its absolute sense as you claimed. Therefore, Ibn Kathir said in the completion of his previous speech: (Authentic/Sahih) \"So if it happens that the gaze falls on a forbidden thing unintentionally, he should turn his gaze away from it quickly as Muslim narrated from Jarir who said: I asked the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, about the sudden glance? So he ordered me to divert my gaze\" (1). I say: So the Verse, then, like the Hadith, only commands lowering the gaze from what is forbidden. So justice is to say: If the woman's face is among what is forbidden for her to uncover in front of strangers, looking is forbidden for them, and if it is permissible, it is permissible. Were the people fair? The answer regrettably: No. And the proof: That they do not allow a woman to look at a man's face and what is below it",

Just as they used as evidence the hadith: \"Are you two blind?\" which is weak as previously explained and answered assuming its authenticity (p. 63 - 72). Then they went to great lengths to reject the evidences of those who permit looking without suspicion, as they did with the hadith of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, looking at the Abyssinians while they were playing with their spears in the mosque. It is extracted in \"Adab Al-Zifaf\" (272 - 274 / Al-Maktaba Al-Islamiyya) from the narration of the Two Sheikhs and others. In it: That the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to her: (Authentic/Sahih) \"Do you like to look at them?\". And her saying: So he lowered his shoulders for me so I could look at them. And her saying: And I had no love for looking at them but I loved that women would know my position to him and my place with him. Despite these explicit texts regarding her looking at them, they negated their indication - as is their habit - by saying sometimes: There is nothing in the hadith that she looked at their faces and bodies, but rather she looked at their playing. I say: It suffices the noble reader to imagine this answer for its falsity to appear to him, since it is impossible to separate looking at the attribute, which is playing, and the attributed, which is the player. So Aisha was looking, in their claim, at the playing without the player. Thus let texts be negated. If they had said: She did not look at an 'awrah or did not look at them with a suspicious look or with fear of Fitnah, they would have been correct, for this is what is forbidden between the sexes [114]",

Their sayings have preceded in some previous researches and I will collect them for you soon, Allah willing. Then I saw a very strong speech by Al-Hafiz Ibn Al-Qattan - which I did not see from others of the people of knowledge - agreeing with what I mentioned of fairness on one hand, and meeting in the end with their sayings referred to on the other hand. So I saw not to miss its benefit for the readers. He said, may Allah have mercy on him, in his book (Folio 54 / 2): We have presented in places that permission to show is proof of permission to look. So if we say: It is permissible for a woman to show her face and hands to everyone without the aspect of Tabarruj (display) and without necessity because that is of what appeared of her adornment and of what is difficult to maintain covering in the state of work, then it is permissible for people to look at that from her. Because if looking were forbidden while showing is permissible for her, that would be assisting in sin, exposing to disobedience, and causing Fitnah, tantamount to offering dead meat to an eater who is not compelled. So whoever among the jurists said it is permissible to show, he does not need to establish evidence for the permissibility of looking. Likewise, it should be that whoever did not permit the woman to show and reveal does not need to establish evidence for the prohibition of looking. We have presented that it is permissible for a woman to show her face and hands, so then looking at that is permissible but on the condition that Fitnah is not feared and pleasure is not intended. As for if pleasure is intended, there is no dispute in prohibition [115]",

Likewise, there is also no dispute in the permissibility of men showing their hair, arms, and legs in the presence of men and in the presence of women.\" If you know this, then I say without any hesitation: Indeed, these people who are strict on women, along with their contradicting the Sharia texts and the sayings of the Imams, do not think about what comes out of their mouths or at least do not pay attention to the dimensions of their sayings. Otherwise, how can they imagine that a woman lowers her gaze from the preacher on Friday, for example, while he is preaching, or from the Mufti while she is asking him for a Fatwa? Nay, how is it possible for this Mufti and his likes from sellers not to look at her face and hands while they are dealing with her?\" So I say the truth: Indeed, these strict people say what they do not understand and act contrary to what they say. So I fear that the saying of the Lord of the Worlds will encompass them: (O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do) [As-Saff: 2]. This authentic hadith which we are in the process of repelling doubts from confirms the meaning mentioned in the two mentioned hadiths and adds to them that it declares the permissibility of a man looking at a woman's face and hands as brother Al-Iskandarani himself mentioned. But he did wrong - regrettably - twice: First: That he understood the command to lower the gaze as absolute, and it is not so as preceded from the Imams of Tafsir. And the other: That instead of interpreting the Verse of Lowering with this Hadith - as is the rule [117]",

His striking of it was in two ways: First: He assumed the authenticity of the hadith, and it is authentic in reality according to the people of knowledge who are aware of its paths and witnesses as previously verified in this Eighth Research in a way you will not find a parallel to in another book. And all credit belongs to Allah firstly and lastly. Second: His interpretation of it. That is because interpretation (Ta'wil) of any legal text is not resorted to except when reconciliation is impossible, and the matter is not so in this hadith. Scholars - despite their different specializations and schools - agreed on carrying the absolute on the restricted or the general on the specific - as preceded from Al-Qurtubi - or by the rule of excepting the less from the more as Ibn Hazm says. And to this Ash-Shawkani inclined in \"Nayl Al-Awtar\" as previously quoted from him (p. 27 - 28). Here now is what I promised you of collecting the previous sayings of scholars who declared what this authentic hadith indicated of the permissibility of a woman uncovering her face and hands and men looking at that from her without desire or suspicion, so that it becomes clear to the noble readers that some opposing Sheikhs are strict on people and deceive their readers and give the illusion that Consensus is contrary to the sayings of the scholars referred to, noting in listing them the date of their deaths so that the continuity of saying that to our day becomes clear to them as well as the continuity of practice upon it. Reminding once again that the purpose of that is only to clarify [118]\n\nwhat Allah commanded to be clarified of knowledge and forbade concealing, especially after those Sheikhs concealed it from people and inverted legal facts until that led others from the strict ones to oppose them, so one of them authored what he called \"Reminding the Companions of the Prohibition of the Niqab\". So this is in a valley and those are in a valley, and the truth is between them as I had mentioned similar to it in the introduction to the second edition of \"Al-Hijab\". So here are the names and next to them the date of death and with them their sayings:\n\n1 - Sa'id bin Jubayr (d. 95): It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to be seen by a stranger unless she has the Qina' over the Khimar and has tightened it over her head and throat (p. 51)\n\n2 - and 3 and 4 - Abu Hanifa (d. 150) and his two companions Abu Yusuf (d. 183) and Muhammad bin Al-Hasan Al-Shaybani (d. 189) and their saying will come soon\n\n5 - Malik bin Anas (d. 179): There is no harm for a woman to eat with other than a Mahram (p. 35)",

Brother Al-Iskandarani's inability to conceive this is due to his narrow-mindedness and lack of knowledge; otherwise, he would be forced to say that these eminent scholars held a view that is \"inconceivable\", and I do not think he would reach the point of accusing them of that.

The texts reported regarding it are also of two types: First: What was a report about women wearing Jilbabs in his time, peace and blessings be upon him. So whatever of this type mentions covering the face - like the hadith of Aisha in the story of Al-Ifk and similar narrations which I mentioned in the chapter \"Legitimacy of Covering the Face\" - has no relation to the research because it is merely an action that is not suitable to be an abrogator from the original rule to prohibition. This is apparent and not hidden from a fair, knowledgeable jurist, even if some Ph.D. holders were heedless of it. And the other: What was legislation containing a command contrary to what they were upon before. There is nothing of this except the verse of \"lowering the Jilbabs\" and the verse of \"drawing the Khumur over the Juyub\", and there is no evidence in them for the prohibition of uncovering the face and hands, neither linguistically nor legally, as previously verified - extensively - later.

This - by Allah - is among the most wondrous of wonders from those virtuous people, because the verse does not contain an explicit indication of the obligation of covering as I mentioned just now. If it indicates that, it is only by implication of generality (1) - it cannot be otherwise - whether in terms of the word (Jilbab) or (Idna/lowering). So the hadith shares this indication in its first part: \"If a woman reaches menstruation, it is not right for anything to be seen of her...\" for it means nothing should be seen of her. Then he added to the verse saying: \"except her face and her hands\". This is explicit that generality is not intended. If the verse was general, the hadith specifies it; otherwise, it explains it, as He, the Exalted, said: (And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them) [An-Nahl: 44].

Their likeness is only like one who might say: That the hadith: (Authentic/Sahih) \"The hand of the thief is not cut off except for a quarter of a dinar and upwards\" (Agreed upon) is abrogated by His saying, Exalted is He: ([As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands) [Al-Ma'idah: 38].

Examples of this are many, very many. Therefore, Ash-Shawkani explicitly stated the exception of the face and hands, using this hadith as evidence as previously mentioned. Then a third aspect occurred to me: It is that the mentioned interpretation would only be valid on the assumption that the proof in our issue is merely remaining on the original rule, which is permissibility. Then the mentioned interpretation would be valid. But since the reality is not so - because the discussion is about this hadith assuming its authenticity - the mentioned interpretation is invalid. For how can it be interpreted as being before Hijab or Jilbab while it is with it in prohibiting the woman from not covering with the Jilbab? Meaning: in abrogating the original rule. And it adds to the verse of Jilbab that it excepted the face and hands from it - as previously explained - and this is very clear. By this, the fall of the speech of brother Al-Iskandarani in his book (3 / 344) also becomes clear, with which he tried to support the mentioned interpretation with words he quoted from me regarding circular gold, imagining it is proof against me due to heedlessness of the difference between what is the original rule so it is abrogated by the general text, and between the abrogating text itself coupled with an exception indicating [125]",

Their likeness in that is only like one who prohibits gold absolutely and silk for women despite his exception, peace and blessings be upon him, for them from the prohibition in the authentic hadith through its paths: \"These two are forbidden for the males of my Ummah, lawful for its females,\" interpreting it as being [the rule] based on the original state. Would anyone of the people of knowledge do this? I do not think so. But these opponents have done the like of it in this hadith of ours, so they abrogated the specific with the general. And Allah's help is sought. What preceded just now is also the answer to a question posed by the one known as Ibn Khalaf in his \"Nazarat\" (p. 87). He said with extreme ignorance: Why does he not hold the jurisprudential rule: If a prohibition and a permission conflict, the prohibition is prioritized? Brother Al-Iskandarani supported him (3 / 345 - 346) with speech of no benefit, some of it related to the report abrogating the original rule - and you knew its answer - and the other to this rule. The answer is the same answer, i.e., not here. It is like the first rule related to prioritizing the report abrogating the original rule. Both rules are correct but placed in the wrong place. Whoever does not believe let him apply them to the example of silk and gold for women if he wishes. The summary of the answer to this fifth doubt: The people turned away from dealing with this hadith - assuming they accept its authenticity, and it is authentic to us - with the correct scientific Usul principles, among which is: Abrogation is not resorted to [126]",

Scholars have said: It is not lawful for anyone to say regarding a verse or hadith: They are abrogated and acting upon them is not permissible, except with a clear text or consensus. Ibn Hazm mentioned this in \"Al-Ihkam fi Usul Al-Ahkam\" and that there is consensus of scholars on it (3 / 130). He detailed that in \"Chapter on how to know the abrogated and the abrogator from what is not abrogated\" (4 / 83 - 92), so let whoever wishes refer to it for it is important. The Tenth Research: Is it obligatory upon women to cover their faces due to the corruption of the times and blocking the means (Sadd al-Dhari'ah)? I say: This question is posed today by many blind followers who do not look at Sharia issues through the lens of Sharia and its evidences, and do not refer judgment upon disagreement to the Book and the Sunnah, but rather to the opinions and ideas that have settled in their souls. If they had responded to Allah and the Messenger when He calls them to what gives them life, they would have rested and given rest. But they turned away from that and from the sayings of their Imams that they must all - men and women - lower their gazes according to the detailed explanation preceded. They resorted to imitating some imitators who came after the Imams with a cause ('illa) they innovated, which is their saying: \"on the condition of security from Fitnah\" (1) - meaning: being tempted by her - otherwise covering them is obligatory upon her.",

For what comes to mind from the word: \"The Imams\" is only the four Mujtahid Imams, and there is no knowledge from any of them that they stipulated the mentioned condition. That does not befit their knowledge as will come. Rather, the apparent meaning of what was mentioned earlier (p. 119 - 121) of their saying regarding the permissibility of looking at that from women contradicts it. Therefore, one of the great followers of Abu Hanifa from the later generations, Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Abi Sahl Abu Bakr Shams Al-A'immah As-Sarakhsi, who died around the year five hundred, did not turn to the mentioned condition. Allama Al-Lucknawi described him in \"Al-Fawa'id\" (108) as: He was an Imam, Allama, Hujjah (Proof), Mutakallim (Theologian), debater, Usuli (jurist of principles), Mujtahid. Ibn Kamal Pasha counted him among the Mujtahids in issues. I say: This As-Sarakhsi - with his leadership - explicitly stated - following Abu Hanifa and his two companions and At-Tahawi as preceded - the permissibility of looking at foreign women, even though he mentioned that the prohibition of looking is due to fear of Fitnah and that Fitnah in looking at her face is greater than at other parts of her body.

Imam Akmal Al-Din Muhammad Al-Babarti Al-Hanafi clarified in Sharh Al-Inayah 'ala Al-Hidayah \"that the indication of their saying on the face and hands is not clear. He said: Since it is apparent that the place of Kohl is the eye not the whole face, and likewise the place of the ring is the finger not the whole hand, and the claim is the permissibility of looking at the face of the foreign woman entirely and at her hands entirely. End quote. (10 / 24)\" I say: This comment and the deduction in it is wrong from several aspects: First: That it assumes the adornment mentioned in the verse is the adornment itself and not its place. This is a mistake contradicting what verifying exegetes and others are upon - as preceded (p. 27 - 32). There is no clearer proof of that than the fact that no one says it is not permissible for a woman to show her jewelry to a stranger while they are not on her body, just as no one says the opposite, i.e., that she shows their places on her body while the adornment is not on them. Second: What confirms the error is that it is impossible to see the ring on the finger except by seeing the hand. So it is proven that what is intended in the Athar is the place and not the adornment itself. [130]",

The commentator himself narrated that in another place (3 / 431). The authentic established wording from Ibn Abbas and others is: \"The face and hands\" as preceded recently, so the indication is very clear. And the other: That the one coupled with Ibn Abbas in As-Sarakhsi's phrase is Ibn Umar or Aisha - as I preferred earlier - and their wording is exactly the authentic wording from Ibn Abbas as you saw. Accordingly, it is not permissible to interpret their wording - or the wording of one of them - based on the weak wording from Ibn Abbas, as is apparent and not hidden from the people of knowledge. Thus, the mentioned deduction falls from its foundation, and it appears that the mentioned comment has no value from a scientific perspective because it is based on gathering without verification and inspection and distinguishing the authentic from the weak of narrations. Here a question poses itself - as they say today -: Why did Brother Muhammad bin Ismail prefer the weak wording over the authentic wording? The answer: From several aspects: First: Because it fits the words of Al-Babarti Al-Hanafi. Second: Because he does not know the difference between the two wordings in terms of narration (Riwayah) though he knows the difference between them in terms of understanding (Dirayah). [131]",

The Two Sheikhs (Bukhari and Muslim) extracted for him, and Ibn Abbas testified for him that he is among the scholars of the Book of Allah - as preceded (p. 50). He is the one who received from Ibn Abbas the interpretation of (Idna) by his saying: \"She lowers the Jilbab to her face and does not strike with it\" - as preceded (p. 50).

Therefore, one of them did badly when he said - to escape this apparent proof -: Perhaps the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded her after that meaning: to cover her face.

For there is nothing that he, peace and blessings be upon him, remained silent about and approved except that it is possible for every debater to invalidate it with such a saying.

So how about if he makes his contradiction a continuous rule until Allah wills? Then Ash-Shawkani, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Ibn Al-Qattan deduced from it the permissibility of looking when secure from Fitnah since he did not order her to cover her face. If Al-Abbas had not understood that looking is permissible, he would not have asked, and if what he understood was not permissible, he would not have approved him on it. Some of those who have no Fiqh answered his not commanding her, peace and blessings be upon him, to cover by saying: If he had commanded her, it would have become obligatory to cover her face, and we did not claim this. See \"Hijab Al-Adawi\" (p. 99). So I say: From your opinion for the support of which you authored your \"Hijab\" and refuted your opponent is that covering the face is obligatory upon a woman. So do you mean by your mentioned saying that [138]",

    "text": "covering is not obligatory upon the Muhrima (woman in Ihram)? If you say that - nay, you explicitly stated that (p. 97) - then you have come with an innovated saying contradicting the way of the believers. For we do not know anyone from the people of knowledge who said covering is obligatory as a principle while not obligatory on the Muhrima even during Fitnah. Otherwise, those you follow would not have needed to fabricate various answers to escape the apparent indication of the hadith on the invalidity of their saying of obligation. The invalidity of those aspects has already been explained on pages (41 - 43 and 135 - 136). Despite this contradiction of all scholars, he contradicted himself once again. For he asserted (p. 81) that it is binding on the slave girl to cover her face if Fitnah is feared as blocking the means (Sadd al-Dhari'ah), while the principle according to him is that it is not binding on her. Yet here he did not say it is binding on the free woman with the realization of fear, while the principle is that it is obligatory upon her according to him. Is this not form the vacillation in the religion of Allah which Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him, forbade? (1) To escape the apparent indication of the hadith which great scholars stated explicitly and proceeded upon until today as previously verified. And Allah's help is sought. The summary of the speech: Fitnah with women existed in the time of revelation to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and because of that Allah Almighty legislated rulings for both sexes - blocking the means - as previously indicated. If Allah Almighty had willed to obligate women to cover their faces before strangers, He would have done so blocking the means as well (And never is",

And He would have revealed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, to command the Khath'amiyyah woman to cover her face, for this is the time of clarification as preceded. But on the contrary, he, peace and blessings be upon him, wanted to clarify to people in that great scene that blocking the means here is not by prohibiting what Allah made lawful for women to uncover their faces if they wished, but rather by applying the rule: (...lower their gazes) and that by turning Al-Fadl's gaze away from the woman. In my critique, there is no difference between these blind followers obligating women to cover their faces - blocking the means as they claimed - and if someone were to say: It is obligatory upon men to cover their faces - as is the case of the veiled men (Mulaththamun) in some countries - so that women are not tempted by looking at them, blocking the means as well. This is like that. Whoever differentiates has contradicted himself and been biased towards men over women, since they are all partners in the obligation of lowering the gaze. So whoever adds a new ruling on the other without proof from Allah and His Messenger has transgressed and wronged (And Allah does not love the wrongdoers) [Al-Imran: 57]. Here I recall a verse of poetry as if a female jurist represents herself with it saying: Another sinned and I am the punished among you So I am like the index finger of the remorseful And perhaps it is superfluous to mention: That the bulk of this research is with those blind followers who contradicted their Imams in this issue - and the Book and Sunnah with them - and whom the blind followers see as obligatory to imitate because their sayings for the imitators are like the evidences of the Book and Sunnah for the Mujtahids.

But here they have agreed on contradicting the Book and Sunnah on one hand and the sayings of their Imams on the other. They added to that - insult to injury - so they imitated those whom it is not permissible for them to imitate because they are imitators like them and from their later generations as preceded. And blind following (Taqlid) is not knowledge by agreement of the people of knowledge as Ibn al-Qayyim said in \"I'lam Al-Muwaqqi'in\" (1 / 51 and 2 293). Abu Al-Hasan As-Sindi narrated in the beginning of his \"Hashiyah on Ibn Majah\" from As-Suyuti: That the imitator is not called a scholar. Therefore, Al-Marghinani Al-Hanafi called him in \"Sharh Al-Hidayah\" (6 / 359) \"The Ignorant\" and narrated the disagreement regarding the permissibility of appointing him to judgeship. Ibn Al-Humam narrated in \"Fath Al-Qadir\" from Imam Muhammad: That the imitator is not permitted to be a judge. How excellent is the example Imam Shafi'i struck for the imitator when he said: The likeness of the one who seeks knowledge without proof is like a wood gatherer at night carrying a bundle of wood in which is a snake biting him and he does not know. Al-Bayhaqi reported it in \"Al-Madkhal\" (210 - 211) with an authentic chain from him (1).

Refer to \"Fath Al-Bari\" (13 / 282 - 290) if you wish, for he elaborated on its explanation and clarification of its benefits, and that the intended meaning of his saying: \"ignorant heads\": is only the blind followers. And the reality in most Islamic countries is a confirmation of this authentic hadith, including what we are dealing with. And Allah's help is sought. Then I say: If those blind followers had any knowledge, they would not have obligated women to cover their faces out of fear that men would be tempted by them while saying: That the principle is the permissibility of unveiling. They would have said: If a woman fears that harm will befall her from some evil men because of her unveiling, then she should not unveil, blocking the means. If they had said this, it would have been acceptable jurisprudence. But to impose that on women generally in every time and place is legislation for which Allah has sent down no authority. Therefore, no scholar of Islam has said it; rather, they said the opposite as we presented from Qadi Iyad, An-Nawawi, Ibn Muflih and other eminent scholars [142]\n\nSummary of the Previous Researches: To summarize what preceded, I say: The following facts have become clear to the noble readers from these enlightening researches:\n\n1 - That those who say it is obligatory for a woman to cover her face and hands do not have a text for that from the Book or Sunnah or Consensus, nay, they do not even have a single authentic explicit narration from the Salaf that must be followed, except for some general or absolute texts which the Sunnah undertook to explain, and the Ummah did not act upon their absolute and general nature. Some of them excepted the face and hands, some excepted half the face, some excepted the eyes from the face, and some excepted one eye. The first group are the most guided by the Book and Sunnah.\n\n2 - Their interpretation of (Al-Khimar), (Al-Idna), (Al-Jilbab), and (Al-I'tijar) contrary to the Prophetic Hadiths, Salafi Athars, and linguistic texts, and even contrary to their interpretation of the verse of women past child-bearing age (Al-Qawa'id).\n\n3 - Their use of weak Hadiths and flimsy and fabricated Athars as evidence for that, whether they know or do not know.",

If the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Good only brings good.\" Agreed upon. Then likewise strictness is evil that only brings evil. Therefore, Hadiths multiplied and their wordings varied in warning against it. He said, peace and blessings be upon him: (Authentic/Sahih) First: \"Religion is ease, and no one overburdens himself in religion except that it overcomes him. So aim for what is right and approach it...\" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (No. 39). (Authentic/Sahih) Second: \"Beware of excess in religion, for those before you were destroyed by excess in religion.\" Narrated by the authors of the Sahihs: Ibn Khuzaimah, Ibn Hibban, Al-Hakim, Al-Diya' and others, and it is extracted in \"As-Sahihah\" (1283). (Authentic/Sahih) Third: \"Do not be strict on yourselves, for those before you were destroyed by their strictness on themselves, and you will find their remnants in hermitages and monasteries.\" Al-Bukhari extracted it in \"Al-Tarikh\" and others, and I extracted it in \"As-Sahihah\" (3124). If the matter is so, then the noble readers must have noticed this strictness embodied in what we recounted of their sayings and opinions, among which is their saying: \"even her fingernail\" and in prayer as well, and what they burdened themselves with in rejecting definitive evidences of the practice of uncovering the face in the centuries witnessed for with goodness, and the testimony of the virtuous Companions [146]",

So I say: Despite that, Sheikh At-Tuwaijri misleads those who hold this saying - as quoted from him earlier (p. 8) - rather he makes that from heresy in the verses of Allah... (p. 49). Then he is not ashamed to claim Consensus that the woman's face is 'awrah while he himself mentions that the majority of scholars hold otherwise - as preceded (p. 32). His followers in this strictness are many, regrettably. This is from the scientific aspect which everyone who stands on their statements shares with us in knowing. As for the practical aspect, the matter is very strange. Three examples have become available to me: First: A brother-in-law told me that he intended to visit a virtuous Sheikh from those strict ones, but he did not celebrate him nor receive him because his wife was uncovering her face, even though her Hijab was Sharia-compliant in all aspects. And this Sheikh is known for his humility and good manners. So where is this from the saying of Imam Ahmed preceded (p. 9): It is not appropriate for the Faqih to compel people to his Madhhab?

Third: In the mentioned year - after Umrah - it was destined for me to visit the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. I gave some lectures there and answered the questions of male and female questioners in writing and by phone. It reached me about some committed women among them that when the hadith: \"The Muhrima does not wear Niqab...\" reached them, they said: We wear Niqab and do not uncover our faces and we pay Fidyah (ransom).

Is it possible for women who were raised on the fear of falling into sin - if she prayed or performed Hajj with her face and hands uncovered - to undertake such actions while wearing Niqab and gloves? No, by my Lord, for that is impossible except by uncovering their faces and hands, and what is not permissible usually might become uncovered from them as the Exalted said: (except what appears thereof).

He ate, and we ate with him. Then he performed ablution for the Zhuhr prayer and prayed. The woman said: 'O Messenger of Allah, we have a leftover from our sheep, would you like dinner?' He said: 'Yes.' So he ate, and we ate, then he prayed Asr and did not perform ablution.\" Extracted by Abu Ya'la in his \"Musnad\" (4 / 116 / 2160) and At-Tahawi in \"Sharh Al-Ma'ani\" (1 / 39) via the path of Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir from him. I say: And its chain is authentic. And Al-Humaidi in his \"Musnad\" (533 / 1266) via the path of Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Aqil: That he heard Jabir bin Abdullah with a similar narration, more complete than it, and the addition belongs to him. I say: Its chain is Hasan. From this path, Ahmad also extracted it (3 / 374 - 375) similarly without the addition. (Note): The commentator on \"Abu Ya'la\" expanded excessively in extracting the hadith and attributing it to Abdur-Razzaq, the authors of the Sunan, Ibn Hibban, and others, giving the impression that they all have it with this completeness found in Abu Ya'la, which is not the case. Rather, they have the eating the first time, ablution, then Zhuhr prayer, eating the other time, then Asr prayer without ablution. It is extracted in \"Sahih Abi Dawood\" (186) [151]",

So how would their condition be if reality imposed that upon them, such as self-defense, as Umm Sulaym (may Allah be pleased with her) did when she took a dagger on the day of Hunayn, and similar to what Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them both) did",

So they were as Allah Almighty said: {You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah} [Al Imran: 110], and He said: {And thus we have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you} [Al-Baqarah: 143]. Upon this noble Prophetic methodology, the Sheikhs and preachers must raise people, men and women. They will not be able to do that unless they acquaint themselves with the authentic Sunnah and Prophetic biography, which includes: his saying, action, approval, and what our righteous predecessors were upon from what is authentically reported from them. For the Fiqh (understanding) of a scholar is not upright except with all of this, seeking help in that from the sayings of the Mujtahid Imams and the verifying scholars, otherwise he deviates from the truth and the path of the believers. How excellent is Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) when he drew attention to this - and it is among his precious gems which I have not seen from others - in his previous statement (p. 48): \"And what is transmitted from the Salaf and the scholars requires knowledge of the establishment of its wording and its indication, just as what is transmitted from Allah and His Messenger requires that.\" [156]",

At-Tuwayjiri quoted this with admiration saying (p. 154): \"And there is no addition to it.\" This is from his stubbornness and denial of scientific facts, for he knows that Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar has invalidated these sayings and proven that this was years after Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) reached puberty. So you must see \"Fath al-Bari\" (1 / 550 and 443 - 445). From that is their interpretation of the hadith of Fatimah bint Qais (may Allah be pleased with her) - as previously explained (p. 46 - 47) - for it indicates the permissibility of her looking at foreign guests and their looking at her, meaning: at her face. Therefore, Al-Qurtubi in his \"Tafsir\" made it specific to the generality of His saying Almighty: {And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision} [An-Nur: 31]. With it and the hadith of Aisha, the senior Hanbali scholars from the Maqdisis and others argued - as preceded (p. 66) - for the permissibility of a woman looking at other than the 'Awrah of a man. This might be among the agreed-upon matters provided desire is absent. For I saw Al-Hafiz Ibn al-Qattan saying in his book (Folio 64 / 1): \"There is no disagreement I know of regarding the permissibility of a woman looking at the face of a man whatever he may be, if she does not intend pleasure and does not fear temptation, like a man looking at the faces of boys and beardless youths if",
