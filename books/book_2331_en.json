To proceed: This is the book 'Al-'Ilal wa Ma'rifat al-Rijal' by Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him. I have exerted my utmost effort in investigating, correcting, and extracting its references. I have prefaced it with an introduction containing a summary regarding the knowledge of narrators (Rijal) and the criticism and praise (Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil), then I mentioned what relates to the defects ('Ilal), then I wrote a biography for Imam Ahmad, a brief biography, and then I mentioned the description of the book and the manuscript upon which the work was based. I pray to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, to accept it with a good acceptance. And I hope from the brothers, the people of knowledge, that they kindly draw attention to any error they observe so that it can be corrected later. And they shall have their reward with Allah.

We seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our own selves and from our bad deeds. Whomever Allah guides, there is none to misguide him, and whomever He leaves astray, there is no guide for him. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, having no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. To proceed: Verily, the best discourse is the Book of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The worst of matters are newly invented ones, and every newly invented matter is a bid'ah (innovation), and every bid'ah is a misguidance. Allah created Adam, peace be upon him, and created from him his wife, and dispersed from both of them many men and women. He ordained for them laws which He charged them with through the tongues of His Messengers, from the time of Adam to the Seal of the Prophets, our Prophet Muhammad, upon him and upon the Prophets be blessings and peace. Allah sent His Messengers to convey to their people the messages of Allah, living among them, explaining to them the commands and prohibitions of Allah through their words and deeds, which their people and followers preserved from them and acted upon. Thus, the Messengers of Allah came in succession. And no Messenger was sent except in the language of his people, so He leaves astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. A Prophet from the previous Prophets used to be sent to his people specifically, but our Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was sent to mankind generally, so Allah made his message an abrogator of all messages, so",

(And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner) (2). Since the previous religions were not destined by Allah to remain forever, He did not undertake to preserve them, nor did He prepare for them those who would undertake their care and maintenance. Thus, they were not safe from distortion, even their holy books revealed to them. That is by the testimony of the Great Quran.

And He denounced them in His saying, the Exalted: (So woe to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from Allah,\" in order to exchange it for a small price) (4). As for our Hanif (Monotheistic) White Sharia, Allah has promised and undertaken by His bounty and mercy to preserve it. The Exalted said: (Indeed, it is We who sent down the Dhikr [i.e., the Quran] and indeed, We will be its guardian) (5).

With this blessed mission, Allah sent our Prophet, so he conveyed the message, fulfilled the trust, and strove for Allah with the striving due to Him. He defeated the enemies—polytheists, disbelieving hypocrites, and Jews—so the Peninsula believed in him. Among them were those who submitted (became Muslim) and pretended, while their hearts did not believe, just as he conquered the most malicious of nations, the bitterest enemies of Islam, the sons of apes and pigs, the Jews who did not leave an opportunity without seizing it to plot against Islam and the Muslims. Their leadership turned away from Medina with its malice, cunning, and hatred, and set up camp in Khaybar, exiled, expelled, condemned, and defeated. People lived under the shade of a mercy to the worlds until the religion was completed and the favor of Allah was perfected upon His servants in the form of His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in its entirety. If a calamity befell them, they returned to it, or if an incident occurred to them, they sought refuge in it. They lived in mutual love and mercy like a single body, among Muslims like the teeth of a comb, with no disagreement or schism, and between exposed enemies, and between hypocrites whom, whenever they kindled the fire of fitnah (sedition), Allah inspired His Prophet so he exposed them and revealed their defects. And the victory belongs to the religion of Allah; the good is dominant and clear, and the evil has hidden and almost ceased to exist. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, spoke the truth: \"The best of people are my generation...\" (1). The victory of Allah and the conquest came, and people entered the religion of Allah in multitudes. Allah gave His Prophet the choice between the world and what is with Him, so he chose what is with Allah (2) and passed on to the Highest Companion (Al-Rafiq Al-A'la), pleased and pleasing. The people had barely felt the interruption of news from the heaven and buried the best of creation in the pure soil of Taybah (Medina), when the clattering of the chains of trials rattled in their ears upon the stones of tribulations. The hypocrites and the malicious Jews found an outlet and a breath for their buried hatred, and the ambitious youth flocked with them, those with greed whose hearts the cheerfulness of faith had not mixed with.",

    "text": "the depths of their hearts were of those whose eyes had not been anointed with the light of Prophethood. So they denied a great pillar from the pillars of Islam: Zakat. Thus, the first back-breaking event occurred, the tribulation of the apostates. Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq undertook the burden of the Rightly Guided Caliphate, and he broke the back of the sedition with determination and a sharp resolve. Al-Siddiqah Aisha, daughter of Al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with them both, describes this situation: 'The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, passed away, and the Arabs apostatized. Hypocrisy raised its head in Medina. Had what descended upon my father descended upon the unshakable mountains, it would have crushed them. By Allah, they did not differ regarding a single point but that my father flew with its fortune and burden in Islam.' Narrated by Imam Ahmad in 'Fada'il al-Sahabah'. He was the Siddiq of this Ummah and its best for this tribulation; he repelled the plot of Satan back to his throat, and the ship of Islam settled upon the Judi of safety, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. He fulfilled his vow and met his Lord. Then the Rightly Guided Caliphate of Umar was established, the caliphate of the Muhaddath (inspired one), the one inspired for good, the one who knew people best, so he governed them with the wisdom of the insightful believer and the overwhelming strength of faith. His whip did its work, repelling the deviators from their deviation. He opened vast horizons for occupying people with Jihad and calling to Allah. He busied them with their Lord rather than themselves, and people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, between the obedient believer, the fearful hypocrite, and the hateful one lying in wait. They conspired among themselves and prepared for him a crow from the crows of disbelief, so he pecked him a peck or two and killed him while he was preparing himself for the Fajr prayer. Thus, they bereaved Islam of a genius. Then the caliphate of Dhu Al-Nurayn (Possessor of Two Lights) was established, the modest one of this Ummah and its forbearing one. He was the most connecting of them to his kin and the most fearing of them for his Lord, as stated by Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. The days of his caliphate were the most flourishing days of the Rightly Guided Caliphate in terms of prosperity and security. During it, Jihad went east and west and sailed the seas.",

But the Fitna (sedition) did not sleep; rather, it dug for itself an entrance into the fortress of Islam where it laid eggs and hatched. Its chicks flew here and there, building their nests in the capitals of Islam and its cities, fed by the most evil of Allah's creation: The Saba'iyyah Jews. The corrupters fabricated lies against Dhu Al-Nurayn and wove falsehoods around him. His forbearance and noble nature encouraged them to do so, so they slaughtered him in his house while he was reciting the Book of Allah, just as lambs are slaughtered. Uthman bin Affan, may Allah be pleased with him and have mercy on him, was martyred in the house of the Messenger and his city. The sanctities of the Caliphate were violated in the most hideous manner. The Fitna stood up, exposed and active, and disagreement and discord raised their heads. The landmarks became obscured for some of the virtuous companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. The unity of the Muslims did not return since they bade it farewell on that tempting, tempted day. In this suffocating, dark atmosphere, the foster son of Prophethood and the hero of Jihad, the cousin of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, undertook the command of the Caliphate. And what a task this Rightly Guided Caliph undertook! The Muslims pledged allegiance to him while they were divided, a division whose gaps increased every day; if one gap was closed, others opened before him. People from among the Muslims raised the sword in his face, and a group of virtuous ones fought him—he did not deny their virtue. The Islamic society cracked open to reveal the harshest of sects, the Kharijites, who fought him with a fierce war. On the other side, brothers of his in Islam fought him, whose Islam he did not deny, but he said of them: 'They are our brothers who have transgressed against us.' Another sect emerged from the children of Saba and his chicks, the Shia, who claimed to love him and exaggerated regarding him until they deified him. They displayed love for the family of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and spread among the people that they were oppressed, oppressed by the Sahaba, headed by Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman. So they made it their habit to curse the Sahaba and declare them disbelievers. The enemies of Islam conspired, and Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, was martyred by a sinful hand after he had spent",

The Mother of the Believers, Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, spoke the truth when news of the martyrdom of Ali, may Allah honor his face, reached her, quoting this poetry: 'She dropped her staff and the destination settled her * As the traveler is delighted by the return.' (1) The Caliphate then united, after the resignation of Al-Hassan bin Ali, upon Muawiyah, may Allah be pleased with them both. The division lightened in its intensity, and he governed it with forbearance, patience, wisdom, and endurance. The matter had some calmness and tranquility, though no day passes but that the one after it is worse than it. And the Fitna, even if it was disturbing the inside of the Islamic society, the outside remained formidable due to the blessing of the righteous among the general Muslims and their righteousness. For goodness was the controlling factor in their behavior, their attachment to Allah Almighty, and their undertaking of the call to Allah. How could they not be, when they are the companions of the Messenger of Allah, whom the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, raised with his behavior and methodology? They did not forget their duties in commanding the good and forbidding the evil. Then the Tabi'in (Successors) to the companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, took over the matter. They were raised in the laps of the Sahaba and received the guidance and the way of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, from them, and they undertook spreading it among the people. So the spirit of Islam was awake and insightful, and the Islamic society was feared in the eyes of the vindictive enemies, externally and internally. The soldiers of Islam, in the shadow of these internal tribulations, continued to raid and open the hearts of the servants and their lands, spreading the call to Allah. They taught people the Book and Wisdom. The ship of Islam continued to cleave through the waves of internal tribulations alongside Jihad in the path of Allah. The expanse of the Islamic lands widened until it reached the heart of Africa and the gates of Europe and China. Sincere, obedient people entered the religion of Allah, as well as people whose desires aligned with the desire of the Saba'iyyah in every era, so they connected with their clique—the way of Allah regarding those who passed away before.",

    "text": "When sects emerged and desires differed, lying against the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, became widespread among some factions, because everyone knew well that the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, is the most precious thing to Muslims. So the fabrication of Hadiths began to strengthen desires and opinions. Just as distortion and unjust interpretation of some verses from the Book of Allah began. So the Muslims undertook the preservation of these two sources with all means and capabilities. True history bears witness that the Muslims recognized the value of these two sources—the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger—and that they are the cause of every Muslim's happiness and the source of guidance for every believer. It is known from human nature that precious and valuable goods are preserved and protected with exaggerated care using every possible means. The more the value increases, the more the care in preserving it increases. So they undertook the preservation of the Book of Allah in the chests (hearts) and then in the Mushafs between the two covers. They also undertook the preservation of the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, by heart, then by recording it in collections, then by verifying and authenticating it. Muslim narrated in the introduction to his Sahih (15) from Ibn Sirin who said: 'They did not used to ask about the Isnad (chain of narration), but when the Fitna occurred, they said: Name your men to us. So they would look at Ahl Al-Sunnah and take their Hadith, and they would look at Ahl Al-Bid'ah (people of innovation) and not take their Hadith.' And by the success granted by Allah, they deduced sciences to serve it that humanity had not known in its long history, not even a tenth of a tenth of what the Muslims have. Look at those many sciences of Tajweed, Tafsir and its principles, Grammar, Morphology, Rhetoric, and then the Terminology of Sunnah (Mustalah). In every art, there are arts and branches, all to serve these two noble sources. Yes, it is from the miracle of this eternal religion that Allah created for it a people who were the cream of humanity and its extract, and they are the companions of Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, who undertook the support of their Prophet, his veneration, his respect, and the sacrifice of their souls and wealth at the signal of his blessed glance. There is no equal to them in any nation among the nations.",

While the authentic Seerah (biography) tells us that the companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, one of them said: 'O Messenger of Allah: By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if you commanded us to plunge into the sea, we would plunge into it, and if you commanded us to strike the livers of camels (travel) to Bark al-Ghimad, we would do so' (1) ... They undertook the preservation of this religion from their Prophet and transmitted it to those after them with complete justice and total trustworthiness. It is not hidden from one familiar with the history of Muslims the effort that the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, undertook to collect the Noble Quran in a universally agreed-upon Mushaf. Thus, the collection of the Noble Quran and its recording was completed in the era of the best of this Ummah. We believe that it exists in our hands, fresh and tender as Allah revealed it to His Messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, preserved in the chests of the young and old of this Ummah without distortion or misspelling affecting it. As for the Prophetic Sunnah, although much of it was recorded in the time of the Sahaba, its greater reliance was on memorization, and it was not recorded in a complete recording like the Noble Quran. So the mission of the Tabi'in and those after them began, and they undertook miraculous efforts to collect the Hadiths of their Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. In this field, they set magnificent examples that indicate the miraculous nature of this Hanif (monotheistic) religion. 'They preferred traversing wastelands and deserts over luxury in homes and homelands, seeking Sunan in the regions, collecting them with anxiety and travels, and circulating in all districts.

The journey of the Muhaddithin (Hadith scholars) to seek Sunan and Athar (traditions) was a confirmation of His Almighty's saying: (For there should separate from every division of them a group [of religious scholars] to obtain understanding in the religion) (2). For regarding the companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, one of them would travel to seek a single Hadith or merely for verification, covering a vast distance, enduring every hardship in this path. Abdullah bin Buraidah said that a man from the companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, traveled to Fadalah bin Ubaid while he was in Egypt. He came to him while he was extending a camel of his. He said: 'Welcome.' He said: 'Indeed, I did not come to you as a visitor, but I and you heard a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and I hoped that you might have knowledge of it.' He said: 'What is it?' He said: 'Such and such...' And Jabir bin Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrates to us the story of his journey, saying: 'A Hadith reached me regarding the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, which I had not heard. So I bought a camel, saddled it, and traveled for a month until I reached the Levant (Sham). I came to Abdullah bin Unays. I said to the doorman: Tell him Jabir is at the door. He said: He went to him and said to him: Jabir bin Abdullah? He came to me and said to me. I said to him: Yes. So he returned and informed him. He stood up, dragging his garment, until he met me and embraced me and I embraced him. I said: A Hadith reached me from you that you heard from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, regarding Qisas (retaliation), which I did not hear. I feared that you might die or I might die before I hear it. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him...' and he mentioned it.",

He said: 'Wake him up.' They said: 'Rather, we will leave him until he wakes up.' He said: 'I will not do so.' So they woke Maslamah for him. He welcomed him and said: 'Descend (be a guest).' He said: 'No, until you send for Uqbah bin Amir for a need I have with him.' So he sent for Uqbah, and he came. He said: 'Did you hear the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, say: Whoever finds a Muslim upon a fault and covers him, it is as if he brought to life a buried female infant from her grave?' Uqbah said: 'I have heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, say that' (1). And the Tabi'in followed them with excellence, so they traveled and collected the Sunan from the regions and cities. Then those who followed them with excellence until the Sunnah was fully recorded in the collections (Diwans) that we see filling the libraries of the world. They did not suffice with collection only, but they used every means to purify it from impurities and turbidities. They established rules for it that are the most sophisticated the world has known and the best that human capacity has reached to verify news and authenticate it. Look at the books of Mustalah Al-Hadith (Hadith Terminology) and the types of Hadith sciences therein; you will see what no eye has seen nor ear has heard the likes of before Islam.

    "text": "the Noble Quran mentioned to us the biographies of many notables, and the points of lesson in them are clear, free from contradiction and impossibilities. Look beside it at the myths and false stories in the books of those before us. The Quran also teaches us that it is not enough to simply record biographies and adhere to truthfulness in them only, but honest criticism must also be directed for the sake of lesson and admonition. Look at examples of that in the story of Adam, Noah, and Yunus, peace be upon them. From this noble Quranic starting point, the People of Hadith (Ahl al-Hadith), may Allah have mercy on them, directed themselves. They exerted their utmost efforts and strove until they collected the biography of the Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and his Sunnah—in speech, action, and approval—with their chains of narration (Asanid). Were it not for that great effort from this blessed group, we would have been deprived of knowing the conditions of our Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and it would have been impossible for us to comply with His Almighty's saying: (There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern) (1). Their efforts did not stop at these limits; they also recorded correct, truthful biographies of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, acting upon his saying, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, in the Hadith of Irbad bin Sariyah: '...So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Mahdi Caliphs, bite onto it with your molars' (2). And they took steps to collect the biographies of others from the Sahaba. How could they neglect the biographies of the companions of their Prophet when Allah has purified them and praised them, and in their lives, there is news and lessons for us? The books authored specifically about them indicate the efforts expended in this aspect. And since a report—any report—is not trusted and is not acceptable unless",

Therefore, they devised the word 'Isnad' with their special terminology and devised a special science for it known as the science of Criticism, Disparagement, and Praise (Jarh wa Ta'dil). They wrote biographies for the Tabi'in and those after them, and recorded their conditions so that the weak could be known from the hafiz, and the trustworthy from the liar; those whose reports are accepted and those whose Hadiths are rejected. If you see the books of biographies, histories, and generations (Tabaqat), then you see thousands of biographies with everything they reached regarding the narrator's birth, his upbringing until his death, how his entrance and exit were, how he was in his behavior, religion, creed, and dealings with others. Who were his sheikhs from whom he learned? Did he hear all his Hadiths or some of them? Who were the students who received from him? Who are the trustworthy students from him and those whose narrations from him are weak? What is the number of his narrations? How many of them are authentic and how many are weak? Did he remain in his memory and probity as he was in his youth and health, or did he become confused (mixed up) in his later years after he grew old and aged, or after he was afflicted with a disability or an incident in himself or his books? And did he narrate during his state of confusion or not? If he narrated, then who are those who took from him before the confusion, and who are those who took from him after the confusion? And (regarding) those who took before the confusion and after it as well, were their Hadiths distinguished or not? And other such attributes related to the narrator. This is what is known as the Science of the Knowledge of Men (Ilm Ma'rifat al-Rijal) or the Science of Jarh wa Ta'dil. Even the enemies of Islam were dazzled by these sciences, and some of them spoke in praise of it and them, admitting the virtue as witnessed by enemies. Dr. Sprenger said in the introduction to the book 'Al-Isabah': 'The Muslims have the right to take pride in the Science of Men (Rijal) as they wish. For no nation has existed'",

It is possible for us to obtain the biographies of five hundred famous scholars from their books.' End quote (1). The People of Hadith did not limit themselves to collecting biographies; rather, they researched minutely into their narrations, even the narrations of the known trustworthy ones among them. They did not rely on the fact that they were trustworthy and exempt them from research and criticism. For a trustworthy person may have an illusion or make a mistake; it is the nature that Allah created people with. So they researched their narrations in which they had illusions or made mistakes. This is what is known as the Science of Hadith Defects (Ilal al-Hadith). Is it possible, O friend, for there to be methods for research, criticism, verification, and inspection of past news better than what the Muhaddithin have? No. 'Those are my fathers, so bring me the likes of them * If the gatherings gather us, O Jarir.' Besides that, they deduced rulings without unjust analogy or being restricted to the literal meaning. They wrote Jami's (comprehensive collections), Sunan, and thematic books on this. Just as they protected the sanctuary of the Creed (Aqidah) from all its sides. They did not hear a frightening noise but that they flew to it, light and heavy. They did not see a breach but that they garrisoned in it. So they preserved this religion from the deviation of the deviators, the distortion of the extremists, the plagiarism of the falsifiers, and the misguidance of the anthropomorphists, the negators, the describers of modality, and the interpreters. It saddens us after this that some of those hateful towards the Salaf or Salafiyyah stand up and accuse them of not understanding the texts and belittle them, calling them 'Transmitters' (Naqalah) who do not understand.

    "text": "A Brief Summary on Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil (Criticism and Praise)\nSpeaking about men (narrators) by way of criticism and praise is not backbiting; rather, it is one of the duties of the Sharia. Ibn Hibban narrated in the book *Al-Du'afa wa Al-Majruhin* (The Weak and The Criticized) from 'Abd al-Rahman bin 'Amr al-Sulami and Hujr al-Kala'i, who said: We came to Al-'Irbad bin Sariyah, and he was among those about whom the verse was revealed: {Nor [is there blame] upon those who, when they came to you that you might give them mounts...} [to the end of the verse]. I said: 'I do not find that which I can carry you on.' So we greeted him and said: 'We have come to you as visitors and seekers of knowledge.' Al-'Irbad said: 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, led us in the Fajr prayer one day, then he turned his face towards us and admonished us with an eloquent admonition that caused eyes to shed tears and hearts to tremble. A speaker said: \"O Messenger of Allah, this looks like the admonition of a farewell; so what do you entrust to us?\" He said: \"I enjoin you to have Taqwa (fear/consciousness) of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, and to listen and obey, even if [your leader is] an Abyssinian slave with mutilated limbs. For indeed, whoever among you lives long will see much difference (disagreement). So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs; hold fast to it and bite onto it with your molars. And beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a bid'ah (innovation), and every bid'ah is misguidance.\"' Then he [Ibn Hibban] said: \"In his saying, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'For indeed, whoever among you lives long will see much difference. So adhere...' is evidence that he, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded his nation to know the weak [narrators] from the trustworthy ones. This is because sticking to the Sunnah, given the lies and falsehoods that have mixed with it, is not possible except by knowing the weak from the trustworthy. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, knew what would happen regarding this in his nation.\" He also said: \"In his saying, peace be upon him, 'Let the one present among you convey to the absent,'",

Ahmad bin Marwan Al-Maliki narrated to us: Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal told us, saying: Abu Turab Al-Nakhshabi came to my father, and my father started saying: 'So-and-so is weak, and so-and-so is trustworthy.' Abu Turab said: 'O Sheikh, do not backbite the scholars.' He said: My father turned to him and said: 'Woe to you! This is advice (nasihah); this is not backbiting.' And Muhammad bin Bundar said: I said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: 'It is difficult for me to say: So-and-so is weak, so-and-so is a liar.' Ahmad said: 'If you remain silent and I remain silent, then when will the ignorant person know the authentic from the defective?' (2). Abu Bakr bin Khallad said: I entered upon Yahya bin Sa'id during his illness, and he said to me: 'O Abu Bakr, have I left the people of Basra talking?' I said: 'They mention good things, except that they fear for you because of your speech regarding people.' He said: 'Memorize this from me: For my adversary in the Hereafter to be a man from the common people is more beloved to me than for my adversary in the Hereafter to be the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying: \"A hadith reached you about me which you suspected was not from me, yet you did not deny it?\"' (3). Indeed, the Holy Quran itself urges verification, research, and scrutiny. The Exalted said: (O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate) (4). We also find in the Book of Allah, the Exalted, principles for criticism (Naqd), wounding (Jarh), and modification/praise (Ta'dil).

Al-Bukhari narrated from Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, when the people of the slander (Al-Ifk) said what they said about her. She said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called for Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid, may Allah be pleased with them both, when the Revelation was delayed, asking them and consulting them about separating from his family. As for Usama, he advised with what he knew of the innocence of his family. As for Ali, he said: 'Allah has not restricted you, and women other than her are many; ask the maidservant, she will tell you the truth.' So he [the Prophet] said: 'Have you seen anything that makes you doubt?' She said: 'I have not seen a matter more than that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family' (4). He has many examples in the Sunnah. Then came the turn of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them; they examined, inspected, and went to great lengths in investigating the hadiths of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

Abu Bakr said: 'Is there anyone else with you?' So Muhammad bin Maslamah Al-Ansari stood up and said: 'The same as Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah said.' So Abu Bakr executed it for her (1). Then comes the turn of the second Caliph, Umar bin Al-Khattab, and he is stricter than his predecessor. From Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, who said: I was in one of the gatherings of the Ansar when Abu Musa came looking terrified. He said: 'I asked permission to enter upon Umar, but permission was not granted to me, so I returned.' He [Umar] said: 'What prevented you?' I said: 'I asked permission three times and it was not granted, so I returned, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: \"If one of you asks permission three times and it is not granted, he should return.\"' He [Umar] said: 'By Allah, you must establish proof for this. Did any of you hear it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' Ubayy bin Ka'b said: 'By Allah, none shall stand with you except the youngest of the people.' I was the youngest of the people, so I stood with him and informed Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said that. And in some narrations: Umar said: 'I merely heard something and I wanted to verify it.' And in a narration, Umar bin Al-Khattab said to Abu Musa: 'Note that I did not accuse you, but I feared that people would attribute sayings to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace' (2). Ibn 'Abd al-Barr narrated with his chain from Abu Hurairah who said: 'Indeed, this knowledge is religion, so look to whom you take it from.'

The art advances with rapid steps, new laws are established, and Allah brings forth the likes of Shu'bah. They travel, inspect, and test the conditions of the men (narrators), and they begin classifying and authoring more broadly than before. Looking at the biography of Shu'bah reveals that he was extremely excessive in verifying what he narrated, and he would not narrate except from those known to be trustworthy, as it is said. He had different methods for verifying reports, among them: He was not satisfied with listening to a hadith just once. Ibn Abi Hatim narrated with his chain to Hammad bin Zaid who said: 'I do not care who opposes me if Shu'bah agrees with me, because Shu'bah was not satisfied to hear a hadith once; he would have its owner repeat it multiple times, while we, if we heard it once, would be sufficient with it' (2). Among his methods is what Ibn Abi Hatim narrated with his chain to Abu Dawud Al-Tayalisi who said: I heard Khalid bin Taliq asking Shu'bah, saying: 'O Abu Bistam, narrate to me the hadith of Simak bin Harb regarding the exchange of silver for gold, the hadith of Ibn Umar.' He said: 'May Allah reform you. This is a hadith that no one raises [to the Prophet] except Simak.' He said: 'So do you fear that I will narrate it from you?'

    "text": "Hind narrated it to me from Sa'id bin Jubayr and did not raise it, but Simak raised it, so I distinguish it' (1). So Shu'bah showed through this comparison that Simak erred in raising this hadith; rather, it is from the saying of Ibn Umar, stopped (Mawquf) at him. Such methods of verification and investigation are frequently narrated from the followers of the Tabi'un. In this century, the good, the critics of the art emerged, such as Sufyan Al-Thawri [97 - 161], Malik bin Anas the Imam of the Abode of Migration [104 - 179], Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak Al-Marwazi Al-Khurasani [118 - 181], Abu Is-haq Al-Fazari [d. 186], Sufyan bin 'Uyaynah [107 - 197], Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Qattan [120 - 198], Waki' bin Al-Jarrah [128 - 198], and Abdur-Rahman bin Mahdi [135 - 198]. Then Allah brought another people who studied under these noble, blessed notables. They took their methods in research and exploration and added new methods to them. At the forefront of them were Ahmad bin Hanbal, Yahya bin Ma'in, and Ali bin Al-Madini. They have books and writings in this noble art which can be known by reviewing their biographies. Then came the likes of Imam Al-Bukhari Muhammad bin Isma'il, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Al-Darimi, and others. They added important bricks to this structure, derived new rules, and used the method of Consideration (Al-I'tibar), Comparison, Confrontation, Probing (Al-Sabr), and Selection in a broader way to know the men and distinguish error from correctness. Ahmad said in the biography of Sufyan bin 'Uyaynah: 'He is the most established of people in 'Amr bin Dinar' (2). He also said: 'I and Ali bin Al-Madini were discussing the most established person who narrates from",

    "text": "Al-Zuhri. Ali said: Sufyan bin 'Uyaynah. And I said: Malik bin Anas. I said: Malik makes fewer errors from Al-Zuhri, while Ibn 'Uyaynah errs in about twenty hadiths from Al-Zuhri, in such and such hadith. I mentioned eighteen hadiths of them, and I said: Bring what Malik erred in. He brought two or three hadiths. So I returned and looked into what Ibn 'Uyaynah erred in, and behold, they were more than twenty hadiths.' He also said: 'Malik has about three hundred hadiths from Al-Zuhri, and likewise Ibn 'Uyaynah has about three hundred from him' (1). So Imam Ahmad concluded from this comparison and probing that Malik is more established in Al-Zuhri than Ibn 'Uyaynah. Al-Nasa'i mentioned a narration by Abdul-Malik bin Nafi' Al-Shaybani from Ibn Umar: 'I saw a man come to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a cup containing Nabidh while he was at the Corner [of the Kaaba], and he gave the cup to him...' Then Al-Nasa'i said: 'Abdul-Malik bin Nafi' is not famous, and his hadith is not used as proof, and what is famous from Ibn Umar is contrary to his story.' Then he mentioned many narrations contradicting this narration and said: \"And these are the people of verification and justice, famous for the correctness of transmission, and Abdul-Malik does not stand in the place of one of them, even if a group of his likes supported him. And success is with Allah\" (2). It seems to me that this is the only method to know the trustworthy from others among the early narrators.

Even if his probity (justice) was not known, it appears they would suffice with concealing his condition and looking at his narrations. If he agreed with the known trustworthy narrators in his narrations, he was deemed trustworthy; and if he opposed them, he was deemed weak. Whoever looks at the speech of Ibn 'Adi in his discussion and Ibn Hibban in his *Du'afa* (Weak Narrators) will see that they used this method with very clear frequency. Ibn Hibban said in the biography of Abdullah bin Lahi'ah: 'I have probed his reports in the narration of the early ones and the later ones from him. I saw confusion present in the narration of the later ones from him, and much that has no basis in the narration of the early ones. So I returned to consideration (Al-I'tibar), and I saw him committing Tadlis (concealing the source) from weak people regarding people whom Ibn Lahi'ah saw as trustworthy, so he attached those fabricated matters to them' (1).

    "text": "the Authentic (*Sahih*), the Sick (*Saqim*), and Criticism and Praise (*Jarh wa Ta'dil*)... A Hadith is only deemed defective (*Yu'allal*) from perspectives where Criticism (*Jarh*) has no entry, for the hadith of a criticized narrator is fallen and flimsy. The defect (*'Illah*) of a Hadith frequently occurs in the hadiths of trustworthy narrators when they narrate a hadith that has a defect, so its knowledge is hidden from them, and the hadith becomes *Ma'lul*. The proof in this, for us, is memorization, understanding, and knowledge, nothing else\" (1). So the principle in applying the term *'Illah* is the hidden cause that impugns the authenticity of the Hadith. However, they may expand the usage and apply *'Illah* to every impugning cause, whether apparent or hidden. Indeed, hardly any book of *'Ilal* is devoid of its author including absolute causes of weakness in narration. Some even applied *'Illah* to a non-impugning cause as well, such as a hadith that a precise trustworthy narrator connected (*Wasalahu*) while others sent it (*Arsalahu*) (disconnected it) (2). Ibn Al-Salah said: \"The name *'Illah* may be applied to other than what we mentioned of the remaining causes impugning the Hadith, removing it from the state of authenticity to the state of weakness, preventing action upon it, which is the requirement of the word *'Illah* in its original sense. Therefore, we find in the books of *'Ilal* much criticism involving lying, negligence, poor memory, and similar types of criticism. Al-Tirmidhi called Abrogation (*Naskh*) a defect (*'Illah*) among the defects of Hadith. Furthermore, some of them applied the name *'Illah* to what is not impugning among the faces of difference, such as the sending (*Irsal*) by one who sent a Hadith that a precise trustworthy narrator connected (*Asnadahu*), to the point that he said: Among the sections of the Authentic (*Sahih*) is that which is Authentic Defective (*Sahih Ma'lul*), just as some of them said: Among the Authentic is the Authentic Odd (*Sahih Shadh*)\" (3).",

Ibn Al-Salah from the Muhaddithin also agreed with him, as he said: \"The people of Hadith call it *Al-Ma'lul*, and that is from them and from the jurists in their speech in the chapter of Analogy (*Qiyas*): the Cause (*'Illah*) and the Effect (*Ma'lul*); it is rejected by the people of language and Arabic\" (1). Al-Nawawi also considered it a grammatical error in his *Taqrib* (2). But we say: The usage of the word *Ma'lul* by the people of Hadith with the meaning they intended is not contrary to the language, because Abu Is-haq Al-Zajjaj, the famous linguist, used it in prosody (*'Arud*) close to the meaning used by the people of Hadith (3). Ibn Al-Qutiyyah the linguist (4) said: \"*'Alla al-insan* (the human became sick) is sickness, and the thing: a defect (*'illah*) befell it.\" Al-Jaza'iri mentioned this and then said: \"So its usage with the meaning they intended is not objectionable. Rather, some said: Using this term is more appropriate due to its occurrence in the expressions of the people of the art along with its validity in the language. And whoever preserves [knowledge] is a proof against whoever does not preserve\" (5).

And Allah knows best.\nThe Origin of the Science of 'Ilal Al-Hadith:\nIt seems that the science of 'Ilal Al-Hadith in a simplified, early form was parallel to the science of Hadith collection and criticism from the time of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them. Since illusion (*Wahm*) and error are among the most important elements of the defects of Hadith, and it is possible for some Companions to fall into them, we can exemplify this with incidents proven about the Companions where they corrected each other's illusions. The book *Al-Ijabah fima Istadrakathu Aisha 'ala Al-Sahabah* (The Response Concerning What Aisha Corrected of the Companions) by Al-Zarkashi is the largest collection of this. Just as Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib or some Companions corrected the illusion of Abdullah bin Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, in his statement: \"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, married Maymunah while he was in a state of Ihram\" (1). Then this science proceeded with narration and updating in every era; whenever narration expanded, its scope expanded and the need for it intensified. Allah destined for it in every era and land brilliant scholars who would sift the narrations and permeate them, extracting from them, letter by letter, the Authentic (*Sahih*), the Sick (*Saqim*), the Weak (*Da'if*), and the Defective (*Ma'lul*).\nImportance of the Science of 'Ilal Al-Hadith:\nSince it is known that defects of Hadith frequently occur in the hadiths of trustworthy narrators upon whom reliance is placed in narrations, so the general Muhaddithin and the commonality of them do not see a flaw in their hadiths. Therefore, it became the most obscure type of Hadith and the most precise in its path. No one undertakes it except he whom Allah has granted a deep understanding, comprehensive knowledge, awareness of the ranks of narrators, and piercing knowledge of the differences in narrations.",

As for the condition of the people who claim abundance of writing Hadith, or are fiqh scholars in the knowledge of Al-Shafi'i and Abu Hanifa, or followers of the speech of Al-Harith Al-Muhasibi, Al-Junayd, Dhul-Nun, and the people of spiritual thoughts, it is not for them to speak regarding anything of the science of Hadith unless they took it from its people and the people of knowledge. Only then can they speak with knowledge\" (1). Abdur-Rahman bin Mahdi said: \"Knowledge of Hadith is inspiration (*Ilham*). If you said to the scholar who finds defects in Hadith, 'From where did you say this?' he would not have a proof.\" Al-Hakim mentioned this. He also mentioned with his chain from Abu Zur'ah, and a man said to him: \"What is the proof for your finding defects in Hadith?\" He said: \"The proof is that you ask me about a hadith that has a defect, so I mention its defect. Then you go to Ibn Warah—meaning Muhammad bin Muslim bin Warah—and ask him about it, and do not inform him that you have asked me about it, so he mentions its defect. Then he goes to Abu Hatim and he finds the defect. Then distinguish the speech of each of us on that hadith. If you find a disagreement among us regarding its defect, then know that each of us spoke according to his intent. But if you find the word to be in agreement, then know the reality of this science.\" He said: \"So the man did so. And their word agreed upon it. So he said: 'I bear witness that this science is inspiration'\" (2).\nA Note Here: We should understand the speech of Abdur-Rahman bin Mahdi in its proper context, which is that his intent by saying \"Knowledge of Hadith is inspiration\" is not that he may find a defect without having a proof for it.

Then, if proof is requested from him, he must mention its details. It is not possible to find a defective hadith without a reason for it, but the one finding the defect may be brief in the ruling, mentioning his ruling without showing the reason. Some who have a desire to deny Hadith have used this saying of Ibn Mahdi as evidence, expanding its interpretation and deduction, saying: The Muhaddith may view a hadith agreed upon for its authenticity as weak and vice versa, without being able to establish proof for that, and he is excused in this judgment of his, like the money changer (*Sayrafi*) critic who judges dirhams as counterfeit or sound but is unable to explain the cause. We say: The matter is not as stated; reality contradicts his saying. Here are the books of *'Ilal* before us; if brevity and abbreviation are found in some, then in others you find detail, explanation of the cause, and the reasoning. His likeness is only that of a skilled doctor; if a person whose exterior appears healthy is presented to him, and the illness does not appear in him to the common people, he looks at him at first glance and expresses his opinion generally that he has such-and-such illness. Then if the examination, interpretation, analysis, and X-ray are performed on him, the truth of his saying appears clearly.

When I grew up, I removed them and gave them to her, and she sold them for about thirty dirhams. She used to send him to the Kuttab (Quran school). The signs of nobility, virtue, and righteousness were apparent in him from his childhood. Ibn Al-Jawzi narrated with his chain of narration from Abu Afif who said: Ahmad was in the Kuttab with us, and he was a young boy whose virtue we recognized. The Caliph was in Al-Raqqah, and people were writing to their homes, so they would send their women to the teacher saying: Send Ahmad bin Hanbal to us to write the answers to their letters for them. Perhaps they would dictate something objectionable to him, and he would not write it for them. Abu Siraj bin Khuzaymah said: When he entered upon them, he would not raise his head to look at them. My father said, mentioning him, and he began to marvel at his manners and his good way. He said: I spend on my children and bring them tutors so that they may be educated, but I do not see them succeeding, while this Ahmad bin Hanbal is an orphan boy; look at how he turned out. And he began to marvel. His Seeking of Knowledge and His Journey for It: Traveling to seek Hadith has a great significance. The early ones did not endure the hardships of alienation and travel except to collect knowledge from the scholars and Sheikhs who were scattered in the Islamic cities and capitals. The Imams of Hadith set magnificent examples in this regard that have no parallel in any other group or nation. This is a matter that needs no evidence or examples. Imam Ahmad began seeking Hadith from the Sheikhs of Baghdad. He says: The first one I wrote Hadith from was Abu Yusuf.",

Hushaym died when I was twenty years old, and my first hearing from Hushaym was in the year one hundred and ninety-nine (sic - likely 179). Then he traveled to Kufa, Basra, Mecca, Medina, Yemen, the Levant (Sham), and Al-Jazira, and he wrote from the scholars of every land. He narrated in the Musnad from eighty-two and some odd Sheikhs. He says: The first outing I made was to Basra in the year 186, which was the first; the second was in the year 190; and I entered for the third time in the year 194, and Ghundar had died; and I entered in the year 200. Salih said to his father: In which year did you go out to Sufyan bin Uyaynah? He said: In the year 187. We arrived at it, meaning Mecca, and Fudayl bin Iyad had died. It was the first year I performed Hajj. In the year ninety-one, Al-Walid bin Muslim performed Hajj. And in the year ninety-six. I stayed for the year ninety-seven and left in the year ninety-eight. I stayed in the year ninety-nine with Abd Al-Razzaq, and the news of the death of Sufyan, Yahya bin Sa'id, and Abd Al-Rahman bin Mahdi came to us in the year ninety-eight, meaning one hundred and ninety-eight. Abdullah bin Ahmad said: My father went out to Tus walking and went out to Yemen walking. My father said: We did not write anything from Abd Al-Razzaq from his memory except the first session; that was because we entered at night and found him sitting in a place, so he dictated seventy Hadiths to us. Then he turned to the people and said: Were it not for this one, I would not have narrated to you, meaning my father. Perhaps lack of means prevented him, and tight living conditions hindered him from journeys despite his intense desire for them. He said, may Allah have mercy on him: If I had fifty dirhams, I would have gone out to Jarir",

The Imam also went out to Abadan in the year eighty-six and went out to Wasit and stayed with Yazid bin Harun. Through these many journeys, he obtained a large treasure and a vast collection of Hadiths and traditions (Athar). Abdullah bin Ahmad said: Abu Zur'ah said to me: Your father memorized a thousand thousand (one million) Hadiths. It was said to him: How do you know? He said: I reviewed with him and covered the chapters. Al-Dhahabi mentioned it in Siyar A'lam Al-Nubala, then said: This is a true story regarding the breadth of Abu Abdullah's knowledge. They used to count in that the repeated ones, the traditions (Athar), the Fatwas of the Tabi'in, and what was interpreted; otherwise, the strong elevated (Marfu') texts do not reach a tenth of a tenth of that. Al-Dhahabi also mentioned from Abu Zur'ah that he said: I estimated Ahmad's books on the day he died, and they reached twelve loads and sacks. There was not on the back of a book among them 'Hadith of so-and-so' nor inside it 'So-and-so told us' except that he had memorized all of that by heart. The Imam encountered much suffering in his journey. The roads were not paved nor were the vehicles prepared. And even if they were, the emptiness of hand from dirhams prevented riding on mounts and vehicles. Furthermore, he was naturally disposed to self-esteem, so he would not accept a gift or a grant from anyone,",

Abu Nu'aym narrated in Al-Hilyah from Ishaq bin Rahwayh who said: When Ahmad bin Hanbal went out to Abd Al-Razzaq, his funds ran out, so he hired himself out to the camel drivers until he reached Sana'a. His companions had offered him financial help, but he did not accept anything from anyone. And with his chain of narration from Abd bin Humayd who said: I heard Abd Al-Razzaq say: Ahmad bin Hanbal came to us here and stayed for nearly two years. I said to him: O Abu Abdullah, take this thing and benefit from it, for our land is not a land of trade or earning. Abd Al-Razzaq showed us his palm and extended it with dinars in it. Ahmad said: I am well. And he did not accept from me. It was narrated from Ahmad bin Sulayman Al-Wasiti that he said: It reached me that Ahmad bin Hanbal pawned his bucket (or shoes) at a baker's for food he took from him when he left Yemen, and he hired himself out to some people, camel drivers, when he left Yemen. Abd Al-Razzaq offered him a good amount of dirhams, but he did not accept them from him. It was also narrated from Ali bin Al-Jahm bin Badr who said: We had a neighbor who brought out a book to us and said: Do you recognize this handwriting? We said: Yes, this is the handwriting of Ahmad bin Hanbal. So we said to him: How did he write that? He said: We were in Mecca staying with Sufyan bin Uyaynah. We sought Ahmad bin Hanbal for days but did not see him. Then we came to him to ask about him. The people of the house he was in said: He is in that room. We came to him, and the door was closed on him, and he was wearing old worn-out clothes. We said to him: O Abu Abdullah, what is your news? We haven't seen you for days. He said: My clothes were stolen. I said to him: I have dinars,",

So I brought out a dinar, but he refused to take it and said: Buy me a garment and cut it into two halves. He signaled that he would use one half as a lower garment (Izar) and wear the other half as an upper garment (Rida'). He said: And bring me the remainder. So I did, and I came with paper and a writing notebook, so he wrote for me; so this is his handwriting. Ibn Al-Jawzi mentioned from Salih that he heard his father say: I went out to Kufa and I used to sleep with a mud brick under my head. I got a fever, so I returned to my mother, and I had not asked her permission. With this proud soul, and with the toil of life and the hardship of living, relying on Allah, he went out in His path traversing the wilderness and wasteland, spreading the bare earth beneath him and wearing the sky as a blanket, using mud bricks and stones as pillows, meeting Sheikhs and receiving Hadith from them, until he became an Imam who is followed, a proof pointed at with fingertips, and to whom journeys are made for taking and hearing. His Taking the Position for Narrating and Fatwa: It was the custom of most Muhaddithin (Hadith scholars), may Allah have mercy on them, that one of them would not sit (to teach) except after the attainment of thought, maturity of opinion, and completion of mental strength. Ibn Khallad Al-Ramahurmuzi said in Al-Muhaddith Al-Fasil, and from him Al-Khatib in Al-Jami' li Akhlaq Al-Rawi wa Adab Al-Sami': 'What is correct in my view by way of tradition and consideration regarding the limit which, when the transmitter reaches it, it is proper for him to narrate, is that he completes fifty, because it is the end of middle age, and in it is the gathering of tradition... And it is not disapproved that he narrates upon completing forty, because it is the limit of maturity and the peak of perfection. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was made a Prophet when he was forty",

    "text": "years old. And at forty, a person's determination and strength reach their limit, his intellect becomes abundant, and his opinion becomes excellent.' End quote. It seems that Imam Ahmad did not take the position for narrating and Fatwa until after forty. Before that, he was devoted to seeking, taking, and collecting, busy with many journeys to meet Sheikhs. Ibn Al-Jawzi mentioned from Al-Hajjaj bin Al-Sha'ir that he came to Ahmad bin Hanbal and asked him to narrate to him in the year 203 (meaning his age was 39 years then), but he refused to narrate to him. So he went out to Abd Al-Razzaq, then returned in the year four, meaning two hundred and four. Ahmad had narrated, and people had settled around him, and on this day he was forty years old. The Praise of the Imams for Him: When he sat for narrating, the livers of camels were struck (journeys were made) to him, and saddles were tightened towards him from every direction to drink from his abundant spring. His reputation spread in the vast Islamic regions, and his knowledge and virtue became apparent to people among his brothers and companions, until his Sheikhs acknowledged his virtue and praised him with praise that this ascetic, striving, worshipping, jurist Imam deserved. Al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, said: I saw in Baghdad three wonders: I saw a Nabataean who leans towards me (engages with me) until it is as if he is an Arab (or: so eloquent he seems Arab), and it is as if he is a Nabataean; and I saw a Bedouin making grammatical errors until it is as if he is a Nabataean; and I saw a young man whose hair has been streaked with grey, if he says: 'Whatever told us,' all the people say: 'He spoke the truth.' Al-Muzani said: So I asked him, and he said: The first is Al-Za'farani, the second is Abu Thawr Al-Kalbi—and he used to make errors—and as for the young man, he is Ahmad bin Hanbal.",

Ali bin Al-Madini said: 'Ahmad bin Hanbal is our Sayyid (Master).' He used to revere and honor him greatly, and he is who he is in the science of Hadith, to the extent that Al-Bukhari said about him: 'I did not belittle myself except before Ali bin Al-Madini.' Ibn Al-Madini also used to say: 'My master Ahmad bin Hanbal commanded me not to narrate except from a book.' He also said: 'Ahmad bin Hanbal is, in my view, superior to Sa'id bin Jubayr in his time, because Sa'id had equals, while this one has no equal.' He used to say: 'There is no one among our companions who has memorized more than Abu Abdullah Ahmad bin Hanbal, and it has reached me that he does not narrate except from a book, and we have a model in him.'

That does not turn him away from his religion. Were it not for Ahmad bin Hanbal undertaking this matter, it would have been a disgrace upon us until the Day of Resurrection.' He also said: 'There was not in the era of Ahmad bin Hanbal the likes of these four: Ali bin Al-Madini, Yahya bin Ma'in, Ahmad bin Hanbal, and Ishaq bin Rahwayh. The most knowledgeable of these four in Hadith and its defects was Ali bin Al-Madini. The most knowledgeable of them in Men (narrators) and the one with the most Hadith was Yahya bin Ma'in. The best memorizer of them for Hadith and Fiqh was Ishaq bin Rahwayh. However, Ahmad bin Hanbal was, in my view, more knowledgeable about the defects of Hadith than Ishaq, and Ahmad combined knowledge of Hadith, Fiqh, piety, asceticism, and patience.' Abu Zur'ah was asked about Ali bin Al-Madini and Yahya bin Ma'in: Which of them was a better memorizer? He said: 'Ali was more continuous and precise, and Yahya had more understanding of the authentic Hadith and the sickly one. The most comprehensive of them was Abu Abdullah Ahmad bin Hanbal; he was a man of memorization, a man of Fiqh, and a man of knowledge.' He said: 'I do not know anyone among our companions more knowledgeable in Fiqh than Ahmad.' It was said to him: 'Is the choice of Ahmad and Ishaq more beloved to you or the saying of Al-Shafi'i?' He said: 'Rather, the choice of Ahmad and Ishaq is more beloved to me.' He said: 'My eyes have not seen the likes of Ahmad bin Hanbal in knowledge, asceticism, Fiqh, recognition, and every good.'

I have also authored a separate work on his virtues. * The Distinction of Imam Ahmad Among His Peers: The one who looks into the personality of the Imam will see a virtuous distinction and a distinctive virtue among his peers and contemporaries. It is that he combined reception, narrating, narration (Riwayah), understanding (Dirayah), speech on the defects of Hadith and knowledge of Men, and speech on Fiqh and issues (Masa'il). Allah has immortalized all these traces from him, so he rightfully became an Imam who is followed, whereas we find among his peers those who combined different sciences, but Allah did not decree that these different sciences be transmitted from them. So we find him having dedicated himself to a side without being free for the other sides. Look at the biography of Yahya bin Ma'in, the companion of Imam Ahmad's life, and you will find the confirmation of that. Ahmad bin Uqbah says: I asked Yahya bin Ma'in: How much Hadith have you written, O Abu Zakariya? He said: I wrote with this hand of mine six hundred thousand Hadiths. Ahmad bin Uqbah said: And I think that the Muhaddithin wrote for him with their hands six hundred thousand and six hundred thousand (1). Muhammad bin Nasr Al-Tabari said: I heard Yahya bin Ma'in say: I have written with my hand a thousand thousand (one million) Hadiths (2).",

Imam Ahmad said about him: 'Every Hadith that Yahya bin Ma'in does not know is not a Hadith.' And in a narration: 'Is not established.' Ali bin Al-Madini said: 'We do not know anyone since Adam (!) who wrote of Hadith what Yahya bin Ma'in wrote' (2). Despite this large treasure he had in Hadith, he did little in terms of narration and speaking (teaching), and he did not hold the circles known among his peers of Muhaddithin for dictation and narration. It appears that he dedicated himself to a special type of Hadith science, which is the criticism of narrations and Jarh wa Ta'dil (Disparagement and Praise). Thus, we find a large collection from him in this aspect, just as we find many quotations from him in the books of Men (Rijal). What supports this is that Abu Dawud, who is one of the narrators who recorded the material of criticism from him and accompanied him, did not extract (include) in the book Al-Sunan from him except twenty-five Hadiths only, despite the breadth of his book and his inclusion of a large amount of Hadiths of rulings. Whereas his book is full of narration from Ahmad, Musaddad, and others who are like him or below him in collecting narrations (3). Likewise, Imam Al-Ijli, Abu Al-Hasan Ahmad bin Abdullah bin Salih (182 - 261), was one of great reception and great memory. He took from most of the Imams of his era",

Even Al-Duri exaggerated regarding him with a rare exaggeration and said: He is counted among the likes of Ahmad bin Hanbal and Yahya bin Ma'in. Yet, with that, we hardly find a narration for him in the known books of Hadith, to the extent that Al-Dhahabi said: 'I do not think he narrated anything other than stories' (1). Description of Imam Ahmad and His Appearance: Al-Khatib narrated with his chain of narration from Muhammad bin Al-Abbas bin Al-Walid Al-Nahwi who said: I saw Ahmad bin Hanbal as a man of handsome face, of medium build among men, dyeing with henna a dye that was not intense red, with black hairs in his beard. I saw his clothes were coarse but white. And I saw him turbaned with his Izar (lower garment) upon him. Ibn Al-Jawzi and others mentioned from Ibn Ja'far bin Dharih Al-Ukbari: I sought Ahmad bin Hanbal to ask him about an issue. I greeted him, and he was an old man, dyed, tall, dark-skinned, intensely dark. Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned from Abd Al-Malik Al-Maymuni saying: I do not know that I saw anyone with cleaner clothes, nor more attentive to himself regarding his mustache, the hair of his head, and the hair of his body, nor with purer clothes and intense whiteness than Ahmad bin Hanbal.

His Clothing: Al-Maymuni said: Ahmad bin Hanbal's clothes, between the two garments, his wrap (Milhafah) was worth fifteen dirhams. It was a garment bought for a dinar or so; it did not have objectionable thinness nor objectionable coarseness, and his wrap was fringed. Al-Fadl bin Ziyad said: I saw Abu Abdullah in the winter wearing two shirts and a colored Jubbah (outer robe) between them, and perhaps he wore a shirt and a heavy fur coat. Perhaps I saw him in the severe cold wearing the fur over the Jubbah. And I saw him wearing a turban over the cap (Qalansuwah) and a heavy cloak (Kisa').

He gave me a boot (Khuff) of his to repair which he had worn for seventeen years; there were five or six places of stitching in it from patching. Such was his clothing and his footwear, may Allah have mercy on him. If we compare this state with his livelihood and means of sustenance, we do not find it unlikely. For he, may Allah have mercy on him, was an ascetic among the great ascetics in the world, content with the little sufficiency that came to him from the yield of his land and what came from the earning of his hand and his family, refraining from accepting prizes and gifts. His Asceticism and Chastity: Ahmad's asceticism is a well-known thing. We have seen the pattern of his living, his night and his day, how he lived as an ascetic far from luxury and ease. We believe that had he wanted the world, it would have come to him dragging its trails with positions and mandates. His grandfather had a prominent status, and his father was likewise in the service of the Abbasid Islamic State. Then he had reached the summit in knowledge, virtue, and leadership. He had followers among the commanders and the common people who would ransom him with their souls, let alone their wealth, and who saw it as an honor for them that he accept gifts from them. But the Imam did not cast his eye toward the world and its adornments. He did not accept mandates and positions, preferring obscurity for himself and choosing humility and contentment with what would cover his need at the lowest levels of living.

I have chosen you, so prepare yourself so that I may take you in to the Commander of the Faithful to appoint you to the judiciary of Yemen.' Ahmad turned to him and said: 'I only came to you to acquire knowledge from you, yet you order me to enter into the judiciary for them?' He rebuked him, so Al-Shafi'i felt shy. Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Salih bin Ahmad who said: I entered upon my father, may Allah have mercy on him, one day during the days of Al-Wathiq—and Allah knows best in what state we were. He had gone out for the Asr prayer. He had a felt mat he used to sit on, upon which many years had passed until it was worn out. Underneath it was a paper, and in it was: 'It has reached me, O Abu Abdullah, what straitened circumstances you are in and what debt is upon you. I have directed four thousand dirhams to you at the hands of so-and-so for you to pay your debt and expand upon your family. It is not from charity or Zakat; rather, it is something I inherited from my father.' I read the letter and put it down. When I entered (or he entered), I said: 'O father, what is this letter?'

As for the debt, it is to a man who does not harass us. As for our family, they are in a blessing, and praise be to Allah.' I went with the letter to the man who had delivered the man's letter. After a while, a letter from the man came to him with the same message, so he returned the answer just as he had responded (before). When a year or less or more had passed, we mentioned it.

Ahmad said to the messenger of Muhammad Al-Sarakhsi: 'May Allah reward him with good; we are in a state of sufficiency and abundance,' and he refused to take it. He urged him again, but he said: 'Let us remain dignified.'\n\nImam Ahmad's Livelihood:\nIndeed, seeking knowledge and Fiqh was almost synonymous with poverty. To the extent that a person directs his concern and ambition towards seeking and acquiring knowledge, his share of the world decreases, unless he has a source of income other than personal earning. If natural asceticism and extreme contentment are added to that, then do not ask about the tightness of his livelihood. The ideal student of this Ummah and the Faqih of the Companions, Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrates to us about his condition during his seeking of knowledge, and then his poverty and need, in what Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih in the Book of Knowledge. He said with his chain of narration: Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'People say: Abu Hurairah narrates too much. Were it not for two verses in the Book of Allah, I would not have narrated a single Hadith.' Then he recited: \"Indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs...\" to His saying \"the Merciful.\" 'Indeed, our brothers from the Muhajirun were occupied by striking deals in the markets, and our brothers from the Ansar were occupied by working on their properties. But Abu Hurairah used to stick to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for the filling of his stomach, attending what they did not attend and memorizing what they did not memorize.' Imam Ahmad was among those sincere in seeking and acquiring knowledge, and he did not devote himself to trade or a specific continuous job. Rather, he was content with the little that came to him from the rent of a house he owned and from his work with his own hand or the hand of his family. Ibn Al-Jawzi mentioned in *Al-Manaqib*:",

    "text": "Ahmad, may Allah be pleased with him, had a father who left him *Tiraz* (meaning shops for weaving, where clothes are woven) and a house he lived in. He used to rent out those shops and, through their rent, abstained from asking people. It seems he used to rent out part of the house as well. However, the rent of these shops and the house was not sufficient to cover his needs. As is apparent from what Muhammad bin Yunus Al-Baladi mentioned, he said: 'I was sitting with Abu Abdullah when one of his tenants came to him with a dirham and a half. When it fell into his hand, he left me and got up and entered his home, and I saw happiness on his face. I thought he had prepared it for an important need.' Since this yield was not sufficient for his expenditure, he used to go out for *Luqat* (gleaning leftover harvest). Abu Ja'far Al-Tarsusi said: The one with whom Abu Abdullah stayed told me, saying: 'When he stayed with me, he went out for *Luqat*. He came back having gleaned something small. I said to him: \"You have eaten more than you have gleaned.\" He said: \"I saw a matter I was shy of; I saw them gleaning, and a man would stand on all fours, and I was thinner when I gleaned.\"' Abu Bakr Al-Marwadhi said: Abu Abdullah said to me: 'I went out to the *Thaghr* (frontier) on foot, and we gleaned. I saw people spoiling people's farms; it is not befitting for anyone to enter a man's farm except with his permission.' Ishaq bin Rahwayh said: 'I and Ahmad were in Yemen with Abdul-Razzaq. I was above in the room, and he was below. Whenever I came to a place, I bought a slave girl.' He said: 'I learned that his funds had run out, so I offered him [money]. He refused. I said: \"If you wish, as a loan, and if you wish, as a gift.\" He refused. I looked, and behold, he was weaving *Tikk* (waistbands/drawstrings), selling them, and spending [from that].' It has been mentioned previously that he was in need during some of his days, so he hired himself out to porters. Perhaps he was in need and poverty overwhelmed him, so he would copy books for people for a wage. It has previously been mentioned",

We sought Ahmad bin Hanbal for days but did not see him. Then we went to him to ask about him. The people of the house he was in said to us: 'He is in that room.' We came to him, and the door was closed on him, and he had worn-out clothes on. We said to him: 'O Abu Abdullah, what is your news? We haven't seen you for days.' He said: 'My clothes were stolen.' I said to him: 'I have dinars; if you wish, take them as a loan, and if you wish, as a gift.' He refused to do so. I said: 'Will you write for me for it?' (Thus in the book, and it seems the correct reading is: 'for a wage'). He said: 'Yes.' So I brought out a dinar, but he refused to take it. He said: 'Buy a garment/fabric for me and cut it in two halves.' He gestured that he would wrap his lower body with one half and drape the other half over his upper body. He said: 'And bring me the remainder of it.' So I did, and I brought paper and a notebook, and he wrote for me. So this is his handwriting.\"' There was another weak source for Imam Ahmad's livelihood at times, which used to provide sustenance for him and his family. His wife, Umm Salih, used to spin [yarn] in the house. Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Salih bin Ahmad who said: My father said: 'Your mother used to spin fine yarn during times of high prices, and she would sell the skeins for two dirhams, less or more, and that was our sustenance.' This limited income, which was also unstable, depicts for us the standard of living of the Imam and his family in food and clothing. We have seen in his description and appearance how his clothing was. As for food, Salih, the son of the Imam, narrated to us in what was narrated from him",

I never saw my father buy a pomegranate, nor a quince, nor any fruit, unless he bought a melon, which he would eat with bread, or grapes or dates. As for other than that, I never saw him buy it.' He also said: 'Often bread would be baked for him, and he would put lentils, fat, and a few dates in an earthenware pot for two months. He would come to the children with a bowl, call out to some of them, and give it to them; they would laugh and eat. He frequently used vinegar as a condiment. The Imam once felt a chill in his extremities, and he said: 'I see this only from my condiment, eating vinegar and salt.'' Imam Ahmad's Generosity and Munificence Despite Poverty: Ibn Al-Jawzi narrated in *Al-Manaqib* from Abu Bakr Al-Marwadhi who said: 'Abu Abdullah would often share his own sustenance. Abu Sa'id Al-Darir (the Blind) came and complained [of need]. He said to him: \"O Abu Sa'id, we have nothing but this beam.\" So a porter was brought to carry it. He said: \"I took the beam and sold it for nine dirhams and two Daniqs.\"' And from Yahya bin Hilal Al-Warraq who said: 'I came to Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Numayr and complained to him. He brought out four dirhams or five dirhams to me and said: \"This is half of what I own.\"' He said: 'And I came once to Abu Abdullah Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal, and he brought out four dirhams to me and said: \"This is all that I own.\"' And from Harun Al-Mustamli who said: 'I met Ahmad and said: \"We have nothing.\"",

Al-Marwadhi said: 'I was with Abu Abdullah on the road to Al-Askar. We stopped at a resting place. I brought out a loaf of bread and placed a jug of water before him. Suddenly, a dog came. It stood opposite him and began wagging its tail. He threw a morsel to it, and it began to eat. He kept throwing morsels to it. I feared it would harm his [own] sustenance, so I got up and shouted at it to drive it away from him. I looked at Abu Abdullah, and he had turned red and changed out of shyness, and he said: \"Leave it, for Ibn Abbas said: 'It has a soul/craving [that is bad to deny].'\"' Imam Ahmad's Family: Imam Ahmad did not marry until after he reached forty years of age, as narrated by Al-Marwadhi. His first wife was 'Abbasah bint Al-Fadl, Umm Salih; no one was born from her except his son Salih. Then he married Rayhanah, who is Umm Abdullah, and no one was born from her except him [Abdullah]. She was a righteous woman who saw happiness in her husband's pleasure. When she passed seven days [after marriage], she said to the Imam: 'How did you see [things], O cousin? Did you disapprove of anything?' He said: 'No, except that this sandal of yours squeaks.' In another narration, Ahmad's wife said to Ahmad days after she entered upon him: 'Do you disapprove of anything from me?' He said: 'No, except for this sandal which you wear; it was not present during the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said: 'So she sold it and bought a cut [shoe].' She was Umm Abdullah.",

Then Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn were born as twins, and they died shortly after their birth. Then she bore Al-Hasan and Muhammad, and they lived until they reached about the age of forty. Then she bore Sa'id after them.' Ibn Al-Jawzi mentioned the two mentioned wives, Umm Salih and Umm Abdullah, and this slave girl, then said: 'We do not know that Ahmad, may Allah be pleased with him, married other than the two women we mentioned, nor did he take a concubine except this slave girl whose name was Husn. However, Ibn Al-Munadi mentioned in the book *Fada'il Ahmad* (Virtues of Ahmad) that Ahmad asked his family's permission to take a concubine seeking to follow [the Sunnah], so they permitted him. He bought a slave girl for a small price and named her Rayhanah, following the practice of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. According to this, he would have bought two slave girls, and one of them would have been during the life of his wife.' Al-Dhahabi weakened this statement of Ibn Al-Munadi in his *Tarikh*.

A blind, reckless Fitnah whose poisonous winds blew during the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Ma'mun. Although its germs were ancient and its roots deep, its links connect to Jewish hatred and resentment against Islam and Muslims. This Fitnah was fed by Greek and Roman philosophy, which was translated with all its malice, filth, polytheism, and paganism. Had the translation been limited to medicine and other human sciences, and had Muslims benefited from them in their worldly affairs, it would have been a praiseworthy matter, for our religion is a religion of Fitrah (natural disposition) that commands us not to forget our share of the world. But history tells us that the translation included, or rather encompassed, false philosophical ideas related to creed and the Essence of the Creator, Mighty and Majestic, and His Attributes as well—matters for which Muslims had no need, as our Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had explained them with the clearest explanation. The first generation of this Ummah understood them clearly without interpretation (*Ta'wil*), distortion (*Tahrif*), likening (*Tamthil*), conditioning (*Takyif*), or negation (*Ta'til*); they passed them on as they appeared.

The last of this nation will not be rectified except by what rectified its first. When corrupt ideas entered them, they caused among them the denial of Attributes partially or totally, or their interpretation, or negation, along with other doubts and suspicions. Just as Jahmism, Mu'tazilism, and Ash'arism occurred as creeds. In summary, the origin of this malicious doctrine is the influence of Judaism fed by disbelieving philosophy and sophistry. Its roots connect to the Jews who were in the era of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and used to speak of the creation of the Torah. Ibn Al-Athir said in his *Tarikh* in the events of the year 240: 'In it, Judge Abu Abdullah Ahmad bin Du'ad died in Muharram, twenty days after his son Abu Al-Walid. He was a caller to the statement of the creation of the Quran and other doctrines of the Mu'tazilah. He took that from Bishr Al-Marisi, and Bishr took it from Al-Jahm bin Safwan, and Jahm took it from Al-Ja'd bin Dirham, and Al-Ja'd took it from Aban bin Sam'an, and Aban took it from Talut, the nephew of Labid bin Al-A'sam and his son-in-law. And Talut took it from Labid bin Al-A'sam the Jew who bewitched the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Labid used to speak of the creation of the Torah. The first to write on that was Talut, and he was a Zindiq (heretic), so he spread Zandaqah (heresy) (1).' The men of this deviant chain are Jews or of Jewish origin. As for Bishr bin Ghiyath Al-Marisi, who took charge of this Fitnah in his time and was the eye of the Jahmiyyah, their head, and their scholar in his era, his father was a Jew.",

A Jew passed by, and I heard him say: \"He will not corrupt your Book for you as his father corrupted the Torah for us\"—meaning that his father was a Jew (1).' Al-'Ijli said in his *Thiqat*: 'Bishr Al-Marisi, upon him be the curse of Allah once; a short shaykh, ugly in appearance, with dirty clothes, abundant hair, looking most like a Jew. His father was a Jew, a dyer in Kufa in the market of nursing mothers.' Then he said: \"May Allah not have mercy on him, for he was a Fasiq (transgressor)\" (2). Al-Marwadhi said: 'I heard Abu Abdullah mention Al-Marisi and say: \"His father was a Jew; what thing do you see him becoming?\" (3).' The summary of the Fitnah and the Ordeal is that Al-Ma'mun, the Abbasid Caliph, had been overtaken by a group of Mu'tazilah who deviated him from the path of truth and beautified for him the statement of the creation of the Quran and the negation of Attributes from Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. Al-Bayhaqi said: 'There was no Caliph before him among the Umayyads or Abbasids except that he was on the Madhhab of the Salaf, and among them [the deviants] was Jahm. When he [Ma'mun] assumed the Caliphate, these people met with him and incited him to that and beautified it for him. It happened that he went out to Tarsus to fight the Romans, so he wrote to his deputy in Baghdad, Ishaq bin Ibrahim bin Mus'ab, the chief of police, ordering him to call the people to the statement of the creation of the Quran.

They refused, so he threatened them with beating and cutting off their livelihoods, so most of them answered under coercion. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal and Muhammad bin Nuh continued to refuse, so they were carried on a camel in a single litter, shackled between two balanced loads. When they were in the land of Al-Rahbah, a man from the Bedouins among their worshippers came to them. He was called Jabir bin Umar. He greeted the Imam and said to him: 'O you, indeed you are the delegate of the people, so do not be a bad omen for them. You are the head of the people today, so beware of answering them to what they call you to, lest they [the people] answer, and you bear their burdens on the Day of Resurrection. If you love Allah, then be patient with what you are in, for there is nothing between you and Paradise except to be killed. And if you are not killed, you will die anyway; if you live, you live praiseworthily.' The Imam said: 'His words were among what strengthened my resolve on what I was in of refusal.' When they approached the army of the Caliphate and camped a stage away from it, a servant came wiping his tears with the edge of his garment saying: 'It grieves me, O Abu Abdullah, that Al-Ma'mun has drawn a sword he has never drawn before, and he swears by his kinship to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace: If you do not answer him to the statement of the creation of the Quran, he will surely kill you with that sword.' He said: So Imam Ahmad fell to his knees and looked towards the sky and said: 'My Master, Your forbearance has deluded this sinner until he dared against Your Awliya (allies) with beating and killing. O Allah, if Your Speech is uncreated, then suffice us against his burden.' He said: Then the scream came to them announcing the death of Al-Ma'mun in the last third of the night.

He prayed with the people of the prison while chains were on his legs. Then he was brought out for beating before Al-Mu'tasim. When he was brought in to Al-Mu'tasim, they increased the shackles on him. The Imam said: 'I could not walk with them, so I tied them with my waistband (*Tikkah*) and carried them by hand.

When the beating stopped, my mind would return to me. Al-Mu'tasim stood up to me calling me to their saying, but I did not answer him. They started saying: \"Woe to you! The Caliph is at your head.\" But I did not accept. They resumed the beating, then he returned to me, but I did not answer him. They resumed the beating, then he came to me a third time and called me, but I did not comprehend what he said due to the severity of the beating. Then they resumed the beating, and my mind went; I did not feel the beating. That terrified him regarding my condition. He ordered me, and I was released. I did not realize until I was in a room of a house, and the shackles had been released from my legs. That was on the twentieth day of Ramadan of the year two hundred and twenty-one. The total of what he was whipped was some thirty odd lashes, and it was said: eighty lashes, but",

Ashabadh, one of the executioners, says: 'I struck Ahmad bin Hanbal eighty lashes; if I had struck an elephant with them, I would have demolished it' (2).

When (Al-Mu'tasim) brought Ahmad and ordered the executioners, they suspended him between the sky and the earth. Sixty executioners stood for him, thirty on one side and thirty on one side... Al-Mu'tasim stood up to him and said: \"Woe to you, O Ahmad! I ask Allah not to test me with you. What do you say regarding the Quran?\" He said: \"The Quran is the Speech of Allah, and the Speech of Allah is uncreated.\" So he ordered regarding him, and he was beaten. Then he asked him, and he repeated his first saying: \"The Speech of Allah.\" So he ordered, and they repeated the beating on him. Then he stood up to him and implored him by Allah for his own sake. He ordered two cushions (4), and they were placed under his feet, so he was suspended between the sky and the earth. Then Al-Mu'tasim asked him about the Quran, and he said to him: \"The Speech of Allah, and the Speech of Allah is uncreated.\" One of the executioners said to him: \"O Commander of the Faithful, if you wish, I will strike him two lashes that will kill him.\" So he struck him two lashes that split his sides, and his intestines spilled out. So he ordered regarding him, and he was taken out of the iron and wrapped in a full garment. The people and the commoners shouted, and the executioners came out and said: \"Ahmad has died.\" They mentioned to the commoners that they had taken the iron off his legs while he was on his face. Then Abu Is-haq, the enemy of Allah, came out of the palace, and Ibn Abi Du'ad, the Zindiq, in a great procession. The commoners stood between Abu Is-haq and the bridge until he feared for himself, and they let him hear what distressed him (5).'",

    "text": "When the Imam was carried from the House of the Caliphate to the house of Ishaq bin Ibrahim while he was fasting, they brought him *Sawiq* (barley mush) to break his fast due to weakness, but he refused that and completed his fast. When the Zuhr prayer arrived, he prayed with them while blood was on his garment. Ibn Sama'ah the Judge said to him: 'You prayed in your blood?' Ahmad said to him: 'Umar prayed while his wound gushed blood.' So he remained silent. I say: Indeed, the prayer that the Imam prayed in his blood is better, Allah willing, with Allah by thousands of degrees than their prayers with their complete apparent purifications, because their prayers were tainted with innovations and corruption of creed. As for the prayer of the Imam, it was pure from any impurity, adorned by the noble badge of wounds for Allah and in the path of Allah. This noble blood that flowed from him for the sake of Allah will come on the Day of Resurrection, Allah willing; the color is the color of blood and the scent is the scent of musk, by which Allah raises his ranks with Him. When the Imam returned to the house of Ishaq bin Ibrahim, the chief of police, a surgeon came to him and cut dead flesh from his body and began treating him. The deputy would ask about him all the time because Al-Mu'tasim regretted what he had done to Ahmad greatly and kept asking the deputy about him. The deputy would inquire about his news. When he recovered, Al-Mu'tasim and the Muslims rejoiced at that. When the Imam went after his recovery to his home, he remained like that for the duration of Al-Mu'tasim's Caliphate, and likewise in the days of his son Al-Wathiq. When Al-Mutawakkil 'Ala Allah assumed the Caliphate, people rejoiced at his Caliphate, for he was a lover of the Sunnah and its people. He lifted the Inquisition from the people and wrote to the horizons: 'Let no one speak of the statement of the creation of the Quran.' He honored the Imam with extreme honor, to the point that he wrote to his deputy in Baghdad to bring the Imam to him. The Imam excused himself, then he [the Caliph] insisted on him, as he wished to be comforted by his proximity and looking at him and obtaining blessing from his supplication. So the Imam traveled to him while he was ailing regarding some of his sons. He lodged him in a noble lodging in",

Abu Abdullah refused the Caliph, so the Caliph said: 'It must be so, and this is only for your son.' So Abu Abdullah withheld from refusing. Then he began to blame his family and his uncle. After days, the Imam departed and entered Baghdad secretly. The Caliph used to send for him regarding matters to consult him and seek his advice in things that occurred to him (1). When the ordeal was lifted from him and Allah replaced it with the recognition of his virtue by the elite and the commoners—indeed, even the Caliph listened to his counsel and guidance—and Allah empowered the Imam over his enemies who caused him harm, did he take revenge on anyone? No, never. It is not hoped from a man whom Allah has stamped with forbearance, asceticism, and seeking reward with Allah that he would seek revenge from anyone. When Al-Mutawakkil summoned him and he approached the camp, Wasif the Servant met him in a great procession. He greeted the Imam, and the Imam returned the greeting. Wasif said to him: 'Allah has empowered you over your enemy Ibn Abi Du'ad.' He did not return an answer to him. We do not find a mention that the Imam took revenge on him or ever desired that. Likewise, he absolved everyone who harmed him except the people of innovation. regarding that, he used to recite His saying, the Exalted: \"And let them pardon and overlook\" [the verse], and say: 'What benefits you that your Muslim brother is punished because of you?' And the Exalted said: \"But whoever pardons and makes reconciliation - his reward is [due] from Allah. Indeed, He does not like wrongdoers.\" Hanbal said: I heard him say: 'Everyone who mentioned me is absolved except an innovator. And I have absolved Abu Is-haq—meaning Al-Mu'tasim.'",

I said: \"I did not leave his house until I absolved him, and I remembered the saying of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace: 'No one will stand on the Day of Resurrection except one who pardoned,' so I pardoned him.\"' Nothing is expected from the Imam of the Sunnah except this noble stance. He did not harbor a grudge against anyone for himself, while his followers wanted to incite him in some days, but he did not deviate from the upright path by a hair's breadth. Hanbal bin Is-haq, the cousin of the Imam, said in the *Book of Al-Mihnah*: 'When Al-Wathiq manifested this doctrine, beat [people] for it, and imprisoned [them], a group of the jurists of Baghdad came to Abu Abdullah, among them Bakr bin Abdullah, Ibrahim bin Ali Al-Munajji, Fadl bin Asim, and others. They came to Abu Abdullah, so I entered upon him and asked permission for them. They entered upon him and said to him: \"O Abu Abdullah, this matter has spread and worsened. This man does such and such, and he has manifested what he has manifested. We fear for him more than this.\" They mentioned to him that Ibn Abi Du'ad resolved to order the teachers to teach the boys in the Maktab (school) along with the Quran, the Quran is such and such [created]. Abu Abdullah said to them: \"So what do you want?\" They said: \"We came to consult you regarding what we want.\" He said: \"So what do you want?\" They said: \"That we are not pleased with his command nor his authority.\" Abu Abdullah debated them for an hour until he said to them: \"So what harms them if this matter is not completed? Have you not gone from that to what is disliked? You must [deny] with your hearts, and do not withdraw a hand from obedience, and do not split the staff of the Muslims along with you, and do not shed your blood and the blood of the Muslims. Look into the outcome of your affair, and do not hasten. Be patient until the righteous rests or the wicked is rested from.\" Much speech circulated among them regarding that which I did not memorize. Abu Abdullah argued against them for this [stance].",

Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, is the Helper of His religion, and indeed this affair has a Lord who will help it. Indeed, Islam is mighty and impregnable.' So they left Abu Abdullah and he did not answer them to anything of what they resolved upon (1). The ordeal of Imam Ahmad and his emergence from it patient and seeking reward after this severe harm was a matter by which Allah honored and ennobled this Imam and singled him out apart from his peers. Allah made it a remaining word in his progeny. Their word united in praising him for this majestic stance, and his personality emerged as a banner and a sign for the Sunnah and its people. Imam Al-Bukhari said: 'When Ahmad bin Hanbal was beaten, we were in Basra. I heard Abu Al-Walid Al-Tayalisi say: \"If Ahmad were among the Children of Israel, he would have been a legend (*Uhdu'thah*).\"' Al-Muzani said: 'Ahmad bin Hanbal on the Day of the Ordeal, Abu Bakr on the Day of Apostasy (*Riddah*), Umar on the Day of the Saqifah, Uthman on the Day of the House (*Al-Dar*), and Ali on the Day of the Camel and Siffin.'

The Ordeal with whose fire the people of Hadith were burned, led by Imam Ahmad, was replaced by a gift from Allah, the Exalted. Instead of being in humiliation and testing at one time, the time came when the word was theirs, and they were honored with extreme honor. The star of the Mu'tazilah, who had previously taken over the authority and used force to harm the people of Sunnah and prevent them from narrating the narrations of Attributes and the Vision and their likes, set. Al-Mutawakkil summoned the Muhaddithin to Samarra, gave them abundant gifts, honored them, and ordered them to narrate the Hadiths of Attributes and the Vision. Abu Bakr bin Abi Shaybah sat in the Mosque of Al-Rusafah, and about thirty thousand souls gathered to him. His brother Uthman sat in the Mosque of Al-Mansur, and about thirty thousand souls gathered to him. The supplication of the creation for Al-Mutawakkil abounded, and they exaggerated in praising him and glorifying him, until one of them said...

He took from Abu Al-Walid one hundred thousand dinars and twenty thousand dinars and jewels worth forty thousand dinars. He attended to Baghdad, and Abu Abdullah Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad had become paralyzed forty-seven days after the death of his enemy Ibn Al-Zayyat. Ibn Al-Athir mentioned in *Al-Kamil* in the events of the year 237: 'In it, Al-Mutawakkil became angry with Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad, seized his estates and properties, and imprisoned his son Abu Al-Walid and the rest of his children. He charged Abu Al-Walid one hundred thousand and twenty thousand dinars and jewels whose value was twenty thousand dinars. Then he was reconciled after that for sixteen thousand dirhams [annually/monthly?], and he made them all witness the sale of their properties' (1).\n* - Imam Ahmad's Rebuke: He hoped and requested from the companions who had a known status among the people in knowledge and piety that they not hasten in *Taqiyyah* (dissimulation) and not agree to the statement of the creation of the Quran. He saw that if they had been patient, they would have had regard with the State, and it would not have hastened to execute what the Mu'tazilah wanted from it. But when they hastened to use *Taqiyyah*, and the Imam and a few others who did not have great status among the people remained, it became easy for the State to take them on the pretext that the majority of scholars and jurists were with it.

Therefore, he used to seek excuses for Sajjadah and Al-Qawariri, to the exclusion of others. Al-Maqrizi said: Abu Abdullah used to uphold their excuse and say: 'Were they not imprisoned and shackled? Allah the Almighty said: (Except for one who is forced while his heart is secure in faith).' Abu Abdullah said: 'Shackles are coercion, imprisonment is coercion, and beating is coercion. But if one is not afflicted with something disliked, there is no excuse for him' (1). He did not excuse those who hastened to use Taqiyyah (dissimulation) when they had not yet been afflicted with harm in this path. Ibn Al-Jawzi narrated with his chain of narration from Abu Bakr Al-Marwazi saying: Yahya bin Ma'in came and entered upon Ahmad bin Hanbal while he was sick. He greeted him, but he did not return the greeting. Ahmad had sworn by the covenant not to speak to anyone who had answered [the Inquisition] until he met Allah the Almighty. Yahya kept making excuses and saying: 'The Hadith of Ammar, and Allah the Almighty said: (Except for one who is forced while his heart is secure in faith).' I saw Ahmad turn his face to the other side. Yahya said: 'Uff,' and stood up, saying: 'He does not accept an excuse from us.' I went out after him while he was sitting at the door. He said: 'What did Ahmad say after me?' I said: 'He said: He uses the Hadith of Ammar as proof, but the Hadith of Ammar is: I passed by them while they were cursing you, so I forbade them, so they beat me. Whereas you, it was said to you: We intend to beat you. So I heard Yahya say: 'By Allah, under the sky, there is no one more knowledgeable in the religion of Allah than you' (2). He [Ali bin Al-Madini] also answered in the Mihnah (Inquisition) out of fear of harm and killing, may Allah have mercy on him.

Due to that, he fell into difficult matters, to the extent that he used to speak against a group of the notables of the People of Hadith to please Ibn Abi Du'ad thereby, so Imam Ahmad shunned him for that (4).

For that reason, he abandoned narrating from those who answered during the Mihnah. Al-Uqayli said in 'Al-Du'afa': I read to Abdullah bin Ahmad the book 'Al-Ilal' from his father, and I saw in it many stories from his father from Ali bin Abdullah, then his name had been struck out, and written above it was 'A man told us,' then the entire Hadith was struck out. So I asked Abdullah, and he said: 'My father used to narrate to us from him, then he withheld his name and would say: A man told us, then he abandoned his Hadith after that.' It might be said: Those who chose Taqiyyah have their excuse, which is coercion, and they chose a permissible matter, so why did Ahmad shun them? Ibn Al-Jawzi answered this matter saying: The answer is from three aspects: First, the people were threatened and not beaten, so they answered, and a threat is not coercion (and this has become clear by what we mentioned of the Hadith of Yahya bin Ma'in). Second, he shunned them by way of discipline, so that the gravity of the statement they answered to would be known, thus preserving them from deviation. Third, it is said: Most of the people, when they answered, accepted money, frequented the people (oppressors), and sought closeness to them, so they did what is not permissible; therefore, they deserved blame and shunning (1).",

    "text": "The truth is that the Imam's shunning of those who answered in the Mihnah was only for discipline and to denounce their action, and it was not an invalidation of their probity (Adalah) in any way. His abandonment of narration from Ali bin Al-Madini and his striking out of his Hadiths is carried upon this same matter. It appears to me that abandoning narration from Ibn Al-Madini was temporary, then he narrated from him later. The clearest example of this is that we find many texts from him narrated by the Imam in this book (Al-Ilal), just as we find many narrations from him in 'Al-Musnad'. It is possible that he struck out his Hadiths and then permitted them, so his students narrated them from him. We also find many narrations from Abdullah's additions and his narrations in his father's books and his book 'Al-Sunnah' from Ibn Ma'in. It is known that Abdullah would not write Hadith nor narrate except from whom his father was pleased with and permitted him to take from. Furthermore, it is inconceivable that the Imam pardoned those who caused him harm out of blind following, yet remained angry at those who chose Taqiyyah. Yes, since his anger was for Allah and in the path of Allah, he did not pardon the innovators who made the statement of the creation of the Quran a religion for themselves and due to it harmed him with all harm, like Ibn Abi Du'ad, the head and foot of the Fitna, as previously mentioned. * - The Illness of Imam Ahmad and His Death: After a life full of knowledge and Jihad, the Imam fell ill with his fatal illness on the night of Wednesday, with two nights passed of the month of Rabi' al-Awwal in the year 241. He passed away on the tenth day of his illness, on Friday, the twelfth of Rabi' al-Awwal. He was buried after Asr, and a massive crowd, estimated at one million souls, prayed over him. May Allah have mercy on him and raise his ranks with the Prophets, the Truthful, and the Martyrs. Amen.",

Narration of Abu Ali Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Al-Hasan Al-Sawwaf. From Abu Abd Al-Rahman Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal. From his father. Hearing of Ubaydullah bin Ahmad. It appears that this is the name of the book by which Imam Ahmad, or his son Abdullah, or Abu Ali bin Al-Sawwaf named it. Whichever of these three named the book, this name is the designated one. If the one who named it was Imam Ahmad, it is clear. If it was Abdullah bin Ahmad, then it is most likely that after collecting and arranging it, he presented it and read it to his father. Likewise, if the one who named it was Abu Ali bin Al-Sawwaf, he also must have read it to Abdullah with this name, and Abdullah approved it.",

    "text": "Because the scribe of the book, Ubaydullah bin Ahmad, copied it from the original of Abu Ali, so he must have copied it with its name and then heard it from Abu Ali. We do not think the naming came from him. Therefore, we see that what is affixed to the back of the book is the name of the book, nothing else. Those who benefited from the book often shortened the mention of its name, calling it 'Al-Ilal' (The Defects). Some called it 'Al-Tarikh' (The History) because it includes the history of narrators, their births, conditions, and deaths, similar to how the three histories of Al-Bukhari and the history of Ibn Abi Khaythamah and others were named. Although these books include some defects of Hadith, since the predominant characteristic is the clarification of the conditions of men (narrators), they were named 'Tarikh'. 2 - Documentation of the Book's Attribution to Imam Ahmad: We find many scholars, both ancient and modern, who are engaged in the science of Hadith or who work on mentioning authored works in sciences and arts, when mentioning works on 'Al-Ilal' and 'Jarh wa Ta'dil' (Disparagement and Praise), or when writing the biography of Imam Ahmad, they mention the book 'Al-Ilal' attributing it to the Imam, specifically the narration of his son Abdullah—this one which is in our hands. Furthermore, the materials quoted from Abdullah bin Ahmad from his father from the book 'Al-Ilal' within the books of the predecessors align with what this book contains, as is apparent to the one looking into their sourcing. Therefore, we do not doubt that this book 'Al-Ilal' originates from the works of Imam Ahmad because the matter has become famous, indeed Mutawatir (mass transmitted), such that it leaves no room for doubt. Perhaps a speaker might say: It was not a book authored by Imam Ahmad in this sense; rather, they are questions Abdullah directed to his father, and his father answered them, so the book should be attributed to Abdullah.",

    "text": "We say that among the methods of spreading authorship in those days was that the student would write from the Sheikh while he dictated to him, or the student would ask the Sheikh sometimes and the Sheikh would answer him from his memory or from his book, so the book would spread through the student. In this way, most of the books of the Salaf (Predecessors) reached us. In this same way, Abdullah transmitted this book from his father, then added additions to it. This does not mean that the Imam did not have a book or a composition by him on this subject. What we conceive is that he had a book on Defects and Knowledge of Men in his own handwriting, like the Musnad and others. He dictated some of it to Abdullah, and some of it Abdullah asked him about, and he answered from his memory or from his book sometimes. This is indicated by those many narrations in which Abdullah says 'My father dictated to me,' and in some he says: 'I found in my father's book in his handwriting and I did not hear it.' So those he did not have dictated to him and those he found in his father's book, he appended later to the book. In any case, the existence of a book on the subject of Defects and Conditions of Men authored by Imam Ahmad is established for us, which his son Abdullah took from him by reading, dictation, and Wajadah (finding), and into which he inserted additions from his Sheikhs other than his father. Among those who mentioned the book 'Al-Ilal' of the Imam: 1 - Among the earliest of them, as far as I have seen, is Al-Uqayli Muhammad bin Umar bin Musa bin Hammad (died 322) in his book 'Al-Du'afa', where he said: I read to Abdullah bin Ahmad the book 'Al-Ilal' from his father, and I saw in it many stories from his father from Ali bin Abdullah (meaning Ibn Al-Madini), then his name had been struck out and written above it 'A man told us,' then the entire Hadith was struck out.

Abu Musa Al-Madini said: He is the leader of the People of Hadith in his time in Baghdad. Al-Silafi said: Ibn Nasir heard much with us. He is Shafi'i Ash'ari, then he moved to the Madhhab of Ahmad in fundamentals and branches and died upon it. He possesses excellence, precision, and good knowledge, and he is a firm Imam. Ibn Al-Jawzi said: He was a Hafiz (preserver), precise, exact, trustworthy, from the People of the Sunnah with no fault in him. Ibn Al-Najjar said: He was good in transmission, correct in recording, with much memorized. He had an extended hand in knowledge of grammar and language. His originals were of the utmost correctness and precision. He was trustworthy, noble, a proof, of good path, pious, poor, abstinent, clean, and integrous. He endowed his books to the People of Hadith. He died in the year 550 and left no offspring (2). When Did the Authoring of the Book 'Al-Ilal' Occur: I found a text in Al-Uqayli indicating that Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, authored the book 'Al-Ilal' before the Mihnah (Inquisition) in the Fitna of the creation of the Quran.",

    "text": "Al-Uqayli said in the biography of Ali bin Al-Madini: 'I read to Abdullah bin Ahmad the book Al-Ilal from his father, and I saw in it many stories from his father from Ali bin Abdullah, then his name had been struck out and written above it: 'A man told us,' then the entire Hadith was struck out. So I asked Abdullah and he said: My father used to narrate to us from him, then he withheld his name, and he would say: 'A man told us,' then he abandoned his Hadith after that' (1). In this is clear evidence that the authoring of 'Al-Ilal' occurred before the Imam's entry into the Mihnah, because during the days of the Mihnah he was detained and imprisoned, finding no opportunity to author a large book like this. Furthermore, the book consists of questions directed from Abdullah to his father in most cases, and Abdullah was not with him in prison. 3 - Description of the Copy: We have not found a complete copy of the book 'Al-Ilal' by Abdullah's narration other than this unique copy that is in our hands now. The twelfth part was mentioned for it by the narration of Mukram Al-Bazzar, and its description will follow. As for this copy of ours, it is from the preservation of the 'Aya Sofya' library in Turkey, registered therein with number (2380) (2). It comprises (180) leaves, size (30 x 17 cm), divided into eight parts. Each part comprises 24 leaves. Face 'A' of each part includes the title of the book and the hearings, except for the eighth part, which is in a fine script different from the script of the first seven parts.",

The script is Naskhi, usual according to the method of old scripts. As for the scribe of the book, we did not find an explicit text with his name, but some indications suggest that the scribe of the first seven parts is Ubaydullah bin Ahmad known as 'Jakhjakh', the auditor of this copy and its owner, and his biography has passed. The indication for that is the phrase established at the top of leaf (170 A) of the eighth part, which is: 'This part (meaning the second part [sic - context implies the part written by Ibrahim]) is in the handwriting of Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Yaqub bin Al-Hasan bin Al-Ma'mun; he used to listen with Abu Al-Hasan bin Furat and Ubaydullah bin Ahmad Al-Nahwi 'Jakhjakh', to whom this copy belonged. Ibn Nasir wrote it.' So the statement of Ibn Nasir, who is the firm trustworthy one, indicates that the first owner of the complete copy is Ubaydullah bin Ahmad, the holder of the hearing from Abu Ali bin Al-Sawwaf. Also indicating what is sought is the phrase established at the top of leaf (24 B): 'Read to Abu Ali bin Al-Sawwaf, on Monday, the sixth of Rajab in the year three hundred and forty-three, while I was looking at the original.' This phrase is in the handwriting of the original of the copy, with no difference whatsoever. Therefore, we see that its scribe is Ubaydullah bin Ahmad; he copied it from the original of Abu Ali",

And what came in folio 62 B right margin: 'Thus in the original of Abu Ali and in the book of Ibn Khalid...' As for the eighth part, it is not in the handwriting of Ubaydullah, but in the handwriting of his peer and companion, Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Yaqub bin Al-Hasan bin Al-Ma'mun (the Caliph), as Ibn Nasir Al-Salami confirmed to us. We did not find a separate independent biography for this Ibrahim, except that Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi said in the biography of his father Muhammad bin Yaqub: 'He had a son called Ibrahim who wrote much Hadith. Muhammad bin Abi Al-Fawaris mentioned that this Muhammad bin Yaqub died on Tuesday, the second night of Al-Muharram in the year 356, and his son Ibrahim died after him suddenly by a week.' He said: 'His birth was in the year three hundred and five (305), and I do not think he narrated' (1).

    "text": "written in the handwriting of the first scribe, who is Ubaidullah bin Ahmad. So we imagine that Ubaidullah handed over the writing to his companion in the hearing (*Sama'*), Ibrahim, for some reason, perhaps due to a shortage of paper, because Ibrahim, as it appears, was distinguished by the ability to write and the quality of calligraphy along with its precision and the smallness of his letters. Therefore, we see that this eighth part took up only (10) papers instead of (24) papers, had it been written in the previous handwriting. Thus, it is not thought that this part was written later to complete a deficiency. We can infer this by the existence of appendices (*Alhaq*) in the margins of folios (170 b), (172 b), (174 a and b), (176 a), and (178 a) of the eighth part. The handwriting of these appendices and corrections differs completely from the handwriting of the part and resembles the handwriting of the previous seven parts. As for what came at the end of the book on the last folio (180), we do not doubt that it is in the handwriting of the scribe of the first parts. It is his statement: \"Praise be to Allah alone, and may Allah bless and grant peace to Muhammad the Prophet and his family. The end of the sixth part of the parts of Abdullah, and it is the end of the book.\" Therefore, we see that some reason occurred to Ubaidullah bin Ahmad, the owner of the copy and its scribe, so he transferred the writing and copying to his companion Ibrahim bin Muhammad. When Ibrahim finished copying, Ubaidullah undertook the comparison and correction, so he established the appendices and wrote the conclusion. As for the date of copying, no explicit, clear evidence indicated it either, except that certainty is attained that the copying of the book occurred before Rajab of the year three hundred and forty-three.

The copy of the book was in the possession of its scribe and owner, Ubaidullah bin Ahmad Al-Nahwi. Then it transferred to the possession of Abu Al-Hasan Ali bin Al-Hasan bin Ahmad Al-Maqri (1). We do not know how the copy transferred to him, but after him, Al-Dhahabi possessed it and heard it by his reading to Sheikh Abu Al-Fath Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Abi Al-Fawaris, who is one of its narrators from Abu Ali bin Al-Sawwaf. Thus, the sequence of narration is established for us without interruption. Then it did not appear to us where this copy was after the death of Al-Maqri in the year 449, nor who owned it until it became the property, through purchase, of Muhammad bin Nasir bin Muhammad bin Ali Al-Salami (467 - 550). He heard it from Sheikh Abu Ghalib Ahmad bin Al-Hasan Ibn Al-Banna, who heard it from Abu Talib Al-Ashari, and he narrates it from Abu Al-Fath bin Abi Al-Fawaris and Muhammad bin Abdullah [bin] Bishran, and both of them narrate it from Abu Ali bin Al-Sawwaf.

It appears to us that the book had several copies copied by the students of Abdullah bin Ahmad, among them the copy of \"Ibn Khalid\" and the copy of \"Makram.\" And that Ubaidullah bin Ahmad compared this copy of his against these two copies. We infer this from what appears in several places in the margin of the copy, the phrase: \"Thus in the original and in the book of Ibn Khalid...\" See folio (35 b), and in it: \"In the copy of Ibn Khalid and others.\" And folios (48 b), (51 a), (63 a), (71 b), (75 a), and (83 b), and in them is the following phrase: \"In the book of Ibn Khalid [it is] 'Ali' and it is not in the original; it fell from it.\" And (85 a), (109 a), (110 a), (122 b), (123 b), and (123 b) as well, and in it: In the original \"I asked my father...\" while in the margin it is thus: \"In the copy of Makram and Ibn Khalid: I asked Yahya.\" All these comparisons and corrections are in the handwriting of the original [scribe] of the copy.

I have not been guided to him after wonder and research. It is also proven to us that \"Makram\" also had a complete copy of the book *Al-'Ilal*, and he is also one of the students of Abdullah. The scribe compared his copy with it. This Makram is: Makram bin Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Makram, Abu Bakr, the Judge (*Qadi*), the Cloth Merchant (*Bazzaz*). He heard from Yahya bin Abi Talib, Ahmad bin Ubaidullah Al-Narsi, Ahmad bin Ali Al-Abbar, and others. Al-Khatib said: He was trustworthy (*Thiqa*). He died on Thursday, the fifth of Jumada al-Ula in the year three hundred and forty-five (1). One might deduce from the phrases that appeared in the margins: \"Beginning of the part... from the parts of Abdullah,\" or \"End of the part...\" that the scribe of this copy, Ubaidullah bin Ahmad, undertook the comparison of his copy with the copy of Abdullah bin Ahmad as well. However, I see that this deduction is not correct, and I do not think that Ubaidullah bin Ahmad found or saw the copy of Abdullah, the son of Imam Ahmad. For had he found it, he would have compared his copy with it and established the differences or corrected his copy in light of it, and we do not find any indication of this matter. So I consider it more likely that he found in the copy of Abu Ali bin Al-Sawwaf—who differed in his division from the division of Abdullah bin Ahmad, so he (i.e., Ibn Al-Sawwaf) established the beginning and end of Abdullah's parts—written like this.

It appears that Imam Ahmad used to record these various materials in days, and even in different years, so he did not observe, or rather: it was not possible for him to have a special arrangement for narrators in classes (*Tabaqat*), nor in alphabetical letters, nor in Sheikhs and students, and other considerations of arrangement. Similarly, he did not observe arrangement and categorization in the Fiqh-based hadiths, whether defective or non-defective. Imam Ahmad narrated this collection to Abdullah as it is. This section is expressed by Abdullah with his saying: \"I heard my father...\" Also, the large part of the book consists of Question and Answer. Abdullah directed the question to his father regarding the various daily issues that would confront him regarding narrators and their hadiths, and the Imam answered it, so Abdullah recorded it and placed it beside what his father narrated to him on different occasions without a question from him.

    "text": "He may arrange some materials for specific purposes. Such as when he said: \"These men are those whom Mis'ar narrated from among the people of Kufa and others, and Shu'bah did not hear from them...\" And he said in another place: \"And these are those whom Shu'bah narrated from and Sufyan did not narrate from...\" And he said in another place: \"From Shu'bah that he said: I saw Muhammad bin Al-Muntashir and Habib bin Salim,\" so he listed those whom Shu'bah saw. And he said in another place: \"These are those whom Sufyan narrated from and Shu'bah did not narrate from...\" so he mentioned them. This is regarding the arrangement of subjects. As for the types of materials and subjects, we can assert that the book comprised the majority of the sciences of Hadith. Regarding defects (*'Ilal*) of Hadith, he mentions hadiths from every chapter and indicates the type of defect in them, such as *Irsal* (disconnection at the end), *I'dal* (omission of two or more consecutive narrators), *Inqita'* (disconnection), and being *Shadh* (odd) or *Munkar* (denounced) or from the unique reports (*Afrad*) of the narrator, and disturbance (*Idtirab*), interpolation (*Idraj*), misreading (*Tashif*), distortion (*Tahrif*), and others. He also mentions regarding narrators: births and deaths, trustworthy and weak, confused (*Mukhtalit*) and obfuscator (*Mudallis*), the creed of the narrator—Sunnah, Shi'ism, Qadar (free will), Nasb (hatred of Ali)—and Kunyas, names, lineages, and tribes, Kunyas of those known by names, names of those known by Kunyas, the Agreeing and Dispersing (*Al-Mu'talif wa Al-Mukhtalif*) and the Resembling (*Mutashabih*), ambiguous names (*Mubhamat*), and other than that. He may mention the chain of narration (*Isnad*) in full and mention its text (*Matn*) at length, and the purpose of it is to clarify the hearing and reporting of a Mudallis, for example, or another purpose. Such as what is said: In the first text in the book, and in it also is an indication that Hushaym was the first from whom the author heard",

    "text": "Hadith. Just as mentioned in the biography of Imam Ahmad. He may mention the Isnad and not mention the Matn with it, and the purpose of it is to clarify the lineage of the narrator or his Kunya, or something else; see text (46). He may mention a text and no relevance to the subject of the book appears for it, but with scrutiny and precision, the relevance and benefit appear. An example of that is what he said in text (16): \"My father told me: Hushaym told us, saying: One of them claimed to me, saying: Al-Hajjaj wrote that Ibrahim bin Yazid should be taken to his governor. When the letter came to him, he said: So he wrote to him: 'We have before us Ibrahim bin Yazid Al-Taymi and Ibrahim bin Yazid Al-Nakha'i, so which of them shall we take?' He said: So he wrote: 'Take them both.' Hushaym said: As for Ibrahim Al-Nakha'i, he was not found until he died, and as for Ibrahim Al-Taymi, he was taken and died in prison.\" This narration, on its surface, is not related to defects and knowledge of men, but if we look closely, we find that it was cited for important Hadith benefits, among them clarifying the Agreed and Separated (*Al-Muttafiq wa Al-Muftariq*) of names, and how they can be distinguished. When Ibrahim bin Yazid was mentioned absolutely, it became ambiguous and the intended one was not designated. When each one was attributed with his specific lineage, the distinction occurred. And among them is clarifying the contemporaneity between them and their being in one city, for example. He may mention a narration to clarify a defect or infirmity in the narrator, for example, he said in text (128 a) from Yazid bin Harun from Abdul-Malik bin Abi Sulaiman, who said: \"A man used to invite me and Sa'id bin Jubayr for the whole month of Ramadan. He said: So they mentioned the night of Nabidh (date wine). Sa'id said: I do not see any harm in it in the water-skin (*Siqa'*), but I dislike it in the green jar (*Al-Jarr Al-Akhdar*). He said:",

Since I did not find another copy for the book, the need increased to review its texts in the books of the art which quoted these texts from the Imam. I was successful with most of them in the books available to us, and I established their locations by designating the volume and page in the footnote. There is no doubt that comparing several copies of a book, if they exist, and collating them with the original corrects the text or brings it closer to correctness. However, the need remains to reference the texts in their likely sources if the investigator seeks precision and honesty in investigation and correction. When copies are missing, the importance of returning to the likely places and sources that benefited from the book increases, and in this work, there is fatigue, hardship, and spending of time of which Allah is Aware. So I reviewed the texts as much as possible, and if I found a difference among those quoting from him, I drew attention to it.\n5 - I wrote brief biographies for the men of the chain of narration, mentioning the oldest references for them and mentioning *Al-Tahdhib* if the biography was found in it.\n6 - I extracted (*Kharrajtu*) the hadiths and judged them as Authentic (*Sahih*), Good (*Hasan*), and Weak (*Da'if*).",

And if anyone opposed him, I established it. I did the same regarding if he attributed him to a tribe or a city or mentioned him with an infirmity, and so on.

Then it began to recede for forty days. Then Noah landed on Judi. The Ark had performed Hajj with Noah; it stood with him at the standing of Arafah, then it moved with him just as the pilgrim moves, then it spent the night at Muzdalifah, then it moved on, then it began to stand with him at the Jamarat, then it poured forth with him to the House (Kaaba) and circumambulated it seven times, and went between Safa and Marwa seven times. The water rose above the tallest mountain on earth a distance of five months journey upwards. Ma'mar claimed that the water rose above everything by fifteen cubits—or he said fathoms. Rabah said: It reached me that the tree from which Noah made the Ark sprouted when Noah was born; its length was three hundred cubits and its width eighty or sixty cubits.

The hadith is only the hadith of Ayyub from Ibn Abi Mulaykah from Abu Al-Zinad from some of the Kufans. I said to him: 'How is Bistam?' He said: 'There is no harm in him; he is Salih Al-Hadith (good in hadith).' 1294 - I heard my father say: The son of Isma'il b. Ulayyah spoke to his father about listening to Ibn Al-Shadhakuni narrate to him. So he began asking him about opinion (Ra'y)—the opinions of men—Ibn Awn from Muhammad. And Ibn Ulayyah used to like good hadith that had a chain of transmission (Isnad), and Isma'il did not like the opinion of men. So Isma'il said to his son: 'Didn't you say this is a man of Hadith?'—as if he did not like it when he began asking him about opinion.",

He said: I have seen him, and he resembles the people of Hadith or resembles the people [of piety]. He denied this [accusation] and rejected it. Then he said: Perhaps the Shaykh grew old and became confused. When we saw him, he resembled the people [of virtue]; I only knew him to seek truthfulness. Then he said: Abu Qatadah went out to Al-Awza'i. When he was on part of the road, he met a group who had returned from Al-Awza'i. Abu Qatadah said to them: \"Audition (Sama') or Presentation (Ard)?\" They said to him: \"You will surely know.\" I think it was Miskin or someone else who said this to Abu Qatadah.

He said: Abu Mu'awiyah in quantity and knowledge—meaning knowledgeable about Al-A'mash. I said to him: Which of the companions of Al-Zuhri is most stable? He said: Every one of them has a defect (illnah), except that Yunus and Uqayl convey the wordings, and Shu'ayb bin Abi Hamzah. But they are not like Ma'mar; Ma'mar approaches them in the Isnad. I said: Then Malik? He said: Malik is the most stable in everything. But these have quantity; how much does Malik have? Three hundred Hadiths or something like that. And Ibn Uyainah has around three hundred Hadiths. Then he said: These are the ones who narrated a lot from Al-Zuhri: Yunus, Uqayl, and Ma'mar. I said to him: Shu'ayb? He said: Shu'ayb is little [in narrations]. These have more Hadith from Al-Zuhri. I said: Then Salih bin Kaysan, his narration from Al-Zuhri? He said: Salih is older than Al-Zuhri; Salih saw Ibn Umar. I said: So these are the companions of Al-Zuhri. I said: The most stable of them is Malik? He said: Yes, Malik is the most stable of them. But these are the ones who split open the knowledge of Al-Zuhri: Yunus, Uqayl, and Ma'mar. I said to him: So after Malik, who do you see? He said: Ibn Uyainah. I said to him: Al-Muwaqqiri, wonders come from him. He said: That one is nothing. My father said: Al-Zuhri was a homely, short man; he did not have that nobility; he was not handsome.

He had only heard a small amount from Sufyan, but he (falsely) claimed to have heard the 'Jami' from Sufyan. 3606 - My father dictated to me from his books regarding Abu Hazim. He said: Abu Hazim Al-Ashja'i, his name is Salman, the client of Azzah, Kufan. Al-A'mash, Mansur, Sayyar, Yazid bin Kaysan, Talhah bin Musarrif, and Bashir Abu Ismail narrated from him. And Abu Hazim whose name is Nabtal. Ismail bin Abi Khalid narrated from him. I do not know anyone who narrated from him other than Ibn Abi Khalid. And Abu Hazim who speaks on asceticism (Zuhd) is Al-Madini Al-A'raj (the lame); his name is Salamah bin Dinar, he is called Al-Afzar, the client of Al-Aswad bin Sufyan. And Abu Hazim Al-Tammar, also Medinan. Muhammad bin Ibrahim narrated from him. I do not know what his name is, and I do not think anyone narrated from him other than Muhammad bin Ibrahim. And Abu Hazim Maysarah, Al-Thawri narrated from him. All of them are trustworthy—meaning those with the Kunyah Abu Hazim. 3607 - I heard him say: I gave Zuhair bin Harb the Kunyah Abu Khaythamah. We were with Abu Mu'awiyah, and Abu Khaythamah asked him to dictate to us. His Kunyah was Abu Muhammad or Abu Ahmad. Abu Mu'awiyah said to him: 'You have become famous (Mushahhar) today, O Abu Khaythamah.'",

Abdurrahman bin Mahdi said: 'When we gave Sakhr bin Juwayriyah [Hadith] to read to us, it did not match what he was reading to us, until we took the book of Gundar. So he would read to us based on what was in Gundar's book'—meaning that it was a correct book. 3609 - My father said: Only those who heard from Shu'bah heard from Sakhr. My father said: And Juwayriyah bin Asma', there is no [harm] in him—trustworthy. 3610 - My father said: I saw Sunayd with Hajjaj bin Muhammad while he was hearing the book 'Al-Jami' from him—meaning Ibn Jurayj's. In the book, it said: 'Ibn Jurayj said: I was informed from Yahya bin Sa'id,' and 'I was informed from Al-Zuhri,' and 'I was informed from Safwan bin Sulaym.' But Sunayd started saying to Hajjaj: 'Say: O Abu Muhammad, Ibn Jurayj from Al-Zuhri, and Ibn Jurayj from Yahya bin Sa'id, and Ibn Jurayj from Safwan bin Sulaym.' So he would say it like that to him. My father did not praise what he saw him doing with Hajjaj and blamed him for that. My father said: And some of these Hadiths that Ibn Jurayj used to send (Mursal) are fabricated Hadiths. Ibn Jurayj did not care from where he took it—meaning his saying 'I was informed' and 'It was narrated from So-and-so.'",

Abu Kamil was among the people of Hadith. When Sharik arrived, they said: 'We are not satisfied with anyone asking him except Abu Kamil.' He was counted among the people of virtue in those days. Ibn Mahdi used to say to me: 'What does Abu Kamil say about a Hadith from the Hadith of Ibrahim bin Sa'd?' 3617 - I asked my father: 'Which of the companions of Ibrahim are most beloved to you?'

But the gates of the sky were opened, and the water of the sky came, and the earth was a sea. Noah remained in the Ark from the time he boarded it until it was said: {O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold} [Hud: 44] for six months and some days. Then it began to recede for forty days. Then Noah landed on Judi. The Ark had performed Hajj with Noah; it stood at the standing place of Arafah, then departed as the pilgrim departs, then spent the night at Muzdalifah, then departed, then stood with him at the Jamarat, then proceeded with him to the House (Kaaba) and circumambulated it seven times, and went between Safa and Marwa seven times. The water rose above the highest mountain on earth by a distance of five months ascending.' And Ma'mar claimed that the water rose fifteen cubits—or he said fathoms. Rabah said: 'It reached me that the tree from which Noah made the Ark sprouted when Noah was born. Its height was three hundred cubits and its width was eighty or sixty cubits.'

He said: \"I was present with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in the year of Hunayn when he gave them the Khums (one-fifth share) together, excluding Banu Abd Manaf.\" If seniority was found in Banu Hashim, he gave it precedence, and if it was in Banu Al-Muttalib, he gave it precedence. He used to do the same with all the tribes, inviting them according to age. Then he looked, and the kinship of Banu Abd Shams and Banu Nawfal to the Prophet (peace be upon him) was equal to him. He saw that Abd Shams was the full brother of Hashim (by mother) unlike Nawfal, so he considered him closer due to this. He also saw in them precedence [in Islam] and marriage ties to the Prophet (peace be upon him) which Banu Nawfal did not have, so he prioritized their call over the call of Banu Nawfal, then [Nawfal] after them. Then the kinship of Banu Asad b. Abd Al-Uzza and Banu Abd Al-Dar became equal to him. He saw that Banu Asad had precedence and marriage ties—meaning to the Prophet (peace be upon him)—and that they were from the Mutayyabin (Scented Ones) and from the Hilf al-Fudul (Alliance of Virtues), and that they were more defensive of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), so he prioritized them over Banu Abd Al-Dar. Then he placed Banu Abd Al-Dar after them. Then he considered the family of Banu Zuhrah, and no one disputes them. Then the kinship of Banu Taym b. Murrah and Banu Makhzum b. Yaqzah b. Murrah became equal to him. He saw that Banu Taym had precedence and marriage ties to the Prophet (peace be upon him), for Banu Taym were from the Mutayyabin and from the Hilf al-Fudul, so he prioritized them over Banu Makhzum. Then he placed Banu Makhzum after them. Then the kinship of Banu Jumah, Sahm, and Adi b. Ka'b—his own clan—became equal to him. He said: \"As for Banu Adi b. Ka'b and Sahm, they are together, and that is because Islam entered upon them while they were like that. But with whom do you see that I should begin? With Sahm or Jumah? Indeed, I see that I should begin with Jumah, but I do not know if seniority belongs to Jumah or the other.\" Then he placed Banu Sahm and Banu Adi after them. Then he placed Banu Amir b. Lu'ayy, then Banu Fihr. They claimed that when Abu Ubaydah b.

I asked the people of knowledge among his companions about that, and they denied it and said: Abu Ubaydah is from Banu Muharib b. Fihr, not from Banu Al-Harith. This claim of precedence is misplaced for Banu Al-Harith, not for Banu Muharib. Rather, Mu'awiyah b.
