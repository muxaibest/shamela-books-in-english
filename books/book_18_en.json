"text": "As for the first treatise: It speaks about the measures of Ritls, their differences, and their adjustment using Dirhams. In it, the author compared Iraqi Ritls with other Ritls of horizon lands; such as the Damascene, Egyptian, Laythi, Alexandrian, Baalbaki, Tabarani, Jerusalemite (Qudsi), Nabulsi, Himsi, Aleppine (Halabi), Beiruti, Hamawi, Basri, Makki, Madani, and others. Thus, this treatise—despite its small size—preserved for us important information regarding the difference between these Ritls in weight, which we rarely find in the printed books circulating in our hands. In addition to adjusting these Ritls and calculating how to convert measures to them using other legal measures; such as the Sa', the Two Qullas (Qullatayn), and the like. It also shows us the method of the scholars of the tenth century in some mathematical problems and algebra with two unknowns. The Ritl is used as a unit of volume (Kayl) mostly, and it may be used as a unit of weight in certain instances (1).",
"foot_note": "1. Abu al-Abbas al-Azafi al-Sabti (633 AH) said in his book [Ithbat Ma Laisa Minhu Budd, p. 142]: (The Ritl is a masculine noun, pronounced with a Fatha on the Ra or a Kasra. It is a name for a quantity of weighed items estimated by custom, not by original linguistic placement. It is also a name for what weighed items are calibrated with, made of iron, copper, lead, or stone. It may also be a name for what is used to measure volume, like the Mudd and the Sa'). Al-Azhari said in [Al-Muzhir]: (It is both a measure of volume and weight).",

The amount of the (Ritl) and its volume varies according to the convention of the people of the regions; as Al-Jurjani mentioned in (Al-Ta'rifat) (3). Sheikh Abu Al-Hasan Al-Mawardi (Died 450 AH) said: (The people of every region have agreed upon Ritls that differ in increase and decrease... and in localities, there are different Ritls used for transactions in the markets, and I have not heard that the Ritl of one town matched another except rarely) (4). Al-Shirazi said: (The people of every region and country have agreed in transactions upon Ritls that differ in increase and decrease, especially the people of the Levant specifically) (5).",
"foot_note": "1. Ibn Muflih mentioned in [Al-Furu' 4/77] that the estimation of volume measures was transferred to weight so that it would be preserved and transmitted.\n2. Dr. Sameh Fahmi mentions in his book (Al-Makayil fi Sadr al-Islam, p. 46) that the Ritl is a measure for liquids only; inferring from the poet's saying: 'She has a Ritl in which she measures oil ... and a farmer driving a donkey with it.' But this inference does not rise to the level of restricting this measure to liquids only, for many heritage texts have come measuring meat, bread, and other things by the Ritl, which indicates that the Ritl is a measure not exclusive to liquids only.\n3.

Ibn Al-Humam (Died 861 AH) said: (The Ritl and the Uqiyyah are differed upon by the custom of the metropolises, and within a single metropolis, the matter of sold goods differs) (2). Indeed, it was mentioned that the people of a single town deal with more than one Ritl; for meat and for bread there is a different Ritl, and they differ from the Ritl of other needs, and so on (3). Even Ibn Duraid, the well-known linguist (Died 321 AH), said: (The Ritl is a measure whose amount I do not know) (4). This difference in volume measures (and likewise the difference in circulating weights) causes much confusion and difficulty; therefore, Omar bin Abdul Aziz (Died 101 AH) intended to unify the volume measures and weights, as it was reported that he wrote to his workers: (We see that the perfection of the land's measure and its scale is that it be one in the entire land) (5).",

"text": "This matter, even if it was not accomplished in that time politically (and was accomplished centuries later), the Muslim scholars did not neglect this aspect its due right of research and examination. This was not limited to those who wrote on arithmetic and algebra only, but extended to the jurists of the Sharia and its scholars, so they cared about the differences between Ritls and their measures. We see many of them talking about this subject in jurisprudential books, books of Sharia politics, or in the books of scribes and land-tax (Kharaj) officers, and even in travelogues as well. Professor Ahmad Faris Al-Shidyaq mentions when he visited Britain in the year 1848 AD the amount of the English Ritl and that it equals about 150 Dirhams (1), and in doing so, he was following the sunnah of the predecessors, for the book of Al-Maqdisi preserved for us many of these measures until it was considered an important reference for many who wrote on this subject.",

"text": "Muslim jurists were concerned with defining the amounts of units of volume and weight with a clear, distinct definition for fear of falling into sin and fraud (Tatfif), and this was entrusted to the Muhtasibs (market inspectors) and made one of their duties. As for their concern with estimating the volume of the Ritl specifically, it is because the jurists relied on it and made it a standard for volume. Abu Muhammad Ibn Al-Qattan (Died after 647 AH) said: (We only looked into the meaning of the Ritl from the perspective of understanding the mentioned Mudd, not because it occurs in the wording of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in this chapter or in others) (1).

"text": "The Second Treatise authored by Sheikh Musa Al-Hajjawi: A Fatwa the Sheikh was asked about regarding dates if they are kneaded and become a paste; are they considered weighed or measured by volume? And subsequently, is it valid to sell these kneaded dates for weighed meat? Or not? Discussion on this issue abounded among Hanbali jurists at that time; such as the Sheikhs Al-Shuwayki Al-Dimashqi, Ahmed bin Atwa, Abdullah bin Rahma the two Najdis, and others from those before and after them who were contemporary to this issue. I have collected their names and their words in the footnotes of this treatise. Sheikh Musa wrote this brief treatise to arbitrate between his two sheikhs, Al-Shuwayki and Ahmed bin Yahya bin Atwa. Perhaps this fatwa complements the research of this issue by the notable jurists of the School of Imam Ahmed at that time, and is the final knot in it—as I reckon—for I have not found it raised after him. The Third Treatise: An answer to a question Sheikh Musa Al-Hajjawi was asked, regarding if there is a contradiction between what he wrote in \"Al-Iqna\" and in \"Hashiyat Al-Tanqih\", with what is in \"Al-Tanqih\" by Al-Mardawi? Which one takes precedence? Then a comment by the scholar Sheikh Muhammad Ibn Dhahlan on this fatwa.",

Third: Naming the treatise: I did not find a name for this treatise in the manuscript, nor did I find its name in the books of biographers, so I gave it a name taken from the author's introduction, for he said: (This is a useful rule—God Willing—benefiting the beginner, and aiding the advanced scholar in knowing Iraqi Ritls via Damascene weights, and others of the horizon lands).",

"foot_note": "1. The author summarized these topics in a rule he mentioned in (Hawashi Al-Tanqih p. 78) saying: (A rule from which Iraqi weights are known by the Egyptian, Damascene, Jerusalemite, Aleppine, and Ba'li Ritl. If you add to the Iraqi weights in the Two Qullas and others a like amount five times and a quarter of a like amount, then take one-seventh of the total, it is the Egyptian. If you add a like amount of an eighth, then take one-seventh of the total, it is the Jerusalemite. If you add a like amount of a quarter, then take one-seventh of the total, it is the Aleppine. And if you take one-seventh of the Iraqi without increase, it is the Ba'li).\n2. Estimation was restricted to Iraqi Ritls; because the early Hanbali authors used to estimate volume with them; and most of them were Hanbalis of Iraq; among them for example: Abu Ali Ibn Abi Musa (Died 428 AH) in (Al-Irshad p. 21), Abu Al-Khattab Al-Kalwadhani (Died 510 AH) in (Al-Hidayah 1/11), Al-Samari (Died 616 AH) in (Al-Mustaw'ib 1/10), Al-Ba'qubi (617 AH), Ibn Tamim (Died 675 AH) in (Mukhtasarihi 1/36), Abu Talib Al-Basri (Died 684 AH) in (Al-Hawi Al-Saghir p. 20), and (Al-Hawi Al-Kabir 1/77, 142), Ibn Hamdan (Died 695 AH) in (Al-Ri'ayah Al-Sughra 1/328), Al-Dujayli (Died 732 AH) in (Al-Wajiz 1/113). They were followed by Al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudamah (620 AH) in his books (Al-Kafi 1/17), (Al-Mughni), and (Al-Muqni'). As for (Al-Umdah), he estimated it by the Damascene. This is what the Damascene Hanbali authors followed; such as: Yusuf Ibn Abdul Hadi (Died 909 AH) in (Al-Durr Al-Naqi 1/50), Ibn Al-Najjar in (Al-Muntaha 1/21), and Ibn Balban (Died 1083 AH) in (Akhsar Al-Mukhtasarat 1/45 with Kashf Al-Mukhaddarat). While the Egyptian Hanbali authors relied on estimating the Two Qullas by the Egyptian Ritl; such as Al-Bahuti (Died 1059 AH) in (Umdat Al-Fiqh p. 11), and Ibn Qa'id Al-Najdi then Al-Masri in (Hidayat Al-Raghib 1/20). As for the Ba'li Hanbalis, they mentioned the previous three together, and added to them its estimation by the Ba'li Ritl; like Muhammad Ibn Balban Al-Ba'li (Died 1083 AH) in (Kafi Al-Mubtadi p.), and Ahmed Al-Ba'li (Died 1083 AH) in (Al-Rawd Al-Nadi 1/27). As for the Harranis, they mentioned them by the Harrani Ritl, like Ibn Tamim in (Mukhtasarihi 3/248).",

"foot_note": "1. Jurists estimated volume measures by weight; due to the lack of an agreed-upon measure for area among the ancients, as the sizes of volume measures often change; Al-Hajjawi (the author of this treatise) said in his book (Hawashi Tanqih p. 127): (The Wasq, the Sa', and the Mudd are volume measures that were transferred to weight because they are not consistent). This issue—estimating volume measures by weight—was and still is a point of confusion for many jurists, to the point that Ibn Al-Fakhar Al-Qurtubi Al-Maliki (Died 419 AH) said objecting to those who did that: (The measured volume is not known by weight, and weight is not known by measured volume, and whatever was originally weight, the volume in it is unknown) [Al-Tabsira fi Naqd Al-Risala by Ibn Al-Fakhar p. 108].\n2. Sheikh Taqi al-Din mentioned that the custom of the Prophet (peace be upon him) was to estimate measurable things by their vessels; like the Sa', the Wasq, the Qillas, and the like [Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra 1/216].\n3. One needs to know the volume in the chapters of purification to estimate the water that does not carry impurity, which is what exceeds two Qullas. And to know the amount with which it is recommended to perform ablution, which is a Mudd, or to perform Ghusl with, which is a Sa'.\n4. The amount mentioned in the text for Zakat of grains is (The Wasq).\n5. This is a branch based on the disagreement of jurists regarding Zakat on honey. The well-known view of the Hanbali school is the obligation of Zakat on it and that its Nisab is ten Faraqs, each Faraq being sixty Ritls. [Masa'il Al-Kawsaj 1/275, Al-Sharh Al-Kabir and Al-Insaf 6/567].\n6. Expiations, Zakat of produce from the earth, and Zakat al-Fitr are estimated by the unit of Sa' or half of it, or by the Mudd and its double, depending on the type of expiation, while observing the disagreement of scholars on that, and the type of food given.",

Al-Hajjawi mentioned here that the Ritl mentioned in the books of jurists is indeed the Iraqi Ritl. This is true, as estimation by the Iraqi Ritl is predominant among jurists, to the point that Al-Muhibb Al-Tabari said: (It is the Legal [Shar'i] Ritl) [Kifayat Al-Akhyar 1/382]. However, Ibn Muflih mentioned in (Al-Mubdi' 3/381) that the Iraqi Ritl was not in the text of Ahmed, but rather the Meccan one was. Among the texts from Imam Ahmed regarding estimating the Ritl, is what Al-Athram narrated, he said: Abu Abdullah was asked: If he took thirteen and a third Ritls of flour, baked it, and divided the bread among ten poor people? He said: (I prefer what the bread came to be a Mudd of wheat, and I hope this suffices him) [Al-Riwayatayn wa Al-Wajhayn by Judge Abu Ya'la 2/188]. In (Masa'il Abdullah p. 170) I said: How many Ritls is the Sa'? He said: (We estimated it as five Ritls and a third of wheat). Imam Ahmed also said: (The Mudd is a Ritl and a third) [Masa'il Abdullah p. 186, Masa'il Harb 188 manuscript]. Abdullah said [his Masa'il 389]: I asked my father: About a man who bequeathed that expiations for oaths be paid on his behalf, how should it be given in charity? He said: (The least of oaths is three oaths, each poor person is given at least a Mudd of wheat; which is a Ritl and a third of flour, or three Ritls minus a third of dates for every poor person). In (Masa'il of his son Salih 189): I said: How many Ritls is the Sa'? He said: (We estimated it, so it is five Ritls and a third of wheat or dates).",

Regarding the weight of the Iraqi Ritl, there are four sayings in the School; narrated in (Al-Insaf 1/122) and others: First: What the author mentioned, and corrected, that the Ritl weighs one hundred and twenty-eight Dirhams, and four-sevenths of a Dirham. He corrected it in (Al-Insaf) and said: \"And upon this is the majority of the Companions\", and said in (Al-Mubdi' 1/59): \"And it is the famous one\", and the author relied on it in (Al-Iqna' 1/13). Sheikh Taqi al-Din chose it (Majmu' Al-Fatawa 21/52, and 25/51). It is the School for the Shafi'is [Tahrir Al-Tanbih p. 110, Al-Majmu' 1/180, Al-Iqna' by Al-Shirbini 1/222], and some Maliki jurists corrected it [Mawahib Al-Jalil 2/279]. Second: That it is one hundred and twenty-eight and three-sevenths of a Dirham. [See: Sharh Al-Zarkashi 'Ala Al-Khiraqi 1/125]. He said in (Al-Insaf): \"Al-Zarkashi transmitted it from the author of Al-Talkhis in it, but I did not find in the copy I have except like the previous School view\" End quote. Third: That it weighs one hundred and twenty-eight Dirhams; which is in the old (Al-Mughni). It is a saying among the Malikis [See: Al-Dhakhira 3/78, Mawahib Al-Jalil 2/279], and a saying among the Shafi'i jurists [See: Al-Majmu' 1/180]. Abu Muhammad Ibn Al-Qattan said: (It is the school of the masses of scholars) [See: Takhrij Al-Dalalat Al-Sam'iyyah by Al-Khuzai p. 615]. Fourth: That it weighs one hundred and thirty Dirhams. Mentioned in (Al-Ri'ayah). It is a saying among the Malikis. See: Al-Dhakhira 3/77, Ithbat Ma Laisa Minhu Budd p. 77. It is what Al-Rafi'i mentioned in (Al-Aziz), and Ibn Al-Ukhuwwa in (Ma'alim Al-Qurba p. 82) as the saying of the Shafi'is. Al-Nawawi said in (Al-Majmu' 6/16): (It is strange and weak), and said in (I'anat Al-Talibin 1/31): (It is contrary to the relied-upon view). Ibn Al-Rif'ah said: (The transmitters differed regarding the Baghdadi Ritl. It was said: It is one hundred and twenty-eight Dirhams. And it was said: One hundred and twenty-eight Dirhams and four-sevenths of a Dirham, and this is what Al-Nawawi corrected. And it was said: One hundred and thirty Dirhams, which is what is implied by the citation of Sheikh Abu Ishaq, author of Al-Muhadhdhab. And it is the corrected view according to others, and it is what the soul feels is correct based on experience... etc.) See: Al-Idah wa Al-Tibyan fi Ma'rifat Al-Mikyal wa Al-Mizan by Ibn Al-Rif'ah p. 36, 37. Ibn Zhahira said in (Kifayat Al-Muhtaj p. 327): (It is what the soul feels is correct based on experience), then he mentioned what supports it and elaborated. Some jurists explained this view; Ibn Muflih said in (Al-Mubdi' 1/199): (The Iraqi Ritl is one hundred Dirhams and twenty-eight and four-sevenths of a Dirham, which is ninety Mithqals, and the Mithqal is a Dirham and three-sevenths of a Dirham; this was how it was of old. Then they added a Mithqal to it and made it ninety-one Mithqals, completing one hundred and thirty Dirhams, intending by that the removal of the fraction, but the practice is upon the first because it is what existed at the time the scholars estimated the Mudd with it).

Al-Mawardi said: (And the Ritl is twelve Uqiyyahs... there is no dispute on this) [Al-Rutba p. 170]. Abu al-Abbas Ibn al-Banna al-Marrakushi (Died 721 AH) pointed out the difference in estimating the Uqiyyah of Ritls, and that it is other than the linguistic Uqiyyah, saying: (The Uqiyyah by which the Ritl is estimated. It is said: It is the weight of ten and two-thirds Dirhams, which is the view of the jurist Abu Yahya al-Mawwaq and Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Farjun...

Al-Rutba by Al-Mawardi p. 170, Nihayat Al-Rutba by Al-Shirazi p. 15, Ma'alim Al-Qurba by Ibn Al-Ukhuwwa p. 82. See: Hashiyat Ibn Abidin 2/365, Kifayat Al-Muhtaj 1/382, Hashiyat Al-Bajirami 'Ala Al-Iqna' 2/20, Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra by Ibn Taymiyyah 1/221, Hawashi Al-Iqna' by Al-Bahuti 1/66. Ibn Abidin Al-Dimashqi commented after mentioning this view saying: (The commentator stated... that the Shami [Damascene] Ritl is six hundred Dirhams... and based on this, the Sa' in the Shami Ritl is a Ritl and a half... And I saw this also written in the handwriting of the Sheikh of our Sheikhs Ibrahim Al-Saehani and the Sheikh of our Sheikhs Mulla Ali Al-Turkmani, and they suffice as role models. However, I calculated half a Sa' in the year 1226 and found it to be two-eights and about two-thirds of an eighth, so it is approximately a Mudd, leveled without heaping. This does not contradict what passed, because the Mudd in our time is larger than the previous Mudd, and likewise the Ritl in our time exceeds seven hundred Dirhams. This is based on estimating the Sa' with mung beans or lentils, but regarding estimating it with wheat or barley, which is more precautious as will come shortly, half a Sa' exceeds that). Ibn Badran Al-Dimashqi (Died 1346 AH) said: (The Damascene Ritl of old was six hundred Dirhams, and it is now eight hundred Dirhams). See: His Hashiyah on Akhsar Al-Mukhtasarat p. 132. This indicates that the Damascene Ritl's estimation changed with the change of time, and thus the resolution to Ibn Abidin's confusion appears.\n3. What is between the brackets is missing from the original, and is necessary for the statement to make sense. The correction is benefited from (Al-Iqna') by the author, and the following sources.\n4. A similar estimation is in: Al-Furu' 1/87, Al-Mubdi' 1/59, Al-Insaf 1/122, Sharh Al-Muntaha, and Al-Rawd Al-Nadi 1/27. In (Al-Umdah by Al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudamah p. 3): (The Two Qullas are what approximates one hundred and eight Ritls in the Damascene). This indicates that it is by approximation not exactness; as Ibn Bassam said in (His Hashiyah on Al-Umdah).\n5. He said in (Sharh Al-Muntaha): (And what matches it in its amount, like the Safadi).",

The Answer: If one sells a volume-measured item (Makyul) for a weighed item (Mawzun) on credit, it is permissible (3).

"foot_note": "1. (Jubila) meaning kneaded.\n2. Meaning the dates are kneaded with feet, so the dates become like dough, which is what is called among us as (Al-Abit), and some nowadays call it in the markets (Ma'jun Al-Tamr/Date Paste). This type cannot be imagined to be measured by volume, but only by weight.\n3. See: Kashshaf Al-Qina' 8/10.\n4. It came in the book \"Al-'Aami Al-Fasih\" from the publications of the Language Academy in Cairo the text: (Al-Ajwa: A type of the finest dates in Madinah. And the common people define Ajwa as dates that are mixed one part with another and piled up). The second meaning is the author's intent, for he means by Ajwa the dates if mixed before kneading, so the author's usage is indeed the colloquial usage of the word, not the classical one. As for our time now, some people do not call dates \"Ajwa\" unless after kneading, so (Ajwa) is written on kneaded dates. So be aware of this difference in the usage of the word.\n5. The style expressed by the author is one of the uncommon styles, where he entered (An) the infinitive particle on the conjugatable past verb. It is a dialect permitted by some grammarians. Al-Zawawi said in (Nazm Qawa'id Al-I'rab): (An) is a particle of infinitude that makes the imperfect accusative ... And the saying regarding it meeting the past tense is disturbed. And (An) here can be interpreted as a source (Masdar), so the sentence is: (Before its kneading); evidenced by the fact that he conjoined it with a source (Masdar) which is his saying: (Before mixing).",

But after its kneading, it no longer remains capable of being measured by volume, nor is it called volume-measured (Makyul), even if its origin was volume-measured, but rather it is weighed. So if it becomes weighed, it is not permissible to exchange one for the other on credit; because it is selling a weighed item for a weighed item on credit. And if the truth becomes apparent, it must be followed (2). Perhaps the Fatwa of our Sheikh Al-Shuwayki (3), and Ahmed bin Yahya (4), regarding that are interpreted based on this (5).",

So the author interpreted it based on the difference of the state, and the reality of his opinion is preferring the view of Ibn Atwa over the view of Al-Shuwayki, may Allah the Almighty have mercy on them.\n3.

He is: The scholar Sheikh Ahmed bin Yahya bin Atwa bin Zaid Al-Tamimi Al-Hanbali, died in the year 948 AH and was buried in Al-Jubaylah. See: Unwan Al-Majd by Ibn Bishr p. 10.\n5. Meaning the difference between the two Sheikhs is interpreted based on the difference of the state. Al-Shuwayki's prohibition of weighing Ajwa is before its kneading and mixing, so it remains volume-measured, and thus there is no Riba in selling it for meat. As for Ibn Atwa, he validates weight in Ajwa, the place of which is after kneading and mixing, so the dates become weighed at that point, so Riba applies to it with meat.",

"foot_note": "1. Sheikh Uthman Ibn Bishr said in (Unwan Al-Majd p. 10): (A conflict and quarrel occurred between Ibn Atwa and Al-Shuwayki, and Ibn Atwa authored a work refuting him in his Fatwa that kneaded dates if kneaded do not leave the rationale (Illah) of volume-measure. Likewise, something similar occurred between him and Abdullah bin Rahma, so Sheikh Ibn Atwa refuted him... And his refutation in that was recorded by Judge Ibn al-Qadi Ali bin Zaid the Judge of Ajwad bin Zamil the ruler of Al-Ahsa, and Judge Abdul Qadir bin Yazid Al-Musharrafi, and Judge Mansour bin Musbih Al-Bahili, and Abdul Rahman bin Musbih Al-Bahili, and Abdul Rahman bin Musbih, and Judge Ahmed bin Fayrouz bin Bassam, and Sultan bin Rayyis bin Mughamis, and all of these were in the time of Ajwad bin Zamil Al-Amiri Al-Uqayli the King of Al-Ahsa). Sheikh Abdullah Ibn Bassam indicated in (Ulama Najd 1/449) in the biography of Ibn Atwa, this Fatwa saying: (And a debate took place between the subject and his colleague Sheikh Ahmed Al-Shuwayki Al-Nabulsi—who was his peer under their Sheikh: Ahmed Al-Askari—, just as a similar one occurred between him and Sheikh Abdullah bin Rahma Al-Nasiri, regarding kneaded dates, do they remain on their original standard as volume-measured or does their standard become weight? The subject supported the second view, and they opposed him in that, and the debate intensified between him and them, so he authored a refutation against them regarding that).\n2. The text of Sheikh Ahmed bin Yahya Ibn Atwa's words is: (If it is said: It follows from your saying the permissibility of selling kneaded dates for wheat and the like of volume-measured items on credit; due to the difference of the rationale (Illah). I said: It implies analogy in appearance. But the verification: is the prevention of analogy; due to the lack of unity of the two rationales; for the rationale with which selling two genuses one for the other is prohibited is the original rationale, not the incidental rationale. And because it blocks the means to Riba, for selling volume-measured dates for volume-measured items on credit is prohibited by agreement, so the one who wants that can remove dates from their attribute by kneading, to arrive by that to other than its place, and to his corrupt intent of Riba; and because a thing is not sold for what shared its origin on credit). See: Al-Fawakih Al-Adida 1/250, Mulakhkhas Al-Fawakih Al-Adida 1/158. There are some phrases I corrected from the Summary (Mulakhkhas).\n3. Likewise Sheikh Shihab Ahmed Al-Askari Al-Hanbali (Died 910 AH) agreed with his student Sheikh Ibn Atwa. In questions asked to him by Ahmed bin Yahya bin Atwa (f. 6), Al-Askari said: (It follows from dates being kneaded that Riba applies; due to the unity of the rationale of the price and the priced item, which is weight. And the transfer of dates from volume-measure by kneading them is something on which there is no disagreement among any of the scholars, nay nor any of the rational people).",
