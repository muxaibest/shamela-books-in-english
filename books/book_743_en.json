    "text": "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. O Lord, complete this with Your grace and generosity.\n\nAfter praising God, who opened the lights of wisdom in the gardens of flourishing minds, clarified the secrets of words in the gardens of observant thoughts, preserved the system of eloquence in every time and era, and confined the types of rhetoric into the two categories of poetry and prose. And He sent His Prophet and chosen one, Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, with the eloquence of tongue and expression, and wisdom of clear proof, distinguished by beautiful delivery and clarification. May He purify his family and support his companions, the possessors of bright faces and eloquent tongues.\n\nI had previously compiled a book containing the delicate poems of the moderns regarding erotic poetry, containing the best of what their thoughts allowed in terms of spinning and flirtation. I named it 'Al-Nuzha Al-Sa'diyya fi Al-Ash'ar Al-Arabiyya' (The Sa'di Excursion in Arabic Poems), embroidered with the name of he who has settled in the highest peak of glory, and whose steed of virtue and generosity outpaced the preceding steeds. The nights shine with his lights, and fates bow before his awesomeness. He has given noble deeds their highest place... He is the Great Companion, the Served Master, the wielder of the sword and the pen, the holder of the reins of nations, the refuge of the sons of Adam, the Asaf of the time, the master of the Divan of Kingdoms in the East and West, the Sultan of Ministers far and near, Sa'd (Joy) of the Truth, the World, and Religion, the support of Kings and Sultans, the refuge of scholars in the worlds... [Dedication continues praising the patron Sa'd al-Din].\n\nThe group approached to memorize, study, research, and read it, so they requested that I compile a collection containing the subtleties of the poetry of the ancients, and the rare verses of the Pre-Islamic and Mukhadram poets, in various arts. I saw that fulfilling what they proposed was most appropriate. So I proceeded to select what is precious in meaning, brilliant in wording and content, chosen in casting, straight in construction, beautiful in opening, and good in closing. It serves as material for the writer and the poet, guaranteeing to sharpen the mind and clear the thoughts. I selected from the three Hamasahs available to me: The Hamasah of Abu Tammam Habib bin Aws Al-Tai, the Hamasah of Abu Hilal Al-Hasan bin Abdullah bin Sahl, and the Hamasah of Sheikh Ahmad bin Faris, may God have mercy on them. I added to them delicate poems of the moderns and rare verses of the later poets at the end of each chapter, following the path of brevity without prolixity. I also added other chapters on types of poetry needed in correspondence, messages, and dialogues that are not in these Hamasahs. Thus, this selection came with gentle purposes, pure sources and resources, free from strange words, cleared of wild expressions, combining Bedouin strength with the delicacy of civilization, like a wild tree in hardness and a garden tree in freshness.\n\nI presented it to his noble library... and named it 'Al-Tadhkirah Al-Sa'diyya fi Al-Ash'ar Al-Arabiyya' (The Sa'di Memorandum on Arabic Poems)... I arranged it into fourteen chapters:\n1. On Enthusiasm and Pride (Hamasah).\n2. On Literature, Wisdom, and Proverbs.\n3. On Erotic Poetry (Nasib).\n4. On Praise, Asking, Soliciting Sympathy, and Demanding.\n5. On Elegies.\n6. On Satire.\n7. On Fraternal Matters (Ikhwaniyyat).\n8. On Congratulations.\n9. On Apologies.\n10. On Descriptions.\n11. On Admonition and Complaint of Time's Events and Patience.\n12. On Witticisms (Mulah).\n13. On Miscellaneous Things.\n14. On Supplication.",

    "text": "The Fourteenth Chapter: On Supplication.\n\nChapter One: Enthusiasm and Pride (Hamasah)\n\nSome of the Banu Qais bin Tha'labah said (and it is said to be by Bashama bin Hazn Al-Nahshali):\nWe greet you, O Salma, so greet us back / And if you offer drink to the noble people, offer it to us.\nAnd if you call upon the chiefs of the noble people / For a calamity or a noble deed one day, call upon us.\nWe, the Banu Nahshal, do not claim a father / Other than him, nor does he sell us for other sons.\nIf a goal is raced for one day for a noble deed / You will find the winners among us and the second-place runners.\nThe whiteness of our partings (hair), our cooking pots boil / We heal with our wealth the scars of our hands.\nWe hold our lives cheap on the day of fear / But if we were sold during peace, we would be expensive.\nWe are of a people whose ancestors were annihilated / By the call of the warriors: 'Where are the defenders?'\nIf there was one of us among a thousand, and they called out / 'Who is a knight?' they would think it meant him.\nWhen the warriors step aside lest they be reached / By the edge of the swords, we connect them with our hands.\nYou do not see them, even if their calamity is great / Weeping with those who weep over the dead.\nWe ride the hateful (war) at times, and it is relieved / From us by honor and swords that favor us.\n\nAl-Samaw'al bin Adiya the Jew said (and it is said to be by Abdul Malik bin Abdul Rahim Al-Harithi):\nIf a man’s honor is not sullied by baseness / Then every cloak he wears is beautiful.\nAnd if he does not carry himself through oppression / Then there is no way to good praise.\nShe criticizes us that our numbers are few / So I said to her: Indeed, the noble ones are few.\nThose whose remnants are like us have not diminished / Youths who aspire to heights and elders.\nIt does not harm us that we are few, while our neighbor / Is mighty, and the neighbor of the majority is humiliated.\nWe have a mountain where those we protect settle / Impregnable, it turns back the eye tired and dull.\nIts root is anchored under the soil and its clouds / Reach the stars; a branch unreachable and long.\nWe are a people who do not see killing as a disgrace / While (the tribes of) Amir and Salul see it as such.\nThe love of death brings our appointed times closer to us / While their hatred of it lengthens their times.\nNo master among us died a natural death in bed / Nor was a slain one of us left unavenged where he was killed.\nOur souls flow upon the edge of swords / And they do not flow upon other than swords.\nWe are pure, so we did not become murky, and our essence remained pure / Females who carried us well and stallions.\nWe ascended to the best of backs (steeds/lineage), and we descended / In time to the best of bellies.\nWe are like the rain cloud; there is no bluntness in our lineage / Nor is a miser counted among us.\nWe deny the words of people if we wish / But they do not deny the words when we speak.\nIf a master among us passes, a master rises / One who speaks what the noble say and does it.\nNo fire of ours was ever extinguished against a night visitor / Nor did a guest ever blame us.\nOur days (of battle) are famous among our enemy / They have known blazes and white markings (signs of fame).\nOur swords in every east and west / Have notches from striking the armored ones.\nAccustomed not to have their blades drawn / Then sheathed until a tribe is annihilated.\nAsk, if you are ignorant, about us and about them / For the knowledgeable and the ignorant are not equal.\nIndeed, the Banu al-Dayyan are the pole for their people / Their millstones turn around them and roam.\n\nA man from Bal'anbar bin Tamim, named Qurayt bin Aneef, said:\nIf I were from Mazin, my camels would not have been deemed permissible / By the sons of the foundling from Dhuhul bin Shayban.\nThen a rough group would have risen to my aid / At the moment of anger, even if the slow one softens.\nA people who, when evil bares its molars to them / Fly to it in groups and individuals.\nThey do not ask their brother, when he calls them / In calamities, for proof of what he says.\nBut my people, even if they are numerous / Are not involved in evil, even if it is light.\nThey repay oppression—is oppression forgiveness?— / And the evil of the evildoers with kindness.\nAs if your Lord did not create anyone / Among all people to fear Him except them.\nI wish I had, instead of them, a people who, when they ride / Launch a raid, as knights and riders.\n\nAl-Fand Al-Zamani said concerning the War of Basus (His name was Shahl bin Shayban):\nWe forgave the Banu Dhuhul / And we said the people are brothers.\nPerhaps the days might return / The people to how they used to be.\nBut when evil declared itself / And ended up naked (exposed).\nAnd nothing remained but aggression / We treated them as they treated us.\nWe walked the walk of the lion / Morning comes and the lion is angry.\nWith a striking in which there is weakening / Subjugation and binding.\nFor some ignorance, in the face of ignorance / Is submission to humiliation.",

Prepare for me a way forward / To death, plunging into the battalions.\nWhen he intends, he casts his resolve between his eyes / And throws aside the thought of consequences.\nHe did not consult anyone in his affair but himself / And was not pleased with any companion but the hilt of the sword.\n\nAbu Kabir Al-Hudhali said:\nI traveled in the darkness with a reckless determination / Tough among the youths, not heavy/sluggish.\nOf those whom women carried while they were tying / The knots of the belt, so he grew up without defect.\nCleared from every remnant of menstruation / And the corruption of a nursing woman and a suckling pregnant one.\nShe conceived him in a night of fear / Unwillingly, and the knot of her belt was not untied.\nShe brought him, wild of heart, lean-bellied / Awake when the night of the foolish sleeper sleeps.\nIf you look at the lines of his face / They flash like the lightning of the joyous cloud.\nDifficult in battle, his side cannot be violated / Sharp of resolve like the sharp cutting sword.\nHe protects the companions when there is a hateful battle / And when they dismount, he is the shelter of the poor.\n\nTa'abbata Sharran (his name was Thabit bin Jabir) said:\nIf a man does not use stratagems when his luck is serious / He loses and suffers his affair while retreating.\nBut the man of prudence is the one whom / Calamity does not befall unless he sees the way out.\nHe is the master of time as long as he lives; around him / If one nostril is blocked, another nostril flows (he finds a way).\nI say to Lihyan when their whistlers whistled / And my day was narrow, the stone enclosed / hindering.\nThey are two plans: either captivity and a favor (being spared) / Or blood, and killing is more fitting for the free man.\nAnd another (plan) I turn my soul towards, and it is / A source of prudence if I do it, and a resource.\nI spread my chest for it, so there slipped from the rock / A thick chest and a narrow waist.\nHe mixed with the soft earth, the rock did not scratch / Him a single scratch, and death stood looking in shame.\nSo I returned to Fahm, and I was not returning (expectedly) / And how many like it (perilous situations) I left while it whistled (empty).\n\nHe also said:\nI am sending my praise and intending / With it the son of the noble uncle, Shams bin Malik.\nLittle complaining about the important matter that befalls him / Much love, scattered in directions and paths.",

My thought of her is guarding my absence and tending... to what I asked to be tended, and opinion regarding the unseen is wide. Let no third party hear my secret and your secret... indeed, every secret that passes two is spread. As if my heart on the day of Shaqqayn was one who rebelled... in fear of the occurrence of separation, or it is [already] occurring. And perhaps the youth praises God for patience... and perhaps the gatherers will gather the scattered union. She said, while her eyes were overflowing with tears... 'May I be your ransom, explain to me when you are returning.' I said to her, 'By God, a traveler knows... if the earth conceals him, what God is doing.' So she tightened the veil over her mouth and turned away... and the tear ducts caused the crushed kohl to run. Qays al-Majnun said: Perhaps you will be quenched by a drink from the past... and be pleased with characters that have consequences. And test the connection of those who connect, so you know... the traits of one who purifies love and [one who] taints it. I encountered a surge of agonizing love... that has a creeping sensation between my flesh and bones. This soul has been worn out by the fact that there is no ceasing... of a sorrow for it; what is near is not attainable. Neither does the heart let go of wishes so it may heal... nor is the soul willing to give up what you know. You have God's [oath] that I am connecting what you connected of me... and praising what you bestowed upon me, and rewarding. And taking what you gave freely, and indeed I... turn away from what you dislike, fearful. So do not leave my soul scattered... for out of passion, it has almost melted over you. Another said: May the rain water the solitary mountain in whose shadows... are two kohl-eyed gazelles, united. I sought them as prey, but I could not [catch] them... and [I sought them] by stealth, but they escaped me and killed me. Another said: Verily, perhaps she deceived you during her address... and young maids generated the lying promise. Conversations drop from them fresh... the dropping of pearls surrendered by the necklaces. Umar bin Abi Rabi'ah said: And when she disputes with you in conversation, she takes the edge... of it briefly, and does not desire abundance. The listeners lean towards it for its beauty... as if they are being given wine to drink from it. Na'im al-Nabhani said: We remained for a day at Umm Muhallim's... intoxicated, though we did not drink thick juice or wine. If she fell silent before us, we sobered up at her silence... and if she spoke, it was drunkenness for our minds. Ibn al-Tathriyah said: She killed and revived, through refusal and wishes... a heart shot at, whose fatal spots were hit. And she possesses the enslavement of the soul from me when she nears... [with] scraps of conversation wherein its falsehood defeats the truth. Qays bin Dharih said: If they hide her, or if there stands between her union... the speech of a slanderer or the threat of an emir. They will not prevent my eyes from constant weeping... nor remove what my conscience has concealed. We were all together before passion appeared... in the most blissful state of envy and joy. But the slanderers did not cease until there appeared to us... the bellies of love turned over to be backs. I would have been sufficient for the soul had her union lasted... but the world is a possession of deception. Jamil said: As if there were no distance if there was... a meeting between us, but I do not imagine a meeting.",

    "text": "I became, from sighs I cannot bear / Complaining of sleep when others complain of insomnia.\n\nAbu Nuwas Al-Hasan bin Hani said:\nMay God water a deer showing coquetry in the enclosure / Swaying like the Ban branch from the thinness of the waist.\nIn his eyes is magic apparent in his eyelids / And in his scent is goodness like the fragrant perfume.\nHe is the full moon except that in him is saltiness (beauty) / With languor of glance that the sun and moon do not have.\nHe laughs revealing a salty mouth as if it is / Bubbles of wine or pure pearls.\nSweet are his front teeth and like wine is his saliva / And his cheek and the wine are in the delicacy of wine.\nHe shunned me without a crime I committed against him / And left me emaciated, empty of patience.\nMay God water days, when there was no abandonment between us / And the stick of youth shook in green leaves.\nAnd watering for days that passed while fresh / O would that they returned and lasted to the Resurrection.\nI went early to pleasures, tearing the veil / And the daughters of... led me to openness.\nI saw the nights lying in wait / ... racing time.\nI was content from the world with a cup and a fawn / ... intelligent of thought.\nHealthy, sick of eyelid, nearing, distancing / He kills and revives with connection and abandonment.\nAs if the light of the sun... / ... between the collarbones and the waist.\nWhenever... appeared / The image of the full moon rises from it.\n\nHe also said:\nI say to her: You were stingy... / So be generous in sleep to a fond lover.\nShe said: No. And you became sleeping too? / And hoping that I visit you in sleep?\n\nHe also said:\nO moon of the night when it darkened / Does the greeting decrease him who greets?\nYou were possessing connection, so who is he who / Taught you abandonment? No, he did not know.\nIf you are unjust to me among people / I am content that you remain and be unjust.\n\nHe also said:\nAnd a girl having the form of beauties / Young of age in the dress of a boy.\nI say to her when the drinking companions slept / Return my fond heart.\nShe said: Who? I said... / She said: When did you enter yourself into...?\nI said to her: You overcame my heart / When you showed Dal and Lam (coquetry/hair).\nShe said to me: You slept? You saw good / I see you saw this in sleep.\n\nHe also said:\nJinan insults me, she mentioned / And claims that I am a flatterer, malicious.\nAnd that my affection is a lie and falsehood / And that I am for whom I love, a breaker (of promises).\nIt is not so, nor a rejection to her / But the bored one is the breaker.\nI have a heart struggling towards her / And a longing between my ribs, urging.\nShe saw my fondness for her and the permanence of my ecstasy / So she got bored of me; thus was the hadith.\n\nHe also said:\nA tender, soft, heavy-hipped girl / My heart wandered with her love.\nHer figure is the best figure / Ask who saw her.\nGod did not create her except / As a temptation when He created her.\nShe scatters pearls when she sings / Upon us, her lips.\nYou see pride for the Oud / When her hands hold it.\nShe is my worry and my wish / I wish I were her wish.\n\nHe also said:\nNews came to me of an insult from you to me, so my insult / Is it not that my name ran in your mouth? Then feel (or enough).\nSo say what appears to you to say / For what is it all but for my imprisonment.\n\nHe also said:\nIt is hard on me that you find like my ecstasy / Because love, the easiest of it is severe.\nI saw love as fires blazing / Hearts of lovers are fuel for them.\nI wish if they burned, they would perish / But whenever they burn, they return.\nLike the people of Fire; if skins are cooked / Skins are returned to them for misery.\n\nHe also said:\nWhat is with me and people? How much they blame me foolishly / My religion is for myself and the religion of people is for people.\nGod knows that my leaving your visit / Is only for fear of my enemies and guards.\nIf I were able to come, I would come to you / Dragging on the face, not walking on the head.\n\nHe also said:\nMy ransom for you! I have no turning away from you / Nor do I have justice from you in love.\nYour connection to me is the purified honey / And your abandonment to me is the instant poison.\nI circumambulate your palace every day / As if the circumambulation was created for your palace.\nWere it not for your love, I would have stuck to my house / For in my house I have the flowing wine.\n\nHe also said:\nO he for whom speech is not desired / How then, other than speech, is desired?\nNor greeting except from afar / So the peace includes me with the people.\nI love blame regarding her only / To hear them mention her name in what I am blamed for.",
