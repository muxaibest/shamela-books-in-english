    "text": "Introduction. Indeed, all praise is due to Allah, we praise Him, we seek His help, we ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our own selves and our bad deeds. Whomever Allah guides, there is none to misguide him, and whomever He leaves astray, there is none to guide him. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, having no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger. As for what follows: In the year 1373 AH, I came across an inquiry (Fatwa request) in the magazine 'Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimun' (The Muslim Brotherhood) of Egypt, Issue 11, dated 29 Dhu al-Qi'dah of the mentioned year, about music and singing. Its text was: 'I am a young Muslim man who performs the rituals of religion and am very sincere, but there is something that dominates my soul, which is the love of music and singing, despite the fact that I memorize the Noble Quran. Is this hobby forbidden (Haram)?' The virtuous Professor Sheikh Muhammad Abu Zahra answered with the following text: 'Regarding singing, if it does not contain what arouses the sexual instinct, we do not find a reason to prohibit it. The Arabs used to recite Rajaz poetry, sing, and beat the daff (tambourine). It was reported in some narrations the invitation to beat the daff in marriage. It was said: The distinction between the lawful (Halal) and the prohibited (Haram) is the daff. And music is like that. We find that when Persian singing with melodies entered during the era of the Tabi'in (Successors), they were two groups:",

    "text": "A group inclined towards listening and did not find anything in it that touches religion, like Al-Hasan Al-Basri. And a group did not incline towards it and found it contrary to asceticism and piety, like Al-Sha'bi. In any case, it is agreed upon that as long as it does not arouse the sexual instinct and does not distract from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer, then there is nothing in it that touches religion.' I say: At that time, I wrote a response to this Fatwa due to its contradiction with the authentic Hadiths and the Madhhab of the majority of scholars, and I sent it to the magazine. But it seems that the suspension of the magazine during the era of Abdel Nasser and preventing it from issuing prevented its publication. In this Fatwa, despite its brevity, there are various errors and delusions that I did not imagine the Sheikh was too great to fall into. So I must clarify them with brevity as much as possible, except for what has a complete connection to the subject of the treatise. So I say: Songs and Music: 1- The reason for prohibiting singing is the authentic Hadiths established in the books of Sunnah, as will be explained, extracted and authenticated by scholars in this treatise. Does the Sheikh, who is among the senior scholars of Al-Azhar, ignore them or does he disregard them like some of his students as will come? Both are bitter. 2- The condition he legislated from himself: 'that it does not arouse the sexual instinct', and some of his students like Sheikh Al-Qaradawi and Al-Ghazali and others imitated him in it. The first one said, as will be quoted from him in this introduction, explicitly: 'And there is no harm if it is accompanied by non-arousing music',",

    "text": "meaning singing. So I say: This condition is theoretical, not practical, and cannot be regulated because what arouses the instinct differs according to temperaments: masculinity and femininity, old age and youth, heat and coldness, as is not hidden from the intelligent person. By Allah, I am extremely amazed at the succession of these Azhari Sheikhs on this theoretical condition. For despite their contradiction with authentic Hadiths and their opposition to the Madhhabs of the four Imams and the sayings of the Salaf, they fabricate reasons from themselves which none of the followed Imams said. Among its effects is permitting what is forbidden of singing and music according to them as well. Let us strike an example of that: One of them might have a wife, sons, and daughters, like Sheikh Al-Ghazali for example, who declares and perhaps boasts that he listens to Umm Kulthum and Muhammad Abdel Wahhab the musician and their likes, so his children see him, and perhaps even his students as he narrated in some of his writings. Can these people distinguish with their knowledge and adolescence between arousing music so they deafen their ears from it, or will they continue listening to it? By Allah, it is a Fiqh that does not issue except from a rigid hateful Zahiri (Literalist) or a person of desire who is not guided. This reminded me of the differentiation of the Hanafi Madhhab between wine (Khamr) made from grapes, which is all forbidden, no difference between little and much, and wine made from other than grapes like dates and the like, so only the large intoxicating amount is forbidden according to them (1). As for how to practically differentiate between the small non-intoxicating amount in it and the large intoxicating amount, and if",

    "text": "that is possible, then when? Before consuming it? Or after he gets drunk? This is among what they remained silent about and left the matter to the drinker, just as the referred Sheikhs did regarding the differentiation between forbidden arousing music and permissible non-arousing music. Does one say this who believes in the likes of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"And whoever roams around the sanctuary (Hima) is likely to fall into it.\" And his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Leave what makes you doubt for what does not make you doubt,\" to other texts of the Book and Sunnah upon which the rule of 'Sadd al-Dhari'ah' (Blocking the Means) was established, which is considered from the perfection of Sharia and which Sheikh Al-Qaradawi himself praised in the introduction of his book 'The Lawful and the Prohibited'? And Ibn al-Qayyim struck dozens of examples for it from the Book and Sunnah, so refer to it for it is important (1). Worse than this differentiation and that is what I had read in a bulletin of a well-known Islamic party that it is permissible for a man to kiss a foreign woman (Ajnabiyyah) when greeting her, not just shaking her hand but kissing her too. They said: But with a good intention and without desire. So all of these turned away from applying that great rule supported by dozens of proofs, along with their turning away from general proofs as is not hidden. Rather, they contradicted another example not mentioned by Ibn al-Qayyim which contains a refutation against them in the Sahih; these ones in their permission of kissing and shaking hands with foreign women, and those ones in listening to their songs like Al-Ghazali with Umm Kulthum. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, considered that a type of Zina (adultery), for he said: \"Written upon the son of Adam is his share of Zina, he will inevitably catch that: The eyes, their Zina is looking.",

I say: Thus it becomes clear from what preceded the invalidity of the restriction of Sheikh Abu Zahra and those who imitated him regarding forbidden music and singing to what arouses the sexual instinct, and that the correct view is the prohibition of that absolutely due to the generality of the coming Hadiths and due to the rule of Blocking the Means. Similar to it in invalidity is what follows. 3- His saying: \"And the Arabs used to recite Rajaz poetry, sing, and beat the daff.\" I say: This is false from several aspects which will be explained. It is clear that he means by \"Arabs\" the Salaf (Predecessors), and in that case, his expression about them with this term is a modern Jaahili nationalistic expression which is very strange to be issued from an Azhari Sheikh!

Otherwise, where is he from the saying of Ibn Masud, may Allah be pleased with him: Singing sprouts hypocrisy in the heart. It was narrated as Marfu' (attributed) to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, but the correct view is that it is Mawquf (stopped at the Companion) as Ibn al-Qayyim said in Ighathat Al-Lahfan 1/248, and therefore I extracted it in Al-Da'ifah 430. And from the saying of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him: The daff is Haram and musical instruments are Haram, and it will come on p. 92.

To other than that which is mentioned in its place, and see p. 102-103. Third: That those who used to beat the daff were women not men, and on the occasion of marriage, and regarding that are Hadiths I had mentioned in my book Adab Al-Zafaf p. 179-183, or on the occasion of Eid as in the Hadith of Aisha coming at the end of this treatise.

And worse than it is his saying following it: \"It was said: The distinction between the lawful and the prohibited is the daff.\" For \"It was said\" (Qila) is from the passive forms of weakness (Tamridh) according to scholars, and it is only said regarding human speech, while this is a well-known Prophetic Hadith. If he intends by his mentioned saying to weaken it, he has erred twice, in narration and terminology. As for narration, the Hadith is Hasan (Good) as Al-Tirmidhi said, and Al-Hakim and Al-Dhahabi authenticated it, and it is extracted in the previously mentioned source and in Al-Irwa 7/50-51. As for terminology, it is only said regarding weak Hadith: \"It was narrated\" (Ruwiya) and not \"It was said\" (Qila). And there is another error which is his saying in the Hadith: \"Farq\" (Difference/Distinction), while according to them it is with the wording: \"Fasl\" (Separation/Decision). So contemplate how much ignorance of Hadith and its terminology is in the speech of this Azhari Sheikh. So it is no wonder that from his student Al-Ghazali comes what is more amazing and strange as will come. This matter indicates that Al-Azhar did not have care for teaching Hadith in terms of understanding (Dirayah) and narration (Riwayah). The greatest proof for that is that we do not see in this era a known famous Muhaddith with his works and writings who graduated from the noble Al-Azhar. And sufficient proof for what I say is this feeble speech from this senior Sheikh of theirs. And Allah is the One sought for help. 5- His saying: \"And music is like that.\" I say: This is an analogy (Qiyas), and it indicates",

He made forbidden singing a purely matter of taste like all permissible things such as food and drink; whoever wishes does it and whoever wishes leaves it. He was not satisfied with this, but attributed to the Salaf what contradicts what is established from them. Al-Hasan Al-Basri is innocent of what was attributed to him. Ibn Abi Al-Dunya narrated in Dhamm Al-Malahi (Condemnation of Instruments of Diversion) number 62 and 63 of my copy with two chains from him that he said: \"Two cursed voices: A flute (Mizmar) at a grace and a wail at a calamity.\" This has been authenticated as Marfu' to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, as will come in the treatise, Allah willing: The second Hadith p. 51.

Among them was a treatise on distracting singing: Is it permissible or prohibited? In it, he argued for the permissibility of singing and musical instruments of various kinds. I imagined the extent of the bad effect this treatise would have on the hearts of its readers from the elite and students of knowledge, let alone the general public, due to two matters: First: Ibn Hazm's scientific fame in the Islamic world, even though he is of the Zahiri (Literalist) Madhhab and does not accept analogy (Qiyas), contrary to the four Imams and others. The Other: The dominance of desire over most people. If they see such an Imam arguing for the permissibility of what agrees with their desires, nothing will stop them after that from following their desires. Rather, they might find in what they hear from some Sheikhs justification for imitating him, like their saying: \"Whoever imitates a scholar meets Allah safely.\" Some of them imagine it to be a Hadith, but it has no basis (1), even though Ibn Hazm, may Allah have mercy on him, forbids imitation (Taqlid) and prohibits it severely. Added to that is the scarcity of sincere scholars who remind people of the correct ruling in this issue and the authentic Hadiths reported in it, and the abundance of what is written and broadcast contradicting them. So they imagine that what Ibn Hazm said is correct, especially as they read Fatwas by some contemporary scholars supporting his view, published in some circulated Islamic magazines",

It is an expression of emotions and feelings reflected from nature or humans. The largest number of skilled players with the latest various instruments are gathered for it so that the expression is as close to reality as possible. Egyptian Symphony bands have been formed comprising more than thirty players, assisted by the Young Men's Christian Association, and they played at the American University.

The affliction and fascination with songs and music has increased due to the availability of listening means like radios, recorders, television, and broadcasts, and the silence of many scholars from denouncing it, rather the declaration of its permissibility by some of them whom many think are senior scholars. Articles published in some newspapers and magazines permitting musical instruments, denying their prohibition, and weakening the Hadiths reported about them have multiplied and diversified, throwing against the wall the (opinions of) Huffaz who authenticated them and the Madhhabs of Imams who held their meanings, not addressing mentioning them so that the general readers imagine they have no existence. Or (these articles are) from obscure writers who are neither in the caravan nor in the troop (of no significance), as is said. Examples are many and very many. Suffice me now one example published in the Jordanian newspaper Al-Ribat, Issue 9-15, June 1993. It contained three articles permitting it by three of them. The most dangerous and worst of them is the article of the so-called Hassan Abdel Mannan, for he set himself up as an investigator to refute the Muhadditheen who authenticated the Hadith of Al-Bukhari coming regarding the prohibition of musical instruments through twisted ways and claiming false defects not",

If an authentic Hadith clashes with his opinion, he destroys it with a false claim from his many claims. For example, he says: 'So-and-so weakened it', while knowing that others more knowledgeable or numerous than him authenticated it, as is his stance on the Hadith of Al-Bukhari coming regarding musical instruments. Sometimes he rejects it claiming it is a solitary Hadith (Ahad), knowing also that the solitary report is proof in jurisprudential and practical matters by agreement. If he cannot reject it for one reason or another, he rejects acting upon it by saying: 'It is not definitive in indication (Qat'i al-Dalalah)', knowing also that this is not a condition according to scholars, but rather preponderant belief (Zann Rajih) suffices in it. Otherwise, we would turn his claim against him and reject all his oppositions because they were not built with certainty on evidence definitive in establishment and definitive in indication, otherwise there would be no disagreement. If the Hadith is in practical matters and unseen matters, he rejects it saying: 'It does not relate to creed nor is action linked to it'. Or he might fabricate a meaning for it from his own thought which is inherently false and stick it to the Hadith while it is innocent of it. As for the speech of scholars in defending the Hadith and interpreting it with knowledge, he looks down upon it and rejects it, attacking them with what he is worthy of and more deserving, like his saying p. 29: \"We say: All this defense is light in weight, and it is a trivial defense that is not palatable.\" He opposes with this the scholars, namely the commentators of Hadith: Al-Maziri, Qadi Iyad, and Al-Nawawi, from whom he quoted the referred speech.

As for the Hadith mentioned by some contemporary writers like Al-Mawdudi, may Allah have mercy on him, imitating his Hanafi Madhhab, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, killed a Muslim for a Dhimmi, it is Munkar (denounced) and not authentic as said by some Imams. I have spoken about it in Silsilat Al-Ahadith Al-Da'ifah number 460 in detail. Then I ask, I and every fair-minded intelligent person: Why did Sheikh Al-Ghazali waste acting upon this authentic Hadith which agrees with the generality of His saying, Exalted is He: {Then should We treat the Muslims like the criminals? What is [the matter] with you? How do you judge?} Even if it was cited in a different context. For Al-Ghazali is eager to hold onto the generality of the Quran even if it is specified by Prophetic Hadiths. Examples of that are many, among them what preceded recently of his denial against all scholars, Muhadditheen and Fuqaha, making the blood money of a woman half that of a man, and attributing them to opposing the apparent meaning of the Book, meaning His saying, Exalted is He: {The soul for the soul}. Fourth: Contemplate with me, O noble reader, the kindness of Sheikh Al-Ghazali with the enemies of Allah: the Jews and Christians, by his saying: 'our opponents in religion', and he might say about them sometimes: 'our brothers'. Compare that with his numerous stances towards his brothers in religion, how he is harsh against their scholars, the dead among them and the living, and especially the students of knowledge among them. Some examples of what he said about the People of Hadith and its commentators have passed by you recently. I wonder, is that from what he deposited in his book 'The Character of the Muslim'? Or is it an explicit violation of the likes of His saying, Exalted is He: {Humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers}?

Those are a few samples of Sheikh Al-Ghazali's many stances towards authentic Prophetic Hadiths and weak Hadiths. He takes from them what he wishes and rejects what contradicts his desire without relying in that on a rule mentioned by any of the scholars. Rather, it is blind randomness as preceded. I mentioned that so readers realize his method in rejecting authentic Hadiths according to specialist scholars. He is not of them in knowledge so he can distinguish the authentic from the weak proceeding from their rules - and his book Fiqh Al-Sirah with my Takhrij of it and the preceding examples are decisive proof of that. Nor is he with them as Allah the Exalted said: {And be with the truthful}. And He said: {So ask the people of the message if you do not know}. And his introduction to my referred Takhrij and the previous examples also confirm all that. So whoever is not of those scholars nor with them, it is more appropriate that his state of affairs - at least - be as that Jaahili poet said: 'And am I but from Ghaziyyah? If she errs... I err, and if Ghaziyyah is guided I am guided.' The conclusion of that is his stance on the Hadith of Al-Bukhari regarding musical instruments and his style in weakening it. This alone is sufficient to indicate that he does not proceed in his criticism of Hadiths except from desire and blind conjecture. He said: p. 66-67, to one of the scholars of the Gulf while discussing with him the night of the middle of Sha'ban: \"I think the Hadiths reported regarding the night of the middle are stronger than the Hadiths reported regarding the prohibition of singing.\"",

And if the intended meaning is the Hadith of forgiveness for all creation except those excepted in it, then it is also a single Hadith that came via paths from a group of Companions with different wordings, none of which is free from a defect. Therefore, most scholars weakened it as Ibn Rajab said. And Ibn Hibban authenticated one of them, but it has discontinuity. So it is possible to authenticate it or at least deem it Hasan due to those paths. For their sake, I extracted it in Al-Silsilah Al-Sahihah 1144 and made it part of my new book Sahih Mawarid Al-Zam'an.../1980, which is under print.

Perhaps that scholar made him understand that this is not from the methods of scholars, but rather it is the method of ignorant imitators who argue with the sayings of scholars even if they contradict the Book and Sunnah. The scholar is only the one who counters argument with argument. So if you are satisfied for yourself with arguing by Ibn Hazm, then what do you say about the scholars of Islam from Muhadditheen and Fuqaha who refuted Ibn Hazm's weakening of Al-Bukhari's Hadith and others, like Ibn al-Salah, Al-Nawawi, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn al-Qayyim, and others as will come? If this were said to him, he would refuse and become arrogant and say: 'A goat even if it flew.' The intention now is to clarify what is in the man's quotation from Ibn Hazm. He blackened three pages in which he cited ten Hadiths, the last of them the Hadith of Al-Bukhari which Ibn Hazm defected with two defects: Discontinuity and the narrator's hesitation in the name of the Companion as will come. He did not mention this one, and mentioned instead his saying: \"And the Mu'allaqat (suspended narrations) of Al-Bukhari are accepted because they are mostly connected chains, but Ibn Hazm says: The chain here is disconnected, what is between Al-Bukhari and Sadaqah bin Khalid the narrator of the Hadith is not connected.\"",

    "text": "My purpose now is not to refute Ibn Hazm, for it is a connected chain and the refutation against him is coming. Rather, (my purpose is) to clarify the ignorance of this transmitter from Ibn Hazm. So I say: First: His saying: \"And the Mu'allaqat of Al-Bukhari are accepted...\" contains error and deception (Tadlis). As for the error, it is because acceptance is not absolute in the science of terminology - which has no value to him at all unless it agrees with opinion or desire. Rather, that is if the suspension (Ta'liq) is in the decisive form (Sighat al-Jazm) like 'He narrated' (Rawa), 'From' ('An), and 'He said' (Qala) as in this Hadith, with detail to be mentioned in its place in this treatise, Allah willing, p. 39/40 and 82/85 of the third chapter. As for the deception, it is his saying: \"are accepted\" (Yu'khadhu biha) in the passive voice, meaning by others. As for him, he did not say: \"We accept them,\" because he might not accept them as he did here. How not, when he often does not accept what Al-Bukhari narrated with a connected chain even if Muslim and the rest of the Six, rather the sixty Imams, were with him? Some examples have passed. Second: He is ignorant that Hisham bin Ammar is among the Sheikhs of Al-Bukhari. So his saying: \"Hisham bin Ammar said...\" is not a suspension (Ta'liq), rather it is connected, because there is no difference for Al-Bukhari between his saying: \"Hisham said\" or: \"Hisham told me\" as will be explained in the third chapter referred to just now, and with strong words by Ibn Hazm himself as well. Third: He did not notice - and it is fitting for him - the error of Ibn Hazm in his saying: \"What is between Al-Bukhari and Sadaqah is not connected,\" for the claimed discontinuity is only between Al-Bukhari and Hisham, because",

Fourth: And it is more appropriate that he does not notice Ibn Hazm's exaggeration and severity in rejecting what he does not know of the Hadith of his Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. There is no strangeness in that, for birds of a feather flock together. He has the fullest share of what was said about him: \"The tongue of Ibn Hazm and the sword of Al-Hajjaj are siblings.\" I mean what Ibn Hazm said regarding the eighth Hadith which Al-Ghazali quoted from him: \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade two cursed voices: the voice of a wailing woman and the voice of a singing woman.\" Ibn Hazm said about it: \"We do not know a path for it, and this is nothing.\" And in Al-Ghazali's quotation from him p. 69: \"And its chain is nothing.\" Ibn Hazm's saying: \"And this is nothing\" is from his severity and hair-splitting. For scholars say regarding what they did not find a path or chain for: \"We do not know a basis for it,\" or with exaggeration: \"It has no basis,\" as some early Huffaz say like Al-Uqayli. The first is correct, especially for one who is not among the Huffaz of Hadith and specialists in it like Ibn Hazm. That is obligatory on the likes of him and his imitators like Al-Ghazali, fearing they fall into denying a Hadith said by the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, for it is no less sinful than lying against the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. Allah said regarding the polytheists: {Rather, they have denied that which they have not encompassed with its knowledge}. For the mentioned Hadith has two chains from the Hadith of Abdur-Rahman bin Awf and Anas bin Malik, extracted by a group of famous Huffaz as comes in its place in the treatise. Among them are Al-Tayalisi and Al-Bazzar, and they are among the Huffaz known to Ibn Hazm and whom he praised their Musnads as quoted",

I do not want to say: He is like the ostrich with the hunter. Fifth: Al-Ghazali did not quench his thirst in rejecting the Hadith with Ibn Hazm's previous saying: \"And this is nothing,\" but rather distorted it and said: \"And its chain is nothing\" as preceded. This is from his extreme ignorance of this science or severe heedlessness due to the dominance of desire over him. Of old it was said: \"Your love for a thing blinds and deafens.\" That is because this distorted saying does not harmonize with Ibn Hazm's saying: \"We do not know a path for it,\" since it is not valid in a human mind to combine this absolute negation of the path, which is the chain, and affirming the chain even with indicating its weakness by his saying: \"And its chain is nothing,\" all in one place. So know yourself, O Sheikh, you will know your Lord. And discipline yourself with the discipline of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him: \"He is not of us who does not honor our elder, have mercy on our young, and acknowledge the right of our scholar.\" Al-Ta'liq Al-Raghib 1/66. So know, O Sheikh, while you are on the edge of your grave, the worth of the scholars of Hadith and Sunnah and the Fuqaha of this Ummah. Do not deviate from them a hair's breadth, deceived by your argumentation, pen, and writing. Our Prophet, blessings and peace of Allah be upon him, says: \"The most hated of men to Allah is the quarrelsome opponent.\" Agreed upon. And you know with certainty that material life, let alone religious life, does not straighten in a society if its individuals do not rely in every science on the specialists among them. There is no need to strike examples for that, for the matter is very self-evident. For example, one who wants to know the authenticity of a Hadith or its Fiqh does not refer to a writer or",

As was said: \"And if you do not see the moon rising... then submit to people who saw it with eyes.\" Neither are you of them - and I do not think arrogance or stubbornness reaches with you to deny that - nor have you submitted to them. Rather, you set yourself up to refute them with mockery of their sayings and ridicule of them, as if you did not know or knew but did not believe in the likes of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Arrogance is rejecting the truth and looking down on people.\" Al-Sahihah 134 and 1626.

I have clarified his ignorance in that and his denial and reversing of facts in detail in the rectifications (Istidrakat) at the end of the first volume of the new edition of Silsilat Al-Ahadith Al-Sahihah.

O Sheikh, perhaps this aggressor against authentic Hadiths and his likes are a fruit of your bitter fruits in your attacking the authentic Sunnah and its Imams and not regarding their sayings in authentication and weakening (1), until scientific chaos spread and struck its tents among the ranks of the Ummah and its youth. Each one of them began authenticating and weakening according to what he desires and fancies. So repent to Allah, Blessed and Exalted, from this bad Sunnah and its likes, otherwise its burden and the burden of those who followed you on it will be upon you. And ask Him, Exalted is He, for a good ending.

The Imam cited in it the Hadiths prohibiting singing and musical instruments, which are more than ten, and weakened all of them. Then he concluded by saying after them on p. 97: \"So if nothing authentic has been established in this at all, Allah the Exalted has said: {He has explained in detail to you what He has forbidden you}, and the Exalted said: {It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth}, and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: via the path of Sa'd bin [Abi] (1) Waqqas, and its path is established: 'Indeed, the greatest of Muslims in crime against Muslims is he who asks about a thing that was not prohibited, then it becomes prohibited because of his asking' (2). So it is correct that everything the Exalted has prohibited for us, He has detailed for us, and what He has not detailed its prohibition for us is lawful.\" I say: This result, a scholar has no choice but to submit to it if the premise was correct, which is his weakening of all the prohibition Hadiths.

This is by virtue of the rule agreed upon by Muhadditheen and scholars: That the weak Hadith is strengthened by the multiplicity of paths, as detailed in the science of Hadith terminology. With it, Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar and others strengthened the Hadith \"The ears are part of the head\" in his valuable book 'Al-Nukat ala Ibn al-Salah'. He cited it therein from four Companions and clarified their defects 1/410-415, then concluded by saying: \"If the fair person looks at the sum of these paths, he will know that the Hadith has a basis and it is not something to be discarded.

I found it a valuable book collecting the Hadiths and Athar of this chapter, a collection not preceded to my knowledge, with scientific Hadith criticism for every individual one of them, a matter rarely found even in early books of Takhrij, while adhering to the rules of this noble science. Sufficient proof for the reader of what I mentioned is that the total of his Hadiths and Athar is nearly a hundred: 8 are authentic Hadiths, 70 are weak Hadiths most of which are severely weak, and 18 are Mawquf Athar some of which are authentic. Thus, the virtuous brother has undertaken what I had decided regarding speaking on all the Hadiths of the chapter and more, so may Allah reward him with good. However, I wished he had been precise in weakening them and had mixed the Hadiths of permissibility with the Hadiths of prohibition to facilitate for the readers understanding them and distinguishing these from those, especially since he did not speak on them from the Fiqh perspective nor clarify their indications, like the Hadith of Aisha and Ibn Umar which Ibn Hazm used as evidence for permissibility.

Especially since he said at the end of his extraction: \"And I had deemed his Hadith Hasan before\" meaning the Hadith of Shabib from Anas \"before I contemplated his condition, being deceived by the saying of some people of knowledge.\" I say: At least he should deem it Hasan due to its mentioned witness if he does not authenticate it; rather, it is obligatory on him after he mentioned a trustworthy follower from Anas, and Al-Bukhari used him as proof. Even if the one referred to accused him of Tadlis following Ibn Hibban, Al-Hafiz rejected it, and a group of Huffaz strengthened the Hadith as you will see there.

He missed at its end: Hajjaj, one of its narrators, said: Al-Zammarah: The fornicatress (Zaniyah). I say: This prevents including it in the group of singing Hadiths, even if the word Zammarah linguistically allows it, for it is the feminine of Zammar, the player of Mizmar (flute). Although I notice a strong connection between the fornicatress and Zamr (flute playing), therefore it was said: Singing is the charm of Zina, but it is not necessary (to be the meaning here), and Allah knows best.

The completion of his speech will come, Allah willing, in Chapter Three. The intention is that the Hadith is not disconnected between Al-Bukhari and his Sheikh Hisham as Ibn Hazm claimed, and those who imitated him from the contemporaries, as will be explained in the mentioned chapter, Allah the Exalted willing. Even if it were assumed to be disconnected, it is a relative defect that is not permissible to cling to, because it has come connected (Mawsul) from paths of a group of trustworthy Huffaz who heard it from Hisham bin Ammar. So the one clinging to disconnection in this case is stubbornly denying in an obvious manner, like one who weakens a Hadith with an authentic chain by clinging to a weak chain for it. Let us mention then what I found of those trustworthy ones in the sources available to us, then refer for the others to the commentaries and others. First: Ibn Hibban said in his Sahih 8/265/6719 - Al-Ihsan: Al-Husain bin Abdullah Al-Qattan informed us, he said: Hisham bin Ammar told us with it up to his saying: \"Musical instruments\". This Al-Qattan is a trustworthy Hafiz, his biography is in Siyar A'lam Al-Nubala 14/287. Second: Al-Tabarani said in Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir 3/319/3417, and Da'laj in Musnad Al-Muqillin / The Selection from it, Al-Dhahabi's narration Folio 1-2/1, they said: Musa bin Sahl Al-Juni Al-Basri told us: Hisham bin Ammar told us with it like the narration of Al-Bukhari. From the path of Al-Tabarani, Al-Diya Al-Maqdisi narrated it in Muwafaqat Hisham bin Ammar Folio 37/1-2.",

On this occasion I say: The weakener of authentic Hadiths referred to previously has exposed himself in his attempt to weaken this Hadith of Al-Bukhari from all its paths and corroborations with strange twisted methods that do not issue from one who fears Allah or at least feels shy from people. His lying, deception, opposition to scientific rules and rulings of critics from the Huffaz of the Ummah, and preferring his ignorance over their knowledge appeared in it. That was in an article of his published in the Jordanian newspaper Al-Ribat (1). I refuted him in detail at the end of the first volume of Silsilat Al-Ahadith Al-Sahihah New Edition in Rectification number 3, and it has been issued, and to Allah belongs the praise and favor. I had pointed to some of that in the introduction of my new book 'Da'if Al-Adab Al-Mufrad' p. 14-16. I see it necessary to summarize here some important points to be a lesson for whoever wants to take heed, and perhaps he will be among them. He imitated Ibn Hazm in finding fault with the Hadith due to disconnection between Al-Bukhari and his Sheikh Hisham, and turned away from the rightful refutation of Huffaz against him out of arrogance and pride.

He also contradicted more than ten Huffaz who declared the authenticity of the Hadith and the strength of its chain, and the majority of them refuted Ibn Hazm, the role model of that imitator, and he is aware of all that according to the proverb: A goat even if it flew. He claimed that Al-Bukhari's saying: \"So-and-so said to me\" is like his saying: \"So-and-so said,\" both are in the ruling of disconnection. Thus he attributed to Al-Bukhari explicit Tadlis (deception) which a rational person does not accept for himself, not even this one committing crimes against himself by his ignorance. Otherwise, it would necessitate that he not be believed if he says in his speech: \"So-and-so said to me.\" We seek refuge in Allah from ignorance, self-admiration, delusion, and abandonment. Among that is his declaration denying the existence of the word \"Al-Ma'azif\" (musical instruments) in the narration of Al-Bayhaqi and Ibn Hajar in the Hadith of Bishr bin Bakr, while it is in it as you saw (1). And he ignored the narration of Ibn Asakir mentioned previously which contains the mentioned word, not addressing it with a mention while being aware of it, for he saw it in Silsilat Al-Ahadith Al-Sahihah which he poured his refutation upon in weakening this Hadith.

Perhaps that is the basis for Al-Mundhiri's silence in Al-Targhib 3/187 regarding Ibn Hibban's authenticating it, and so he prefaced it with his saying: 'From' ('An). And Ibn al-Qayyim's saying in two places in Al-Ighathah 1/347 and 361: \"This is an authentic chain.\" And Ibn Taymiyyah declared it Hasan as will come. Yes, the Hadith is authentic due to what preceded and the following corroboration. And the sentence of transformation (Maskh) in it has many witnesses in Al-Sahihah 1887. As for the saying of the deluded weakener who was not satisfied in weakening this chain with the mentioned anonymity which I had explicitly stated in Al-Sahihah 90, but added to that casting doubt on the trustworthiness of Hatim bin Huraith, saying at the end of his article referred to previously: \"And Hatim has weakness in him, and 'observation' (Nazar) in his matter, anonymity of state (Jahalah Hal).\" So I say: Let the reader contemplate this pedantry or philosophy. For the last sentence 'anonymity' is what some Imams said, and it is not relied upon as will be explained. As for what is before it, it is nonsense and sophistry or deception, because none of the Imams weakened him nor said: \"There is observation in him\" (Fihi Nazar).

Ibn Adi said in Al-Kamil 2/439 about him: \"And due to the scarcity of his Hadith, Yahya did not know him, and I hope there is no harm in him (La Ba'sa bihi).\" So these are two Imams who knew the man and declared him trustworthy. Added to them is Ibn Hibban's declaring him trustworthy 4/178, and Ibn Sa'd's saying: \"He was known,\" meaning: for probity (Adalah) as I verified in the Rectification referred to previously. So what made this deluded one, whom the love of fame destroyed even by attacking the Hadiths of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, contradict the logical scientific rule: He who knows is a proof against he who does not know? From the completion of his deception and criticizing me is his saying after what was quoted from him: \"And whoever improved his status (Hassana Amrahu) is not like one who spoke against him,\" referring to my declaring him trustworthy by the generality of my saying in the referred place in Al-Sahihah: \"I said: And its men are trustworthy except Malik bin Abi Maryam.\" If you knew this, his mentioned saying reminded me of the famous proverb: \"She threw her disease at me and slipped away.\" That is because the phrase: \"improved his status\" he means by it declaring trustworthy (Tawthiq), but he turned away",

So he turned away from it to that phrase out of plotting and deception, giving the impression to readers that I was unique in improving his status. While the reality - as you saw - is that I am a follower and he is the innovator. Because his saying: \"who spoke against him\" he means by it Ibn Ma'in's previous saying \"I do not know him,\" and he only means he did not know him with criticism nor probity. This is not criticism nor weakening, and it is not correct to say about him: \"Spoke against him\" (Takallama fihi) in the terminology of scholars. So the saying of the innovator mentioned previously: \"He has weakness\" contradicts this saying of Ibn Ma'in, let alone the saying of those who declared him trustworthy. So he opposes all sayings of Imams regarding him. Thus the mentioned proverb and similar apply to him: \"Whoever digs a pit for his brother falls into it.\" And apologies to the noble readers for this lengthiness and similar things which we could do without were it not for refuting the enemies of the authentic Sunnah and revealing their falseness and methods of deception. As for the other corroborator, it is Ibrahim bin Abdul-Hamid bin Dhi Himayah from one who informed him from Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari or Abu Amir: \"I heard the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, regarding wine and musical instruments.\" Thus Al-Bukhari extracted it in the biography of this Ibrahim from Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir, so he said: 1/1/304-305: Sulaiman bin Abdur-Rahman said it to me, he said: Al-Jarrah bin Malih Al-Himsi told us, he said: Ibrahim told us.

The Other: Al-Bukhari's saying following the Hadith of Ibrahim - in which the narrator doubts the Companion of the Hadith by saying: Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari or Abu Amir: \"This is only known from Abu Malik.\" I say: In it is a subtle indication that Malik bin Abi Maryam is known to him because he prioritized his narration which contains certainty that the Companion is Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari over the narration of his Sheikh Hisham bin Ammar which he extracted in his Sahih as preceded and the narration of Ibrahim mentioned just now, and in each of them is doubt in the name of the Companion. Were it not that Al-Bukhari sees that Malik bin Abi Maryam is trustworthy to him, he would not have prioritized his narration over the narrations of Hisham and Ibrahim.

It has a witness by which it increases in strength from the Hadith of Jabir bin Abdullah from Abdur-Rahman bin Awf who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"I did not forbid weeping, but I forbade two foolish immoral voices: A voice at a melody of diversion and play and flutes of Satan, and a voice at a calamity, slapping of faces, tearing of pockets, and a satanic wail.\" Al-Hakim extracted it 4/40, and Al-Bayhaqi 4/69, and in Al-Shu'ab 7/241/1063, and 1064, and Ibn Abi Al-Dunya in Dhamm Al-Malahi Folio 159 /",

From it, intelligent readers know Sheikh Al-Ghazali's ignorance of the ranks of scholars and the disparity in their specialization in knowledge, or his following of his desire when he leans in his weakening of all Hadiths of prohibiting musical instruments on Ibn Hazm, while this is his condition in this science.

He missed the first path, just as he missed the second, third, and fourth Hadiths with their numerous paths. This is considered a gross negligence for such a Hafiz, especially since he was in the process of referencing the statement of Al-Ghazali—after he [Al-Ghazali] mentioned that there is no difference of opinion regarding listening to the voice of the nightingale and other birds, and he analogized the wand, the drum (Tabl), the daff, and others to it. Despite the contradiction in this analogy to the previously mentioned Hadiths and to the principles stating: 'There is no Ijtihad in the presence of a text,' he [Al-Iraqi] nonetheless did well and inclined towards the truth when he commented on that by saying: 'Nothing is excepted from this apart from instruments of diversion (Malahi), strings (Awtaar), and flutes (Mazameer) which the Law has reported the prohibition thereof.' I say: This exception indicates to us that Al-Ghazali did not come across the Lawgiver's prohibition of the drum (Tabl), for example. Therefore, I see that it was obligatory upon Al-Hafiz Al-Iraqi to mention, in his referencing of this sentence of exception, some of the explicit advanced Hadiths regarding the prohibition of the drum, and not suffice with referencing some weak Hadiths like this Hadith of Ubaydullah bin Zahr and its like, and then comment on them saying: 'And they are all weak.' Even though he had referenced the Hadith of Al-Bukhari before it regarding the prohibition of musical instruments (Ma'azif) and refuted Ibn Hazm's weakening of it by citing Abu Dawood and Al-Isma'ili's connection of it; for in referencing what I indicated, there is a strengthening of the indication of this...",

Thus, this authentic Hadith stands in the way of their nullification of its indication, as will be discussed, because Hadiths explain and support one another, as is apparent. In any case, the referencing by the Hafiz [Al-Iraqi] was far better than what Abdul-Wahhab Al-Subki did in the biography of Sheikh Al-Ghazali in his book Tabaqat Al-Shafi'iyyah Al-Kubra. He dedicated a chapter in it (4 / 145 - 182) in which he collected the Hadiths found in the book 'Ihya' [Ulum al-Din]' for which he could not find a chain. He mentioned under it (p. 158) this exception with the wording: 'The Hadith of the prohibition of instruments of diversion, strings, and flutes.' This is very strange that even the Hadith of Al-Bukhari remained hidden from him, and he has other Hadiths like it for which he denied there being any basis, such as the Hadith: 'No one raises his voice in singing except that Allah sends to him two devils on his shoulders...' The Hadith. Al-Tabarani and others narrated it, and it is referenced in Al-Da'ifah (931) and will appear on p. 68.

    "text": "At the conclusion of these authentic Hadiths, of both types—authentic in themselves (Sahih li-Dhatihi) and authentic due to others (Sahih li-Ghayrihi)—it is necessary to mention an important issue to complete the benefit. I say: The scholars of Hadith—may Allah reward them with good—have proceeded upon very important scientific rules to preserve the heritage of the Prophet of the Ummah safe from addition and subtraction. Just as it is not permissible to attribute to him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what he did not say, likewise it is not permissible to waste what he said or turn away from it. The truth is between this and that, as Allah the Exalted said: {And thus we have made you a just community}. There is no doubt that achieving moderation and the middle path between excess and negligence, and distinguishing the authentic from the weak, is not done through ignorance or desire, but through knowledge and following. That can only be through correct understanding (Fiqh) from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and this understanding will not exist except by knowing what the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was upon in word, deed, and approval. Since the matter is so, no one can uphold it except one who is among the Jurists (Fuqaha) and is also knowledgeable in the science of Hadith and its principles, or at least is among their followers and upon their methodology. How excellent is he who said: 'The people of Hadith are the people of the Prophet, even if... they did not accompany his person, they accompanied his breaths.' They are the ones intended by the famous Hadith—despite the difference regarding its confirmation: 'This knowledge will be carried by the trustworthy of every generation; they will expel from it the distortion of the extremists, the plagiarism of the falsifiers, and the interpretation of the ignorant.' Indeed, and by the authentic Hadith: 'Verily, Allah does not take away knowledge by snatching it from the people, but He takes away knowledge by taking away the scholars, until when He leaves no scholar, the people take ignorant heads [as leaders]. They are asked and they give fatwas without knowledge, so they go astray and lead others astray.' The Two Sheikhs narrated it.",

Rather, everyone who is not a scholar must follow the consensus of the people of knowledge.' I say: It is not hidden from the scholars that the basis of this consensus is the saying of the Exalted: {So ask the people of the message if you do not know}. So whoever is not knowledgeable in Hadith, distinguishing its authentic from its sickly, is not permitted to use it as proof except after asking those who know it. This is the text of the verse. So, a fortiori, it is not permissible for him to correct and weaken based on his ignorance, as Al-Ghazali and others among the pretenders to Fiqh (Mutafaqqihah) of the present age have done. The intent is that the likes of these should not be stubborn and weaken a type of Hadith which is known among the scholars as the 'Hasan' Hadith or the 'Sahih due to others' (Sahih li-Ghayrihi), like this sixth Hadith and others. For it is from their principles and rules to strengthen a weak Hadith by the multiplicity of paths, adopting from the likes of the saying of the Exalted regarding the testimony of a woman: {that if one of the two errs, then one of the two may remind the other}.

Often, help from indexes of Hadith extremities does not assist in this; rather, it is the knowledge established in the soul of the one who has practiced it for a long time. The best one who discussed this rule and supported it with what Allah the Exalted gave him of knowledge is Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him, in Majmu' Al-Fatawa (18 / 25 - 26). He said, as in my book Al-Radd Al-Mufhim (may Allah facilitate for me its drafting and publication): 'The weak [Hadith] according to them is of two types: Weak that is not prohibited to act upon, which resembles the Hasan in the terminology of Al-Tirmidhi. And weak whose weakness necessitates abandoning it, which is the flimsy (Wahi). A man may be weak according to them due to frequent mistakes in his Hadith, while correctness is predominant in him; [so they view his Hadith] for the sake of consideration (I'tibar) and support (I'tidad). For the multiplicity of paths and their abundance strengthen one another until knowledge may be obtained by them, even if the transmitters were sinners (Fujjar) or corrupt (Fussaq). So how about if they were just scholars but mistakes were frequent in their Hadith? This is like Abdullah bin Lahi'ah, for he was among the great scholars of the Muslims and was a judge in Egypt, narrating many Hadiths. But his books were burnt, so he began narrating from his memory, and much error occurred in his Hadith, even though correctness was predominant in his Hadith. Ahmad said: I may write the Hadith of a man for consideration, like Ibn Lahi'ah.'",

    "text": "Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) clarified in another statement the reason for strengthening a weak Hadith through paths and the condition for that, and the obligation to hold to this rule. He said in Al-Fatawa (13 / 347): 'The Mursal narrations, if their paths are numerous and are free from collusion intentionally or [was] agreement without intent, are definitively authentic. For the report is either a truth matching the news or it is a lie whose author intended to lie or erred in it. So when it is free from intentional lying and error, it is truth without doubt. If the Hadith comes from two directions or directions—I say: like this Hadith of ours—and it is known that the informers did not collude to fabricate it, and it is known that such agreement does not occur coincidentally without intent, it is known that it is authentic. Like a person reporting an incident that occurred and mentioning the details of statements and actions in it, and another person comes who is known not to have colluded with the first, and he mentions what the first mentioned of details of statements and actions; it is known definitively that the incident is true in general. For if each of them had lied about it intentionally or by error, it would not customarily happen that each of them comes with those details which custom prevents two people agreeing upon without collusion from one of them with the other.' He said: 'By this method, the truthfulness of most of what has multiple different directions of this type of transmitted reports is known, even if one of them is not sufficient either due to its being Mursal or due to the weakness of its transmitter.' He said: 'This principle should be known, for it is a beneficial principle in being certain about many transmitted reports in Hadith, Tafsir, Maghazi (battles), and what is transmitted of people's sayings and actions...'",

This last section of his speech (may Allah have mercy on him) was mentioned similarly by Al-Hafiz Al-Ala'i in Jami' Al-Tahsil (p. 38), and he added: 'For it rises by the sum of them to the degree of Hasan, because what is feared of the narrators' poor memory is removed then, and each of them supports the other.' Similar to it is in the Introduction of Ibn Al-Salah and its summary by Ibn Kathir. Then Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him) said (p. 352): 'In such cases, benefit is derived from the narration of the unknown narrator (Majhul), the one with poor memory, the Mursal Hadith, and the like. For this reason, the people of knowledge used to write such Hadiths and say: It is suitable for witnessing narrations (Shawahid) and consideration (I'tibar), what others are not suitable for.' Then he mentioned the statement of Ahmad previously cited: 'I may write the Hadith of a man to consider it.' I say: From what preceded, a benefit from the benefits of the early Hafizs narrating Hadiths with chains containing weak ones, and then recording them nonetheless in their books, becomes clear to the student of knowledge. It is that they are a basic reference for consideration and tracking follow-ups and witnessing narrations that strengthen one another.

Therefore, Al-Hafiz Ibn Abd Al-Barr said in Al-Tamhid (1 / 58): 'The weak Hadith is not discarded'—meaning: not neglected—'even if it is not used as proof. And many a Hadith with a weak chain is correct in meaning.' The conclusion is that a Hadith weak in chain may be correct in meaning due to the agreement of its meaning with the texts of the Sharia, like the Hadith: 'Blessed is he whose own fault occupies him from the faults of people,' and many like it. However, that does not permit attributing it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It may also be correct in both meaning and structure due to its supporting evidences strengthening it, like this sixth Hadith and some before it. So let this be in your remembrance, and let not the loud speech of the ignorant and the rioting of the rioters turn you away from it.

What I wish to clarify now is that the prohibiting Hadiths, in relation to Ibn Hazm and our view of them, are divided into three categories:\nFirst: That which he weakened, and he is mistaken.\nSecond: That which he did not come across, or he came across some of its paths but not others. Had he come across them and had they been established for him, he would have adopted them, so he is excused—unlike his imitators (Muqallidin)—especially since he commented on what he weakened by saying, swearing without breaking his oath if Allah wills (9 / 59): 'By Allah, if all of it or one of it were attributed (Musnad) via the path of trustworthy narrators to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), we would not hesitate to adopt it.' This is what we think of him, and Allah is his Reckoner. As for those who imitate him after the proof has been established against them and the path has become clear to them, they have no excuse and no dignity. Rather, their likeness is that of people in Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic ignorance) who used to worship jinn; these [people] became Muslim, while those [others] continued in their worship and error, as Allah the Exalted said: {Those whom they invoke seek means of access to their Lord...",

I say, and by Allah is success:\n\nThe First Category:\nIbn Hazm criticized two Hadiths out of the six: The first and the third.\nAs for the first Hadith: I mentioned for it previously two paths to Abdul-Rahman bin Ghanm from Abu Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari. The first: Via the path of Al-Bukhari: Hisham bin Ammar said: Sadaqah bin Khalid narrated to us... with his chain from Abdul-Rahman bin Ghanm Al-Ash'ari: Abu Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari narrated to me—and by Allah he did not lie to me—he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Ibn Hazm found two defects in it: Disconnection (Inqita') between Al-Bukhari and Hisham, and the other is the anonymity (Jahalah) of the Companion Al-Ash'ari. He said in Al-Muhalla (9 / 59), which is the last of the Hadiths of the chapter according to him: 'This is disconnected; it is not connected between Al-Bukhari and Sadaqah bin Khalid, and nothing is authentic in this chapter ever, and everything in it is fabricated (Mawdu').' Thus he said. It is not hidden from students of knowledge, let alone scholars, the strictness and exaggeration contained therein. For disconnection—if true—does not necessitate judging the text as fabricated, especially since it came connected via another path according to him, and a third according to us, as preceded and will come. Yet despite all this, Al-Qaradawi and Al-Ghazali—and those who followed them—closed their eyes to all of that...",

He said in his treatise (p. 97): 'Al-Bukhari did not cite it as attributed (Musnad); rather he said in it: Hisham bin Ammar said.

I say:\n\n1 - The erudite scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim said in Ighathat Al-Lahfan (1 / 259 - 260) and in Tahdhib Al-Sunan (5 / 271 - 272) with some merging and summarization: 'No one has done what Ibn Hazm did in attacking the authenticity of this Hadith to support his false doctrine regarding the permissibility of instruments of diversion. He claimed it is disconnected because Al-Bukhari did not connect his chain to it. This attack is invalid from several aspects:\nOne: That Al-Bukhari met Hisham bin Ammar and heard from him.

This often happens due to the multitude of those who narrated it from him from that Sheikh and its fame. For Al-Bukhari is the furthest of Allah's creation from Tadlis (concealing defects in the chain).\nThree: That he included it in his book named 'Al-Sahih' using it as proof. Were it not authentic according to him, he would not have done that. So the Hadith is authentic without doubt.\nFour: That he suspended it with the format of certainty (Sighat al-Jazm) without the format of weakness (Sighat al-Tamrid). For if he hesitates about a Hadith or it is not upon his condition, he says: 'It is narrated (Yurwa) from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)' and 'It is mentioned (Yudhkar) from him' and the like. But if he says: 'The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said' and 'So-and-so said', then he has affirmed and cut definitively its attribution to him. Here he affirmed the attribution of the Hadith to Hisham, so it is authentic according to him.\nFive: That even if we turned away from all this completely, the Hadith is authentic and connected according to others.'

However, if the suspended Hadith is found from the narration of some Hafizs connected to the one he suspended it from with the condition of authenticity, the ambiguity is removed. For this reason, I took care of this type in the beginning of the matter and authored the book Taghliq Al-Ta'liq. Our Sheikh mentioned in the commentary on Al-Tirmidhi and in his speech on the sciences of Hadith that the Hadith of Hisham bin Ammar came from him connected in the Mustakhraj of Al-Isma'ili.' He said: '...' Then he cited its chain and followed it with the chain of Abu Dawood. Their mention has preceded along with other narrations from a group of trustworthy narrators who said: 'Hisham bin Ammar narrated to us...' So see page 40 - 41.\n\nThen I came across a Hadith rule by Ibn Hazm where he meets with what preceded from the Imams of Hadith, that the mentioned suspension of Al-Bukhari is in the ruling of a connected chain between Al-Bukhari and his Sheikh Hisham bin Ammar. He said in Usul Al-Ahkam (1 / 141): 'As for the Mudallis (one who conceals chain defects), he is divided into two types: One: A just Hafiz who perhaps narrates his Hadith as Mursal, and perhaps connects it, and perhaps narrates it by way of negotiation, fatwa, or debate, so he does not mention a chain for it. And perhaps he limits himself to mentioning some of its narrators without others. This does not harm the rest of his narrations at all, because this is not a wound (Jarhah)...",

However, we leave from his Hadith what we know for certain he sent as Mursal and what we know he dropped some of who were in its chain, and we take from his Hadith what we are not certain about anything of that. Whether he said: \"So-and-so informed us\" or said: \"From so-and-so\" or said: \"So-and-so from so-and-so\", all of that is obligatory to accept unless it is ascertained that he presented a specific Hadith in a non-attributed manner. If we ascertain that, we leave that Hadith alone only, and we take the rest of his narrations.'\n\nI say: This is a text from him regarding what was mentioned, explicit in obligating the acceptance of Al-Bukhari's saying: 'Hisham said,' and that it is like his saying: 'Hisham informed us.' Thus, his declaring it defective due to disconnection falls, and consequently it is proven that his imitators {follow not except assumption and what [their] souls desire} [Al-Najm: 23]. And Allah is the One sought for help.\n\nWith this, the answer to the first defect, which is the disconnection alleged by Ibn Hazm and his imitators, ends, and it becomes clearly evident that it is a mirage.\n\nThere remains the answer to the other defect, which is the doubt in the name of the Companion. It is a doubt even weaker according to scholars. The Hafiz said in Al-Fath (10 / 24): 'Doubt in the name of the Companion does not harm. Ibn Hazm found defect with it, and it is rejected.'\nI say: That is because the narrator from him declaring hearing from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a trustworthy one from the senior Successors (Tabi'in); indeed, it was said he had Companionship. So he is among those knowledgeable about the Companionship of the one speaking to him from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), especially since he emphasized that by saying: 'By Allah, he did not lie to me.' So his doubt and hesitation do not harm us thereafter as long as he informed us of his [the narrator's] Companionship. Supporting this is the statement of Ibn Hazm in the chapter on the attribute of the one whose transfer of reports is obligated to accept from his book Al-Ihkam fi Usul Al-Ahkam...",

So Ibn Hazm's condition of naming the Companion—as indicated by this defect finding of his and explicitly stated in another place in Al-Ihkam (2 / 3 and 83)—while contradicting the generality of his mentioned statement, and contrary to the scholars of Hadith, is something for which there is no evidence.\nMoreover, Imam Al-Bukhari preferred—as we presented on p. 50—that he is Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari, and he is a known Companion. The Hafiz [Ibn Hajar] inclined towards this (10 / 55), saying after mentioning the Imam's preference: 'Furthermore, hesitation in the name of the Companion does not harm as established in the sciences of Hadith. So no attention is paid to the one who found defect in the Hadith because of the hesitation. And it has become preponderant that it is from Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari, and he is a famous Companion.'\nI say: Even according to Ibn Hazm, for I saw him use as proof in Al-Ihkam (4 / 31) a chain containing Muawiyah bin Salih mentioned previously (p. 44 - 45), from Hatim bin Hurayth from Malik bin Abi Maryam: Abdul-Rahman bin Ghanm narrated to us, he said: Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari informed us, he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 'People of my Ummah will surely drink alcohol calling it by other than its name.'",

Abu Muhammad bin Hazm found defect in it due to disconnection between Al-Bukhari and Sadaqah bin Khalid and due to the difference in the name of Abu Malik. This, as you see, I have cited from the narration of nine people from Hisham connectedly; among them are the likes of Al-Hasan bin Sufyan, Abdan, and Ja'far Al-Firyabi, and these are firm Hafizs. As for the difference in the Kunya of the Companion, the Companions are all just (Udool).'\n\nFurthermore, it appears to me that when the one fond of weakening authentic Hadiths did not find room to cling to this defect due to the clarity of its invalidity, he fabricated from himself another defect which is even more invalid according to scholars: that Attiyah bin Qais, whom Muslim used as proof and others authenticated, is unknown (Majhul). This is a false claim that no one said before him, as previously explained (p. 43 - 44), so there is no need to repeat, but pointing it out here is beneficial.\n\nI had mentioned two other paths for the Hadith from Abdul-Rahman bin Ghanm. One of them is the path of Muawiyah bin Salih which I mentioned just now. Ibn Hazm found defect in it by saying in his treatise (p. 97): 'Muawiyah bin Salih is weak, and Malik bin Abi Maryam, it is not known who he is.'

The wonder is that Al-Hafiz Ibn Al-Faradi mentioned him in his book Al-Mu'talif wa Al-Mukhtalif, alerting to his status in it, so how did Ibn Hazm miss coming across him in it?\"\n\nI say: Therefore, nothing is taken from his judgments except what agrees with the famous Imams who were before him, or at least did not contradict them in it.\nWith this ends the discussion on the two Hadiths which Ibn Hazm weakened from the first category of the six authentic Hadiths, with the clarification of his error in them.\n\nNow we speak on the Second Category of them, which is what he did not come across, or he came across some of its paths without others. Included in this is everything other than the two mentioned Hadiths, with some detail. I say:\nThe second Hadith of them: Ibn Hazm explicitly stated after it saying, as preceded: 'It is not known who narrated it!'

    "text": "4 - Chapter Four: On the Indication of the Hadiths regarding the Prohibition of Instruments of Diversion in All Their Forms. Know, my Muslim brother, that the preceding Hadiths are explicitly indicative of the prohibition of musical instruments in all their forms and types, textually specifying some like the flute (Mizmar), drum (Tabl), and lute (Barbat), and appending others to them. This is for two reasons: First: The inclusion of the word 'Ma'azif' for them in the language, as preceded in Chapter Two and as will also come from Ibn al-Qayyim. Second: They are like them in meaning in terms of entertainment (Tatrib) and distraction (Ilha'). This is supported by the saying of Abdullah bin Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both: \"The daff (tambourine) is Haram, musical instruments (Ma'azif) are Haram, the drum (Kubah) is Haram, and the flute (Mizmar) is Haram.\" Al-Bayhaqi extracted it 10/222, from the path of Abdul-Karim Al-Jazari from Abu Hashim Al-Kufi from him. I say: This is an authentic chain if Abu Hashim Al-Kufi is Abu Hashim Al-Sinjari named Sa'd, for he is Jazari like Abdul-Karim, and they mentioned that he narrated from him. However, I did not see anyone mention that he is Kufi. In Thiqat Ibn Hibban 4/296, it is mentioned that he resided in Damascus. And Allah knows best. However, the First Hadith \"They declare as lawful illegal sexual intercourse, silk, wine, and musical instruments..\"",

It has come in language books, including Al-Mu'jam Al-Wasit: \"Istahalla al-shay'\" means he counted it lawful. Therefore, the scholar Sheikh Ali Al-Qari said in Al-Mirqat 5/106: \"And the meaning is: They count these things as lawful by bringing forth doubts and weak evidences. Among them is what some of our scholars - meaning the Hanafis - mentioned that silk is only forbidden if it is touching the body, but if it is worn over clothes, there is no harm in it. This is a restriction without textual or rational evidence, and due to the unrestrictedness of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: 'Whoever wears silk in this world will not wear it in the Hereafter' (1). Likewise, for some scholars regarding musical instruments there are attachments whose explanation would be lengthy. And this Hadith is supported by His saying, Exalted is He: {And of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech to mislead [others] from the way of Allah without knowledge}.\" I say: Similar to what he mentioned about the Hanafis is their differentiation between wine made from grapes, so little and much of it is forbidden, and wine made from dates and others, so only the large intoxicating amount is forbidden. This is a detestable literalism. Similar to it is the differentiation between music arousing to sex, so it is forbidden, and other music, so it is lawful, as preceded in the Introduction in the refutation of Abu Zahra",

How not, when he mixes between the speech of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and the speech of Al-Bukhari, attributing his speech, peace and blessings be upon him, to Al-Bukhari? This is extremely strange as is apparent. I do not know if it is an intellectual mistake or a slip of the pen? And both are bitter. This is first. Second: That reasoning is invalidated by the explicit statement of the Hadiths following the Hadith of musical instruments regarding the prohibition of types of musical instruments. And in the Sixth Hadith and the corroborations under it is the explicit statement that among the causes of transformation, swallowing by earth, and bombardment is taking instruments and female singers.

If they were lawful, he would not have dispraised them for declaring them lawful, nor would he have coupled declaring them lawful with declaring lawful wine and illegal sexual intercourse... And he threatened the declares of musical instruments as lawful in it that Allah would cause the earth to swallow them and transform them into monkeys and pigs. Even if the threat is for all these actions, each one has a share in the dispraise and threat. So this truth has no hiddenness... So leave me from the byways.\" The bitter truth is that Sheikh Al-Ghazali and his likes from the contemporary callers or writers do not have a scientific methodology from which they proceed in what they adopt of rulings and issues, neither from the Fiqh perspective nor from the Hadith perspective. Rather, it is blind randomness coupled in many cases with following desires. Sometimes you see him with the Opinionated or Rationalists - as they say today - in opposing explicit authentic texts. Rather, he surpassed them in that by stages, contradicting all Imams and Fuqaha without exception, and I mentioned in the introduction some examples. And sometimes you see him as a rigid Literalist (Zahiri) like a solid rock, imitating some strict Zahiri Imams even if he contradicted all Imams of Hadith and Fiqh. For just as he imitated Ibn Hazm in his weakening of authentic Hadiths of musical instruments, he likewise imitated him in his interpretation of the Hadith of musical instruments with a false interpretation.

Rather, he interpreted the Hadith of Mu'awiyah bin Salih devoid of it (the word Yastahillun), and in it - as preceded p. 45 -: \"And musical instruments will be played over their heads..\" So Ibn Hazm said 9/57: \"And there is not in it that the mentioned threat is only for musical instruments, nor is it for taking female singers. The apparent is that it is for their declaring wine lawful by other than its name.\" Although this view he deemed apparent is clear affectation and false interpretation due to the preceding Hadiths and Ibn al-Qayyim's explanation, Al-Shawkani answered it with another answer. He said in Nail Al-Awtar 8/85, after relating Ibn Hazm's interpretation summarized without attributing it to him, and it contains a clear refutation against Al-Ghazali as well: \"It is answered that conjunction (Iqtiran) does not indicate that the prohibited is only the combination. Otherwise, it would imply that Zina explicitly mentioned in the Hadith - meaning the Hadith of Al-Bukhari - is not forbidden except when drinking wine and using musical instruments. And the consequent is false by consensus, so the antecedent is like it. Also, it would imply in the likes of His saying, Exalted is He: {Indeed, he did not used to believe in Allah, the Most Great. Nor did he encourage the feeding of the poor} that lack of belief in Allah is not forbidden except with lack of encouraging feeding the poor. If it is said: The prohibition of such matters mentioned in the binding argument is known from other evidence, the answer is that the prohibition of musical instruments is known from other evidence as well, as preceded.

For if they declared them lawful while believing that the Messenger forbade them, they would be disbelievers and would not be from his Ummah. And if they acknowledged that they are forbidden, it would be likely that they not be punished by transformation like the rest of those who continue doing these sins. And it would not be said about them: 'Yastahillun' (They declare lawful), for the one declaring a thing lawful is the one who takes it believing its lawfulness. So it resembles that their declaring wine lawful means they name it by other than its name as in the Hadith, so they drink forbidden drinks and do not call them wine. And their declaring musical instruments lawful is by their belief that instruments of diversion are merely hearing a sound with pleasure, and this is not forbidden like the melodies of birds. And their declaring silk and all its types lawful is by their belief that it is lawful for fighting, and they heard that wearing it is permissible during fighting according to many scholars, so they analogized all their states to that. These three interpretations occur in the three groups about whom Ibn al-Mubarak, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him, said: 'And did anything corrupt the religion except kings... and evil rabbis and monks?' It is known that these (interpretations) do not avail their owners against Allah anything after the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, conveyed and clarified the prohibition of these things with a clarification cutting off excuse, as is known in its places.\"",

So that the student be knowledgeable from the Fiqh perspective as well, and thereby increase in knowledge of Al-Ghazali's deviation in his book 'The Prophetic Sunnah Between the People of Fiqh and the People of Hadith' - and those who followed his path - from Fiqh and its scholars just as he deviated from Sunnah and its scholars. For he described them all - with extreme ignorance - as 'Preachers' (Wu'az) p. 74, for their prohibiting of singing. Imam Al-Shawkani said in Nail Al-Awtar 8/83, summarized: \"There has been disagreement regarding singing with an instrument of diversion and without it. The majority went to prohibition, using as evidence what preceded - meaning the Hadiths. And the people of Medina and those who agreed with them from the Zahiri scholars and Sufis went to granting concession (Rukhsa) in listening (Sama'), even with the oud (lute) and reed flute (Yara').\" Then he quoted from some of them that he related sayings from some of the Salaf regarding permissibility, and expanded on that an expansion of no benefit, because they are sayings mostly suspended (Mu'allaqah) with no head or tail (unfounded).

But before that, I want to draw attention to two matters: First: That the intended meaning by 'The Majority' here is the four Imams following the Salaf, as detailed by the scholar Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya in Ighathat Al-Lahfan 1/226-230. Therefore, when Ibn Al-Mutahhar Al-Shi'i attributed to Ahlus-Sunnah the permissibility of instruments of diversion and singing, Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah belied him in his refutation of him in Minhaj Al-Sunnah, saying 3/439: \"This is from the lies against the four Imams, for they agree on the prohibition of musical instruments which are instruments of diversion like the oud and the like. If someone destroys them, he is not liable for the value of the destroyed item according to them; rather, taking them as property is prohibited according to them.\" The other matter: Al-Shawkani's attributing the concession to the people of Medina gives the impression by its absoluteness that Malik is among them, and it is not so, even if he was preceded in it, like the saying of Al-Dhahabi in the biography of Yusuf bin Ya'qub bin Abi Salamah Al-Majishun: \"I say: The people of Medina take concession in singing and they are known for leniency in it.\" And he mentioned therein: That his slave girls in his house used to play the musical instrument (Mi'zaf). So I say: Imam Malik is certainly not among them. Rather, he and others from the scholars of Medina denounced it on them. Abu Bakr Al-Khallal narrated in Al-Amr bi Al-Ma'ruf p. 32, and Ibn Al-Jawzi in Talbis Iblis p. 244, with an authentic chain from Ishaq bin Isa Al-Tabba' - trustworthy from the men of Muslim - who said:",

None does this among us except the immoral ones.\" As for the sayings Al-Shawkani quoted which were referred to previously and we promised to speak about, the answer is from two aspects: First: That even if their attribution to their speaker is authentic, and among them are the Kufan and the Medinan and others, there is no proof in them for contradicting the authentic explicit Hadiths presented previously. Second: That the opposite has been authentically reported from some of them, so taking it is more appropriate, rather it is obligatory. Let me mention what I was able to find of them: First: Shuraih the Judge. Abu Husain said: That a man broke a Tanbur (mandolin-like instrument) of another man, so he brought the dispute to Shuraih, and he did not make him liable for anything. Ibn Abi Shaybah extracted it in Al-Musannaf 7/312/3275, and its chain is authentic. And Al-Bayhaqi 6/101, and Al-Khallal 26, and he said after it: Hanbal said: I heard Abu Abdullah say: \"It is Munkar (denounced/instrument), he judged nothing for it.\" And Abu Abdullah is Imam Ahmad.

This, and among some sayings mentioned by Al-Shawkani is what might have an authentic chain, but its indication of permissibility is questionable in terms of its text.

He said regarding Ayyub 6/20: \"I say: Perfection ends with him.\" The other: That it is more fitting for Abdullah bin Ja'far, may Allah be pleased with them both. For the ruling of the daff differs from all instruments of diversion in that playing it is permissible for women in weddings as preceded - and will come. Therefore, we found scholars differentiating between them and it regarding destroying them. Al-Khallal narrated p. 28 from Ja'far - he is Ibn Muhammad - who said: I asked Abdullah about breaking the Tanbur, Oud, and Tabl (drum)? He did not see anything (wrong) with it - and similar preceded recently from Ahmad and Shuraih. Ja'far said: It was said to him: What about Daffs? He saw that the Daff is not to be interfered with.

And upon this is carried what Al-Khallal mentioned p. 27, from Al-Hasan meaning: Al-Basri who said: \"Daffs are not from the matter of Muslims in anything, and the companions of Abdullah meaning Ibn",

He did not dislike that. He was asked about the daff at the deceased (funeral)? He did not see harm in breaking it and said: The companions of Abdullah used to take daffs from boys in the alleys and slash them. The sentence about the Companions was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah also 9/57, with an authentic chain. The conclusion is that we absolve Abdullah bin Ja'far, may Allah be pleased with them both, from having bought the girl for her playing on the oud due to what was preponderated previously. Otherwise, there is no proof in other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, especially since Abdullah bin Umar - who is more knowledgeable in Fiqh and knowledge than him - said: Sufficient for you today is the flute of Satan (1). This, and the other saying which is questionable is what Al-Shawkani attributed to Shu'bah that he heard a Tanbur in the house of Al-Minhal bin Amr the famous Muhaddith. I say: The origin of this is what Al-Uqayli narrated in Al-Du'afa 4/237, from the path of Wahb - he is Ibn Jarir - from Shu'bah who said: I came to the house of Al-Minhal bin Amr and heard from it the sound of a Tanbur, so I returned and did not ask him. I said: Why did you not ask him, for perhaps he did not know. I say: Its chain to Shu'bah is authentic. From it, it becomes clear that it is not permissible to crowd Al-Minhal",

So Shu'bah's leaving him is rejected. Therefore, Wahb bin Jarir objected to him. Al-Hafiz said in his biography in the Introduction p. 446: \"And this is a correct objection, for this does not necessitate impugning Al-Minhal.\" Before him, Al-Dhahabi said in Al-Mizan: \"This does not necessitate criticizing the Sheikh.\" Moreover, this narration can be turned against the permitters because Shu'bah denounced the sound of the Tanbur, so he is correct in that, even if he erred in his thought that Al-Minhal was among those permitting it! The Conclusion: The scholars and Fuqaha - including the four Imams - are agreed on the prohibition of instruments of diversion in following the Prophetic Hadiths and Salafi Narrations. Even if the contrary is authentically reported from some of them, he is overcome by the evidence mentioned.

He said commenting on her saying: 'And they were not singers': \"We said: Yes, but she said: they were singing. So singing from them is established. And her saying: 'they were not singers' means: they were not proficient. All this is no proof. The proof is only in his denial, peace and blessings be upon him, against Abu Bakr's saying: 'Is it the flute of Satan in the presence of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him?' So it is correct that it is absolutely permissible with no dislike, and whoever denied it has erred without doubt.\" In answer to him I say, and I seek Allah's help: It is very clear to every onlooker in this Hadith that it does not contain the absolute permissibility he claimed. How so, when it would include with the young girls - adult women, and even men too, and include all instruments of diversion and all days of the year - and this is a very clear error involving loading the Hadith with what it does not bear.

Rather, it contains his denial, peace and blessings be upon him, of Abu Bakr's denial against the two girls, and he justified that by his saying: \"For indeed every people has an Eid and this is our Eid.\" I say: This justification is from his eloquence, peace and blessings be upon him, because on one hand he indicates by it his approval of Abu Bakr's denial of flutes (Mzamir) as a principle (Asl), and declares on the other hand his approval of the two girls' singing with the daff, indicating by that that it is an exception from the principle. As if he, peace and blessings be upon him, is saying to Abu Bakr: You were correct in your adherence to the principle, and you erred in your denial against the two girls, for it is a day of Eid. I had mentioned something like this in my introduction to Sheikh Nu'man Al-Alusi's book: Al-Ayat Al-Bayyinat fi 'Adam Sama' Al-Amwat. I asked in it p. 46-47: Where did Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, get this principle from? I said: The answer: It came from the teachings of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and his Hadiths are many in prohibiting singing and instruments of diversion. Then I mentioned some of their previous sources.

I had mentioned there in the referred introduction other examples indicating the importance of the Prophet's, peace and blessings be upon him, approval of a saying, and that it is one of the strong reasons for understanding the subject in which approval occurred correctly. Among that is the Hadith of the well (Qalib) of Badr and his calling, peace and blessings be upon him, to the slain polytheists in it: \"O so-and-so son of so-and-so..\" and the saying of Umar and others from the Companions: \"What do you speak to bodies with no souls in them?\" So he approved them on that but answered them by his saying: \"You do not hear what I say more than them.\" Agreed upon. So I used this story as evidence there that the default regarding the dead is that they do not hear, based on two matters. What concerns me now is what relates to approval. So I said: p. 39-42: The other matter: That the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, approved Umar and others from the Companions on what was settled in their souls and belief that the dead do not hear. Some of them alluded to that and some mentioned it explicitly.

Were it not that they had previous knowledge of that which they received from him, peace and blessings be upon him, they would not have hastened to say that to him. Even if we assume they were hasty and denied without previous knowledge, the duty of notification (Tabligh) then required the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, to clarify to them that this belief of theirs is wrong and has no basis in Sharia. We did not see in any of the narrations of the Hadith such clarification. The most he said to them was: \"You do not hear what I say more than them.\" This - as you see - does not contain establishing a general rule for all dead contradicting their previous belief. Rather, it is information about the people of the well specifically. Moreover, that is not absolute as explained previously. Their hearing then is specific to that time and to what the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to them only. It is a specific incident with no generality, so it does not indicate they hear always and forever and everything said to them, nor does it include others of the dead absolutely. As for the explicit (statement), it is in what Ahmad narrated 3/287 from the Hadith of Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: [Authentic] So Umar heard his voice and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, do you call them after three (days)? And do they hear? Allah Mighty and Majestic says: {Indeed, you will not make the dead hear}.\" He said: \"By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you do not hear [what I say] more than them, but they cannot answer.\" Its chain is authentic on the condition of Muslim. Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, explicitly stated that the mentioned Verse is the reliance in that hastening, and that they understood from its generality the inclusion of the people of the well in it. Therefore, the matter was confusing to them, so they declared that to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, to remove their confusion, and that was by his previous explanation.",

Rather, he approved them on that but clarified to them what was hidden from them regarding the state of the well, and that they truly heard his speech, and that is a specific matter excepted from the Verse as a miracle for him, peace and blessings be upon him, as preceded. Then I said there: Be aware of this and know that it is from precise Fiqh to take care in tracking what the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, approved of matters and using it as evidence, because his approval is truth as is known. Otherwise, without it, understanding might stray from correctness in many texts. We will not take you far; this is the witness before you. Many authors and others have become accustomed to using this Hadith - the Hadith of the well - as evidence that the dead hear, holding onto the apparent meaning of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"You do not hear what I say more than them,\" not paying attention to his, peace and blessings be upon him, approval of the Companions on their belief that the dead do not hear... Thus the Hadith returns - by paying attention to what we mentioned - as a proof that the dead do not hear, and that this is the default (Asl). So it is not permissible to depart from it except with a text, as is the case in every general text. And Allah is the Guardian of success. The researcher might find many examples of this type.

And just as he introduced a specification to the first, likewise he introduced a specification to this saying of Abu Bakr which necessitated the permissibility of the mentioned singing on the day of Eid.

Then I said p. 48-49: As for the fact that he, peace and blessings be upon him, did not deny on the two girls - it is true, but that was on a day of Eid, so it does not include other than it. This is first. Second: When he, peace and blessings be upon him, ordered Abu Bakr not to deny on them by his saying: \"Leave them,\" he followed that with his saying: \"For indeed every people has an Eid...\" This is a causative sentence indicating that the cause (Illah) of permissibility is 'Eid-ness' - if the expression is correct. It is known that the ruling revolves with the cause in existence and non-existence. So if this cause is negated by not being a day of Eid, singing is not permitted in it as is apparent.

The speech on the Hadith of Aisha regarding hearing singing has become long, and there is no harm in that, Allah the Exalted willing, for the witness from it is clear and important. It is that the student of knowledge's observation of the Prophet's, peace and blessings be upon him, approval of a matter opens for him a door of Fiqh and understanding he would not have reached without it. Such was the case in the Hadith of the well. The Conclusion: Ibn Hazm's error originated from his illusion that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, denied Abu Bakr's denial on the two girls absolutely, and not from his, peace and blessings be upon him, approval of the two girls. That is because this only indicates a permissibility restricted to a day of Eid as preceded, and to the daff not all instruments of diversion, and to young females as stated by scholars. Ibn Al-Jawzi said in Talbis Iblis 1/239: \"The apparent regarding these two girls is young age because Aisha was young and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to send girls to her to play with her (1).\" Therefore, I do not think Ibn Hazm would generalize the ruling were it not for that illusion. My thought is supported by the mentioned Hadith of sending (girls to play), for he adopted it in its specific indication and did not generalize it. He said in Al-Muhalla 10/75-76: \"It is permissible for young girls specifically to play with images (dolls), and it is not lawful for others...\" I say: This is the Fiqh required by combining texts, like the general with the specific",

He did not strike this against those Hadiths as some virtuous ones went to, because it is contrary to the mentioned combination. Thus should have been Ibn Hazm's stance on instruments of diversion: to say they are prohibited just as he prohibited images, and to except from them the daff in Eid. However, success did not accompany him, so he did not come across the preceding Hadiths regarding prohibiting instruments. Sufficient for him in that was Abu Bakr's saying in the presence of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Is it the flute of Satan in the presence of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him?\" were it not for his illusion which I explained previously. And we showed that the Hadith is an argument against him as scholars said. There is no harm in mentioning some of their sayings in that. 1 - Abu Al-Tayyib Al-Tabari (d. 450) said: This Hadith is our argument because Abu Bakr named that the flute of Satan and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not deny Abu Bakr's saying. He only prevented him from harshness in denial due to his good companionship, especially on the day of Eid. Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, was young at that time. Nothing was reported from her after her puberty and acquiring (knowledge) except dispraise of singing. Her nephew Al-Qasim bin Muhammad used to dispraise singing and prevent hearing it, and he took knowledge from her. I quoted it from Ibn Al-Jawzi's book 1/253-254. 2 - Ibn Taymiyyah said in the treatise Al-Sama' wa Al-Raqs (Listening and Dancing) 2/285 - Majmu'at Al-Rasa'il Al-Kubra: In this Hadith is a clarification that this was not from the habit of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and his companions",

I say: Yes. So he proceeds until I said: No. So he put down his hands and returned his mount to the path and said: I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and he heard a shepherd's flute so he did like this.

    "text": "\"If it were forbidden (Haram), the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, would not have allowed Ibn Umar to hear it, nor would Ibn Umar have allowed Nafi' to hear it. But he, peace be upon him, disliked everything that is not of drawing closer to Allah, just as he disliked eating while reclining and... and... If that were forbidden, he, peace be upon him, would not have limited himself to blocking his ears from it without ordering it be stopped and forbidding it.\" So I say: May Allah forgive Ibn Hazm, for matters were hidden from him that are not befitting his knowledge to be hidden from him: First: The difference between 'Sama' (hearing) and 'Istima' (listening) was absent from him, so he interpreted the first as the second, which is an apparent error linguistically, Quranically, and Sunnah-wise. Therefore, Ibn Taymiyyah said following the Hadith of Aisha mentioned previously: \"And there is not in the Hadith of the two girls that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, listened to that. Command and prohibition only relate to listening, not mere hearing, as in seeing; it only relates to the intention of looking, not what occurs unintentionally. Similarly in smelling perfume, the Muhrim is only forbidden from intending to smell, but if he smells what he did not intend, there is nothing on him. Likewise in experiencing prohibitions like the five senses of hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch; command and prohibition in that only relate to what the servant has intention and action in. As for what happens without his choice, there is no command or prohibition in it.\" This is among what the Hadith of Ibn Umar was interpreted with... so he mentioned it. For some people say - assuming the authenticity of the Hadith (1) - why did he not order Ibn Umar to block his ears? It is answered that Ibn Umar was not listening but rather hearing, and there is no sin in this. The Prophet only diverted seeking",

Even if he did not block his ears, he would not bear sin by that, unless there is in his hearing a religious harm that is not repelled except by blocking. Second: That Ibn Hazm seems to imagine that the piping shepherd was in front of him, peace and blessings be upon him, so he could order and forbid him. There is nothing in the Hadith of that. Rather, perhaps there is in it what might indicate the opposite, which is that he was far away, his person not seen, but his voice heard. Therefore, the scholar Ibn Abdul-Hadi said after mentioning similar speech to Ibn Taymiyyah, its summary is: And the approval of the shepherd does not indicate its permissibility because it is a specific incident. Perhaps he heard him without seeing him, or far from him on a mountaintop or a place impossible to reach, or perhaps the shepherd was not religiously accountable (Mukallaf), so denial was not incumbent upon him (1). Third: That the prohibition of singing and instruments of diversion is not more severely prohibited than wine. And he knows that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, lived as long as Allah willed among his companions while they were drinking it before prohibition. So is it correct to say: That he, peace and blessings be upon him, approved them and did not forbid them? Likewise we say - assuming the indication of the Hadith for permissibility -: It is possible that it was before prohibition. With probability, deduction falls. Fourth and Last: And on the mentioned assumption, it is a specific permissibility for the shepherd's flute, which is a primitive, naive, silly instrument in terms of its arousing of souls and moving of natures and taking them out of the limit of moderation. So where is it compared to other instruments like the oud and qanun",

There is no doubt that the evidence in this Hadith - and on the mentioned assumption - is more specific than the claim, as the Fuqaha say. Otherwise, the truth is that there is no evidence in it at all. Rather, in it is evidence for the dislike of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, for the sound of the shepherd's flute. It is undoubtedly a legislative dislike, entering into the generality of His saying, Exalted is He: {There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern.} Therefore, Abdullah bin Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, followed him and put his fingers in his ears despite the absence of intention (to listen) as we explained. So with the presence of intention, it is more severely disliked as is not hidden. Therefore Ibn Al-Jawzi, may Allah have mercy on him, said p. 247: \"If this was their action regarding a sound that does not exceed moderation, how about the singing of the people of the time and their piping?!\" I say: Then what is said about the people of our time and their music? Is there anyone who takes heed? This, and before concluding the speech on this chapter, it appeared to me to present the readers with a rare beneficial narration (Athar) which I did not see anyone who wrote on instruments of diversion address. It is from one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, Umar bin Abdul-Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him. The noble reader will be sure from it that musical instruments were denounced among the Salaf and that the one striving to publicize them deserves discretionary punishment (Ta'zir) and public exposure (Tashhir).

Abu Hafs Al-Umawi Umar bin Abdullah (1) said: Umar bin Abdul-Aziz wrote to the tutor of his children ordering him to raise them on hatred of musical instruments: \"Let the first thing they believe of your discipline be the hatred of instruments of diversion, whose beginning is from Satan and whose end is the wrath of the Most Merciful. For it has reached me from the trustworthy ones of the people of knowledge: that attending musical instruments and listening to songs and being fond of them sprouts hypocrisy in the heart just as grass sprouts water. And by my life, avoiding that by leaving attendance of those places is easier for the intelligent one than establishing hypocrisy in his heart.\" Ibn Abi Al-Dunya extracted it in Dhamm Al-Malahi Folio 6/1, and via his path Abu Al-Faraj Ibn Al-Jawzi p. 250.

Personally, I have not found any evidence that constitutes a proof for that, even as a suspended narration. I saw Ibn al-Qayyim mention in his book *Mas'alat al-Sama'* (p. 133) a tradition from the narration of Abu Shu'ayb al-Harrani with his chain from Khalid from Ibn Sirin that Umar bin Al-Khattab used to ask about it if he heard the sound of a Daff. If they said: \"A wedding or a circumcision,\" he would remain silent.\nIts men are trustworthy, but it is disconnected (Munqati'). He [Ibn al-Qayyim] went too far in attributing it to Abu Shu'ayb al-Harrani; although he is trustworthy, he is not a known author. It was narrated by those more famous and trustworthy than him among the compilers, such as Ibn Abi Shaybah (4/192), who said: \"He affirmed it\" instead of \"he remained silent.\" And Abdul-Razzaq (11/5), and from him Al-Bayhaqi (7/290) via two paths from Ayyub from Ibn Sirin: That Umar used to... etc. The wording of Ibn Abi Shaybah is: From Ibn Sirin, who said: I was informed that Umar...",

She said: \"I had vowed that if Allah returned you righteous—and in a narration: safe—I would beat the Daff before you [and sing].\" He said: \"If you have done so—and in the other narration: if you vowed—then do it, and if you have not done so, then do not do it.\" So she beat it. Abu Bakr entered while she was beating it, and others entered while she was beating it. Then Umar entered. He [the narrator] said: So she put her Daff behind her—and in the other narration: under her buttocks—and then sat upon it while she was veiled. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Indeed, Satan is afraid—and in a narration: fears—of you, O Umar.

Ibn al-Qayyim cited it very briefly in his book *Mas'alat al-Sama'* (p. 299), but he erred in its text, adding at its end a denounced (Munkar) addition worded: \"When Umar came, he ordered her to be silent and said: Indeed, this is a man who does not like falsehood.\" This order and statement were only narrated in another story from the Hadith of Al-Aswad bin Sari' in Al-Hakim, Ahmad, and Al-Tabarani via the path of Abdul-Rahman bin Abi Bakra from him regarding him reciting praises to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with which he praised his Lord. Al-Dhahabi weakened it. The story of reciting poetry is authentic without the mention of Umar, and I have clarified that in *Al-Sahihah* (3179). In summary, this story of Umar is weak. The virtuous brother Sa'd bin Abdullah Al-Humayyid graded it Hasan in his commentary on *Mukhtasar Istidrak Al-Hafiz Al-Dhahabi* (5/2332, 2334) based on the sum of its two weak paths from Abdul-Rahman bin Abi Bakra, not paying attention to its denounced nature due to contradicting the authentic path which is devoid of it. Furthermore, it has no basis in the story of the black maidservant, contrary to what Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him) did. There are other additions that occurred after the Hadith in *Mawarid al-Zam'an* (p. 493, 494) that are more denounced than the previous one, with the wording: \"She beat the Daff and said: The full moon rose upon us (Tala'a al-Badru 'Alayna)... from Thaniyat al-Wada'... Gratitude is obligatory upon us... as long as a caller calls to Allah.\" This is a weak addition here, and weak in the story of his (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) arrival in Medina. Its chain is dilemma-ridden (Mu'dal), and it does not clarify whether his arrival was from Tabuk—as Ibn al-Qayyim cited it in *Mas'alat al-Sama'* (p. 265, 266) and used it as evidence in *Zad al-Ma'ad* (18/3)—or from Mecca during his migration from it, as indicated by the action of Al-Bayhaqi in *Dala'il al-Nubuwwah* (2/506, 507), followed by Al-Hafiz (7/261). Whether this or that is more correct, the origin of the story is weak and not established, and whatever is built upon weak is weak. Al-Ghazali added another addition more denounced than all that preceded with the wording: \"With the Daff and melodies?\" It has no basis in the story as stated by Al-Hafiz Al-Iraqi in *Takhrij Al-Ihya'* (2/277). I have detailed the discussion on this story and what we mentioned regarding it in *Al-Da'ifah* (2/63) and *Al-Sahihah* (5/331).

Analogizing joy for the arrival of any absentee, no matter their status, to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is an analogy with a discrepancy, as is apparent.

Thus, the permissibility of the Daff in all joyous occasions is not derived from it, because there is no one whose [return] creates joy like the joy for him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and because that contradicts the general evidences prohibiting musical instruments, Daffs, and others, except what has been exempted as we mentioned just now.\"\nSimilar to this is in Volume Five of *Al-Sahihah* (332–333).

He used to do the *Nasb* well. While Rabah was singing for him, Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) overtook them during his Caliphate. He said: 'What is this?' Abdul-Rahman said: 'There is no harm in this; we divert ourselves and shorten [the journey] for us.' So Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 'If you must do so, then stick to the poetry of Dirar bin Al-Khattab.' Dirar was a man from Banu Muharib bin Fihr.\"\nAl-Bayhaqi reported it (10/224) with a good (Jayyid) chain. He said: \"*Al-Nasb* is a type of singing of the Bedouins, and it resembles the *Huda'* (camel driving song).\" Abu Ubayd al-Harawi said this. In *Al-Qamus*: \"*Nasb* of the Arabs: A type of their songs, thinner/softer than *Huda'*.\"\nI say: In these Hadiths and traditions is an apparent indication of the permissibility of singing without instruments in some occasions, such as reminding of death, longing for family and homeland, or for recreation and distraction from the difficulty and hardship of travel, and similar things that are not taken as a profession and do not exceed the limit of moderation. Thus, it should not be accompanied by swaying, bending, and stomping the feet, which violates manliness/modesty, as in the Hadith of Umm Alqamah, the freed slave of Aisha: \"That the nieces of Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) were circumcised and felt pain from that.

Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab authenticated it in *Nuzhat al-Asma'* (p. 55 – Taybah edition).\nAl-Bayhaqi titled these Hadiths and traditions with his saying: \"Chapter: The man who does not attribute himself to singing, nor is he brought for that purpose, nor is he paid for it, but he is known to express delight in the moment and hums during it.\"\nSheikh Abu al-Faraj Ibn al-Jawzi has good speech on this issue which he cited in his book *Talbis Iblis* in more than one chapter. To complete the benefit, I will summarize it for the readers. He said (p. 237-241):\n\"People have spoken about singing and have been lengthy.

The Jurists among our companions [Hanbalis] said: 'The testimony of a singer and a dancer is not accepted. And Allah is the Granter of success.'\"\n\n**8- Chapter Eight: The Wisdom of the Prohibition of Musical Instruments and Singing**\n\nYou must, O Muslim, believe that for everything Allah has legislated for His servants—whether command, prohibition, or permission—there is a wisdom, nay, profound wisdoms, known by those who know them and ignored by those who ignore them; they appear to some and remain hidden to others. Therefore, it is obligatory upon the true Muslim to hasten to obey Allah and not hesitate in that until the wisdom becomes clear to him. For that is contrary to Faith, which is absolute submission to the Wise Lawgiver. Therefore, He, the Mighty and Majestic, said in the Noble Quran: {But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.} [Al-Nisa': 65]. Upon this our righteous Salaf lived, so Allah granted them might and opened for them the lands and the hearts of the servants. The end of this Ummah will not be rectified except by what rectified its beginning.\nAbu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) had the lead in this, and he was a righteous example for others, as indicated by his magnificent stance in the story of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, in what Sahl bin Hunayf (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated. He said: [Authentic] \"O people, accuse yourselves! We were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the Day of Hudaybiyyah, and if we saw fighting [as an option], we would have fought—and that was during the truce that was between the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the polytheists.

You, O Muslim, must believe with certainty that everything Allah has legislated for His servants—whether command, prohibition, or permission—contains wisdom, even profound wisdom. Those who know it may recognize it, and those who do not may remain unaware. It becomes clear to some people and hidden from others. Therefore, what is truly required of a Muslim is to hasten to obey Allah without hesitation, even before the wisdom becomes apparent, for hesitation contradicts true faith, which is complete submission to the Lawgiver, the All-Wise. Thus, Allah the Exalted said in the Noble Qur’an: {But no, by your Lord, they do not truly believe until they make you, O Muhammad, judge concerning that over which they dispute, and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in full submission} [An-Nisā’: 65]. Upon this principle our righteous predecessors lived, so Allah honored them, granted them victory, and opened for them lands and hearts. The latter part of this Ummah will not be rectified except by what rectified its earliest generations. Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, excelled greatly in this matter and was a model example for others, as shown by his remarkable stance in the story of the Treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah.

Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: \"They marveled at the obedience of his Companions to him.\" Ahmad reported it (1/270) and others with an authentic chain.\nThe point is that this obedience must be realized in every Muslim, outwardly and inwardly, whether it agrees with his desire or contradicts it. One of the implications of this is that he should not strike examples for Allah and His rulings. So he should not analogize the melodious sounds coming out of a human to the sound of the nightingale and birds, saying for example: \"If reciting poetry without melodies is permissible, then reciting it with...",

    "text": "...melodies is permissible, for if individual permissible things are combined, that combination is permissible,\" as Al-Ghazali—may Allah forgive him—said, reaching thereby the permissibility of musical melodies or at least some of them, based on analogy with the sounds of birds. Yet he is the author of books on Usul al-Fiqh, in which it is stated that there is no analogy in the presence of a text. Therefore, scholars—like Ibn al-Jawzi, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, and others—successively refuted him and his likes among the Sufis.\nThe mentioned analogy reminded me of another analogy more malicious than it, through which its owner reached the permissibility of intoxicating Nabidh (date wine). Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned it while refuting the Sufis who deem *Sama'* (listening to music) with melodies permissible using the mentioned analogy. He said (may Allah have mercy on him) in *Mas'alat al-Sama'* (270-271):\n\"The Second Aspect: That if each of poetry and composition were permissible individually, it would not necessitate their permissibility when combined. For composition has a specific property by which the ruling changes. This argument is like the argument of one who said: 'If a solitary report (Khabar al-Wahid) does not yield knowledge when solitary, it does not yield it when joined to another.' This is similar to what is narrated about Iyas bin Mu'awiyah: That a man said to him: 'What do you say about water?' He said: 'Permissible.' He said: 'And dates?' He said: 'Permissible.' He said: 'So Nabidh is water and dates, so how do you prohibit it?' Iyas said to him:...",

He said: 'No.' He said: 'If I took the water, straw, and dirt, made them into mud (brick), left it to dry, and hit you with it, would I kill you?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Likewise is Nabidh.'\"\nThe meaning of his speech is that the intoxicating power [is] what results from the composition. Likewise, what we are discussing, which intoxicates souls, distracts them, and turns them away from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer, is a power that results from the composition and the social form. The combined sounds in their provocation of souls are not like a single sound. Likewise, the melodious voice which performs singing with a specific rhythm and specific beat, especially with the assistance of instruments of amusement, is not like reciting poetry when stripped of that. Does this doubt circulate on anyone except one weak in knowledge and understanding, having a very deficient share of them?\nIf it is said: What you mentioned regarding the obligation of submission to the rulings of the Sharia, whether the wisdom is known or not, is an obligatory matter about which no Muslim doubts—even if some of them, unfortunately, oppose that in practice, just as no one doubts the obligation of submitting to the prohibition of usury and the like, even if many Muslims deem it permissible in practice, especially in this time. And based on the preceding evidences for the prohibition of singing explained there, one must turn away from it practically and not listen to it. But the question that presents itself—as they say today—is: Has anything been established in the Sharia explaining the wisdom of its prohibition?",

They adapted that from Allah the Exalted naming it {idle talk} (Lahw al-Hadith) in His saying: {And of the people is he who buys the idle talk to mislead [others] from the way of Allah without knowledge and who takes it in ridicule. Those will have a humiliating punishment.} [Luqman: 6]. And that it was revealed regarding singing and the like. So I mention from them what has an established chain to them:\nThe first of them: The Interpreter of the Quran, Abdullah bin Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both). He said: \"It was revealed regarding singing and things like it.\"",
    "foot_note": "1. I say: This is what is authentic from Ibn Abbas. As for what Juwaybir reported from him that it was revealed regarding Al-Nadr bin Al-Harith; that he bought a singing girl and whenever he heard someone wanting Islam, he would take him to his singing girl and say: \"Feed him, give him drink, and sing to him. This is better than what Muhammad calls you to of prayer and fasting and fighting before him,\" as in *Al-Durr* (5/159). I say: It is very weak. This Juwaybir, Al-Daraqutni and others said he is Matruk (abandoned). Similar to it is what Al-Wahidi mentioned in *Asbab al-Nuzul* (p. 259): Al-Kalbi and Muqatil said: \"It was revealed regarding Al-Nadr bin Al-Harith. That is because he used to go out as a merchant to the lands of Persia and buy the news of the non-Arabs, narrate them, and speak to Quraysh with them. He would say to them: 'Muhammad tells you the story of Aad and Thamud, and I tell you the story of Rustam and Isfandiyar and the news of the Chosroes.' So they would find his speech pleasant and leave listening to the Quran. So this verse was revealed regarding them.\" I say: Al-Kalbi and Muqatil are also Matruk and accused of lying, along with the contradiction in their narration to the narration of Juwaybir. Al-Suyuti attributed it to Al-Bayhaqi from Ibn Abbas with similar wording to their narration in *Shu'ab al-Iman*, but it was not facilitated for me to find it there to look into its chain. I do not think it is authentic. Perhaps for that reason, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir, and other verifying Hafizs did not mention it. Rather, Al-Qurtubi indicated its weakness by saying (14/52): \"And it was said: It was revealed regarding Al-Nadr bin Al-Harith...\" Likewise, Al-Zamakhshari said before him (3/210)...",

Thus, his narrating from them casts confidence and reassurance in the soul regarding their narration, because they are a group; so it is very unlikely that they would err in their narration from Ibn Mas'ud, let alone collude to lie against him, as is apparent. And generally, due to their status as Tabi'in, and specifically that they are among Ibrahim's Sheikhs and he narrates from them—especially given that in his biography it states he was a \"critic/exchanger of Hadith\" (Sayrafi al-Hadith) as Al-A'mash said—it is not reasonable at all that he would narrate from them while unsure of their truthfulness and memory. To us, they represent a group by which their anonymity is mended. The statement of Ibn Taymiyyah preceded (page 70) regarding strengthening weak and Mursal Hadith via paths indicates this. For this reason, a group of Imams authenticated the Mursals of Ibrahim, and Al-Bayhaqi specified that to what he narrated as Mursal from Ibn Mas'ud, as in *Marasil Al-Ala'i* (168), and Al-Hafiz confirmed it in *Al-Tahdhib*. This is more general than if he said: \"Abdullah said,\" for it includes if he said: \"From Abdullah.\" It is supported by the fact that there is no apparent difference between the two expressions firstly, and because in neither did he say: \"From a man\" to clear his responsibility, so they are equal in ruling.\nThere is a Hadith—but it is raised (Marfu')—resembling this in that it is from the narration of a group of Tabi'in who were not named, yet some later Hafizs strengthened it because their anonymity was mended by their being a group. It is referenced in *Ghayat al-Maram* (471), so let whoever wishes refer to it.\nAs for the narrator from Ibrahim, Hammad, he is Ibn Abi Sulayman Al-Kufi.

With an important note, which is that the \"Lam\" in His saying, Exalted is He: {Li-yudilla} (to mislead) is the Lam of consequence (Al-Aqibah) as in Al-Wahidi's Tafsir, meaning: so that his affair ends up in misguidance, as Ibn Al-Jawzi said in Al-Zad 6/317. It is not for reasoning (purpose) as some say, although it has validity regarding the disbelievers who take the verses of Allah in ridicule. Therefore, Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, said (1/240):",

    "text": "If this is known, then the people of singing and those who listen to it have a share of this dispraise according to how much they are occupied by singing over the Qur'an, even if they do not attain all of it. For the verses imply the dispraise of one who replaces the Qur'an with the amusement of speech to mislead from the path of Allah without knowledge and takes it in ridicule. And when the Qur'an is recited to him, he turns away arrogantly as if he did not hear it, as if there is deafness in his ears—which is heaviness and deafness—and if he knows anything of it, he mocks it. The total of this does not occur except from the people of greatest disbelief. However, if some of it occurs to the singers and their listeners, they have a portion and a share of this dispraise.\nThis is clarified by the fact that you do not find anyone who cares for singing and listening to musical instruments except that there is misguidance in him regarding the path of guidance, in knowledge and action, and there is a turning away from listening to the Qur'an towards listening to singing. Such that if listening to singing and listening to the Qur'an are presented to him, he turns from this to that, and listening to the Qur'an becomes heavy upon him. Perhaps the situation leads him to silence the reciter and deem his reading too long, while asking the singer to do more and deeming his turn too short. The least that is in this is that he receives a plentiful share of this dispraise, even if he does not acquire all of it.\nThis speech is addressed to those who have some life in their hearts that they can feel. As for the one whose heart has died and whose tribulation has become great, the path of advice is blocked for him. {And whoever Allah wants to put in trial, you will never possess for him [the power to do] anything against Allah. Those are the ones for whom Allah does not intend to purify their hearts. For them in this world is disgrace, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.} [Al-Ma'idah: 41].\n\nI say: From those Salafi narrations and Ibn al-Qayyim's commentary on them with his wonderful and beneficial words, the error of Ibn Hazm becomes clearly apparent to you in his saying, after citing most of them:",

Those will have a humiliating punishment.} This description belongs to one who, if he does it, becomes a disbeliever without dispute if he takes the path of Allah the Exalted in ridicule.\"\n\nSo I say in answering him:\nAs for the first: It is a word of truth by which falsehood is intended, because it implies that the narrations (Athar) contradict what came from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, in interpreting the verse. There is absolutely nothing of that sort. Rather, it contradicts his own rigid interpretation. It suffices the intelligent reader as proof of his error to visualize this fact: The Salafi narrations are on one side, and Ibn Hazm is on the other!\nAs for the second: It is clamor without grinding (noise without substance), for there is no one who opposed them. Had there been any of that, he would have hastened to mention it, as is his habit known to those familiar with his style in refuting his opponents.\nAs for the third: It was addressed in Ibn al-Qayyim's last speech, and it is as if he, may Allah have mercy on him, intended by it to refute this saying of Ibn Hazm. It is very strong and clear. Do you not see that some Muslims today amuse themselves in their gatherings and forums with worldly talk,",

Are these people disbelievers, O Ibn Hazm?\nRather, the stance of these people and their amusement reminds me of the saying of Ibn Abbas and others from the Salaf: \"Disbelief less than [major] disbelief\" (Kufr duna Kufr) (1). So not every disbelief expels one from the Religion (Millah). Therefore, these people and their likes have a share of the dispraise mentioned in the verse, each according to his measure. The famous exegete scholar Ibn Atiyyah al-Andalusi pointed to this meaning in his Tafsir \"Al-Muharrar Al-Wajiz\" 13/19—as if he is also refuting Ibn Hazm—: \"The verse remains applicable in meaning among the Ummah of Muhammad, but not to mislead from the path of Allah through disbelief, nor taking the verses in ridicule, nor does this threat apply to them. Rather, to neglect worship and spend time in what is disliked (Makruh), and to be among the sinners and deficient souls.\"\nI want to draw attention to a contradiction Ibn Hazm fell into. For his mentioned statement in the first point implies that he accepts the establishment of the interpretation of the verse as presented by Ibn Abbas, Ibn Masud, and others; otherwise, he would have hastened to weaken it and would not have said: \"There is no proof for anyone...\" Therefore, in his treatise on Instruments of Diversion (Al-Malahi), he contradicts that completely. For he did not say—firstly—the mentioned statement, and secondly: he explicitly stated the weakening, saying p. 97: \"It is not established from any of his Companions, peace and blessings be upon him.

How could it not be, when the sayings of the Salaf take precedence by agreement over the sayings of the Khalaf (later generations), especially with the abundance of the Salaf and the scarcity of the Khalaf (opposing them)? And how so when most exegetes agree with them, as preceded on p. 144 from Al-Wahidi's Tafsir? It is, as Al-Qurtubi said (14/52): \"The highest thing said regarding this verse.\" And Ibn Masud swore to that by Allah, besides whom there is no other deity, three times that it is singing. And it preceded from Al-Alusi that it has the ruling of being attributed to the Prophet (Marfu').\nSo this truth has no hiddenness... So leave me from the byways (distractions).\nKnow—my Muslim brother—that what confirms, or at least indicates, the wisdom of prohibiting singing is the rule of \"Blocking the Means\" (Sadd al-Dhara'i) which I alluded to when refuting Sheikh Muhammad Abu Zahra and his two students Muhammad Al-Ghazali and Yusuf Al-Qaradawi in the Introduction page 8. Adopting it here is sufficient due to the corruptions and violations that usually result from singing and listening to it.\nThen I saw good, solid speech by Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him, in his book \"Mas'alat al-Sama'\" (The Issue of Listening) applying this rule to this issue of ours. So I loved to entertain the readers with it due to the clarity, proof, and benefit it contains.

For looking at a foreign woman (Ajnabiyyah) and listening to her voice is forbidden as a means of blocking the path (to immorality), and likewise being alone with her.\nThe prohibitions of the Sharia are of two types: A type prohibited because of the corruption within it, and a type prohibited because it is a means to what contains corruption.\nWhoever looks at the form of this prohibition without looking at what it is a means to, will find the reason for its prohibition problematic and will say: What corruption is there in looking at a beautiful image created by Allah the Exalted and made as a sign pointing to Him? And what corruption is there in a melodious voice performed by an instrument or hearing measured speech with a beautiful voice? Is this not like hearing the voices of melodious birds and seeing flowers and pleasant views of amazing buildings, trees, rivers, and the like?\nIt is said to this speaker: The prohibition of this looking at images and these melodious instruments is from the perfection of the Lawgiver's wisdom, the completeness of His Sharia, and His advice to the Ummah. For He prohibited what contains corruptions and what is a means and path to it. Had He permitted the means to corruptions while prohibiting them (the corruptions), it would be a contradiction He is exalted above. If a rational person among rationals prohibited a corruption but permitted the means leading to it, people would consider him foolish and playful and say: He is contradictory.

Is this anything but pure wisdom, mercy, protection for His servants, and shielding them from corruptions, their causes, and their means?\nThe rational person who knows reality knows that the leading of this listening (Sama') to what Allah and His Messenger prohibited, if not greater than the leading of looking (at forbidden things), is not less than it. Rather, often its leading is greater than the leading of wine. For the intoxication of wine, its owner recovers quickly, but the intoxication of listening (to music), its owner does not recover except in the camp of the perished.\"\nI say: Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, spoke the truth. The effect of listening on those afflicted by it is apparent and witnessed as indicated previously. Suffice it for me to mention one example I witnessed myself which embodies in minds the correct meaning of His saying, Exalted is He: {The amusement of speech}. I was in the mosque on Friday listening to the sermon, and beside me was a young man about thirty years old, sitting cross-legged, snapping his fingers on the ground as if listening to a song, dancing his fingers with it. I signaled him to stop and listen to the sermon. This incident is one of many incidents indicating decisively that listening (to music) has blocked its people from the remembrance of Allah—like wine—and from listening to it (the remembrance/Quran). And Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says: {So when the Qur'an is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy.} It is known that the verse includes the Friday sermon as in some narrations, and it is the choice of Ibn Kathir. So amusement has blocked them from the Remembrance and listening to it. And Allah is the One sought for help.",

Therefore, Allah, Blessed and Exalted, made—in the preceding verse—following him, peace and blessings be upon him, excluding others, a proof of Allah's love for him. There is no doubt that whoever Allah loves, Allah is with him in everything, as in the authentic Qudsi Hadith: \"And My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more beloved to Me than what I have obligated upon him. And My servant continues to draw near to Me with voluntary deeds until I love him.

May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?'\nBefore that, he quoted p. 73 from Al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam severe denial of their listening, dancing, and clapping. Then he spoke about their ecstasy (Wajd) and the sayings of scholars regarding it, and are they held accountable for it? He denied it on them because it was not in the era of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Then he returned to addressing what they call 'Tamjid' (Glorification) on minarets and denied it. Then he mentioned the Hadiths on prohibiting musical instruments including Al-Bukhari's Hadith, then mentioned the ruling of sitting in a gathering containing any of that and the sayings of scholars regarding it... Then he said p. 79:\n'Then if you are afflicted with any of that, beware, then beware of believing that doing it or listening to it is an act of nearness as believed by those with no share (in the Hereafter) from the Sufis.

Had using melodious instruments of diversion or listening to them been from the religion and what draws near to the presence of the Lord of the Worlds, he, peace and blessings be upon him, would have explained it and clarified it with complete clarification to his Ummah. He, peace and blessings be upon him, has said: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I have left nothing that brings you closer to Paradise and distances you from the Fire except I commanded you with it, and I have left nothing that brings you closer to the Fire and distances you from Paradise except I forbade you from it.\"' (1).\nHereafter, this is what was facilitated for me to mention of the sayings of famous scholars in denouncing Sufi singing and clarifying that it is a misguided innovation, after we established the prohibition of singing by the Book and Sunnah. Other sayings by others preceded in some previous chapters, like Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah.\nOn this occasion, I must narrate to the readers what happened to me with some imitating students regarding the discussion about this cursed singing. That was half a century ago while I was in my shop in Damascus repairing watches. A customer from the students came to me wearing the embroidered Aghbani turban known in Syria. My attention was drawn to a large envelope he was carrying under his arm. I thought it contained some records for the phonograph box known at that time. When I asked him, he answered as I thought. So I said to him disapprovingly: 'Are you a singer?' He said: 'No, but I listen to singing.' I said: 'Do you not know that it is forbidden by the agreement of the four Imams?'",

He said: 'I sit praising Allah (Tasbih) and remembering Him with the prayer beads in my hand, listening to the singing of Umm Kulthum, so I remember by her sweet voice the voice of the Houris (Hur al-Ain) in Paradise.' So I denied that on him with severe denial. I do not remember now what I said to him after that. But when he returned after a week to take his watch after its repair, a stronger student than him, known from the Association of Scholars (Rabitat Al-Ulama), came with him. He spoke on the subject supporting his friend, excusing him by his good intention. I answered him that good intention does not make the forbidden lawful, let alone making it an act of nearness to Allah. Do you see if a Muslim declared wine drinking lawful claiming to remember the wine of Paradise? And so it is said regarding Zina (adultery) as well. So fear Allah and do not open for people the door of declaring lawful the prohibitions of Allah, rather drawing near to Allah by the slightest tricks. So the man was silenced. This is an example of the effect of Sufi singing.\nWhy do I take the readers far? This Sheikh Al-Ghazali, who became famous as one of the Islamic callers and was given for that a major international Islamic prize, permits the mentioned singing even from Umm Kulthum and Fairuz. When one of the students denounced his listening to Umm Kulthum's song, I think: 'Where is what is called darkness... O companion of the night, where are we?', he answered saying: 'I mean something else' \"p. 75\" Al-Sunnah, meaning his intention is good! Before that, p. 70, he placed the Hadith \"Actions are only by intentions\" in other than",

That is among the many proofs of his ignorance of the Fiqh of Sunnah, because its meaning is: Only righteous actions are (valid/rewarded) by righteous intentions, as the completion of the Hadith indicates (1). This is apparent with the slightest contemplation, but {And he to whom Allah has not granted light - for him there is no light}.\nIn conclusion I say: If there was nothing from the ominousness of Sufi singing except the saying of one of them: \"Listening to singing is more beneficial to the Murid (disciple) than listening to the Qur'an from six or seven aspects,\" it would have been enough! When I read this in Mas'alat Al-Sama' by Ibn al-Qayyim 1/161, I could hardly believe a Muslim would say this, until I saw it in the words of Al-Ghazali (Abu Hamid) in Al-Ihya 2/298, with an absolute expression not restricted to the 'Murid', with deep regret. He confirmed it by posing a question or objection to himself, its summary: \"If the speech of Allah the Exalted is better than singing inevitably, then why do they not gather for the reciter of the Qur'an?\" He answered saying: \"Know that singing is more intensely arousing to ecstasy (Wajd) than the Qur'an from seven aspects...!\" Then he blackened more than two large pages in explaining them. The researcher wonders how that issues from a jurist among the senior Shafi'i jurists, rather one about whom his son said: Hujjat al-Islam (Proof of Islam). Yet his speech in it is very feeble, containing neither knowledge nor Fiqh. That becomes clear from his saying:",

Not every speech agrees with every state. If they gathered in invitations for a reciter, perhaps he recites a verse that does not agree with their state, since the Qur'an is a healing for all people in different states... So then, it is not secure that the recited does not agree with the state and the soul dislikes it, so he is exposed thereby to the danger of disliking the speech of Allah the Exalted from where he finds no way to repel it.. As for the saying of the poet, it is permissible to apply it to other than the intended meaning.. It is obligatory to venerate the speech of Allah and protect it from that. This is what strikes the mind regarding the reasons for the turning away of the Sheikhs to listening to singing instead of listening to the Qur'an.\"\nI say: Allah is Greatest! The flood has reached the high grounds (the matter has reached a crisis point). The calamity has magnified. It was restricted to the Murids (disciples) in the previous quote of Ibn al-Qayyim, and suddenly Al-Ghazali declares that it is in the Sheikhs as well, and defends them with that cold reasoning whose narration suffices against refuting it. And Allah is the One sought for help.\nIf this Al-Ghazali declares that the Qur'an is a healing for all people in different states, then what do we have to do with the 'Ecstasy' (Wajd) for the sake of which the Sufis justified turning away from listening to the Qur'an? The Ecstasy whose best state is that its owner is overcome by it like sneezing for example, and its worst is that it is showing off and hypocrisy. Where are they from the saying of the Exalted in the Qur'an: {Say, \"It is, for those who believe, a guidance and cure.\" And those who do not believe - upon their ears is deafness, and it is upon them blindness}?

    "text": "A Word on Islamic Anasheed (Nasheeds):\nThis, and a final word remains with me with which I conclude this beneficial treatise, Allah the Exalted willing. It is about what they call \"Islamic or Religious Anasheed\". I say:\nIt has become clear from Chapter Seven what is permissible to sing of poetry and what is not permissible. Just as it became clear from what preceded it the prohibition of all instruments of diversion except the daff in Eid and Wedding for women. And from this last chapter, that it is not permissible to draw near to Allah except through what Allah legislated. So how can it be permissible to draw near to Him with what He prohibited? And that for this reason, scholars prohibited Sufi singing and their denial intensified against those who declared it lawful.\nIf the reader recalls these strong principles in his mind, it becomes clear to him with all clarity that there is no difference in terms of ruling between Sufi singing and Religious Anasheed. Rather, there might be in this (Anasheed) another calamity, which is that they might be composed to the melodies of immoral songs and performed according to musical rules, Eastern or Western, which delight the listeners, make them dance, and take them out of their composure. So the intent becomes the melody and the delight (Tarab), not the Nasheed itself. This is a new violation, which is imitation of the disbelievers and the immoral.\nAnother violation might result from that, which is imitating them in their turning away from the Qur'an and abandoning it. So they enter into the generality of the Prophet's complaint, peace and blessings be upon him, about his people as in the saying of the Exalted: {And the Messenger has said, \"O my Lord, indeed my people have taken this Qur'an as [a thing] abandoned.\".}\nI remember well that when I was in Damascus - two years before my emigration to here, Amman - some Muslim youth began to sing some Anasheed with sound meaning, intending by that to counter Sufi singing with the likes of the poems of Al-Busiri and others. They recorded that on a tape. It did not take long until they coupled with it beating on the daff. Then they used it at first in wedding parties on the basis that the daff is permissible in them.

That became their solace and their constant habit. That is only from the dominance of desire and ignorance of Satan's plots. So he diverted them from caring for the Qur'an and hearing it, let alone studying it, and it became abandoned by them as came in the noble Verse.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Kathir said in its Tafsir 3/317: \"The Exalted says informing about His Messenger and Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: {O my Lord, indeed my people have taken this Qur'an as [a thing] abandoned.} That is because the polytheists did not listen to the Qur'an nor pay attention to it, as the Exalted said: {And those who disbelieved said, \"Do not listen to this Qur'an and speak noisily during [the recitation of] it...\"} the Verse. So when the Qur'an was recited to them, they would increase clamor and speech in other things so they would not hear it. This is from abandoning it. Leaving faith in it and leaving believing in it is from abandoning it. Leaving pondering it and understanding it is from abandoning it. Leaving acting upon it and complying with its commands and avoiding its prohibitions is from abandoning it. Turning away from it to other things like poetry, speech, singing, amusement, talk, or a method taken from other than it is from abandoning it.\"\nSo we ask Allah, the Generous, the Bestower, the Able to do what He wills, to purify us from what angers Him and use us in what pleases Him of memorizing His Book, understanding it, and undertaking its requirements throughout the night and ends of the day in the manner He loves and is pleased with. Indeed, He is Generous, Bestower.\nThis is the last of what Allah, Blessed and Exalted, facilitated to draft of this treatise. May Allah benefit His servants with it. That was in the late afternoon of Friday, the twenty-eighth of Jumada Al-Akhirah, year 1415 AH. And Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.
