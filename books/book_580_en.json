    "text": "Introduction. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah who made satisfaction for lovers in the rulings of passion, and endeared death to them in the love of those they desire; so do not be, O young man, objecting with blame. For how many among them are a lover and a truthful admirer: He saw, so he loved, so he sought union, but they refused... So he sought patience, but attaining it exhausted him, so he passed away. I praise Him with the praise of one who feared the station of his Lord and forbade the soul from desire, and composed poetry mentioning his beloved, whether Tihami in Hijaz or Shami in distance: A mount of faith if you meet a Yemeni... And if you meet a Ma'addi, then Adnani. And I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, the Praiseworthy, the Glorious; a testimony of one whose death due to his distance has become closer than the jugular vein, and who said to his blamer: You have known that we have no right to your daughters, and indeed you know what we want: If what ailed me was from a veiled beloved... I would be excused, but it is from a turbaned beloved. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger; a testimony of one who was sincere in his allegiance and absolved himself of sin when his beloved turned away from him, with the seal of his Lord and his innocence. May Allah bless him and his family and companions, those whom He loves and who love Him, and who stop at what He commanded them and do not transgress it, as long as a sun rises and a lover wanders. As for what follows, this book of ours is as it was said: A book containing the news of those killed by passion, and travelled with them in love in every doctrine. Its stanzas are like connected ropes, wherein one never ceases to compose poetry about Al-Rabab and Zaynab. They are what they are; you know them by their marks. Passion has left them like the dry stubble of the enclosure builder. They have become, due to the illness of intense love, of two types: some of them have fulfilled their vow (died), and some of them are waiting. They are between slain and martyred, and wretched and happy, despite the difference of their classes and forms, and the variance of their ranks and conditions, and other things by which its leaves become ripe with fruit, and its pages become such that on every side of its face is a moon. So if you look at existence in its entirety, you witness all beings as beautiful. However, a group of contemporaries have overcome those who preceded in authoring in this chapter, and most of them did not distinguish in their poetry between Zaynab and Al-Rabab: And everyone claims connection to Laila... But Laila does not acknowledge that for them. So the quarter of this book of ours is flooded with the mention of the Ameriyyah (Laila), and regarding what Shihab Mahmud authored, it is thanked. Whoever reads it knows the correctness of this statement. And recited to me in verification of this claim: If Hitham speaks, believe her. The author of 'Tawq al-Hamama' (The Ring of the Dove) relative to his partridge hops, and the author of 'Manazil al-Ahbab' (The Dwellings of the Loved Ones) is among those who knew the place but stayed short of the house. 'And I excused your phantom in its harshness... It travels by night but morning comes whilst it is stages away from us.' Another regarding 'Ya Daraha' (Oh her house) in the Khafif meter: Indeed, her visiting place... is near, but before that are terrors. If you say the merit belongs to the predecessor, and 'Did the poets leave anything to be patched?', I say yes: In wine there is a meaning not found in grapes, and the most beautiful thing in the peacock is the tail. So leave every voice after my voice, for I am the imitated cry and the other is the echo. How much the first left for the last! And there is no consideration for the saying of the poet: 'Transfer your heart wherever you wish among desires... Love is only for the first lover. How many a home on earth the young man acts familiar with... But his longing is ever for the first home.' For he has failed in his argument, and it was said in response to him: 'Take pride in the last one you were tasked to love... There is no good in the first lover. Do you doubt that the Prophet Muhammad... Mastered creation while being the last messenger?' Dik al-Jinn al-Homsi said, refuting Habib (Abu Tammam) in his aforementioned statement: 'Those who spoke of passion lied... There is no doubt in it for the first lover. Why should I yearn for a desolate ruin... Whose landmarks have been erased as if it was never inhabited?' So Habib said when he heard the saying of Dik al-Jinn mentioned: 'Those who conjectured in their saying lied... Love is only for the future lover. Is what you have tasted of food... tastier, or the taste of what has not yet been eaten?' So Dik al-Jinn said again when this saying of Habib reached him: 'Turn away from the old, first love... And stick to the resumed, future one. Transfer your heart wherever you wish, for you will not see... Like a new passion or a future union.' Abu al-Barq spoke and took the path of fairness between them, and his saying must be acknowledged because he spoke best where he said: 'They added to the meaning, so everyone is a doer of good... And the truth in it is a saying not ignored. Love is for the beloved at the hour of his union... Love in it is not for a last nor for a first.'",

    "text": "However, I did not deny what is in 'Manazil al-Ahbab' regarding the mention of a beloved and a home, nor did I bear prejudice against its author—oh wonder at my bearing heart! But I intended to alert that good composition is a gift, and people have schools of thought regarding what they adore. It is known that madness has arts, and every party rejoices in what they have. This book of ours remained in its drafts for years, and its verses in their meters were in depths; I did not permit the 'dwellings of the loved ones' within it to any dweller, nor did I enable a lover to pass by those places: 'I become jealous if I hear a moan in the tribe... cautious and fearful that it might be for his love.' Until the Noble Decree of the King Al-Nasir—may Allah perpetuate the spreading of his banners and never empty a quiver of his arrows as long as the decrees of the arrows of the eyes are effective and the stature of the beloved by whom time has become pleasant and moderate bends—came out requesting it. So I hastened to prepare it and cast its pure gold according to the Decree and the Noble Metal without delay or affectation. I did not permit the flowers of its prose to any of the people other than his Noble Presence, because it used to be said: 'Everything suitable for the Master is forbidden to the slave.' No wonder it came, with his happy gaze, a delight for the sight. The one standing at his threshold said that happiness indeed glances at the stone. It is a garden for the Sultan, a solace for the lover, a compatible companion for the truthful admirer, a high ground for the abandoned, a coffee for the drinking companion, a reminder for the forgetful, an insight for the blind, the verse of the poem for the excellent poet, a proverb for the skilled writer, stories for the narrator, choking grief for the envious, an alert for the jurist, and a simile for the beloved with the moon: 'His initiatives hasten to him with the full moon... And his anecdotes are sweet to him upon passing. In it, for him every day and night... is a visiting beloved or a companion conversing at night. I have verse in it, if its fragrance spreads... Within its fold is sweet speech and rare. I have prose in it that became in his station... And the scent of its light is the fragrance of the radiant garden. I have in it from the magic of expression letters... If the fawn-eyed one, his magic, treats me harshly. I have in it the secrets of letters because... My tears dot it, so its secrets appear. The scattering of my tears is like the arrangement of its lines... My cheeks when his notebooks are written on them. The pens of his guidance extend the ink of tears... So my tears are my ink and the blackness is his inkwells. I served in the Diwan al-Sababa (Register of Ardent Love) as a worker... So his glance undertook my killing from my sleep. Were it not for passion, a lover like me would not have died... Nor would his graveyards have been populated by the Ameri (Majnun). And in my ghazal (love poetry) is the mention of the gazelle and a quarter... Even the wild calves are flown by the conversation in it. I elevate it above the description of Unayzah's howdah... And a desolate wasteland from which her camels marched. Its rhymes drag high meanings by which... Jarir became like a slave shackled by his crimes. The temples of Al-Walid turn grey because of it... As it travels while the wing of the night has black braids. I do not see a day at Darat Juljul... Except a poet upon whom misfortunes turned. If the mention of a beloved and a home is forgotten... Then I, for the one I love, will remain a rememberer as long as I live. I neighbor neighbors at the foot of Al-Muqattam... Oh how excellent is the beloved when you neighbor him. O phantom of the one I love, if my eye dozes off... Do you abandon him, by Allah, or are you visiting him? By your right, if you traveled with him for part of a night... You would have traveled with caravans marching in love. Oh pride of a phantom from your imagination knocking... So he lowers his head in reverence as if you were present. I have one whom the branch goes on pilgrimage to the spear of her stature... If she spends the night in the fresh garden with her look. If she is kissed on the jewelry and perfume, it is said to me... Your beloved is a garden whose flowers diffuse scent. If I sought from her, while she is angry, a turn... She bent her affections towards the gazelle consulting him. Does what I suffer from the heat of her abandonment cool down... While her mid-day heats have intensified against me one day? I fortified myself in the fortress of passion against my blamers... And an army of worry spent the night besieging my heart. If my blamer were not blind of insight... His eyes would not have been blind to whom I loved. He compares her to the branch, while the branch, when with her... Witnesses her, lowers its eyes, and casts down its gaze. Does the branch have a cheek like the anemone when it appears... And hair like the wing of night, its braids black?",

    "text": "If my humiliation in her love is pleasant, then I am... By your right, made victorious by one who is mighty in Egypt. A king who shakes the spear of his stature's sides... As a branch shakes, flying in love. A king, you show him before it happened, that it is existing... His insight is double what his eyes see. He is close to you if you come to him, good in meeting... Glorious of countenance, excelling in beauty, dazzling. A king, if he becomes like the full moon in the darkness... Then his children are like the stars traveling with him. A king, around whom I see every scholar... Mentioning in knowledge what he mentions. A king, who has for every day and guardian... A bringer of glad tidings, whose tidings follow in succession with congratulations. A king, whom the lions of the forest fear his might... Because the kings of the earth all fear him. The meteors of the sky and its lightning frighten them... And they are but his tawny spears and his sharp swords. If you opened the forms of the state of their gathering... Then which conscience did not hide its secret in it? Which brave men did not fear his combat in its sea... And which place did not have his pulpits ascend it? And which poem in its sea did not please him... While the diver of my thought is the arranger of the pearls, scattering them? I have in it five of the best compositions... And this one, Tawq al-Hamama (Ring of the Dove), is the tenth. The prose diffuses scent in it like flowers when... The east wind alternates and comes early to it. How many a dancer I have in it around a singer... By his erotic poetry in the tribe, his flute player delights. If it were not like the Sugardan (Sugar bowl), it would not become... In his presence one day, its civilizations pleasant. Yes, I authored it in the name of our Master the Sultan in the... explained manner, and undertook its work myself for his sake, so it came as was said, a work... ... .... ... ... ... Spirit to Spirit. I wander in love with whom the beloved wandered in love... Oh, wonder at this chained passion. I followed in its composition brevity... And restriction to short anecdotes, because it used to be said: Fabrication is of two types... A fabrication that has pride and a fabrication that has origin. Yahya bin Khalid said to his son: 'Write the best of what you hear, memorize the best of what you write, speak with the best of what you memorize, and take a part of everything, for whoever is ignorant of a thing is an enemy to it.' I named it 'Diwan al-Sababa' (Register of Ardent Love) so that the one who stands upon it becomes enamored and knows that if I am not for ardent love, who is for it: 'No one knows longing except the one who endures it... Nor ardent love except the one who suffers it.' Yes, by Allah, rarely does the obedient to his passion leave... Sufficing as one of ardent love and madness.",

    "text": "I arranged it into an Introduction, thirty Chapters, and a Conclusion. As for the Introduction, it is regarding the definition of Ishq (Passionate Love), its derivation, what has been said about its mark and description, its causes, signs, ranks, names, praise and dispraise, and the mention of people's disagreement on whether it is voluntary or involuntary, and similar matters.

Chapter 28: On the mention of a small portion of the News of Excellent Singers among men and beauties, and what carries that meaning regarding mentioning their Mawwals and describing their instruments. Chapter 29: On the mention of those afflicted in this time with the love of women and boys. Chapter 30: On the mention of those characterized by Chastity with the best descriptions. As for the Conclusion, it is on the mention of those who died of their love and came to their Lord, rich and poor, great and small, despite their different types and varying quests. For the sake of mentioning them, I established the foundations of this book and entered it from a door and exited from a door. From here we begin mentioning what brings comfort like fans of coarse linen, and serves upon reading like the vanguard for the army. This Introduction is regarding the description of Ishq, its mark, its praise and dispraise, and the mention of people's disagreement on whether it is voluntary or involuntary. It includes five sections: Section One: The Definition of Love, its mark, and what has been said regarding its name. I say: We established this section to mention the definition of Love and its boundaries, the ebb and flow of its crashing sea, and the differing speech and contrasting sayings people have about it. For among them are those who were confused and named it by the name of its cause or by the name of what it leads to of error, and other things in which the answer and hitting the truth were confused for them. Their apparent excuse is the saying of the poet: 'People say: If only you described Passion to us... By Allah, I do not know how to describe it to them. For there is no limit to define any part of it... Nor is there a timed time for any part of it.'",

    "text": "Among its beautiful definitions and correct descriptions is the saying of Pythagoras, who took from the companions of Solomon son of David, peace be upon them both, as mentioned by Sa'id in the Book of Classes: 'Love is greed that is generated in the heart, moves and grows, then breeds. Materials of eagerness gather to it, and whenever it strengthens, its owner increases in agitation, persistence, continuation in greed, thought, wishes, and eagerness for the quest, until that leads him to disturbing grief. The burning of the blood at that point is by the transformation of black bile (melancholy) or the inflammation of yellow bile and its turning into it. It is the nature of black bile to corrupt thought, leading to loss of reason, hoping for what cannot be, and wishing for what cannot be completed, until that leads to madness. At that point, the lover might kill himself, or die of grief, or look at his beloved and die of joy, or gasp a gasp so his soul suffocates and he remains for twenty-four hours, so they think he died and bury him while he is alive. Or he might sigh deeply so his soul suffocates in the pericardium of his heart, and the heart closes over it and does not open until he dies. You see him, if he remembers the one he loves, his blood flees and his color changes.' Imam Ibn the Imam Muhammad bin Dawud al-Zahiri said repeatedly: 'If that is so, then the removal of the hateful thing from one in this state has no way through the management of medicines, and there is no cure for him.' In a copy, Fazari said: 'Except by the kindness of the Lord of the Worlds. That is because the hateful thing occurring from a single cause standing by itself can be managed by removing its cause. But if two causes occur, and each one is a cause—so if black bile is a cause for continuous thought, and continuous thought is a cause for the burning of blood and yellow bile and their turning into strengthening the black bile—then this is the incurable disease which doctors are unable to treat.' Among them is the saying of Plato, who took wisdom from the aforementioned Pythagoras: 'Love is an instinctual force generated from the whispers of the ambitious and the ghosts of imagination, growing by the connection of the natural structure, creating boldness for the brave and courage for the coward. It clothes every human with the opposite of his nature until it reaches the psychological illness and longing madness, leading him to the incurable disease for which there is no cure.' Among them is the saying of Aristotle, who took wisdom from the aforementioned Plato: 'Love is the blindness of the lover to the faults of the beloved.' This is like his saying (the Prophet), peace be upon him: 'Your love for a thing blinds and deafens.' And the saying of the poet: 'I do not see the fault of a friend at all... Nor some of what is in him when I am satisfied. The eye of satisfaction is blunt to every fault... But the eye of discontent reveals defects.' And the saying of another: 'The eye of discontent sees every fault... And the eye of the brother of satisfaction is blind to that.' Among them is what Abu Ali Ibn Sina and other doctors followed: 'Love is an obsessive disease resembling melancholia, which a person brings upon himself by focusing his thought on the approval of certain forms and figures. It may be accompanied by sexual desire, or it may not.' Some witty literati said: 'Love is an expression for seeking that specific act from a specific person.' This is witty. Al-Junayd said: 'Love is a Merciful intimacy and a longing inspiration which the Generosity of Allah Almighty obligated upon every possessor of a soul, to obtain the Greatest Pleasure which cannot be matched except by that intimacy. It exists in souls according to the ranks of their owners. No one is without love for a matter by which the extent of his class among creation is indicated. For that reason, the noblest ranks in the world were the ranks of those who renounced it despite it being visible, and inclined towards the Hereafter despite it being reported to them in the form of words.' Al-Asma'i said: 'I asked a Bedouin woman about Love. She said: It is too majestic to be seen and hidden from the eyes of mankind. It is latent in the chests like the latency of fire in stone; if you strike it, it ignites, and if you leave it, it hides.' Some said: 'Madness has arts, and Love is one of its arts.' He argued with the saying of Qays (Majnun): 'They said: You became mad with whom you desire. I said to them... Love is greater than what is with madmen. Love—its companion never recovers forever... While the madman is struck down only at times. I have become mad, so bring the one I became mad with... If she can negate my madness, do not blame me.'",

    "text": "It was said to Abu Zuhayr al-Mada'ini: 'What is Love?' He said: 'Madness and humiliation, and it is the disease of the witty folk.' It was said to Abu Wa'il al-Awdahi: 'What do you say about Love?' He said: 'If it is not a part of madness, it is the extract of magic.' A Bedouin woman said: 'It is the movement of the static and the calming of the moving.' Al-Ma'mun said to Yahya bin Aktham: 'What is Love?' He said: 'Occurrences that occur to a man, so his heart wanders with them and his soul prefers them.' Thumamah said to him: 'Silence, O Yahya! You only have to answer in a matter of divorce or a pilgrim in Ihram hunting game. As for this, it is one of our matters.' Al-Ma'mun said to him: 'Speak, O Thumamah.' He said: 'Love is an enjoyable companion, a comforting intimate, a possessing friend, and a conquering king. A king whose paths are subtle, whose doctrines are obscure, and whose judgments are unjust. He possessed bodies and their souls, hearts and their thoughts, eyes and their gazes, and intellects and their opinions. He has been given the rein of their obedience, the power of their disposal, and the leadership of their kingdom. His entrance is hidden from eyes, and his path is blinded from hearts.' Al-Ma'mun said to him: 'You have done well, O Thumamah,' and ordered a thousand dinars for him. This amount is sufficient in knowing Love and its definition. Section Two: Its Causes and Signs. I say: We established this section to speak on the psychological causes of Love and its physical signs, although this latter type is numerous and the lovers characterized by it are a large multitude. We will present of that what is sweet to arrive at and for which its banners flutter like the heart of a lover, God willing. Some doctors said: The cause of psychological Love is approval (Istihsan) and thought. Its physical cause is the rising of a bad vapor to the brain from retained semen; therefore, it mostly afflicts bachelors, and frequent intercourse removes it quickly. Ibn al-Akfani said in his book 'Ghunyat al-Labib inda Ghaybat al-Tabib' (Sufficiency of the Intelligent in the Absence of the Doctor) that eating hearing birds inherits Love. He also said in 'Al-Khulasah': Its sign is thinness of the body, hollowness of the eyelid due to sleeplessness and the abundance of vapors rising to it, sunkenness of the eye and its dryness except when weeping, and a smiling movement of the eyelid as if looking at something delightful. Also, breath that is frequently interrupted and recovered, deep sighing, and an irregular pulse, especially when mentioning different names and descriptions; whichever one causes the irregularity of the pulse and change of face to intensify, that is it (the beloved). Aristotle the Astrologer said: Love belongs to the stars Saturn, Mercury, and Venus together. Therefore, if they share in the origin of the birth or gather and correspond in praiseworthy forms, love and affection occur between them in the house of one of them or in his limit, and the lord of the house or the owner of the limit is looking at it, or the mentioned planets are looking in praiseworthy forms or are conjunctions. Saturn prepares thought, wishing, greed, worry, agitation, sorrows, obsession, and madness. Mercury prepares poetry composition, arranging letters, flattery, licentiousness, embellishing speech, abasement, and gentleness. Venus prepares for Love, infatuation, wandering, and tenderness, and incites the soul to enjoy looking, intimacy in conversation, and flirtation which incites lust and arousal, and calls to mirth and listening to songs and what resembles it. Ptolemy said: Its cause is that the sun and moon are in one sign or corresponding in trine or sextile. Whenever it is so, they are naturally disposed to mutual affection because their lots of fortune in their births are in one sign, or the two lots correspond in trine or sextile, provided the lord of the lot of love and friendship looks on. That indicates that these two newborns, their love is from the aspect of benefit, and their benefit is from one direction. If one of them benefits from the affection of his companion, the benefit brings about love and affection between them and they mix. This is supported by the saying of Al-Khayarzi: 'But the souls of lovers meet... If the bodies are asleep away from them. And I consider our two souls originally one... But it is divided between us. Were this not so, my soul would not feel pain... For him in the unseen when he is in pain.' Among its signs is the lover lowering his gaze when his beloved looks at him and casting his glance towards the ground; that is out of awe of him, shyness from him, and his greatness in his chest. For this reason, kings disapprove of one who addresses them while staring sharply at them; rather, he should be lowering his gaze to the ground. Allah Almighty said, informing about the perfection of the manners of His Prophet, peace be upon him, on the Night of Isra: 'The sight did not swerve, nor did it transgress.' This is the utmost manners, for the sight did not swerve right nor left, nor did it aspire beyond what was there. Among them is a disturbance that appears to the lover upon seeing someone who resembles his beloved or upon hearing his name, as was said: 'A caller called while we were at Al-Khayf in Mina... So he stirred the sorrows of the heart while not knowing. He called by the name of Laila someone else, so it was as if... He flew with Laila a bird that was in my chest. He called by the name of Laila—may Allah heat his eye... While Laila is in the land of Sham in a desolate country.'",

    "text": "Among them is that he requests to hear the name of his beloved and delights in speaking about his news. He loves the family of his beloved, his relatives, his servants, his neighbors, and whoever lives with him, as the poet said: 'O dwellers of the banks of the Tigris, all of you... To the heart, for the sake of the beloved, are beloved.' Another said: 'I love, for her love, the black people until... I love, for her love, the black dogs.' Among them is his excessive jealousy over him, love of killing and death to reach his satisfaction, listening to his speech if he speaks, finding everything he brings strange even if it is the essence of absurdity, believing him even if he lies, agreeing with him even if he wrongs, testifying for him even if he is unjust, following him however he proceeds, hastening to walk towards the place where he is, intentionally sitting near him and approaching him, casting aside busying matters that distract from him, asceticism regarding them and desiring away from them, underestimating every grave matter calling for separation from him, slowing down in walking when leaving him, and being generous with everything he can of what he used to enjoy before that, as if it is gifted to him. This is before the fire of love ignites. If it becomes established, he turns away from all that and replaces it with asking and begging as if he takes it from the beloved, to the point that he sacrifices himself for his beloved, just as the Companions used to sacrifice themselves for the Prophet, peace be upon him, in war until they fell around him, as was said: 'A lover ransoms you with his soul, if he had... Something dearer than his soul, he would ransom you with it.' Among them is excessive expanding joy, cramming in a wide place, fighting over something one of them takes, frequent hidden winking, leaning, intentionally touching the hand during conversation, touching what is possible of the visible limbs, and drinking what the beloved left in the vessel. I say: Among them is kissing his sandal in his absence. I have seen one who did this, so I reprimanded him for it. He said: 'Silence, O so-and-so, you do not know the pleasure in this.' Then I found this mentioned person in Mecca, and he sent a letter with me to his mentioned beloved because he was staying there (Mujawir). I said to him: 'How was patience possible, O Zaid, from Amr?' He recited: 'By Allah, I have a side I do not waste... And for amusement and licentiousness, I have a side.' Among them is kissing the wall of the house, as was said: 'I kiss this wall and that wall... I pass by the dwellings, the dwellings of Laila. It is not the love of dwellings that enraptured my heart... But the love of the one who dwelled in the dwellings.' Among them is the agreement occurring between the lover and the beloved, especially if the love is a love of resemblance and suitability. Often the beloved speaks words or wants to speak them, and the lover speaks the exact same words. Often the lover falls ill due to the illness of his beloved. I say: This happened more than once to Sultan Al-Malik Al-Nasir Ahmad when he was in Karak with his beloved Al-Shuhaib; he would fall ill for his illness and recover for his health. I was told this by one whose word I do not doubt among those who were in his service attending him. As for the occurrence of this for the predecessors, it is frequent. Of that is what is told about Abu Nuwas, that he fell ill, and some of his friends entered to visit him and found him slightly better. He said: 'Be at ease with us,' and said: 'Where did you come from?' We said: 'From Anan, the slave girl of Al-Natiqi.' He said: 'Was she ill?' We said: 'Yes, and she has recovered now.' He said: 'By Allah, I denied this illness of mine and did not know a cause for it, other than I imagined that it was due to an illness that befell some of whom I love. I have found relief this day, so I rejoiced hoping that Allah healed him from it before me.' Then he called for his inkwell and wrote to Anan: 'I developed a fever and did not feel your fever... Until my visitors spoke of your complaint. So I said: The fever would not have visited me... Without a cause, except for your fever. And a trait in which I was not accused... Allah healed me from it when He healed you. Until my soul and your soul agreed in... This and that, and in this and that.'",

    "text": "Among them is that if asked about a matter, he answers with the opposite. Excessive yawning, stretching, and laziness if he looks at his beloved. Scratching the ground with his big toe. This happens often to women. Biting her lower lip, striking her upper arms or breasts, revealing her beauties to the one she desires, making him imagine she sees that for some of her family, looking at her sides, and placing speech out of context—'I mean you, so listen, O neighbor.' Among them is submission to the beloved in all that he chooses of good and evil. If the beloved is fond of knowledge, the lover strives in seeking it more intensely than his striving. If he is fond of anecdotes, good stories, and pleasant news, the lover exaggerates in seeking and memorizing them. If he is fond of a craft or industry, he strives to learn it if possible. The beneficial love is that a person falls upon a complete love that carries him by his love to seek perfection. The calamity, the whole calamity, is that a person is afflicted with the love of an empty, idle person, void of all good, so his love carries him to resemble him. In the news of lovers, a lover loved trousers (Sirwal) because of the trousers of his beloved, so twelve loads and a sack of trousers were found in his estate; Al-Saymari mentioned it. Another loved mortars (Hawun) because of the sound of his beloved's mortar, so ten thousand of them were found in his estate. I have come across many things of this sort; madness has arts. Section Three: Its Ranks and Names. I say: We established this section to mention the ranks of love, its context, its names, and its derivation according to different languages and the agreement of its narrators. It is known that if a thing was great among the Arabs and its importance grave—like the lion, the spear, wine, the sword, the calamity, and burning love, and what makes you know what it is—they placed many names for it and their care for it was famous. Nothing equals their care for Love which steals the core (intellect). The first of its ranks is Hawa (Desire/Air), which is the inclination of the soul. It may be used to mean the beloved himself. The poet said: 'Indeed, she who claimed your heart got bored of her... Was created as your desire (Hawa) just as desire was created for her.' Then 'Alaqah (Attachment), which is the love adhering to the heart, as the poet said: 'I wanted patience away from you, but hindered me... An attachment ('Alaq) in my heart from your love, old.' It was named 'Alaqah for the heart's hanging onto the beloved. Then Kalaf (Infatuation), which is the intensity of love. Its origin is from Kulfa, which is hardship. It is said 'Kallafahu taklifan' if he ordered him with what is hard for him. It is as if the beloved tasks the lover with what he cannot bear, ignoring His saying Almighty: 'Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.' It was said it is taken from the 'Kalf' (freckle/mark), which is something that appears on the face like sesame seeds. Kalaf is also a color between blackness and redness, which is a murky redness. Then Ishq (Passionate Love), which is a name for what exceeds the amount called Hubb (Love). In 'Al-Sahah', Ishq is excessive love. According to doctors, it is among the types of Melancholia. The meaning of Melancholia is the change of assumptions and thought from the natural course to corruption. This is the matter of these names. The Arabs rarely pronounced it (Ishq); as if they covered its name and alluded to it with these names. They hardly explicitly mentioned it, nor do you hardly find it in their ancient poetry. Rather, the later ones became fond of it. This word did not occur in the Quran nor in the Sunnah except in the Hadith of Ibn Dawud al-Zahiri as will be explained. Ibn Sidah said: Ishq is the lover's admiration of the beloved; it is in the violence of love and its terror. It was said: 'Ishq' is the noun and 'Ashaq' is the source. 'Ashiq' is one with much love. A woman is 'Ashiq' (lover). And a tree is called... It was said 'Ashiqa' (Ivy/Bindweed) turns green then becomes thin and small. Al-Zajjaji said the derivation of 'Ashiq' is from that. Al-Farra said: Ishq is a sticky plant, so the love a man has for his wife was named Ishq for its sticking to the heart.",

    "text": "Ibn al-A'rabi said: The 'Ashiqa' is the Lablab (Ivy); it turns green and yellow and clings to whatever tree is next to it. 'Al-Ashiq' (The Lover) was derived from that. Mentioned in Diwan al-Ashiqin. 'Ashiq' is used for the doer (lover) and the object (beloved). The plural of Ashiq is 'Ishq' and 'Ushaq'. It is said regarding a woman 'Ashiqa' and also a woman 'Ashiq' (masculine form), and that has been mentioned previously. Allah knows best. Then Shaghaf (Enamoredness). Al-Azizi said in 'Gharib al-Quran': 'Shaghafaha hubban' (he inspired her with love) means his love hit the pericardium (Shaghaf) of her heart. The Shaghaf is the covering of the heart. It is said it is the kernel of the heart, which is a black clot in its core. 'Shaghafaha hubban' means his love rose to the highest place in her heart, derived from 'Shaghaf al-Jibal', meaning their peaks. Their saying 'So-and-so is Mashghuf' means love took him to the furthest extents. As for Sha'af (Infatuation) with the undotted 'Ayn', it is the burning of the heart by love. He said in 'Al-Sahah': 'Sha'afahu al-hubb', meaning it burned his heart. It has been read both ways: 'Shaghafaha hubban' and 'Sha'afaha'. Likewise is Law'ah (Anguish) and La'ij (Burning). I mean like Shaghaf in burning. La'ij is an active participle from their saying 'The blow la'ajahu' if it pained him and burned his skin. It is said 'Hawa La'ij' for the burning of the heart from love. In 'Al-Sahah', 'Law'at al-Hubb' is its burning. So this is the Burning Desire. Then Jawa (Ardency), which is the inner desire. In 'Al-Sahah', Jawa is the burning and intensity of emotion (Wajd) from passionate love or grief. Then Tatayyum (Enslavement by Love), which is that love enslaves him. From it 'Taym Allah' was named, meaning Servant of Allah. From it is said a man is 'Mutayyam'. Then Tabl (Sickness by Love), which is that desire makes him ill. From it a man is 'Matbul'. In 'Al-Sahah', 'Tabalahum al-dahr' and 'atbalahum' if it annihilated them. Then Tadlah (Bewilderment), which is the loss of reason from desire. It is said 'Dallahahu al-hubb', meaning it bewildered him. Then Huyam (Wandering), which is that he goes on his face due to the overwhelming desire upon him. From it a man is 'Ha'im'. 'Al-Hiyam' with Kasra is thirsty camels, and a people 'Him', meaning thirsty. Sababa (Ardent Love) is the tenderness of longing and its heat. Maqah is Love, and Wamiq is the Lover. Wajd (Emotion/Passion) and Husran (Grief/Regret), and mostly it is used in grief. Danaf (Emaciation/Sickness) is hardly used by the Arabs regarding love; rather the later ones became fond of it. The Arabs used it regarding illness. Shajw (Anxiety) is love followed by worry and sadness. Shawq (Longing) is the travel of the heart to the beloved. He said in 'Al-Sahah': Shawq and Ishtiyaq are the soul's yearning for a thing. It came in the Sunnah: 'And I ask You for the gaze upon Your Noble Face and the longing (Shawq) for meeting You.' It was disputed regarding Shawq: does it vanish with union or increase? A group said it vanishes because it is the travel of the heart to the beloved, so if it reaches him, the journey ends, so it throws down its staff and the distance settles with it. Just as the traveler is delighted by the return. A group said: Rather, it increases. They argued with the saying of the poet: 'And the greatest that love is one day... Is when the tents draw near to the tents.' They said: Now Shawq is the burning of love and the inflammation of its fire in the heart of the lover, and that is something which nearness and connection increase. The correct view is that the Shawq occurring at meeting and connection is different from the type that was during absence from the beloved. Ibn al-Rumi said: 'I embrace her while the soul is still longing... For her; is there closeness after the embrace? And I kiss her mouth so my ardency may vanish... But the wandering I suffer intensifies. It is as if my heart's thirst is not quenched... Except by seeing the two souls mix.' Balbal (Anxiety) is worry and the whispering of the chest. Balabil is the plural of Balbalah. It is said 'Balabil al-Shawq', meaning its whisperings. Tabarih (Hardships) are severities and calamities. It is said 'Barraha bihi al-Hubb wal-Shawq' if the Barh (Hardship) afflicted him from it, which is severity. Ghamrah (Flood/Overwhelming) is what overwhelms the heart of love, drunkenness, or negligence. Shajan (Sadness/Need) is the need wherever it is, and the lover's need is strongest for his beloved. The Rajiz poet said: 'I will reveal to you in what I reveal... I have two needs (Shajnan): A need in Najd? And a need for me in the lands of Sindh.' Another said: 'My companions traveled and did not find my passion (Wajd)... And people have needs (Shujan) and I have a need alone.' Wasab is the pain of love and its sickness, for the origin of Wasab is illness. Kamad is suppressed sadness, and Kamad is the change of color. Arraq (Sleeplessness) and Sahar (Wakefulness) are among the necessities of love. Hanin (Nostalgia) is longing. The root of its matter is covering. Excessive love covers the intellect so the lover does not reason what benefits him nor what harms him. It is a branch of madness, and some love is madness. Wudd (Affection) is pure love, its subtlest and most tender. It is to Love as Ra'fah (Compassion) is to Rahmah (Mercy). Khullah (Friendship/Intimacy) is the unification of love. The Khalil (Intimate Friend) is the one who unifies his love for his beloved. It is a rank that does not accept partnership. For this reason, the two Khalils, Ibrahim and Muhammad, blessings of Allah be upon them both, were distinguished by it in the world, as He said: 'And Allah took Ibrahim as a Khalil.' And it is authentic from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: 'Indeed Allah took me as a Khalil just as He took Ibrahim as a Khalil.' And in the Sahih from him: 'If I were to take a Khalil from the people of earth, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a Khalil.' It was said it was named Khullah because love permeates (takhallal) all parts of the spirit. The poet said:",

    "text": "'You permeated the place of the spirit in me... And for that, the Khalil was named Khalil.' One who has no knowledge claimed that the Habib (Beloved) is better than the Khalil, saying Muhammad is Habibullah and Ibrahim is Khalilullah. This claim is false because Khullah is specific, which is the unification of love as mentioned, and Mahabbah (Love) is general. Allah Almighty said: 'Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.' It is authentic that Allah Almighty took a Prophet as a Khalil, so he obtained the blessings of general love upon the specific and the general: 'You settled in this place, then a place... In this, so both valleys became pleasant.' Gharam (Infatuation/Debt) is necessary love. It is said a man is 'Mughram' with love, meaning love has stuck to him. In 'Al-Sahah', Gharam is fondness, and the Gharim is the one who owes a debt, and it may be the one to whom the debt is owed. Kuthayyir said: 'Every debtor paid off his creditor... And Azza is procrastinating, causing her creditor to suffer.' Walah (Bewilderment) is the loss of mind and confusion from intense passion. It has names other than these which I omitted fearing elongation. Mahabbah (Love) is the mother of all these names. It was said Shawq (Longing) is a genus and Mahabbah is a type of it. Do you not see that every love is longing but not every longing is love? The author of 'Al-Manzum wal-Manthur' disagreed with that. He said: They claimed that Ishq, Wajd, and Hawa are to desire a thing and follow it whether in error or guidance, and Hubb (Love) is a letter that organizes these three. It may be said regarding the 'Ashiq' (Lover), 'Wajid' (Passionate), and the one who desires a matter, that he is a 'Muhibb' (Lover). People have many words regarding the definition of Mahabbah. It was said: It is the permanent inclination of the wandering heart. It was said: It is your standing for your beloved with all that he loves from you. It was said: Mentioning the beloved to the count of breaths, as Al-Mutanabbi said: 'It is desired from the heart to forget you... But natures refuse the transfer.' It was said it is accompanying the beloved constantly, as was said: 'It is a wonder that I yearn for them... And ask about them whoever I meet while they are with me. My eye seeks them while they are in its pupil... And my heart longs for them while they are between my ribs.' It was said it is the presence of the beloved with the lover constantly, as the other said: 'Your phantom is in my eye and your mention is in my mouth... And your abode is in my heart, so where do you disappear?' Regarding its derivation, there are also opinions. It was said it is derived from 'Habbat al-Qalb' (Grain of the Heart), which is its core, and it is said its fruit; so Love was named that for its reaching the grain of the heart. It was said it is derived from necessity and stability; from it 'Ahabba al-Ba'ir' (The camel knelt) if it knelt and did not stand. It was said from 'Hubab al-Ma'' (Bubbles of water) - with Fatha on Ha - which is its main part, or what rises on water during heavy rain. According to this, Love is the boiling of the heart. It was said: From 'Hubb al-Ma'' (Water Jar) in which it is placed, because it holds what water is in it and has no room for other than it if it is filled with it. Likewise, if the heart is filled with Love, there is no room in it for other than the beloved. Mentioning the water jar which Egyptians call 'Al-Zir', how beautiful is the saying of Judge Muhyi al-Din Abd al-Zahir riddling about the Zir jug, containing an objection that mars it and good composition that adorns it: 'Possessor of an ear without hearing... He has a heart without a heart. If he takes over a Hubb (Jar/Love)... Then say what you wish about the Sabb (Pouring/Lover).' Chapter Four: Its Praise and Dispraise. I say: We established this section for the praise of Ishq and its dispraise, its antidote and its poison. How many a wise man praised it and a pseudo-wise dispraised it. Alas, the one who dispraised the Desired One missed out, and from where do sins come to the beautiful face? Among its praiseworthy characteristics and existing virtues is what the scholar Qudamah said: 'Ishq is a virtue that produces cunning, encourages the coward, makes the hand of the miser generous, clears the mind of the stupid, unleashes the tongue of the stutterer with poetry, and incites the determination of the helpless. It is a mighty thing to which the might of kings lowers itself, and the assault of the brave humbles itself. It is the caller to literature, and the first door by which minds and intellects are opened, and by which the intricacies of plots and tricks are extracted. To it ambitions rest, and repulsive morals and characters settle. It entertains its companion and comforts its intimate. It has a joy that roams in souls and a happiness that dwells in hearts.' It was said to a scholar: 'Your son has fallen in love.' He said: 'Praise be to Allah, now his edges will soften, his meanings will become subtle, his gestures will become witty, his movements will become elegant, his expressions will become good, his letters will improve, and his character will become clear. So persevere in the beautiful and avoid the ugly.' It was said to another similarly, and he said: 'No harm, if he loves, he becomes subtle, witty, precise, and tender.' It was said to Buzurjmihr: 'When does a youth become eloquent?' He said: 'If he authors a book or describes a desire or a beloved.' Al-Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf spoke truly when he said: 'People are none but lovers possessing desire... And there is no good in one who does not love and fall in passion.' Another said: 'It would not please me that I am free of desire... Even if I had what is between east and west.' Another said: 'There is no good in the world without ardent love... Nor in a bliss in which there is no beloved.' Another said: 'Dwell with a companion you delight in his love... Time has gone while you are empty and solitary.' Another said:",

    "text": "'If you do not taste in this abode a youthful passion... Then your death in it and life are equal.' Another said: 'There is no good in the world if you do not visit... A beloved, nor does a beloved come to you.' Another said: 'No one tasted the misery of living and its bliss... In the past if he did not fall in love.' Al-Mutanabbi said: 'I blamed the people of love until I tasted it... Then I wondered how one who does not love dies.' I said, including Al-Mutanabbi's saying with an addition of double entendre (Tawriya): 'If you ask about what I encountered of desire... Then I am the one who practiced it and knew it. You disagreed regarding the sipping of saliva and its taste... And I blamed the people of love until I tasted it.' It is told that King Bahram Gur had one son, and he wanted to nominate him for kingship after him, but found him of low ambition and base soul. So he set slave girls and singers upon him, and he fell in love with one of them. King Bahram was informed of this and rejoiced. He sent to the one it was said he loved: 'Transgress against him and say: I am only fit for one of noble soul and high ambition, a king or a scholar.' When she said that, he reviewed knowledge and the high ambition kings are upon until he excelled in that and took over the kingdom, becoming one of their best. He recorded that in wisdom to Kisra: 'A king does not become complete except after his love, and likewise the scholar.' They said: Permissible love is something the lover is rewarded for, as Sharik said when asked about lovers: 'The most intense of them in love has the greatest reward.' They said: The souls of lovers are fragrant and subtle, their bodies are weak, and their souls are slow to submit to anyone who leads them except their dwelling (beloved) to whom they dwelt and upon whom they tied their love. The speech of lovers and their companionship increase intellects, stir souls, delight spirits, bring joys, and create longing for the endeavors of their news among kings and those below them. It suffices the poor lover who was not mentioned with kings and brave heroes that he loves and becomes famous for love, so he is mentioned in the gatherings of kings and caliphs and those below them; his news circulate and his poems are narrated, and love remains for him an eternal mention. Were it not for love, no name would be mentioned for him, no trace would occur for him, no head would be raised for him, nor would he be mentioned among people. Al-Marzubani said: Abu Nawfal was asked: 'Has anyone escaped love?' He said: 'Yes, the rude churl who has no virtue nor understanding. As for one who has the slightest wit in his nature or has the gentleness of the people of Hijaz and the wit of the people of Iraq, he does not escape it.' Some said: No one is free of youthful passion unless he is coarse in creation, deficient, of diminished structure, or contrary to the composition of moderation: 'Oh wonder at time, not a soul is free... Of love, until even water is loved by wine.' It suffices the lover that he is eager for kindness and aiding the distressed, as was said: 'He is eager for kindness in seeking heights... That his character may be praised one day before Laila.' Abu al-Najab said: I saw in the Tawaf (circumambulation of Kaaba) a youth thin of body showing weakness, seeking refuge and praying, saying: 'I wished that love were gathered entirely... And thrown into my heart and the chest splits. What is in my heart of desire does not end... Nor my joy in love, or life ends.' I said: 'O young man, does this Structure (Kaaba) not have a sanctity that prevents you from this speech?' He said: 'Yes, by Allah, but love filled my heart so I wished for death. By Allah, what is in my heart of it does not please me (to exchange) for what the Commander of the Faithful has of kingship. I pray that Allah establishes it in my heart for my life and makes it my bedfellow in my grave, whether I know of it or not. This is my prayer, and for it I aimed, and in it I desired from what Allah gives the rest of His creation.' Then he passed on. I say: I mentioned here what Al-Akhtal said when Abd al-Malik blamed him for wine. He said: 'I wonder what pleases you in it... Its beginning is bitterness and its end is a headache.' He said: 'But between them, by Allah, is a euphoria I would not sell for your Caliphate, O Commander of the Faithful.' The poet took it and said: 'If the beginning of wine is hateful... Or the end of wine is a headache. Then it has between this and that trifles... Describing them with joy will not be possible.' As for what came in its dispraise and the spreading of its poison, it is more than can be counted. How many a rich man it left a pauper, and an owner a slave, as was said: 'He remained from the excess of his love a slave (Mamluk)... While he was before that a king (Malik). The fawns of the palace left him a youth... Wandering on the ground, left alone.' These verses are by one of the kings of Andalusia, and their mention will come in the second chapter of this book, God willing. How many a lover wasted on his beloved his wealth, honor, and soul, and lost his family and the interests of his religion and world, and fell into what he refuses. Yes, by Allah. 'And love drags souls to destruction... By nature, and oh my envy for the one who did not love.'",

    "text": "They said: How many a lover fled from love to positions of destruction to escape destruction by destruction. Regarding this is the story of Di'bil the poet. He said: I was at the frontier when the call to arms was sounded. I went out with the people, and there was a youth dragging his spear before me. He turned and looked at me and said: 'Are you Di'bil?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Listen to me,' then recited: 'I am in my matter rightly guided... Between love and jihad. My body raids an enemy... And desire raids my heart.' Then he said: 'What do you think?' I said: 'Good, by Allah.' He said: 'By Allah, I did not go out except fleeing from love.' Then he fought until he was killed. Al-Wawa al-Dimashqi said: 'The path of desire is rugged and the sweet of desire is bitter... And the cold of desire is heat and the day of desire is an age.' Another said: 'Love is a distraction from every righteous deed... And a drunkenness of love negates the drunkenness of slumber.' Abd al-Muhsin al-Suri said: 'What is with me started as jest... But when it took hold, it became madness. I used to think desire was easy... Then I encountered from it a humiliating punishment.' Muhammad al-Yazidi said: 'How can people bear describing desire... While it is majestic and has no measure? Rather, how can love be pure for the ally of desire... When in it are separation and abandonment?' How excellent is the saying of Abdullah bin Isbat al-Qayrawani: 'The empty one said desire is impossible... So I said: If you tasted it, you would know it. He said: Is it other than occupying a heart... If you do not please it, you dismiss it? And is it other than a sigh and a tear... If you do not want its flow, you stop it? I said: After every description... You did not know love when you described it.' Note: 'Hawa' (Desire) is mostly used for blameworthy love. Allah Almighty said: \"But as for he who feared the position of his Lord and prevented the soul from [unlawful] inclination (Hawa), then indeed, Paradise will be [his] refuge.\" It may be used for praiseworthy love in a restricted usage, and from it is the Hadith: \"None of you believes until his desire (hawah) is in accordance with what I have brought.\" Ibn Abbas said: Hawa is a worshipped god, and he recited: 'Have you seen he who has taken as his god his desire (hawah)?' So it is summarized from the Noble Verse and the Noble Hadith that Hawa is divided into two types: Praiseworthy Hawa, which is in goodness and righteousness, and Blameworthy Hawa, which is in evil and corruption. In the book 'Al-Sahl al-Muati fi Fada'il Ibn Mamati': Some Sufis said: It was named Hawa (Desire/Falling) because it makes its owner fall (yahwi) into the Fire. I said: If he had said it makes its owner fall into the Abyss (Hawiyah), it would have been more appropriate. Some said Hawa is Hwan (Humiliation) with the Nun added, as was said: 'So I asked her with a signal about her state... And against me regarding her the slanderers have eyes. She sighed deeply and said: What is Hawa... Except Hwan (Humiliation) with the Nun removed from it.' And His Almighty saying: \"He adhered to the earth and followed his desire (hawah).\" It was said adhered to the earth means he settled to it and descended by his nature upon it, so his soul was earthly and lower, not heavenly and upper. According to how much the servant adheres to the earth, he descends from the sky. Sahl said: Allah apportioned for the limbs from desire a share for each limb. If a limb among them inclines to desire, its harm returns to the heart. The soul has seven heavenly veils and seven earthly veils. Whenever the servant buries his soul earth by earth, his heart ascends sky by sky. If he buries the soul under the soil, his heart reaches the Throne. The result of the issue is that Love and Desire are the root of every calamity, and in it is the humiliation of every proud soul. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"It is not fitting for a man to humiliate himself.\" Imam Ahmad said its interpretation is to expose himself to affliction he cannot bear. This corresponds to the state of the lover, for he humiliated himself for his beloved, as was said: 'Submit and lower yourself to whom you love, for there is not in... The law of desire a nose that is raised and knotted.' Another said: 'Poor represent the people of love, even their graves... Upon them is the dust of humiliation among the graves.' Sheikh Sharaf al-Din bin al-Farid said: 'It is Love, so submit your heart; desire is not easy... So no one exhausted by it chose it while he has a mind. And live empty, for love's comfort is fatigue... Its beginning is sickness and its end is killing.' Its beginning is sickness and its end is killing. Chapter Five: People's disagreement on whether it is involuntary or voluntary. I say: This is a section we established for what was previously mentioned, and its dawn shone like the morning. For people have speech regarding it from both sides and swagger between the two ranks. One saying it is involuntary and one saying it is voluntary. Each of the laws has a pleasant face...",

    "text": "...and a preponderant amount. We mention of that what benefit is general, and speak of its length and width by the fathom and cubit. Of that is what Judge Abu Amr Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Nawfani said in his book 'Tuhfat al-Zurraf': Lovers are excused in every case, forgiven for all words and deeds, for Love only struck them without choice, rather it afflicted them by compulsion and force. A person is only blamed for matters he is capable of, not in what is decreed. Upon him be blessings and peace: 'She lays down her burden.' How do you see this one, did she lay it down by choice from her was that, or by compulsion? No, indeed by compulsion and loss of ability. This is something in which there is no doubt nor confusion, nor does its opposite flutter in a heart. I said: It came in the interpretation of His saying Almighty: \"And when they saw him, they greatly admired him (akbarnahu),\" meaning they saw him as great in their eyes. It was said they menstruated out of astonishment. Ibn Abbas said they emitted semen and sperm out of astonishment, and cut their hands thinking they were cutting the citrons, and did not feel pain from cutting their hands due to the ignition of their hearts with his beauty. Wahb said: They were forty women, and nine of them died out of passion for Joseph and grief over him. How excellent is the saying of one of the Banu Udhra, when an Arab said to him: 'What is with one of you dying of love in desire for a woman he is familiar with? This is but weakness of soul, softness, and frailty found in you, O Banu Udhra.' He said: 'By Allah, if you saw the arched eyebrows above the large black eyes, beneath which are the spaced teeth, you would have taken them as Al-Lat and Al-Uzza.' Al-Fudayl bin Iyad said: 'If Allah granted me an answered prayer, I would pray to Allah with it to forgive the lovers, because their movements are involuntary, not voluntary.' Abu al-Sa'ib al-Makhzumi, who was a man of knowledge and religion, was seen clinging to the curtains of the Kaaba saying: 'O Allah, have mercy on lovers and strengthen their hearts, and incline the hearts of the beloveds towards them.' He was asked about that. He said: 'By Allah, praying for them is better than an Umrah from Al-Ji'ranah.' Then he recited: 'O Abandonment, desist from desire and leave desire... For lovers to be pleasant, O Abandonment. What do you want from those whose eyelids... Are ulcerated and the stuffing of their hearts is ember? Withered from desire, their colors... From what their hearts hide are yellow. And the flowing tears upon their cheeks... Are pearls overflowing as if they are rain.' It appears that his saying 'better than an Umrah from Al-Ji'ranah' is what emboldened Al-Fath bin Khaqan to say in verses: 'O lover, tormented, have patience... For the sins of the people of desire are forgiven. A sigh in desire puts down more sin... Than a ghazwa (raid) and an accepted Hajj.' I said: He exaggerated in this speech until he deserved blame. Would that he sufficed with what was said in representation: 'Although I am content to bear desire... And be free of it, neither against me nor for me.' It appears that what drove him to this is what Al-Shafi'i held, that the one who dies of love is among the martyrs, due to the Hadith reported regarding that, and its mention will come in the Chapter of Chastity, God willing. Al-Tamimi said in his book 'Imtizaj al-Arwah' (Mixing of Spirits): Some doctors were asked about Love. They said that its occurrence to its people is not by their choice nor by their greed for it, nor is there pleasure for most of them in it, but its occurrence to them is like the occurrence of debilitating ailments and destructive diseases. He said: There is no difference between it and that. Al-Mada'ini said: A man blamed a man from the people of desire. He said: 'If the one who desired had a choice, he would not desire, but the one who desired has no choice.' They said: Love is a type of torment, and a rational person does not choose torment for himself. Regarding this, Al-Mu'ammil said: 'Looking on the day of Al-Hirah cured Al-Mu'ammil... Would that Al-Mu'ammil had not been created with sight. Suffice the lovers in the world their torment... By Allah, Hellfire will not torment them afterwards.' It is told that he attained what he wished, for he went blind after his saying. Abu Muhammad bin Hazm said: A man said to Umar bin Al-Khattab: 'O Commander of the Faithful, I saw a woman and fell in love with her.' Umar said: 'That is of what cannot be controlled.' Kamil said regarding Salma: 'They blame me for the love of Salma as if... They see desire as something I wished for intentionally. Lo, indeed the Love that cracked the vitals... Is a decree from the Merciful testing the servant.' Sheikh Shams al-Din Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya said: Many of the predecessors interpreted His saying Almighty: \"Our Lord, and do not burden us with that which we have no ability to bear\" as Love (Ishq). They did not intend restriction by this, but representation, and that Love is among the burdens that cannot be borne. The burdening meant here is the Predestined Burdening, not the Legislative Command Burdening. End of his words.",

    "text": "Ubayd Allah bin Tawus said regarding His saying Almighty: \"And mankind was created weak.\" He said: If he looks at women, he does not have patience. Sufyan bin Sa'id reported it from him in his Tafsir. They said: We have seen groups of lovers circulating around those who pray for them that Allah heals them from Love. Had it been voluntary, they would have removed it from their souls. From this, the error of many blamers becomes clear, and it appears that their blaming of this state is like blaming a sick person for his sickness. How excellent is the saying of some: 'O my blamer, while the matter is in His hand... Why did you not blame while the matter was in my hand?' Indeed, blame should be before this disease attaches to the heart and the tears of the pouring lover pour forth. A group of doctors and others held that it is voluntary, not involuntary. It was previously mentioned in the definition of Love mentioned by Ibn Sina and others that it is an obsessive disease a person brings upon himself by focusing his thought on the approval of certain forms and characteristics. This is a declaration from them that the human is the chooser in Love by focusing his thought which falls into the seas of his drunkenness. They said: Because Love (Mahabbah) is a strong will, and a servant is praised and blamed for his will; for this reason, the one desiring good is praised even if he does not do it. Allah Almighty dispraised those who love that immorality should spread among those who believe, and informed that their punishment is painful. Had Love not been owned, He would not have threatened them with punishment for what does not enter under their ability. From it is His saying Almighty: \"And forbade the soul from desire (Hawa).\" It is impossible that a human forbids himself from what does not enter under his ability. They said: Rational people entirely agree on blaming the one who loves what harms him by his love. This is a nature Allah created creation upon. If he excused himself saying 'I do not own my heart', they would not accept an excuse from him. I said: The correct saying in which there is no rejection nor turning away from a beloved is the detailed explanation. It is that Love varies according to the variation of humans and what they are created upon of subtlety, thinness of sides, thickness of liver, hardness of heart, aversion of natures, and other things. Among them are those who, if they see a beautiful image, die from the intensity of what arrives upon their heart of astonishment, as preceded regarding the women who died when they saw Joseph, peace be upon him. Mus'ab bin al-Zubayr used to be such that if a woman saw him, she would be overwhelmed by his beauty. The poet says of him: 'Mus'ab is but a meteor from Allah... By whose light the darkness is revealed.' Among them are those who, if they see a beautiful person, fall from their stature and do not know their sandal from their turban. The poet said: 'It is only that he sees her suddenly... So his legs knock together and he falls to the side.' This one and his likes, his love is involuntary, and disputing it is stubbornness against the tangible. Among them are those whose beginning of love is approval of the person, then a will to be close to him occurs to him, then affection (Mawaddah) which is that he wishes he possessed him, then affection strengthens and becomes love (Mahabbah), then becomes intimacy (Khullah), then becomes desire (Hawa), then becomes passionate love (Ishq), then becomes enslavement (Tatayyum). Tatayyum is a state where the beloved becomes the owner of the lover. Then enslavement increases and becomes bewilderment (Walah). Walah is exiting the limit of arrangement and the suspension of discrimination. This one and his likes, the beginning of his love is voluntary because it was possible for him to repel that and cut off its material. However, this type also, if it ends with its owner where we mentioned, becomes involuntary, as the poet said: 'Love is first jest... Then when it becomes established, it becomes a busy occupation.' For this reason, some philosophers said: I have not seen a truth more resembling falsehood nor a falsehood more resembling truth than Love. Its jest is serious and its seriousness is jest. Its beginning is play and its end is destruction. The poet said: 'He became fond of love until he loved... When he became independent with it, he could not bear it. He saw a depth he thought was a wave... When he became established in it, he drowned.' The author of 'Rawdat al-Muhibbin' said: This is like drunkenness with drinking wine. For taking the intoxicant is voluntary, and what is generated from it of drunkenness is involuntary. So whenever the cause occurs by his choice, he is not excused in what is generated from it without his choice. There is no doubt that continuing the look and sustaining the thought is like drinking the intoxicant, so he is blamed for the cause. For this reason, if love occurs for a non-prohibited reason, its owner is not blamed for it, like one who loved his wife or slave girl then separated from her, and her love remained inseparable from him. This one is not blamed for that, as in the famous story of Mughith and Barira. It has appeared by this that Love is sometimes involuntary and sometimes voluntary, and that is according to the perfection of the lover as preceded. Thus, the claim of the one who said it is absolutely involuntary or absolutely voluntary is not accepted by those of intellect. And Allah Almighty knows best. I say: And here ends the speech on these chapters whose time was pleasant and moderate, and by which the red of shame appeared in the cheek of the rose. Nothing remains but to enter the Chapters in the suggested manner and bring what Allah Almighty opens, and whoever knocks on the door of a Generous One, it opens. Chapter One: Mention of Beauty and Comeliness.",

    "text": "And what has been said about them in detail and summary. I say: We established this chapter to speak on Beauty and its divisions, and the beloved and his speech. Especially if he smiles revealing bubbles (of teeth/saliva), and the cold (freshness) ripples in his mouth. So his kissed place becomes sweet, and his beauty is equal in the present, his past, and his future. There, he encompasses of Beauty the two divisions which are the Apparent and the Hidden, the Departing and the Resident. The Hidden Beauty is praiseworthy for itself, like knowledge, skill, generosity, and courage. The Apparent Beauty is what appears of the branch of his moist stature, and his face which surpassed the full moon without the absence of the sun at sunset. At that point, he gloats over the full moon with his beauty marks (shamat), and says to his cheek which increased in beauty by them: Whoever increases, Allah increases his good deeds (hasanat). Therefore, it was said: Pure Beauty is what makes mouths speak with glorification (Tasbih). It was said rather it is as was said: 'Something by which mankind is tempted other than what is claimed as beauty, and I do not know what it is.' I say: And this is the correct view because its essence is not known nor its semblance recognized. So it is as if it is an idea that cannot be defined, and an unknown that is not known. Therefore, some said: Beauty has a meaning that expression cannot reach nor description encompass. It was said Beauty (Husn) is derived from Hasana (Good deed). I say: It appears that for this meaning beauty marks (Shamat) were called Hasanat (Good deeds/marks). Some said regarding a beautiful black woman: 'O Lord, a black woman reveals... By her beauty, the darknesses. What do they fault in seeing her... When all of her is Hasanat (Good deeds/marks)?' I said: 'And a face whose luster vanished so... Its beauties became defects with his beard. Unlucky with beauty marks, he became... So his Hasanat are nothing but sins (Dhunub/Tails).' It was said Beauty is a matter composed of things: brightness, morning-like fairness, good formation, planning, and blood-color in the skin. It was said Beauty is the proportion of creation, its moderation, and its straightness. Many a form is proportionate in creation but not much in beauty. Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'If the whiteness of a woman is complete with the goodness of her hair, then her beauty is complete.' Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said: 'Whiteness is half of beauty.' They said regarding a slave girl: 'Jamila' (Beautiful) from afar, 'Maliha' (Pretty/Salty) from near. The Jamila is the one who takes the whole of your sight, but if she nears you she is not so. The Maliha is the one who, whenever you repeat your sight on her, increases you in appreciation of beauty. It was said Jamila implies fatness, from Jamal (Camel) which is fat. Maliha is also from Mulha which is whiteness. And Sabihah (Morning-like) likewise from Subh (Morning) due to its whiteness. Some said: Wit is in the stature, skill in the neck, thinness in the extremities and waist, and the whole matter is in speech. The best beauty is what is not brought by adornment. Imru' al-Qais said: 'I found goodness in her even if she did not wear perfume.' Another said: 'The Maliha is she whom her jewelry adorns... Not she who became adorned by her jewelry.' Some philologists said: Arabs say sweetness is in the eyes, prettiness (Malaha) in the mouth, beauty (Jamal) in the nose, and wit (Zarf) in the tongue. From it is the saying of Al-Hasan, may Allah be pleased with him: 'If the thief is witty, his hand is not cut,' meaning if he falls, he defends himself with the fluency of his tongue and logic. How excellent is the saying of some: The body contains the face and the extremities. In the face are the beauties, and towards them is the aspiration. In the beauties are the points (Nuqat) which are the utmost in approval and wit. Like Malaha in the eye, and the point of Malaha is Da'aj (Intense blackness with whiteness). And like Hasan in the mouth, and the point of Hasan is Falaj (Gap between teeth). And like Talawa (Grace) in the forehead, and the point of Talawa is Balaj (Separation of eyebrows/brightness). And like Rawnaq (Luster) in the cheek, and the point of the cheek is Darih (Smoothness/Transparency). What is considered beautiful in a woman are four long things: her extremities, her stature, her hair, and her neck. And four short things: her hands, her feet, her tongue, and her eyes. The meaning of this moral shortness is that she does not squander what is in her husband's house, does not leave her house, does not chatter with her tongue, and does not covet with her eye. And four white things: her color, her parting (of hair), her teeth (Thaghr), and the white of her eye. And four black things: her eyelashes, her eyebrows, her eyes, and her hair. And four red things: her tongue, her cheek, and her lips with dark red hue (La's) and mingling of her whiteness with redness. And four thick things: her leg, her wrist, her buttocks, and what is there. And four wide things: her forehead, her brow, her eye, and her chest. And four tight things: her mouth, her nostril, her ear canal, and what is there, which is the greatest intent from a woman. It was said a slave girl was found in the time of the Sassanids with all these mentioned attributes. How worthy she was that it be said in her right: 'If Azza judged the sun of the forenoon... In beauty before a successful judge, he would judge for her.' It is told that Ya'sur, one of the kings of China, gifted to Kisra Anushirwan, the King of Persia, a gift including a slave girl who disappears in her hair and glitters with beauty. So Kisra sent him a gift including a slave girl seven cubits tall, her eyelashes striking her cheeks, as if between her eyelids was the flash of lightning, with joined eyebrows, having braids she drags when she walks.",

    "text": "Section: The author of 'Rawdat al-Muhibbin' said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, used to call people to inner beauty through outer beauty, as Jarir bin Abdullah said. Umar bin Al-Khattab used to call him the Joseph of this Ummah. He said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to me: \"You are a man whose creation Allah has made beautiful.\" Some wise men said: A servant should look every day in the mirror; if he sees his image is beautiful, he should not mar it with his ugly deed. And if he sees it ugly, he should not combine ugliness of form and deed. Some have put this into verse saying: 'O beautiful of face, beware of ugly deeds... Do not spoil the adornment with disgrace. And O ugly of face, be a doer of good... Do not combine two uglinesses.' Since beauty is, by its nature, beloved to souls and magnified in hearts, Allah did not send a Prophet except beautiful of face, noble of lineage, and good of voice, as Ali bin Abi Talib said when asked: 'Was the face of the Messenger, peace be upon him, like a sword?' He said: 'No, but like the moon.' In his description, peace be upon him: 'As if the sun runs in his face.' He was as his poet Hassan bin Thabit said: 'Whenever his forehead appears in the pitch-black darkness... It shines like the lamp of the blazing darkness. So who was or who might be like Ahmad... An order for truth or a punishment for an aggressor.' He also said: 'More beautiful than you my eye has never seen... And more perfect than you women have not given birth to. You were created free from every defect... As if you were created as you wished.' Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, used to say when he saw him: 'Trustworthy, chosen, calling to good... Like the light of the full moon when darkness leaves it.' Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, used to recite Zuhair's verse when he saw him: 'If you were anything other than a human... You would be the illuminator of the night of the full moon.' Aisha looked at him one day then smiled. He asked her about that. She said: 'It is as if Abu Kabir al-Hudhali meant you by his saying: And if you looked at the lines of his face... They flashed like the lightning of the pouring cloud.' In summary, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was at the highest peak of beauty. It was narrated that some Companions met a monk who said: 'Describe Muhammad to me as if I am looking at him, for I saw his description in the Torah and the Gospel.' He said: 'He was not excessively tall nor short above medium height, white in color imbued with redness, curly haired not frizzy, his hair reaching the lobe of his ear, solid forehead, distinct eyebrows, black-eyed, aquiline nosed, with spaced front teeth, as if his neck were a silver pitcher, his face like the circle of the moon.' So the monk embraced Islam. He, peace be upon him, with this beauty, had love and awe cast upon him; whoever's eyes fell upon him loved him and held him in awe. Allah Almighty completed for him the ranks of perfection outwardly and inwardly, so he was the best of Allah's creation in form and character, image and meaning. Likewise was Joseph, peace be upon him. Rabi'a said: 'Beauty was divided into two halves; between Sarah and Joseph was half of beauty, and half of beauty was between the rest of people.' In the Sahih from him, peace be upon him, that he saw Joseph on the Night of Isra and he had been given half of beauty. The Prophet, peace be upon him, appreciated that a messenger be handsome of face and good of name. He used to say: 'If you send a messenger, let him be handsome of face, good of name.' Al-Khara'iti narrated from the Hadith of Ibn Jurayj from Abu Mulayka raising it: 'Whoever Allah gives a handsome face and a good name and places him in a position not disgraceful to him, he is among Allah's chosen of His creation.' Wahb said: David said: 'O Lord, which of your servants is most beloved to You?' He said: 'A believer of handsome form.' He said: 'Which of your servants is most hateful to You?' He said: 'A disbeliever of ugly form.' It is mentioned from Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, had a group of his companions waiting for him at the door, so he began looking in the mirror (or water vessel) and smoothing his hair and beard, then went out to them. She said: 'O Messenger of Allah, even you do this?' He said: 'Yes. If a man goes out to his brothers, let him beautify himself, for Allah is Beautiful and loves Beauty.' Mu'awiyah said to a man who entered upon him, seeing in his face something he disliked which could be removed: 'What prevents one of you, when he leaves his house, from attending to the skin of his face?'",

    "text": "Section: His Almighty saying: \"We have certainly created man in the best of stature (Taqwim).\" Meaning in the best adjustment of his stature and image, and goodness of his appearance, upright, eating his food with his hand, adorned with intellect, not like animals. Regarding this is the story of Al-Rashid when he was alone with his wife on a moonlit night. He said to her: 'If you are not more beautiful than this moon, then you are divorced.' The scholars of his time issued a fatwa that the oath was broken (divorce occurred), except Yahya bin Aktham, for he said: 'Divorce does not fall upon him.' It was said to him: 'You contradicted your sheikhs.' He said: 'The fatwa is by knowledge, and One who is more knowledgeable than us has given a fatwa on it, and He is Allah Almighty where He said: \"We have certainly created man in the best of stature.\"' The interpretation of His saying Almighty \"He increases in creation what He wills\" came as the beautiful voice and the beautiful face. For this reason, Abu Firas said: 'He surpassed the moon of the sky in beauty... While people in his love are equal. So his Lord increased him with cheek-hair (Idhar)... By which beauty and splendor were completed. Do not wonder, our Lord is Capable... He increases in creation what He wills.' It was told about a woman who used to pray much at night. She was asked about that. She said: 'It beautifies the face, and I love that my face be beautified.' It is told that Al-Ma'mun reviewed an army. A hideous man passed by, so he asked him to speak and found him stuttering. He ordered him dropped. He said: 'If the soul's effect falls on the exterior, it is fairness (Sabaha), and if its effect falls on the interior, it is eloquence (Fasaha). This man has neither exterior nor interior.' But a person has two judgments: One from the side of his body, which is his appearance, and the other from the side of his soul, which is his substance. They often accompany each other. Therefore, physiognomists finished knowing the states of the soul from the bodily form, to the point that some wise men said: 'Rarely is a beautiful form found governed by a bad soul.' He, peace be upon him, said: 'Seek needs from those with beautiful faces.' All this indicates that beauty and physical perfection are virtues. Indicates it His saying Almighty: \"And He increased him extensively in knowledge and body.\" Beauty is the first happiness of man because Allah Almighty, by the subtlety of His wisdom, did not create a form with chosen attributes, safe from defects, except that He added to it what suits it of intellect and attributes. Rarely do you find character except following creation (physical form), a consistent proportion, a principle that does not reverse, and a consensus that does not isolate. Allah never created a Prophet except that he dazzled the people of his time with his beauty and benevolence. If you look at him the first time, you see him the best of them in form and the most perfect in structure. He is the worthiest of rank and the highest in merit. He, peace be upon him, said: 'Allah does not punish the beautiful of faces, the black of eyes.' Imam Fakhr al-Din al-Razi said in 'Asrar al-Tanzil' summarized: Beauty of form, although it is a desired matter, beauty of conduct (Sirah) is among the demands of wisdom. There is no doubt that wisdom is better than desire, so beauty of conduct is better than beauty of form inevitably. Among that is that Joseph, peace be upon him, combined beauty of form and beauty of conduct. Then, because of beauty of form, he fell into types of calamities. Among them is that his father loved him more than his brothers, evidenced by His saying: \"When they said, 'Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we.'\" So they intended to kill him, evidenced by His recounting of them: \"Kill Joseph or cast him out to some [other] land; the face of your father will be yours alone.\" Among them is that he fell due to beauty into the captivity of slavery, the seduction of the Aziz's wife, and his entering prison because of that. But when the King knew after that his beauty of conduct, he chose him for himself and said to him: \"Indeed, you are today established, trusted,\" and did not say \"fair, pretty.\" This indicates that beauty of conduct is better than beauty of form. It is known that beauty of form only remains for a few days, whereas beauty of conduct, its effect does not vanish nor its result become void. I say: Among those who were harmed because of their beautiful form was Nasr bin Hajjaj. That is because Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, passed by at night and heard a woman saying: 'Is there a way to wine so I may drink it... Or is there a way to Nasr bin Hajjaj?' So he called for Nasr bin Hajjaj, who was from Banu Sulaym, and saw him as the most beautiful of people in face and having beautiful hair. So he shaved his hair, but he was more beautiful without hair. He said: 'Do not live with me in a city.' Nasr pleaded with him not to expel him from Medina, but Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, did not accept. When Nasr bid him farewell, he said to him: 'O Commander of the Faithful, you have sentenced me to kill myself.' Umar said: 'How is that?' He said: 'Allah Almighty said: \"And if We had decreed upon them, 'Kill yourselves' or 'Leave your homes'.\" So He coupled this with this.' Umar said: 'You are not far off, but I say what Shu'ayb, peace be upon him, said: \"I only intend reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through Allah.\" I have doubled your stipend for you so that may be a compensation for you.' I say: I remembered by his shaving of his hair 'but he was more beautiful without hair' the saying of some in that: 'They shaved his head to increase him in ugliness... Out of jealousy from them over him and stinginess.",

    "text": "'It was a morning over which was a pitch-black night... So they erased his night and left him as morning.' How excellent is the saying of Al-Siraj Al-Warraq regarding a handsome Qalandari: 'I loved from his saliva a wine... While he had at that time no mustache. O Qalandar, they shaved an eyebrow... Of his like the Nun of calligraphy from a scribe. A Sultan of beauty increased in his justice... So he chose to remain without a doorman (Hajib/Eyebrow).' Ibn Sana' al-Mulk said: 'I imitated my body towards you... So did you fall in love with your beauty? Your eyelid was exhausting... So you became entirely your eyelid. And the illness increased you in beauty... By Allah, indeed you are you.' Section: It has been mentioned what is admired in a woman. Let us mention here what poets said in comparing body parts to letters, for they did much of that. They compared the eyebrow to the Nun, the eye and temple curl to the Waw, the mouth to the Mim and Sad, the teeth to the Sin, and the braided forelock to the Shin. Among the best said in that is the saying of Mahasin al-Shawwa: 'He let down a lock (Far') and twisted, deserting me, a temple curl (Sudgh)... So he exhausted a describer with both. So I thought that one, due to his creation, a snake... Striving, and this a scorpion stopping. Possessor of an Alif not for union, and possessor of a Waw... But not the Conjunction (Atifah).' And the saying of another: 'Ya-Sin is her forelock and Sad is her eyes... I seek refuge for her with Surah Ta-Ha.' And the saying of Ibn Matruh: 'The Alif of the cheek-hair on his cheek told us... In the Mim of his mouth is the cure for the thirsty.' And the saying of Ibn Naqada: 'He gathered beauty, so a Sad from her eye... And the Nun is her eyebrow dotted with a mole. And the Mim is her mouth, so the letters combined... Written, and patience regarding them is scraped off.' And the saying of another: 'Do not say No to me, for it is written on... Your face radiating with light: Yes (Na'am - Nun, Ain, Mim). With letters formed by decree... Upon which a pen never ran. Its Nun is the eyebrow, and the Ain (Eye) is... Your enchanting glance, and the Mim is the mouth.' Shihab al-Din Ahmad bin al-Khaymi said: 'Indeed the temple curl of the beloved and the mouth and the cheek... From him are Waw, Sad, and Lam (W-S-L = Wasl/Union). It is a union between beauties when... It completed beauty, and with the cheek-hair is the completion (Tamam). Except that I see it as a union of farewell... Leading to our separation and peace (Salam).' I said: 'A beloved who came high when I described him... And the spear of his stature said: What stands? And the line of my cheek-hair dotted the Lam of the mole... And I did not know that the Lam in script is dotted.' I also said: 'He gazes at me with an eye whose eyebrow is a Nun... Like the bow piercing the targets while it twangs.' I also said, in the reverse of this meaning—which is comparing letters to body parts—in evaluating a poem with which I praised our Master the Sultan Al-Malik Al-Nasir Hasan: 'How many an Alif in it became... A slender stature, fresh? And how many a Shin in the margin of the... Book you imagine as a forelock? And an Ain became in the eye... Like the gold and the silver.' I also said: In evaluating a letter that arrived from some loved ones from a missive he opened with a poem, of which is: 'I rejected sleep after you, O Ali... So do not wonder at my tears that they followed in succession. And a letter came to me from you, high... Its Alifs resembled the long brown spears. How much handwriting I have seen, but... Your example, I have not seen an example like it. Softness by which the Alifs became willow branches... So how many a union in it guaranteed Union (Wisal)? And how many an Alif in it appeared for union... Like the Ban tree branch in softness and moderation. Its Lam embraces it sometimes right... And at times embraces it left. I thought the Lam in it was the cheek-hair of a cheek... And I imagined the dots above the cheek were moles. And the rising of the Ta's in it became... Teaching its softness the branch of perfection.' Judge Al-Fadil said in a letter he wrote to Muwaffaq al-Din Khalid al-Qayrawani, having seen a letter of his written in gold, part of it: 'From Alifs whose branches the Hamzas habitually frequent like doves. And from Lams after which the lover envies them for embracing their soft statures. And from Sads that quenched the thirst of thirsty hearts and hovering eyes. And from Waws that reminded of what is in the surface of temple curls of bends. And from Mims to whose mouth mouths drew near to obtain the harvest of sips. And from Sins like the teeth in those mouths. And from Dals indicating obedience to their writer by the bending of backs. And from Jims like beaks hunting hearts that flutter for the frights of approval like birds. In it is what souls desire and eyes delight in. And Khalid is therein eternal (Khalid), and his greeting therein is praiseworthy (Mahamid), and his hand strikes in melting gold while people strike in cold iron.'",

    "text": "Chapter Two: Mention of Lovers and Wits among Kings and Caliphs. I say: We established this chapter to mention the best of kings in nature, the longest of them in reach, the most pleasant of them in living, the most frivolous of them, the softest of them in poetry, the most precise of them in thought, the nearest of them in return, and the most fond of the beloved among them. For they are, in reality, the most worthy of people for that, and the most deserving of sleeping on those couches. That is according to what their souls seduced them with and their sitting companion adorned for them, as was said: 'Do not ask about the man, but ask about his companion... For every companion imitates the one he accompanies. If you are among people, accompany the best of them... And do not accompany the worst, lest you perish with the destroyed.' Among them are those who were content regarding their beloved with looking... Until he died of grief and joined the likes of Nur al-Din the Martyr among the martyrs. His story will come in the Chapter of Chastity, God willing. Among them are those who became less than him in chastity, and set up the saliva of his beloved in the place of wine. Among them are those who cast off restraint and argued with the saying of the poet regarding liquor: 'Leave off blaming me, for blame is incitement... And treat me with that which was the disease.' So he combined the possessor of necklaces (woman) and the daughter of the bunch (wine), but with maintenance (of dignity) and return to religion. He, even if the session was long for him, shortened it, and if he committed a crime in it against his beloved, he apologized, as was said: 'If I committed a sin while drunk... Then pardon me, O rest of souls. What mind remains there for one like me... Between the drunkenness of passion and the drunkenness of wine?' Among them are those who attained with wine the forbidden pleasure, and brought out by it the cheek of the beloved from an image to an image. So he raced the drinking companion in the crimson wine, and ascended to the beloved like the ascent of bubbles of water, state upon state. This led him to his destruction and the corruption of his kingdom, as happened to Al-Amin son of Al-Rashid and others. Al-Rabi' said: Al-Amin sat one day for the people wearing a blue shawl with a white felt under it. He signed eight hundred petitions. By Allah, he hit the mark and did not err, and was fast and did not slow down. Then he said: 'O Rabi', do you see me not good at management and politics? But I found smelling myrtle, drinking the cup, and lying down without slumber more desirable to me than meeting people.' Likewise, Al-Walid bin Yazid cast off restraint before him, and Al-Mutawakkil after him, and others among the Caliphs and Princes who preferred the comfort of the soul over the fatigue of politics. What I see is releasing what they went to explicitly, and separating from all on a beautiful face, as was said: 'If my blamer saw the face of a beloved... We would have separated on a beautiful face.' How excellent is the saying of Abu al-Fath al-Busti: 'If a king becomes occupied with amusement... Then judge upon his kingdom with woe and war. Do you not see the sun descending in Libra... When it became the sign of amusement and music (Tarab)?' From here we begin mentioning those who humbled themselves to their beloved among kings, so he became, despite being his owner, like the owned. They are in that, despite their severity, contrary to what people are upon. This and that is because Love and its people are ranks. Among them are those for whom Love is not pleasant except with humiliation, and this is dominant over lovers truthful in affection, as Sheikh Sharaf al-Din bin al-Farid said: 'Even if Love is mighty in it, my passion is humble... And were it not for humiliation in Love, I would have no glory.' As was said: 'Humble yourself to whom you desire to gain glory... For how much glory a man attained by humiliation.' Among them are those who see the unification of the beloved and the absence of a partner, as was said: 'There is no place in the heart for two beloveds... Nor can two manage the affair. Just as the Intellect is one and does not know... A Creator other than One, Merciful. So too the Heart is one and does not desire... Other than a single individual, distant or near. And so Religion is one, straight... And a disbeliever is one who has two religions. He is, in the law of affection, a polytheist... Far from the correctness of faith.' So whoever is contrary to this, seeing a partner in love like Al-Rashid and others as will be explained in his chapter, is not a lover in reality. This is dominant over kings due to the abundance of what they have and the variety of forms available to them, as was said: 'Move, for the pleasures of passion are in moving... And drink every pure (water), do not stop at one watering place.' For kings are not like others due to their ability over whom they love with ready cash and piled quintals of gold and silver. Yes, a great king may fall in love, but his love does not lead him to abandon the management of his kingdom. Rather, what appears most from the matter of kings is that they place their beloved in the station of their owner while they own him, as Al-Hakam bin Hisham, King of Andalusia, said: 'He remained from the excess of his love a slave (Mamluk)... While he was before that a king (Malik). The fawns of the palace left him a youth... Wandering on the ground, left alone... Placing the cheek upon soil...",

    "text": "...For the one who makes silk a couch... Thus humiliation becomes beautiful with the freeborn when passion is owned (Mamluk).' Al-Rashid said, having loved three slave girls: 'The three sociable ones possessed my rein... And settled in my heart in every place. Why does all creation obey me... While I obey them and they are in disobedience to me? That is only because the Sultan of Passion... And by it they became strong, is mightier than my Sultan.' Al-Musta'in Billah bin Al-Hakam Al-Umayyad, one of the Caliphs of the West (Andalusia), said and did well: 'Wonder! The lion fears the edge of my spear... And I fear the glance of languid eyelids. I fight terrors, not fearing... Anything from them except avoidance and abandonment. Three like statues possessed my soul... Radiant of faces, soft of bodies. I judged in them regarding consolation to Youth... So it judged with a Sultan against a Sultan. So they permitted the sanctuary of my heart and left me... In the glory of my kingdom like the suffering captive. Do not blame a king who humbled himself to Passion... The humiliation of Passion is glory and a second kingdom. What harm is it that I am their slave out of ardent love... While the sons of the time and they are my slaves?' I said: And how many like him, a conquering king and capable sultan... The heavens humble to his awe and the deadly ones submit to his power... Passion destroyed his pillars and humiliated his glory and authority. So his eyelid fell short in the long nights... And he fell with his mind, Beauty (Al-Hasan) in the captivity of detention. So he said: 'Does it not suffice you that you own me... And that all people are my slaves? And that if you cut off my hand and my foot... I would say out of satisfaction: You did well, increase it!' It was said they are by Al-Rashid, and it was said by Al-Ma'mun, and it was said by Al-Mahdi. Sheikh Athir al-Din Abu Hayyan said: Sultan Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Sultan Al-Ghalib Billah, one of the kings of Andalusia, was beautiful, of good policy, appearing religious. I saw him repeatedly in Granada and recited poetry to him and attended the recitation of poets with him. Of his poetry: 'O mistress of the howdah who took away my asceticism... In any case, I must have you. Either by humiliation, which is more fitting for Passion... Or by might, which is more fitting for Kingship.' Al-Malik Al-Amjad said: 'Who is like me in my age... My gardener in my palace. My beloved is my slave... He sang to me from my poetry.' Al-Malik Al-Zahir said regarding his Mamluk Aybak the Jamdar: 'I am the owner (Malik) of a slave (Mamluk), a tender gazelle... And among the wonders is an owner owned (Mamluk). I am the youth, although I am, regarding his union... Among creation, a destitue pauper. How much blood I shed with a sword by force... And my blood by the sword of his glances is shed.' Al-Malik Al-Ashraf said regarding his Mamluk who was his treasurer, a Dubayt (couplet): 'I ransom a moon in whom description is confused... He is generous with my blood while he is a trustworthy trustee. What wonder! He guards my wealth and sees... My soul perishing by him and does not turn.' The rest of what he has of stanzas I mentioned in Chapter One of 'Naql al-Kiram fi Madh al-Maqam', and I also mentioned therein the story of his beloved, the son of his Mamluk, and what appeared in it of his good conduct, which is among the strangest tales told about kings. King Tamim said: 'By Allah, grant me a promise of truth... And leave this coquetry from you. And do not leave me complaining... The like of your face is not complained of.' It is told that Al-Ma'mun got angry at his slave girl 'Arib al-Mughanniyah', and he was fond of her. So he turned away from her and she turned away from him. Then passion handed him over and longing unsettled him until he sent to her asking for reconciliation. When they met, she did not pay attention to him, and he spoke to her but she did not answer. So he began reciting: 'Speak, speech does not hurt you... Nor does peace detract from your beauties. I am Al-Ma'mun and the Gallant King... But I am for your love a wandering admirer. You have the right not to kill me... So the people remain having no Imam.' She said to him: 'O Commander of the Faithful, your father the Commander of the Faithful Harun Al-Rashid was more of a lover than you where he says: \"The three sociable ones possessed...\" the aforementioned verses.' The completion of her story I mentioned in Chapter Two of 'Al-Sukardan', and it is a very pleasant story. Al-Ma'mun also saw one day a beautiful boy belonging to Ahmad bin Yusuf. He said: 'What is your name?' He said: 'Fath.' Al-Ma'mun said: 'O Fath, O opener (Fatih) of my tribulation... And O Knower of the length of my complaint. Praise be to Allah, no partner has He... Your master is my slave and you are my master.' That reached Ahmad, so he gifted the boy to him. I said: So it was as was said:",

    "text": "'Everything suitable for the Master... Is forbidden to the slave.' His father Al-Rashid sat one day with Zubaydah, and her slave girls were with her. He looked at a slave girl standing at her head and signaled her to kiss him. She excused herself with her lips. He called for an inkwell and paper and signed in it: 'I kissed her from afar. She excused herself with her lips.' Then he handed her the paper, and she signed in it: 'So I did not leave my place... Until I jumped upon him.' When he read what she wrote, he asked Zubaydah to give her to him, so she gave her. He went away with her and stayed with her for a week, their place unknown. Zubaydah wrote to him: 'A lover fond of his beloved... It is as if their two hearts are a heart. Their two spirits are a spirit and their two souls... Are a soul; thus let love be.' Abu Ja'far narrated saying: While Muhammad son of Zubaydah (Al-Amin) was walking in a palace of his, he passed by a slave girl of his who was drunk, wearing a silk shawl, dragging her skirts out of pride. He solicited her for herself. She said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, you have abandoned me for a period and I did not know of your coming. So grant me respite tonight until I prepare to meet you and I will come to you tomorrow.' When morning came, he waited for her but she did not come. He stood and entered upon her and asked her to fulfill the promise. She said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, did you not know that the speech of the night is erased by the day?' He laughed and went out of his council. He said: 'Who is at the door among the poets?' It was said to him: Mus'ab, Al-Raqashi, and Abu Nuwas. He ordered for them, so they entered. When they sat before him, he said: 'Let each one of you say a poem ending with \"The speech of the night is erased by the day\".' Al-Raqashi began saying: 'When will you sober up while your heart is flown... And stability is denied so there is no stability? And a young woman who does not visit nor is visited... Has left you a wandering admirer. If you ask her to fulfill the promise... The speech of the night is erased by the day.' Mus'ab said: 'Do you blame me while my heart is flown... Depressed, no stability settles for it? For the love of a pretty one who hunted my heart... With glances mixed with intense blackness. When I extended my hand to her... To touch her, aversion appeared from her. So I said to her: Promise me a promise... She said: Tomorrow is the visit from you. When I came demanding (fulfillment), she answered... The speech of the night is erased by the day.' Abu Nuwas said: 'And a maiden came in the palace drunk... But dignity adorned the drunkenness. The robe had fallen from her shoulders... From scratching, and the wrapper came loose. The wind shook heavy buttocks... And a branch on which were small pomegranates. I intended her, and the night was a cover... So an excuse rose for her regarding the meaning. She said: Tomorrow. So I went on until... The time came in which was the visit. I said: The promise, my mistress. She said... The speech of the night is erased by the day.' He said to him: 'Woe to you! Were you looking at us or were you the third of us in the palace?' He said: 'No, by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, but I looked at you and knew what was in your soul and expressed what was in your conscience.' He ordered four thousand dirhams for him and the like for his two companions. I mentioned here what I said regarding Ibn Nahar (Son of Day): 'I say to my appointed time: Visit at night... He appeared like the full moon in it then vanished. The speech of the night, O Ibn Nahar, increases... When the sun rises upon it, it melts.' I said: 'Do you spend the night with eyelids quenched of slumber... While I spend the night awake regarding you with my night-companions? And you blame if I become, on the day of aversion... The Majnun of Laila regarding you, O Ibn Nahar?' It is told that Al-Mutawakkil had a boy named Shafi' who was one of the most beautiful youths. Al-Mutawakkil was madly in love with him. He wanted one day to drink with Husayn bin al-Dahhak and see what remained of his fame, as he had aged. He summoned him and gave him drink until he was drunk. He said to Shafi': 'Give him drink.' So he gave him drink and greeted him with a rose. Shafi' was wearing rose-colored clothes. Husayn extended his hand to Shafi's arm. Al-Mutawakkil said: 'Do you scratch the sole of my foot in my presence? How then if I were alone with him? How much you need discipline!' Al-Mutawakkil had winked at Shafi' to tease him. So he called for an inkwell and wrote: 'And like the red rose, he greeted with a flower... Of roses, walking in tunics like roses. I wished to be given a drink by his eyes... Reminding me of what I had forgotten of the covenant. May Allah water a time in which I did not spend a night... Empty, but with a beloved on a promise.' Then Shafi' gave it, and gave it to Al-Mutawakkil. He found it pleasant and said: 'You did well, O Husayn. If Shafi' were of those whose gifting is permissible, I would have gifted him to you. But by my life, O Shafi', be his cupbearer for the rest of our day.' And he ordered a lot of money for him. Shafi' used to write on the embroidery of his right coat: 'A full moon on a fresh branch... Soaked the upper chest with perfume.'",

    "text": "And he writes on the left embroidery: 'The page of his face was written... In the page of the illuminating moon.' Among the strange things told is that Yazid bin Abd al-Malik bin Marwan was enamored with Hababah his slave girl. He secluded himself one day in amusement with her and said: 'I will surely belie the saying of the one who said that time does not clear for anyone for a day.' He summoned his doorman and said to him: 'Do not allow anyone to enter upon me nor inform me of news, even if it involves the loss of my kingdom for the duration of this day.' He stayed with her in the most complete state. She took a pomegranate and choked on it, dying instantly. A bout of grief seized him, coming between him and patience. He forbade her burial until a group of Banu Umayya asked him to bury her and were gentle with him in that. So he ordered her burial and said: 'If the soul is consoled of you or leaves desire... Then by despair it is consoled of you, not by fortitude.' It was said he did not stay after her except seven days and died of sorrow over her. Similar to his action in not burying his beloved is what I recounted in 'Naql al-Kiram fi Madh al-Maqam' in Chapter Four about Sultan Jalal al-Din Khwarizm Shah. When his Mamluk Falaj died, he forbade his burial and he used to be carried with him in a litter. Whenever food was placed before him, he said: 'Carry this to Falaj.' Some Emirs said to him: 'O King, Falaj has died.' So he struck his neck. There is no power nor strength except in Allah. I mentioned the completion of his story in the mentioned book. Chapter Three: Mention of those who loved upon Hearsay and fell into conflict with the beloved. I say: We established this chapter to mention those who loved before seeing, so what happened happened when his tears flowed as they flowed. He became restless after having been content ('Qarir al-Ain'), and testified against his eyes regarding what they did not see. He was like one tasked to tie two barley grains. How many a night he danced upon hearing (Sama'), and a week of whose nights he stayed awake two, three, and four. He is of a class (different) from those who loved by touch or others of the remaining five senses. It appears that this is due to a resemblance between him and the beloved in the matter itself or a prior acquaintance in the World of Particles (Alam al-Dharr), as Sheikh Fath al-Din bin Sayyid al-Nas said in 'Al-Iqtibas': 'A love whose consolation time has not known... Flows to the soul or flows with the soul. It has no end, but its beginning is... A prior acquaintance in the Presence of Holiness. In the World of Particles the bringer of glad tidings confided it to me... Welcome to its pact, pure from filth. More desirable to the heart than safety in fear... And than the roaming of slumber in sleepy eyes.' My saying 'due to a resemblance between him and the beloved' etc., contains an indication that you do not find two who love each other except that there is resemblance and agreement between them in some attributes; this is inevitable. For this reason, Hippocrates took advantage when a man of deficiency described to him that he loved him. He said: 'He did not love me unless I agreed with him in some of his morals.' This is supported by the saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him, when he asked Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, about a woman who used to enter upon the women of Quraysh making them laugh. She arrived in Medina and stayed with a woman who made people laugh. He said: 'Upon whom did so-and-so descend?' She said: 'Upon so-and-so, the one who makes people laugh.' He said: 'Praise be to Allah, souls are conscripted soldiers; what they recognize of each other they coalesce with, and what they reject of each other they differ with.' Tarafa recited: 'The souls of men recognize each other if they meet... So among them is an enemy to be feared and a friend.' Abu al-Hudhail al-Allaf said: 'It is not permissible in the rotation of the sphere, nor in the composition of nature, nor in analogy, nor in sense, nor in the possible, nor in the necessary, that there be a lover towards whom his beloved has no inclination.' It appears that this is due to the secret we mentioned of the existence of resemblance between them. If you say: We have seen one who loved someone who does not love him nor turn to him. I say: Answers were mentioned for that, the best of which is to say Love is of two types: Type One: Purpose-driven love. Partnership is not required in this; rather, it is often met with the beloved's loathing and hatred for the lover, unless he has a purpose with him similar to his purpose, so he loves him for his purpose from him, as is between a man and a woman because each has a purpose with the companion. Type Two: Spiritual love, caused by resemblance and agreement between the two spirits. This cannot be but from both sides inevitably. If a lover with true love searched the heart of his beloved, he would find there love for him similar to his, or above it, or below it. Some mentioned that the cause of love is three things: either seeing a form, hearing a melody, or hearing a description. These three are the origin of the spring of love, as no one's love is devoid of relying on one of them. It has been said there are three loves: Love of attachment, love of flattery, and love that is killing. People's conditions differ in that. Among them are those who love by mere description without sighting, so he perishes for one described to him as a love, while he has not seen him, but a describer described him to him, as was said:",

    "text": "'I missed seeing the dwellings with my eye... So perhaps I see the dwellings with my ear.' Judge Al-Fadil took it and said: '...Distract me regarding Al-Sham (Damascus/Syria) with a mention, for my heart is full of longings for it. Memory represented it to my hearing as if... I walk there with my eyes.' Some wise men said that Allah Almighty made the Heart the commander of the body and the king of the limbs. All limbs submit to it, all senses obey it, it is their director, and by its will they emanate. Its vizier is the Intellect, its supporter is Understanding, its scout is the two Eyes, and its vanguard is the two Ears. They (Eyes and Ears) are equal in the chapter of transmission; they do not hide anything from it nor fold a secret from it. It was said to Plato: 'Which is more harmful, hearing or sight?' He said: 'They are to the heart like the two wings to the bird; it does not rise except with both of them, nor does it become independent except by their strength. Perhaps one is clipped, so it bears upon the other with fatigue and hardship.' It was said: 'So why does the blind man love without seeing, and the deaf man love without hearing?' He said to him: 'Therefore I said: The bird may rise with one of its wings but does not become independent in flight. If they gather, its going is more effective and its flight strong.' It used to be said: Love, its beginning is hearing then looking, just as the beginning of fire is smoke then sparks. It is told regarding Abu Tammam that he heard a slave girl singing in Persian, and her voice moved him. He said: 'I did not understand her meanings but... She moved my heart so I did not bear her moving. I was as if I were a blind, suffering man... Who loves beauties and does not see them.' Ibn Tahir said: I said to Abu Tammam: 'Did you take this meaning from anyone?' He said: 'Yes, from the saying of Bashar: O people, my ear is in love with some of the tribe... And the ear falls in love before the eye sometimes. They said: You desire someone you do not see? So I said to them... The ear is like the eye, it fulfills to the heart what was.' I said: It appears that Bashar took his saying from the speech of the wise man mentioned previously. Abu Ya'qub al-Khuraymi followed him and said: 'She said, mocking me the morning I met her... Oh men, regarding the youthful passion of the blind! I answered her: My soul is your ransom, truly... My eye and my ear in love are equal.' Bashar also said: Love is only generated by the heart and thought, and he recited regarding that: 'A group makes me abstain from the love of Abdah... Their hearts regarding her are contrary to my heart. So I said: Leave my heart and what it chose and approved... For by the heart, not by the eye, does the intelligent one love. And what the eyes see in the place of desire... The ears do not hear except from the heart.' Al-Husri said, and he spoke true in what he uttered: The five senses only sense by the mediation of the soul. Al-Khalil bin Ahmad said: 'If you are not with me, then the memory of you is with me... My heart observes you even if you are absent from my sight. The eye sees whom it desires and loves... And the eye of the heart is not devoid of looking.' Muzaffar bin Ibrahim the Blind said in apologizing for love despite blindness: 'They said: You loved, while you are blind... A dark fawn-eyed gazelle. And his ornaments, you have not viewed them... So you say imagination has enamored you. And his phantom is with you in sleep... But it did not visit nor descend. From where did he send an arrow to the heart... While you did not look at him? And when did you see his beauty... Until his love clothed you in illness? And by which limb did you connect... To describe him in prose and verse? While the eye is the caller of passion... And it reveals it if it completes.' So I answered that I am marked (Mawsam)... By love through listening and understanding. I love with the limb of hearing... And I do not see the essence of the named.' Al-Madani said: 'O you who blamed me for the love of... One whom my eye did not see. You have exceeded in your description... Of me in love with weakness. So say, do you know Paradise... One day by other than description?' How excellent is the saying of Al-Muhadhdhab Ibn Al-Shihna from a poem praising our Master Sultan Al-Malik Al-Nasir Salah al-Din Ayyub, beginning with: 'And I am a man who loved you for virtues... I heard of them, and the ear loves like the eye. And hopes said to me: If you are joining... The sons of Ayyub, you are the successful one.' I said from a poem praising our Master Sultan Al-Malik Al-Nasir Hasan, containing a good addition, beginning with: 'By the life of your face which is a shining full moon... My heart for you, as you knew, is compassionate. O you who, if the myrtle of his cheek-hair appears... I become having in life a leafy branch. Your cheek did not appear written on by the cheek-hair... Except I thought it was freed (Mu'taq - meaning free or aged wine).' And from it:",

    "text": "'How much I danced upon hearing his mention... And the ear before the eye, they said, falls in love.' The summary of the issue is that among people are those who fall in love upon hearing and perish in the love of one they have not seen but was described to them. For this reason, the Prophet, peace be upon him, forbade that a woman be described to other than her husband as if he is looking at her; the Hadith is in the Sahih. He said in 'Al-Wadih Al-Mubin': Among them are those who fall in love with a trace they saw. It is told that a man loved the trace of a woman's palm he saw on a wall. When his family despaired of his recovery, they left him until he died. Among them are those who love in sleep a figure they do not know, so they wander for it, as was said: 'I wish I knew who... She was and how she traveled by night. Was it the rising of the sun... That was, or is she the moon? I think the Intellect... Its management showed her. Or the form of the Soul... Thoughts showed her. For sight was bewildered in... Perceiving her. Or if it was not all this, then she is an accident... Fate brought her as a cause for my death.' Among them are those who fall in love by touch; it was said it is the head of lust. Among them are those who fall in love by smell, as was said: 'And the eye loves what it desires and sees... Likewise, the nose and the ear love in you.' Among them is one who told me that he entered a bathhouse and saw in it a long black hair of some woman and did not know whose it was. So he took it and it stayed with him for a time, and he was afflicted with the love of its owner, which brought him to the verge of destruction, as was said: 'I perished by a hair and heard another... Say: I was blinded by my destruction for a hair.' Among them are those who fall in love with a female Jinni they saw in their sleep, and she described herself to him and came to him more than once according to his claim. As Abu al-Faraj al-Umawi narrated that Ja'far al-Mansur used to love among the Jinn until his fondness for that increased, so he began to have seizures in sleep multiple times until he died of that. Abu Ja'far grieved for him severely. Ja'far was licentious and impudent. When Al-Mansur forbade Muti' bin Iyas from accompanying his son Ja'far, he said: 'And what is rectifiable in him? And what limit has he not reached in corruption?' He said: 'Woe to you! And by what is this?' He said: 'He claims he loves a woman from the Jinn and he strives to propose to her. His habit is gathering sorcerers for her, and they promise him and give him hope. By Allah, there is no virtue in him for other than that, seriousness nor jest, nor disbelief nor faith.' From his poetry regarding her: 'For the daughter of the Jinni in the tribe are traces... Effaced signs, obliterated like defects.' I said: This is regarding whom it is said: Madness has arts. Similar to this is what our companion Jamal bin Abdullah told me. He said: Al-Tha'alibi said in 'Fiqh al-Lugha': They claimed that intermarriage has occurred between Humans and Jinn due to His saying Almighty: \"And share with them in wealth and children.\" Because female Jinn strike men of Humans with love and corruption is pleasant (to them), and likewise men of Jinn to women of Adam. Section: Mention of what falls into the category of Love upon Hearsay and Testimony on the Absent. Like the saying of Dik al-Jinn, and it was said Abd al-Muhsin al-Suri: 'By my father! A mouth for which the conscience testified... Before tasting that it is sweet. Like my testimony to Allah purely... Before seeing that He is Lord.' How excellent is the saying of the other: 'I yearn for the sweetness of his saliva... As lovers yearned for Al-Udhayb. I testified for it and have not tasted it... Certainty, but from the unseen is an unseen.' Bashar bin Burd said: 'O most pleasant of people in saliva, untested... Except for the testimony of the tips of toothsticks (Miswak).' Al-Mutawakkil al-Laythi said: 'As if a pure reddish wine... Shimmering between a curtain and a jar. The teeth of Sulayma are justified by it... The physiognomy of my eye and the correctness of my guess.' Imru' al-Qais said: 'And she has a mouth, pleasant, clear... Delicious in the kissing place and the smiling place. I have not tasted it other than my guess of it... And by guess one judges what I conceal.' Ibn Hamd al-Siqilli said: 'I did not taste her mouth but I... Transmitted the testimony of the Arak wood (Miswak).' Al-Baha Zuhayr said: 'I was tempted by a sweet, pretty one, so they spoke... With a wonder: How is he sweet and salty (pretty)? The toothstick testified with me to his goodness... And I have not seen a witness (Adl) while he is overflowing drunk.' Ibn al-Naqib said: 'They said so-and-so forges lies... Clothed from his words with sweetness. Sweet of speech. So I said: Who guarantees for me... If he is truthful in sweetness (of taste)?'",

    "text": "I said: There remains here a story related to those who loved upon hearsay among the fools and the simpletons, which is what Al-Jahiz narrated. He said: I passed one day by a teacher and found him in good appearance and fine clothes. He rose to me and seated me with him. I opened a discussion with him on Readings (Qira'at), and behold he was skilled in them. I discussed with him something of Grammar, and found him skilled in it. Then in Arabic poetry and Language, and behold he was perfect in all that is desired of him. I said: By Allah, my resolve to tear up the book of teachers (stereotypes about teachers' stupidity) has strengthened. I used to sit with him and visit him every day. He said: So I came some days to visit him and found the school (Kuttab) closed. I asked his neighbors about him. They said: 'Someone died at his place.' I said: 'I will go console him.' I came to his door and knocked. His slave girl came out to me. She said: 'What do you want?' I said: 'I want your master.' She said: 'My master is sitting alone in mourning; he gives no one a way to him.' I said: 'Tell him your friend so-and-so seeks you.' She entered and came out to me and said: 'In the name of Allah.' So I crossed to him, and behold he was sitting alone. I said: 'May Allah make your reward great. \"There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern.\" This is a path that is inevitable, so upon you is patience.' Then I said to him: 'This who died, is it your son?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then your father?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then your brother?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then who?' He said: 'My beloved.' I said to myself: 'This is the first of the misfortunes.' Then I said: 'Glory be to Allah, women are many and you will find another and your eyes will fall on one more beautiful.' He said: 'And as if you thought I had seen her?' I said to myself: 'This is a second misfortune.' Then I said: 'And how did you love one whom you did not see?' He said: 'Know that I was in the balcony (Taramah) and suddenly a man passed singing and saying: \"O Umm Amr, may Allah reward you with a bounty... Return to my heart wherever it was.\" I said to myself: Were it not that this Umm Amr has no equal in the world, this poetry would not have been said about her. So I loved her. Two days later, that man passed singing and saying: \"The donkey went away with Umm Amr... So she did not return, nor did the donkey return.\" So I knew she died, so I grieved and sat in mourning for three days for this day.' Al-Jahiz said: So my resolve returned and my determination strengthened to tear up the book (about teachers' intelligence) because of the story of Umm Amr. Chapter Four: Mention of those who looked the first look and burned from the cheek of the beloved with an ember. I say: We established this chapter to mention those whom looking dropped into the harm leading to sleeplessness, for it is the caller of insomnia and the fuel of burning. How often it called to the prohibited intercourse by consensus! It is a poisoned arrow and a blameworthy act. In its beginning, its rectification is possible, and its captive hopes for release. But if repeated, it leads to what is described as such and such. Do you not see the rope by its repetition cutting the house (stone)? As was said: 'All incidents, their beginning is from looking... And the bulk of the fire is from small sparks. How many a look wreaked havoc in the heart of its owner... The havoc of arrows without a bow or string. A man, as long as he has an eye he turns... Among eyes, is standing in danger. His eye pleases what harms his soul... No welcome to a pleasure that came with harm.' My saying 'And in its beginning, its rectification is possible' etc., that is because a man passes by a woman, and her apparent appearance, shape, and form are compatible with his nature, so his soul stirs and his interest is aroused from the first look. If his look at her is repeated, his love for her increases. If he sits until he sees her, what is in him becomes double what it was. If she looks at him once, he is tempted by her beauty and falls into the captivity of her ropes and enters the number of lovers. This supports the saying of those who held that Love is voluntary because he did not become a lover except after the occurrence of these introductions, and it was possible for him to cut off the material of that after the first look, except in rare cases as preceded in the mention of the women who died when they saw Joseph, peace be upon him, so they were tempted from the first look. It used to be said looking from the lover is an urgent death and from the beloved is a killing arrow. It used to be said many a love was planted by a glance and a war harvested by a word. It used to be said whoever releases his glance increases his regret. It used to be said whoever's glances are many, his sorrows endure. A Bedouin said: Love is a plant whose seed is looking, its water is visiting, its growth is union, its killing is abandonment, and its harvest is accusation. Al-Suri said: 'You planted desire with a glance then belittled it... And neglected it, getting familiar, lenient. You did not know until its trees ripened... And the winds of passion blew in it impregnating. So you became drawing patience near from a distance... Upon you, and summoning sleep from afar.'",

    "text": "Al-Asma'i said: I was at some Arab waters and heard people saying: 'She has come.' People moved, so I stood with them. Behold, a young girl had arrived at the water; I had never seen her like in the beauty of her face and the perfection of her creation. When she saw the abundance of people looking at her, she let down her veil, so it was like a cloud covering a sun. I said: 'Why do you prevent us from looking at this beautiful face of yours?' She recited saying: 'And you were, whenever you sent your glance as a scout... For your heart one day, the scenes tired you. You saw what you are not capable of entirely... Nor are you patient regarding some of it.' Then a Bedouin looked at her and said: 'I, by Allah, am of those whose patience is little.' And he recited: 'O wild one of the eyes, where is the family for you... Did they settle in the rugged ground or is their place the plain? And which land brought you out, for I... See you from Paradise if the origin is searched. Stop and tell us what you ate and what... You drank and from where the caravan departed with you. Because the signs of Paradises are clear upon you... Even if the form resembles the form.' I say: This, by Allah, is the lawful magic and the sweet fresh water. It contained the school of speech magic and the sublime full moon. As if I am with her and she has mentioned the family to him and described of her tribe and her cheek the rugged and the plain. There, he comes to her striving on his head, not striving on foot, and her cheeks are more beloved to him than red camels. And he recites: 'Show me the place of the full moon if the full moon sets... And stand in the place of the sun if the dawn is far. For in you is the sun's light... And it (the sun) does not have your smiling and mouth (Thaghr).' It is told that a singer entered Isfahan singing these two verses: 'Listen, O servants of Allah, to me... And desist from observing the beauties. For love, its end is death... And its beginning resembles jesting.' I said: In this is evidence that the Eye is what brings the Time (of death). Since it is so, let us mention here a debate that occurred between the Heart and the Eye, and the blaming of each of them by its companion, and the judgment between them. When the Eye was excessive and the Heart's love excessive, and this (Eye) had the pleasure of looking and that (Heart) had the pleasure of triumph, they were in Love partners in the rein and two horses in a race. When they fell into sleeplessness and burning, and insomnia harmed their owner, the Heart spoke. Al-Arjani says to his criminal glance: 'You two enjoyed, O my eyes, a look... And brought my heart to the most evil of watering places. O my eyes, desist from my heart, for it is... Of injustice, the striving of two in killing one.' Abu al-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi said: 'And I am the one whose glance attracted death... So who is the demanded, and the killed is the killer?' Another's saying: 'My heart was punished and my eye committed the crime... And perhaps the one who did not commit the crime is punished.' Another's saying: 'The looking of eyes at eyes is what... Made destruction a path to the heart. Glances ceased not to raid his heart... Until he wallowed among them, slain.' Another's saying: 'O you who sees my illness increasing... And my ailment baffled my doctor. Do not wonder, for thus... Eyes commit crimes against hearts.' Ibn Mudrik said: 'I wounded with my glance the cheek of the beloved... So the acting Eye was not demanded. But he exacted retribution from my soul... Thus are blood monies upon the female clan ('Aqilah).' When the Eye heard his recitation and understood his intent, she signaled to him and began denying him. She said: 'Oh wonder at an oppressor complaining and a mute speaking! Is it not from the news that spread and circulated that you are the King and we are the followers? You send me in what you want like lightning and follow that with threats. Did you not hear the saying of Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him: The heart is a King and the limbs are his soldiers; if the King is good, his soldiers are good, and if the King is bad, his soldiers are bad. And the Master of Mankind said, upon him be the best blessings and peace: In the body is a morsel, if it is sound, the whole body is sound, and if it is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt. So between my sin and your sin at that time is as between my blindness and your blindness. The Knower of the Unseen said: \"For indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded, but blinded are the hearts.\"' When the Soul heard the argument that revolved between them, she said immediately: 'I am between two enemies... They are my heart and my glance. The glance looks and the heart desires... And the intention is my death.' Another said: 'My heart says to my glance when it wept in anxiety... You cry while you are the one who burdened me with the pain? So my glance said to it while scolding it: Rather you burdened me with hopes and greed... Until when each was alone with his companion. Both of them were content with long illness... My liver called out to them: Do not blame, for indeed...",

    "text": "...You have cut me with what you encountered into pieces.' Another said: 'I blamed my heart when... I saw my body emaciated. So the heart stuck it to my glance... And said: You were the messenger. My glance said to my heart... Rather you were the guide. So I said: Enough, both of you... You have left me slain.' I said: So they were as the commoners say: A back of the neck between two slappers. How excellent is the saying of the other: 'By Allah, I do not know: my soul should I blame... For love, or my eye is wounded, or my heart? If I blame my heart, it says to me: The eye saw... And if I blame my eye, it says: The sin is the heart's. So my eye and my heart have shared in my blood... So O Lord, be a help against the eye and the heart.' Section: On the mention of the magic of eyes and the arrows of eyelids. I said: And the Judge between them is the one who judges between the Spirit and the Body if they dispute, as reported in the tradition from the Master of Humans: 'Dispute will not cease on the Day of Resurrection between creatures until the Spirit and the Body dispute. The Body says to the Spirit: You are the one who moved me, ordered me, and directed me, otherwise I would not have moved nor done anything without you. So the Spirit says to it: And you are the one who ate, drank, and enjoyed, so you are the one deserving punishment. So Allah Glorified and Exalted sends an angel to judge between them. He says: Your likeness is like a paralyzed seer and a blind walker who entered a garden. The paralyzed said to the blind: I see fruits in it but cannot stand. The blind said: I can stand but see nothing. The paralyzed said: Come, carry me; so you walk and I reach. Upon whom is the punishment? They say: Upon both of them. He says: So likewise are you.' Section: Mention of the magic of eyelids and the arrows of eyes. Of that is the saying of Bashar, which is the most flirtatious verse poets have said according to what the Chief Judge Shams al-Din bin Khallikan recounted: 'I, by Allah, desire the magic of your two eyes... And fear the death-grounds of lovers.' Our Sheikh, the Hafiz Shams al-Din al-Dhahabi, transmitted in 'Tarikh al-Islam' from Ibn Hayyus that he said: The most flirtatious I know is the saying of Abd al-Muhsin al-Suri: 'By the One who inspired my torment... Your front teeth (sweetness). What did your eyes say... To my heart so it answered?' I said: They are from the saying of Jarir: 'Indeed, the eyes in whose glance is intense contrast (Hawar)... Killed us then did not revive our dead. They strike down the one of intellect until there is no movement in him... While they are the weakest of Allah's creation as humans.' The author of 'Al-Murqis wal-Mutrib' recited: 'If I did not die by the glance, the blamer said... What is the value of the sword that does not kill?' Ibn Sahl al-Ishbili said in the opening of his Muwashshah: 'Her glances for killing... Have in her ball the fullest share. She shoots and all of me is a killing spot... And all of it is a hitting arrow.' King Al-Nasir Dawood, Lord of Karak, said: 'By my father! A slender one, if I sought from him... Kissing a mouth, he repels me from my intent. He protected his cheek with a wall of cheek-hair... His eyes became upon it my archers (Marami).' Section: Description of Narrow Eyes and others. Ibn al-Nabih said: 'He repels with his Turkish glance from me... You spoke truth, indeed narrowness of the eye is stinginess.' He also said: 'From the sons of the Turks, soft of side, hard of heart... Easy of deception, difficult of docking. Narrow of eye, which is an attribute of stinginess... So if he is generous, it is against analogy (Qiyas): He drew the bow so his cheeks were clothed... In a robe of roses whose embroidery is myrtle. And he shot from two bows two arrows, this one... In my heart and that one in the target.' Ibn Qarnas said: 'I was attached to a Tatar... And he grieves hearts with his separation. Generosity is not hoped from him... In union, due to the narrowness of his eye.' Sheikh Jamal al-Din bin Nubata said: 'The blamer was confounded when he saw his glances... Turkish, leaving the forbearing one foolish. So he turned the blame and said: Take him and the sorrow... These are narrows (straits) I do not enter.' Sheikh Safi al-Din al-Hilli said: 'I have a fawn among them, if I flirted with him... His glances almost spoke with magic. If he wishes to meet me with a wide character... At the meeting, a narrow eye forbids him.' Al-Khara'iti told about some Alawite who said: While I was standing over Al-Hasan ibn Hani (Abu Nuwas) while he was reciting: 'Woe to me upon the wide of eyes... The buxom, the slim of bellies. Those speaking upon the conscience... To us with the tongues of eyelids.'",

    "text": "A Bedouin stood over him with a son of his and said: 'Repeat to me.' So he repeated to him. He said: 'O nephew, woe to you alone from this? Woe to me and you, and woe to this son of mine, and woe to this group, and woe to all our neighbors.' Sibt al-Ta'awidhi said: 'Between swords and his eye is a partnership... For its sake scabbards were called eyelids (Ajfan).' Rashid al-Din al-Fariqi said: 'Indeed in your eyes is a meaning... The narcissus spoke of. Would that I had from its freshness... An arrow, then in my heart from it.' Muhammad bin al-Afif al-Tilimsani said: 'Your glances are masculine swords, so why do they... As they claimed, possess the like of widows?' And he also said: 'O lovers, beware... Of one smiling from his mouth. For his enchanting glance, since... You doubted his command. Wants to drive you out... From your land with his magic.' He also said: 'Judges of Beauty! What is my doing with a glance... The nurtured fawn wished for its like? It shot and hit my heart, a judicial effort... You spoke truth, every Mujtahid (striver) is right.' I said from my poetry: 'A beloved descending in every heart... And the sword of his glance loves combat. He sees the killing of the lover without proof... Especially if he shows coquetry. If you faced the sword of the glance from him... You would see death from its sharpness immediately.' I also said from a poem: 'The sun is jealous of her when she appears... Like the Ban branch in green garments. With fingertips red from henna... And glances black like Indian swords.' I also said from a poem: 'His glances swore against the people of passion... That they would see no killing without a sword. He gazes while the sword of his glance is in his eyelid... Sharp of edge and not touched by kohl. So if he strips it for the lover, do not ask... About a sword of an eyelid like a stripped sword.' I also said from a poem: 'My gazelle raided me with glances because... If he appears in the heat of war, he is a lion. His glances speak to me with their swords... And you have not seen before me a dead man speaking.' I said from a poem: 'She draws swords from the glances of her eye... But the habit of the eyelid is sheathing. She strips them while the tears are flowing like the Nile... So she did not bend me except Sayhan (river) was frozen.' I also said from a poem: 'He gazes at me with an eye whose eyebrow is a Nun... Like the bow piercing the targets while it twangs. A Prince of Beauty from the Turks, his eyebrow (Hajib)... Over the lover of him in Egypt has authority (Sultan). His glances raided the people of Egypt just as... Ghazan raided the people in the land of Sham.' As for Hawar (Intense whiteness and blackness of eye), people differed regarding it. Abu Ubaida said: The Hawra is the one intense in the whiteness of the eye in intensity of the blackness of its black. Ya'qub said: Hawar is the wideness of the eye, the largeness of the eyeball, and the abundance of whiteness. Qutrub said: The Hawra is the one with beautiful eye-sockets, whether the eye is small or large. Abu Amr said: The Hawra doe is the black-eyed one with no whiteness in her eye; this does not occur in humans, only in wild animals. The derivation of Hawar indicates the correctness of what Ya'qub and Abu Ubaida said, because they mostly apply it to whiteness, like the Huwari flour (fine white flour). Rarely does whiteness of the eye coincide except with intensity of its blackness, because its whiteness with blueness is not there in purity. Poets have abounded in describing the eye with Hawar and blackness, and the description of the blue eye is rare in their poetry. However, it came in the Hadith of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: \"Blueness in the eye is a blessing (Yumn).\" Some Arabs said: 'I love you if they say in your eye is blueness... Likewise the falcons of birds, their eyes are blue.' From here Al-Abdi took his saying when Mu'awiyah said to him: 'You are red.' He said: 'And gold is red.' He said: 'You are blue (eyed).' He said: 'And the hawk is blue.'

    "text": "I say: We established this chapter to mention the changing of the two lovers' colors when eye falls upon eye, and the blood flees to the net of the brain, so the barrier says to it: Where to? Doctors have stated the text regarding the cause of that, and cleared the blackness of every dark (night) from the yellowing of the lover and the reddening of the beloved. I present here what they said verbatim, and set it like the gemstone in the ring, and follow it with the mention of the colors of beauties with the best explanation and clearest clarification. This, along with what is dragged in the tail of that regarding the detail between browns and whites, and the falling of the lover of plumpness of hair and buttocks into the long and wide (trouble). I conclude that with a section on mentioning what afflicts the lover of palpitations of his heart and the flight of his mind and core. So I say, and success is through Allah. Some doctors said: The cause of the yellowing of the lover's face is fear, for blood does not settle with fear. Perhaps the beloved looks at the lover suddenly, so his heart palpitates and the heat ignites then extinguishes. If it extinguishes, the pericardium cools. If the pericardium cools, the blood congeals and the color transforms to blackness and greenness, then settles and becomes yellow. As for the reddening of the beloved's face, it is from shame. Shame is a symptom of the movement of the heart's pericardium; it transforms the blood and refines it, so it appears in the thinnest place in the face. That is upon the treatment of the accidental heat and its struggling with the blood when it is pushed, seeking escape until it reaches below the head, so the barrier prevents it from passing through, so it descends to the face, and the face reddens. They said: The face with thin skin and clear surface, if it feels shame, it reddens, and if it fears, it yellows. From it is their saying 'Brocade of the Face', meaning its coloring due to its thinness. The poet said: 'Redness mixed with yellowness in whiteness... Like what a weaver of brocade wove.' They said: The redness of a human's color is generated by joy, health, and grace. The yellowness of his color is generated by fear, misery, grief, and illness. As for the best of colors, it is red, evidenced by the fact that blood is the friend of the soul and redness is its color. The best and most luxurious ruby is the red. The best gold is its red. The best honey is the golden and ruby-colored. The earth is praised by the redness of the soil. The noblest horses are the sorrel (blonde/red), and gold is its brocade. The noblest camels are the red ones, which the Prophet, peace be upon him, said while magnifying the value of that: 'Even if I had the red camels,' and 'Even if I had the earth full of gold.' The best flowers are the rose, the anemone, and the pomegranate blossom. The best dyed garments are the safflower-dyed, and the best of them is what is dyed with crimson (Kermes). The best wine is the red; therefore poets described it with the color of fire, dragon's blood, safflower, ruby, and 'Abqar. The best of created colors is fire. For that reason, Abd al-Uzza bin Abd al-Muttalib was nicknamed Al-Lahab (The Flame), and he was nicknamed before that Abu Utbah, because he was one of the most handsome people in face, and they used to compare the redness of his face to the flame of fire because he was radiant of face, glowing. As the Prophet, peace be upon him, hinted that he said: 'The two reds destroyed men, and the red things destroyed women.' The two reds are wine and meat. The red things are gold, saffron, and wine. Wine and meat: The poet said: 'Indeed the three reds wasted... My money, and I was of old fond of them: Wine, fat meat, and what is painted... With saffron; so I remain startled.' The Prophet, peace be upon him, liked the red bird. Wahb bin Abdullah said: 'I have not seen a person with a forelock in a red suit more handsome than the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him.' Al-Mutanabbi said: 'Of the fawns in the guise of Bedouins... Red of ornaments, mounts, and robes.' As for the poet's saying: 'White (Hijan) upon her is redness in her whiteness... She pleases the eyes with it, and beauty is red,' he meant by it the beauty in the redness of color with whiteness, excluding other colors. Ibn Abd Rabbihi said: Beauty is red. The description might be struck in it due to long staying in the universe and anointing with perfume. A Bedouin said: 'I was not consoled regarding a yellow one adorned... Like ivory, nothing yellowed her but saffron (Wars) and perfume.' Another said: 'As if the color of eggs in the hatching place... Is your color were it not for the yellowness of the Jawi.' He means she anoints herself with Jawi, which is saffron, and the description of the egg does not reach its yellowness. They said the beautiful girl colors like the coloring of the sun; she is white in the forenoon and yellow in the evening like the day. The poet said: 'White is her morning and yellow... The evening like the day.' Bashar bin Burd said: 'So take beauties of adornment... And safflower-dyed ones, they are more splendid. If we reach (maturity), then enter... Into the red ones; beauty is red.' Al-Hariri said in 'Durrat al-Ghawwas': As for their saying 'Beauty is red', its meaning is that what possesses beauty is not acquired except by enduring hardship from which the face turns red. Just as they called the drought year 'Red'. They alluded to the difficult matter as 'Red Death', as was said:",

    "text": "'If your eyes see a black gaze... Know that there is a red death.' The best adornment of women on their bodies is dye (Henna), and for that poets elaborated on it and compared it to jujube and other things. Abu Nuwas said regarding it: 'O moon I saw at a funeral... Mourning with grief among peers. Weeping, so shedding pearls from narcissus... And slapping the rose with jujube.' Ibn Ukasha said: 'From the palm of a girl whose fingertips seem... Of silver, collared with jujube.' How excellent is the saying of Al-Wawa al-Dimashqi: 'So she rained pearls from narcissus and watered a rose... And bit on the jujube with hail (teeth).' Al-Marzubani said: Ibn Durayd told me: I stayed up one night. When it was the end of the night, I closed my eyes. I saw a tall man, yellow-faced, with a sparse beard, entering upon me. He took the door jambs and said: 'Recite to me the best of what you said regarding wine.' I said: 'Abu Nuwas left nothing for anyone.' He said: 'I am more poetic than him.' I said: 'Who are you?' He said: 'I am Ibn Najiyah from the people of Sham.' And he recited to me: 'And red before mixing, yellow after it... Appeared between robes of narcissus and anemone. It imitated the cheek of the beloved pure, so they imposed... A mix upon it, so it clothed itself in the color of a lover.' I said: 'You arranged badly.' He said: 'Why?' I said: 'Because you said \"And red\" presenting the red, then said \"between robes of narcissus and anemone\" delaying the redness. Why did you not present it over the other?' He said: 'What is this scrutiny at this time, O hateful one?' Then he left. Al-Mutanabbi said: 'She said, having seen my yellowing: Who is with him?... And she sighed, so I answered her: The Sigher.' The other took it and said: 'She said to a peer with her, denying... My standing: Who is this we see? She said: A youth complaining of passion, enslaved... She said: With whom? She said: With whom? She said: With whom?' Ibn al-Nabih said: 'And in the red tent is a white young girl... With blue eyes the brown spears protect her tents.' Imad al-Din Ibn Dabuqa said from verses: 'I see the necklace on his chest tight... Showing the sound ones from the jewel. And the completion of beauty is its clarification... We narrated it from your radiant face. And the scattering of my tears became red... Upon the myrtle of your green cheek-hair. And I sold my guidance for the error of desire... For your sake, O rising of Jupiter.' I said from a poem: 'By your life, there is no Zaid nor Amr... Nor a mouth, except beneath kissing it is a mouth (Thaghr). No whites except my luck is black with her... Nor browns except beneath her brown sides.' Badr al-Din bin al-Muhaddith said: 'My color turns yellow when I look at a cheek... From which the fresh rose learns its beauty. Time perishes while his love does not perish... And I have bent while I do not see him bending.' It is told about Abu Ayyub, the Vizier of Al-Mansur, that when Al-Mansur called him, he would turn yellow and tremble. When he left his presence, his color would return. It was said to him: 'We see you, despite your frequent entry upon the Commander of the Faithful and his intimacy with you, change when you enter upon him.' He said: 'My likeness and your likeness in this is like a falcon and a rooster debating. The falcon said to the rooster: I know none less loyal to his owners than you. He said: How? He said: You are taken as an egg, your family incubates you, and you emerge on their hands. They feed you with their palms until when you grow up, no one approaches you but you fly from here to there and scream. Even if you ascend a wall of a house you were in for years, you fly from it and leave it for another. As for me, I am taken from the mountains when I have grown old. My eyes are sewn, I am fed little, kept awake and prevented from sleep. I am tamed for a day and two days, then released upon the prey alone, so I fly to it, take it, and come to my owner.' The rooster said to him: 'The argument is gone from you. By Allah, if you saw two falcons on a skewer, you would never return to them. And I see the skewers full of roosters every day. So do not be forbearing at the anger of another. If you knew of Al-Mansur what I know, you would be in a worse state than me when he seeks you.' I said: And what he fled from, he fell into, according to the correct famous (report). He did not cease to turn yellow from him until he made him taste the red death. This was after he took his wealth and left him in the worst state. It is told that he used to oil his eyebrow with an oil in which Al-Mansur is enchanted, so he cannot (harm) him if he sees him, until he became a proverb, so it was said: 'Oilier than Abu Ayyub.' That availed him nothing, because he did to him what he did and met him with what he had no power against. Section: Preference between Whites and Blacks, and Browns with Breasts. This last type is what Egyptians are inclined to mostly. And people have schools of thought in what they adore. What was said in preferring Browns: 'I do not love the white puffed with fat... But I love the lean browns.",

    "text": "'I am a man who rides the lean colt in... The day of the race, so leave me and ride the elephant.' Ali bin al-Jahm said: 'And a faulter of the Browns out of his ignorance... O you who prefer the Whites, possessing contention. Say to him: Leave us! Are you not ashamed... Of making camphor like musk?' Abu Ja'far al-Shatranji said: 'Musk resembles you and you resemble it... Standing in its color, sitting. No doubt since you two are one... That you are from a single clay.' Al-Sharif Al-Radi said in detailing the Blacks: 'I love you, O color of blackness, for I... Saw you in the eyes and the heart as twins. And the arrow of the eye would not have been, were it not for its blackness... To reach the grains of the hearts when it shot. If you love the dark-lipped fawns, do not blame... My madness over the fawn that is all dark-lipped.' Maslamah said: 'The blamers blamed regarding a jet-black one... As if she is a statue in the blackness of the heart. People fell in love with the mole, and did not know... That I wander in love with a person who is entirely a mole.' Ibn Rashiq said: 'Beauty called by you, so answer... O musk in dye and scent. Haughtily rise above the Whites and lengthen... The pride of youth over greyness. And let not blackness of color frighten you... Like the eye of the nurtured fawn.' Another said: 'Indeed the blackness of the eye in the eye is its light... And the whiteness of the eye has no light, so know.' I mentioned the rest of what was said in this type of excellent stanzas in 'Al-Sukardan' when mentioning Al-Malik Al-Kamil Sha'ban, may Allah have mercy on him. As for what was said in preferring Whites over Blacks, it is more than can be mentioned by a witness or a helper's arm extended to it. Al-Jahiz said: Arabs praise with whiteness and satirize with blackness. But perhaps they praised with blackness, but the principle they build their matter upon is dispraising it. Kushajim said: 'O you who resembles in his deed his color... You did not exceed what the division necessitated. Your character is extracted from your creation... And injustice (Zulm) is derived from darkness (Zulmah).' As for the short, thick woman, she is a blameworthy type according to the owner of every prose and verse. The poet said: 'You are the one who made every short one beloved... To me, and the short ones did not feel that. I meant the short ones of the chambers, and did not intend... The short of women, the worst of women are the Buhatir.' The Buhatir are the short thick ones. Some of the predecessors said: Allah placed splendor and rashness with tallness, and cunning and ugliness with shortness, and goodness is between that. How witty is the saying of Al-Sharif the Copyist: 'Alas for the love of a short one... In the earth she has a thousand thousand statures. If her glance looks at the light letters (Khaffaf)... The rhymes say: Writer of Safety.' Some people prefer fat ones and say: Fatness is half of beauty; it covers every defect in a woman and shows her beauties. It was said for this reason she was called 'Jamila' because the Jamila is the fat one, from Jamal which is fat (Shahm). This has been mentioned previously. Section: Mention of what afflicts the lover of yellowing of his color upon seeing his beloved, and palpitations of his heart and flight of his mind and core. The author of 'Rawdat al-Muhibbin' said: It was disputed regarding the cause of this fright, fear, and disturbance. It was said its cause is that the beloved has authority over the heart of his lover greater than the authority of the subjects (over them). If he sees him suddenly, that frightens him just as one who sees someone he magnifies suddenly is frightened. For the heart magnifies the beloved, submissive to him. A person, if the magnified one surprises him, is frightened by that. It was said its cause is the opening of the heart to him and its hastening to receive him, so the blood flees from it, so it cools and trembles, and disturbance and trembling occur, and perhaps he dies. In summary, this is a matter of taste and feeling (Wijdani), even if its cause is not known. Among the best said in apologizing for the heart's palpitations upon seeing the beloved is the saying of Al-Warraq al-Khatiri: 'He says to me when he arrived: You attained what you hope for. So why does your heart, when I came... Palpitations afflict it? I said: Your union is a wedding... And the heart dances in it.' Similar is the saying of the other: 'Do not deny the palpitations of my heart... While the beloved is present with me. The heart is but his house... In which the drums of good news were beaten for him.' How excellent is the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk: 'By Allah, were it not for fear of your anger... What I encounter from your tribe would be easy for me. You possessed the two palpitating ones (East and West/Heart) and boasted in wonder... Yet they are nothing but my heart and your earring.' Mu'in al-Din said: 'I did not forget him when he said: Where do you settle me... Fearful for me of the phantom knocking? I answered: In my heart. So he said in wonder... Have you seen your life dwelling in a palpitating (Khofiq)?'",

    "text": "Another said: 'And you dwelt in a palpitating heart... Despairingly, as we were in other than a dweller.' Al-Tughra'i said: 'The breeze fell ill and recovered, and the disease which... I complain of, no separation is hoped for it. This is the flashing of lightning, and the disease which... My ribs enclosed is palpitating (Khaffaq).' Ibn al-Abbar cited in 'Tuhfat al-Qadim': 'Until when the year of slumber inclined with him... I moved him slightly while he was embracing me. I distanced him from ribs that yearn for him... So that he does not sleep on a palpitating pillow.' Then he said: Some people of our age attributed Ibn Taqi to roughness in his saying 'I distanced him from ribs that yearn for him'. Had he said... 'I distanced from him ribs that yearn for him', it would have been better. Then he mentioned after it what they preferred over the saying of Ibn Taqi mentioned, the saying of Ibn al-Hakam Ja'far bin Anan: 'If there must be slumber... Then take my ribs for a pillow. And sleep on their palpitating quietly... Like the child in the rocking of the cradle.' Ibn al-Athir said in 'Al-Mathal al-Sa'ir' regarding the verses of Ibn Taqi mentioned: This is of beauty and prettiness in the utmost place. His meanings were light on the hearts until they almost danced a dance. The last verse is the one described with innovation, and by it and its likes the eyes acknowledged the merit of hearing. I said, agreeing with the people of that age in refuting Ibn Taqi: 'A visitor came resembling the crescent moon... And followed it with aversion and elongation. I said to him... He said: No, no... Prolonging the union inherits boredom for you.' Chapter Six: Mention of Jealousy, and what it contains of confusion and the knocking of the tooth of Dik al-Jinn. I say: We established this chapter to mention the jealousy of the lover over the beloved even from himself and the sons of his gender. Lovers in it are two types, and those beaten by its whips are two kinds. The first is loved by Allah and His Messenger, and by it the messenger is completed for the lover. The second is blameworthy and its owner is blamed. The loved type of it is to be jealous when suspicion arises. The blameworthy type is to be jealous without suspicion, but from mere bad thought. This jealousy corrupts love and leaves not a grain of it, because it causes enmity between the lover and the beloved, and perhaps drives him to fall into what he accused him of. Many corruptions result from it leading to the corruption of the image. The stories in this chapter are famous. The Prophet, peace be upon him, narrated in the Sahih: \"There is jealousy that Allah loves and there is that which Allah hates. The jealousy Allah loves is to be in suspicion, and the jealousy Allah hates is jealousy without suspicion.\" Abdullah bin Shaddad said: Jealousy is two jealousies: jealousy by which a man reforms his family, and jealousy that enters the Fire. The author of 'Rawdat al-Muhibbin' said: He who loves Allah and His Messenger is jealous for Allah and His Messenger according to the measure of his love and reverence. If his heart is devoid of jealousy for Allah and His Messenger, he is far from lovers. So he lied who claimed love for a beloved among people while he sees another violating his sanctity, striving to harm and anger him, and belittling his command, and he is not jealous for that, rather his heart is cold. So how can it be correct for a servant to claim the love of Allah while he is not jealous for His prohibitions when they are violated, nor for His rights when they are wasted? And the least of states is that he be jealous for Him from himself by leaving the commission of His disobediences and negligence in His right. As for jealousy over the beloved, it is praised where exclusivity with him is praised and partnership in him is dispraised legally and rationally, like a man's jealousy over his wife and his slave girl and the thing he specifically owns. This jealousy is specific to created beings and is not conceivable regarding the Creator, because He, Glory be to Him, it is obligatory upon all creatures to love Him, remember Him, worship Him, and praise Him. Contrary to some ignorant Sufis who, if they saw someone mentioning Allah or loving Him, became jealous of him, and perhaps silenced him if possible, saying 'The jealousy of Love carries me to this.' That is only envy, transgression, aggression, a type of enmity to Allah, and opposition to the path of His messengers, which they brought out in the mold of jealousy and compared His love to the love of a form. This jealousy is only good in the love of one in whom partnership in love is not good, like a human's jealousy over his beloved among humans as previously mentioned. Al-Qushayri said: It was said to some: Do you love to see Him? He said: No. It was said: Why? He said: I declare that Beauty above the look of my like.",

    "text": "Sheikh Shams al-Din Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya said: This is also a corrupt jealousy. The utmost for its owner is to be pardoned, and for that to be counted among his blameworthy surface expressions (Shathat), and to be counted among his virtues and merits that it be said to him: Do you love to see your beloved? And he says No. No? While His vision is the highest bliss of Paradise, and He, Glory be to Him, loves for His servant to ask Him for the look at Him. It has been established from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that it was among his supplications: 'O Allah, I ask You for the pleasure of looking at Your face and the longing to meet You.' The saying of this sayer 'I declare that Beauty above the look of my like' is from the deceptions of Satan and the soul. It is similar to what is told about some that it was said: Do you not mention Him? He said: I declare Him above that His mention should run on my tongue. Some fell into something of that, so they blamed him, and he recited: 'They say visit us and fulfill the duty of our right... But my state has dropped their rights from me. If they saw my state and did not disdain it... And did not disdain me, I disdained them for myself.' And some of them left Hajj out of jealousy for His House that his like should visit it. I blamed a person for leaving prayer. He said to me: I do not see myself worthy to enter His house. So look at Satan's playing with these. As for jealousy over the beloved among humans, we have types in it, and good deeds mostly sins. Among them are those who are jealous over the beloved from the passing breeze or hearing that he is in the path: 'I become jealous if I hear a moan in the tribe... Cautious or fearful that it might be for his love.' Another said: 'Her protectors are jealous of the visiting phantom... And her jealous one gets angry at the breeze.' Ibn al-Athir said in 'Al-Mathal al-Sa'ir': I traveled to Sham in the year five hundred eighty-seven and entered the city of Damascus. I found a group of its masters fond of a verse of poetry by Ibn al-Khayyat, which is: 'I become jealous if I hear a moan in the tribe...' the aforementioned verse. I said to them: This verse is taken from the saying of Abu al-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi: 'If I said to the yearning sick one: I ransom him... From what ails him, I would tempt him with his ransom.' And Al-Mutanabbi took it from the saying of Al-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf: 'I did not meet a possessor of sorrow revealing his love... Except I thought you were that beloved. Caution for you, while I am confident in you... That other than me obtains a share of you.' Among them are those who join in jealousy their day with their yesterday, and are jealous over the beloved from their own words, as Al-Buhturi said: 'I envy my glance upon you... Until I close my eyes when I look at you. And I see you striding in your characteristics which... Are my temptation, so I am jealous of you from you. And if I could, I would prevent your utterance out of jealousy... So that I do not see it kissing your lips. Passion became pure for you and my affection chose you... Until I became jealous of you from your owning you.' Among them are those who are jealous over him... from his buttons and wearing his wrapper (Izar). 'I see the buttons on Laila so I envy them... Indeed the buttons over what they embrace are envied.' I said: For this verse is a pleasant story, which is what is told about Al-Hasan bin Zaid, the Emir of Medina. He said one day to Abu al-Sa'ib—and he had beautified him and clothed him so he would ride with him in his procession, and he greeted women if he passed by them, so the Emir forbade him from that. He rode with him one day wearing a tall cap (Qalansuwah) and did as was his habit. So the Emir recited to him: 'I see the buttons on Laila...' the verse. Abu al-Sa'ib said to him: 'May my father and mother be your ransom. Who said this verse?' He said: 'Qays.' So Abu al-Sa'ib lagged behind from riding with him, then caught up with no cap on him. The Emir said to him: 'Where is the cap?' He said: 'I gave it as charity to the devil who cast this verse on the tongue of Qays.' Among them are those who are jealous over him from sipping wine, as Kushajim said: 'And a branch in a dune (figure) tortured me... Softness and compactness shared in him. I became jealous when he brought a cup near his mouth... Over pearls being kissed by glass. And I fear if the lamp nears him... For a full moon being faced by a lamp.' Al-Mutanabbi took it and said regarding his praised one: '...I am jealous of the glass when it runs on the lip of the Emir Abu Husayn.' He was faulted for that because he addressed his praised one with what the beautiful woman is addressed with. Among them are those who place themselves in the position of the stranger, so they are jealous over the beloved from themselves, as Abu Tammam said: 'By my soul! Regarding whom I am jealous from myself... And I envy an eye that looked at him. And if I were able, I would obliterate from him... The eyes of people out of my caution for him. A beloved who spread his desire in my body... And held my soul as a pledge with him. So my spirit is with him and the body is empty... Without a spirit, and my heart is in his hands.' He also said:",

Another said: 'O you who, when his name is mentioned in a gathering... The conversation becomes sweet by it and the gathering pleasant. Indeed, regarding whom I look at I am jealous, and indeed I... Am more miserly with you from other than me among mankind.' Among them are those who are jealous over him from his union with him, fearing it might be a key for others, as Ali bin Abdullah al-Ja'bari said: 'Perhaps your intentional turning away pleased me... And your dismissal and forbidding yourself from me. Caution lest I be a key for another... So if I am alone, you were the wish.' Another said: 'And when she threw a glance at another I thought her... Just as she affected with the eye, she affects the heart. And I hope she persists in her distance... But bad thoughts are from the intensity of love.' Ibn Matruh exaggerated where he says: 'If he insisted on my destruction... I would say: My torturer, by Allah, increase me! And do not permit your union for me, for I... Am jealous over you from you, so how about from me?' Among them are those who refrain from mentioning their beloved fearing exposing him to the love of others for him, as Ali bin al-Rafi'i said: 'I am not one day describing a beloved... Exposing him to the desires of men. Why should I make another's heart yearn... While between his union is the curtain of the chambers?' Many ignorant people described their wife and her beauties to others, so that was the cause of her separation and connection to the one described to; that is from his lack of intellect and his stupidity. I have seen a group with this description. Among them are those who exaggerated in jealousy until they killed their beloved fearing that they might die and others would enjoy their beloved after them, as mentioned about a group including Dik al-Jinn al-Homsi. I devoted a separate treatise to his story and named it 'Qar' Sinn Dik al-Jinn' (The Knocking of the Tooth of Dik al-Jinn/Regret). I wrote it to our Master Sultan Al-Nasir Hasan in the year seven hundred and sixty while he was in Siryaqus. I entered upon morning while what necessitated that had preceded. Therefore, I opened the mentioned treatise with my saying: He kisses the ground and informs that the mentioned Dik al-Jinn, among his madness, was that he loved a slave girl and a boy of his. Due to the intensity of his love for them and his jealousy over them, he feared that he would die and someone else would enjoy them after him. So he turned to them and slaughtered them with his sword, burned their bodies, and made from the girl's ashes a jar for wine and from the boy's ashes another jar likewise. He used to place them in his gathering of intimacy on his right and left. Whenever he longed for the girl, he kissed the jar made from her ashes, filled his cup from it, and recited: 'O face upon which death rose... And gathered the fruits of destruction for it with its hands. I quenched the dust with her blood, and long did... Passion quench my lips from her lips. And I roamed my sword in the field of her neck... While my tears flow upon her cheeks. So by the right of her sandals, and nothing trod the soil... Dearer to me than her sandals. Her killing was not because I did not... Weep if dust fell upon her. But she was stingy with her beauty to other than me... And disdained the looking of eyes at her.' And if he longed for the boy, he kissed the jar made from his ashes, filled his cup from it, wept, and recited his saying regarding him: 'I feared that Time would return with its treachery... Or I would be afflicted after union with his abandonment. A moon I extracted from his darkness... For my calamity, and stirred him from his chamber. So I killed him, and he has a dignity upon me... So mine are the vitals and his is the heart entirely. My pledge with him dead is like the best sleeper... While the eye sheds my tear on his throat. If the dead knew what is after him... With the living regarding him, he would weep for him in his grave. Choking griefs from which his soul almost overflows... And his heart almost exits his chest.' I say: This is what is said about it: Madness has arts. So to Allah we belong and to Him we return from the deed of this madman. Despite that, he is one of the softest people in poetry and most mentioning of the beloved. Of his poetry and elegant verse is his saying in supplicating against the beloved: 'How is the supplication against one who betrayed or wronged... While my owner is unjust in all he judged? May Allah not punish the one I desire for his harshness... To me, nor exact retribution for me from him, nor take revenge.' I say: The seeker became sought, and this is inverted jurisprudence. What guaranteed it is that he did to the loved ones what dogs do not do, so that he does not say 'May Allah not punish the one I desire for his harshness' and mix the softness of his poetry with his cruelty. He is in lightness and recklessness and killing the beloved, not in 'Aysh' (life) nor upon 'Aysh'. For he whom his desire overcame as you see, so he did to his beloved what he did and substituted his striking with the sword for kissing:",

    "text": "'His loved ones, why do you do to his heart... What his enemies do not do to him?' This treatise was affirmed in full in the First Chapter of my book 'Mir'at al-Uqul'. Falling into the line of this story is what Sheikh Athir al-Din Abu Hayyan narrated in his Tafsir at His saying Almighty: \"Joseph, ignore this. And [O woman], ask forgiveness for your sin.\" He reported about Al-Aziz that he had little jealousy, and the soil of the region of Egypt necessitated this, meaning lack of jealousy. Then he said: And where is this from what happened to some kings of our lands? He was with his boon companions specified to him in his gathering of intimacy, and his slave girl was singing from behind the curtain. Some of his seated companions asked the slave girl to repeat two verses, and she had sung them. Not long after, the head of the slave girl was brought cut off in a basin, and the King said to him: 'Listen to this head.' That man who asked for the repetition fell down and was ill for the duration of that King's life. I said: If he had died, he would have been excused. There is no power nor strength except in Allah the Most High, the Great. Similar to this is also what Ja'far bin Sulayman did. That is, when he bought his slave girl Al-Zarqa', and she was a slave girl of high price, for eighty thousand dirhams, and she was of the beautiful young women with melodies. He said to her one day: 'Did anyone who loved you succeed in getting seclusion or a kiss from you?' She feared that something she had done in the presence of a group might reach him or had reached him. So she said: 'No, by Allah, except Yazid bin Awn al-Abbadi kissed me and paid for a pearl he sent thirty thousand dirhams.' Ja'far did not cease seeking him and plotting for him until he fell into his hands (literally: blood money), so he beat him with whips until he died. I said: He rested, by Allah, from all this headache. Abd al-Muhsin al-Suri recited where he said regarding lack of jealousy over his beloved: 'I became attached to him drunk from the wine of youth... Having heedlessness of my anguish and wailing. And every noble person shared with me in his love... Sharing with me in my soul a portion. So do not bind me to a jealousy I am not accustomed to... For my beloved is whoever my beloved loves.' The other reached (a limit) where he said boasting of pimping: 'I pimp, praise be to Allah, not out of hatred... While others are pimps against their will.' How excellent is the saying of Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar: 'I said when the cupbearer poured... The wine on the ground. Out of jealousy from me over it... Would that I were dust.' Nur al-Din al-Ash'ari said, and excelled as he wished: 'The wind inclines the branches gently... Just as liquor inclined its drinker. It gathers between them after distance... And the leaves of the branches are a wrapper for them. They flutter in jealousy at meeting... So have you seen a pimp who is jealous?' Chapter Seven: Divulging the Secret and Concealment when Impossible. I say: We established this chapter to mention divulging the secret and its opposite, and the jest of each and its seriousness. For lovers have two schools in them. Among them are those who permitted its permissibility and saw their comfort in divulging it. And among them are those who saw its concealment as part of religion, so they settled in the ranks of love in the dearest place, where he said: ... Majnun of Amir divulged his desire... And I concealed desire so I died of my passion. So when on the Day of Resurrection it is called... Who is the victim of desire? I step forward alone. Yes, among people are those who concealed it, so his concealment showed him its non-existence. And among them are those who divulged it, so they fell into what they feared. For each of the two schools there is a witness and a sea of increasing tears whose drowned one is not saved nor is his path treaded. The lover of them is between two diseases, both dangerous, and two swords; he must be killed by one of them according to the correct famous (opinion), as Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawardi said: 'And mercy for the lovers! They bore... The secret of love, while desire exposes. In the secret, if they divulge, their blood is shed... And likewise, the blood of lovers is shed. And if they conceal, talking about them... With the slanderers is the shedding tear.' What I see regarding that - for him is discernment and simpler than dew - is that the lover, if he knows from his beloved loyalty and lack of aversion, then it is obligatory upon him to divulge the secret to the beloved and show the illness to the doctor, as was said: 'And reveal secrets to his people... And beware of revealing to others.' Abu Ja'far al-Shatranji triumphed where he said: 'Say to whom you wish that I am fond of you... Then leave him for Iblis to tame.' Some who practiced love and attracted its clever ones said: The lover divulging his secret to the beloved and complaining of what he endures is a type of magic. I said: Rather it is magic, the bulk and majority of it, and he knows that who tried it and whom love disciplined and refined.",

    "text": "Regarding this is the story of Ahmad bin Wasil. He said: When Abassa daughter of Al-Mahdi fell in love with Ja'far after Al-Rashid married him to her and conditioned on him not to approach her, her passion for him and love for him intensified. He did not comply with what she loved and feared for himself from Al-Rashid lest her matter appear. So she wrote to him: 'I resolved upon my heart to conceal desire... So it shouted and called out: Indeed I am not doing (so). If you do not contact me, I will divulge the secret by force... Even if my blamers embraced me in your love. Even if it is death, I will not die with my choking grief... And I admitted before death that you are my killer.' So she attained from him what she wanted. Did she obtain that except by divulging her secret and complaining of her harm? Ibn Shadhan the scribe said: 'Arib, the slave girl of Al-Ma'mun, said to me: I was with Al-Wathiq while he was touring the chambers of his slave girls when he went out to Al-Anbar for recreation. He entered upon Farida his slave girl, and he loved her very much. He also loved a maid of hers, but no one knew that other than me. When she saw him with her mistress, she entered her closet and stood at her head, wearing a headband on which these two verses were written in gold: \"My eyes weep fearing separation... How hot is separation to the eye. I have not seen in love and its anguishes... More painful than the separation of the two friends (Ilfayn).\" Al-Wathiq said to me: \"Did you understand, O Arib?\" I said: \"Yes, my master.\" So he wrote on the ground with a stick in his hand: \"Desire appeared and its curtains were torn... And the best path of love is its declaring. So disobey the blamers in your desire publicly... For the sweetest life of the wandering admirer is its publicity.\" She memorized the verses and they laughed together. Farida realized, so she said: \"O my master, I knew what you two are in, so favor your maid by accepting her.\" Al-Wathiq said: \"I have done so; take her to you, O Arib.\" So I took her hand, and he could not control himself until he left quickly from behind me, and was alone with her and ordered a thousand dinars for me.' Among them are those who do not run the mention of love on their tongue at all, and keep silent as if they had a silence disease. I have not seen regarding that, among what competitors compete in, better than the saying of Ibn Qalaqis: 'I concealed desire from the blamers, being protective... Of them regarding whom I yearn for and love. If I said I am a lover, they would roam with it... For their knowledge that none is loved but him.' Among them are those who bear his sin... And see declaring his name. 'So declare the name of whom you desire and leave me from nicknames... For there is no good in pleasures with a curtain before them.' Ibrahim bin Abdullah said: 'I saw on the cheek of a slave girl... Written with civet (Ghaliya) every day: I melt from the pain of longing... And my heart from aversion is ulcerated. I did not find seclusion with you to complain... What is in my heart, perhaps it would rest. Woe to my heart, as if it is the niche of a grave... That enclosed the limbs of a dead person with a soul.' In the second verse of these verses is a reminder that divulging the secret to the beloved can only be in seclusion. So no friend nor companion should know of it as long as he finds a way to that, as was said: 'O you who kindled the fire flaming on my liver... To you I complain of what afflicts me, not to anyone. To you I complain of what afflicts me of your love, for I... Sought other than you for the complaint but did not find.' Al-Ahwas said: 'By your life, I did not entrust my secret and her secret... To other than us, cautious lest the secrets be lost.' Of the witty things that passed me in this chapter is that some lover recited one day to his beloved the saying of the poet: 'My secret and your secret, no one felt it... Except the God, and you, then me.' She said to him: 'Do not forget the pimp, for she must know our secret and look into our matter.' Of the best I heard in dispraising the divulger of the secret is the saying of Al-Husayn bin Bishr: 'May Allah curse a man you entrusted a secret... To conceal it, and may Allah break his mouth. For he, with what you filled him of it... Is more leaking than glass regarding what it contained.' I said: It is not unlikely that one characterized by this attribute is of the offspring of the one who said: 'I do not conceal secrets but I gossip them... Nor do I leave secrets boiling on my heart. For of little intellect is he who spends his night... Secrets turning him side to side.' Where is this from the saying of the one who said: 'A sayer said: Why is your body not seen... Sick, while the bodies of lovers sicken? I said to her: My heart did not reveal your love... To my body, so my body does not know of the desire.' It is told that Sukayna bint al-Husayn bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them, passed in her slave girls by Urwa bin Udhayna while he was singing. She said to her slave girls: 'Who is the Sheikh?' They said: 'Urwa.' So she turned towards him. She said: 'O Abu Tammam, you claim that you never loved? How, when you say: She said: And I spread my secret to her so I revealed it.'",

    "text": "'And you were, with me, loving the veil, so veil yourself. The veil (is) seeing who is around me.' I said to her: 'Your love covered what I meet from my sight.' She said: 'All you see around me of the slave girls are free if this speech ever came out of a sound heart.' It is told about Ahmad bin Abi Uthman the Scribe that he was a friend of Abu al-Fadl Abd al-Ghaffar al-Ansari. Ahmad loved a slave girl of Umm Ja'far named Nu'm and wandered in love with her. He informed him (Abd al-Ghaffar) of his secret and described her to him. So Abd al-Ghaffar al-Ansari loved her and fell ill with a long illness. His news reached Umm Ja'far, and she thought he had a (physical) illness, so she sent a doctor to him. He recited: 'Umm Ja'far sent a doctor to me... To treat me, excess of knowledge of the doctor. While my medicine and the origin of my disease are with her... In the hand of a deceived, nurtured fawn. Inform her that Nu'm is my medicine... To treat her patient soon.' Umm Ja'far heard the verses and asked about his story. When she understood it, she gifted him the slave girl. Ahmad abandoned Abd al-Ghaffar and said: 'I made you a place for my secret, so you spoiled (it) for me.' The corruptions resulting from divulging the secret to others are many. For this reason, Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri said: 'Think evil of all brothers... And do not trust a heart with a secret.' Sahib Muhyi al-Din al-Jazari said in a letter: 'Oh wonder! How does he whom I do not name not realize, and not split (from grief) due to the abundance of my hovering around speech regarding him without fulfilling it? If I explained, souls would overflow, let alone eyes, and thoughts would throw themselves into the abysses of sin. If I showed some of it, I fear people would realize, and if I poured forth in it, I fear paper would not contain it.' Among the best I heard in concealing the secret is the saying of Al-Nabigha. Imam Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, used to quote it as a proverb: 'Do not divulge your secret, not (even) to you... For every adviser has an adviser. For I have seen the slanderers of men... Not leaving a hide intact.' Abd al-Malik bin Marwan wrote them to Al-Hajjaj, having asked him to keep a matter secret in a letter he wrote to him, but it appeared. Amr bin Al-Aas said: 'I never entrusted anyone with a secret and he divulged it, and I blamed him, because I was narrower of chest with it than him when I entrusted it.' The poet took it and said: '... If the chest of a man narrows from his own secret, then the chest of the one entrusted with the secret is narrower.' Another said: 'If you do not guard its secret for yourself... Then your secret among people is more spread and lost.' Abu Ja'far al-Shatranji said: 'Do not inform of your secret, but kill it... And make from your vitals a veil for it. I have never entrusted a secret like the soul... Nor closed a door like the chest.' Al-Mawardi narrated that Abdullah bin Tahir discussed keeping secrets in his gathering. He said: 'And one entrusting me with a secret, I guaranteed its covering... So I deposited it from the resting place of the vitals into a grave.' His son Abdullah, who was a boy, said and excelled as he wished: 'The secret in my heart is not like possessors of a grave... Because I see the buried waiting for the Resurrection. But I hide it until it is as if I... Never encompassed any knowledge of it from time.' Another said: 'O you who entrusted me with his secret... Do not hope to hear it from me. I did not run it later in my mind... As if it never passed my ear.' Bashar said: 'I will surely leave the world while your love... Is between the ribs; no one knew of it.' Talha bin Abi Bakr said: 'Do not show love for a beloved... Or you will see with your eyes every wonder from him. I showed my affection to a beloved one day... So I took a share of his abandonment.' It was said a man confided a speech to a man. When he finished, he said: 'Did you memorize?' He said: 'Rather, I forgot.' Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: 'Whenever the treasurers of secrets increase, its loss increases.' From the words of the wise: 'Guard your gold (Dhahab) just as you conceal your school of thought (Madhhab).' And: 'A man's killing place is between his jaws.' From the words of Judge Al-Fadil: 'Kill secrets in your heart and bury their dead in your side. For it is ugly for you that a secret is seen of you except by your Lord.' A Bedouin described a people saying: 'Their swords are the banes of lives, and their chests are the graves of secrets.' How excellent is the saying of Ibn Mamati from verses: 'The prison narrowed on me until it was as if I... Settled in it for narrowness in the chest of a resentful one. Oh would that I were like the tear in the eyelid of a lover... So I exit, or like the secret in the chest of a fool.' Al-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf said: 'My tear divulged, so it does not conceal a secret... And I found the tongue possessing concealment. I was like the book, its folding hid it... So they found indication of it by the address.'

    "text": "I say: We established this chapter to mention tricking the beloved regarding himself, and joining his day with his yesterday. It is one of the greatest chapters in content, most numerous in bribery, best in invention, most in deception, most eloquent in gathering firewood (rhetoric), and most in hitting the mark. We will present of that what is sweet to present and good to recite for the people of composition, so they know that the writer tricks the beloved and races with the delicacy of his words the crimson wine. Of that, and it is among the best I heard in tricking the beloved: 'Rise with us, O light of my eye... Let us make doubt certainty. ... Until when, O my beloved... Will the killer sin regarding us?' Similar is the saying of the other: 'I do not forget, I do not forget her saying at Mina... Woe to you, the slanderers have worked. And a slanderer gossiped about us, so I said to her... Do you have (interest), O Hind, in what they claimed? She said: For what do you see? I said to her... So that the thoughts and accusations are not wasted.' Al-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf said: 'As if there was no desire between me and you... And my rope was not connected to your rope. And I am ashamed for you of a narrator... Narrating about you boredom and procrastination.' Another said: 'I was attributed to a sin while I was not a sinner... And you burdened me in love with what I cannot bear. And my seeking of union is not greed for survival... But it is a reward I drive to you.' I said: 'He is not satisfied to go equal for equal... Until I drive the reward to him also.' Among what I said in this meaning: 'I did not request union for my sake, may I be your ransom, O... One who increased my luck in blackness with moles. But I feared that you be afflicted with the love of a fawn... Who exacts retribution for me from you, and the world is requital.' Another said: 'People have increased types of talk about us... And people separated their sayings about us, a separation. So a liar threw suspicion on other than you... And a truthful one does not know that he spoke truth.' Another said: 'O my master, you have a wrong against me... So ask Ibn Abi Khaythama for a fatwa regarding it. For he narrates it from his grandfather... And his grandfather narrates it from Ikrimah. From Ibn Abbas, from the Chosen One... Our Prophet sent with mercy. That the cutting off of a friend from his friend... Above three (days), our Lord forbade it. And you have been abandoning us for a month... Do you not fear Allah regarding us? So stop!' Jamil said: 'And what might the slanderers say... Other than to say that I am a lover ('Ashiq) of you? Yes, the slanderers spoke truth, you are beloved... To me, even if the traits were not described of you.' I said: This is how I saw it in most of the copies of Al-Hamasa I stood upon and heard from the mouths of the people of literature, meaning the rhyme of the first verse is 'Ashiq'. The correct is that it is 'Wamiq', because the meaning according to that is its explanation is that the 'Wamiq' is the lover without suspicion, and the 'Ashiq' is the lover with suspicion. Since that is so, the trickery is not valid except by his saying 'And what might the slanderers say other than that I am a Wamiq of you', meaning a lover without suspicion. Ibn Rawaha al-Hamawi said: 'If my killing is sweet to you... Then increase the abandonment in my torture. Perhaps the standing between me... And you before Allah in the Reckoning will be prolonged.' It is told that some recited to a youth he loved: 'What will you say when we meet tomorrow... And I say to the Merciful: This is my killer?' And I say to the Merciful: This is my killed. The youth said to him: 'I say this wanted to... so I enabled him.' Ibn Sana' al-Mulk said: From a letter: 'And I, by Allah, am overcome in your matter. The reason is that I am the lover (Muhibb) and you are the beloved (Mahbub). I do not strive against you, deceiving you and betraying your love, nor do I affect against you, cheating you and grieving your heart. Do what you wish, for I am the patient, and kill how you wish, for I am the thankful. Say to me, for I have a hearing that loves your speech, and turn, you will see my hopes fluttering around you. So do, for you are the excused, and lengthen (the arrogance), for I am not the harmed but the pleased. And return to the affection that is between us, for every sin of yours is forgiven.' He also said: 'And I seek refuge in Allah from a sin that necessitates your blame, hints at your punishment, turns your heart away, makes you bend your side (in arrogance), and changes you against your slave: I am not strong in endurance of your abandonment... Nor fully armed against your blame.' Ibn al-Sawadi, the famous poet, said: 'I complain to you, and of your aversion I complain... And I think due to my fondness that you are fair to me. And I turn away from you fearing lest be seen... Aversion from you, so he who gloats gloats.' Judge Abu Amr Muhammad bin Yusuf al-Azdi narrated saying: I was walking with Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Dawud al-Isfahani in Baghdad, and behold a slave girl singing from poetry:",

    "text": "'I complain to you of a heart you are its destroyer... The complaint of a sick one to an intimate tending him. An illness whose abundance increases with days... And you, in the greatness of what I encounter, belittle it. Allah forbade my killing in love foolishly... And you, O my killer, unjustly make it lawful.' Muhammad bin Dawud said: 'What is the way to retrieve this?' I said to him: 'Far from it! The riders have traveled with it.' Abu Abdullah said: 'My heart is softer for you than your cheeks... And my powers are weaker than the powers of your eyelids. Why do you not have mercy on one whose heart you torture... Unjustly, while his desire inclines him towards you?' Nasir al-Din bin al-Naqib said: 'Zakat has become obligatory upon your beauty... And in it, like what is in wealth, is a right. So do not deviate with it from me, for I am... Its poor deserving recipient.' Judge Shams al-Din bin Khallikan, may Allah have mercy on him, said from a poem: 'Were I not in a rank for which I observe... The old covenant preserving the position. I would have torn my veil in your love, and to my humiliation... Cast off restraint, and my blamer would have persisted regarding you. But I feared that my blamers would say: This Sheikh has gone mad for this boy.' Another said: 'My arguments against you when you are alone are many... And when you are present, I am defeated. I cannot say you wronged me... Allah knows that I am wronged.' Al-Mukarram said: 'People have sinned regarding us by their suspicion... And believed what I know and you know. What harms you in confirming their suspicion... By us realizing what they say about us? My bearing and your bearing of a single sin, trusting... In forgiveness, is more beautiful than the sin of mankind regarding us.' Al-Mutanabbi said: 'Supply us from the beauty of your face as long as it lasts... For the beauty of faces is a changing state. And connect us with your union now in the world... For the stay in it is little.' I say: This last verse is good in its chapter regarding tricking the beloved and appeasing him. As for the first, it contains alienation. Would that he rested and relieved and left mocking beautiful faces. However, Al-Tala'fari imitated him in mocking his loved ones. Possessor of a verse said: 'O leaver of the quarter of patience in me destroyed... There is no coming seen for an absent union. Describe your Lord to the lovers and be gentle with them... And do not think that the state of beauty lasts.' Chapter Nine: Messengers and Letters, and Gentleness in Means. I say: We established this chapter to mention correspondence with loved ones and complaining of ardency in the reply. It is a trodden path, a selling market. Often the lover presented the commodity of emaciation to the messenger in it. Especially one whose patience failed and whose matter became famous, so he became thrown in the house, and used even the wind in corresponding with the beloved, as was said: 'O breeze of the East, you are the messenger to him... And Allah knows that I am jealous of you. Convey my greeting to one whom I do not speak to... That I am angry at that angry one. No, O messenger, do not mention my anger to him... For that is from me camouflage and falsehood. And how can I be angry? No, by Allah, no anger... Indeed, I am rejoicing at what he intended of my killing. Is there every day for us messengers going back and forth... And every day for us types of blame? I use the wind to carry peace to you... As if I am in the time of Solomon.' He is halved by desire and on a journey from establishing abandonment. No stability settles for him, and he does not warm himself by the fire of his beloved's cheek. No wonder he distracts himself with the gentle breeze and says regarding inhaling a little of it: 'Your little cannot be called little.' Among the best I heard in this chapter is the saying of Al-Wawa al-Dimashqi: 'By Allah, your Lord, turn to my dweller... And blame him, perhaps blame bends him. And speak to him and say in your speech... What is the matter with your slave, with abandonment you destroy him? If he smiles, say in kindness... What harm if you aid him with a union from you? And if anger appears to you in his face... Then deceive and say: We do not know him.' He took it from the saying of Umar bin Abi Rabi'a from verses describing his pimp: 'So a knowledgeable doctor came to her... Mixing seriousness repeatedly with play. She roughens speech if she softens to her... And slackens at the fits of anger.' It is said that Ibn Atiq said to Umar when he heard this saying of his: 'How much the Muslims need a Caliph to manage their affair like this pimp of yours.' Similar to Al-Wawa's saying is the saying of the other: 'lo, O breeze of the wind, convey my message... To Sulayma and compensate with me as if you are joking.",

    "text": "'And if she turns away from me, then camouflage deceivingly... With another, and say: The wailing women wailed over him.' And the saying of the other, a Dubayt: 'With kindness, if you meet the one I desire... Blame him and tell him what I encounter. If union angers him, deceive him with it... Or if he softens, say: Your slave, do not forget him.' Abu Firas said: 'A northern wind blew on us... Linked to the heart by causes. It performed messages of love between us... I knew it from among my companions.' Al-Sahib bin Abbad, may Allah have mercy on him, used to sway when he heard these two verses. I have dedicated a separate chapter to the Breeze in my book 'Suluk al-Sunan fi Wasf al-Sakan' and mentioned in it things fitting for this chapter. Among them is the saying of Amin al-Din Ibn Ataya: 'I desire the branch of the dune (Naqa) and these... While my heart in his love is in the wilderness. O breeze of the East, be gentle with him... And be kind to him and do not harm him. And carry a message; there is none but... You, a trustee in carrying it whom I approve. And if a breeze is not my messenger... Towards the branch of the dune, who will bend him?' Ibn al-Khayyat al-Dimashqi said: 'O breeze of the East fond of my passion... How excellent you would be if you passed by Hind. And your scent made me doubt, so by Allah when... Was its covenant with the ruins of Najd?' Mahyar al-Daylami said: 'Load the breeze of the East with your scent... Before it carries wormwood and lavender. And send me your phantom in the darkness... If you permit my eyelids to sleep.' It is told that Nur al-Din Ali bin Sa'id al-Maghribi, author of 'Al-Murqis wal-Mutrib', passed with a group of Egyptian literati, among them Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar. They passed in their way by a handsome youth sleeping under a tree, and the wind blew and uncovered his clothes from him. Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar said: 'Stop, so each of us may compose something on this.' He said: Not long after, Nur al-Din mentioned said: 'The wind is the greatest pimp because it... Reveals the secrets of the buttocks and the folds of the belly. And it sways the branches when it blows... Until the faces of the streams kiss. Therefore, lovers take it... As messengers to loved ones and homelands.' Abu al-Husayn al-Jazzar said: 'None of us remains who can come up with the like of this, so let us go.' Ali al-Saffar said: 'If a breeze blew with good scent... I rejoiced and said: Welcome, O Messenger. Except that I am jealous because in it... Is your scent and it is sick like me.' Judge Muhyi al-Din bin Abd al-Zahir used to love a young singer named Nasim (Breeze) and has several stanzas about him, including his saying: 'If lovers, out of their longings... Made the breeze a messenger to the beloved. Then I am the one who recites to them: Would that I... Had taken a path with the messenger.' I said, as if present addressing him implying (quotation): 'If you are in the love of Nasim (Breeze/Name) enslaved... And claimed that his desire (air) is not destructive. Then I say to one who provoked love... You exposed yourself to wear, so be a target.' Judge Muhyi al-Din also said regarding his beloved Nasim: 'O you who became to me from the storms... Of abandonment, the barren wind. Do you think he treats my love... And it is said: The Nasim (Breeze/Patient) has softened?' I said as if present addressing him: 'By Allah, if the Nasim softened and subsided... A fire kindled by the hand of torment. Transfer your heart wherever you wish from desire... And leave the blamer and his saying in the wind.' Judge Muhyi al-Din also said: 'Thanks to the breeze of your land... How much greeting it conveyed from me. And to you it prolonged, rather made pleasant... In its intelligent messages. No wonder if it memorized the... Hadiths of Love, for it is intelligent (Dhakiyyah - also implies fragrant).' Salah al-Din Khalil bin Aybak al-Safadi from the people of the age took it and said: 'O good scent that blew to me from your land... So it stirred the hidden of my anguish and my exposure. It gifted your greeting and resembled your kindness... And narrated your scent; indeed this is an intelligent (Dhakiy) wind.' I said when I stood upon this saying of his and the saying of Judge Muhyi al-Din preceding him: 'Indeed the son of Aybak, his thefts ceased not... To come with every ugly and ugly thing. He attributed meanings in the breeze to himself... Ignorantly, so his speech went in the wind.'",

    "text": "I have mentioned regarding the Breeze pleasant things in my book 'Suluk al-Sunan' mentioned, and restricted myself from them to this amount here fearing elongation. The messenger must be of the people of maintenance (of dignity) and of those who refer to religion, lest he covets and becomes an intimate friend after being a messenger, as happened to the messenger of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk, regarding whom he said: 'He went as a messenger and came back to me a lover... And an obstacle hindered him from my message. And he returned to me not with the answer, but with ardency... That silenced him while passion speaks through him.' Another said: 'The messenger returned to me while he was enslaved.' For this reason, Ibn al-Athir said: 'There is no trust over Beauty, and in its like treachery is excused.' Al-Mutanabbi said: 'What is the matter with us, all of us are Jawwa (Yamamah), O messenger... I love and your heart is the sick one. And whenever he returned from the one I sent to... He was jealous of me and betrayed in what he says. Her eyes corrupted the trusts between us... And hearts betrayed minds.' He rests (meaning): Her eyes by their magic corrupted the trust of the messenger in the message, and hearts betrayed minds, meaning minds separated from hearts because of her. Al-Arjani said: 'An oath, the breeze indeed returned sick... When it traveled from me to you as a messenger. And it knew by your love that it had betrayed me... So it became dragging the tails of life (in shame).' Among the best I heard regarding Letters and Gentleness in Means is what is told about Al-Malik Al-Aziz son of Sultan Salah al-Din. He loved a songstress in the days of his father and was fond of her. Salah al-Din heard (of it), so he forbade him from her company and forbade her from him. He grieved and was unable to meet with her. A period of days passed on that. Then she sent him with a servant a ball of ambergris. He broke it and found in it a button of gold. He did not understand her intent by that. Judge Al-Fadil came to him and he informed him of the shape. He said immediately: 'She gifted you ambergris, in its center... A button of raw gold, thin of welding. So the button (Zirr) from the ambergris (Anbar), its interpretation is... Visit (Zur) like this, hidden in the dark.' Ala' al-Din al-Maghribi said from the 'Letter of the Two Luminaries', which is from the depressed lover to the beloved of the beloved, opening it with his saying: 'He kisses the ground and informs before the Merciful King, the Sultan of Beauties and the Lion of Struggle,' from it: 'The Nile went and returned... And my love continues. Whenever I said tomorrow will... Decrease some of the passion, it increased. Every heart other than my heart... Attained the desire in love. And I, the poor one, alone... Attained stubbornness in companionship.' The narrator said: Then Ala' al-Din said: 'And I, the poor one, alone urinated in the plate of Qata'if (pancakes) and made the vinegar Nataf (sweet). I whistled to Iblis with his accuracy and left him lowering and clapping and singing \"Tallalah\": O little eyes of the gazelle. May Allah have mercy on who killed me... And what pride is there in killing the like of me? Am I but a little poet, a silly laughingstock, who made his letters his means and his poems his traps? He milks the udder of humility and removes the mask of contentment. If he hungers, he eats from the scansion of meters, and if he thirsts, he drinks from the seas of poetry, in a time where there is no difference among its people between the slanderer and the praiser, and the shouter and the wailer: I tasted from him what... Abu al-Husayn al-Qalla' (the tooth-puller) does not pull from my molar. Rather, what thing is more beautiful than two luxurious fawns, two intimates, suckling the breast of companionship, sipping the cup of love, picking the fruit of union, greeting each other with types of coquetry, describing to each other the burning of desire, and spreading out the spreading of pigeons? Nothing attends them but joking and joy, and nothing kisses them but the cup of wine: Two like one from the length of their embrace, spending the night in a praiseworthy night not dispraised, revealing two luminaries and smiling about two pearls (rows of teeth), and stealing looks with the glances of two wild calves. As if they divided the arts of beauty and benevolence with the two pans of the balance. If they exchange admonition or correspond with a letter, it is scattered decree and magic not forbidden. And if they race in the field of desire or pelt each other with the arrows of ardency, the avenger is avenged and the magician is enchanted.' It is a witty, elegant letter, all of it of this type. I restricted myself from it to this amount (fearing) elongation. I mentioned it in full in the second part of 'Hatib Layl'. I said, from what I wrote to some friends: 'I wrote to you while the lines, their letters... Have eyes gazing at you and glancing. And I have a pen, for whose moist tongue... Is the greeting of a yearning one whom yearning has emaciated.' Chapter 10: Tricks on the Phantom of Imagination and other things said about it with differing meanings.",

    "text": "I say: We established this chapter to mention the visiting Phantom of Imagination (Tayf al-Khayal) and what has been said about its travel in current proverbs. For poets have tricks and subtle beauty in hunting it. Often they increased its mention and extracted it from its nest, so they brought close upon it the distance of the journey and did not loathe appending its augury to physiognomy. Among those famous for excellence in it is Abu Ubadah (Al-Buhturi) and others like Ibn al-Naqib, the tricker in hunting the phantom of the beloved: Where he said and spoke well: 'I set up my eyelids as traps for the phantom... Perhaps a phantom from him presents itself in slumber. And how, if I close them, can I hunt him... While traps are customarily opened for hunting?' How excellent is the saying of Sheikh Jamal al-Din Ibn Nubata in Tawriya (double entendre): 'And one fond of traps... He extends them and nets. The eye said to me: What... Does he hunt? I said: Your slumber (Karak - also implies sandgrouse).' I also said: 'And I swear if the phantom granted a visit... It would encounter the door of the eyelid locked by opening (Fath).' Abu Muhammad Abdullah al-Saruji said and excelled as he wished: 'Grant your union, for this is its time... Sufficient is what I have tasted of abandonment. I spent my life in your love, and would that I... Was given a union for what I spent. O you with whose love I was occupied from others... And I forgot all people when I loved you. You are the one whose face gathered beauties... But upon it I dispersed my patience. How many a knight roamed in the field of your love... With patience from me in your desire I preceded him. The slanderers said he claimed a relation to you... So I was pleased when I said: You believed him. By Allah, if they ask you about me, say to them... My slave and the property of my hand, and I did not free him. Or if it is said: He is longing for you, say to them... I know that, and I am the one who made him long. O beauty of a phantom from your imagination that visited me... From my joy at meeting him, I did not verify him. So he passed, and in my heart is a regret over him... If sleep were possible for me, I would have caught him.' Abu Tammam said: 'The phantom visited for her, no, rather a thought visited for him... If the thought of people slept, he did not sleep. A fawn I hunted when I set up for him... From the end of the night traps from the dream.' He also said: 'O what a pleasure spirits enjoyed... In it secretly from bodies, a gathering. We had no fault in it... Except that we were in the call of dreams.' Al-Buhturi said: And he is among those who did much in describing the phantom, excelling in it. Due to his fondness for it and fame, he became a proverb. So it was said 'The Phantom of Al-Buhturi'. Of that is his saying: 'Whenever slumber gifted her phantom to me... Its nearness cured the agony or quenched the thirst. If an awakening snatched it from my hand... I thought a beloved went from me or ran. I have not seen the like of us nor the like of our affair... We are tortured awake and blessed asleep.' And his saying: 'And I did not forget the aid of slumber by her nearness... And her visit after the quiet, while she did not know. If the night gave us a language of union... The early signs of morning turned us to abandonment.' And his saying also: 'She sent her phantom to me while between me... Is a march of two months for strong camels. They visited here from Al-Sham, so he greeted... A wandering lover in the land of Iraq. So he judged what he judged and returned to her... While the darkness was in the patched garment of worn out (clothes).' And his saying: 'And a night we nodded (in sleep) regarding life, she sent... A phantom of imagination whose falsehood resembles the truth. Were it not for the whiteness of morning, my clinging would have been long... To the sides of a gazelle I spent the night flirting with.' How many a hand of the night is praiseworthy to me... And to the morning is a matter whose consequences are dispraised.' Abd al-Samad bin al-Mu'adhdhal said: 'Sleep connected between us after abandonment... So we met while we were separated. Except that spirits feared a watcher... So they folded their secret from bodies. A view that was the pleasure of the heart except... That it was a view without visual witnessing.' Al-Murtada said these verses are narrated for Al-Humayduni and they are many of his like. Ibn al-Qattan the Baghdadi poet entered one day upon the Vizier Al-Zayni while Al-Hays Bays was with him. He said: 'I have composed two verses for which a third cannot be composed because I have exhausted the meaning in them.' The Vizier said: 'And what are they?' So he recited: 'The phantom visited, stingy like its sender... So the embrace and kisses did not cure me of him. He never visited me except to agree with me... On sleep, so he banishes it and departs.'",

    "text": "The Vizier said to Al-Hays Bays: 'What do you say to his claim?' He said: 'If he repeats them, he will hear a third for them.' So he repeated them. Al-Hays Bays said: 'And he did not know that my sleep was a trick set up... Subtle, when tricks exhausted wakefulness.' Another said: 'Behold, many a phantom of yours spent the night embracing me... Until the caller of the morning called: Come to prayer.' The first to describe the phantom was Amr bin Qami'ah as narrated by Al-Murtada in the book 'Al-Tayf wal-Khayal', saying: 'Umamah distanced herself except for a question... And except for a phantom meeting a phantom. A phantom imagining to me attaining her... And if I were able, I would not imagine attainment.' The first to drive away the phantom was Tarafa bin al-Abd where he said: 'So say to the phantom of the Hanzaliyyah, let him return... To her, for I connect the ropes of the one who connects.' Jarir followed him and said: 'The huntress of the heart knocked (at night), and this is not the time of the visit, so return in peace.' Stranger than Jarir in driving away the phantom is Al-Ra'i where he satirized him saying: 'The phantom circled my companions, so I said to them... Is that Laila who came by night or the Ghoul?' Our Master the Chief Judge Taj al-Din al-Subki refuted Jarir and excelled as he wished where he said: 'I wish I knew, did Jarir love... When he showed his excuse? If his love was true... Then his heart is like stones. Nay, harder in cruelty... So look at him showing his shame. When he said a saying not said by... A lover of affection and boldness: \"The huntress of the heart knocked... And (this is) not the visit.\"' He also said refuting him: 'This speech of yours, O Jarir... Is to me the most hideous that is said. Is there a time not suitable... For the visit and union? Or was it said before you: Return... And for that is a sin not forgiven (said). Or was your love false... So his sleep negates the phantom? Or was your heart of iron... Arrows do not harm it?' I said: 'Shame on you, O Jarir... In gatherings and scenes. The huntress of the heart knocked... So you were a lover (Sabb) not a hunter (Sa'id). So you turned back the phantom of her imagination... This is a corrupt imagination from you. Is the phantom more in love than you when... He came to you while you were sleeping? The like of you has not returned as long as... A visitor for lovers remains among people.' I also said from a poem: 'My heart demands him of me, so it is as if I am... A debtor and my heart in demanding him is a creditor (Mughram - also means fond). I have of him in the night of slumber and its day... A visiting phantom or a greeting beloved.' Shams al-Din Muhammad bin al-Afif al-Tilimsani said: 'O welcome to your phantom as a comer... O best of the world in the world. A phantom whose light manifested shining... Until the eye of the sleeper saw it. O absent one who rules over my soul... Over me the absence of the ruler has prolonged. It is a shame on your beauty that... My lot complains of it that it is my oppressor.' Al-Tihami excelled in preferring the phantom over the reality where he said: 'The union of the phantom and the union of the maiden if she is stingy... Are equal; how similar is finding to non-existence! The phantom is better in union, for its pleasure... Is free of sin, disturbance, and regret.' Kushajim reached the limit in subtlety where he apologized on the tongue of the beloved for the delay of the phantom, saying: 'She was stingy even with a greeting phantom... To me, and said: Mercy for my beloved. I fear for my phantom if it comes knocking... Your pillow, that the phantom of my watcher meets it.' How excellent also is the excuse of Al-Maghribi, and Ibn 'Unayn included it and wrote with it from Yemen to his brother in Damascus: 'I forgave your letters in the estrangement, knowing... That the sheet lacked a carrier. And I excused your phantom in the harshness because... It travels by night but morning comes whilst it is stages away from us.' Another said: 'And the phantom of the one I love visited me cautiously... Of the slanderers, while the caller of the morning had shouted. I almost woke those around me with it out of joy... And the covering of love almost tore due to my fondness. Then I woke up and my hopes failed me... Obtaining the wish, so my envy turned into regret.' Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: 'I saw him in sleep apologizing... To me for what he committed while awake. And he softened until when I intended him... I found him at morning non-existent.'",

    "text": "It was said that it is of the misery of the world that a person sees in his sleep that he smelled perfume, reached a beloved, attained glory, or found a treasure, but when he wakes up he sees nothing of that. Perhaps he saw that he had wet himself, and when he wakes up he sees that surely in his clothes. As was said about it: 'I see in my sleep everything that pleases me... And my vision after sleep is more severe and uglier. If it was good, it is pipe dreams... And if it was evil, it came to me before I woke up.' Al-Ma'arri said: 'To Allah I complain that I, every night... If I slept, I did not lack thoughts of illusions. If it was evil, it is no doubt real... And if it was good, it is pipe dreams.' How excellent is the saying of Ibn al-Tilmidh: 'I blamed when your phantom did not visit in sleep... So my longing for you is robbed. So he visited me gracefully and blamed me... As it is said: Dreams are inverted.' Ibn al-Ahnaf said: 'And I dream in sleep of all good... Then I wake up not seeing it and it not seeing me. And if I saw evil in my sleep... I met evil before the Adhan.' How witty is the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz: 'The phantom visited without his praise... And replaced me with union from his repulsion. How many a sleep for me was a pimp... It brought the beloved despite his distance.' Similar is the saying of the other: '... I left satirizing Iblis then praised him... And that matter was hard for me to follow. He brings the one I desire near sometimes, and if he refuses... He imitated him as a phantom in slumber so...'. Some Sheikhs of the age said: 'If your phantom in sleep were my companion... I would not spend the night complaining of my anguish and fever. A moon who circulated upon me the wine of his saliva... And his glances and his intimate speech. My reliance in his nearness and presence... And his loyalty is only upon Iblis.' How excellent is the saying of Judge Al-Fadil, may Allah have mercy on him: 'This is because I do not count a favor for the phantom. Even if he rode the unknowns, cut the stages, stepped over branches of spears to me, waded streams of swords, trod on thorns of blades, stumbled on mountains of imagination, and approached while the eyes of stars around me were gazing and the tips of bows were near. How can I count a favor for him while the thought is civilian (nearby) and I am awake? And he represents what was not of his nearness just as eyes represented of him what was.' It is told about some simpleton that he tired himself in obtaining a woman he desired for a long time. When she was obtained at his house, he put his head down and slept. She said to him: 'Why did you do this?' He said: 'Out of my love for you I sleep, perhaps I see your phantom in sleep.' It is told about some miser that he said to his beloved: 'I put my cheek on the ground so that you may be pleased.' She said: 'Give me a dinar so I let you put your cheek on my cheek.' The saying of the poet reached the limit of kindness: 'She said to a phantom of imagination that visited me and left... By Allah, describe him and do not decrease nor increase. He said: I left him such that if he died of thirst... And I said: Stand (stop) from arriving at the water, he would not arrive (to drink). She said: You spoke the truth; loyalty in love is his habit... Oh the coolness of what she said on my liver.' And the saying of the other: 'Why did you not prevent, since you prevented her speech... A phantom coming to us from a distance, guiding?' ... 'May Allah water ruins in the courtyards of the Hima... Even if they have shown the people a condition... Dwellings, if my funeral passed by them... The echo (owl/thirst) would say: O my two companions, descend with me.' Tawba bin al-Humayri said: 'If you prevent Laila and the goodness of her speech... You will not prevent me from weeping for the rhymes. So why did you not prevent, since you prevented her speech... A phantom coming to us from a distance, guiding?' Chapter Eleven: Shortness and Length of the Night, Dyeing of its Twilight and its Fading, and what carries that meaning. I say: We established this chapter to mention one whose sleeplessness of his short eyelid became long, so he reached evening having no ambassador but the unveiling of the morning. So he recites from the intensity of burning and abundance of insomnia: 'O Night, be long or do not be long... I must keep vigil with you. If my Moon (beloved) spent the night with me... I would not spend the night tending to your stars (moon).' Lovers have never ceased complaining of the night and its length, describing it with blackness of face upon its arrival. Their excuse in that is clear. How not, when the poet said regarding it: 'The darkness died in a night... Which I revived when it darkened (As'as). If the night had a morning... That lived, it would have breathed.' Sharaf al-Din Ahmad bin Munqidh said: 'When I saw the star with a wondering eye... And the Pole had cast a drowsiness upon it. And the Daughters of Na'sh (Ursa Major) in mourning, unveiled... I became certain that their morning had died.' He also said: 'And many a night in which its star got lost... I cut it with sleeplessness, so it lengthened and darkened. And I asked it about its morning, so it answered me... Had it been in the bonds of life, it would have breathed.' I say: Before beginning to cite the stanzas of this chapter, a pleasant story relating to the length and shortness of night is mentioned here. It is what Abu Muhammad Ismail bin Mansur al-Jawaliqi narrated. He said: A youth stood over my father while he was sitting in a circle in which students were reading to him. He said: 'O my master, I heard two verses of poetry and did not understand their meaning.' He said to him: 'Say.' So he recited: 'The union of the beloved is Gardens of Eternity he inhabits... And abandonment is the Fire; he burns us with the Fire. For the sun is in Sagittarius in the evening while it is descending... If he does not visit me, and in Gemini if he visits.' He said: When my father heard them, he said to him: 'O my son, this is something of the knowledge of stars and their movement, not of the craft of the people of literature.' So the youth left without gaining benefit. My father was ashamed because he asked about something he had no knowledge of. He swore to himself not to sit in a circle until he looked into the science of stars and knew the movement of what was asked. (It means) that if the sun is in the end of Sagittarius, the night is at the extreme of length because it is the end of the autumn season. And if it is in the end of Gemini, the night is at the extreme of shortness because it is in the end of the spring season. As if he says: If he does not visit me, the night for me is extremely long, and if he visits me, the night for me is extremely short. The one who said (the following) was fair: 'I do not wrong the night nor claim... That the stars of the night do not move. My night is as she wished; if she does not visit... It is long, and if she visits, my night is short.' How excellent is the saying of Al-Arjani: 'Our night is but equal, but... Its difference is that we stayed awake and you slept.' Among the best said regarding the shortness of the night: The saying of Abu Ishaq al-Suli... 'And a night of the nights of Venus (Zahr)... In which I met its full moon with my full moon. It was nothing but twilight and dawn... Until it turned away while it was the virgin of time.' Al-Radi said: 'O night, due to its shortness, almost... The Isha (evening) stumbles in it on the Sahar (pre-dawn).' Another said: 'I asked the night why it turned away defeated... While the beloved spent the night at my suggestion. It said: My stars sank and traveled... Plotting against me until the morning.' Among the best said regarding the length of the night is the saying of Al-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf: 'O sleepers around me, aid me... Against the night and leave excuses. Tell me about the day, a hadith... Describe it, for I have forgotten the day.' Another said: 'My covenant with us is behind the night wrapping... And the night is longest like the glance of the eye. And now my night since they departed, may I ransom them... Is the night of the blind, so my morning is not awaited.' Ibn al-'Attariyah said: 'The eyes of darkness stayed awake with me... And the eyes of the beauties slept on me. Whenever the night complained of the abandonment of the morning... I complained to Allah of the abandonment of the beautiful (Sabah).' Ibn al-Zaqqaq said: 'I have a dwelling which estrangement made distant... My eyes were generous to it with rain. The dawn was not beautiful nor did it please me... Its whiteness since he departed in the caravan. As if the morning for us after him... Is an eye that turned white from grief.' How excellent is the saying of Judge Al-Fadil: 'We spent the night in a state where desire delights... And perhaps explanation is not possible. We guarded the night and said to it... If you leave us, the morning attacks.' Yaqut said: 'As if the Pleiades is a palm spanning the darkness... To know if the night is long or has become wide. So a night you see between east and west... Being measured by a span, how is its expiration hoped for?' Sheikh Sadr al-Din bin al-Wakil took it and said: 'By the palm of the Pleiades, while it is amputated, is measured for me... The width of darkness extended from East and West. Even if they measured it by the cubit, it would not end... So it does not end by night or my death ends.' Al-Arjani excelled in apologizing for the length of the night, saying: 'I do not claim the injustice of time nor do I see... My night increasing in length over nights. But the mirror of the morning breathed (sighed)... For worry, so it rusted its polished face.' Mudar bin al-Faq'asi said: 'And a night, people say from its darknesses... The healthy of eyes and the one-eyed are equal. As if we had from it fortified houses... Haircloth their tops and teak wood their fractures.'",

    "text": "And the daughters of Na’ash in mourning were unveiled … I realized that their morning was approaching. He also said: 'And sometimes a night in which its star gets lost … spent in sleeplessness and vigilance.' I asked him about its morning, and he replied: 'If it were alive, it would breathe.' Before presenting sections of this chapter, a subtle story should be mentioned related to the length and shortness of night, told by Abu Muhammad Ismail ibn Mansur al-Jawali. He said: My father saw a young man sitting in a circle, reading poetry with students, who said: 'O sir, I heard two lines of poetry but did not understand their meaning.' My father said: 'Recite them.' He recited: 'The beloved reached the gardens of eternity … and the fire's exile reaches us through it. The sun in Sagittarius has set … if it does not visit me, and in Gemini if it visits.' Upon hearing this, my father said: 'My son, this is about knowledge of the stars and their movement, not literary craftsmanship.' The young man left without benefit. My father felt embarrassed for being asked about something he had no knowledge of and resolved not to sit in a circle until he studied astronomy and learned the stars' paths. If the sun is in the last degrees of Sagittarius, the night is very long, at the end of autumn. If it is in the last degrees of Gemini, the night is very short, at the end of spring. So, if the sun does not visit, the night is long; if it visits, the night is short. As the poet said: 'I do not oppress the night nor claim … that the night stars follow my will; if they do not visit … the night is long, if they do, my night is short.' Al-Arjani said: 'Our night is equal, it only differs by whether we are awake or asleep.' Among the best expressions about short nights: Abu Ishaq al-Suli said: 'One night among the nights of spring, I encountered its full moon … nothing but dawn and twilight until it set, the first of time.' Al-Radi said: 'O night, if it shortens, the evening stumbles with the dawn.' Another said: 'I asked the night why it passed quickly … while my beloved slept under my proposal; my stars sped, accompanying me until morning.' Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf said about long nights: 'O you sleepers around me, assist me in the night and leave excuses. Tell me about the day, describe it, for I have forgotten it.' Another said: 'My custom throughout the night … the night is long like a glimpse of the eye. Now my night has passed, and my morning is unawaited.' Ibn al-‘Atariya said: 'The eyes of the darkness kept me awake … while the eyes of the watchers slept. When the night fled the morning, I complained to God.' Ibn al-Zuqaq said: 'I have a dwelling far away … my eyes poured rain for it. How beautiful is the dawn, but my whitened eyes from sorrow perceive it as our morning.' The judge said: 'We spent the night in the state of love’s ease … and sometimes the night is unexplainable. We told the night: if you vanish, morning will intrude.' Yaqut said: 'The Pleiades provided comfort in the darkness … to measure if the night is long or short.' Sheikh Sadr al-Din ibn al-Wakeel said: 'The Pleiades in the palm of the hand, they measure the darkness from east to west. Even if measured by the cubit, the night would not end … and neither does my desire.' Al-Arjani, apologizing for long nights, said: 'I do not claim injustice of time, nor that my night exceeds other nights. But the morning’s mirror breathes, giving light to its polished face.' Mudhar ibn al-Fuq’asi said: 'And the night that people say is dark … the clear-eyed and the blind alike experience. We had fortified houses … with high ceilings and secured rooms.'",

    "text": "Another said: 'And I have a slumber, I do not know what is the slumber of sleep... As if my eyelids are my ears and sleep is a blamer.' I said: 'Since Shams al-Din (Sun of the Religion) was absent from me, my eye... Has not been rimmed with other than the powder of insomnia and sleeplessness. How often I spent the night tending the stars of the night out of my sleeplessness... O most resembling of people, of all people, to the moon.' Al-Sharishi said: As for most poets, they are more fearful of the night and more inclined to the day, because the night is more gathering for the dispersal of worries and thoughts, and more attracting for stray sorrows and memories. Imru' al-Qais said: 'And a night like the waves of the sea lowered its curtains... Upon me with types of worries to test me.' Qays bin Dharih said: 'I spend my day with conversation and wishes... And the night brings me and worry together. My day is the day of people until when appears... To me the night, the beds shake me towards you.' Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: 'Do not meet except at night the one you join... For the sun is a talebearer and the night is a pimp. How many a lover, while the darkness of night covers him... Met loved ones while the slanderers were asleep.' Al-Mutanabbi said: 'How many a visit for you among the Bedouins is hidden... I boast of it, while they slept, over the visit of the wolf. I visit them and the blackness of night intercedes for me... And I return and the whiteness of morning incites against me.' This verse is the prince of Al-Mutanabbi's poetry despite the abundance of good in it. In it is a comparison of five against five. Some took it and said: 'I hate the day when its morning shines... And I remain waiting for the pitch-black darkness. For the morning gloats at me so it comes laughing... And the night pities me so it leaves frowning.' He excelled in taking it, for in it is also a comparison of five against five. Ibn Yahya said regarding the saying of Al-Mutanabbi mentioned that it is taken from the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz: 'For the sun is a talebearer and the night is a pimp.' Sheikh Fath al-Din bin Sayyid al-Nas said: Our Sheikh Taqi al-Din bin Daqiq al-Eid said to me: Say to these scholars of Ma'ani, Bayan, and Badi' (Rhetoric): Can you say the like of Al-Mutanabbi's saying: 'I visit them and the blackness of night' the verse? If they say No, say: Then what is the benefit in what you manufacture? He means by that that action is other than knowledge, and practice is below description. Similar to his saying is what some narrated about a preacher who was on his pulpit speaking about Love and matters of Ishq and its states, extending the ropes of verbosity in that. Some of the group stood up to him and said: 'By your life, did you embrace Laila... Before the morning or kiss her mouth? And did the branches of Laila crawl upon you... The crawling of the chamomile in its dew?' The preacher said: 'No, by Allah.' He said to him: 'Then preach.' Al-Mutanabbi said: 'And how many a hand the darkness of night has with you... Telling that the Manichaeans lie. It protected you from the destruction of enemies as you travel to them... And the one of coquetry, the veiled one, visited you in it.' The Manichaeans are a people who believe that all good is from Light and all evil is from Darkness. So he belied them in that he found good in darkness where it covered him from his enemies and protected him from their evil, and was a help to him in visiting the one he loves. Ibn Rashiq said: 'O night, fly without a wing... There is no rest for the eye in the morning. How can I not hate the morning while in it... Those of beautiful (Sabah) faces departed from me?' Al-Asma'i recounted saying: I attended the assembly of Al-Rashid, and Muslim bin al-Walid was with him, when Abu Nuwas entered. He said: 'What have you created after us, O Abu Nuwas?' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, even in wine.' He said: 'May Allah fight you, even in wine.' So he recited to him: 'O brother of the soul, who judged... I slept from Laila and did not sleep.' The verses until he came to the last of them. He said: 'You did well, by Allah. O boy, give him ten thousand dirhams and ten robes.' So he took them and left. It is told about Al-Mutarriz the poet that he passed while on his feet were worn-out sandals raising dust. Al-Sharif Al-Murtada saw him and ordered him brought. He said to him: 'Recite to me your verses in which you say: \"If my mounts do not reach me to you... Then may they not reach water nor graze on grass.\"' So he recited them to him. When he reached this verse, the Sharif pointed to his worn-out sandals and said: 'Are these of your mounts?' Al-Mutarriz looked down for an hour then said: 'When the gifts of our Master the Sharif, may Allah support him, returned to the like of his saying: \"May Allah support him to the like of his saying... And take sleep from my eyelids, for I... Have bestowed slumber upon the lovers.\" My mounts returned to the like of what you see, because you bestowed what you do not own upon one who does not accept.' The Sharif was ashamed before him. Sheikh Sadr al-Din bin al-Wakil, may Allah have mercy on him, used to say: 'By Allah, the saying of Al-Mutarriz is to me better than the saying of the Sharif.' Abu al-Bashar al-Muzaffar al-A'ma said",

    "text": "I entered upon Al-Malik Al-Kamil, and he said to me: 'Complete this hemistich: Love has reached its end.' So I said: 'And lovers did not know what it is.' He said: 'My entry deceived them.' So I said regarding it: 'So they wandered in it and got lost.' He said: 'And I have a beloved who sees my humiliation.' So I said: 'And I have not changed from his love.' He said: 'Discipline of the soul is in my endurance.' So I said: 'And the garden of beauty is in his ornaments.' He said: 'A brown one, flexible of stature, dark-lipped.' So I said: 'Everyone who sees him loves him.' He said: 'His saliva is all wine.' So I said: 'Its seal is musk from his dark lips.' He said: 'His night is all slumber.' So I said: 'And my night is all wakefulness.' Then Muzaffar al-Din completed it praising Sultan Al-Malik Al-Kamil, may Allah cover him with His mercy, grace, and generosity. Chapter Twelve: The Lack of Intellect of the Blamer and his excess of curiosity. I say: We established this chapter to mention one who increased gossip among the blamers, and deserved by holding his beard while blaming, the plucking of mustaches. How not, while he, due to his excess of curiosity and lack of result, enters between the spirit and the body, and the parent and the child? How often he became among lovers like the back of the neck between two slappers; no door is opened for him, nor is an answer returned to him. 'And the most tiring of those who called you is the one you do not answer... And the most annoying of those who opposed you is the one you do not resemble. And pride is not my character in love other than that I... Am hateful to the ignorant pseudo-wise.' Would that he rested and relieved, and protected his permissible honor. Poets have abounded in refuting him, and lovers have apologized for him, as was said: 'O my blamer regarding his love... If he appears, how can I forget? He passes by me every time... And whenever he passes, he becomes sweeter.' It used to be said: 'Not from justice is the secret of... Blame.' And it used to be said: 'Perhaps a blamed one has no sin.' And it was said: 'Perhaps she has an excuse while you blame.' How many a blamer increased the lover by his blame in persistence... And madness more than the need. 'I will surely exchange love for blame, for it is... Like the wind inciting people to burning.' Another said: 'And my blamer is not forbidding regarding you... But he is commanding patience. He said: Forget them if you cannot bear their abandonment... I said: Fire and not Shame.' Sheikh Jamal al-Din bin Nubata said: 'O you who, if eyes sold their blackness... For a grain (mole) on his cheeks, they would have profited. Blame increases me in torment which I enjoy... So would that the blamers of my heart regarding you never ceased.' How excellent is the saying of our compatriot Muhammad bin al-Afif al-Tilimsani: 'You exceeded in blame and did not fall short... And increased in your blame, O blamer. My soul was pleased with its beloved... But the Master is of much curiosity.' His father said, and excelled as he wished: 'I have rights of love against my blamer... My thanks for him answer some of them. He blamed, but when he saw him, he wandered for him... So I was the cause in his love.' Another said: 'The slanderer strove and came blaming me... And adorned for me false speech with his lies. And he said: Forget about this one and turn away from his passion... So I said to him: This is curiosity itself.' Ibn Waki' recounted that he loved a Christian boy in Tinnis, and some of his friends blamed him for it while not having seen him. It happened that the boy passed by them. When Ibn Waki's friend saw him, he admired him and said: 'If you loved this one, I would not blame you.' He did not know he was his beloved whom he blamed him for. Ibn Waki' said immediately: 'My blamer saw him... And his heart had not seen him. He said: If you loved this one... People would not blame you for his love. Tell me, to whom did you turn away from him... For the people of love have none but him? So he remained, from where he did not know... Commanding the love of whom he forbade.' The Sheikh of Sheikhs in Hama said: 'They claimed that I loved other than you... They lied; I knew nothing but your love. You have known the truthfulness of the messenger of my tear... So ask it if my heart forgot you. My blamer said to me: When will you see guidance... And forget? So I said: The day of your blindness.' He also said: 'Indeed a people who blame regarding the love of Su'da... Hardly understand a speech. They heard her description so they blamed regarding her... They took a good thing and gave a bad thing.' He also said: 'Who will do me justice regarding an ignorant blamer... Who betrays by blame one who does not betray? If I say: Your advice is nothing but harm... He says: And your love is nothing but madness.' Muhammad bin Sharaf al-Qayrawani said: 'Say to the blamer: If you looked at what... I witnessed, what concerns me would concern you. Do you repel me or return me to passion... And blame me in love or incite me? Leave me, for I am not punished for my crime... Since your religion in love is not my religion.' How excellent is the saying of the other: 'The blamer says to me in his blame... And his saying is falsehood and calumny: Is not the face of the one you loved a Qibla?... I said: And your saying is not Quran.' Another: 'Indeed the full moon of darkness startled me with his aversion... And entrusted my eyelids with tending his stars. So O my blamer, leave me, perhaps he returns to me... And O my soul, patience upon what he branded you with.' 'Arqalah said: 'The blamers said: What is it that you admired... In him, and what captivates you? I said: All of him.' Sheikh Jamal al-Din bin Nubata, may Allah have mercy on him, said: 'O disappointment of the blamer who has... Lengthened in blame and became arrogant. He tortured me then said: You forget... The love of Mama? So I said: No, no.' He also said: 'O stupid blamer, contemplate... One in whose attributes the heart has become melting. And wonder at a forelock and a forehead... Indeed in the night and the day are wonders.' Judge Muhyi al-Din bin Abd al-Zahir said: 'How much is upon my blamer and how much is for my beloved... That is a Takbir and this is his Tahlil. O my trustees, and where are trustees from me... Where is he who seeks a means to me? I am dead, so turn me (Qibla) towards him... For my life, by his right, is kissing him.' Al-Nur Al-Is'irdi said: 'I say to my blamer when he forbade me... And he found the speech when he shunned me: I knew that he is bitter in accusation... But you missed that he is sweet of tongue.' Abu al-Fath Qadus said in 'Al-Aktaf': 'Who excuses me regarding a blamer... Who blames regarding the love of a fawn? If I sought his union... He said: Suffice with the tear, checkmate (Sha).' Similar is the saying of the Sheikh of Sheikhs in Hama: 'The lovers were angry at him that I... Did not sell in his love my guidance for error. I said: You have wasted my body. He said: Indeed. I said: So that my soul goes. He said: So that.' He also said: 'They intended my weaning from a love... I was fed with as a child and an old man. So I put my hand in my pocket... And said: Leave me, or else.' Similar is the saying of Al-Wadi'i: 'O my blamer regarding her love... You exceeded in blame ignorantly. No one knows longing except... Nor ardent love except.' How excellent is the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk in this meaning: 'I love the sun (female) and the gazelle (male), and perhaps... I restrained my soul out of chastity and religiosity. And I restrained the rein of my eye striving... Until when I was exhausted, I released the rein.' And his saying also: 'I approached, and drowsiness showed of him what it showed. So I kissed him on the cheek ninety or one (times).' And his saying also: 'And a fawn resembling the Reem of the desert in his aversion... So why did he not resemble it in turning (affectionately)? He repels me from his union with an attack... So would that he repelled with that which (is better).' The Sheikh of Sheikhs in Hama said: 'To you is my migration and my intent... And in you is death and life. I felt safe that you would desolate my heart... So comfort my eye and do not.' Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: 'My sleeve crowded his sleeve so they twisted... My heart agreed with his heart so they equaled. And long did they taste love so they were branded... O delight of the eye and O my worry and O.' Ibn Matruh said: 'By Allah, forgetting has not crossed my mind... As long as I remain in the bonds of life, nor if.' The speech returns to blame. Another said a couplet: 'When the blamers saw my passion, they were dumbfounded... Immediately, and said: Blaming this one is obstinacy. We do not think but that we are blaming him... Hearing one who understands, one who pays attention.' Another said: 'They said: Forget him and cast off his love... For his lie and falsehood have appeared. I said: By Allah, do not prolong... By Allah, by Allah, I will not unfasten it.' How excellent is the saying of Shihab al-Din Ibn al-Khaymi, may Allah have mercy on him: 'And a blamer made me doubt his advice... Every time I increased in refusal, he increased in persistence.",

    "text": "My blamer is none but a lover... Who covered jealousy with blame and concealed.' Another said: 'If my blamer saw my beloved's face... We would have separated on a beautiful face.' Sheikh Burhan al-Din al-Qirati recited to me: 'Life went in blame... And aversion from a gazelle. In the path of love a life... Was lost in gossip.' Sheikh Ibrahim bin al-Mi'mar said: 'If he saw the beauty of his face... My blamer, in smiling. His soul would go just as... It was said regarding the cycle of a dirham.' He also said: 'The blamer insisted and blamed me... Regarding whom I love and scolded. So I intended to slap his head... From what I was filled with of regret. But my hand slipped... And fell on the nape of the neck and he died.' Wittier is the saying of Al-Nur Al-Is'irdi: 'And they said: Leave the beloved and abandon him always... Did you not see him after beauty plucking (hair)? Is he plucked for my sake and tires always... And I abandon him? By Allah, I am not fair.' Another said: 'Say to the blamer: You prolonged blame regarding a moon... Whose beauty increases in light every day. If you claim there is wonder in his beauty... Stand and look at the rose on his cheeks scattered.' Muhyi al-Din al-Baghdadi said: 'If one who did not see him blames me, he has... Been unjust against the absent in judgment. And if one who saw him blames me, he has... Led him astray, Allah, upon knowledge.' Al-Baha Zuhayr said: 'You are the first beloved... And for you is the future love. I have for you the affection which... Is what you knew and more perfect. The heart in you is bound... The tear in you is chained. O you who threatens with aversion... Yes, you say and you do. Your excuse in love is valid... But I distract myself. Say to the blamer: You have prolonged... To whom do you say and blame? You admonished one who does not desist... And blamed one who does not accept. The anger of the blamer is lighter than... The anger of the beloved and easier.' Abu al-Atahiya said: I met Abu Nuwas in the Congregational Mosque, so I blamed him and said to him: Has the time not come for you to desist and be deterred? He raised his head to me and said: 'Do you see me, O Atahi... Leaving those amusements? Do you see me spoiling by... Asceticism my rank among the people?' When I persisted in blaming him, he began reciting: 'Souls do not return from their error... Unless there is for them a restrainer from themselves.' So I wished I had said this verse with everything I said. Juwayan al-Qawwas said: 'I listen to the saying of the blamer with my entirety... Asking him for understanding without boredom. To pick the flowers of the rose of your talk... From between the thorns of the blamers' blame.' I said: This is the lover and the affectionate admirer. Do you not see how he listened to his blamer, the effective maker, and harvested from his blame the harvest of bees mixed with the water of facts? He is in this station among the affirmed, as Abu al-Shis said from verses: 'I find blame in your love delicious... Out of love for your mention, so let the blamers blame me.' Ibn Rashiq said: And Ibn Jabir al-Khuza'i exceeded Abu al-Shis in this saying where he says: 'I was threatened with the Sultan regarding you, but... I fear your aversion, not the Sultan. I love blame regarding you, so that if he knew... The receiver of bribes from me, who blames me. My sufficiency for people's saying after my death... This is a victim in the love of so-and-so. So I will surely spend on you my whole life... And I will surely love for you every humiliation.' I said: What I say in this station is that the author of this speech is a debtor of passion and a drinking companion of cups of wine. Do you not see how he exaggerated until he made for the blamer a wage? So his state became as was said: 'A bundle on a bundle.' He is as some masters of provinces said: 'If the commoners did not know what is in our hearts of the sweetness of pardon, they would draw near to us with crimes.' Similar to his saying 'I was threatened with the Sultan' is the saying of the other: 'If she vowed regarding you my killing in the evening... Then for death I have, in your love, a greeting. And among the strange things is my fear in love... While I have every day in your sanctuary a death.' I said: 'A blamer exaggerated in his blame... And said when my anxiety was stirred. By the cheek-hair of the beloved, will you not end?... I said: Nor by greyness and the governor.' I also said: 'They blamed me for intending my killing in love... Their speech is a type of delirium. They were ignorant and did not know that stabbing regarding the... Beloved is different from stabbing in the battlefield.'",

    "text": "I also said: 'How often the blamers contradicted my saying regarding one who... In every day his beauty increases. If I said: He became in prettiness unique (Mufrad)... They said: His swaying stature bent (Muthanna - dual/bent).' I also said: 'O my blamer, do not blame me... In the love of this Copt. And cut, with a connection between us... By Allah, the head of the cat (Qitt - pun on Copt/Cat).' I also said: 'A handsome Turk, especially the Khatayi... The Sheikh is excused for him for youthful passion. So leave me from your blame, O my blamer... For my love for the Khata (region/mistake) is the essence of correctness (Sawab).' I said regarding one named Hukm al-Hawa (Judgment of Passion): 'Hukm al-Hawa turned away, so I spent the night for that... Wandering from excess of ardent love and desire. O my blamer, do not blame me in her love... The decree was executed, and such is the Judgment of Passion.' I said: 'I say to a fawn whose heart complains of sorrow... It is Love, so submit your heart; desire is not easy. I advised you out of knowledge of love, and what I see is... My opposition, so choose for yourself what is sweet.' I said from a poem: 'I weighed my inclination to the blamer and his stature... And I saw my inclination to the stature preponderant. O my blamer, may the hand of separation not shake yours... Until you are pillowed in the dust a slab. And I have advised the sons of ardent love in passion... But they do not accept an adviser.' I said: From a poem I praised our Master Sultan Al-Malik Al-Nasir with. 'O who came blaming a wandering admirer... Regarding sweet characteristics, how bitter you are.' I said: Also from a poem praising him, may Allah perpetuate his kingdom, beginning with: 'You have from your beloved what you love and desire... So make your wine from his delicious kiss. And if his mouth appears to you smiling... Then laugh at the beard of the blamer and guffaw.' I said: Also from a poem I sent to our Master Chief Judge Taj al-Din al-Subki in Damascus of Sham. 'O dwellers of the slope, I have in Hakim a dwelling... And you are in the core of the heart dwellers. My tear increases like Banas for your slave... And the blamers upon Thawra are oxen.' And from it: 'What was of his abandonment for a time has been... And he has fulfilled now, so may the blamers not exist. I am the one who does not care in passion about what... Fulan narrates nor what Faltan said.' And from it: 'I proved the beauty of the one I desire and said to him... The blamer has no proof for what he said. He has not blamed me since he saw me in love Rajab... Joking Sha'ban, so I did not desire Sha'ban.' Note: The names of months among the Arabs were other than these names used now, because they used to call Rajab 'Al-Asamm' (The Deaf) and call Sha'ban 'Al-Adhil' (The Blamer). By this, the meaning of my saying in the last verse appears. However, poets used this meaning in the past and present. Among the best I heard in it: 'And a fawn smiling revealing bubbles... Rosy of cheek, handsome of mustache. The blamer blames me for his love... And Sha'ban did not know that I am Rajab (Deaf to blame).' I also said: 'He attacks me with coquetry as if he is... Ghazan when he attacks his deprived ones. If the branch of his stature repels me from him... Then I am the one killed by his glance and his explanation. Indeed I, by your right, in his love am an enslaved... Lover (Sabb), I became Rajab to his Sha'ban.' Their saying 'The sword preceded the blame' is a proverb of the Arabs struck regarding a matter that cannot be returned. Its origin is that Sa'd and Sa'id, two sons of Dabbah ibn Udd, went out seeking camels of theirs. Sa'd returned and Sa'id did not return. Abu Dabbah, if he saw a person coming, would say: 'Asa'd am Sa'id?' (Is it Sa'd or Sa'id / Happy or Fortunate?). Then in some of his travels he came to a place with Al-Harith bin Ka'b in the Sacred Month. Al-Harith said to him: 'I killed here a youth whose description was such and such, and took from him this sword.' Dabbah took it and recognized it. He said: 'Indeed conversation has branches (Shujun).' Then he struck him. He was blamed. He said: 'The sword preceded the blame.' Poets circulated that and versified it. Among the best I heard in it is the saying of Al-Siraj Al-Warraq: 'I said when he drew a glance... Whose edge brings death near. O my blamer, desist from me... The sword preceded the justice (Adl - pun on Adhl/Blame).' Mentioning Blame and Reproach, I recalled the saying of Abu Nuwas regarding wine: 'Leave off blaming me, for blame is incitement... And treat me with that which was the disease.' Al-Mufaddal al-Dabbi said: I entered upon Al-Rashid one day. He said: 'Guide me to a verse whose beginning is Aktham bin Sayfi in correctness of opinion and quality of advice, and whose end is Hippocrates in knowledge of medicine.' I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, you have terrified me.' He said: 'It is the saying of Abu Nuwas: Leave off blaming me... the verse.' I said: And there remains...",

He asked Ali bin Isa in the Ministry Diwan about the cure for a hangover that had clung to him. He turned away from his speech and said: 'What have I to do with this question?' Hamid made fun of him. Then he turned to the Chief Judge Abu Umar and asked him about that. The Judge cleared his throat to fix his voice, then said: 'Allah Almighty said: \"And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from.\" And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: \"Seek help in every craft from its righteous people.\" Al-A'sha is the one famous for this craft in the Jahiliyyah, and he has said: \"And a cup I drank for pleasure... And another I treated myself with from it.\" Then Abu Nuwas followed him and said: \"Leave off blaming me, for blame is incitement... And treat me with that which was the disease.\"' Hamid's face brightened then, and he said to Ali bin Isa: 'What harm would it have done you, O cold one, to answer with some of what the Chief Judge answered with? He demonstrated in answering the question with the saying of Allah Almighty first, then with the saying of the Messenger, peace be upon him, second, and clarified the Fatwa and performed the meaning and absolved himself of responsibility.' The shame on Ibn Isa from Hamid by this speech was greater than Hamid's shame from him when he initiated the question. Sheikh Sadr al-Din Ibn al-Wakil said: 'Indeed, he who made worries scorpions... Made wine, in reality, their antidote. The filter was not crucified except when... It cut the road for the wine and hindered it. And my blamer regarding wine, if he had tasted it... He would not have blamed me, but he did not taste it. He said: Cast off a yellow one whose wine extinguishes... The flame of hearts when they complain of their burning. I answered him: Taste it and take after that... In the ways of your blame if you want its separation.' The Sheikh of Sheikhs in Hama was fair where he said: 'O my blamer, one like me is not refuted... And one like you is not trusted with my blame. As long as I am empty, you will not cease concerning yourself... I fall in love and your saying is acceptable against me and for me.' Another said: 'If the dove knew my yearning towards you... It would have torn its collars out of joy (Tarab). And if my blamer tasted my ardent love... He would have yearned with me, but he did not taste it.' It is told that Sultan Salah al-Din said one day to Judge Al-Fadil: 'For a period we have not seen Al-Imad the Scribe, perhaps he is weak. Go to him and inspect his conditions.' When the Judge entered the house of Al-Imad the Scribe, he found things he disapproved of in himself, like traces of gatherings of intimacy, perfume, smell of wine, and musical instruments. So he recited to him: 'The secrets of affection from a man did not advise you... As long as he did not reach you with a hateful thing and with blame. My love for you refuses to allow me... To see you upon something of errors.' Chapter Thirteen: Mention of Allusion to Union and Visiting. I say: We established this chapter to mention the Visitor and the Visited, and what has been said about them in verse and prose, and other things regarding visiting the beloved and what indicates him of scents of perfume, as was said: 'If a caravan intended you, your breeze... Would lead them until the caravan is guided by you.' Yes, often the beloved gifted joy by his visit, and merit became his, visiting and visited, as was said: 'So for his merit, the merit in both states is his.' The visit from the beloved is not tired of, even if the heavy rain followed the drizzle in it. Among the best said regarding the visit of the beloved and his return from near is the saying of Al-Ukkuk: 'By my father! One who visited me concealing himself... Fearful of everything, anxious. A visitor, his beauty revealed him... How can the night hide a full moon that rose? He watched for heedlessness until it was possible... And watched the night-talker until he slept. He rode terrors in his visit... Then he did not greet until he bid farewell.' How excellent is the saying of Al-Mu'tazz: 'He visited me while the darkness was black of sides... And the Pleiades in the West were like a bunch of grapes. And as if the crescent was the collar of a bride... Spending the night displayed upon black tunics. O night of union, aid us with length... May Allah lengthen in you the rage of the envier.' Another said: 'She visited due to the heedlessness of the watcher... Like a doe frightened by a wolf. And the time of union from her was... Shorter than the sitting of the preacher.' The Allama Sheikh Ala' al-Din Mughlatay said in his book 'Al-Wadih Al-Mubin': Abd al-Aziz bin Saraya al-Hilli recited to us for himself, claiming it is the truest word the later ones said: 'They say to me: By Allah, what will you do... If the beloved visits you? I said: A...' Ya'qub al-Shaybani said:",

    "text": "'I said when the one I love visited, and the wing of the night... Was a garden showing stars as day. The King of Love was visited by the King of Beauty... So they increased power over existence. So spread the roses as satin when he walks... And make the gold of cups a scattering. And dismiss the eyebrow (Hajib/Doorman) of the crescent, for he has tattled... Traveling to eyes repeatedly. And veil the white of the morning and say... To the Negus of darkness: Be a curtain for the house.' Mentioning the curtain of the house, how excellent is the saying of the other, a Dubayt: 'O night, praise and eulogy befit you... Since you are to the people of love a friend and companion. Since you made the curtain of the house of worry... Do not give the morning a way against them.' Ibn al-Nabih said: 'I said to the night when it granted me a beloved... And singing that captivates minds and wine. You, O night, are my doorman, so prevent the morning... And be you, O darkness, a curtain for the house.' How excellent is the saying of Shams al-Din Muhammad Ibn al-Afif: 'And a handsome one like the full moon visited at night... So his beauty revealed the darkness when it appeared. He did not know my house, but my heart... With the flame of ardency guided him and indicated. And strange from him, an intelligent jurist... By the place of dispute, how did he infer?' Another said: 'O my beloved, and you have... Ceased not to be generous with union. You visited me part of a night... In which I spent the night anxious. When you turned away absent... The full moon set in the sky. I wish I knew who... Learned from his brother.' Bashar bin Burd said: 'O most pleasant of people in saliva, untested... Except for the testimony of the tips of toothsticks. You visited us once in the eternity, a single time... Make it two, and do not make it the egg of the rooster.' It is said the rooster lays an egg once a year; for this reason Bashar said that. Ibn al-Sa'ati said in his history: In the year six hundred ninety-six, a rooster laid an egg in Baghdad. I asked a group about that, and they informed me of it. I said: Some Sufis residing with me at the cistern told me now that a rooster laid a small egg with them and began to crow like a hen, then stayed after that for seven days and died. The speech returns. I said: 'I have a beloved, he has a loyal lover... Every day he comes to him repeatedly. I said: Visit me. He said: My love is with me... Jewelry occupies its people from being lent.' I also said from a poem: 'The beloved visited and the face of the rose was ashamed... So it yellowed when his Ban stature swayed. What was of his abandonment for a time has been... And he has fulfilled now, so may the blamers not exist. The narrowness of my living did not harm me when he joined me... The eye of the needle with loved ones is a field.' Section: Perfume indicated the Beloved. How sweet is the saying of Ibn Sakra: 'Welcome and hello to one who visited without promise... Under the darkness and did not fear the guards. She covered herself with the darkness intentionally but was not covered... And her radiance at night substituted for the firebrand. Even if the darkness folded her from us, she would be revealed by... The lightning of the veil and the perfume of the chest and the breath.' Al-Mu'tamid bin Abbad took it and said: 'Three things prevented her from visiting us... Fear of the watcher and fear of the resentful envier. The light of the forehead, the noise of jewelry, and what... Her sides contain of fragrant ambergris. Suppose the forehead, with the excess of the sleeve, she covers it... And the jewelry she removes; what is the trick for the sweat (scent)?' He said: 'A day the messenger says: She has come near... So come without waiting or clamor. She came falling to their saddles... Gifting to them with her wind the fragrance.' It is said one is guided by perfume to behavior in places where people are not known, like the bathhouse, the battlefield, and the Hajj season. Poets have ceased not to describe the places of the beloved with perfume, as Ibn al-Nabih said in it: 'If one comes seeking a dwelling for them... He says to him: Walk and inhale.' Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Numayri said regarding Zaynab sister of Al-Hajjaj from a poem: 'The valley of Na'man diffused musk when Zaynab walked... In it among shy women. It has a fragrance from Indian incense rising... Its smell comes out from the sleeves. They cover the tips of fingers out of piety... And rise at midnight veiled.' And from it: 'And when she saw the riders of Al-Numayri she turned away... Hating that they meet him, cautious.'",

    "text": "For this verse is a pleasant story that happened to its author with Al-Hajjaj, which is famous among the people of literature. I refrained from affirming it here fearing elongation. Al-Tughra'i said: 'So travel with us in the darkness of the night arbitrarily... For the whiff of perfume guides us to the quarters.' Another said: 'And the breeze of musk is not what you find... But it is that praise left behind.' Another said: 'If a scent of diffusing musk could be found... I would have found it from them miles away.' Ibn al-Rumi said: 'I followed him with a whiff from the goodness of your mention... That almost became your heard praise.' Al-Mutanabbi said: 'And scents diffuse from the goodness of praise... For them in every place, being inhaled.' Section: Among the best I heard in Visiting the Sick is the saying of Al-Tughra'i: 'They informed her that I fell ill, so she said... Is it an illness, fresh of complaint or old? And they signaled that she visit my pillow... She refused while desiring to visit. And she came to me in secret complaining... The pain of longing and the distant visiting place. And she saw me like that, so she could not control herself... But inclined upon me a side and a neck.' Sheikh Jamal al-Din bin Nubata recited to me from his own words for himself: 'And a boring one in love, when she saw... The trace of illness in my broken bone. She said: We have changed. So I said to her: Yes... I with illness and you with diseases.' How excellent is the saying of Ibn al-Sulayman: 'And I am the one you made ill and abandoned... So is there a connection (Silah) or a returner (A'id) from you for the \"One Who\" (Al-ladhi)?' Another said: 'Do not abandon one who does not get used to your abandonment... While he is the one fed with the milk of your union. And you raised his rank at the beginning... Far be it from you to cut off his origin which is \"The One Who\" (Al-ladhi).' Among the great things told about Al-Malik Al-Mu'azzam Isa son of Al-Malik Al-Adil is that Sharaf al-Din Ibn 'Unayn wrote to him while he was weak: 'Look at me with the eye of a master who ceases not... To bestow generosity, and rectify before my destruction. I am like \"The One Who\" (Al-ladhi), I need what he needs... So gain my reward and the ample praise.' So Al-Malik Al-Mu'azzam came to him himself with a purse containing three hundred dinars and said: 'You are \"The One Who\" (Al-ladhi), and this is your Connection (Silah), and I am the Returner (Al-A'id - relative pronoun).' I said: Ibn 'Unayn used Silah and Mawsool (grammatical terms) and excelled, and Al-Malik Al-Mu'azzam dealt with him in racing to understand his intent the dealing of a generous steed. Had this occurred from the like of Sibawayh, it would have been the greatest proof of his virtue and the correctness of his intelligence. So what about its occurrence from this King, exalted in rank, great in authority? How often he delighted Ibn 'Unayn and paid a debt for him. So the request was expensive with him, and the Returner rejoiced with the Connection by his righteousness, the Connected. No wonder he filled his Diwan with his praises and said about him his resonant poems: 'Generous of praise, naked of shame, brave... Beautiful of face, perfect of goodness and kindness. By your life, the signs of Isa are not hidden... It is the sun, for the furthest its light and for the nearest.' I have from a poem in this meter praising our Master Sultan Al-Malik Al-Nasir, its summary: 'The Ban branch lengthened imitating his stature... I said to it: By Allah, you have come in meaning. But the full moon and the sea fell short... Of Al-Nasir the Sultan in goodness and kindness.' Among the witty things that happened to Ibn 'Unayn this with Al-Malik Al-Mu'azzam is that he attended one time before him with a group of poets. The Sultan said to them: 'You must satirize me to my face.' They kissed the ground and asked to be excused from that. He said: 'It must be.' He insisted on them. Ibn 'Unayn said: 'We are a people who never mentioned a man... At all except he desired that he not see us.' The Sultan said to him: 'You spoke the truth.' He said: 'Our poetry is like the... ...' The Sultan said: 'No, by Allah, may Allah make you ugly.' He said: 'May Allah strike with it the root of our beards.' The speech returns to Visiting the Sick. How excellent is the saying of Al-Siraj Al-Warraq: 'My friend said while he did not visit me... And the symptom of illness was in a trace. Indeed you have changed, O my friend... And Allah knows who changed.' And his saying also: 'I fell ill, to Allah (I complain of) a people... Among them is one who shunned me. They returned (visited) and returned and returned... According to the difference of meanings.' For this verse are likes and parallels I mentioned in my book 'Al-Tari' ala al-Sukardan'. Among them is what is told about Judge Abu Bakr Ibn al-Arabi. He stopped at his circle while busy with knowledge a handsome youth with a spear in his hand. Some jurists said to him: 'Go away with this spear.' He shook the spear and said: 'Now I will strike you with it.' Judge Abu Bakr recited immediately for himself: 'He threatens me with the spear, a slender fawn... Playful with the hearts of creation, messing. If it were one spear I would have guarded against it... But it is a spear, and a second, and a third.' I asked a group of people of knowledge and literature to extract the third from this verse, but none of them answered with something substantial. Ibn al-Naqib said: 'I heard what you complain of and what you find... So the tears of the eye remained shedding on the cheek. And I sent my handwriting in visiting as a deputy... And not every handwriting is fit for visiting.' Al-Mu'tamid bin Abbad said: 'I fell ill so I withheld the visit intentionally... And not out of hatred I withheld it nor abandonment. But I feared to visit you... And see the traces of the eclipse on the full moon.' Al-Shihab Mahmud said in 'Al-Qawl bil-Mujib': 'She saw me when emaciation had taken from me... And my tears overflowed on the cheek an overflowing. She said: By my eye (Bi-ayni - also means with my eye/dear to me) is this illness... I said: You spoke truth, and by the waist also.' Al-Arjani's saying was cited in his book 'Husn al-Tawassul': 'She tricked me when she clothed my body in illness... A clothing she stripped the meat from the bones. Then she said: You are to me in love... Like my eye (Ayni). She spoke truth, but (Ayni as) a sick one.' I said when I stood upon this saying of Al-Arjani, improvising: 'I complained to the beloved of my bad luck... And what I endured of the pain of distance. She said: Indeed your luck is like my eye... I said: Yes, but in blackness.' How excellent is the saying of Mahasin al-Shawwa: 'And when the blamers came to me, I lacked them... And there is nothing in them but for the fever a Fard (old camel/obligatory prayer). And they were dumbfounded when they saw me pale... And said: In him is an eye (evil eye). I said: And a cheek (Arid - also obstacle).' Ibn al-Naqib said: 'And there is nothing in me but an eye that looked at her beauty... And that is due to my ignorance of eyes and my delusion. And they said: In him regarding love is an eye and a look... They spoke truth: the eye of the beloved and my look.' The origin in all this: 'And they came to him with amulets and incantations... And poured water on him for the pain of relapse. And they said: In him is a look from the eyes of Jinn... And if they spoke truth, they would say: In him are eyes of humans.' How excellent is the saying of our compatriot Muhammad bin Afif al-Tilimsani regarding a handsome one who makes Kafiyas (headgear/rhymes): 'The name of my beloved and what he suffers... Has occupied my mind and intellect. They said: Ali. I said: Destiny (Qadran). They said: Kawafi. I said: My heart.' And the saying of Sheikh Sadr al-Din bin al-Wakil: 'And I have one who hardened in heart and softened in side... If I said: Draw me near, he doubles my distancing. He admits to my slavery (Riqqi) when I say I am his... And how often he said it also, but to threaten me.' Al-Siraj Al-Warraq said: 'They said: And all my interests were lost... To the worries of a soul, would that I had not borne it. You had, O so-and-so, a determination... So I answered them: I sold the donkey and sold it (the determination).' Chapter Fourteen: The Watcher, the Talebearer, and the Slanderer of many words. I say: We established this chapter to mention every watcher, jealous of eye, of many lies. He sees the lover with the eye of hatred at all times, and shoots him in presence and absence with every hitting arrow. How often he left the lover emaciated and impoverished him regarding whom he loved, and he did not become rich. He is like the morning, cutter of pleasures, miserable of movements, ugly of appearance, bad of substance, of much persistence, a stone in a glass shop. He and the Talebearer are in harm two racehorses suckling milk. Among the most eloquent I heard regarding the Watcher: 'I and Love were not alone nor for a blink... Of an eye except there was a watcher over us. We were not alone such that time made possible... That I say: You are the beloved. Rather we were alone to the extent that you said: ... My separation has neared. So I said: How is the doctor?' And the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz: 'And my tribulation in presence and absence... From a beloved, distant from me, near. The eye did not see the blood of his face except... It choked before drinking it on a watcher.' He also said: 'And the sun approached setting... And my driving to the beloved neared. Blessed is he who lived a tenth of a day... Having a beloved without a watcher.' It was said to some Arab: What is the most enjoyable of worldly pleasures? He said: Joking with the beloved and the absence of the watcher. Al-Sahib Ibn Abbad said: 'He said to me: Indeed my watcher is bad-mannered, so tolerate him... I said: Leave him; your face is the Paradise surrounded by hateful things.' Another said: 'The arrow of love is a wound in my heart... And that wound is from the eye of the watcher. He entrusts his two eyes to us and resembles... The place of the Writers (Angels) regarding sins. If the watcher fell from the Pleiades... He would fall on a lover or a beloved.' Another said:",

    "text": "'He gives you drink from his palm a wine... More delicious than the negligence of the watcher. As if it, when it cleared and thinned... Is the complaint of a lover to a beloved.' Abu Nuwas said: 'I glanced at him so he smiled... And the place was empty so he greeted. And the watcher appeared so I said: No... May the watcher be safe from blindness.' Al-Safi al-Hilli said: 'And a handsome one who has an ugly watcher... Who suffers while other than him enjoys. There is no meaning in him to be said, but... He came for a meaning (Ma'na) at the grammatical syntax (Nahw - pun on direction/grammar).' Another said: 'She said: The time is clear but the watcher is like the mote (in the eye)... I said: If the watcher is absent, satisfy me? She said: If.' Another said: 'I love the blamer for his repeating... The talk of the beloved to my hearing. And I desire the watcher because the watcher... Is (there) if my love is with me.' Abu Ja'far Ahmad bin al-Abbar said: 'He visited me hidden from the watcher, suspicious... The branch complaining of the depressed one. He said to me: Do you not see the watcher overlooking? I said: Visit him, he came to the spacious yard. Give him cups of wine continuously... And circulate them to him, cup after cup. And give it to me drink with the wine of your eyes pure... And make the cup from you a cold mouth. Then when the one we fear slept... And met slumber hearing, answering. He said: You must crawl to him... I said: I seek a fawn and take a wolf? He said: So start with us and double on him... I said: No, I have seen a wonder. So we jumped on the gazelle riding... And we crawled on the watcher crawling. Have you seen or have you heard of a lover... Who f****d his beloved and f****d the watcher?' Ibn Bassam said: Ibn al-Abbar was witty and pious and excelled as he wished and estimated. I think if he had power over Iblis who took charge of this school, he would have crawled on him and he would not have escaped his hand. Ibn al-Mu'tazz alluded and did not declare where he said: 'So there was what was of what I do not mention... So think good and do not ask about the news.' Abu Nuwas said: 'If the sleepers slept, then leave me... And whoever was fit for crawling. The most delicious f*****g is what was by force... With the prevention of love or fear of the watcher.' Abu al-Walid Muhammad bin Hassan al-Hanafi said: 'The spreading of the breeze becomes known by your scent... And the brother of passion is honored by your love. The honor of the enslaved in your love is that he... Sometimes wails and at times regrets. A lover, if he concealed passion and did not reveal... The shedding tears told on him about it. His meanings became subtle so he blew with the east wind... And his watcher blows with it not known. The watcher did not know his visit because he... Is more hidden to him than the breeze and subtler. And as if the breeze comes to your dwellings... And has a stop at those dwellings.' Urwa bin Abdullah said: Urwa ibn Udhayna al-Laythi was staying in the house of Abu al-Aqiq, so I heard him reciting for himself: 'Indeed, she who claimed your heart got bored of her... Was created as your desire just as desire was created for her. So if you find whispers of solace for her... Intercede for a conscience to the heart then ask it. A white one, bliss came early to her so it formed her... With elegance, so it made her fine and majestic. When I presented to a Muslim a need of mine... I fear its difficulty and hope for its solution. She prevented her greeting, so I said to my companion... How much of it was for us and how little. So he drew near and said to us: Perhaps she is excused... In some of her shyness. So I said: Perhaps she is.' Abu al-Sa'ib al-Makhzumi came to me, so I said to him after welcoming and cheer: 'Do you have a need?' He said: 'Yes, verses by Urwa; it reached me that you heard him reciting them.' So I recited the verses to him. When I reached the saying 'So he drew near and said: Perhaps she is excused', he rejoiced and shouted and said: 'This, by Allah, is the enduring of ardent love, the truthful, not like the one who says: If your family prevents you out of desire... From me, then my family is more miserly with me and more desirous.' The Bedouin exceeded his limit. I hope Allah forgives the author of these verses for his good opinion of her and seeking an excuse for her. He said: So I offered him food. He said: 'No, by Allah, I would not mix food with these verses until night.' And he left. Ibn Rashiq said: 'The one I love was harmed by my glance and said to me... I fear from the sitters that they realize about us. And said: If you repeat your glance, excluding them... At me, the proof of our suspicion is not hidden. So I said: We have been afflicted with the watcher. He said: We have not... Been afflicted, but the watcher has been afflicted with us.' Another said:",

He entrusts his two eyes to us and resembles... The place of the Writers (Angels) regarding sins. If the watcher fell from the Pleiades... He would fall on a lover or a beloved.' Another said:",

    "text": "'He gives you drink from his palm a wine... More delicious than the negligence of the watcher. As if it, when it cleared and thinned... Is the complaint of a lover to a beloved.' Abu Nuwas said: 'I glanced at him so he smiled... And the place was empty so he greeted. And the watcher appeared so I said: No... May the watcher be safe from blindness.' Al-Safi al-Hilli said: 'And a handsome one who has an ugly watcher... Who suffers while other than him enjoys. There is no meaning in him to be said, but... He came for a meaning (Ma'na) at the grammatical syntax (Nahw - pun on direction/grammar).' Another said: 'She said: The time is clear but the watcher is like the mote (in the eye)... I said: If the watcher is absent, satisfy me? She said: If.' Another said: 'I love the blamer for his repeating... The talk of the beloved to my hearing. And I desire the watcher because the watcher... Is (there) if my love is with me.' Abu Ja'far Ahmad bin al-Abbar said: 'He visited me hidden from the watcher, suspicious... The branch complaining of the depressed one. He said to me: Do you not see the watcher overlooking? I said: Visit him, he came to the spacious yard. Give him cups of wine continuously... And circulate them to him, cup after cup. And give it to me drink with the wine of your eyes pure... And make the cup from you a cold mouth. Then when the one we fear slept... And met slumber hearing, answering. He said: You must crawl to him... I said: I seek a fawn and take a wolf? He said: So start with us and double on him... I said: No, I have seen a wonder. So we jumped on the gazelle riding... And we crawled on the watcher crawling. Have you seen or have you heard of a lover... Who f****d his beloved and f****d the watcher?' Ibn Bassam said: Ibn al-Abbar was witty and pious and excelled as he wished and estimated. I think if he had power over Iblis who took charge of this school, he would have crawled on him and he would not have escaped his hand. Ibn al-Mu'tazz alluded and did not declare where he said: 'So there was what was of what I do not mention... So think good and do not ask about the news.' Abu Nuwas said: 'If the sleepers slept, then leave me... And whoever was fit for crawling. The most delicious f*****g is what was by force... With the prevention of love or fear of the watcher.' Abu al-Walid Muhammad bin Hassan al-Hanafi said: 'The spreading of the breeze becomes known by your scent... And the brother of passion is honored by your love. The honor of the enslaved in your love is that he... Sometimes wails and at times regrets. A lover, if he concealed passion and did not reveal... The shedding tears told on him about it. His meanings became subtle so he blew with the east wind... And his watcher blows with it not known. The watcher did not know his visit because he... Is more hidden to him than the breeze and subtler. And as if the breeze comes to your dwellings... And has a stop at those dwellings.' Urwa bin Abdullah said: Urwa ibn Udhayna al-Laythi was staying in the house of Abu al-Aqiq, so I heard him reciting for himself: 'Indeed, she who claimed your heart got bored of her... Was created as your desire just as desire was created for her. So if you find whispers of solace for her... Intercede for a conscience to the heart then ask it. A white one, bliss came early to her so it formed her... With elegance, so it made her fine and majestic. When I presented to a Muslim a need of mine... I fear its difficulty and hope for its solution. She prevented her greeting, so I said to my companion... How much of it was for us and how little. So he drew near and said to us: Perhaps she is excused... In some of her shyness. So I said: Perhaps she is.' Abu al-Sa'ib al-Makhzumi came to me, so I said to him after welcoming and cheer: 'Do you have a need?' He said: 'Yes, verses by Urwa; it reached me that you heard him reciting them.' So I recited the verses to him. When I reached the saying 'So he drew near and said: Perhaps she is excused', he rejoiced and shouted and said: 'This, by Allah, is the enduring of ardent love, the truthful, not like the one who says: If your family prevents you out of desire... From me, then my family is more miserly with me and more desirous.' The Bedouin exceeded his limit. I hope Allah forgives the author of these verses for his good opinion of her and seeking an excuse for her. He said: So I offered him food. He said: 'No, by Allah, I would not mix food with these verses until night.' And he left. Ibn Rashiq said: 'The one I love was harmed by my glance and said to me... I fear from the sitters that they realize about us. And said: If you repeat your glance, excluding them... At me, the proof of our suspicion is not hidden. So I said: We have been afflicted with the watcher. He said: We have not... Been afflicted, but the watcher has been afflicted with us.' Another said:",

    "text": "And a watcher—may I be deprived of no watcher [like him]... black of face, nape, and attributes. He is like the night in darkness, and to me... he is like the morning, cutting off pleasures. I asked our friend Sheikh Burhan al-Din al-Qirati at that time: 'Do you memorize anything beautiful regarding the satire of the watcher?' He remained silent for a moment, then recited of his own composition: 'A friend said to me desiring a poem... in satire of the watcher, for he is ugly. Do you have anything beautiful regarding the watcher?... I said: There is nothing beautiful about a watcher.' And I said from a poem: 'May I be your ransom, the watcher is gone, so sing to me... and say regarding a heavy bore: his bad luck is absent. A watcher banished from Layla's land in the evening... and he was driven out of it, fearful and vigilant.' And I also said: 'My blamer regarding the beloved, leave me, for... the intensity of love has exhausted me. Observe Allah regarding a loving lover... for the stars of the night are watchers.' And I also said from a poem: 'So I spent the night occupied by a distraction from blame... that drives slumber away from me, a driver of sleeplessness.' And I also said from a message: 'As for the watcher, his matter is strange, and closing the door in his face is a victory from Allah and a near conquest. By day, he is of those who show off, and by night, a son of a whore who does not sleep nor let people sleep. His harm, if it comes from afar, is closer than the jugular vein. Between the lover and the blamer, he utters no word except that there is a watcher ready with him. If he sits, the Resurrection rises, and if he leaves, may Allah not write safety for him.' \n\nChapter: The Slanderer and the Informer. \nHow witty is what I heard regarding that. My lute said to me in the morning when they saw me... 'What do you desire?' and they pressed me. I said: 'Fried in it are the tongues of slanderers... which they cut into it with wondrous skill. And they added to it the liver of an envious one... upon which the eyes of a watcher were gouged out.' This is taken from the speech of some lovers when asked: 'What do you desire?' He said: 'The eyes of watchers, the tongues of slanderers, and the livers of the envious.' Another said: 'I have a wish from them on the day of connection... O assembly of sitters and drinking companions: That I roast with it the hearts of the envious... and the tongues of slanderers and the eyes of watchers.' The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'The most hateful of you to me are those who walk with gossip, who separate loved ones.' And he (peace be upon him) said: 'Four types of people harm the people of Hellfire in addition to the harm they already suffer... among them: a man who eats the flesh of people and walks with gossip.' Waddah al-Yaman said: 'So disobey the slanderers, for... the speech of slanderers is temptation (Fitnah). Indeed, if slanderers come to you... they advise you and forbid you from [love].' It is narrated that Ma'n sang in the presence of Sultan Imad al-Din Zanki, the ruler of Sham, the words of the poet: 'Woe is me from the angry one who turned away when... the slanderer conveyed to him a hadith entirely false. I greeted him, but he turned away, bending the bow of his eyebrow... as if I were a bow of wine and he was drunk.' The Sultan admired them and said: 'Whose are they?' It was said: 'Ibn Munir.' So he ordered him to be brought to make him a boon companion and elevate his status in his presence. Al-Sari said: 'I meet you with beautiful cheer, flattering... but I have no flatterer in you, as far as I know. You are, regarding what I entrusted to you, like a glass bottle... the thing inside it is seen as visible while it is hidden.' Shihab al-Din al-Athir said: 'I am madly in love with you... and other than your love is forbidden to hearts. Do not listen to the words of slanderers, for they... added to speech, decreased it, and completed it [with lies]. My wish is that you be pleased, even if by my death... any divorce three times is binding upon me.' Another said: 'A sheikh who views the five prayers as voluntary... and deems the blood of pilgrims permissible in the Sanctuary. I cannot count his traits due to their abundance... but they are gathered in Nun and the Pen.' He refers to the Almighty's saying: 'A slanderer, going about with calumnies, a hinderer of good, a transgressor, sinful, cruel, and after all that, base-born (zanim).' It came in the interpretation that the 'Hammaz' is the one who backbites people, meaning mentions them with unpleasantness and eats their flesh through defamation and gossip. Al-Hasan said: 'He is the one who twists his jaws at the backs of people.' It is said the 'Humaza' is the one who criticizes to the face, and 'Lumaza' behind the back, and it is said the opposite. It is also said 'Humaza' is openly and 'Lumaza' is secretly with the eyebrow and eye. The 'Nammam' is the transporter of bad speech. Poets have frequently censured him, but Ibn Rashiq disagreed with them, saying: 'Why do our brothers hate the slanderer... my brothers have done evil and not good. If he is a slanderer, then his reverse (Ma'kus)... without lying to them, is a safe haven (Ma'man).' [Note: This is a wordplay]. Another said:",

    "text": "'Listen to the advice of a knower... who combined advice with affection. Beware and be cautious of being... confident in those who are trustworthy.' Another said: 'A gathering is pure, but a slanderer muddies it... and a watcher causes pain with blame. There is no striver (sa'in) in it except the cupbearer, and there is no slanderer (nammam) among the drinking companions except the basil (rayhan).' [Note: pun on 'nammam' which means slanderer and a type of plant]. Another said: 'For my exposure in his cheeks... there is a cause, and people are blaming. How can I hide what I endure... when the one I love is a Nammam (slanderer/basil)?' Sheikh Sadr al-Din ibn al-Wakil said: 'I hid your love from all my limbs... but my eyes told on me (washat), and slanderers are eyes. I wished that my ribs and limbs... were eyes that could see you, but they have no eyes. O would that Qays were in the time of my ardent love... so I could show him how love should be.' \n\nChapter Fifteen: Reproach upon the Meeting of Loved Ones, and what relates to that of Contentment and Pardon for what has passed. \nI say: We have dedicated this chapter to mentioning the reproach that... [text unclear]... and spreading a passion softer than the languid breeze. Yes, in reproach there are many benefits and the removal of distress, so let not your affair be a source of blindness to you. It is of sections: Reproach that confirms affection and obtains the result, reproach to belie the conveyor [of gossip], and reproach to distinguish truth from falsehood. It is known that reproach between loved ones has a root and merit, cutting and connecting; it is inevitable and indispensable. Except for those who do not see it at all, or only reproach the beloved as a slip, like Al-Buhturi when he says: 'I reproach the beloved for what came once... then peace be upon him, I will not reproach him.' In the proverbs of the Arabs: 'The worst of manners is excessive reproach.' Al-Ahnaf said: 'Reproach is the key to hatred, but reproach is better than malice.' Bashar said regarding minimizing reproach: 'If in all matters you are reproaching... your friend, you will not find one whom you do not reproach. If you do not drink repeatedly over specks [in the water]... you will thirst, and which people's drink is pure?' Sa'id bin Hamid the scribe said: 'Lessen your reproach, for remaining [together] is brief... and time acts fairly once and leans [unfairly] another. Perhaps the days of life are short... so why should our reproaching increase and lengthen?' Another said: 'Some reproach, if you raise it... distances abandonment or brings closeness. So reproach your brother and do not shun him... for every station has a speech.' Among the wittiest things I heard regarding one who shunned loved ones then initiated reproach is the saying of some of them: 'You reproached me, but I have no sin... regarding what the sin is in, and no doubt belongs to you. You feared my blame, so you hastened... to blame me before I could hasten to you. So we were as it was said in the past... \"Catch the thief before he catches you.\"' Some of them dislike reproach entirely and say it is the key to abandonment and the means to repulsion and estrangement, as was said: 'Do not acknowledge listening to whom... you love by recounting sins. None debates loved ones except... one who lives without a lover.' Some see it and do not refuse it, as was said: 'Two lovers reconciled upon reproach... and they did not separate until the Day of Judgment. There is no life like union after abandonment... and nothing is more delicious than reproach. Neither this one tires of the other's speech... nor that one tires of the answer.' Another said: 'The best days of love is your day in which... you threaten with abandonment and reproach. If there is no anger or contentment in love... then where is the sweetness of messages and letters?' Al-Hasan wrote a letter to a boy seeking his sympathy, but the boy signed on his letter: 'Increased in abandonment until the Day of Resurrection.' So Al-Hasan said: 'I wrote to the beloved a verse of poetry... reproaching him, but my answer angered him: \"Answer me, O bored one, to my letter... for the soul finds rest in the answer.\" So he signed on the letter: \"Increased in abandonment... and distance until the Day of Reckoning.\"' I mentioned here the saying of Ibn Rashiq: 'My heart belongs to a boy of the scribe class who captivates... the hearts of lovers with his eyes. I raised [a petition] to him seeking his satisfaction... and asking him for deliverance from his hands. So he signed: \"The heart of this one has been rejected... pardoned, so let there be no aggression against him.\"' The erudite Sheikh Abu al-Thana Shihab al-Din Mahmud said, incorporating [verses]: 'We spent the night under the rule of ardent love, my ambition... my sighing and my guts, and drinking tears. And my love hands me cups of blame... and recites to me while worry splits the heart:'",

    "text": "'Do you hope for union from Layla, while... the hopes cut the necks of men? So I spent the night as if a slender snake... of the speckled ones attacked me, in whose fangs the poison is soaking.' I said: This incorporation contains insight and a lesson for those who take heed. How not, when its sayer mixed poison with saliva, and attached the beloved to the snakes? He became desperate, likening his beloved's mouth to slender fangs, meeting the purity of his reproach with turbidity. O you of hard heart, are you iron or stone? I do not think he filled the cups of this blame except from the water of Abu Tammam's blame, where he exceeded the limit in metaphor and went out carrying blame on his shoulder reluctantly, saying: 'Do not give me the water of blame to drink, for I... am a lover who has found the water of my weeping sweet.' Why did he not refrain from engaging in this path and follow the saying of Ibn Sana al-Mulk: 'I hope for a reproach that is found sweet, so would that I... prolonged my sins so his reproach would prolong. And in my ghazal (love poetry) is the mention of Al-Udhayb and Bariq... and it is nothing but his mouth and his saliva.' Or [why did he not] adopt the manners of people and follow suit? Abu Firas says: 'He did evil, so the evil increased him in favor... a beloved, despite what comes from a beloved. He counts his sins against the female slanderers... and from where does a beautiful face get sins?' However, may Allah have mercy on him, it is possible he intended a meaning of high value; in that case, my speech would be 'the talk of Khurafa, O Umm Amr.' 'How many a fault-finder of correct speech... while his bane is from his sick understanding.' Another said: 'And if the beloved comes with a single sin... his beauties come as a thousand intercessors.' Better than that is the saying of Atiq bin Muhammad al-Warraq: 'Whenever he sins, his face shows... an argument, for he is rich in arguments. How can one who, if he wished, exits from the sin... be excessive in his crimes?' Al-Hakam bin Qanbar al-Mazini said: 'As if the sun flashed from his sides... in beauty, and the full moon rose from his buttons. He is met with what he desires, and even if his evil deeds increase... he is excused for what he did. In his face is an intercessor that wipes out his evil... from hearts; a distinguished one wherever he intercedes.' This is taken from the saying of Abu Nuwas in his context: 'My face, if I approach, intercedes for me... and the tribulation of your eye is the beauty of my behind.' There is an addition mentioning what is behind her, but Al-Hakam's verse is a structure and sweeter praise. Abu Firas said: 'Say to our loved ones, the criminals against us... you have trained us to endure boredom. Do good in your deeds or do evil... we will not lack you in any case.' He also said: 'O you criminal, while we ask him for satisfaction... and O you sinner, while we repent. May Allah curse the one who observes you only when near... and does not regard the unseen when you are absent.' Another said: 'If we fall ill, we come to visit you... and you sin, yet we come to apologize.' Another said: 'And if I get angry at him one day... for sins about which speech would be long. The emotions of love bend me until... I seek his satisfaction so that boredom may cease.' Another said: 'My arguments against you when alone are many... but when you are present, I am defeated. I cannot say \"You wronged me\"... while Allah knows that I am the oppressed.' Al-Qarra' said: 'If this were a place for reproach, my heart would be healed, but reproach has its places.' Ibn al-Mu'tazz said: 'Accept the excuses of one who comes to you apologizing... whether he is truthful in your view in what he said or lying. For he who satisfies you outwardly has obeyed you... and he who disobeys you secretly has honored you.' I said in my letter 'Knocking on the Door and Waiting for the Answer': We seek refuge in Allah from the slip of the wise, and declare innocence to Him from persisting in falsehood. 'This truth has no obscurity... so leave me from the side roads.' The truth has become manifest, and reproach knocked on the door ring, saying 'knock'. Another said: 'Grant that he refrained after the reproach; was not... his affection natural, then became affectation?' It is as if I see our master standing at the threshold of reproach saying 'Who knocked on the door heard the answer', so he answered them: 'If you find in that a burden... leave me to die of passion and do not burden yourselves.' \n\nSection on Pardon and Contentment, and Forgiving What Has Passed. \nIt came from Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, regarding the Almighty's saying 'So overlook with beautiful forgiveness' that it means contentment without reproach. The Almighty said: 'And let them pardon and overlook. Do you not like that Allah should forgive you?' The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'Whoever does not accept from an apologizer, whether truthful or lying, will not come to the Basin [in the afterlife].' The poet said:",

    "text": "'My sin against you is great... and you are greater than it. So take your right first... then forgive it by your grace. If I am not in my deeds... of the noble, then you be [one of them].' Another said: 'How beautiful is pardon from the capable... especially towards one with no helper. O goal of intent and furthest wish... and best pasture for the eye of the beholder. If I have a sin—and I have no sin... then it has no forgiver but You. I seek refuge in the affection between us... that you do not spoil the first by the last.' Abu Muhammad al-Yazidi used to drink with Al-Mamun, and wine overcame him one night, so he became rowdy. Al-Mamun ordered him to be carried to his home gently. When he sobered up, he was ashamed and stopped riding [to the court] for days. When it went on too long, he wrote verses to Al-Mamun, including: 'I am the sinner, the frequent wrongdoer, and pardon is vast... if there were no sin, pardon would not be known. I got drunk, so the cup revealed some of what... I hated; and drunkenness and sobriety are not equal. Especially if I was with a Caliph... and in a gathering where nonsense is not permitted.' When Al-Mamun read them, he signed on the note: 'Come to us, for we have pardoned you, so there is no blame on you; the carpet of wine folds what is with it.' The poet took it and said: 'The gathering of drink is but a carpet... so when it is over, we fold its carpet.' Ibn Sana al-Mulk said: 'And that is not the beloved, for he attended graciously and came humbly, not coquettishly, and sought refuge in the sanctuary of respect, and lowered the wing of humility out of mercy. He apologized that coquetry led him to arrogance, dropped him into matters, and brought him out of darkness into light. So he accepted his excuse, kissed his mouth, obeyed his command, and turned the rein of the heart to him with good turning, and the sweetness of gathering his saliva removed the bitterness of his transgression.' 'And if the beloved comes with a single sin... his beauties come with a thousand intercessors.' Another said: 'You claimed that I am unjust, so you abandoned me... and shot into my heart a penetrating arrow. Yes, I wronged you, so excuse and overlook... this is the station of the one seeking refuge, the returning one.' Ibn Zaydun said: 'O moon whose rising place is the West... the way has become narrow for me in your love. You compelled me to the sin I committed... you spoke truth, so forgive, for I am the sinner. For one of the strangest things I have encountered... is that my torment in you is sweet.' Another said: 'I did not meet your pardon with an excuse... but I say as you say. I will knock on the door of your pardon with an apology... and let beautiful tolerance judge between us.' \n\nChapter Sixteen: Aiding the Poor Lover When the Knife Reaches the Bone. \nI say: We have dedicated this chapter to mentioning the most chivalrous of people, the most abundant in manliness, the softest in heart, and the best in upbringing among those who have become, among lovers, old in abandonment and migration, and for whom a thousand intoxications touch him from the cups of love. No doubt he helped the people of love and balanced himself against the grain of passion in his heart, striving to fix his condition and equating him with himself and his wealth. Allah is the Sayer in this meaning: 'Stand longing, or aiding, or sad... or helping, or excusing, or blaming. If you are free from all that... I mean with false hopes in distance. If you do not fight, O coward, then encourage.' I said: Or not less than that, O daughter of Malik. And [text unclear] the Sayer in that: 'If people knew of my longing and who is sufficient... I would not have spent the night teaching them to pray for rain by appointment. And they would intercede for me to my beloved, all of them... and their visitor would come leading [others].' Among the most amazing things I heard regarding aiding the lover and taking revenge for him is what Al-Jahiz narrated: He said, 'It reached me that a lover died in India out of love, so the King of India sent for the beloved and killed him.' Al-Khara'iti said: 'There was a copper merchant who had a slave girl; he had no comfort other than her. He used to display her in seasons, and people bid high for her until she reached a large amount of money while he asked for increase. A poor man became attached to her, and his mind almost went. When [the merchant] learned of this, he gifted her to him. He was reproached for that, so he said: \"I heard Allah say: 'And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely.' Should I not save mankind entirely?\"' Al-Khara'iti narrated that one of the Caliphs had a boy servant and a slave girl among his servants who loved each other. The boy wrote to her one day: 'I saw you in a dream as if... you gave me your cold saliva to drink. And as if your hand was in my hand, and as if we... spent the night together in one bed. So I began to pretend to sleep throughout my sleep... to see you in my sleep, though I was not sleeping.' The girl answered him:",

And I see you between my anklets and bracelets... and I see you above my collarbones and body.' The news of them reached the Caliph, so he married them and treated them well despite his intense jealousy. Abu al-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi said: Al-Muhallab heard a youth singing about a slave girl of his, so Al-Muhallab said: 'By my life, I am merciful to lovers... and I am worthy of kindness to lovers. I will gather your scattered union... and I am capable of what you hope for.' Then he gifted her to him along with five thousand dinars. It is narrated about Uthman bin Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, that a slave girl came to him seeking justice against a man from the Ansar. Uthman asked her, 'What is your story?' She said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I love his nephew, and I constantly watch over him.' Uthman said to him, 'Either you give her to your nephew, or I will give you her price from my money.' He said, 'I call you to witness, O Commander of the Faithful, that she belongs to my nephew.' A boy from the Arabs was brought to Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah honor his face, found in a people's house at night. He said to him, 'I am not a thief, but I will tell you the truth. I became attached in the house of Al-Riyahi to a young woman... the sun and moon humble themselves to her beauty. She has beauty and lineage among the daughters of the Romans... if she boasts of beauty, glory confirms her. When I knocked on the house out of the heat of a soul... I spent the night while in it was an ember of its burning. The people of the house rushed at me then shouted... \"He is the thief,\" destined for killing and capture.' When Ali heard his poetry, he felt pity for him and said to Al-Muhallab, 'Allow him to have her, and we will compensate you for her.' He said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, ask him so we know his lineage.' He said, 'Al-Nahhash bin Utbah Al-Ajli.' He said, 'Take her, she is yours.' Al-Tamimi narrated in his book 'Imtizaj al-Nufus' that Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan bought a slave girl from Bahrain and admired her greatly. One day he heard her reciting verses, including: 'And I parted from him like a branch shaking in the moist earth... a handsome youth with a first beard growth.' He asked her, and she told him, 'He is a cousin of mine.' So he returned her to him while sparks of fire were in his heart [from jealousy/loss]. Al-Khara'iti mentioned that Al-Mahdi went out for Hajj. When he was at Zubala and sat down for lunch, a young Bedouin entered upon him and wept, saying, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I am a lover,' and raised his voice. He said to the doorkeeper, 'Woe to you, what is this?' He said, 'A person shouting that he is a lover.' He said, 'Bring him in.' So they brought him in. He said, 'Who is your beloved?' He said, 'My cousin.' He said, 'Does she have a father?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Why does he not marry you to her?' He said, 'There is something here, O Commander of the Faithful.' He said, 'What is it?' He said, 'I am a Hajin (mixed breed),' and a Hajin is one whose mother is not Arab. Al-Mahdi said to him, 'So what?' He said, 'It is a defect among us.' So he sent for her father. He was brought. He said, 'Is this your nephew?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Why do you not marry your noble daughter to him?' He said to him like his nephew's statement. There were a group of Abbasid children with him. He said, 'All of these are Banu Abbas, and they are Hajins (born of slave mothers); so what harm does that do them?' He said, 'It is a defect among us.' Al-Mahdi said to him, 'Marry him to her for twenty thousand dirhams: ten thousand for the defect, and ten thousand as her dowry.' He said, 'Yes.' So he praised Allah and extolled Him, and married him to her. He brought two bags of money and gave them to him. The young man recited: 'I bought a doe at a high price, and... high prices are only paid for her likes by my likes. I left the markets of the ugly to their people... for the ugly, even if cheap, are expensive.' Khalid bin Abdullah Al-Qasri inspected his prison one day, and in it was Yazid bin So-and-so Al-Ajli. Khalid said to him, 'Why were you imprisoned, O Yazid?' He said, 'Suspicion, may Allah reform the Emir.' He said, 'Will you return if I release you?' He said, 'Yes, O Emir.' He hated to expose his story lest his beloved be exposed. Khalid said, 'Bring the men of the tribe so we may cut off his hands in their presence.' Yazid had a brother who wrote poetry and sent it to Khalid: 'O Khalid, this is a distracted lover... glances struck him, he is not a thief. He confessed to what he did not do... he saw cutting [of the hand] better than the scandal of a girl. If what I feared of his hand being cut happened... you would have found regarding his matter no speaker. If banners appear for racing in highness... then you, O son of Abdullah, are the first winner.' When Khalid read the verses, he knew the truth of his statement. He summoned the guardians of the girl and said, 'Marry your girl to Yazid.' They said, 'But after what appeared about him?' He said, 'If you do not marry him willingly, you will marry him unwillingly.' So they married him, and Khalid paid the dowry from his own wealth. Ahmad bin Al-Fadl the scribe mentioned that a boy and a girl were in a school; the boy loved her. He kept being kind to his teacher until he placed him near her. One day, when the other boys were unaware, he wrote on the girl's tablet:",

    "text": "'What do you say regarding one whom sickness has wasted... from the length of loving you until he became bewildered?' When the girl read it, her eyes filled with tears out of mercy for him, and she wrote beneath it: 'If we see a lover whom the length of ardor has harmed... we bestow kindness upon him.' The teacher came and heard that from their whispering, so he took the tablet and wrote these two verses: 'Connect the monitor ('Arif) and do not fear anyone... the monitor has become young and lovestruck. As for the Faqih (teacher), no harm will assault him... for he has been worn out by love of various kinds.' Al-Khara'iti mentioned from Abu Assaf, who said: Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, passed by a slave girl saying: 'I loved him before my amulets were cut... walking together like a soft branch.' He asked her, 'Are you free or a slave?' She said, 'A slave.' He said, 'Who is your love?' She hesitated. He swore upon her, so she recited: 'I am the one with whose heart passion played... I was killed by the love of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim.' So he bought her from her master and sent her to Muhammad ibn al-Qasim ibn Ja'far ibn Abi Talib and said, 'These [women] are the temptation of men; how many a noble man, by Allah, has died because of them, and a healthy one perished.' Azza entered upon Umm al-Banin, sister of Umar bin Abdul Aziz, who was a worshiper. She said to her, 'What is the meaning of Kuthayyir's saying: \"Every debtor paid his creditor... and Azza is procrastinating, her creditor is suffering.\" What was this debt?' She said, 'I promised him a kiss and I deferred it.' Then she [Umm al-Banin] went out from her [presence] and said, 'Fulfill it, and the sin be upon me.' Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Abi Mulaykah narrated from his father from his grandfather, saying: Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Ammar, who was then the Faqih of Hijaz, entered upon a slave trader displaying slave girls. He fell in love with one of them and became famous for it, to the point that Ata, Tawus, and Mujahid walked to him advising him. His answer was: 'People I sit with blame me regarding you... I do not care if the blame flies or lands.' His news reached Abdullah bin Ja'far, who had no concern other than him. He sent to the master of the slave girl and bought her from him for forty thousand dirhams, and ordered the keeper of his slave girls to perfume her, which she did. People entered upon him. He said, 'Why do I not see Ibn Abi Ammar?' He was told he was secluded in his home due to his excessive state. Ibn Ja'far went to him. When he saw him, he wanted to rise, but he made him sit and said to him, 'What has the love of So-and-so done?' He said, 'It is in the flesh, blood, nerves, and bones.' He said, 'Would you recognize her if you saw her?' He said, 'Would I recognize anyone else?' He said, 'We have added one to her; by Allah, I have not looked at her.' He ordered her, and she came out to him immediately. He said, 'Is this her?' He said, 'Yes, may my father and mother be your ransom.' He said, 'Take her by her hand, for I have made her yours. Are you satisfied?' He said, 'Yes, by Allah, and above satisfaction.' Ibn Ja'far said to him, 'But by Allah, I am not satisfied to give her to you like this. Boy, carry one hundred thousand dirhams to him.' \n\nChapter Seventeen: Mentioning the Cure for the Illness of Passion. \nI say: We have dedicated this chapter to mentioning the cure of love which has baffled the physicians, leaving them bewildered and drunk, though not from wine. However, what they agreed upon and pointed to is that there is no cure for this incurable disease except sweet union, such as pressing the breasts, knocking the lips, and the adhesion of bodies. [Poetry]: 'I saw that love has no cure... except placing chests upon chests.' Especially from one whose breasts have appeared, cheeks have rosed, taste is sweet, and embrace is good. 'I embrace him while the soul is still longing... for him; is there closeness after embrace? And I kiss his mouth so my heat may cease... but the bewilderment I encounter intensifies. As if my heart's thirst is not quenched... except by seeing the two spirits mix.' Another said: 'The cure of love is kissing and smelling... and placing bellies upon bellies. And a shaking from which eyes shed tears... and taking by the shoulders and the horns (locks of hair).' Another said: 'He sickened my heart then did not cure it... a tier of a belt (zunnar) on his waist. My spirit does not meet with his body... until I see my chest upon his belly.' Abu Ja'far al-Adawi said: 'The drunkenness of passion is more healing for my bones and joints... when the drinking companion gets drunk from the pleasure of wine. And better than the strumming of the second strings and plucking them... is the return of the voice of the mouth knocking against the mouth.' Abu Dihqan said: Abu Hilal our Sheikh narrated to us from some of his Sheikhs from Sharik: 'The lover is not cured of what ails him... by smelling and kissing until...' And in 'Al-Aghani', Abu al-Ayna said: I recited to Abu al-Ibar the saying of Al-Mamun: 'Love is nothing but a kiss... and a squeeze of a hand or a bite. And whoever's love is not like that... seeks only children. Love is nothing but this... if love is copulated with, it spoils.'",

    "text": "Then he said: Al-Ma'mun lied and ate … two and a quarter pounds by weight, and erred and behaved poorly. Why didn’t he say as I did: 'And love overflowed in my heart … woe if it hatches, love will not benefit me … if I do not break the obstruction, and if it does not remove the bald spot … then push it away from the kitchen.' Then he asked me what I thought, and I said, 'I am amazed.' He said: 'I thought you would say something else.' I raised my hand and said: 'Say what Al-Ma'mun said: if love marries, it spoils.' This is according to those who hold this view. Al-Marzubani narrated that a Bedouin said: 'I was involved with a woman I used to visit. Nothing between us caused suspicion, except that I saw the whiteness of her hand on a dark night, so I placed my hand over hers. She said: \"Do not ruin what is solid, for only marrying love spoils it.\"' It was narrated from some literati that a man loved a slave girl. She said: 'You have true love with full fidelity?' He said yes. She said: 'Go with me wherever you wish.' When he took her to his house, his only concern was to lift her legs and engage her with all his parts. She said to him while restrained: 'Divert your desire … and consider … the benefit … be gentle, for gentleness is praised.' He responded while in the act: 'I do not … the remaining affection … but this … is effort.' She pulled away and said: 'O sinner, you contradict your words. It seems you make my body the reason for the disappearance of your love. By God, I will never unite with you again.' According to this view, love spoils if consummated, and some say love only stabilizes after intercourse, and that love increases with consummation, calling it the 'nail of love.' As it was said: 'Love does not satisfy two lovers who have not tasted … union, for it surpasses all pleasures.' Hedbah ibn al-Khashram said: 'By God, the wandering heart is not healed … by incantations or tying charms, and the story persists … if you are connected and attached.' Another said, referring to Atikah: 'In a glance, the desire is resolved. I want you for marriage … not for sight. If you were satisfied with …, this would be for the moon.' Zuhair ibn Muskan loved a slave girl and pursued her. When he managed to possess her, she found nothing satisfying, so she left and never returned. He wrote many poems about her, including: 'You speak, and I kissed you a thousand kisses … is that all you have besides kisses?' I told her: 'Love is preserved in the heart … through long wakefulness, the eyes overflow for it.' She said: 'By God, the joy of a youth … from love is in a heart that contradicts action.' As for 'marrying the phantom' (imaginary love), there was disagreement. Abu Tammam al-Tai said it does not spoil love, unlike real marriage. Others disagreed. Some, when approaching their beloved, limit themselves to sipping, maintaining chastity and fear of sin if the beloved is unlawful. As it was said: 'Perhaps the delight of one night you had … forbidden by its lawful counterpart.' Another said: 'May I pour in your visit … for your heart and eyes’ desires, not intending harm … long observation maintains purity, but sinful sight.' Another said: 'Take free women without suspicion … like Meccan gazelles; their pursuit is forbidden. They think gentle talk is licentiousness … and it prevents them from sin.' Scholars said that lust of the heart is intertwined with the pleasure of the eye and love of the self, unless love is forced, in which case desire and pleasure are in proportion to indulgence. When eye, heart, and self align with the beloved, love dominates and sexual desire diminishes. If the woman dislikes the man, the outcome is negative, as said: 'My love saw Saad without union … she said our rope is a rope of separation.' Some claimed that traveling heals those deprived of their beloved, as it was said: 'If you want to forget a lover … count the nights without them.' Another said: 'They claimed the lover grows weary with closeness … and distance cures longing.' However, proximity did not cure our pain … though being near home is better than being far away.",

    "text": "However, nearness of the house is not beneficial... If the one you desire possesses no affection.\nAnother said: They said the cure for love is a love that removes it... For another, or long persistence in abandonment.\nAnother said: I treated myself for Laila with Laila, from desire... Just as the drinker of wine treats himself with wine.\nAl-Hafiz Abu Abdullah Al-Bukhari mentioned in his history with his chain of narration that Muhammad bin Dawood made a ring and engraved two lines on it. The first: 'And We found no covenant for most of them.' The second: 'So do not let yourself perish over them in regret.' When he saw a man persisting in looking at youths, he would say to him: 'Read what is on the ring,' perhaps he would desist from that. And Allah knows best.\nShams al-Din Ibn al-Akfani said in his book 'Ghunyat al-Labib 'inda Ghaybat al-Tabib' (Sufficiency of the Intelligent in the Absence of the Doctor), the text of which is: If the lover drinks a decoction of wild rue (Harmal), he forgets the love. Likewise, Indian indigo, if he drinks four grains of it with water before the love takes firm hold, he forgets. Likewise, the stone found sometimes in the bellies of chickens, if thrown in water and the lover drinks it, he forgets; and likewise if it is hung upon him. Also, the Salwan stone (stone of solace) and rubbing it with milk. And whoever hangs the stork stone upon himself while in love will forget, and if he is sad, his sadness will vanish. And whoever is in love with a male and rolls in the resting place of a female mule, his love will vanish. End quote.\nNote: Treatment by intercourse is not permitted by Islamic law in any way if the beloved is someone whom it is not permissible to marry. As for treatment by embracing and kissing, if a cure is realized by it, it is analogous to treatment with wine according to those who permit it; rather, this is lighter than that, for drinking it is among the major sins, while this act is among the minor sins.\n\nA Prescription: Use kissing, embracing, and thin lips in a hall, an Iwan (arched hall), with a pool and a fountain, food of seven colors, violet, narcissus, myrtle, wallflower, roses, basil, jars of old wine, a thousand dinars in a bag, and a slave girl from the children of the Turks with a plump leg and a kohl-rimmed eye. Use these needs on a red leather mat with green engravings. After this, enter the bathhouse, for it is tested and effective. Farewell.\n\nAnother Prescription: Take three weights (Mithqals) of the pure union of the beloved, a weight of the sticks of aversion and fear of the watcher, three weights of the kernels of meeting cleaned of the chaff of abandonment and interruption, an ounce of pure affection and concealment stripped of the sticks of repulsion and desertion. Take the perfume of incense, the kissing of mouths, and the embracing of waists, two weights of each. Take one hundred pomegranate-like kisses, rubbed and bruised; fifty of them small and sugary, thirty pigeon-style, and twenty sparrow-style. Take Aleppo coquetry and Iraqi snorting, two weights of each. Take two ounces of tongue-sucking and kissing the mouth with the lips. Pound everything, mix it, and sprinkle over it the weight of three Dirhams of Egyptian lust, adding to it the beauty of folded belly creases. Boil everything with the water of love over the syrup of intimacy and the firewood of mirth in the cauldron of haste. Strain everything over a Damascene Royal cloth, and dissolve in it two ounces of the syrup of satisfaction. Drink it on an empty stomach for three days. The diet should be a broth of the gourd of longing, adding to it the heart of the almond of embracing and the juice of the lemon of agreement. After that, consume three pounds (Ratls) of wine, followed by two pounds of leg-lifting, and enter the bathhouse. For it is beneficial. Farewell.\n\nA cutting sword and a shining, bright lightning regarding the treatment of the illness of passion: This is what the masters of mathematics recounted regarding the number 284. It is called the Lover Number, and its form in the natural pen (notation) is this. Its dot letters are D, F, R. In numbers, the Beloved is called 220, and its form in the natural pen is this.",

    "text": "And its dot letters are K, R. The number 220 is loved forever by the number 284. If a person has a ring or a silver tablet or whatever is possible of metals weighing 220, and another person has a second ring or tablet weighing the second of the two numbers, then the one who has 284 will love the one who has the number 220. If you want to solicit affection, attract hearts, and capture souls, write on a piece of paper the image of the numbers 284 in the natural pen described previously, and write on another piece of paper the image of the numbers 220. Hold the two papers between those who have hated each other, and they will love each other, and there will be no evil between them as long as the two papers are with them. If that is not possible, cast the two papers in a clean container, write the name of each of them or their famous title, and place the container in a place they pass over; they will love each other. If you write the loving numbers with water and sugar and give it to both of them to drink, they will love each other. More amazing than that is if you feed a person who has hated another 284 pomegranate seeds, and feed the other hated person at that very time 220 pomegranate seeds, they will love each other.\nAmong what confirms love, as some wise men mentioned, is that if moisture from the saliva of each of the lovers reaches the stomach of the other, that mixes with the whole body and reaches the mass of the liver. Likewise, if each of them breathes into the face of his companion, something exits from that breath and mixes with the particles of the air. If they inhale it, it enters the nostrils and some of it reaches the brain, flowing in it like the flow of sleep in the mass of the heart. Some of it reaches the lungs, then the heart, then creeps into the pulsing veins in the entire body. Thus, what dissolved from the body of this one knots in the body of that one, becoming a temperament (mixture), so passionate love is generated and love is confirmed. Sheikh Mughlatay said: This is what I incline towards; it is likely to last and remain, unchanged by the passing of nights. 'At the time of the test, a person is honored or humiliated.'\n\nSection",

    "text": "The Jurists differed on whether it is obligatory for a husband to have intercourse with his wife. A group said: It is not obligatory upon him because it is his right; if he wishes, he exacts it, and if he wishes, he leaves it, like one who rents a house—if he wishes he lives in it, and if he wishes he leaves it. This is one of the weakest opinions because the Quran, the Sunnah, custom, and analogy refute it. Allah Almighty said: \"And they (women) have rights similar to those against them in a just manner.\" If intercourse is the husband's right over her, then it is her right over the husband by the text of the Quran. Allah Almighty said: \"And live with them in kindness.\" It is contrary to kindness that he has a young woman whose desire equals his desire or exceeds it manifold, and he does not make her taste the pleasure of intercourse even once. Whoever claims that this is from kindness, his own nature suffices in refuting him.\nA group said: It is obligatory for him to have intercourse with her once every four months. The woman is given the choice after that: if she wishes, she stays with him, and if she wishes, she leaves him. Had she had a right to intercourse more than that, the husband would not have been allowed to leave it for that period. This is the more appropriate of the two opinions, despite what is in it.\nA group said: It is obligatory for him to have intercourse with her according to kindness (Ma'ruf), just as he spends on her, clothes her, and lives with her in kindness. They said: He must satisfy her with intercourse if he is able, just as he must satisfy her with food. Ibn Taymiyyah used to prefer this opinion and choose it. His student Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, urged the use of this, encouraged it, attached reward to it, and made it a charity for the doer. He said: \"And in the sexual act of one of you is a charity.\" In this is the perfection of pleasure, the perfection of benevolence, the attainment of reward, the joy of the soul, the departure of its bad thoughts, the lightness of the spirit and the departure of its density and coarseness, the lightness of the body, the balance of temperament, the bringing of health, and the repelling of bad substances.\nIf that coincides with a beautiful face, a gentle—meaning easy—character, abundant love, complete desire, and seeking reward, then that is the pleasure which nothing equals, especially if it meets its perfection. For it is not complete until every part of the body takes its share of pleasure. The eye finds pleasure in looking at the beloved, the ear in hearing his speech, the nose in smelling his scent, the mouth in kissing him, and the hand in touching him. Every limb devotes itself to what it seeks of its pleasures, and the beloved meets him with the like of that. If anything of that is missing, the soul remains looking forward to it, demanding it, so it does not settle completely. Therefore, the woman is called a \"Sakan\" (dwelling/peace) because the soul finds peace in her. For this reason, daytime intercourse was preferred over nighttime intercourse. It has another natural reason, which is that the night is a time when the senses cool down and seek their share of rest, while the day is the locus of the spreading of movements. That is His Almighty's saying: \"And it is He who has made the night for you as clothing and sleep [a means for] rest and has made the day a resurrection.\"\nMuhammad bin al-Munkadir used to pray in his prayer saying: \"O Allah, strengthen my penis for me, for in it is righteousness for my family.\" Abdullah bin Salih said: Al-Layth bin Sa'd, when he covered his family (had intercourse), used to say: \"O Allah, tighten its root for me, raise its chest for me, make easy its entry and exit, grant me its pleasure, and grant me righteous offspring who fight in Your way.\" He said: He was loud-voiced, so that was heard from him. Ali bin Asim said: Khalid al-Hadhdha' told us: When Allah created Adam and created Eve, He said: \"O Adam, find peace in your wife.\" Eve said: \"O Adam, how sweet this is! Increase us of it.\"\n\nChapter Eighteen: The Obstinacy of the Beloved against the Yearning Lover, and other divisions of Abandonment and the patience of the one holding onto embers in it.\nI say: We established this chapter to mention accusation and the beloved saying \"Away with you.\" It is a chapter, for one whom it passes, sweet to taste, fragrant in character by agreement. Its taste is known only to one who has tasted it and known the union of the beloved and his separation. Lovers have never ceased finding the beloved's accusation sweet, saying: \"The beloved's hitting is raisins... The condition of love among the masters of passion is that the beautiful one is loved for his accusation.\" No limit deters them, nor do they stop at a limit from the swords of glances. How often they saw the beloved's injustice as justice, and said to his cheek when it approached: \"Welcome and hello.\" No blamer's blame takes hold of them regarding him, nor do they count the injustice of the cold tyrant among injustices: \"Whoever does not taste the injustice of the beloved like his shadow... Sweet, has been ignorant of love and made a false claim.\"\nThe famous standard in this chapter is the saying of 'Ulayya bint al-Mahdi: \"Love was molded upon injustice, so if... The beloved were fair in it, it would be ugly. In the law of passion, it is not deemed good... For a lover to be good at composing arguments.\" It is as if she went in the first verse to the saying of Al-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf: \"The best days of passion are your day in which... You are frightened by abandonment and admonition. If there is no anger nor satisfaction in love... Then where is the sweetness of letters and books?\"\nAl-Numayri added to this, saying: \"My comfort is in the speech of the blamers. And my cure is in their saying: Do not exaggerate. Passion is not pleasant nor is love good for a lover... Except with five qualities:",

    "text": "Hearing harm, the blame of an adviser... Admonition, a secret enemy, and procrastination.\"\nJamil bin Ma'mar said: \"There is no good in love that stops, moved not by... The obstacles of despair, nor relaxed by greed. If I had her patience or the ability to swallow (grief) she has... I would possess what I bring and what I leave.\"\nAmong the most eloquent things said regarding the obstinacy of loved ones is the saying of a Bedouin regarding his beloved: \"I complained, so you said: All this is out of boredom... With my love? May Allah relieve your heart of my love. When I concealed the passion, she said obstinately... You were patient, and this is not the act of a grief-stricken heart. I draw near so she distances me, so I move away seeking... Her satisfaction, but she counts distancing as my sin. So my complaint hurts her, or my patience displeases her... And she panics at my distance and flees from my nearness. O people, is there a trick you know?... Advise (me) with it and merit the reward from my Lord.\"\nThey divided Abandonment (Hajr) into four types. They said: Abandonment of Coquetry (Dalal), Abandonment of Boredom (Malal), Abandonment as a penalty for a sin, and Abandonment necessitated by hatred established in the chests.\nAs for the Abandonment of Coquetry, it is much more delicious than Union. Upon it I established this chapter. Kushajim said: \"Were it not for the chase of the prey, there would be no pleasure... So prolong the chase for me with union a little. This drink is the brother of life, and it has no... Pleasure until it hits a burning thirst.\"\nAl-Mutanabbi said: \"The sweetest passion is what its owner doubts regarding union... And in abandonment, for he is forever feared and guarded against.\" He also said: \"Increase my soul in harm, I will increase you in love... For the most ignorant of people is a hateful lover.\" Another said: \"If it grieved me that you attained me with an offense... It surely pleased me that I crossed your mind.\"\nIt is recommended for one marked with beauty, capturing the hearts of women and men, to be very humble and little in self-debasement. Ibn Waki' said: \"They said: You loved one of much arrogance, inaccessible... I said: Far from it! The best of him is absent from you. If he were generous, he would be easy and his callers would be few... But he is mighty only because his demand is mighty.\" If he debases himself and answers everyone who calls him, he becomes subject to suspicions because the free soul is not detached from jealousy. Al-Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf said: \"O people, I did not abandon you out of boredom... From me, nor due to the speech of an envious slanderer. But I tested you and found you... Not patient with a single food.\"\nAs for the Abandonment of Boredom, the passing of days and nights dampens it, either by the distance of the abode or by the length of testing. It is told that Mutayyam al-Hashimiyyah, when Ali bin Hisham bought her, became favored by him and he loved her intensely. It happened that she got angry at him at one time and persisted in her anger. He tried to please her but she was not pleased. So he wrote to her: \"Coquetry calls to boredom. Many an abandonment called for patience. The heart (Qalb) was named Qalb only for its turning (Taqallub). The saying of Al-Abbas bin al-Ahnaf has proven true to me: 'I do not see myself but that I will abandon whoever does not... See me capable of abandonment when he bores of me. And I protect myself with good brotherhood against... The most harmful thing brotherhood brings to a human.'\" When she read the note, she went out to him immediately and was pleased.\nAs for the Abandonment generated by a sin, repentance removes it from the heart upon confession of the sin, especially if the beloved is: \"His kingdom is a kingdom of mercy, in which there is no... Tyranny from him nor arrogance. He fears Allah regarding the lover, and successful is he... Whose concern is piety (Taqwa).\"\nAs for the Abandonment necessitated by natural hatred, it is the one that has no cure. Al-Husri said: This is not valid between those of sincerity and those of distinction, since the reality of resemblance prevents it and the validity of suitability repels it. What I say also is that this type is a disease whose cure is impossible and whose bitter water is not sweet. The beloved in it is not to be blamed, and loving him is like one who dances in the dark and greets one who does not return the greeting: \"His loved ones, how much they do to his heart... What his enemies do not do to him.\" Al-Arjani took it and said: \"O our loved ones, you did not wound with your abandonment... A heart that spends the eternity saddened by worry. If you wanted my killing while you are loved ones... Then there is no difference between loved ones and enemies.\" Another said: \"My heart demands you of me every hour... If the debtor goes bankrupt, the creditor persists. It yearns for you with the yearning of one touched by thirst... While the watering places have been unjustly forbidden to him. If you wanted my killing while you are loved ones... Then the enemies are one with the beloveds.\"\n\nChapter Nineteen: Supplication against the Beloved, and the Inverted Jurisprudence therein.\nLike my saying: \"I prayed against the beloved due to the love of a fawn... From whom I endure types of harshness. So He united him (with me) and he exaggerated in turning away from me... So my prayer was, therefore, against myself.\"\nI say: We established this chapter to mention one who neared the arrival of his grave and wanted to pray against his soul (beloved), so he prayed against himself. He desires and complains, seeks cure and gets hurt. He does not remain firm on a state, nor does he distinguish with the sword of the glance between the past and the present. While he complains about his beloved, behold he complains to him; and while he prays for him, behold he prays against him. Among the best said in supplication for the beloved is the saying of our compatriot Muhammad bin al-Afif al-Tilimsani, may Allah have mercy on his youth and make the sealed nectar his drink: \"May Allah strengthen the supporters of the eyes... And perpetuate the rule of those eyelids. And they lost power due to languor... Even if they weakened my mind and religion. And may He protect the veil of those front teeth... Even if they turned the heart to sorrows. And may He extend the shade of that hair one day... Over the slender branches of his stature. And perpetuate the state of the sides (curves) within us... Even if they acted unjustly against the stabbed heart.\"\nAnd his saying also: \"May Allah perpetuate the days of union... And make eternal the life of those nights. And extend the shade of the branches of leisure... And increase the statures in good moderation. May the fruits of intimacy therein not cease... To increase in subtlety in every state. And may eyes not cease for us therein... Flirting with the eyes of the gazelle's fawn.\"\nAla' al-Din Ali bin al-Muzaffar al-Kindi said: \"May Allah perpetuate the days of the cheek-hair... And bless its short nights. And may Allah enrich the garden of every cheek... When it shies away from the heavy rains. And may the smiling places of every mouth not cease... To be smiling for the one observing its lightning. And may the trailing robes of shame not cease to cover lovers... In the casting off of restraint.\"\nIbn Abi al-Hadid said: \"May the right hands of all creation not embrace you... And may your waistband not tie. No, nor may your saliva be sipped after what... I tasted from your mouth, except by your mouth.\"\nAnother said: \"O Lord, if You decreed him for a kisser... Other than me, then let it be the toothstick or the cups. And if You judged for us the company of a third... O Lord, let it be a candle in the gathering. And if You judged for us the eye of a watcher... O Lord, let it be from the eyes of the narcissus.\"\nAmong the best said in supplication against the beloved is the saying of Shihab al-Din bin Ghanim: \"By Allah, I do not pray against the one abandoning me... Except that he goes deep into love until... He sees the extent of what happened... From him and what was done regarding my right.\"\nAnother said: \"O you who every day... Increases my mind in insanity. You bewildered me regarding him until... You returned my guidance to error. I pray against you while my heart... Says: O Lord, no, no.\"\nAnother said, and excelled as he wished: \"I said: You blamed until... I see you in love like me. But I said in secret within me... No, O Lord, do not answer me.\"\nAnother said: \"O you who turns away... From my address and my answer. The loss! May Allah not remove my life... Or He shows me in you what is in me. My Lord, make it a prayer... Disappointed, unanswered. My heart softened (fearing) to see... Your heart in the like of my torment.\"\nAnother said: \"O Lord, if there is no hope in his union... And no relief from the length of his cruelty. Then heal the illness that is in the glance of his eye... And cover the beauty of his cheeks with his beard.\"\nAnother said: \"How often he shunned me, so I intended to pray against him... But I stopped, then called out bewildered: May Allah not heal his glance from illness... And show me his cheek-hair while it is flowing.\"\nIbn Sana' al-Mulk said: \"I am captured by the length of my captivity in his hands... So he gets angry when I am captured by the length of my captivity. I asked Allah that he be afflicted with love... So he becomes a lover, but of my abandonment.\"\nIbn Waki' said: \"If you knew what is in me... While you do not care about me. And your heart became my heart... And you became in the like of my state. Nay, you lived in a good life... My soul and wealth ransom you. I prayed when my chest narrowed... Against you, then it appeared (better) to me.\"\nAnd his saying also: \"He understood a mistake from me, an understanding... He came to me asking about what he knew. Swearing that what I informed him of my illness... I am a liar, by Allah, in what he claimed. The oppressed is granted mercy from us... Then I do not pray against the one who wronged.\"",

Do you fear my prayer to the exclusion of this world? O Lord, do not hear him regarding it, even if... It was the prayer of the wandering lover.\"\nAnother said: \"I said to my beloved when his beloved passed by me... Like the moon travelling at night: This is the one whose glance takes for me... From your drowsy glance, revenge.\"\nAnother said: \"When it appeared to me that he is not visiting me... And that his desire is not clearing away from me. I wished that he loves someone else, perhaps... He endures the bitternesses of love so he softens for me.\"\n\nChapter Twenty: Submission and the Shedding of Tears\nI say: We established this chapter to mention one whose tear became poured upon poured, so he spent the night while it flowed like a spear (tube), as was said: 'Tube upon tube.' Especially if the abandonment persisted or there was some restriction upon him. There, lessons are seen from the pouring of his tear, and he recites when the mixture (companions) resolve to travel: \"And a separator from the dwelling of hearts... So the abodes were not empty of him. He sent the messenger and said to me... And I am the hearer, obedient to him: By Allah, tell me what flowed... After me? So I said to him: The tears.\"\nAnother said: \"The one I loved said to me, while separation was serious... And in my vitals was the flame of fire: What will you do in the road after me? I said: I will weep over you the length of the road.\"\nHow excellent is the saying of Judge Al-Fadil, may Allah have mercy on him: \"... I employed thoughts to travel at night... And you did not release for me a wage by union. And I did not see myself over the days except... I tied affection and untied a bundle (of money). And I did not ask the clouds of the eye for rain except I became with my tears in the sun a squeezed juice.\"\nAnd his saying also, which is from his prose that became scattered among the stars: \"So be patient until this flood clears, and the clouds of this drunkenness lift, and the handkerchiefs of the eyelids dry, for they have become a squeezed juice by tears. May Allah fight Separation! How great is its meddling by entering between lovers.\"\nIn this dazzling meaning, Ibn Abd al-Zahir says: \"Do not ask me about the beginning of Love, indeed I... Am in it old of abandonment (Hijr) and delirium (Hujrah). From my tears and from your forehead I wanted... My passion with a pouring rain and a blaze.\"\nAmong Al-Mutanabbi's strange meanings is his saying: \"Do you think she, due to the abundance of lovers... Thinks tears are a creation (natural part) in the tear-ducts?\"\nAnd his saying also: \"Do not blame the yearning one for his longings... Until your vitals are in his vitals. Indeed the wick dyed with its tears... Is like the slain dyed with his blood.\"\nAnd his saying also: \"I gifted consolation to the one who blamed me... And spent the night occupied by longing. As if the eyelids upon my eye... Are clothes torn over a bereaved mother.\"\nThe saying of another: \"The hand of sorrow tore upon him... The robe of tears down to the hems.\"\nAnother said regarding Submission and Shedding Tears: \"And I did not forget, I will not forget that submission... And the overflow of tears and the squeezing of the hand. And my cheek added to her cheek... Standing until the morning, we did not sleep.\"\nIbrahim bin al-Mi'mar said: \"And I have an angry one whom nothing pleases except... Tears pouring continuously. So his sides did not bend with union... While there was a drop in my eye after abandonment.\"\nAnother said: \"A female sayer: What is the matter with your eyes since they saw... The beauties of this person, their tears are pouring? I said: My eye committed adultery by looking at a countenance... So it had a right, from the flood of its tears, to a Ghusl (ritual washing).\"\nAl-Sari al-Raffa' said: \"My soul be the ransom of one who returned the greeting laughing... So he renewed a greed for union after despair. And the tears of the eye came between me and him... As if the tears of the eye love him with me.\"\nIbn Waki' said: \"And a cloud, when the water poured in it... The thunder ignited the lightning in its vitals. Like the water of the eyes, it did not flow except... It kept fueling the fire upon the hearts.\"\nI said from a Hijazi poem: \"O my two friends, the garden of Al-Raqmatayn, its embroidery... If the Hijazi lightning flashes, is gilded. So do not wonder at the clouds of my tear if they poured... For not every lightning that appeared to the eye is deceiving.\"\nI said from another Hijazi poem: \"My ulcerated eyelid upon the cheeks has dripped... So suffice it what flowed from my tears, suffice. If the arrangement of my tears is difficult when I scatter... For pearls are what is difficult until it passes the oyster shell.\"",

So I resembled in my tear its solid rock (Al-Khansa' - also poetess famous for weeping). You dared, O my tear, but did not dare always... So O tear, how flowing! And O heart, how hard!\"\nI also said from a poem: \"Indeed my eye upon Al-Aqiq, if... My tear did not resemble in its color a red (wine). Since the silver of my tear became gold... Alchemy became valid for me for my eye. Do not ask what flowed of tears when... It became boldness against my blamer. The night brought forth my tears upon my cheek...

And if my glance untied its water-skin strap with tears... Then the breast of the one whom my glance greeted is tying.\"\nI said from a poem: \"I watered with the sea of tears the cold of her land...

From the long life of my weeping.\"\nAnother said: \"A female sayer: Why is your tear white... I said to her: O high one, this is what remained. Did you not know that weeping, its life prolonged... So my tears turned grey just as my hair turned grey? And soon neither my tears nor my blood... Will be seen, but my anguish and burning.\"\nAnother said: \"A female sayer: Why is your tear black... While it used to be white and you are emaciated? I said to her: My tears dried up from weeping... And this is the black of the eye flowing.\"\nAnother said: \"My tears were red on the day of their separation... But since they distanced, I bleached them after them with burning. I picked with the glance roses from their cheeks... So separation distilled rose water from my pupils.\"\nAl-Nashi' Al-Akbar said: \"She wept for the separation, and startled me... The weeping of the beloved for the loss of the abode. As if the tears on her cheek... Are the remains of dew on a pomegranate blossom.\"\n\nChapter Twenty-One: Promises and Wishes, and what relief of meanings is in them.\nI say: We established this chapter to mention the wishes which are inevitable and indispensable, so there is no less than them: \"I distract my heart with wishes, perhaps... I relieve the worry from myself with wishes. And I know that your union is not hoped for... But there is no less than wishing.\"\nLovers have never ceased distracting themselves with wishes and filling their cups with the wine of their palm/comfort. Among them are those who won the wish before the arrival of death. And among them are those who died with the greatest choking grief, and the beloved did not fall to him on a story: \"Whoever attained a wish from his world... The days dropped the Alif from it (Muna -> Maniyya/Death).\"\nThis last type is numerous, and the one sick with it among lovers is a large multitude: \"He whose pasture of determination and worries is... The garden of wishes ceases not to be emaciated.\"\nYes, among them are those who spent the night robbed of sleep by the beloved's promise, far from meeting death on an appointment: He believes the beloved's saying and disbelieves it, tests him and tries him, and says: \"I am still waiting for your promise, my lady... In the house, turning towards the knocking of the door. O liar whose promise is with his tongue... Who is for me with some of your lying tongue?\"",

    "text": "How often he despaired of the beloved's promise, and held on from seeing his leg to the promises of 'Urqub, as was said: \"And the attainment of wishes in their promises... Is but like Ash'ab hoping for the promise of 'Urqub.\"\nNote: Their saying in the proverb \"Promises of 'Urqub\" is said to one who made a promise and broke it. The origin of the mentioned proverb is that 'Urqub had a brother who asked him for something. 'Urqub said to him: \"When my palm tree pollinates.\" When it pollinated, he said: \"When it becomes small green dates (Balah).\" When it became Balah, he said: \"When it becomes colored dates (Zaha).\" When it became Zaha, he said: \"When it becomes fresh ripe dates (Rutab).\" When it became Rutab, he said: \"When it becomes dried dates (Tamr).\" When it became Tamr, he took it at night and gave his brother nothing. So it became a proverb for breaking promises, so it was said \"Promises of 'Urqub.\"\nAl-Shammakh said: \"And she promised me what I do not try to benefit from... The promises of 'Urqub to his brother in Yathrib.\"\nIbn Hajjaj said: \"I ransom one who met me just as... I met him, and the truth is not difficult. I said: O 'Urqub, you gave me hope... He said: Why do you tire yourself, O Ash'ab?\"\nI said from a Hijazi poem: \"He threatens me with abandonment every night... I believe his union in it and disbelieve. When we arrived at the water of Madyan, he said to me: By the right of Shu'ayb, you are Ash'ab in love.\"\nPeople are of two opinions regarding wishes: Among them are those who see the comfort of their heart and the venting of their distress, so they comfort the soul with them and hang on from their light to the ropes of the sun. And among them are those who say: \"Hoping is not what saves...\" So he sees wishes as deception and falling into conflict. Each of the two opinions has proof and a school of thought with a traveled path.\nAmong the best I heard in the first opinion is the saying of some of Banu al-Harith: \"Wishes from Su'da are beautiful, as if... Su'da watered us with them, upon thirst, cold water. Wishes, if they inhabit truly, are the best wishes... Otherwise, we have lived by them for a time in comfort.\"\nAnd the saying of the other: \"And when we settled in a dwelling bedewed by moisture... Elegant, and a garden adorned with blossoms. The pleasantness of the place and its beauty created for us... A wish, so we wished, and you were the wishes.\"\nPlato said: \"Wishes are the dream of the awake and the solace of the sad.\" Another said: \"Wishes are a comforting companion; if they do not benefit you, they have distracted you.\" A Bedouin was asked: \"What is the most enjoyable of worldly pleasures?\" He said: \"Joking with the beloved, conversing with the friend, and wishes by which you cut your days.\"\nJudge Al-Fadil said, and excelled as he wished: \"I found the scent of his letters and the spirit of his nearness, so we returned to the habit, and our days returned, and we proceeded to the best, and our speech softened, and wishes returned to us. They almost did not occur, and if they occurred, they were but speech of us: 'I wish for those illuminating nights... And the effort of the lover is to wish.'\"\nYaqut al-Rumi said: \"By Allah, days passed with you... How sweet and pleasant they were! They passed and nothing remained for us after them... Except that we wish for them.\"\nSheikh Fath al-Din bin Sayyid al-Nas said: \"I yearn for the Ban tree from which my abandoning one departed... Distracting myself with the nights of her union in it. An age passed and the robes of youth were new... Nothing remained of its goodness except wishing for it.\"\nAl-Afif said: Is the scribe of construction for Al-Nasir Dawood worthy? \"Were it not for promises of hopes I live by... I would have died, O people of this tribe, long ago. But the gaze of my hopes is cheerful in it... Running with the promise of wishes, loose of rein.\"\nIbn Khafaja said: \"And a night, when I said it has parted and ended... It revealed a promise from false thought. I do not forget but that I laugh for an hour... At the mouths of wishes in the faces of demands. I thought the darknesses in it were black braids... Having the neck of hopes, white of upper chests.\"\nAnother said: \"In wishes is comfort, even if she distracted us... Regarding her love with some of what will not be.\"\nI said: \"Be gentle with a lover who became, due to what he struggles with... Of his pouring tear running in its streams. Nothing remained in him but a spirit he repeats... Were it not for wishes, he would have died, O furthest of his wishes.\"\nI also said: \"O good scent that traveled from towards them at dawn...

I do not see a cure for the disease of my passion in air.\"\nIbn Zaydun said: \"I will surely graze my eyes... In that fresh garden. And I will eat you with wishes... And I will drink you with the conscience.\"\nAnother said: \"Distract me with a promise... And procrastinate as long as I live with it. And let me win from you... A secret talk asking for it.

He had a jar with milk in it, and he was saying wishfully: \"I will sell this milk for such and such, and buy such, then sell it and gain such and such in it. My wealth will increase and my condition will improve. I will propose to Al-Hajjaj's daughter and marry her. She will bear me a son. I will enter upon her one day and she will quarrel with me, so I will strike her with my foot like this.\" He kicked with his foot, broke the jar, and the milk spilled. Al-Hajjaj knocked on the door. He opened for him. He lashed him fifty times and said: \"Is it not so that if you kicked my daughter like this, you would have pained me regarding her?\"\nAli bin Ubaydah said: \"Wishes are the signs of ignorance.\" Another said: \"Wishes deceive you and at the realities leave you.\"\nIt happened that Al-Zaki Abd al-Rahman al-Qusi attended the gathering of Al-Malik Al-Muzaffar before he governed Hama and recited to him: \"When will I see you and the one you desire while you are as... You desire, despite them, two spirits in a body? There he recited while hopes were present... Congratulations on the kingdom, the loved ones, and the homeland.\" Al-Malik Al-Muzaffar promised him that if he possessed Hama, he would give him a thousand dinars. When he possessed it, he recited to him: \"My master, this kingdom, you have attained it... Despite creatures, from the Creator. And time is submissive to what you wished... So this is the time of the truthful promise.\" He signed for him a thousand dinars. He stayed with him, and travels became necessary for him, so he spent the money he gave him in them and did not acquire an increase over it. So he said: \"That which they gave me as a lump sum... They have taken back little by little. Would that they had not given and not taken... And Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs.\" That reached Al-Muzaffar, so he expelled him from a house he had lodged him in. He said: \"Do you expel me from the break of a dilapidated house... While I have regarding you houses of good praise? For if I live, I will not lack a place to contain me... And if I die, you know the mention of whom will die.\" So Al-Muzaffar imprisoned him. He said: \"What is my sin against you?\" He said: \"Your saying 'Allah is sufficient for me, and He is the best Disposer of affairs'.\" So he ordered him strangled. When he sensed that, he said: \"You gave me the thousand out of honor and generosity, I wonder, or did you give me my blood money?\" I said: The Sultan was faulted for his malice against him because of his saying \"Allah is sufficient for me and He is the best Disposer of affairs\" until he killed him. There is no power nor strength except in Allah the Most High, the Great. His state with him was as was said: \"So I was like one wishing to see a dawn... Of the morning; when he saw it, he went blind.\" And the one who said: \"And perhaps one from whom a youth hopes for a youth's benefit... His fear is more fitting for him than his hope. Many a one through whom you hope to repel harm... Harm will come to you from before him.\"\nI mentioned here the saying of the other: \"When the cloud (cheek-hair) appeared on his cheek... I brought glad tidings to my heart of the enduring bliss. And I said: This is a cloud raining... But therein came to me the painful punishment.\"\nIbn Sana' al-Mulk said from a letter: \"The beloved! You are the one who shook me off his hand and rejected me from his mind. You are the one who weaned me before the union completed its term of pregnancy and weaning. You are the one who broke to me what you promised me... And made those who blamed regarding you gloat over me.",

    "text": "Perhaps an eye (evil eye) hit us, so it did not look... Or a slanderer said lies between us. Perhaps your admonition has praiseworthy consequences... And perhaps bodies become healthy by illnesses. Perhaps satisfaction from you—and how is its attainment?... Pleases a heart your abandonment offended. Perhaps a thirst in the soul quenches its burning... And an ember of passion in the heart extinguishes its fire. Perhaps an affection draws near to a hope... A heart confused between despair and greed. Perhaps the eye of satisfaction from the one I was tasked with... One day refutes what my enviers said. Perhaps a time that has turned away will bend back... To us, and a heart that has hardened will soften. Perhaps the tails of pardon—and pardon is wide... The harsh one drags them over the parting of the sin. Perhaps the forgetting of the heart returns... And this is a mistake; far be it from my heart to forget. Perhaps! And what does 'Perhaps' avail? It is but... The distraction of a lover and the rest of a wanderer. And there is no less than distracting oneself with 'Perhaps', and how little is its enrichment and how much is its trouble.\n\nChapter Twenty-Two: Satisfaction from the Beloved with the Easiest Request\nI say: We established this chapter to mention the printed lover and the content admirer, who is satisfied with the beloved by looking if he is present, and pleased with him by a greeting even once in a year. He is, in satisfaction with him, with the scant little, as was said: 'Your little cannot be called little. I am satisfied from you with the easiest thing... That a beloved is satisfied with from a lover. With a greeting on the road if... The road brings us together by chance.'\nAl-Ma'arri said: 'He met you in the year that passed and did not... Ask you except for a kiss in the coming (year). Indeed, the miser, if the duration extends for him... In generosity, the giving of the giver becomes easy for him.'\nJamil said: 'I turn my glance in the sky, perhaps... My glance agrees with his glance when he looks.' He also said: 'And I am satisfied from Buthayna with what... If the slanderer were certain of it, his anxieties would settle. With \"No\" and with \"I cannot\" and with wishes... And with the hoped-for hope whose hoper has failed. And with the hasty glance, and with the year passing... Its ends not meeting its beginnings.'\nI said: Look at this witty poet and chaste lover; he was content from the watering places of his loved ones with a trickle, and sufficed with the glance from the gaps of curtains and nets.\nOf this extracted meaning is the saying of Ibn al-Mu'tazz: 'Do I not see the star which is rising... Over her? This is beneficial for lovers. Perhaps my glance and her glance meet in the horizon... So it gathers us since there is no gatherer on earth.'\nThe famous standard in this chapter is the saying of a Bedouin: 'Does not the night gather Umm Amr... And us? So that is a nearness for us. Yes, and I see the crescent as she sees it... And the day rises over her as it rose over me.' Sheikh Athir al-Din Abu Hayyan used to say about the author of these two verses: 'This is the content lover.'\nAnother said: 'To the flying eagle (star) I look every night... For I am looking at it in the evening. Perhaps my glance and your glance meet at it... So we complain together of what the consciences hide.'\nSome Bedouin said: 'And I did not attain from her her union other than that I... If she urinated, I urinated where she urinates.'\nI mentioned here what is told about someone who saw a beautiful woman in a window and loved her. He stuck to standing at her door and passing under the window until he became weary, his patience decreased, and he attained despair of her. He knocked on her door. The slave girl came out to him. He gave her a bowl and said: 'Let your mistress urinate in this.' So she urinated for him in the bowl. She said to the slave girl: 'Follow him and see what he does with that.' She did not cease following him until he entered some ruins, put... in that urine, and said: 'O unlucky one, if you miss the meat, drink the broth.'\nIbn al-Jawzi narrated in the book 'Al-Adhkiya' (The Intelligent Ones) that the Hoopoe said to Solomon, peace be upon him: 'I want you to be in my hospitality.' Solomon said to him: 'Me alone?' He said to him: 'Rather, with the army on such island on such day.' So Solomon and his soldiers went there. The Hoopoe ascended to the sky, hunted a locust, strangled it, and threw it in the sea. He said: 'O Prophet of Allah, eat! For whoever missed the meat attained of the broth.' Solomon and his soldiers laughed at that for a full year. Some took this meaning and said: 'And be content, for a proverb has run... If you miss the meat, drink the broth.'\n\nChapter Twenty-Three: Mixing of Bodies/Forms, Mixing of Water with Wine",

    "text": "I say: We established this chapter to mention one who was excessive in embracing when leg wrapped around leg, so he and his beloved became like a single thing in the view of the eye, even to the cross-eyed who sees one thing as two. That is due to the excess of love whose owner's heart is not cured by union, nor do the ropes of his tears break by connection, as was said: 'And I almost, while he was my bedfellow, said to him... From the intensity of love: You have become distant, so draw near.'\nIbn al-Rumi said: 'I embrace him while the soul is still longing... For him; is there closeness after the embrace? And I kiss his mouth so my heat may vanish... But the wandering I suffer intensifies. And the amount of ardency in me was not such... That nothing but the two lips would cure it by sipping. As if my heart's thirst is not quenched... Except by seeing the two souls mix.'\nAnother said: 'I traveled to him while the darkness was as if it were... A victim of sleep, and the star in the horizon was a witness. Even if my soul mixed then with his soul... I would have said: Come near me, O distant one.'\nAbu al-Husayn al-Tunisi said: 'Then we embraced, so you see us together... In the darkness of the night and the light of admonition. Two bodies became in love one... Like two vowel marks mixed in a book.'\nKhalid the Scribe said: 'As if I embraced a basil plant... Breathing in its cold night. If you saw us in the shirt of darkness... You would have thought us in one body.'\nNiftawayh the Grammarian said: 'And when we met after distance in a gathering... In which eyes of fresh narcissus flirted. I made my reliance his hugging and embracing... So he did not separate until I imagined him part of me.'\nHow excellent is the saying of Abu Bakr al-Irbili: 'The watcher intended to strive for our separation... At night, while he spent the night embracing (me) out of desires. I embraced him so we united, and the watcher came... When he saw one, he turned away in anger.'\nSayf al-Din al-Mashad said: 'And when the one I love visited at night... And we feared that an observer would descend upon us. We embraced to hide him, so we became... As if we were one in a writer's knot.'\nAnother said: 'A slanderer imagined his visit was between us at night... So he intended to strive for distance between us. So I embraced him until we united in embrace... When he came to us, he saw only one.'\nChief Judge Kamal al-Din bin al-Adim said when he heard these two verses: 'He held him with the hold of a blind man.'\nAbu al-Fadl said: 'May a life that passed be watered, while time gathers us... And we resemble in embrace the shape of Tanwin (double vowel mark). So I became, when my palm hung onto your ropes... With the arrow of your abandonment you shoot (Tarmi) then intend (Tanwin - also means to make Nun sound).'\nSimilar to this saying in lack of safety and directing blame is the saying of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk: 'And a night we spent after my drunkenness and his drunkenness... I cast aside my pillow then pillowed him my hand. And between us, like one body from our embrace... Or like a letter in speech with Shadda (doubled).' If he had said 'like a letter in verse (Nizam)', he would not have fallen into blame, because the letter with Shadda in pronunciation is counted by prosodists as two letters, but in writing no. So according to this, what he wanted is not complete for him, even if he made his forearm for the beloved like the pillow. He has no excuse because the meter helped him and aided him in obtaining this benefit.\nSome poets of 'Al-Dhakhira' said: 'We spent the night behind the veil, covered by... A cloak of dignity, and the reunion gathered. Two, from the intensity of embracing, have... Become like an individual connected by the spirit. If the rain of the sky rained on us... Wetness would not hit the ground beneath us.'\nMuhammad bin 'Arus said: I met Ali bin al-Jahm in a ship while we did not know each other. We conversed and I found him sweet in conversation. In some of what he said was: 'I am the most poetic of people.' I said to him: 'With what?' He said: 'With my saying: Behold, many a night gathered us after a slumber... And brought a heart near to a tortured heart. So we spent the night together; if a bottle... Of wine were spilled between us, it would not have been drunk (soaked in).' I said to him: 'By Allah, you have done well, but I am more poetic than you.' He said: 'With what?' I said: 'With my saying: No, by the dwellings of Najd! And our night... Was restricted since our two bodies were a body between us. Slumber sought in us a place of subtle passage... One day, but neither a cheek nor an upper arm separated.' The origin of this is the saying of Bashar bin Burd, and it is of royal poetry: 'And one of shaking buttocks, slender waist... She moves with the magic of her eye and spins. If she looks, she pours upon you ardent love... And the hearts of lovers almost fly. I was alone with her; water could not pass between us... Until the morning, without me being a barrier and curtains.'\nI mentioned in my saying 'that in the beginning of the chapter (is) the cross-eyed who sees one thing as two' the saying of some Maghrebis regarding a handsome one having a cross-eyed watcher: 'By my father! A fawn possessing with beneficence... An ownership whose subject is human. Dark-lidded, having a cross-eyed watcher... The thing in his perception is two equal things. Would that he left what I am seeing... And he is the one chosen in the second gazelle.'\nIbn Isra'il said in a Dubayt (couplet): '... He exaggerated in his speech with lies, whoever said: I saw his like with the eye. His like is seen only by a cross-eyed one... From the aspect that he sees the one as two.'\nAnd the saying of Sadr al-Din bin al-Wakil: 'They say to me: Why are you fond of a cross-eyed one... Who inverts the two spouses (couplets)? I said to them: An excuse! Each eye saw the beauty of its sister's attributes... So it returned, through the length of time, looking at it askance.'\n\nChapter Twenty-Four: The Lover's Body becoming like a Toothpick (Khilal) and a Phantom of Imagination, and what carries that meaning regarding the slenderness of the beloved's waist and comparing the buttocks to a sand dune.\nI say: We established this chapter to mention one whom emaciation led to withering, so he became like the ruin among ruins. He is, from the intensity of harm, as Sarr-Durr said: 'And how many an emaciated one among those tents... You think him among its ropes.' So his beloved in aversion is one like the Alif, and he in his thinness is like the phantom walking backward. 'And when she saw me like the stick of a toothpick... And my body as the spider weaves. She said: You die, until when... So I said: I... until I die.'\nThe famous standard in this chapter is the saying of Al-Mutanabbi: 'Passion wore out my body with grief on the day of distance... And abandonment separated between the eyelid and slumber. A spirit repeated in the likeness of a toothpick, if... The wind blew the robe off him, he would not be seen. Enough of emaciation for my body is that I am a man... Were it not for my addressing you, you would not see me.'\nHe also said: 'And if a pen were thrown in the split of his head... From illness, it would not change the handwriting of a scribe.'\nHe also said: 'Until when is the greed of the blamer... While there is no opinion in love for the rational? It is desired from the heart to forget you... But natures refuse the transfer. And I love, of your love... My emaciation and every emaciated youth. Even if you ceased then I did not weep for you... I would weep for my vanished love.'\nAl-Mi'mar said: 'My yellowing and emaciation, both... In love, my body warns the lovers. So it is like an Alif in gold script... The darkness made me papers for it.'\nI said from a poem: 'As if the mist of the horizon is incense carried by... The breeze of the East from towards the land of loved ones. As if the echo between the mountains is a lover... And nothing remained of him but a voice and a moan.'\nAl-Mutanaqqil said: 'If slumber shunned me and joined a people... It has an excuse in staying behind me. Passion did not leave a figure in my body... So when slumber came to me, it did not find me.'\nIbn Lu'lu' said: 'And a phantom of a beloved kept me awake... His house was distant when he saw me. Due to my sleeplessness, he visits but I do not see him... And due to my illness, he circles but does not see me.'\nMuhyi al-Din bin Abd al-Zahir said: 'O hunter with the glance, and who... Is a hunter of other than mankind. Do not wish for the bird of my heart to flee... Indeed, it is within my ribs in a cage.'\nMudar al-Maghribi said: 'Love melted him until if you imagined him... With imagination, imagination would not be able to imagine him. Were it not for moaning and anguishes moving him... The one speaking to him would not know him by sight.'\nMahasin al-Shawwa said: 'I withered and the one I desire was stingy with union... And the phantom treated me as an enemy while it was a visitor. So I resembled that which is a decrease (Naqs) for illness... Even if connection (Silah) and obstacle (Arid) contradicted it.'\nAl-Arjani said: 'Were it not for her light, they would not have seen me from emaciation... Nor would they have become my adversaries for her sake. But she manifested like a shining sun... So I loomed through the light like dust particles.'\nAnother said: 'I had in the past a ring... My body became thin so I used it as a belt. And the illness increased in me so if I were thrust... Into the eye of a sleeper, he would not wake up.'\nAbu al-Atahiya said: 'Nothing remained but the little in me... And I do not think she will leave what remained.'\nAnother said:",

    "text": "I was alone with her, the water not flowing between us... until the morning, without a doorkeeper or curtains in my way. I mentioned in my speech that in the beginning of the section on 'States'—regarding one who sees one thing as two things—the saying of a Maghrebi poet about a beautiful one who had a cross-eyed observer. By my father, a gazelle who possesses, along with benevolence... a kingly quality whose subject is human. He has brown eyelids and a cross-eyed observer... The object in his perception is two equal things. Would that he left the one I am looking at... and he can choose the second gazelle. Ibn Israel said regarding a verse... where he exaggerated in his speech with lies: Who said 'I saw the likes of him' with the eye: None sees the likes of him except the cross-eyed... since he sees the one as like two.

He is, from the severity of harm, as Sarr-Durr said: How many a thin one among those tents... whom you would think was one of the tent ropes. So his beloved is unique in cruelty like the letter 'Alif', while he, in his thinness, is like a phantom walking backward. And when she saw me like the stick of a toothpick... and my body as if a spider weaves it; She said, 'You are dying,' to which... I said that I... until I die. The famous banner in this chapter is the saying of Al-Mutanabbi: Passion wore out my body in sorrow on the day of separation... and abandonment separated my eyelid from slumber. A spirit wandering in something like a toothpick; if... the wind blew the garment off him, he would not be visible. It is sufficient emaciation for my body that I am a man... were it not for my speaking to you, you would not see me. He also said: And if a pen were thrown into the split of his head... from sickness, it would not change the handwriting of a scribe. He also said: Until when is the greed of the censurer... and is there no opinion for the wise regarding love? It is desired of the heart to forget you... but nature refuses the transporter. And I adore, from your love... my emaciation, and every young man is emaciated. And if you ceased to exist and I did not weep for you... I would weep for my love that ceased. Al-Mi'mar said: He left my yellowing and emaciation, both of them... in love, my body warns the lovers. As if it is an 'Alif' in gilded script... The darkness made it the thinnest of papers. I said in a poem: As if the fog of the horizon is incense traveled by... the breeze of the east wind from the direction of the land of the loved ones. As if the echo between the mountains is a person enslaved by love... and nothing remains of him but a voice and a groan. Al-Munaqqil said: If slumber shunned me and connected with others... then it has an excuse for lagging behind me; Love did not leave a person in my body... so when slumber came to me, it did not find me. Ibn Lu'lu' said: A phantom of a beloved kept me awake... whose house was distant when he saw me. So from my wakefulness, he gathers but I do not see him... and from my sickness, he circumambulates but does not see me. Muhyiddin bin Abd al-Zahir said: Oh hunter with glances, and one who... is a predator to all mankind; Do not mark the bird of my heart for flight... for it is in a cage within my ribs. Mudar al-Maghribi said: Love melted him until, if you imagined him... with the imagination, the imagination would be incapable of conceiving him. Were it not for the groaning and pangs that move him... the one speaking to him would not know him by sight. Mahasin al-Shawwa said: I wasted away, and the one I desire was stingy with union... and the phantom visited me, acting as a visitor; So I resembled that which belongs to sickness as a decrease... even if a link and an obstacle contradicted it.

    "text": "'I saw lovers having bodies... Longing whittled them; if they were blown upon, they would fly.'\nIbn Abd Rabbihi said: 'And when my family saw my illness... Exceed its limit, the limit of the sick. I blocked the outlets of breezes from me... Fearing that I fly with the breeze.'\nAnother said: 'And if a visitor approached to speak to me... His breaths played with me in the bed.'\nAnother said: 'The hands of emaciation tampered with him so he is like... A hidden secret in a concealing conscience. Your love emaciated me, O my destroyer... And longing increased me so I was not known. And I melted until if passion threw me... Into the pupil of the beholder, he would not blink.'\nNasir al-Din al-Faq'asi said: 'My body says to my emaciation, while... Excess of illness and depression has exceeded in me: O illness, you have done to me what was not... By Allah, worn clothes upon.'\nFalling into this category is what poets described of the waist regarding slimness. Ibn Isra'il exaggerated in it where he said and spoke well: 'Alas for the slender waist! Only... His trusted speech cut the way. A waist upon which a wrist of a kiss was encircled... So it was as if my kissing it was an embrace.'\nSheikh Safi al-Din al-Hilli said: 'A handsome one whom the branch envies at its swaying... And the full moon is ashamed of at its rising. There is no deficient meaning in him except his waist... And there is nothing cold in him except his saliva.'\nI said: He took it from the saying of our compatriot Muhammad bin al-Afif al-Tilimsani, and wanted to restrict it to beauty, so he fell short. He ran behind him to stumble upon the meaning, but he did not stumble upon it, rather he stumbled. The difference between them is as between bitter water and Kawthar, and the waist and the little finger. Do you not see the saying of Ibn al-Afif and the sweetness of his witty logic: 'How much his waist withdraws while it is thin... And how sweet his saliva becomes while it is cold. And how much he claims protection while these eyelids of his... With their languor make promises to lovers.'\nHe also said: 'I complained to that Beauty of an ardent love... Which tasked my eyelid that it never sleeps. So the sides softened for me and the waist pitied me... But the hair and the transporter of the buttocks withdrew.'\nHe also said: 'The playing of hair on his buttocks... Dropped my heart into the long and wide (trouble). O buttock that dragged on his waist... Gently with it! You are but heavy.'\nMentioning the buttocks, how excellent is the saying of the other: 'The full moon has a spot from his cheek... And in the fawn is a listlessness from his glance. If he walks, his buttocks pull him... As if he walks backwards.'\nSheikh Safi al-Din al-Hilli said regarding a dancing handsome one: 'He came, and in his stature is moderation... Slender, having no equal. A north wind lightened his side... And wine made his eyelid heavy. Then he bent dancing with a stature... Toward which minds bent. He roams between us with a face... In which waters of modesty roam. And the dance swayed a side of him... By which subtleness and entry became light. So his side (waist) is inside, light... And his buttock is outside, heavy.'\nIbn Rashiq said: 'I carry my weights on his buttocks... And hold the waist lest it gets lost.'\nSheikh Jamal al-Din bin Nubata said: 'I asked the dune (Naqa) and the Ban tree resembling to my sight... Buttocks or sides of one whose repulsion was long. The gloomy sand said: I am not its load... And the Ban branch said: I am not its size.'\n\nChapter Twenty-Five: Mention of what Loved Ones endure of Difficult Matters, and other things they suffer of bearing hardships and the pain of separation.\nLike his saying: 'People before me complained of the pain of separation... And distance frightened the living and the dead. But the like of what my ribs enclosed... I have not heard nor seen.'\nI say: We established this chapter to mention what the lover measures of riding dangers in seeking desires. He ceases not to be busy with his state, turning under his loads, enduring in seeking the beloved terrors heavier than mountains, and being generous in exchange for a slight glance from him with soul and wealth.\nAl-Tughra'i said: 'And whoever seeks loved ones is more generous... With the sacrifice of the soul than Ka'b bin Mamah. And whoever seeks spoils does not fear him who... Drew his sword before his demand.'\nHe also said: 'I do not hate the wide stab followed... By a volley from the arrows of wide eyes. Nor do I fear the white blades aiding me... With a glance from the gaps of curtains and nets.'",

    "text": "Imam Muhammad bin Dawood al-Zahiri said: 'I carried mountains of love regarding you, while I am... Unable to carry the shirt and weak. Love is not from beauty nor from generosity... But it is something with which the soul is tasked.'\nThis last verse is like the saying of the other: 'How much beauty is in people, but... Upon you, for my misery, my choice fell.' This lover was fair for admitting that there are those more beautiful than his beloved, but the dominance of desire and the inclination of the soul dropped him into his love.\nAmong the best I heard regarding seeking desires and riding dangers is the saying of Ibn Khafaja: 'I traversed before the tribe every desert... In which the vulture of the sky circles over a nest. And I waded the darkness of the night, black as coal... And stepped on the lion's den looking from an ember. And I came to the dwellings of the tribe while the night lowered its head... The robe of the horizon embroidered with bright stars. I look in it at the cold of iron, and perhaps... I stumbled on the tips of the straightened brown spears. I did not meet the spears over armor... But I said: A branch that shaded over a river. Nor did I see the blaze on a sorrel horse... But I said: Bubbles circling on wine. So I walked while the heart of the lightning throbbed in jealousy... There, and the eye of the star looked from there askance.'\nI said: Look at these verses which were poured into a wondrous mold and strange style. While its owner describes the blackness of the night when horses inclined on him every inclination, and while he fights lions, behold he sighs over breasts. And while he sets up the statures of beauties in the place of spears, behold he says to their cheeks: 'Whoever turned away from their fires... Then I am Ibn Qays (Majnun), no departure.' He excelled in metaphor in them, and traveled with their high organization and number the seven planets. So his organization is in the stars, and the tear of the flame-wearer in his state is like meteors. Of his poetry in this pattern and his pearl entering this string is his saying also: 'And a night I knocked on the Malikiyyah under it... I renew, by the rule of youth, a visit. So I mixed the tips of spears with stars... And trod with the halos of full moons, dwellings.'\nHe also said: 'A phantom of his distracts me with a promise of a sip... Creating desire with procrastination and softness. I split for it a deep sea of sharp swords... Upon which are bubbles of spearheads of ash wood.'\nIbn Bassam said: 'I endured the hateful I hear... From a group regarding you; were it not for you, they would not have spoken. And regarding you, I flattered a people who have no morals... Were it not for you, I would not know they were created.'\nAnother said: 'Our souls become easy to us in (seeking) heights... And whoever seeks highness, the dowry does not fatigue him.'\nAnother said: 'He dives in the sea who seeks pearls... And whoever seeks highness stays up nights. You desire glory then sleep at night... You have made your soul hope for the impossible.'\nAl-Mutanabbi said: 'You want to attain heights cheaply... And the honey is not without the sting of bees.'\n\nChapter Twenty-Six: The Goodness of Mentioning the Beloved",

    "text": "I say: We established this chapter to mention one who assaulted and roamed, and remembered his beloved when blades broke, in every position where standing is defeat and death is booty. Especially if bows were set up in the place of eyebrows, the helmet was confused with the breasts of buxom girls, spears resembled statures, and swords (resembled) the redness of cheeks. There, he places his indicated beloved before his eyes, and the striking of the sword does not distract him from him, nor does making him a target for arrows. Regarding this is the story of Al-Tughra'i, in which he exceeded Antara al-Absi and increased in loyalty to the condition of love over every Jinn and human. It is what more than one historian narrated, of those who knew and reported and undertook and led. That is that Mu'ayyad al-Din Fakhr al-Kuttab Abu Ismail al-Husayn al-Asbahani the Creator, known as Al-Tughra'i, the scribe of construction for King Mas'ud. Between his brother Sultan Mahmud near Hamadan and Rayy, King Mas'ud was defeated. Al-Tughra'i was the first to be taken. When the Sultan, the brother of his master, resolved to kill him after things were said to him about him, among them that he was a heretic and that he loved such-and-such Mamluk of the Sultan's Mamluks whom the Sultan loved and inclined towards. So they incited him against him until he ordered his killing, and that he be tied to a tree and a group stand facing him to shoot him with arrows. That was done. He positioned a person behind the tree without Al-Tughra'i sensing him, and ordered him to listen to what he said. He said to the archers: 'Do not shoot him until I signal you.' So they stood, arrows in their hands notched to shoot him. Some of the people of literature who told me this story informed me that the first who notched the arrow at him was the Mamluk he was enslaved by loving. Al-Tughra'i recited in that state saying: 'And I say to the one aiming his arrow... Towards me, while the tips of death are pointed. And death is in the glances of his dark-eyed gaze... Before me, and my heart before it is cut to pieces. By Allah, search my heart, do you see... In it a place for other than the love of loved ones? Welcome to it (death) if there were not within its fold... The covenant of the beloved and his entrusted secret.' The Sultan ordered his release and the untying of his bonds when he saw the steadfastness of his heart and the magic of his expression. This lover exceeded those before him characterized by this description, like Ibn Ata al-Sindi where he says: 'I remembered you while the spear walked between us... And the straightened brown spears had drunk from me. By Allah, I do not know, and I am truthful... Is it a malady that afflicted me from your imagination or magic?'\nAntara said: 'I remembered you while spears were drinking... From me, and the white Indian swords were dripping with my blood. So I wished to kiss the swords... Because they shone like the lightning of your smiling mouth.'\nHow tender is the saying of Al-Tughra'i also: 'I remember you when thirst has reached... Me, so I choke on the cold fresh water. And I say: Would that I saw my loved ones... Before death, even by one day.'\nAnother said: 'I remembered Salma while the heat of battle... Was like my heart the hour I left her. So I likened the brown spears to her stature... When they inclined towards me, so I embraced them.'\nIbn Tamim said: 'Lo, who will inform the beloved that I... Stood while the flame around me was slight. And that I roamed the army of enemies... With my spear while he roamed in my thought.'\nHe also said: 'And I remembered you while the sharp swords were shining... Around us and the Samhari spears were pointed. Despite fighting the enemy, there is in the vitals... A longing for you which the ribs are too narrow for. From youth and onwards, my trait is... Preserving affection, so how can I return from it?'\nAl-Sharif al-Bayadi said: 'And I remembered you while the doctor was frowning... And the probe was immersed in the wound. The skin of my face, his iron had cut it... And his right hand was cautious over a left. So you distracted me from what I encountered, although... The regions narrow from it despite their width.'\nIbn Rashiq said: 'And I remembered you in the ship while death... Was crashing, anticipated waves. The atmosphere pouring and winds storming... And the night black of braids, dark. On the coasts for the enemies was an army... Waiting for a raid and commotion. A clamor rose for the companions of the ship... While I and your memory were in the sweetest secret conversation.'\nAbu al-Thana Mahmud said: 'And I remembered you while swords were shining... And death watched under the fortress of the watchtower. Beauty in the twilight of armor, you think it... A beauty strutting in a gilded robe. Death plays with souls while my mind... Amuses itself with the goodness of your sweet memory.'\nSafi al-Din al-Hilli said:",

    "text": "'And I remembered you while the dust was as if it were... The procrastination of the rich and the bad living of the poor. And death was between one thrown on stones... Among us, and one helmeted in a helmet. I thought I was in a shining morning... By the light of your face, or a moonlit evening. The land of struggle was perfumed as if... The land of combat was opened for us with ambergris.'\nHe also said: 'I remembered you while skulls were falling... Under the hooves and palms were flying. Heads in the horizon of the dust hovered... As if they were eagles above eagles. So a euphoria from the goodness of your memory accustomed me... And cheerfulness and joy appeared on me. So I thought I was in the gatherings of my pleasure... While wine was presented and cups circulated.'\nAnother said: And he has a story like the story of Al-Tughra'i mentioned previously in 'Manazil al-Ahbab': 'And I remembered you while spears were seizing me... Before the Imam while my forearm was shackled. And I remembered you, by the One whom I am His slave... While the sword was drawn above my forelock.'\nAbu Talib al-Raffa' said: 'And I remembered you while the darkness was like... The day of separation and the heart of one who did not love.' People have discussed this verse.\nSheikh Athir al-Din Abu Hayyan said: 'And I remembered you while the vast sea, its waves... Transgressed, and mankind from it was on a journey. In a night that lowered the curtain of its darkness... And its star sank from the eyes of humans. And the ship in the middle of waves, you think it... An eye that has closed an eyelid upon an eyelid. The soul, out of sadness, went having arrived at... My chest (Sadr - also means return from water), so oh for a generic arrival (Wird) without a return (Sadr). This, while your figure does not detach from my mind... And in my heart and in my hearing and in my sight.'\nI said in the Ramal meter on the road from Egypt to Sham from a Maqama: 'And I remembered you at Raml (sand), its fright... Is in the heart of every easterner and westerner. While the sons of Bayada were like locusts around us... With their blackness they blocked the wide ropes. And the sharp swords cut the heads of every armored one... From the hand of a bold one disciplined in wars. The tips of spears shine in the darkness... Like the flash of lightning in the darkness flaming. And upon the lances every vulture falling... Tears the skin of the lion with a claw. Thunder for the spears is a crashing thunder... And the sea roars like the conquering lion. The land is a sea of blood and the sea is land (beneficent)... With the Franks and every mangy dog. On the coasts is a blind raid, there is not... therein for one hoping safety any escape. And I, with the strings of bows, am as if I... Am singing in it of Al-Rabab and Zaynab. And I say: Would that my loved ones knew what... I am in of amusement and pleasant life.'\nMajnun Laila said: 'I remembered you while the pilgrims had a clamor... In Mecca, and hearts had a throbbing. I said, while we were in a Sacred Land... In it hearts became sincere to Allah: I repent to You, O Merciful, from what... I committed, for sins have multiplied. As for the love of Laila and my leaving... Her visit, indeed I do not repent.' People have comments on this last verse.\nIt is told regarding Laila al-Akhayliyyah that she passed with her husband by the grave of Tawba bin al-Humayr. He said to her: 'This is the grave of the liar who said: \"If Laila al-Akhayliyyah greeted... Me while rocks and slabs were upon me. I would have greeted with the greeting of cheerfulness or... An owl crying from the side of the grave would shriek to her.\"' She said: 'Leave him.' He said: 'I swear upon you, you must approach it and greet him.' She refused, but he repeated it to her. When she advanced to the grave and said: 'Peace be upon you, O Tawba,' a bird flew from the side of the grave that was there and shrieked. Laila's camel shied from it, so she fell from its top, broke her neck, and died instantly. She was buried next to Tawba. This is among the wonders, because he fulfilled for her what he committed to after death.\nThe other reached (a limit) where he said: 'If my head were cut with a sword for her affection... My head would pass falling quickly towards her. If my body rotted under the layers of soil... I would rot while my heart is not forgetting you. If Allah seizes my soul, your mention becomes... A soul I live by as long as I remain among people.'\nAnother said: 'And I remembered you while the darkness frowned... And I was sitting in the houses, my loneliness. The atmosphere whistles from my sitting in the air... There is no friend in it to be my obstinate one. Bugs and mosquitoes around me are an army... Twisted against a drinking companion, my ugly one.",

    "text": "And the mouse plays in the corners constantly... And jumps like Al-Qa'qa' over my turban. And the spider weaves the suit of a tent... Hunting a fly passing my window. The food is bread like my head, dry... And the drink is bitter from an intruder, my stupidity. Hearing my tunes is the hum of a mosquito... And the squeak of a cockroach and the whistle of a little owl. So I wished to embrace the little mouse whenever... It jumped, because you are like it in lightness. And I envied the hands of the spider for their resemblance... To fingers you have, their resemblance in thinness. And I was delighted by the voice of the cockroaches, a melody... Since they resembled the melodies of my beloved's voice. So I wept out of longing since you are not with me... Enjoying my luxury in my room.'\n\nChapter Twenty-Seven: A Small Portion of Excellent Stanzas and Elegant Ghazal (Erotic Poetry), containing roses of cheeks and pomegranates of breasts and other things.\nI say: We established this chapter to mention a small portion of Ghazal, Nasib, and the beauties of Tashbib (erotic prologue), which delights its hearing and is taken for the rising of the ascendant of beauty. Like the saying of our compatriot, the witty poet Muhammad bin al-Afif: 'Does a rising one aid me, O rising of the full moon... While from my misery a line is descending on your cheeks? Yes, it reached the limit in harshness, prolonging... And at the limit, the one prolonging falls short. I was not mad in love before was seen... For my heart from your temple curls a rational one in captivity. Were it not for a spearhead from your glances, killing... I would not have known that your glance is languid. And why should passion not be valid regarding you while a viewer... Facing a copy of beauty from your light? Even if Qays (Majnun) were describing a cheek of yours... A plant in it would disable him (pun on Baqil/greenery and Baqil/inarticulate).'\nYes, this chapter is one of the widest of these chapters in scope, boldest in running - no - and best in address and sweetest in origin. In it, the fat of poetry is distinguished from its lean, and its new from its worn out. Only that one excels in it, and only one of much knowledge and \"what makes you know\" perceives it. It was previously mentioned that the most flirtatious verse Arabs said is Bashar's saying: 'I, by Allah, desire the magic of your two eyes... And fear the death-grounds of lovers.'\nMuhammad bin al-Afif said, and excelled as he wished: 'And eyes that sickened my body... And kindled for my heart the burning of anxiety. And cheeks like gardens, shining... The days of their roses have no decline. I was not of its gardens, I know... Allah, and I am roasting in its ember today.'\nHe also said: 'He resembles the gazelle in glance and turn... Who saw him coming and was not tempted? The best of Allah's creation in utterance or mouth... If he is not the most worthy of beauty, then who? In his mouth and cheek and form are... Water, greenery, and the beautiful face.'\nThese verses have a story that happened to Ibn Taqi who was killed in Cairo.\nHe also said: 'Whenever I intended untying the banner (band), his sides said... Our sanctuary is not lawful (yuhall - to be untied/lawful). If wine settled (hallat) in his cheek... Its cycle (dawrah) and descent (nuzul) are seen for his cheek-hair.'\nHe also said: 'His face appeared from above his brown stature... While he loomed from black braids in darkness. So I said: Wonder! How did the darkness not go... When the sun of the day rose on a spear?'\nHe also said: 'Sweeter than honey is the one I loved, and how often... Bitternesses in love were charmed by him. How can his saliva not be found pleasant... While his mouth is sugar (Sukkar), years (Sininat - pun on teeth/years)?'\nAnother said: 'A handsome one said: Describe me... You are eloquent in speech. I said a saying in brevity... Everything in you is handsome (Maliḥ).'\nIbrahim al-Mi'mar said: 'A handsome one said: My beauty... Increased in joy. How many meanings did my eyelid contain... I said: A thousand and fractions.'\nHe also said: 'I judged in the law of love my killer... And I have blood shed (Tall - also dew) on his cheek. The judge accused a glance of his... Verifying the sedition from him. And he inclined to the truth (Haqq), so when he saw... The stature of my adversary, he inclined with his stature.'\nKhatib Samhud said: 'He whom I loved said to me: Compare my stature... Since it shook with beauty, coquetry. I said: A branch on a pouring sand dune... The hand of the breeze shook it, so it leaned.'\nAl-Siraj Al-Warraq said: 'I said to the slender one who shamed... The little branch: The speech of the slanderers is not fitting for you.",

Unjust treatment. I said: O graceful of stature, yours is a stature. Were it not for the predators of your glance... The doves would have sung on it.'\nAl-Nur Al-Is'irdi said: 'We are content with wine, water, greenery... And the slender one, graceful of stature. And we left the positions of people out of asceticism... So why do they harm us with speech?'\nIbn Khafaja said: 'And a slender one, folding the vitals... Like the branch, he struts if he struts. So if he gazes, and if he sings... And if he gives drink, and if he unveils. He shamed the gazelle and the dove... And the cloud and the moon.'\nKuthayyir Azza said: 'Allah knows, if I wanted an increase... In Azza, I would not find an increase. The monks of Madyan and those I knew... Weeping out of fear of punishment, sitting. If they heard as I heard her speech... They would fall down to Azza bowing and prostrating.'\nHe also said from verses, and it is the best said regarding good speech, and it has a story Al-Mubarrad recounted in 'Al-Kamil': 'Of the shy white women, her sitter wishes... Whenever a story ended, that she would repeat it.'\nIbn al-Rumi said: 'And her speech is the lawful magic, were it not that... It committed the killing of the guarded Muslim. If it is long, it is not boring, and if she summarized... The spoken-to wished she had not summarized.'\nIbn Hamdis said: 'Speech from her is not tired of when repeated... Like inhaling air, it is not tired of.'\nIbn Abi al-Hadid said: 'By Allah, put your feet on my eye sockets... For I am content regarding union with that. And prolong conversing with me, for my ears... Desire your speech just as I desire you.'\nAnother said: 'And a handsome one to whom I said: What is the name... My beloved? He said: Malik (Owner/King). I said: Describe to me your glowing face... And describe the softness of your moderation. He said: Like the full moon and like the branch... And what resembles that.'\nAl-Atawi said: 'Possessor of two soft cheeks, stingy... With what is in them of apples. And teeth and saliva like a pool... Of wine and a garden of chamomiles.'\nImru' al-Qais said: 'O my two friends, pass by Umm Jundub with me... We fulfill the needs of the tormented heart. Did you not see me, whenever I came knocking... I found goodness (perfume) in her even if she did not wear perfume.'\nAl-Numayri said and excelled in description: 'And a white, lazy, buxom virgin... Her embracing is delicious to the one of the full moon night. As if the flash of lightning is between me and her... When her smiling comes from some of the houses.'\nIbn Abi Rabi'a said: 'A young girl, cold of summer when... The heat of summer becomes critical in Najd. Hot of winter, a quilt for the youth... Under a night when the cold covers him.'\nAl-Mutanabbi said: 'She loosened three braids of her hair... In a night, so she showed me four nights. And she faced the moon of the sky with her face... So she showed me two moons at a time together.'\nIbn al-Mustawfi al-Irbili said: 'She saw the moon of the sky, so she reminded me of... The nights of her union at Al-Raqmatayn. Both of us are looking at a moon, but... I saw with her eye and she saw with my eye.'\nI say: People have discussion on it and crowding on understanding it, to the point that some wrote a book on it.\nAnother said: 'By my spirit and body, that cheek-hair which... Became, its musk flowing over the temples. Her cheek knew that I am going mad from love... So it showed me chains before madness.'\nSa'd al-Din Muhammad bin Arabi said: 'When his two cheek-hairs appeared in a pattern... It was said: Darkness mixed with light. And it was said: Ants fell upon ivory... And a group said: It is the Lam only.'\nAnother said: 'I saw the crescent on the face of one... I saw the crescent on his face.'\nAnother said: 'She appeared, so a mirror of beauty polished by beauty... Met my gaze from her face. I weep, so I look at my tears on her cheek... Running, so I think she is weeping for me.'\nIbn Qalaqis said: 'Above your cheeks is a proof... That your breasts are fruits. The pomegranate did not hide except... The pomegranate blossom appeared.'\nAl-Khabbazrazi said: 'I saw the crescent and the face of the beloved... So they were two crescents upon looking. So I did not know, out of my confusion between them... The crescent of darkness from the crescent of humans.",

So everyone who sought his glance, he sipped him. Beauty wrote above his cheek... This is a handsome one, by the truth of Him who created him.'\nIbn Rashiq said: 'Moderate of stature and size... Rosy of cheek and cheek. Say to the one whose beauty amazes him... Read upon him Surat Al-Hamd.'\nHe also said: 'I complained of love to my oppressor... So he said to me mockingly: What is it?

The rose of her cheeks did not appear except... It burned its lovers with pomegranate blossoms (Julnar - implies fire). Describe to me her hair as night and long... And say regarding the waist a saying with brevity (Ikhtisar - pun on shortness/waist). Her lips circulate for us a wine... Close in era to a circulating cup.'\nAnd from it: 'I lacked you, O my blamer regarding him, tell me... If the cheek-hair appears, what is my excuse? As if you did not feel that my love... Became with his cheek-hair good of emblem (Shi'ar - pun on hair). I became corresponding regarding him in a script... Close in shape to the dust pen (fine script). He gave me drink from his kiss a potion... Pure, not soiled by pressing. And followed his union with abandonment, so my heart... Is on the verge of abandonment, crumbling. Whenever his desire leads me one day... I walked while the drops of my tears were like the train (Qitar). Does my time make me covet a life of ease... While dragging tears in it over the neighbor (Jiwar - pun on running/neighbor)?'\nI also said from a poem praising our Master Sultan Hasan: 'Congratulations and joy followed in succession... And a bringer of glad tidings announced your arrival to us. And at the Citadel of the Mountain there was expansion... And joys and loved ones and presence. Towers of the horizon, in it is a single full moon... And full moons agreed with its towers in it. Gazing with glances in its darkness... So languor did not sleep nor slacken.'\nAnd from it: 'I am jealous of the breeze with her whenever... Its palm shakes the curtains in it. If she spreads her braids, she shows... To the dead of love in the world a resurrection. She has a mouth that guards pearls... A guard spends the night over it out of modesty. And a difference between the light of morning when... It appears and between him is a big difference.'\n\nChapter Twenty-Eight: Mention of a small portion of the news of Excellent Singers among men and secluded women (slave girls), and what carries that meaning regarding their Mawwals and describing their instruments.",

    "text": "I say: We established this chapter to mention one who rested from trouble by listening to singing, from every lover who mentions youth in poetry and sings with the Rebab. He plays the Oud and combines, from the masculine and feminine, between a thing and its opposite. Nothing inflames him but his musical instruments. Especially if he is, in singing, among those who know correctness, establish syntax, saturate melodies, balance meters, hit the genres of rhythm, give the note its right of saturation, steal the places of beats, fulfill what resembles them of strikes, excel in stealing (breaths/notes), fill breaths, and other things known to the masters of this affair of weights, among those who combined in that beauty and benevolence, as was said: 'She did not sing except worry was relieved... From my heart and sorrows took off. Singers are preferred in goodness and beauty... Just as seeing is preferred over hearing.'\nPeople in singing are all slaves of Ma'bad and Ishaq al-Mawsili, who are the most naturally gifted of the ancients in singing according to what more than one historian narrated. Regarding Ma'bad, Habib (Abu Tammam) says: 'The beautiful descriptions of singers are many... But the canes of precedence are only for Ma'bad.' Al-Buhturi said describing the neighing of a horse: 'Trilling in neighing, in his tones were... The tones of Ma'bad in the first neigh.' This Ma'bad was devoted to the Barmakids and died in the days of Al-Rashid. His news is too famous to be mentioned; the author of Al-Aghani and others mentioned it.\nAs for Ishaq al-Mawsili, he was of the people of knowledge, literature, narration, and precedence in poetry. His virtues are too famous to be described. He is the one who corrected the genres of singing and distinguished its methods with a distinction no one before him or after him was capable of, in terms of scrutinizing the courses and distinguishing the categories which they made one category, while they are in themselves so, but they separate for an alert one like him. Of his words: 'The limits of singing are four: Note, Composition, Rhythm, and Division.' He had asked Al-Ma'mun that his entry be with the people of knowledge and literature, not with singers, and if he wanted him for singing, he would call him. He granted him that. Al-Wathiq said: 'Ishaq never sang to me except I thought my kingdom was increased. Indeed, Ishaq is a favor among the favors of the King which no one has been lucky to have the like of. If life and vigor could be bought, I would buy them for him with half my kingdom.'\nHe sat with Ibrahim bin Mus'ab to drink. The boys gave drink to those present. An ugly-faced boy came with a cup to Ishaq, but he did not take from him. Ibrahim said to him: 'Will you not drink?' He said: 'Your drinking companion has become (desiring) cups chained... From the cool wine, and I follow them with cups. From the hand of a fawn, beautiful of coquetry, whose saliva... After sleep is like musk in struggle. Do not drink wine except from the hands of our Lord (Idol/Beloved)... Kissing his palm is more desirable than the wine.' So he called for a maidservant of perfect beauty in the guise of a boy, wearing tunics and a belt. She gave him drink until he was drunk, then he ordered her sent to him with everything with her to his house.\nAmong what Ishaq composed, and it has a witty story: 'Tell me who turned away blaming... And distanced his side from you. You have attained what you wanted... Even if you were playing. And confess what you claimed... Even if you were lying.' I have left the story of these verses fearing elongation. This amount is sufficient regarding the news of Ishaq in this place.\nAbu al-Faraj narrated that a slave girl of utmost beauty was gifted to Al-Rashid. He secluded himself with her in his palace one day and drank in the morning. Those of his slave girls present for singing and service exceeded two thousand, in the best attire of clothes and jewels. The news reached Umm Ja'far (Zubaydah), and that was great upon her (distressed her). She sent to 'Ulayya, Al-Rashid's sister, complaining to her. 'Ulayya sent to her: 'Let this not anger you. By Allah, I will return him to you. I have resolved to compose poetry and craft a melody for it and cast it to my slave girls. So send to me every slave girl you have and dress them in types of clothes and jewels so I can teach them the voice (song) with my slave girls.' Umm Ja'far did what 'Ulayya ordered her. When Al-Rashid prayed Asr, he did not realize until 'Ulayya had come out to him from a palace, and with her were more than two thousand slave girls wearing strange clothes, and all of them in one tune singing these two verses: 'Separated from me, while... My heart is not separated from him. O my cutter, tell me to whom... Did you intend to connect after me?'",

    "text": "He said: So Al-Rashid was delighted and stood on his feet until he met Umm Ja'far, and 'Ulayya was with him, and he was in utmost joy. He said: 'I have never seen joy like today.' He said to Masrur the servant: 'Do not leave any money in the treasury except that you scatter it.' The amount of what he scattered that day was six thousand thousand (six million) dirhams. The like of that has never been heard of.\nIt is told regarding Judge Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Isa that he went out to attend a funeral. A man from his brothers had a house near a graveyard, so he invited him to turn to it. He went down and food was brought to him. A slave girl sang: 'The cups became pleasant by the goodness of your gums... And the apples boasted of the redness of your cheek. And if the spring's spirits breathed... Souls grew by the scent of your breeze. And if darknesses let down their gloom... Then the light of your face in the dark is a lamp.' The Judge wrote it on the back of his hand out of delight with it, then left. His narrator said: I saw him saying Takbir over the funeral while these verses were on the back of his hand.\nHow excellent is the saying of Ibn Tamim regarding a female oud player: 'And a young woman who tamed the Oud until... It became, after recalcitrance, submissive. It feared the rubbing of its ear when it disobeyed her... For this reason, it says as she says.'\nAnother said: 'May Allah water a land that grew your wood (Oud) from which... Branches thrived and planting places were good. Birds sang on it while the wood was green... And soft maidens sang on it while the wood was dry. So there ceases not to be upon it or by it a delight... Stirred by the two mutes: the bird and the string.'\nIbn Hajjaj said: 'This, and one doing good with the Oud, her lover... Is pleased with that perfume in doing good. When she bent and sang behind her stature... A branch upon which, before dawn, is a blackbird.'\nAnother said: 'And a slave girl, if she sang you a voice... You have no escape from parting with clemency. As if her left hand on the Oud is lightning... And her right hand when she strikes it is thunder.'\nAnother said: 'She pointed with slender tips as if they were... Tubes of pearls capped with carnelian. And she circled on the strings probing as if they were... The fingertips of a doctor on the probe of veins.'\nAl-Nur Al-Is'irdi said regarding a female harpist (Jankiyyah): 'The harp (Jank) of the daughter of Sha'ban, when she makes it speak... Becomes mocking of the types of melodies of mankind. No wonder if it hunts the hearts of men for her... Do you not see it resembling the claw of the hawk?'\nAl-Salah al-Irbili said and excelled as he wished: 'The harp (Jank) is a boat of intellect in its shape... And the neck is the knocking, to it the strings are ropes. It runs with the wind of longing in seas of desire... Heading for a coast of union in which are loved ones.'\nIbn Daniyal said regarding a female tambourine player (Daffiyyah): 'Possessor of the stature which a branch of a dune shakes... If a bird passed over it one day, it would chirp. She shows on the tambourine her wrist like the palm heart... To tap it with fingertips resembling the Balaj (brightness). Her singing mixes with the saliva of the wind... So it does not dot except every one who sweated.'\nIbn Adim said regarding a female singer: 'By Allah, if peoples were fair to themselves... They would give you what they hoarded in them and what they preserved. You are not, when you sing in their gatherings... Anything but the breeze of the east, and the people are branches.'\nI said: 'And a songstress perfect in meanings... With kindness upon which there is no increase. If she delighted us with the second strings... She bent between the pomegranates of breasts. The brown spears are jealous of her when she appears... Like the branch of the Ban tree in green robes. With fingertips red from henna... And glances black like Indian swords. Her side-locks are of basil, fresh... The anemone of the cheeks fraternizes with them.'\nAnother said: 'By my father! Songs of a singer... Whom souls always accept. He sings, so we gaze with cups... At him and dance with heads.'\nAnother said: 'And a piper sends in his piping... Joys to the hearts of people. As if Israfil in his flute (Nay)... Is blowing souls into the dead.'\nAnother said regarding a flute player (Mushabbib): 'And a singer, we have seen in his fingertips... A flute (Shabbaba) worthy of the joy of the soul. As if he is a lover whose beloved arrived... So he embraced her with his hands then kissed her.'\nIbn Qarnas said regarding a handsome flute player: 'A flute player (Mushabbib), with his harshness went to kill us... Then he rectified us with blowing sometimes. I loved his erotic poetry (Tashbib) before seeing him... And the ear loves before the eye sometimes.'\nI said: 'May Allah guard the masters of the reed (Yara' - flute), for they... Removed my excuse regarding them with Udhri love. Their connectors (flutes/fingers), from their blowing every hour... Brought us love from where I know and do not know.'\nI also said riddling about a flute (Shabbaba): 'And a mute one, if she spoke we saw... The contradiction of her deed, a strange matter. Veiled, and she has no wrapper... She comes to us and did not fear the watcher. A girl, if my companions were alone with her... You would see they have a share in her with me. Every lover disputes with me over her love... Even if she does not resemble the nurtured fawn. How many a lover she exposed among us... And how often she gathered a beloved in her session. She renews for me, if she speaks, a joy... That returns my worn-out time new. Softer than the moist breeze in voice... And faster among mankind than it in blowing. She flirts always with her eyes with whoever... Exchanges erotic poetry and love poetry with her. So leave blaming me if I wandered in love with her... And recited to me of the strange poetry. And sing erotically for me with her always and say to me... Types of people are lovers of types. The most treacherous of them is a lover possessing boredom... And the most excused of them is the most resembling a beloved.'\nAl-Musais the Tailor said satirizing an Oud player: 'And when he sat cross-legged, he did not sit cross-legged after it... And began moving his Oud sluggishly. As if all the rats of the city... Are in his Oud nibbling dry bread.'\nAnother said: 'Abu al-Fadl sang, so we said to him... Glory be to Him who emptied him of Fadl (virtue/talent). His singing is a Hadd (punishment) upon his drinking... So drink, for you are today lawful (to kill/punish).'\nThe most eloquent said in dispraising the singer is the saying of Kushajim: 'And a singer, cold of tone... Impaired of hands. No one saw him in... The house of a people twice.'\nAnother said: 'And a cold singer... Took pleasures away from us. We asked him for silence... But he refused to be silent for us. So we cursed him, and he sang... So the pimp took revenge on us.'\nAnother said: 'A singer, the badness of her words... Kills joy and revives distress. Ugly of face, gap-toothed... Neither for marriage nor for music.'\nAnother said: 'And many a female piper, her piping stirs... The wind of bellies, so would that she did not pipe. I compared her fingertips on her beats... And her ugly, hideous, bad-breathed mouth. To beetles that intended a corpse and went... Striving towards it on a cucumber of Shanbar.' This is like their saying in the proverb: 'He saw the carrier and the carried and the house of agency.'\nAnother said: 'She is in the state of viewing... Beetles crawling on a snake.'\nHow excellent is the saying of Al-Wajih Al-Darari regarding one who sings with the Rebab and unites loved ones: 'Do not send anyone but the tortured Ja'far... For the Sheikh in all matters is polite (Muhadhdhab). Sometimes he sings with the Rebab, and at times... Al-Rabab and Zaynab come at his hand.'\n\nChapter Twenty-Nine: Mention of those afflicted in this time with the love of women and boys.\nI say: We established this chapter to mention the lovers of this time of ours, and they are what you know by their marks. Among them are those characterized by fairness and followed the path of the predecessors in chastity. This type, as it appears, is rarer than red sulfur; I have not seen him nor seen one who saw him. Even if I found his name, where is his named entity? 'So testify to the truth of my speech... Or no, belie me with one.' Far from it! Rather, the utmost of the people of this age is that one of them falls in love in the morning, unites at noon, and forgets in the afternoon. Regarding this is the story of some scholars of Medina as recounted by Amr bin Shaybah. He said: A man would love a young woman, so he would circulate around her house for a year, rejoicing if he saw one who saw her. If he attained her in a gathering, they complained to each other and recited poems. Today, he signals to her and she signals to him, so he promises her and she promises him. If they meet, he does not complain of love nor recite poetry, and rises to her as if he is, regarding her marriage (intercourse), the trustee of trustees, as was said: 'He does not step from inside the vestibule leaving... Except her anklet has approached the earring.'\nAl-Asma'i said: I said to a Bedouin woman: What do you count as Love among you? She said: Hugging, squeezing, winking, and conversation. Then she said: O city-dweller, how is it among you? I said: He sits between the legs of his beloved then strives against her. She said: O son of my brother, this is not a lover; this is a seeker of a child.",

    "text": "A Bedouin was asked about that. He said: 'It is sucking saliva and kissing the mouth, and taking a share of the pleasant parts of conversation. So how is it among you, O city-dweller?' He said: 'Severe biting, joining the knee and the jugular vein, and shaking (intercourse) that wakes the sleepers and necessitates sins.' He said: 'By Allah, an enemy does not do this, so how about a beloved?'\nI said: It has been mentioned previously that Kings are like others in Love, and that a great King may love but his love does not lead him to abandon the management of his kingdom. There is another class below Kings; if they love, they do not have free time due to their busyness with their crafts. And another class are stingy with their religion and minds to occupy their hearts with what is not lawful for them and is forbidden to them. As for other than these, their love is a symptom among symptoms, nay a disease among diseases. If they reach him, they hasten to turn away from him, and perhaps it becomes abandonment, nay enmity until the end of life. This is the dominant trait of the people of this time of ours. It is the most corrupt type of love, for it exists at leisure and goes at busyness, occurs at the dominance of lust and vanishes with its vanishing. It is the weakest of them inevitably. Its owner's matter is easy, for he forgets with aversion and loves with little loyalty. Whoever's state is this, his matter is easy and his ember is extinguished by urination.\nAmong the people of this age are those who restricted themselves to the doll of the palace, so he wandered with the beautiful among women. Among them are those who cast off restraint regarding the beardless boy, and said to consolation regarding his red cheek: Fire and not Shame. Among them are those who coupled between the two groups and combined, from masculine and feminine, between the two opposites. You see him coming upon what is present and not stopping at any form of forms, as was said: 'I am the man having insight into every matter... I entered every door of youthfulness. My heart desires beardless boys and youths... And does not refuse the connection of buxom girls.'\nDik al-Jinn exceeded this where he said: 'I love beardless boys, fuzz-bearded ones, and grey-haired ones... And with the like of sons, the daughters. Take what is desired and loved by me... An animal in which life has settled.' He also said: 'I am, regarding my saying handsome... Or ugly, at rest. Everyone who walks on the face... Of the earth is handsome to me. The definition of what is married (intercourse) by me... Is an animal in which is a spirit.'\nIbn Tamim said, including: 'And a group blamed when I rode upon... A dark one, his beauties made their deed ugly. Let them blame as they could, I am a man... If I could, I would ride all people.'\nSome Sheikhs of the age said: 'And a critic who blamed regarding a cheek-hair (Arid)... And a stabber stabbing at his age. He said to me: His chin (hair) has come out. So I said: I do not think about his chin.' He also said: 'My passion was ignited by a grey-haired one... Brighter than the light of the full moon. Whenever he turns grey, he bows... May Allah whiten his face.'\nAlso some Sheikhs of the age said: 'They reprimanded me for his love saying... The chin will appear from him, so have patience on the sadness. I said to them: Desist, for I have fallen... By your right, with passion in him up to the chin.'\nAlso some Sheikhs of the age said: 'And one full of cheek-hair, I kissed him... So he repelled me and turned away from my kiss. And said: How often do I forbid you from doing this... While you do not think about my beard?'\nI wrote to some of them: 'Let our master be congratulated by a beloved who ceases not... In his union doing every good (Muhsin). How his beard adorned him in his face... Allah made it grow a good growth (Nabatan Hasana).' He wrote to me the answer to that: 'O praiser of the beard, our forgetting... The garden of it when it flourished will not be good. Since He made a good growth grow in it... I accepted it from him a good acceptance.'\nSo he was as was said: 'Far be it for one like me to repent from his love... He is a beloved below all worlds. I love him as a child in swaddling clothes, and beardless... And with a beard, and if greyness ascends him.'\nAlso some Sheikhs of the age said, having loved an old man: 'I was tasked with him, an old man; his greyness was... Upon his cheeks like jasmine on a rose. A possessor of intellect knowing what is wanted from a youth... I felt safe regarding him from a watcher and an adversary. They said: Mankind is two parts in the law of desire... For black beards are people, and people for beardless boys. I said to them: If I were to desire a beardless boy... I would desire a slender female, swaying of stature. Black beards, I saw in them a partner... So I preferred to remain with their white one alone.'\nAnother said, having loved an old woman: 'I was tasked with her, a grey-haired woman whose newborn has aged... And people have schools of thought in what they love.'",

    "text": "Yaqut al-Hamawi said: Those who singled out the people of Mosul with the attribution to sodomy wronged them, until they became a proverb. The poet said about them: 'Cheek-hair wrote on the page of his cheek... A line appearing to the contemplating onlooker. I exaggerated in extracting it, so I found it... No opinion (Ra'y) except the opinion (Ra'y) of the people of Mosul.' I have traveled the lands between Jayhun and the Nile, and whoever I saw does not depart from this school of thought. So I do not know why the people of Mosul were singled out with it. It was said the matter is not as Yaqut claimed in every aspect, because the mere inclination to the male is not devoid from any spot. But the people of Mosul add to that by inclining to those with beards, and perhaps they incline to one whose cheek-hair is grey. They say here: 'A hair and a hair', meaning a black hair and a white hair. Some of them call him 'Zarzuri' (Starling-like). This is rarely found in other than their land. They have been accused of this among the people of the lands, and the people of Alexandria, because they say: 'We do not give our small penny (Filaysa) except to one who spends it on his family and little children; we do not give it to one who eats Halawa with it.'\nSheikh Shams al-Din Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya said in his book 'Rawdat al-Muhibbin', after mentioning the story of 'Ad and what desire led them to of horrible destruction and continuous punishment, then the story of the people of Salih likewise, then the story of the lovers, the sinful debauchees, mounters of males and leavers of women (People of Lot), and how He seized them while they were playing in their immersion, and cut off their remnant while they were wandering in the drunkenness of their love, and how He combined punishments upon them that He did not combine on any of the nations. He made them predecessors for their brothers, the sodomites of the early and later times. He said: When they dared upon this disobedience and rebelled and paved a way for their brothers and established it, the angels cried out to Allah regarding that with a clamor, and the earth roared to its Lord regarding this matter a roar. The angels fled to the regions of the heavens and complained of them to all creatures. He, Glory be to Him, had judged that He does not seize the wrongdoers except after establishing the proof against them and presenting the promise and threat to them. When they opposed the Messenger sent to them and the proof fell upon them, Allah Almighty did to them what He informed of in His Mighty Book: \"So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay, marked from your Lord. And Allah's punishment is not from the wrongdoers far removed.\" This is the consequence of sodomites, lovers of the form (image). They are the predecessors, and their brothers are after them on the trail.\n'If they are not the people of Lot themselves... Then the people of Lot are not far from them. And they are waiting for them in the eclipse... At a watering place of murky oil and pus. They say: No welcome nor hello to you... Did your Lord not promise you with a threat? They said: Yes, but you have enacted... A path for us in love that is not praiseworthy. We approached the male with it out of our love for them... So they brought us, this love, an evil arrival. So you are more deserving of double the punishment than... Your follower in that, unguided. They said: And you, your messengers warned you... Of what we have met of a truthful threat. So you have no merit over us, for all of us... Taste the punishment of humiliation, a taste of increase. Just as all of us tasted the pleasure of their union... And our meeting place in the Fire is not far.'\nChief Judge Shams al-Din bin Khallikan narrated from Al-Asma'i that he said: I entered the mosque one day, I and Abu Ubaida. Behold, on the pillar where Abu Ubaida sits was written at a height of about seven cubits: 'May the God bless Lot and his followers... Abu Ubaida, say by Allah: Amen. For you are, to me, without doubt their remnant... Since you reached puberty and you have passed seventy.' He said to me: 'O Asma'i, erase this.' So I mounted his back and erased it after I burdened him. He said: 'You burdened me and broke my back, get down.' I said to him: 'The Ta remains.' He said: 'It is the worst letter of this verse.' It was said that when he mounted his back and burdened him, he said to him: 'Hurry.' He said: 'Lot remains.' He said: 'From this one flees.' The one who wrote that was Abu Nuwas. I said: It came in the interpretation of His saying Almighty: \"Indeed Gog and Magog are corrupters in the land,\" that their corruption was sodomy.\n\nSection: Looking at the face of the Beardless Boy (Amrad).\nHafiz Muhammad bin Nasir mentioned...",

    "text": "...from the Hadith of Mujalid from Al-Sha'bi, he said: Abd al-Qays came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and among them was a beardless boy of apparent beauty. He, peace be upon him, sat him behind his back and said: 'Looking was the sin of those who passed.' In 'Al-Kamil' from Abu Huraira: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, forbade that a man stare sharply at the beardless boy. Sa'id bin al-Musayyib used to say: 'If you see a man persisting in looking at a beardless boy, then accuse him.' Sheikh Muhyi al-Din al-Nawawi declared in 'Al-Minhaj' the prohibition of looking at the face of the beardless boy with desire or without desire. Al-Khatib mentioned from the Hadith of Abd al-Rahman bin Wafid from Amr bin Azhar from Aban from Anas, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: 'Do not sit with the sons of kings, for souls yearn for them with a yearning they do not have for young free women.' Ibrahim al-Nakha'i, Sufyan al-Thawri, and others of the predecessors used to forbid sitting with the beardless boy. Al-Nakha'i said: 'Sitting with them is a Fitnah (trial), and they are in the status of women.' It is told about Abu Sa'id al-Jazzar, who was among the Sheikhs known for asceticism and worship, that he said: I saw Iblis in my sleep passing aside from me. I said: 'Come.' He said: 'What can I do with you? You have cast off your souls what I deceive people with.' I said: 'And what is it?' He said: 'The world.' Then he said: 'However, I have a trick among you.' I said: 'And what is it?' He said: 'The company of youths.' I took the stick to hit him. He said: 'I do not fear the stick; I only fear the light of the heart.' Fath al-Mawsili said: 'I accompanied thirty Sheikhs of the Abdal (Substitutes/Saints); all of them said: Beware of associating with youths.' Abu Abdullah Ahmad bin al-Jallad narrated: I was walking with my teacher and saw a youth of beautiful form. I said: 'Do you think Allah will punish this form with Fire?' He said: 'Did you look at him? You will see its consequence.' He said: 'So I forgot the Quran after twenty years.' It is known that looking at the beardless boy drops one into the drunkenness of love, as the Almighty said about the lovers of forms: \"By your life, indeed they were in their intoxication wandering blindly.\" So looking is a cup of wine, and love is the drunkenness of that drink. The drunkenness of love is greater than the drunkenness of wine, for the drunkard of wine sobers up, while the drunkard of love does not sober up except when he is among the army of the dead. 'Drunk with the drunkenness of desire and the drunkenness of wine... And when does a youth sober up in whom are two drunkennesses?'\nSome Sheikhs of the age recited to me: 'O you who became having anguish for beardless boys... You are not right in loving them. In the wide-eyed virgins is what you desire... Of them, and they excel with the love of the beloved.'\nAnother said: 'Your love of boys, if... Women are possible for you, is fraud. One only fornicates in the back... If a belly is lacking.'\nHowever, the love of women also, and looking at whom it is not permissible to look at, contains what it contains of what cannot be remedied. It is established in the two Sahihs from the Hadith of Usama bin Zaid that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"I have not left after me a trial more harmful to men than women.\" I said: Especially the women of this time, from every sun of a chamber rising from her pimp between the horns of a devil, and others who occupied themselves with Lesbianism (Sihaq) and going out after her husband from the door or window, as was said in the meaning of that: 'Love of beardless boys occupied the substitutes (men)... And the occupation of the women of people became Lesbianism. Every gender with its gender has sufficed... So condolences, O assembly of sinners.'\nIt is told about some that he said to a slave girl practicing lesbianism: 'Return to the Truth (Haqq).' She said: 'Al-Haqq is some of my desire.' She means that Al-Sahq (Lesbianism) shares some letters with Al-Haqq. This is one of the witty answers. How worthy she is that it be said in her right: 'Fond of lesbianism, she became... Weeping over it with every eye. She was not content in disgrace except... To add Isaac (Ishaq) to Hunayn.'\nIt is told that a man entered a house and found two women in lesbianism. He pulled the one on top and sat in her place and said: 'This is a work that needs ropes and men.' Our Sheikh Zayn al-Din Ibn al-Wardi said regarding the women of the people of the age this poetry: 'Say to her who loves lesbianism which... Allah forbade and in which there is no good. You erred, O complete of beauty, when... You set up Isaac (Ishaq) in the place of Al-Zubayr.'\nAnother said: 'Say to her who claims lesbianism... Until when will you be a lesbian? Nothing cures your thirst... Among all creatures. Except a bald, poor man... Shaven, wandering.'\nIbn Sana' al-Mulk said: 'O this one, do not be shy... Of me, the covered has been revealed. If... yawned... stretched.'\nSome Sheikhs of the age said: '... If I called him... For a need specific to me. He stood for it himself... It is nothing but my nerve.'",

    "text": "Some friends asked me to compose something like this for them, so I said, seeking forgiveness from Allah and repenting to Him: 'She delayed due to her menstruation... I said to her: Advance... This is my nerve... It enters with you in the blood.'\nSome Sheikhs of the age said: 'And I used to, if I saw even an old woman... Hasten to stand up out of heat.

There is no harm in your standing for an hour.'\nI also said, seeking forgiveness from Allah the Great for every sin: 'When Love fulfilled the fast, he recited to me... And said: Stipulate what you wish and judge. For the command is your command, I have no opposition... If you fast, we fast, and if you break fast, we do not fast.'\nChief Judge Shams al-Din Ibn Khallikan narrated, after refuting the saying of some: 'My friend said to me when...

I wish I knew from where that loss is. From the yield of my estate, from my fabric... From the remains of the money of that trade? She attended me, so... stood at that time... Imitated by a cotton pod or a cucumber.'\nAnother said: 'Woe to you O... Do you not feel shy... Shaming me among my sitters? You come out of my collar like this intentionally...

    "text": "I say: We established this chapter to mention the most inclined of lovers, the clearest of them in proof, the best of them in conduct, the purest of them in conscience, and the most chaste of them despite ability. Especially Banu Udhra, who are the most intense of people in passion and the greatest of them in wandering. Therefore, I said: The saying of Love with Chastity in Banu Udhra is abundant, and those killed among them by love are a large multitude. If one of them is mentioned for chastity, then Jamil (is mentioned), beautiful (Jamil) of attributes, truthful of resolves. We will present of his news in this place what verifies this claim and confirms that finding solace in the beloved from others is a type of comfort. Of that is what Muhammad bin Ja'far al-Ahwazi recounted. He said: Jamil fell ill in Egypt with the illness in which he died. Al-Abbas bin Sahl entered upon him. Jamil said to him: 'What do you say about a man who never drank wine, nor fornicated, nor killed a soul, nor stole, testifying that there is no god but Allah?' I said: 'I think he has been saved and I hope Paradise for him. Who is this man?' He said: 'Me.' I said to him: 'I do not think you are safe while you have been flirting with Buthayna for twenty years.' He said: 'I am in the first day of the days of the Hereafter and the last day of the days of the world; may I not attain the intercession of Muhammad on the Day of Resurrection if I ever placed my hand on her for suspicion.' We did not stand until he died in the year eighty-two of the Hijra. Among the strange things Al-Zubayr recounted of Jamil's news is that the mentioned Buthayna was from Banu Udhra. Banu Udhra is a tribe famous for love among the Arab tribes, and Udhri love is attributed to them because they are the most loving of all Allah's creation. Sa'id bin Uqba said to a Bedouin: 'From whom are you?' He said: 'From a people who, if they love, die.' He said: 'Udhri, by the Lord of the Kaaba.' Then he said: 'Why is that?' He said: 'Because in our women is beauty (Sabaha) and in our young men is chastity.' A man said to Urwa bin Hizam: 'O you, by Allah, is it true what is said about you that you are the softest of people in hearts?' He said: 'Yes, by Allah, I left thirty youths in the tribe whom death has infected; they have no disease except Love.' A man from Banu Fazara said to a man from Banu Udhra: 'You count your dying of love a merit and a virtue, but that is weakness of constitution, narrowness of thought, and thinness and frailty found in you, O Banu Udhra.' He said to him: 'By Allah, if you saw the large black eyes, above them the arched eyebrows, beneath them the spaced smiling teeth, and the dark lips revealing the white serrated teeth, you would have taken them as Al-Lat and Al-Uzza.' Then he recited: 'I followed the throwing of the wild animals until they shot me... From the Nile, not with the swerving missing arrows. Weak ones killing men without blood... So oh wonder at the weak killers.' It was said to some of them: 'What would you do if you triumphed over whom you love?' He said: 'I would untie the veil and respect what is behind the wrapper, and show for love what pleases the Lord.' Hafiz Abu Muhammad al-Umawi said that a woman he trusts told him that a youth became attached to her and she to him, and their matter spread. They met one day alone. He said to her: 'Come, let us verify what is said about us.' She said: 'No, by Allah, this will never be while I recite: \"Close friends, that Day, will be enemies to each other, except for the righteous.\"' It was said to some of them whose love for a slave girl of his people had prolonged: 'What would you do if you triumphed over her and none sees you two but Allah?' He said: 'By Allah, I would not make Him the least of observers. I would not do with her alone except what I do in the presence of her family: long yearning and a glance from afar, and I leave what the Lord hates and what corrupts love.' It was said to another: 'What would you do if you triumphed over your beloved?' He said: 'Embracing her and kissing her, and disobeying Satan regarding her sin. I will not spoil the love of twenty years with the pleasure of an hour that vanishes and its reckoning remains. Indeed, if I did, I would be mean and a noble would not have birthed me.' I said: Among those characterized by chastity with the best attributes among the Caliphs is Harun al-Rashid. That is because he loved a slave girl. When he solicited her for herself, she said: 'Your father was intimate with me.' So he left her, and was enamored with her until he almost went out on his face. He used to recite: 'I see water and I have intense thirst... But there is no way to the watering place.'",

    "text": "The Judge said to him: 'Do you believe her saying every time a slave girl says something?' Al-Rashid said: 'There is no rank above the Caliphate.' So look at how beautiful the chastity of the slave girl was and the abstinence of Harun al-Rashid despite his intense fondness for her. Mansur bin Ammar entered upon him, so he brought him near until he touched his knees to his knees. Mansur said to him: 'O Commander of the Faithful, your humility in your honor is dearer to us than your honor.' He said: 'Admonish me.' He said: 'Whoever is chaste in his beauty, comforts with his wealth, and is just in his authority, Allah writes him among the righteous.' Al-Rashid wept and said: 'Increase me.' He said: 'If you sought a drink of water and did not find it except for half the world, would you buy it with it?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'If it became difficult for you after drinking it, would you buy its exit with the other half?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'May Allah make ugly a world bought with a drink of water and a urination.'\nIt is told regarding Sultan Malik Shah the Seljuk that a female singer came before him. He admired her and found her singing pleasant, so he intended her. She said: 'O Sultan of the World, I am jealous for this handsome beautiful face that it be punished in the Fire. The Halal (lawful) is easier, and between it and the Haram is a word.' He said: 'You spoke the truth.' He summoned the Judge and married her, and she remained in his bond until he died, may Allah have mercy on him.\nSuhayl, the greatest servant of Sultan Nur al-Din the Martyr, recounted that the mentioned Sultan bought a Mamluk for five hundred dinars, a robe of honor, and a mule. He was beautiful in form. He handed him to me, and I had raised the Sultan. I said to myself: 'To Allah we belong and to Him we return. He never bought a Mamluk for fifty dinars, so why did he buy this one for five hundred dinars?' Then he left me for days and said: 'Bring him with the Mamluks to stand in service every day.' After some days, he said: 'Bring him after Isha (night prayer) to the tent, and you and he sleep at the door of the tower.' I said to myself: 'This Sheikh, in the time of his youth, did not commit a major sin, and when his age advanced he falls into it? By Allah, I will kill him (the boy) before he falls into sin.' I took a strangling cord and prepared it, and came with the Mamluk while I was anxious. I stayed awake most of the night, and Nur al-Din was at the top of the tower. Then my eye overcame me and I slept. I woke up and my hand fell on the boy's face, and behold he was like an ember and had a high fever. I returned with him to my tent and brought the doctor, but he died at noon. I washed him, shrouded him, and buried him. Nur al-Din called me the second day and said: 'O Suhayl, indeed some suspicion is sin.' I was ashamed. He said: 'You have known my condition and you raised me. Did you find a slip in me?' I said: 'Far be it from Allah.' He said: 'Then why did you carry the strangling cord and your soul spoke evil to you? I am not infallible. When I saw the Mamluk, something like fire fell into my heart from him. I said: I will buy him, perhaps he removes from me what I am in. But it did not go away. My soul said to me: I want to see him every day. So I ordered you to bring him. It said: I want you to bring him to the tower at night. So I ordered you to bring him. When he attended, the soul did not let me sleep, and we remained in war until dawn. I intended to bring him up to me, but Allah overtook me with His mercy. I uncovered my head and said: My God, Your servant Mahmud, the Mujahid in Your path, the defender of the religion of Your Prophet, peace be upon him, who built mosques, schools, and ribs (hospices), ends his deeds with the likes of this? I heard a caller saying: We have sufficed you, O Mahmud. So I knew that something happened to him. As for you, may Allah reward you with good on my behalf. By Allah, that he be killed with me is lighter than disobedience.' Then he treated me well.\nIt is told regarding Fatima bint al-Khath'ami that she offered herself to Abdullah bin Abdul-Muttalib, father of the Prophet, peace be upon him, for the light she saw between his eyes. He refused and said: 'As for the Haram, death is before it... And the Halal, there is no solution so I clarify it. So how about the matter you desire?... The noble protects his honor and religion.' I said: The story of Abdullah with this Fatima is like their saying in the proverb: 'One desires the fig and another picks it.' His state with her is like the state of Tawba with Laila al-Akhayliyyah, which is what is told that he solicited her for herself, so she shied away from him and recited: 'And a possessor of a need, we said to him: Do not reveal it... For there is no way to it as long as I live. We have a companion whom we should not betray... And you are for another a companion and friend.' So she was as was said: 'We went mad for Laila, and she went mad for other than us... And another is mad for us whom we do not want.' And like the saying of the other: 'I was attached to her accidentally, and she was attached to a man... Other than me, and another woman was attached to the man.'",

    "text": "Among those characterized by chastity among the people of love is the Imam son of the Imam, Muhammad bin Dawood al-Zahiri. He has famous stories regarding that, and this is the place to present them and spread their garments. Of that is his saying: 'Everything has a Zakat, and the Zakat of the beautiful face is enabling the people of chastity to look at it.' His beloved Muhammad, and it was said his name was Wahb bin Jami' al-Saydalani, recounted that he entered upon the Commander of the Faithful, who asked him about Ibn Dawood: 'Did you see from him what you dislike?' He said: 'No, O Commander of the Faithful, except that I spent a night with him, and he would uncover my face then say: O Allah, You know that I love him and that I observe You regarding him.' He said: 'What extent did your care for him reach?' He said: 'I entered the bathhouse. When I came out, I looked in the mirror and found my image beautiful beyond what I knew. So I covered my face and swore that no one would look at my face before him. I hastened to him. When he saw me with covered face, he feared an affliction had befallen me. He said: What is the news? I said: I saw my face in the mirror just now, so I wanted no one to see it before you. So he fainted.'\nAl-Layth bin Sakra said: Muhammad bin Wasi' used to spend on Muhammad bin Dawood. No beloved was known in the past time who spends on his lover and draws near to his heart with types of kindness except this one, with what he is upon of maintenance (of dignity) and good religion. Praise be to Allah that we saw in our time one who adopts the morals of (noble) people. This lover has a strange story with this beloved; I omitted it fearing elongation.\nMuhammad bin Dawood had written the book 'Al-Zahrah' for the sake of his beloved Muhammad bin Jami' mentioned. It is a collection of literature in which he brought every strange and rare thing and elegant poetry. He said in its beginning: 'And how do you deny the change of time while you are one of its changers, and the roughness of brothers while you are the leader in it? Among the strange things days bring is an oppressor complaining, a cheater regretting, an obeyed one seeking help, and a conqueror seeking aid.' From his speech: 'I have not detached from desire since I entered the Kuttab (school). I started the book Al-Zahrah while I was in the Kuttab, and my father looked into most of it.'\nAmong the subtlest told about him is that he and Abu al-Abbas bin Surayj met in the gathering of Abu al-Hasan bin Isa the Vizier. They debated a question of Ila' (oath of abstention from wife). Ibn Surayj said to him: 'You, by your saying \"Whoever's glances are many, his sorrows endure,\" are more skillful than speaking in Fiqh.' Muhammad bin Dawood said to him: 'If you say that, then I say: I declare my eye above the garden of beauties... And forbid my soul from attaining a forbidden thing. And I bear of the weight of passion what if... It were on the deaf rock, it would demolish it. And my glance speaks for the interpreter of my thought... Were it not for my snatching its rejection, it would have spoken. I saw love as a claim from all people... For I do not see a true, safe love.' Ibn Surayj said to him: 'With what do you boast over me? If I wished, I would have said: And kept awake by the coquetry of his glances... I spent the night preventing him the pleasure of his slumbers. Out of pity for the beauty of his speech and admonition... And repeating glances at his cheeks. Until when the morning showed its column... He turned away with the seal of his Lord and his innocence.' Muhammad said: 'Preserve against him, O Vizier, what he admitted of the meeting until he establishes proof with two just witnesses of innocence.' Ibn Surayj said to him: 'Binding on me in this is what is binding on you in your saying: I declare my eye above the garden of beauties... And forbid my soul from attaining a forbidden thing.' He said: The Vizier laughed and said: 'You have combined knowledge, understanding, wit, and subtlety.'\nAmong the subtle things told about Muhammad also is what Abu al-Qasim al-Sa'igh recounted. He said: Muhammad bin Dawood said to me: 'I have not entered the mosque of the city from the side of the gate of Khurasan for twenty years.' I said: 'Why?' He said: 'Because I entered one day and saw two youths of the most beautiful people in face admonishing each other. When they saw me, they separated. So I swore not to enter from a gate where I was the cause of separation between two lovers.' Tha'lab entered upon him and said to him: 'Let us hear something of your youthful passion.' So he recited: 'May Allah water days for us and nights... That have playing fields in the regions of youth. When life was fresh and time was unaware... And the witness of the banes of lovers was absent.' Of his poetry: 'For every person there is a guest he rejoices in his nearness... And I have no guest but sorrows and worry. My friend says: How is your patience after us?... I said: Is there patience so it be asked about \"how\"?'",

    "text": "Ibn al-Sarraj said in the book 'Masari' al-Ushaq' (Death-grounds of Lovers): And from Abu Abdullah Ibrahim ibn Muhammad bin Arafa al-Nahwi, he said: I entered upon Muhammad bin Dawood al-Zahiri in his illness in which he died. I said: 'How do we find you?' He said: 'The love of whom you know has bequeathed to me what you see.' I said to him: 'What prevented you from enjoying him while having the ability to do so?' He said: 'Enjoyment is of two types: One is the permissible look, and the second is the prohibited pleasure. What prevented me from it is what my father told me; he said: Suwayd bin Sa'id told me, he said: Ali bin Mushir told us, from Abu Yahya al-Qaffaf, from Mujahid, from Ibn Abbas, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: \"Whoever loves, conceals, remains chaste, and is patient, Allah forgives his sin and admits him to Paradise.\"' Then he recited: '... Look at the magic running in his glances... And look at the intense blackness in his calm gaze. And look at hairs above his cheek-hair... As if they are ants crawling on ivory.' And he recited to us for himself: 'Why did they deny blackness in his cheeks... And did not deny the blackness of the eyes? If the fault of his cheek is the seed of hair... Then the fault of eyes is the hair of eyelids.' I said to him: 'You negated analogy in Fiqh and affirmed it in poetry.' He said: 'The dominance of desire and the possession of the soul called for it.' He died in his night, may Allah have mercy on him. I said: People differed regarding his saying, peace be upon him: \"Whoever loves, conceals, and remains chaste...\" the Hadith. Some said: Concealed his love from people. Some said: Concealed the name of his beloved. Al-Husri said: Loved and concealed, and was united and remained chaste, and was abandoned and died, he is a martyr. Uthman bin Zakariya the Tutor, one of the narrators of the Hadith from Suwayd, said: Concealed from his beloved that he loves him.\nThe Sheikh, Imam, Allama, Hafiz Ala' al-Din Abu Abdullah Mughlatay said in his book 'Al-Wadih Al-Mubin': This Hadith has a Sahih chain, even if a group of scholars found fault with it with what is not a fault by which it is rejected, meaning his saying peace be upon him \"Whoever loves and conceals...\" the Hadith. He also reported in his mentioned book that this Hadith's chain is like the sun; there is no doubt in its authenticity nor confusion.\nI said: For this reason, a group of jurists counted the dead of love among the martyrs, taking this Hadith, among them Al-Rafi'i and others. Some of them stipulated the mentioned conditions, and some generalized, like Sheikh Muhyi al-Din al-Nawawi, for he generalized and did not stipulate anything. He said: 'And the dead of love, and the woman dying in labor,' meaning among the martyrs. This is despite his strictness in religion and lack of leniency in these things. How excellent is the saying of Ibn al-Athir: 'The tear of the lover and the blood of the slain are equal in simile and representation, except that between them is a difference because they differ in color.'\nThe Imam, Allama Abu al-Walid al-Naji said: 'If the lover dies of ardency and love... Then that is martyrdom, O friend, truly. Trustworthy ones narrated it to us from trustworthy ones... Rising to the Ink (Scholar) Ibn Abbas.'\nAbd al-Karim al-Qushayri said: 'Indeed the lover, if he dies patient... His dwellings are with the martyrs. People narrated it who became in their truthfulness... A banner; and suffice you with this disease.'\nAl-Hasan bin Hani said: 'And we had narrated... From Sa'id from Qatada. From Sa'id bin al-Musayyib... That Sa'd bin Ubada. Said: Whoever dies loving... Is among the people of martyrdom.'\nIbn Rawaha al-Hamawi said and excelled as he wished: 'They blamed regarding you and did not know... That desire is the cause of happiness. If it is union, then it is the wish... Or if it is abandonment, then it is martyrdom.'\nHe reversed his saying here and said: 'O heart, leave desire and rest... You are not in a praiseworthy matter in it. I wasted my world by his abandonment... If I attain a union, the Hereafter is lost.'\nAnother said: 'O my two friends, have you been told or heard... That the victim of beautiful women is a martyr?'\nI said as if present addressing him: 'Yes, we have heard that whoever conceals desire... And remains chaste until he dies, he is a martyr. So take a saying in which you are wavering... For that is what you used to deviate from. The context of what the caravan of lovers narrates... By it every day is a driver and a witness. They circle the loved ones behind their houses... Among them standing around it and sitting. They swim in the sea of tears when... The ships of desire tilt with them and sway. Do you weep for less than a year a year away from them... While Labid set a year for weeping?'\nI said: The speech on these chapters has ended; Tight of knots, pure of coins, set of fractures, high of palaces. Each chapter of them containing a verse of a poem (Bayt Qasid) and a long meter (Bahr Madid).",

    "text": "It waters the fruit of its plantings and quenches the dry of its parchments. 'With two large eyes, if you shone them... At the rising of the Pleiades, its clouds would pour.' Nothing remains but the mention of the death-grounds of lovers, and the news of those among lovers who became dead of longings. 'If I do not die in the love of eyelids and eyes... Then oh my shame before lovers and oh my embarrassment. How good is death in the love of beauties like this... Especially by the swords of wide eyes. O my two companions, if I die between you two... Short of the two delicious ones: the rose of the cheek and the kiss. Then ask forgiveness for me and say: A lover of ghazal... Died slain by slender statures and eyes.'\nOur compatriot Muhammad bin al-Afif al-Tilimsani, may Allah have mercy on him, said: 'For lovers, in the rulings of passion, is satisfaction... So do not be, O young man, objecting with blame. My soul be the ransom for my loved ones, even if they broke... The covenant of loyalty to one who did not break the covenant. Stop and listen, being merciful, to the news of those who were killed... So he died in their love not attaining the purpose. He saw, so he loved, so he sought union, but they refused... So he sought patience, but attaining it exhausted him, so he passed away.'\nJarir said: 'Indeed, the eyes in whose glance is intense contrast... Killed us then did not revive our dead. They strike down the one of intellect until there is no movement in him... While they are the weakest of Allah's creation as pillars.'\nAnother said: 'My heart ceased not to desire the eyes... Until it was killed. Praise be to Allah who... died and it was not said he forgot.'\nAnother said: 'You see lovers slain in their dwellings... Like the Youths of the Cave; they do not know how long they stayed. A people, if they were abandoned after they were united (with)... Died; if those they desire returned, they would be resurrected.'\nMuhammad the Preacher said: 'Leave my blame, for the blame of you two is returning... And the killing of lovers has a Return (Resurrection/Hereafter). If desire killed the people of youthful passion... They would not die; if they were returned, they would return.'\n\nConclusion of the Book: Mention of those who died of their love and came to their Lord, small and great, rich and poor, despite their different types and varying quests. For the sake of mentioning them, I established the foundations of this book and entered it from a door and exited from a door, to arrive from it to the mention of one whom abandonment drove to the throes of death, and who bore of love what he had no power for, from the door to the window. From here I begin mentioning their death-grounds and presenting their goods, for among them is the loser and the winner, the righteous and the corrupt. Among them is wretched and happy, and among them is slain and martyr.\nAbu al-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi narrated saying: Our Sheikh Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Abdullah mentioned to me that a man loved a Christian woman until he was overcome in his mind, so he was carried to the hospital (Bimaristan). He had a friend who acted as a messenger between them. When the matter increased on him and death descended upon him, he said to his friend: 'The term has approached and I did not meet so-and-so in the world, and I fear dying upon Islam and not meeting her.' So he converted to Christianity and died. His friend went to the Christian woman and found her ill. She said: 'I did not meet my companion in the world and I want to meet him in the Hereafter. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.' Then she died.\nI said: I have not heard stranger than this story nor greater than this injury. The Book (Decree) preceded its owner, and a wall with a door was struck between him and his beloved. He was afflicted by the separation of his beloved and his religion with two diseases, and the circle of evil turned upon him in the two abodes. How not, when he arrived with his stagnation in love at the abode of ruin, and became with his disbelief and her Islam on the brink of a collapsing cliff? 'She traveled east and I traveled west... What a difference between an easterner and a westerner.'\nI was reminded by this story of the saying of Abd al-Wahhab al-Azdi mourning a Christian friend of his, and he excelled as he wished where he said: 'My brother in affection, not my brother in religion... And many a brother in affection is like a relative. They said: Do you weep today for one who is not a companion... Tomorrow? Indeed this is the action of one not intelligent. I said to them: Is this or my sorrow... And the intensity of my wailing and excess of my weeping? And from where do I weep for a beloved I lost... If my share of him in the Hereafter failed?'",

    "text": "This Christian was marked with beauty, a wine-seller. Abd al-Wahhab mentioned became attached to him and became famous for him. He stayed spending the night in the tavern for three years, entering the church with him on festivals and Sundays throughout this period, until he memorized much of the Gospel and the laws of his people. He (the Christian) abandoned him once, and he found no way to him. He claimed he had a strong oath not to speak to him for a period of a month. When he despaired, he called for the phlebotomist and bled one of his hands, and called another phlebotomist and bled the other hand. He entered his house, locked the door of his home, and opened the phlebotomies (veins). His family did not sense anything until the blood pushed from the threshold of the door of the place he was in. They reached him when he was on the verge of death. His Christian beloved reconciled with him fearing for his life. Of his poetry regarding him: 'Look at the mole on the cheek of one whose... Glances are, by the glance, his wounds. As if, from its beauty, it showed... A grain of musk atop an apple.'\n\nAnd among them is a martyr. Yaqut said in his History: Mudrik bin Ali al-Shaybani was a poet, a man of letters, virtuous. He used to frequently visit the Monastery of the Romans (Dayr al-Rum) in Baghdad and associate with its Christians. In the Monastery of the Romans was a boy from the children of the Christians called Amr bin Yahya. He was of the most beautiful people in form and most complete in character. Mudrik bin Ali loved him. Mudrik had a gathering where youths gathered, no others. If an old man or one with a beard attended, Mudrik would say to him: 'It is ugly for you to mix with youths and boys, so rise in the protection of Allah,' so he would rise. Amr used to attend his gathering, and Mudrik loved him and wandered for him. Amr came one day to the gathering. Mudrik wrote a note and threw it in his lap. He read it, and behold in it: 'By the gatherings of knowledge which... By you the beauty of their crowds is complete. Will you not have mercy on an eye... Drowned in the flood of its tears? Between me and you is a sanctity... Of Allah regarding wasting it.' He said: He read the verses, and those in the gathering stood upon it and read them. Amr was ashamed and stopped attending. The matter overwhelmed Mudrik, so he left his gathering and stuck to the abode of the Romans, and began following Amr wherever he wished. He said much poetry about him. Al-Hariri said: 'I saw Amr white of head and beard.' Of Mudrik's poetry regarding him is this strange, wondrous, famous Muzdawija (poem with rhyming hemistiches) which is: 'From a lover, his desire is far, near... Speaking of tear, silent of tongue. Tortured by repulsion and abandonment... Bound of heart, released of body. Without a sin his hands earned... Complaining of a desire his eyes revealed. Longing for the sight of who made him miserable... As if he healed him who made him ill. Woe to him, a lover, what does he encounter... From pouring tears that do not stop? Speaking and they did not perfect speech... Telling of a love to which he was enslaved. Nothing remained of him but a glance weeping... With tears like the arrangement of a thread (necklace). The fire of desire extinguishes them and kindles... Resembling the drops of the sky. Towards a gazelle from the sons of the Christians... The cheek-hair of his cheeks captured the virgins. And left the lions because of him confused... In the noose of love for him, captives. A Reem (white antelope) in the Abode of the Romans intended my killing... With a kohl-rimmed eye, not from kohl. And a forelock by which my mind flew... And a beautiful face and an ugly deed. A Reem by whom any lion is hunted... Killing with the glance and not fearing retaliation. Whenever he says \"Ha\" (Behold), the glances said \"Qad\" (Enough)... As if it is his humanity (Nasut) when it united (with Divinity). People altogether did not see a full moon... Nor saw a sun and a fresh branch. More beautiful than Amr, and I ransomed Amr... A fawn who with his eyes gave me wine to drink. Here I am, cut by his stature... And the tear on my cheek has a trench for it. What harm to one whose loss exists in him... If his repulsion did not make ugly his deed. If my sin with him is Islam... Then days have striven to dismantle it. And I broke (rules) for prayer and fasting... And the forbidden became permissible for him in religion. Would that I were for him a Cross... Being near to him forever. Seeing beauty and smelling perfume... Fearing no slanderer nor watcher. Would that I were for him an Offering (Qurban)... He kisses from it the mouth and fingertips. Or were I a Catholicos or a Metropolitan... So he sees obedience to me as faith. Would that I were for Amr a Scripture (Mushaf)... He reads from me every day letters.",

Go away for asceticism and refrainment. To you I complain, O gazelle of humans... What is in me of loneliness after intimacy. O you whose face is my crescent and my sun...

It was said he weakened, his body wasted, his mind went, he cut off from his brothers, and stuck to the bed. Hassan bin Muhammad bin Isa said: I attended him visiting with a group of his companions. He said: 'Am I not your companion of old association with you? Is there no one among you who will aid me with a look at the face of Amr?' He said: So we went all of us to Amr and said to him: 'If the killing of this man is our religion, then reviving him is chivalry.' He said: 'What happened to him?' We said: 'He has reached a state we do not think you will catch him.' He said: So he put on his clothes and rose with us. When we entered upon him and Amr greeted him, he took his hand and said: 'How do you find yourself, O my master?' He looked at him then fainted. Then he woke up saying: 'I am in health except... From longing for you. O visitor, what is in me... From you is not hidden from you. Do not visit a body and visit a heart... Pledged in your hands. How does one shot... With the arrows of your eyes not perish?' Then he gasped and departed the world in it. We did not leave until we buried him, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him.\nAmong them is a slain one. The Allama Abu al-Qasim Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman al-Shirazi said in the book 'Rawdat al-Qulub wa Nuzhat al-Muhibb wal-Mahbub': I witnessed a woman who was from the people of Shiraz who married a Persian soldier. She found intense passion for him such that she could not bear patience from him for a moment. If he walked to his shift at the Citadel, she would wrap herself and remain standing opposite him until he left. If he entered upon her, he played with her and kissed her, so some of what she found would subside. He entered upon her one day angry from words that passed between him and his commander. When he entered, she wanted the habit from him, but he did not pay attention to her. She thought that was for a reason that happened from her, so she was frightened and panicked. He stayed an hour away from her not raising a glance to her, so imagination strengthened in her. When he went out, she went out behind him as was her habit. He scolded her, so she did not doubt that his anger was because of her. She returned, put a rope around her neck, tied it to the ceiling, strangled herself with it, and died.\nAmong them is a martyr. Al-Wada'i said: Emir Shihab al-Din Ahmad al-Uqayli recounted that Sharaf al-Ula loved a Christian boy and exposed himself in him until he wore haircloth and dressed in the garb of monks, following the boy wherever he went. It happened that King Al-Zahir Salah al-Din heard of his state. While he was hunting in the environs of Aleppo, it was said to him that Sharaf al-Ula was in this land. He sent for him to bring him in his condition. When he attended, and the Sultan was in a drinking gathering, he said to some of his boon companions: 'Fill a large cup and throw Sharaf al-Ula into it (or give it to him).' When he saw the cup, he took it with his hand, drank it, and recited immediately, improvising, addressing King Al-Zahir: 'You gathered my reunion with the cup... So may Allah gather your reunion.",

    "text": "By the right of your head, let me... Until I kiss your sandal.'\nAmong them is a slain one, and it is something my eyes saw, my ears heard, and my heart retained. That is that when I was in Damascus in the year seven hundred and fifty-two, it happened that a youth from the sons of Damascus, beautiful of form, assaulted a person who loved him and killed him. He was carried to the Wali (Governor). When he asked him, he denied. He stripped him to beat him with whips. A person who loved that youth stepped forward and said to the Wali: 'Do not beat him, for he did not kill him, but I killed him.' The Wali brought witnesses and wrote a report against him of his confession to the killing, and released the youth. Aytamish was the Deputy of Damascus that day. When I told him this story and he looked into its interior, he paused regarding his killing and ordered his imprisonment. Only a few days passed until Arghun al-Kamili arrived from Aleppo replacing Aytamish in his deputyship in Damascus. The first thing he judged in blood cases was the hanging of that poor lover according to the report written against him. I saw him under the Citadel while he was hanged, and people around him were regretting for him, mentioning his story, and wondering at it. I told this story to Judge Kamal al-Din bin al-Nahhas, and he wondered at it. He told me on the authority of Judge Zayn al-Din bin al-Saffah and his brother Judge Shams and a group of the people of Aleppo present now, that they told him that Nasir al-Din Muhammad bin Yaktub, one of the scribes of the Mansub (script), known as Al-Qalandari, used to love a female singer whose Zarmuza (shoe) never left him, in a satin silk bag hung on his neck under his clothes. If he attended a gathering and her presence in it did not happen, he took out the Zarmuza from the bag, placed it before him, and began to weep. If intense weeping did not happen for him, he recited: 'Let the eye of a lover not enjoy what... Pleases it if it does not shed tears. Over a beloved, his soul perished... From hardships, and he did not burn.' When he read it, he could not control himself out of fear and panic. His left eye aided him (with tears) but his right did not. He swore not to look with it as long as he lived in the world if it did not aid him with weeping over his beloved. It is stronger in sensation than the left. So he was called Al-Sabir (The Patient/One-eyed?).\nI said: Among the strange things told is that Nasir al-Din al-Qalandari mentioned previously used to place the inkwell in his left hand and the volume of the book on his forearm, and write from it while singing and striking the ground with his foot. He wrote in this state whatever he wished without mistake or grammatical error. Some who wrote about him told me that among the strange things he witnessed of his state is that he used to love a youth from the sons of the soldiers in Tripoli; he used to write about him. The last thing he recited as a proverb and died after it in the year seven hundred and thirty-five is the saying of Al-Sahib bin Abbad: 'O you to whom I gifted my soul so he tortured it... And I intended its release from him but could not. Overtake a remnant of a soul in you that has perished... Before death, for this is the last breath.'\nI said: Let this be what the choice fell upon, and by which desires became pleasant for Ibn Abi Hajalah when he landed in Egypt. How not, when I have landed from it upon the Expert, and brought from the news of those whom Allah forgave us and them with the large multitude? Its martyrs are among the notables of the scenes, and its slain ones, even if the causes of their death differed, their ransom is one. In that, praise be to Allah, is sufficiency, even if the explanation fell short, unintentionally, of the goal. However, in my journey 'Nashr al-Alamayn fi Ziyarat al-Haramayn' is what is like the stone of the ring to this conclusion, and the great waves to these crashing seas. No wonder I did not mention of the news of the people of Hijaz except what this book pointed to with the fingertip of its statement, and began from its paper and pen on the pages of its face and the slips of its tongue. How many in the mentioned Journey, in the mention of those who died in this form, of the news of an enslaved one who was prevented from his slumber and became drowned in the clouds of his tears? 'At the Samura trees of the tribe is a lightning conversing with him... Reminding him at the Thagh (frontier/mouth) what he remembers. ? By his mention the covenant of Al-Udhayb and what it contained... Upon Hajir, his eye sockets flowed on it. Whenever the Yemeni lightning appeared to his eye... A cloud watered the slope from the tail of Al-Muqattam. So how many a lover in it, and his passion... My night lengthened in his love, and if he wishes... So oh for Udhri love, what is the excuse when... He sobered up, and he did not sober up who lost his mind in love? Does what I encounter cool down, O my neighbor... While I attempt union from him every hour? Were he not a Sultan of Beauty, he would not travel... He is generous to them when his steed travels. Were it not for him, the Prince of Lovers would not have executed... And were it not for the attack of the Sultan in Egypt, he would not have walked. He is Al-Nasir the Victorious and the Just who... Has in the path of Allah the best provision. And his antidote in the frontier is the scorpion of his arrows... May Allah reward him for Egypt what he is worthy of. A steed, graces became near with us... It did not fault him that the soldiers are leading horses for him. From the whiteness of morning and the night is black...'",
