To whom Allah the Generous addressed in the Wise Remembrance saying: {And indeed, you are of a great moral character} [Al-Qalam: 4]. And He said regarding His support for His religion: {It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although those who associate others with Allah dislike it} [At-Tawbah: 33]. May Allah send peace and blessings upon him, and elevate his station with Him, and upon his brethren, his relatives, his chosen companions, his followers, and peace be upon him and them all until the Day of Judgment... To proceed, Allah has guided us through His Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and brought us out through him from darkness into light, and granted us the goodness of this world and the Hereafter through the blessing of his message and the prosperity of his ambassadorship. He held a supreme status with his Lord. In the Mighty Book of Allah, there are many verses articulating his beautiful mention, peace be upon him, enumerating his virtues, magnifying his affair, and highlighting his worth. Among that is His saying, Glory be to Him: {O Prophet, indeed We have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner (45) And one who invites to Allah, by His permission, and an illuminating lamp} [Al-Ahzab: 45-46]. Glory be to Him, He has gathered for him in this verse various ranks of preference and a sum of descriptions",

The Almighty says: {That you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you} [Al-Baqarah: 143]. He is a bearer of glad tidings for those who obey him, a warner for those who disobey him, a caller to His oneness and worship, and an illuminating lamp by which light is sought in the darkness of ignorance and misguidance, and by whose lights one is guided to the paths of righteousness and guidance. His Lord described him with this verse in the Torah, with an addition: «A sanctuary for the illiterates (1), you are My servant and My Messenger, I have named you Al-Mutawakkil (The Reliant). He is not rude, nor harsh, nor loud (2) in the markets. He does not repel evil with evil, but he pardons and forgives. Allah will not take his soul until he straightens the crooked religion by them saying 'La ilaha illa Allah' (There is no god but Allah), opening thereby blind eyes, deaf ears, and wrapped hearts». Indeed, among his virtues with Allah is that He made obedience to him obedience to Allah, saying: {He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah} [An-Nisa: 80]. And his Lord swore by the life of His Messenger, peace be upon him—and Glory be to Him, He may swear by whatever He wills of His creation, but that is not for any of them to do. Ibn Abbas says: «Allah did not create, nor originate, nor form a soul more honorable to Him than Muhammad, peace be upon him. I never heard Allah swear by the life of anyone other than him. The Almighty said: {By your life, [O Muhammad], indeed they were, in their",

Surah Ad-Dhuha contains five aspects of Allah's honoring of Muhammad, peace be upon him, highlighting his mention, and magnifying him: First: Swearing to him about what He informed him regarding his state in His saying: {By the morning brightness (1) And [by] the night when it covers with darkness} [Ad-Dhuha: 1-2], meaning: By the Lord of the morning brightness, and this is among the highest degrees of kindness... Second: Clarifying his status with Him and his favor in His sight by saying: {Your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Muhammad], nor has He detested [you]} [Ad-Dhuha: 3], meaning: He has not abandoned you nor hated you after He chose you and loved you... Third: {And the Hereafter is better for you than the first [life]} [Ad-Dhuha: 4], meaning: Every later state of yours has superiority over the previous state. Thus, he, peace be upon him, continued to ascend in the degrees of loftiness, his religion was established for him, he was supported against his enemies, and he was guided in his affairs until he died. He reached a state of virtues, blessings, delight of the eye, and joy of the heart that neither the first nor the last have reached. Then after this, do not ask about his condition in the Hereafter regarding the details of honor and types of bounty, for indeed his Lord bestowed Al-Kawthar upon him... Fourth: {And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied} [Ad-Dhuha: 5].

(6) And He found you lost and guided [you]? (7) And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient?} [Ad-Dhuha: 6-8]. Glory be to Him, He praised his character saying: {And indeed, you are of a great moral character} [Al-Qalam: 4]. He praised his sight saying: {The sight [of the Prophet] did not swerve, nor did it transgress [its limit]} [An-Najm: 17]. He praised his speech saying: {Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination (3) It is not but a revelation revealed} [An-Najm: 3-4]. He raised his mention so that He is not mentioned except that he (the Prophet) is mentioned with Him, as in the Adhan (call to prayer), the Tashahhud, sermons, gatherings, and festivals; that is His saying: {And We raised high for you your repute} [Ash-Sharh: 4]. He is the owner of Al-Wasila (1), Al-Fadila (2), the Praiseworthy Station (Al-Maqam Al-Mahmud) (3), the Visited Pond (Al-Hawd), and the Banner of Praise under which every praiser will be. He is the most honored of Allah's creation to Him, and the Master of the Children of Adam. All of this is but a drop in the ocean and a little of the abundance of his virtue, peace be upon him. Since Allah has obligated us to honor him, support him in every way {That you [people] may believe in Allah and His Messenger and honor him and respect him} [Al-Fath: 9], to prefer him with our lives and wealth in every situation, and to guard and protect him from every harm—even though Allah has sufficed His Messenger from the support of",

And know—may Allah enlighten your heart and mine, and multiply my love and your love for this noble Prophet—that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, has great rights upon you, including: 1 - {So believe in Allah and His Messenger}. It is obligatory upon every believer to believe in him, peace be upon him, and to verify what he brought. This is the meaning of the testimony that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah: Obeying him in what he commanded, believing him in what he informed, avoiding what he forbade and prohibited, and that Allah is not worshipped except by what he prescribed... Sheikh Al-Islam says in Majmoo' Al-Fatawa: \"It is obligatory upon creation to acknowledge what the Prophet, peace be upon him, brought. Whatever the Mighty Quran or the instructive Sunnah brought, it is obligatory upon creation to acknowledge it generally, and specifically when known in detail. A man is not a believer until he acknowledges what the Prophet, peace be upon him, brought.

Thus, one singles him out for judgment, submission, compliance, and obedience, just as one singles out the Sender, Glory be to Him, for worship, humility, submissiveness, repentance, and reliance.\" The command to believe in the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, has been repeated, and indeed paired with belief in Allah. The Almighty says: {Believe in Allah and His Messenger and spend out of that in which He has made you successors. For those who have believed among you and spent, there will be a great reward (7) And why do you not believe in Allah while the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord and He has taken your covenant, if you should be believers?} [Al-Hadid: 7-8]. So the Lord made belief in His Messenger, peace be upon him, and what he invites to, a condition for belief in Him. How could it be otherwise when He supported him with clear signs indicating the truth of what he brought? Hence, following this verse came: {It is He who sends down upon His Servant verses of clear evidence} [Al-Hadid: 9]. And Glory be to Him, He said: {The believers are only the ones who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their properties and their lives in the cause of Allah.

Ponder the restriction of faith using the restrictive particle {innama} (only) to those who believed in Allah and His Messenger, then did not doubt or waver, but remained firm on a single state which is pure belief. Then came the expenditure of wealth and self in the path of Allah. The reward was that He pointed to them with {ula'ika} (those), indicating the loftiness of their rank and reward, followed by the commendation {they are the truthful}, meaning those whose actions verified their words... Indeed, Allah judged with disbelief those who do not believe in His Messenger and warned them of His Blaze, saying: {And whoever has not believed in Allah and His Messenger - then indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers a Blaze} [Al-Fath: 13]. Muslim (1) narrated from the hadith of Abu Huraira that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: «By the One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no one from this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me and then dies without believing in what I was sent with, except that he will be among the companions of the Fire»... He also narrated (2) that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: «I have been commanded to fight the people until they testify that there is no god but Allah and believe in what I have brought.

Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said: «When the Prophet was taken on the Night Journey to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa, people began talking about it in the morning. Some people who had believed in him and affirmed him apostatized. They went with this news to Abu Bakr and said: 'Do you know what your companion is up to? He claims he was taken by night to Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) last night.' He said: 'Or did he say that?' They said: 'Yes!' He said: 'If he said that, then he has spoken the truth.' They said: 'Do you believe that he went last night to Bayt Al-Maqdis and came back before morning?!' He said: 'Yes, I believe him in what is further than that; I believe him regarding the news of the heavens in the morning or evening.' Therefore, he was named Al-Siddiq». Narrated by Al-Hakim (1) and authenticated by Al-Albani (2). Among the subtleties of this chapter indicating the illustrious status of the two Sheikhs (Abu Bakr and Umar) is that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to his companions: «While a shepherd was with his sheep, a wolf attacked and took a sheep. He pursued it until he rescued it. The wolf turned to him and said: 'Who will protect it on the day of the beasts of prey, when it has no shepherd but me?!' And while a man was driving a cow that he had placed a load upon, it turned to him and spoke, saying: 'I was not created for this, but I was",

Narrated by Al-Bukhari (1)... And observe—may Allah have mercy on you—the extent of faith in the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, among the Companions and the degree of verification, in what Muslim narrated (2) from the hadith of Nawwas bin Sam'an in the story of the False Messiah (Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal), wherein it says: «He will emerge from a road between the Levant and Iraq, spreading corruption to the right and left. O servants of Allah, stand firm. We said: O Messenger of Allah, how long will he stay on earth? He said: Forty days; a day like a year, a day like a month, a day like a week, and the rest of his days like your days. We said: O Messenger of Allah, regarding that day which is like a year, will the prayers of one day suffice us in it? He said: No; estimate the time for it». Here he is, peace be upon him, informing them of the length of a day in the time of Dajjal such that it becomes like a year, yet his companions ask only about the prayer. This is due solely to the swiftness of their response and the firmness of their virtue—and no wonder, for they are those whom their Lord purified... And on the Day of the Confederates (Ahzab), when ranks were distinguished into three categories with no fourth: either a pure believer, a disbeliever declaring his disbelief, or a hypocrite revealing the wickedness of his inner self.

Sheikh Al-Islam says: «Allah commanded obedience to His Messenger, peace be upon him, in more than thirty places in the Quran.

Among the verses most indicative of the obligation of submitting to his judgment, peace be upon him, and complying with him is His saying: {But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission} [An-Nisa: 65]. In this verse, Glory be to Him, He swore by the greatest object of oath—Himself, Mighty and Majestic—that faith is not established for them, nor are they among its people, until they make the Messenger of Allah judge in all matters of dispute and in all chapters of religion, for the term 'ma' (that over which) is a form of generality. The command was not limited to mere arbitration, but He added to it the openness of their chests to his judgment, such that they find within themselves no discomfort—tightness—from his judgment. Rather, they accept his judgment with openness and meet it with submission, not taking it grudgingly or swallowing it with difficulty, for that is contrary to faith. Then, Glory be to Him, He did not stop at that until He added His saying: {and submit in [full, willing] submission}. He mentioned the verb emphasized by its infinitive (masdar) based on repeating its mention, which is submission, humility, and compliance willingly and contentedly, submitting not out of coercion or endurance as the conquered submits to the conqueror against his will.

    "text": "Loving Allah and His Messenger is of two degrees: Obligatory love, which is the degree of the economical (Al-Muqtasideen), requiring that Allah and His Messenger be more beloved to him than anything else, such that he does not hate anything He hates, but loves everything Allah and His Messenger obligated, and hates what Allah and His Messenger forbade. Allah Almighty says: {That is because they followed what angered Allah and disliked [what earns] His pleasure, so He rendered worthless their deeds} [Muhammad: 28]. As for Recommended love, which is the degree of the foremost (Al-Sabiqeen), it is by loving what Allah loves of voluntary deeds and virtues with a complete love. This is the state of those brought near (Al-Muqarrabeen) whom Allah has drawn close to Him—may Allah make me and you among them (1)... People are divided regarding the love of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, into three sections: - People of excess, people of negligence, and a middle path between them. Thus Allah made the nation of Muhammad a middle nation... As for the first of them, they are those who innovated matters that Allah and His Messenger did not prescribe, thinking that doing these things is the sign and proof of love. They forgot His saying: {So follow me, [so] Allah will love you}. So they celebrated his birthday (Mawlid)—and if it were",

Out of kindness, then say, 'O slip of the foot'\" (1). They busied themselves with memorizing prophetic eulogies instead of preserving his Sunnah, so the people [of Truth] walked while they stopped, and the people arrived while they were cut off. The situation reached the point with some of them that they started invoking the Messenger of Allah instead of Allah, swearing by him, and wiping themselves on the chamber containing his grave, along with other acts of Shirk done under the claim of loving the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, while they are contrary to it and far from it... As for the negligent one, he is the one who did not observe the right of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, regarding the obligation of prioritizing his love over the love of self, family, and wealth... He did not honor him, revere him, obey his command, or follow his Sunnah. That is only due to his sin, drowning in the desires of his self, and prioritizing his whims over what came in the law of his Lord. Then he believed the ignorance of",

He said: By Allah, he was more beloved to us than our wealth, our children, our fathers, our mothers, and than cold water upon thirst (1)... Abu Sufyan bin Harb—while he was still a polytheist then—asked Zaid bin Al-Dathinah, may Allah be pleased with him, when the people of Mecca took him out of the Sanctuary to kill him: \"I ask you by Allah, O Zaid, would you love that Muhammad was now in your place for us to strike his neck, and that you were with your family?\" He said: \"By Allah, I would not love that Muhammad is in his place where he is now, being pricked by a thorn that hurts him, while I am sitting with my family.\" Abu Sufyan said: \"I have not seen anyone among people love someone like the companions of Muhammad love Muhammad\" (2)...

Your Lord has commanded you to send blessings and peace upon the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, with a command He began with Himself, then seconded with His angels, so comply with His command. The Almighty says: {Indeed, Allah confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allah to grant him] peace} [Al-Ahzab: 56]. Indeed, Allah multiplied the reward of the one who prays upon His Messenger and increased his recompense. Al-Tabarani narrated in Al-Kabir (1) from the hadith of Abu Burdah bin Dinar who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: «No servant from my nation sends blessings upon me, being sincere in it from his heart, except that Allah sends blessings upon him ten times for it, raises him ten degrees by it, writes for him ten good deeds by it, and erases from him ten bad deeds by it».

He says in it: 'Prayer (Salah) upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, from the servant is a supplication. The supplication of the servant and his request from his Lord are of two types: The first: Asking for his own needs, important matters, and what befalls him day and night. This is a supplication and request preferring the beloved of the servant and his desire... The second: Asking Him to praise His Khalil (Friend) and Beloved, and to increase his honor and nobility. There is no doubt that Allah Almighty loves this, and His Messenger loves it. Thus, the one praying upon him has directed his request, desire, and petition towards what Allah and His Messenger love, preferring that over his own requests for his needs and desires. He has preferred what Allah and His Messenger love over what he himself loves. The reward is of the same nature as the deed; so whoever prefers Allah over others, Allah will prefer him over others.'",

So he came out to him and embraced him. Jabir said to him: A hadith reached me that you heard from the Messenger of Allah regarding grievances (Mazalim) which I did not hear. I feared that I might die or you might die before I hear it. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'Allah will gather the servants naked, uncircumcised...' Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him, traveled from Medina to Uqbah bin Amir, may Allah be pleased with them both, while he was in Egypt, to narrate from him a hadith that no one remained who had heard it from the Messenger of Allah except him. It is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: 'Whoever conceals a Muslim, Allah will conceal him on the Day of Resurrection' (1). Saeed bin al-Musayyib said: 'I used to travel for days and nights seeking a single Hadith.' O noble one, look at the loftiness of their ambition in seeking knowledge, how they traveled nights and days for one Hadith, and compare between them and your ambition. Books are to your right and left, and Hadith lessons come to your house, so until when will you turn away from seeking and occupy yourself from memorizing the Sunan?!!",

But Allah is Forgiving and Merciful}. The first etiquette: Prohibition of advancing before him with speech until he gives permission. For this reason, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to ask the Companions about the day they were in, and the place they were in, while they knew it perfectly well, yet they refrained from answering except by saying: 'Allah and His Messenger know best,' fearing that their speech might be advancing before Allah and His Messenger.

Look how Allah paired harming His Messenger with harming Himself. Whoever harms him has harmed Allah, and whoever harms Allah has disbelieved. Reflect on His differentiation, Glory be to Him, between harming Allah and His Messenger and harming the believers; He assigned slander and manifest sin to the latter, while assigning the curse in this world and the Hereafter and humiliating punishment to the former.

Malik was asked about Ayyub al-Sakhtiyani, and he said: 'I have not narrated to you from anyone except that Ayyub is more trustworthy than him.' Malik said: 'He performed Hajj twice, and I used to observe him and did not hear from him, except that when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was mentioned, he wept until I felt pity for him. When I saw from him what I saw and his reverence for the Prophet, I wrote from him.' Mus'ab bin Abdullah said: 'When the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was mentioned, Malik's color would change and he would stoop until it became difficult for those sitting with him. He was asked one day about that, and he said: If you saw what I saw, you would not reject what you see from me' (2). Abdul Rahman bin Al-Qasim used to mention the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and one would look at his color as if blood had been drained from him, and his tongue had dried in his mouth, out of awe for the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. He used to come to Amir bin Abdullah bin Al-Zubair, and if the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was mentioned in his presence, he would weep until no tear remained in his eyes. 'Weeping drained the tears of your eye, so borrow... An eye from another whose tears are abundant.'",

Reverence was not limited to humans only; animals had great etiquette with him, peace and blessings be upon him. From Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: 'The family of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, had a wild beast. When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, went out, it would play and run back and forth. But when it sensed the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, it would enter its resting place (Rabada) and not make a sound as long as the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was in the house, disliking to annoy him.' Narrated by Ahmad (2) and Ibn Kathir authenticated its chain (3). From Safinah, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'I rode the sea, and the ship I was in broke apart. I rode a plank from its planks, and the plank threw me into a thicket containing a lion. It came towards me intending [harm]. I said: O Abu Al-Harith (Lion), I am the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, my affair was such and such. The lion approached, lowered its head, and nudged me with its shoulder until it brought me out of the thicket and placed me on the road. Then it hummed, so I thought it was bidding me farewell.'

It continued to guard him until it guided him... upon safety to the middle of the path.' I have the right to ask after all this: Where are we in relation to the biography of these people?! And where is our state compared to theirs?! There stood in their hearts what our ambitions fall short of performing even the least of, and they revived in their feelings what our feelings die short of. Their sights were attached to what is beyond the glance, while our sights do not go beyond our extremities. Is there no man or woman whose ambition does not sit them down, and whose work does not delay them?? Is there no truthful one who translates love into word, deed, and jealousy??! Otherwise...

And everything that would make the heart a reminder of his right to reverence and support, acknowledging him and obeying him? For the heart is the king of the limbs, and they are its soldiers and followers. So whenever the magnification of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is settled in the heart, inscribed in it through changing conditions, its effects will inevitably appear on the limbs. Then you will find the tongue flowing with his praise and commendation with what he is worthy of, from what his Lord praised him with and what he praised himself with, without exaggeration (Ghaluw) or negligence (Taqsir). Among the greatest praise, peace and blessings be upon him, is the prayer (Salah) upon him. For our prayer upon him implies the praise of the one praying and an indication of mentioning his honor and virtue, and a will from Allah Almighty to elevate his mention (1). From the magnification of the tongue is that we observe etiquette by mentioning him with our tongues, by coupling the mention of his name with the title of Prophethood or Messengership, along with sending prayers and peace upon him. From the magnification of the tongue is memorizing his Sunnah, conveying it, and calling to it. As for the magnification of the limbs, it is acting upon his Sharia, emulating his Sunnah, adopting his commands outwardly and inwardly, judging by what he brought in all matters, being pleased with his judgment and submitting to it, loving and hating for his sake, and striving against those who oppose him...",

    "text": "There remains a message that must—may Allah preserve you—reach you, which is that Allah is the Supporter of His Prophet inevitably, because His saying Almighty is Truth: {If you do not aid him, Allah has already aided him} [Al-Tawbah: 40] and He says {Indeed, We are sufficient for you against the mockers} [Al-Hijr: 95]. No one plotted against the Messenger of Allah except that he was punished with the worst punishment. The biographies are overflowing with the news of Allah's sufficiency for His Messenger; but it is a test from Allah to know who supports Him and His Messengers in the unseen. Reality proves to you the division of people regarding this test into truthful in his love or otherwise... Here are examples I mention to you to comfort your soul, and to reassure your mind of the nearness of Allah's victory for His Prophet and the abundance of reward for you in the truthfulness of your intention and the greatness of your jealousy. Al-Bukhari (1) narrated from the hadith of Anas who said: There was a Christian man who embraced Islam and read Al-Baqarah and Al-Imran, and he used to write for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Then he returned to being a Christian. In Muslim: 'He went off fleeing until he joined the People of the Book, and they raised/honored him.' He used to say: 'Muhammad knows nothing but what I wrote for him.' In Muslim: 'They said: This one used to write for Muhammad, so they were impressed by him.' Allah caused him to die, and they buried him. In the morning, the earth had cast him out. They said: 'This is the deed of Muhammad and his companions; when he fled from them, they dug up our companion and threw him [out].' So they dug for him and dug deep. In the morning, the earth had cast him out. They said: 'This is the deed of Muhammad and his companions; when he fled from them, they dug up our companion and threw him [out].' So they dug for him and dug as deep as they could in the earth. In the morning, the earth had cast him out. So they knew it was not from people, and they left him cast out.' Sheikh al-Islam says: 'So this accursed one who fabricated against the Prophet that he...",

    "text": "...did not know except what was written for him, Allah broke him and exposed him by expelling him from his grave after being buried multiple times. This is a matter outside the norm (supernatural), indicating that this is a punishment for what he said and that he was a liar, since the generality of the dead does not suffer the like of this. And that this crime is greater than apostasy, since the generality of apostates die and do not suffer the like of this. And that Allah takes vengeance for His Messenger from those who attack him and insult him, and exposes the liar if people are unable to establish the Hadd (punishment) upon him' (1). Qadi Iyad (2) mentioned a strange story about a mocker of the Prophet. The jurists of Kairouan and the companions of Sahnun issued a fatwa to kill Ibrahim al-Fazari. He was a poet skilled in many sciences, and he used to mock Allah, His Prophets, and our Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. Judge Yahya bin Umar ordered him to be killed and crucified. He was stabbed with a knife and crucified upside down, then taken down. Some historians narrated that when his wood was raised and hands left it, it turned around and shifted him away from the Qibla. It was a sign for everyone, and the people said Takbir (Allahu Akbar). A dog came and licked his blood.' Indeed, Allah grants victory to His allies over His enemies if the enemies attack our Beloved. Sheikh al-Islam says in 'Al-Sarim Al-Maslul' (3) after mentioning experiences regarding what happens after insulting the Messenger of Allah: 'Similar to this is what...",

    "text": "...numbers of trustworthy Muslims, people of jurisprudence and expertise, told us about what they experienced many times in besieging fortresses and cities on the Levantine coasts when the Romans (Banu al-Asfar) were besieged there in our time. They said: We would besiege the fortress or city for a month or more than a month while it remained impregnable to us, until we almost despaired of it. Then, when its people resorted to insulting the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and attacking his honor, its conquest would hasten and become easy for us. It would hardly delay a day or two or thereabouts, then the place would be opened by force, and a great slaughter would occur among them. They said: We used to rejoice at the hastening of the conquest when we heard them attacking him, despite the hearts being filled with rage at what they said about him.' After what has been presented, I remind you of the obligation of supporting His Prophet; otherwise, if you do not support him, Allah will support him. Your support for the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, is either Repelling (Daf') or Raising/Promoting (Raf'). The first is by teaching people his Sunnah, introducing them to him, and calling them to believe in his message. The second is by defending his noble person, peace and blessings be upon him, and his sayings by distinguishing their authentic from their weak, and refuting the doubts of the falsifiers regarding them. As some ignorant Muslims do by mocking what the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, brought from his Lord of established matters like the Hijab, the beard, raising the Izar (lower garment) above the ankles, and the command to ally with whoever allies with Allah and His Messenger, and oppose whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger...",

    "text": "...Mocking the authentic, established Sunnah is Kufr (disbelief) that expels one from the religion (1). Allah Almighty said: {And if you asked them, they would surely say, \"We were only conversing and playing.\" Say, \"Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?\" (65) Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after your belief. If We pardon one faction of you - We will punish another faction because they were criminals} [Al-Tawbah]. Know—may Allah grant you success—that negligence in defending the Messenger of Allah and his Sharia is a form of abandonment indicating weak faith, or its total disappearance. Whoever claims love but signs of jealousy for his sanctity, honor, and Sunnah do not appear on him is a liar in his claim; for if he were truthful, he would have triumphed/supported. Muhammad bin Al-Murtada said: 'The defender of the Sunnah, the protector of its sanctuary, is like the Mujahid in the path of Allah, preparing for Jihad whatever he can of equipment and strength, as He Glory be to Him said {And prepare against them whatever you are able of power}. It is established in the Sahih that Jibril was with Hassan bin Thabit supporting him as long as he defended the Messenger of Allah in his poetry. Likewise is whoever defends his religion and Sunnah after him out of faith in him, love, and sincerity towards him' (2)...",

Read the Tafsir of Surah Al-Hujurat and the end of Surah Al-Nur, for they contain great etiquette in dealing with the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and his Sunnah.\n2. Resolve to read a book in Prophetic Hadith and another in Prophetic Seerah to know the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, with true knowledge, and what relates to his conditions, days, Sunan, and guidance. I have mentioned to you previously some useful books in this field.\n3. Distribute roles among your family members and your students in your school so that each one of them writes an authentic Hadith from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, every day in a prominent place where a board and pens are allocated for recording the Prophetic Sunnah. In the classroom, the Hadith is written on the side of the board. I have lived this experience with my colleagues, and we found the blessing of its application. No wonder, for serving the Sunnah is an honor.\n4. Let each of us be keen to prepare a lesson in Prophetic Hadith, or the character of the Messenger of Allah, or Seerah, to deliver to his family members, his class students, or his mosque congregation, provided he relies in preparation on books concerned with the authentic Sunnah, filling people's times with the sayings of Allah and the Messenger of Allah...",

Do not hasten to publish a message that comes to you containing a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, unless you verify the authenticity of the Hadith.\n7. Hold a competition in memorizing the Prophetic Sunnah, or set questions around a book in Seerah, and set valuable prizes for the winner.\n8. Bend your knees in the circles of knowledge, especially circles concerned with explaining Hadiths or courses held on Mustalah al-Hadith (Terminology) or Takhrij (Authentication).\n9. Do not let your tongue slacken from constant prayer and peace upon him. Rather, be a key to good and always remind those around you of the virtue of praying upon him. Do not forget to acquire the book 'Jala' al-Afham fi al-Salah wa al-Salam ala Khair al-Anam' by Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah to read it and have it read.\n10. Be keen to issue a periodical. If your soul desires more, then a magazine specialized in Hadiths from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, his conditions, guidance, and sayings, publishing therein what is authentic. If you cannot find a way to that, then publish in magazines, newspapers, and websites what your pen has written and what your ink has been honored with by taking a share in serving his Sunnah, and remember 'Convey from me even if it is a verse.'",
