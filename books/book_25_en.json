So he saw that it was in the interest to punish them by enforcing it upon them; so that they would know that if one of them enacted it all at once, the woman would be irrevocably divorced (Ba'in), and she would be forbidden to him until she marries a husband other than him in a marriage of desire, intended for permanence, not a marriage of legalization (Tahlil); for he was among the strictest of people regarding that.

For Allah only legislated divorce time after time, and did not legislate it all at once. So whoever combined the three in one time has transgressed the limits of Allah, wronged himself, and played with the Book of Allah, so he deserves to be punished and bound to what he committed himself to, and not to be affirmed upon Allah's license and latitude, when he has made it difficult for himself, and did not fear Allah and divorce as Allah commanded him and legislated for him. Rather, he hastened what Allah had granted him a delay in, as a mercy from Him and kindness, but he was not [kind] to himself, and chose the roughest and severest. And this is a rule, which is: «Whoever hastens something before its time, is punished by being deprived of it». This is from the good policy of Umar and his disciplining of his subjects.

And there is no doubt that whoever does this deserves punishment, by having enforced upon him what he enforced upon himself, having not accepted Allah's license, ease, and respite. For this reason, Ibn Abbas said to the one who divorced a hundred times: «You disobeyed your Lord, and your wife has become irrevocably separated from you. You did not fear Allah so that He would make a way out for you. {And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out}». And a man came to him and said: My uncle divorced three times.

These are secrets from the secrets of the Legislation (Shar') and Destiny (Qadar) that do not suit the minds of the people of the time. So the Imams of Islam came following the traces of the Companions, treading their path, seeking the pleasure of Allah and His Messenger, and enforcing His religion. Among them are those who abandoned the saying of the Hadith of Ibn Abbas, thinking it to be abrogated, and this is the method of Al-Shafi'i).

    "text": "the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, Abu Bakr, and two years of the caliphate of Umar: triple divorce was one. So Umar bin Al-Khattab said: The people have hastened in a matter in which they had delay, so what if we enforced it upon them? So he enforced it upon them», and he also narrated it via the path of Ibrahim bin Maysarah from Tawus, similarly). The Imams of Islam have two paths regarding this Hadith: The First: Which is the path of Imam Ahmad and those who agreed with him, and it returns to discussing the chain (Isnad) of the Hadith regarding its anomaly (Shudhudh), and Tawus being solitary in narrating it, and that he was not corroborated in it. The solitariness of a narrator with a Hadith, even if he is trustworthy (Thiqah), is a defect (Illah) in the Hadith that necessitates pausing regarding it, and that it be considered anomalous (Shadh) and objectionable (Munkar) if its meaning is not narrated from a valid perspective. This is the method of the early Imams of Hadith; like Imam Ahmad, Yahya al-Qattan, Yahya bin Ma'in, Ali bin al-Madini, and others. And this Hadith is not narrated from Ibn Abbas by anyone other than Tawus.",

Ahmad and Al-Shafi'i used this as a defect [justification to reject] as mentioned in «Al-Mughni», and this is also a defect in the Hadith by itself, so how about when the defect of anomaly, objectionability, and the consensus of the Ummah is added to it?!».

Third: It is Muhammad bin Thawr al-Saghani: A great trustworthy worshiper, and Muhammad bin Thawr did not mention in his narration that he divorced her three times, but rather said: «I divorced her», and Abd al-Razzaq narrated in the end of his life very objectionable [Hadiths] regarding the virtues of Ahl al-Bayt and dispraising others, and he had an inclination towards Shi'ism, and this ruling is what agrees with the desire of the Shia.

Then Ibn Rajab said after this: (Chapter: It has been inferred that the combined three occur by multiple evidences from the Book and the Sunnah. As for the Book, there are places: First: His saying: {O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them for their waiting period}. Up to His saying: {And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out}. Ibn Abbas deduced from His saying: {And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out} that whoever divorces according to what Allah commanded for the commencement of the waiting period as a revocable divorce and leaves her until her waiting period expires, or takes her back, Allah has made a way out for him, either by taking her back during the waiting period, or marrying her after it without a [intervening] husband or intercourse. But whoever divorces contrary to what Allah commanded, and divorces three times, Allah has not made a relief or a way out for him. This is established from Ibn Abbas. The Second Place: His saying in the context of verses: {And do not take the verses of Allah in jest}. Al-Hasan said: «A man in the time of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to divorce and say: I was playing, and free a slave and say: I was playing, and marry off his son and say: I was playing. So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Three, whoever says them playing, they are binding upon them: Manumission, Divorce, and Marriage.

A group said: It is the third divorce, which is the saying of Mujahid, Qatadah, and others, and Abu Bakr Abd al-Aziz bin Ja'far from our companions chose it. The second saying in the verse: That the meaning of releasing with kindness: clearing her path until her waiting period expires, so he leaves the way open between her and husbands).

Second: What he did not gather the Companions for, but they differed regarding it in his time. This allows for difference of opinion, like the issues of the grandfather with brothers. The Second Division: What has been narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, containing a judgment contrary to Umar's judgment.

This prevents acting upon other than what he chose. Fourth: What was a judgment of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, for a reason (Illah), then the reason ceased, so the judgment ceased by its cessation, or an impediment was found preventing that judgment». He said: «So this issue is either from the second, or from the fourth». He said: «It is not known from the Ummah that anyone differed in this issue with an apparent difference, neither in ruling nor judgment, nor knowledge nor fatwa. And that did not occur except from a very small group, and their contemporaries denied it upon them with the utmost denial. Most of them used to hide that, and not show it. So how can the consensus of the Ummah be on hiding the religion of Allah which He legislated on the tongue of His Messenger, and their following the Ijtihad of the one who opposed him with his opinion in that? believing this is not permissible at all. This Ummah, just as it is infallible from agreeing on error, it is infallible from the people of falsehood among them overcoming the people of truth.

He said in «A'lam al-Muwaqqi'in» and «Al-Huda»: (If the three divorces are combined in one utterance, they are made one, as established in «Sahih Muslim» from Ibn Tawus from his father from Ibn Abbas: «The divorce [of three] during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, Abu Bakr, and two years of Umar's caliphate, was [counted as] one. Then Umar [bin Al-Khattab] said: The people have hastened in a matter in which they had respite; so if we were to enforce it upon them! So he enforced it upon them.» This Hadith is irrefutable; for Muslim narrated it in his «Sahih», and Muslim is committed to authenticity. Even if Ibn Rajab said something about it, it is an error; because it is not odd (shadh), nor denounced (munkar), nor strange (gharib), nor does it contain any denounced narrator; for if it had a defect, it would not be in «Sahih Muslim».

I say: This Hadith also is irrefutable, for Muslim narrated it in his «Sahih». And Allah knows best. And in his «Sahih» from him: «That Abu al-Sahba said to Ibn Abbas: Give us from your information, was not divorce during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and Abu Bakr one? He said: It was so, but when it was Umar's time, people followed each other in divorce [issued it frequently/hastily], so he enforced it upon them.» This Hadith also is irrefutable; due to it being in «Sahih Muslim». These are three authentic Hadiths in «Sahih Muslim»; because Muslim's condition is authenticity, and whoever says otherwise has erred. We have these three Hadiths from «Muslim», so you bring us one Hadith from it or from «Al-Sahih» [Al-Bukhari]. And in the Sunan of Abu Dawood from Tawus: «That a man called Abu al-Sahba used to question Ibn Abbas frequently. He said: Do you not know that if a man divorced his wife thrice before consummating the marriage, they made it one during the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him, Abu Bakr, and the beginning of Umar's emirate? Ibn Abbas said: Indeed, if a man divorced his wife thrice before consummating the marriage, they made it one during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, Abu Bakr, and the beginning of Umar's emirate. When he saw people persisting in it, he said: Enforce them upon them».",

And Allah Almighty said: {And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day}, meaning: otherwise you are not truly believers. The 'Alif' and 'Lam' in His saying: {Al-Talaq (The Divorce) is twice} are for the covenant (Al-'Ahd), and the covenanted [meaning] here is the divorce understood from His saying: {Divorced women remain in waiting for three periods}, which is the revocable (Raj'i) divorce due to His saying: {And their husbands have more right to take them back in that}. So the meaning became: The divorce in which the husband has more right to return is only twice. The return, which was absolute in every instance of divorce, became restricted to only two times of it. It is not known, nor is there a difference in the verse between his saying in each time: 'I divorced you once', or 'three', or 'thirty thousand'. So whoever conceptualizes the meanings of these rulings from the utterances, and Allah wills his guidance, knows that there is an explicit legal text from Allah that the three divorces are one; because these verses do not bear legally other than that according to one who understands the legal text, is fair regarding it, wants Allah to guide him to accept the truth, and removes from his heart desires and partisanship in supporting the Schools or against Ibn Taymiyyah. And the Book of Allah in these verses legally",

He prepares to argue before Allah - the Exalted - if He asks him about what he judged in His religion or among His servants, while he is barefoot, naked, bareheaded, with faults exposed, uncircumcised, his hand tied to his neck. There is nothing in the legislation of Islam indicating that Allah legislated the three divorces at once, neither in wording, nor meaning, nor ruling. Whoever claims this, and does not establish a correct proof for it, has spoken about Allah without knowledge. The verse in «Al-A'raf» indicates that speaking about Allah without knowledge is worse than polytheism (Shirk), which is His saying: {Say, \"My Lord has only forbidden immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed} to His saying: {and that you say about Allah that which you do not know}. That is for one who understands and is fair, and understands the meaning of this noble verse, and the conjunction of part to whole within it, and that the prohibition of speaking about Allah without knowledge is repeated in it by conjunction five times, Shirk four times, oppression without right three times, sin two times, and immorality once».

    "text": "to him}, i.e., if he divorces her a third time, she is not lawful to him afterwards. The understanding from His saying: {Divorce is twice}, does not legally allow other than that. This ruling is specific to it legally; i.e., regarding the prohibition of the divorced woman to him until she marries a husband other than him. It implies that the prohibition is after the first two times, for in each of the first two he has the choice between keeping and releasing by the text of the verse. So the estimation is: If he divorces her a third time, she is not lawful to him; this bears no disagreement». I say: The explicit text of this verse implies that the three are separate [occasions], and Allah knows best. Then he said: «The estimation indicates inevitably that it is not permissible in the verse to say: 'If he divorces her, she is not lawful to him'. It is not permissible for it to be independent by itself, separated from what is before it; because of what that implies of abrogating the legislation of return (Raj'a) in divorce from the religion of Islam, and no one says that. That is because the pronoun of the absolute within it would return to something non-existent in the speech before it, specific to it, distinguished by wisdom. It would then be general for every divorcer and divorced woman, and no one says that. That is because His saying: {And if he divorces her, she is not lawful to him}, is a restricted sentence, and the sentence is indefinite, and it is in the context of a condition and negation, so it would cover every divorcer and divorced woman. This would be abrogating the legislation of return in divorce in the religion of Islam, and no one says that. Thus, it is determined that His saying: {And if he divorces her, she is not lawful to him} is a completion of what is before it; i.e., connected to it, and the pronoun in it refers to an existent in the speech before it, specific to it, distinguished by the ruling of his prohibition in his divorce if he divorces. There is nothing in what is before it suitable for the return of this pronoun to it, and its specification with this ruling of prohibition legally, except the absolute understood from His saying: {Divorce is twice}; because if it returned to the one divorcing in the form of compensation (Khul') mentioned before it, the prohibition would be specific to compensation divorce, and no one says that. And if it returned to the one divorcing in the form of Ila' (oath of abstinence) mentioned",

So it is determined that the pronoun returns to the absolute understood from His saying: {Divorce is twice}, and it is determined for it in the structure of the speech legally. It is not permissible for it to return to other than it legally. The estimation of the speech is: If he divorces her a third time, she is not lawful to him until she marries a husband other than him. It has become clear that the meaning of this speech and its estimation is: That revocable divorce is twice, so if he divorces her after them a third time, she is not lawful to him by it afterwards until she marries a husband other than him. Thus Allah did not legislate prohibition except after the third time of divorce, and the third time is not except after two times legally, linguistically, customarily, and by consensus, except what occurred in this issue by Allah's decree and measure». Then he said: «Chapter: What clarifies and explains the invalidity of their structure legally and linguistically regarding the three divorces and others is that the word of plurality in it is accusative as a verbal noun (Masdar). The estimation of the speech is: I divorced you a divorce. The meaning of the verbal noun in the speech is: I divorced you three divorces. The meaning of the verbal noun in speech is but a narration of the state of the action emanating from the doer. The action has two states in its emanation from the doer: a state where it is news about the occurrence issued from the doer in the past, and a state where it is a tool for what is used in creating contracts and annulments metaphorically or by sharing. If narration and news about the past is intended, if news about the reality of the action and negation of metaphor is intended, it is followed by the verbal noun absolutely. As for if the past tense is used to create a contract or annul a contract, whether it is said: It is by way of metaphor or sharing, if the contract or annulment is intended, the verbal noun follows absolutely; like: I divorced her a divorcing. However, if the plurality of the contract or annulment in one utterance at one time is intended as equivalent to its plurality by repetition time",

As for other than divorce, there is no disagreement in it. As for divorce, the error occurred in it after the Companions». Then he said: «Chapter: It is not in the legislation of Islam that Allah - Glory be to Him - legislated for a man regarding the divorce of his wife three divorces, nor that He forbade her to him by three divorces, such that doubt occurs regarding the permissibility of combining them with such a structure at one time, or that it is not permissible, while divorce is the most hated of lawful things to Allah.

Ask this Billy-goat: Did he ever consider spending, clothing, or paying a dowry? Did the afflicted woman hope for any of that from him? Or did he request a noble child from her, or hope that she would take him as a companion and beloved? Ask the woman: Does she ask about his lineage, wealth, good companionship, or ample spending?

How can the legalization of this be permitted in law? This has never been permitted in any religion, and none of the Companions did it, nor gave a fatwa for it. So Umar enforced the three if they combined them, so that they would refrain from it, if they knew that the woman would be forbidden by it, and that there is no way for her return except by legalization. But when the times changed, and the era became distant from the Sunnah and the traditions of the people, and the market of legalization became established and popular among the people, it became obligatory to return the matter to what it was in the time of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and his Caliph, by issuing fatwas that disrupt the market of legalization or reduce it and lighten its evil.

And the texts prohibit legalization (Tahlil), explicitly cursing the doer, and there are very many Hadiths regarding it. The Predecessors (Salaf) are agreed upon it, and the consensus is that it is forbidden. Then during the time of Umar, it became: Three is three, and legalization is prohibited, and Umar was among the strictest of Companions regarding it, and all of them were upon his saying regarding it. Then in these times, legalization became frequent and famous, and three is three. Based on this, it is impossible in these times to punish people with the punishment of Umar for two reasons: First: Most of them do not know that combining three is forbidden, especially since many jurists do not see its prohibition, so how can one be punished who did not commit what he considers forbidden? Second: Punishing them with that opens upon them the door of legalization which was closed during the time of the Companions. And if punishment implies a corruption greater than the act being punished, leaving it is more beloved to Allah and His Messenger. Even if we assume that legalization is something the Sharia permitted—and Allah forbid—prohibiting it when it reaches this extent of obscene ugliness would be from the chapter of blocking the means (Sadd al-Dhara'i), and it would be incumbent upon Muftis and Judges to prohibit it entirely, even if it is assumed that some individual cases are permissible; for no one doubts that returning to what the Companions were upon during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, Abu Bakr, and the beginning",

For this reason, Umar bin Al-Khattab—may Allah the Almighty be pleased with him—declared he should be stoned. Third: That he committed a major sin, and that is feared for him, for whoever commits major sins, it is feared for him that he dies upon other than the religion of Muhammad. Fourth: That the Prophet, the Companions, and the Tabi'in named him a Billy-goat, and a Billy-goat is only used in the context of dispraise, humiliation, and contempt. He was likened to a Billy-goat because the Billy-goat mates with sheep without a contract, dowry, or otherwise, so he was likened to it. And whatever resembles a thing is given its ruling. So he takes without a dowry, and has intercourse with this one and that one without a contract, because the existence and non-existence of the contract are equal to him, and likewise Halal and Haram, and the woman and her daughter, so he was likened to a Billy-goat. Fifth: That he named him a fornicator (Saffah), and the Saffah is like the Billy-goat that mates without a contract or anything else, as was said regarding the Billy-goat, and it is blameworthy from all aspects.\nChapter\nThe one for whom it is legalized (Muhallal lahu) is also cursed and blameworthy with him, because he aided him in this as they said regarding the eater of usury and the one who feeds it; for were it not for this, this one would not have legalized. And the woman is also blameworthy",

For this reason, Umar—may Allah the Almighty be pleased with him—declared they should be stoned; because her ruling is exactly the ruling of the adulteress, so she and he are stoned. And Allah is the Grantor of Success.\nChapter\nSheikh Jamal al-Din the Imam said: «This is a fornicator (Musafih), not a husband, nor a married man according to Sharia. For the marrying husband is only in the manner that Allah legislated and permitted, as He, Glory be to Him, said in the verse of prohibited women in marriage: {Prohibited to you are your mothers and your daughters} the verse, until He said: {Prescribed for you is the Book of Allah. And lawful to you are [all others] beyond these, [provided] that you seek them [in marriage] with your property, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse}. So He, Glory be to Him, made the one seeking with his money one desiring chastity not unlawful intercourse. So whoever is not seeking with his money chastity for himself, is not a husband, nor a married man according to Sharia; he is a fornicator and the cursed Billy-goat in this time». I say: The Hadith indicated that this is fornication (Sifah), as in the previous Hadith: «We used to consider it during the time of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, as fornication». So he is a fornicator. If it is said: The form of marriage and divorce exists in it unlike fornication, it is said: It exists upon deception of Allah and His Messenger, and it only operates with the meaning of hiring, so it is hiring, not true marriage, so it is fornication. And Allah knows best the truth. Ibn Muflih said in «Al-Furu'»: «If the execution of the triple divorce leads to legalization (Tahlil), then abandoning its execution is better than executing it».",

He said: Then you would have disobeyed your Lord, and your wife would be irrevocably separated from you». Al-Daraqutni narrated with his chain from Ali who said: «The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, heard a man divorce his wife absolutely (Al-Battah). He became angry and said: Do you take the signs of Allah in jest—or the religion of Allah in jest and play?—Whoever divorces absolutely, we bind him to three; she is not lawful for him until she marries a husband other than him. And because it is a prohibition of the vulva by the husband's word, so it became forbidden like Zihar. And from him: [It is forbidden] in a state of purity, not purities. He prioritized it in «Al-Furu'» after the first. And from him: It does not prohibit.",

For the Grandfather Jamal al-Din the Imam and Sheikh Taqi al-Din are on one side, and Jamal al-Din authored a book on it being one. And Ibn Rajab is on one side, for he authored a book on its occurrence [as three]. And Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned the two views, but his inclination is towards non-occurrence [as three]. So let the intelligent person choose what necessitates fairness, and choose an answer by which he presents himself to the Lord of the servants, and not choose something out of partisanship and ostentation; for the world is done with, and it is fleeting. So let him take for himself what is good for himself, and let him take an answer by which he stands before Allah, Mighty and Majestic, when he stands bareheaded, naked, uncovered, confused. For the entire world is not worth a penny. And let him be fair where fairness is obligatory, and not speak in issues by his own Ijtihad; for scholars are shepherds over Allah's religion, and the shepherd is responsible",
