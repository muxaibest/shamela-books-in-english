    "text": "Description of the Book Manuscript and Verification of its Attribution. The manuscript of this book is considered one of the very rare manuscripts, and by the grace and generosity of Allah, we were able to find it, so praise and thanks be to Him. This manuscript consists of (6) folios, meaning (12) pages, size 14x19 cm, and the manuscript is located under number (2187), under the code (Hadith) on microfilm (48606). This manuscript reached us with a chain of transmission (Isnad) back to the author, may Allah have mercy on him, and by studying this Isnad as shown at the beginning of the book, we find that the Isnad is authentic to the author. It has been read and heard by eminent scholars throughout ages and times. In the year 668 AH, the virtuous Sheikh Al-Hasan bin Ali Al-Irbili read it to the Sheikh of the era and Imam of his time, Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Khalil, the grandson of Ibn Al-Ajami, who read it to the venerable Sheikh Muhammad bin Abi Umar Al-Maqdisi. And in the year 708 Hijri, other hearings were obtained on it as shown at the end of the book. I have seen the verification of this book after finishing my verification of it by Dr. Muhammad Al-Banna. To proceed: I have attempted to serve this book by verifying its chains of transmission, commenting on them, placing internal titles, providing biographies for its notable figures, and preparing its scientific indexes.",
