    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. In Him is my trust.\nPraise be to Allah, the Possessor of generosity and kindness, the Bestower of blessings and favors. May Allah bless the best of those who walked on foot, the Chosen One sent to all nations, Muhammad bin Abdullah, our savior from error and darkness, and upon his family, companions, and wives, and grant them peace.\nNow then, may Allah prolong your life in grace, improve your deeds with piety, let you reach your hopes in safety, and end your term with righteous deeds. You requested that I collect for you the best reports of the generous and the most sublime and guided deeds of the noble. I sought Allah's guidance in speech and selected what occurred to me at the moment, which I believe will provoke the reader and listener and be highly regarded by them. I composed it into a book which I named 'Al-Mustajad min Fa'alat al-Ajwad' (The Selected Deeds of the Generous), so it would match its title, suit your purpose, and surpass what is considered good. My success is only through Allah; upon Him I rely and to Him I turn.\n\n**Anecdotes of the Generous**\n\n**Anecdote:** It is narrated that Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, slept in the bed of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when Quraysh conspired to kill him, sacrificing himself for him. Allah Almighty revealed to Gabriel and Michael: 'I have established brotherhood between you and made the lifespan of one of you longer than the other. You have the choice: which of you will prefer his companion with life?' Each of them loved life and chose it. Allah revealed to them: 'Why were you not like Ali bin Abi Talib? I established brotherhood between him and My Prophet Muhammad, and he settled in his bed and Ali slept on it, sacrificing himself and preferring him with life. Descend to Earth and protect him from his enemy.' So Gabriel was at his head and Michael at his feet, and Gabriel was calling out: 'Excellent, excellent! Who is like you, O son of Abi Talib? Allah boasts of you to the angels.' Then Allah revealed: (And of the people is he who sells himself, seeking means to the approval of Allah).\n\n**Anecdote:** A man asked Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with them, for a need. He said to him: 'O you, the right of your request to me is great in my eyes, and my knowledge of what is due to you weighs heavily upon me. My hand falls short of giving you what you deserve, and much is little in the essence of Allah. What I own is not enough to repay your gratitude. If you accept the available ease and relieve me of the burden of straining and concern to undertake what is your due, I will do it.' The man said: 'O son of the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, I accept the little, thank the gift, and excuse the withholding.' Al-Hasan called his agent and began accounting him for his expenses until he exhausted them. Then he said: 'Bring the surplus from the three hundred thousand.' He brought fifty thousand. He asked: 'What did you do with the five hundred dinars?' He said: 'They are with me.' He said: 'Bring them.' They were brought, and he gave the dirhams and dinars to the man and said: 'Bring someone to carry them for you.' He brought two porters, and Al-Hasan gave them his cloak as payment for the carrying. His clients said to him: 'By Allah, we do not have a single dirham.' He said: 'But I hope to have a great reward with Allah.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Hasan al-Mada'ini said: Al-Hasan, Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them), and Abdullah bin Ja'far went out for Hajj. Their luggage went ahead of them, so they became hungry and thirsty. They passed by an old woman in a tent of hers. One of them said to her: 'Is there any drink?' She said: 'Yes.' They dismounted at her place. She had nothing but a small sheep in the corner of the tent. She said: 'Milk it and drink its milk mixed with water.' They did so. Then they said to her: 'Is there any food?' She said: 'No, except this sheep. Let one of you slaughter it so I can prepare some of it for you to eat.' One of them stood up, slaughtered and skinned it. Then she prepared food for them, and they ate and stayed until it cooled down. When they departed, they said to her: 'We are a group from Quraysh intending this direction. If we return safely, visit us, for we will do good to you.' Then they departed. Her husband arrived, and she informed him about the people and the sheep. He got angry and said: 'Woe to you! You slaughter my sheep for people you don't know, then say they are a group from Quraysh?'",

    "text": "Then after some time, need drove them to enter Medina. They entered it and began transporting dung and selling it, living off its price. The old woman passed through some of the alleys of Medina and saw Al-Hasan bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, sitting at the door of his house. He recognized the old woman, but she did not recognize him. He sent his servant to her, called her, and said: 'O maidservant of Allah, do you know me?' She said: 'No.' He said: 'I was your guest on such and such day.' She said: 'By my father and mother, you are he!' He then ordered that a thousand sheep from the charity sheep be bought for her, and he ordered a thousand dinars for her with them. He sent her with his servant to Al-Husayn, may Allah be pleased with him. Al-Husayn asked her: 'How much did my brother give you?' She said: 'A thousand sheep and a thousand dinars.' So Al-Husayn ordered the like for her. Then he sent her with his servant to Abdullah bin Ja'far. He asked her: 'How much did Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn give you?' She said: 'Two thousand sheep and two thousand dinars.' Abdullah ordered two thousand sheep and two thousand dinars for her, and said to her: 'If you had started with me, I would have exhausted them (i.e., given more to outdo them).' The old woman returned to her husband with four thousand dinars and four thousand sheep.\n\n**Anecdote:** From Muhammad bin al-Munkadir from Umm Dharrah, who used to serve Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. She said: Ibn al-Zubayr sent her money in two sacks, totaling one hundred and eighty thousand. She called for a tray and began distributing it among the people until it was finished. When evening came, she said: 'O girl, bring my breakfast (to break fast).' She brought her bread and oil. Umm Dharrah said to her: 'Could you not, from what you distributed today, buy us meat for a dirham to break our fast with?' She said: 'If you had reminded me, I would have done so.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Mus'ab bin al-Zubayr said: Muawiyah performed Hajj. When he departed, he passed by Medina. Al-Husayn bin Ali said to his brother Al-Hasan, may Allah be pleased with them: 'Do not meet him or greet him.' When Muawiyah left, Al-Hasan said: 'O brother, we have a debt, and we must go to him.' He caught up with him at Thaniyat al-Nawl, while he was descending into the valley. He greeted him and informed him of his debt. He ordered eighty thousand dinars to be poured out for him. He [the camel carrying it] had become tired and lagged behind the camels, with people driving it. Muawiyah said: 'What is this?' It was mentioned to him. He said: 'Send it with what is on it to Abu Muhammad.' So he took it and returned.\n\n**Anecdote:** The Quran readers of Basra gathered to Ibn Abbas while he was the governor of Basra. They said: 'We have a neighbor who fasts and prays excessively; each of us wishes to be like him. He has married his daughter to his nephew, and he is poor and has nothing to equip her with.' Abdullah bin Abbas stood up, took their hands, led them into his house, opened a chest, and took out six bags of money. Then he said: 'Carry.' So they carried them. Ibn Abbas said: 'We have not treated him fairly; we have given him what will distract him from his fasting and praying. Return, so we can be his assistants in equipping her. The world does not have enough value to distract a believer from worshipping his Lord Almighty, and we do not have such pride that we would not serve the allies of Allah Almighty.' So he did, and they did.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is narrated that Uthman had a claim of fifty thousand dirhams against Talha. Uthman went out to the mosque one day, and Talha said to him: 'Your money is ready, so take it.' He said: 'It is yours, O Abu Muhammad, as an aid to your virtue.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Sa'da bint Awf said: I entered upon Talha bin Ubaydullah and saw heaviness in him. I said: 'What is wrong with you?' He said: 'Money has accumulated with me, causing me distress and grief.' I said: 'What grieves you? Call your people and distribute it among them.' He said: 'O boy, call my people.' He distributed it among them. I asked the servant: 'How much was it?' He said: 'Four hundred thousand.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Harith al-Muhasibi said: We were informed that a caravan arrived from Yemen for Abd al-Rahman bin Awf. Medina buzzed with a single noise. Aisha said: 'What is this?' She was told: 'A caravan arrived for Abd al-Rahman.' She said: 'Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.' This reached Abd al-Rahman, so he asked her. She said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: \"I saw Paradise, and I saw the poor of the Emigrants and Muslims entering it running, but I did not see any of the rich entering it with them except crawling.\"' Abd al-Rahman said: 'The caravan and what is on it is for the sake of Allah, and its slaves are free; perhaps I may enter it with them running.'\n\n**Anecdote:** From Aban bin Uthman, who said: A man wanted to harm Ubaydullah bin Abbas, so he went to the notables of Quraysh and said to them: 'Abdullah says to you: Have lunch with me today.' They came to him until they filled his house. Abdullah said: 'What is this?' He was informed of the news. He ordered fruit to be bought and ordered people to cook and bake. The fruit was presented to them, and before they finished it, the tables were set. They ate until they left. Ubaydullah said to his agents: 'Is something like this available whenever I want?' They said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Then let these people have lunch with us every day.'",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** It is told that when people suffered a famine in Egypt while Abd al-Hamid bin Sa'd was their emir, he said: 'By Allah, I will teach Satan that I am his enemy.' He aided their needy, opened the storehouses, and spent them until prices dropped. Then he was dismissed from them and departed. He owed merchants one million dirhams, for which he pawned his women's jewelry, the value of which was five million dirhams. When he was unable to retrieve it, he wrote to them to sell it and give the surplus to those whom his charity had not reached.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that Abdullah bin Amir bin Kurayz left the mosque wanting his home, alone. A boy from Thaqif stood up to him and walked by his side. Abdullah said to him: 'Do you have a need, O boy?' He said: 'Your well-being and success. I saw you walking alone, so I said I would protect you with myself, and I seek refuge in Allah lest any harm touch you.' Abdullah took his hand and walked with him to his house. Then he called for a thousand dinars, gave them to the boy, and said: 'Spend this, for excellent is the manner your family taught you.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Abdullah bin Amir bought from Khalid bin Uqba bin Abi Mu'ayt his house in the market for ninety thousand dirhams. When night came, he heard the weeping of Khalid's family. He said to his family: 'What is wrong with them?' They said: 'They are weeping for their house which you bought.' He said: 'O boy, go to them and inform them that the house and the money are all theirs.'\n\n**Anecdote:** It is narrated that Abdullah bin Ja'far went out to a farm of his. He stopped at a palm grove belonging to some people, where there was a black slave tending to it. His daily food provision of three loaves was brought to him. A dog entered and approached the slave. He threw a loaf to it, and it ate it. He threw the second to it, and it ate it. Then the third, and it ate it. Abdullah was looking at him and said: 'O boy, how much is your provision every day?' He said: 'What you saw.' He said: 'Why did you prefer this dog?' He said: 'This is not a land of dogs, and I reckon it came from a far distance hungry, so I hated to turn it away.' He said: 'So what will you do today?' He said: 'I will fast this day of mine.' Abdullah bin Ja'far said: 'Am I blamed for generosity while this one is more generous than me?' He bought the garden, the slave, and the tools in it, freed the slave, and gifted it all to him.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that words were exchanged between Al-Husayn bin Ali and his brother Muhammad bin al-Hanafiya, and they departed angry with each other. When Muhammad reached his home, he took a piece of paper and wrote in it: 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad bin Ali bin Abi Talib to Al-Husayn bin Ali bin Abi Talib. Now then, you have an honor I cannot reach, and a virtue I cannot attain. If you read this letter of mine, put on your cloak and shoes and come to me to reconcile with me. Beware lest I precede you to the deed of which you are more worthy than I. Peace.' He said: When Al-Husayn read the letter, he said: 'O boy, my cloak and shoes.' He put them on, came to his brother Muhammad, reconciled with him, and made peace. It is said: Words were exchanged between Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, may Allah be pleased with them. It was said to Al-Husayn: 'Why don't you go to your brother apologizing?' He said: 'Virtue belongs to the one who initiates kindness, and I do not see it fitting for me to have virtue over my brother.' Al-Hasan heard of this, so he came to him.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani narrated from Ishaq, said: Mus'ab al-Zubayri narrated to me from Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Abi Mulayka, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: There was a pious man in Medina, a man of knowledge and jurisprudence, who used to visit Abdullah bin Ja'far. One day he heard a singing slave girl belonging to some slave traders singing: \n'Su'ad departed, so her bond was cut... She occupied Al-Ghawr, then Al-Jaddayn, then Al-Far'a.\nShe denied me, and what she denied... of events was nothing but gray hair and baldness.'\nHe became infatuated with her and wandered in love, abandoning his ways until Ata and Tawus walked to him and blamed him. His answer was to quote the poet:\n'People I sit with blame me regarding you... I do not care whether the blame flies or lands.'",

    "text": "This reached Abdullah bin Ja'far, so he sent for the slave trader, inspected the girl, and heard her sing this song. He asked her: 'From whom did you learn it?' She said: 'From Azza al-Mayla.' He bought her for forty thousand dirhams and ordered his head maid to adorn and bedeck her, which she did. Then he sent to the man asking about his condition, informing him of the situation, and verifying the news about him. He said to him: 'Would you like to hear this voice from the one that girl learned it from?' He said: 'Yes.' So he called for Azza al-Mayla and said: 'Sing it to him.' She sang it. The man clapped and fell unconscious. Ibn Ja'far said: 'We have sinned regarding him! Water, water!' He sprinkled water on his face. When he recovered, he said to him: 'Has your love for her reached this extent?' He said: 'What is hidden from you is greater.' He said: 'Would you like to hear it from her?' He said: 'You saw what happened when I heard it from someone else while I do not love her (Azza); how will my state be if I hear it from her (the slave girl) while I cannot possess her?' He said: 'Would you recognize her if you saw her?' He said: 'Would I recognize anyone else?' He ordered her to be brought out. He said: 'Take her, she is yours. By Allah, I have not looked at her with desire.' The man kissed his hands and feet and said: 'You have revived my eye and my soul, let me live among my people, and returned my mind to me.' He prayed for him profusely. Ibn Ja'far said to him: 'Are you satisfied?' He said: 'Yes, by Allah, and above satisfaction.' Ibn Ja'far said: 'I am not content to give her to you like this. O boy, carry with him the like of her price so that you do not worry about her and she does not worry about you.' So he returned with her and the money.",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** Abu Musa Muhammad bin al-Fadl bin Ya'qub, the scribe and executor of Isa bin Ja'far, narrated: My father told me: I used to visit Zaynab bint Sulayman bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas and write down news of her family from her. She had a slave girl named 'Kitab'. She caught my fancy. I went to her early one day and said: 'I have a request.' She said: 'Ask me whatever you like.' I said: 'Kitab, your maid, has occupied my heart against me, so gift her to me.' She said: 'Sit down, I will tell you a story that happened yesterday, more beneficial to you than every 'Kitab' (book/writer) on the face of the earth, and you have a promise regarding Kitab.'\n\nI was with Al-Khayzuran yesterday. Her habit when I was with her was to sit at the threshold of the hallway facing the Iwan, and I would sit opposite her. In the center was Al-Mahdi's sitting place where he would sit; he would visit us at any time, sit for an hour, then leave. While we were like that, one of her chambermaids entered and said: 'May Allah honor the Lady, at the door is a woman of beauty and fine creation, but in the utmost state of poor condition, asking permission to see you. I asked her name, but she refused to tell me.' Al-Khayzuran turned to me and said: 'What do you think?' I said: 'Let her in, for there must be a benefit or reward.' A woman entered, among the most beautiful and perfect of women, unable to hide it. She stood by the side of the doorjamb, greeted humbly, and then said: 'I am Muzna bint Marwan bin Muhammad the Umayyad.'\n\nZaynab said: I was reclining, so I sat up straight and said: 'Muzna! What brought you? No welcome and no proximity to you! Praise be to Allah who removed your blessing, tore your veil, and humiliated you. Do you remember, O enemy of Allah, when the old women of my family came to you asking you to speak to your master (Marwan) to permit the burial of Ibrahim bin Muhammad, and you attacked them and said what you said, and ordered them expelled, so they were expelled in the state they were expelled?' She said: She laughed—I will never forget the beauty of her teeth and the loudness of her laughter—then said: 'O cousin, does the good doing of Allah with me despite my disobedience surprise you, that you wish to follow my example in it? By Allah, I indeed did to the women of your family what I did, so Allah surrendered me to you humiliated, hungry, and naked. Is this the extent of your gratitude to Allah Almighty for what He bestowed upon you regarding me?' Then she said: 'Peace be upon you,' and turned away.\n\nAl-Khayzuran shouted at her: 'This is not for you! You asked permission to see me, and you intended me, so what is my fault?' She returned and said: 'By my life, you have spoken the truth, O sister. What turned me back to you was the harm and exhaustion I am in.' Zaynab said: Al-Khayzuran rose to embrace her, but she said: 'There is no place for that in me given the state I am in.' Al-Khayzuran said to her: 'The bathhouse then.' She ordered a group of her maids to enter the bath with her. She entered and asked for a comb to remove the hair from her face. A maid of Al-Khayzuran came out laughing. Al-Khayzuran asked her: 'What makes you laugh?' She said: 'I laugh, my lady, at this woman and her commanding us; she acts in a way you do not.' She remained until she was brought out of the bath. Robes and perfume were brought to her; she took whatever clothes she wanted, perfumed herself, and came out to us. Al-Khayzuran embraced her and seated her in the place where the Commander of the Faithful Al-Mahdi sits when he enters.\n\nThen Al-Khayzuran said to her: 'Would you like food, for we haven't eaten yet?' She said: 'By Allah, there is no one among you more in need of it than me, so hasten it.' The table was brought, and she began eating without shyness, feeding us mouthfuls and placing food before us, until she was satisfied. Then we washed our hands. Al-Khayzuran asked her: 'Who is behind you that you care for?' She said: 'There is no one outside this house created by Allah with whom I have relations.' Al-Khayzuran said: 'If this is so, stand up and choose for yourself one of our compartments. I will move everything you need to it, and we will not part until death parts us.' She stood up, and we walked her through the compartments. She chose the most spacious and pleasant one. She did not leave until all she needed of furnishings, clothes, silks, and slaves were moved to it. Then we left her there and went out. Al-Khayzuran said: 'This woman was in the state she was in, and harm has touched her. Nothing washes what is in her heart except money. Carry five hundred thousand dirhams to her.' So it was carried to her.",

    "text": "Al-Mahdi joined us and asked about the news. I told him her story and how I met her. By Allah, he did not wait for me to tell him her response before he jumped up, angry at my face, saying: 'O Zaynab! For God's sake! Is this the extent of your gratitude to Allah for His blessing, when He enabled you over such a woman in the state she is in? By Allah, were it not for your place in my heart, I would have sworn never to speak to you again.' I said: 'I apologized to her and she accepted.' Then I told him her whole story and what Al-Khayzuran did for her. He said to a servant who was with him: 'Carry a hundred bags of money to her, enter upon her, convey my greetings, and say to her: \"By Allah, I have never been as happy in my life as I am today with your presence. I am your brother and one who obligates your right. Do not leave a need without asking for it. Were it not that I dislike embarrassing you, I would have crossed over to greet you and fulfill your right.\"' The servant went with the money and the message. She came to us with him, greeted Al-Mahdi, thanked him for his deed, praised Al-Khayzuran, and said: 'I feel no shyness before the Commander of the Faithful; I am counted among his household.' She sat for an hour then rose to her dwelling. I left her with Al-Khayzuran as if she had always been in that palace. This story is better for you than Kitab, and I have gifted Kitab to you. I left her place, and she followed it up with enough to fill my house.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani said: Al-Hasan bin Ali told me: Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal told me: Ishaq bin Musa al-Ansari told us: Yunus bin Bukayr told us from Muhammad bin Ishaq who said: There were people in Medina who lived without knowing where their livelihood came from. When Ali bin al-Husayn, may Allah be pleased with them, died, they lost what used to be brought to them at night, and their situation was revealed.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is narrated about Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, that he was patrolling Medina during his caliphate when he found a slave girl weeping and saying:\n'I loved him before the cutting of my amulets... swaying like a soft branch.\nAs if the light of the full moon resembles his face... he walks and ascends to the peak of Hashim.'\nHe knocked on the door, and she came out to him. He asked her: 'Are you free or a slave?' She said: 'A slave, O Companion of the Messenger of Allah.' He asked her: 'Who do you love?' She wept and said: 'By the right of the owner of the grave (the Prophet), turn away from me.' He said: 'I will not leave my place until you inform me.' She said:\n'I am the one whom separation has struck her heart... so she wept for the love of Muhammad bin al-Qasim.'\nAbu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, went to the mosque and sent for her master. He bought her from him and sent her to Muhammad bin al-Qasim bin Ja'far bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: 'These are the temptations of men. By Allah, they have taken away a noble one and destroyed a sound one.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Salih al-Balakhi narrated in Egypt... about Shaybah bin Muhammad al-Dimashqi who said: In the days of Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, there was a man named Khuzayma bin Bishr from Banu Asad in Raqqa. He possessed manliness, good wealth, virtue, and kindness to his brothers. He remained in that state until he needed his brothers whom he used to favor. They comforted him for a while, then grew tired of him. When their change became apparent to him, he came to his wife, who was his cousin, and said to her: 'O cousin! I have seen a change in my brothers, and I have resolved to stay in my house until death comes to me.' He locked his door and stayed, subsisting on what he had until it ran out and he remained bewildered in his affair.\n\nIkrimah al-Fayyad al-Raba'i was the governor of Al-Jazira. While he was in his assembly with a group of the people of the town, Khuzayma bin Bishr was mentioned. Ikrimah said: 'What is his condition?' They said: 'He has reached a state of indescribable badness; he locked his door and stayed in his house.' Al-Fayyad (The Overflowing)—named so for his generosity—said: 'Did Khuzayma bin Bishr not find a comforter or a rewarder?' They said: 'No.' He remained silent. When night came, he took four thousand dinars and put them in a single bag. He ordered his beast to be saddled and went out secretly from his family. He rode with one of his slaves carrying the money. He traveled until he stopped at Khuzayma's door. He took the bag from the slave and sent him away. He approached the door and knocked on it himself. Khuzayma came out to him. He handed him the bag and said: 'Fix your affairs with this.' Khuzayma took it, found it heavy, put it down, grabbed the beast's bridle, and said to him: 'Who are you? May I be your ransom.' He said: 'I did not come to you at this hour wanting you to know me.' Khuzayma said: 'I will not accept it until you tell me who you are.' He said: 'I am Jaber Atharat al-Kiram (The Repairer of the Slips of the Noble).' He said: 'Tell me more.' He said: 'No.' Then he left.\n\nKhuzayma entered with the bag to his wife and said to her: 'Rejoice, for Allah has brought relief and good. Even if they are copper coins (fulus), they are many. Get up and light a lamp.' She said: 'There is no way to have a lamp.' He spent the night touching them, feeling the roughness of dinars, and not believing it.",

    "text": "Ikrimah returned to his home and found his wife missing him. She asked about him and was told he rode out alone. She became suspicious, tore her collar, and slapped her cheek. When he saw her in that state, he said: 'What has befallen you, O cousin?' She said: 'You betrayed your cousin, O Ikrimah.' He said: 'What is that?' She said: 'The Emir of Al-Jazira goes out after the quiet of the night, alone without his slaves, in secret from his family! By Allah, he goes out only to a wife or a concubine.' He said: 'Allah knows I did not go out to either.' She said: 'Then tell me regarding what you went out.' He said: 'O woman! I did not go out at this time wanting anyone to know about me.' She said: 'You must.' He said: 'Will you keep it secret then?' She said: 'I will.' So he told her the story as it happened, and what he said and what was replied to him. Then he said to her: 'Do you want me to swear to you?' She said: 'No, my heart is at peace with what you mentioned.'\n\nKhuzayma woke up, settled with his creditors, and improved his condition. Then he prepared to go to Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik in Palestine. When he stood at his door, the chamberlain entered and informed him of his presence. Since he was famous for his manliness, Sulayman knew him and permitted him entry. When he entered and greeted him as Caliph, Sulayman said: 'O Khuzayma, what delayed you from us?' He said: 'Bad conditions.' He said: 'What prevented you from rising to us?' He said: 'My weakness.' He said: 'Then with what (means) did you rise?' He said: 'I knew nothing, O Commander of the Faithful, after the quiet of the night, but a man knocked on my door, and such and such happened,' and he told him the story from beginning to end. Sulayman asked: 'Do you know him?' He said: 'I did not know him, O Commander of the Faithful, because he was disguised, and I heard nothing from him except: Jaber Atharat al-Kiram.' Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik sighed with longing to know him and said: 'If we knew him, we would have helped him in his manliness.' Then he said: 'Bring me a staff of office.' It was brought, and he appointed Khuzayma as governor of Al-Jazira, replacing Ikrimah al-Fayyad.",

    "text": "Khuzayma went out heading for Al-Jazira. When he neared it, Ikrimah and the people of the town came out to meet him. They greeted each other and walked together until they entered the town. Khuzayma settled in the Emirate house and ordered that Ikrimah be taken and audited. He was audited, and many surpluses (debts) were found against him. Khuzayma demanded he pay them. Ikrimah said: 'I have no way to pay any of it.' Khuzayma said: 'It must be paid.' Ikrimah said: 'I do not have it, so do what you must.' Khuzayma ordered him to prison. Then he sent to him demanding payment. Ikrimah sent back: 'I am not one who preserves his wealth with his honor, so do what you wish.' Khuzayma ordered him shackled with iron and restricted him. He remained like that for a month or more. This exhausted him and harmed him. News of his harm reached his female cousin (wife), and she grieved and was distressed. She called a wise maid of hers and said: 'Go immediately to the door of this Emir and say: I have advice. If asked what it is, say: I will not say it except to Emir Khuzayma bin Bishr. If you enter upon him, ask him to clear the room. If he does, say to him: This was not the reward for Jaber Atharat al-Kiram from you; you repaid him with prison, restriction, and iron.' She did so. When Khuzayma heard her words, he said: 'What a shame! Is it really him?' She said: 'Yes.'\n\nHe immediately ordered his beast saddled, sent for the heads of the townspeople, gathered them, and came to the prison door. It was opened, and Khuzayma and those with him entered. He found Ikrimah at the bottom of the prison, changed and exhausted by harm. When Ikrimah looked at him and the people, he felt ashamed and lowered his head. Khuzayma approached him, bent over his head, and kissed it. Ikrimah raised his head and said: 'What followed this from you?' He said: 'Your noble deed and my bad repayment.' He said: 'May Allah forgive us and you.' Then he ordered the blacksmith to unlock his chains, and Khuzayma ordered them to be placed on his own legs. Ikrimah said: 'What do you want?' He said: 'I want to suffer the harm like you suffered.' He said: 'I adjure you by Allah not to do it.' They went out together until they reached Khuzayma's house. Ikrimah bid him farewell and wanted to leave. Khuzayma said: 'You are not leaving.' He said: 'What do you want?' He said: 'To change your condition, for my shame before your cousin is greater than my shame before you.' He ordered the bathhouse cleared, and they entered together. Khuzayma stood and served him himself. Then they came out, and he gave him robes of honor, beautified him, and carried a lot of money to him. Then he went with him to his house and asked permission to apologize to his cousin. He permitted him, so he apologized to her and blamed himself for his action. Then he asked him to go with him to the Commander of the Faithful Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik, who was residing in Ramla at that time. He agreed, so they traveled together until they arrived at Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik.\n\nThe chamberlain entered and informed him of Khuzayma bin Bishr's arrival. This alarmed him, and he said: 'The Governor of Al-Jazira arrives without our command, despite having been appointed recently? This is only for a grave event.' When he entered, he said to him before he greeted: 'What is behind you, O Khuzayma?' He said: 'Good, O Commander of the Faithful.' He said: 'Then what brought you?' He said: 'I found Jaber Atharat al-Kiram, and I wanted to please you with him, as I saw your eagerness and longing to see him.' He said: 'And who is he?' He said: 'Ikrimah al-Fayyad.' He permitted him to enter. He entered and greeted him as Caliph. He welcomed him, brought him close to his seat, and said: 'O Ikrimah! Your good to him was nothing but trouble for you.' Then he said: 'Write all your needs and what you choose on a piece of paper.' He said: 'Or will the Commander of the Faithful excuse me?' He said: 'It must be done.' He called for an inkwell and paper and said: 'Step aside and write all your needs.' He did so. He ordered them all fulfilled immediately and ordered ten thousand dinars and two baskets of clothes for him. Then he called for a staff of office and appointed him over Al-Jazira, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, and said to him: 'Khuzayma's fate is up to you; if you wish, keep him, and if you wish, dismiss him.' He said: 'Rather, I return him to his work, O Commander of the Faithful.' Then they left together. They remained governors for Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik for the duration of his caliphate.",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** Al-Hasan bin Khidr narrated: When the Caliphate passed to the Abbasids, the men of Banu Umayya went into hiding. Among those hiding was Ibrahim bin Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik, until Dawud bin al-Abbas obtained a pardon for him. Ibrahim was a knowledgeable young man, favored by Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah. He said to him one day: 'Tell me about what you went through during your hiding.' He said: 'I was, O Commander of the Faithful, hiding in Al-Hira in a house overlooking the desert. While I was on the roof of a house, I saw black flags coming out of Kufa heading for Al-Hira. I felt they were coming for me, so I left the house in disguise until I came to Kufa. I knew no one there to hide with. I remained bewildered until I saw a large gate and a spacious courtyard. I entered it. Suddenly, a handsome man of good appearance on a horse entered the courtyard, accompanied by a group of his slaves and followers. He said to me: \"Who are you and what is your need?\" I said: \"A man in hiding fearing for his blood seeking refuge in your house.\" He took me into his house, then put me in a room next to his harem. I was with him receiving whatever I liked of food, drink, and clothing. He did not ask me about my condition, except that he rode out every day. I said to him one day: \"I see you riding constantly, why is that?\" He said: \"Ibrahim bin Sulayman killed my father in captivity. I have heard he is hiding, and I am searching for him to take my revenge.\" My amazement at our misfortune increased, by Allah, as fate drove me to my death in the house of the one seeking my blood. I hated life, so I asked the man his name and his father's name. He told me, and I knew the news was true, and I had killed his father in captivity. I said: \"O you, your right has become incumbent upon me, and it is your right upon me that I guide you to your enemy and shorten your step.\" He said: \"What is that?\" I said: \"I am Ibrahim bin Sulayman, your father's killer, so take your revenge.\" He said: \"I think you are a man whom hiding has wearied, so you prefer death.\" I said: \"Nay, the truth is what I told you. I killed him on such and such day for such and such reason.\" When he knew my truth, his face changed, his eyes turned red, and he looked down for a long time. Then he said: \"As for you, you will meet my father and he will take his revenge from you. As for me, I will not betray my trust (of granting refuge). Go away from me, for I do not trust myself with you after this.\" He gave me a thousand dinars, but I did not take them, and I left his presence. This is the most generous man I have seen after the Commander of the Faithful.'\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that Abdullah bin al-Zubayr had land bordering the land of Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan. Muawiyah had placed negro slaves there to cultivate it, and they encroached upon Abdullah's land. He wrote to Muawiyah: \"Now then, O Muawiyah, prevent your slaves from entering my land, or else there will be a matter between me and you.\" When Muawiyah read the letter—he was then the Commander of the Faithful—he handed it to his son Yazid. When Yazid read it, Muawiyah said to him: \"O son, what do you think?\" He said: \"I think you should send an army to him, the first of which is with him and the last with you, to bring you his head.\" He said: \"Or better than that, O son. Bring me an inkwell and paper.\" He wrote: \"I have read the letter of the son of the Disciple of the Messenger of Allah, and what displeased him displeased me. The whole world to me is insignificant compared to his satisfaction. I have written a deed for the land and the slaves for him upon myself, and witnessed it. Let him annex it with its slaves to his land and slaves. Peace.\" When Abdullah read Muawiyah's letter, he wrote to him: \"I have read the letter of the Commander of the Faithful, may Allah prolong his life. May he not lack the judgment that placed him in this position among Quraysh. Peace.\" When Muawiyah read Abdullah's letter, he threw it to his son Yazid. When he read it, his face brightened. Muawiyah said to him: \"O son, if you are afflicted with such a disease, treat it with such a medicine.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** Abdullah bin Sulayman said: I was in the presence of my father in the Bureau of Land Tax in Surra Man Ra'a (Samarra) while he was in charge of it. Ahmad bin Abi Khalid al-Sarifini, the scribe, entered. My father stood up for him from his seat, seated him in the place of honor, and attended to him. He did not look at any work until Ahmad stood up, then he stood up with him and ordered his slaves to walk before him. I and everyone in the assembly found this strange, because the custom of bureau chiefs, small and large, is not to stand in the bureau for anyone entering. My father noticed this in my face and said to me: \"O son, when we are alone, ask me about the reason for what I did with this man.\"",

    "text": "He said: My father used to eat in the bureau, sleep there, and do calculations in the evening. When we sat to eat, I did not mention it until the food was almost finished. He initiated saying: 'O son, did the food distract you from reminding me what I told you to?' I said: 'No, but I wanted it to be in private.' He said: 'This is a time of privacy.' Then he said: 'Did you not disapprove, along with those present, my standing for Ahmad bin Abi Khalid upon his entry and exit, and what I did with him?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'This man governed Egypt for years. I took over its administration and dismissed him. His term there had been long, so I investigated him. I saw the traces of a man; never have I seen better traces, nor one more chaste regarding the Sultan's and subjects' money, nor have I seen subjects more grateful to a governor than his subjects to him. Al-Husayn the Eunuch, known as 'Arq al-Mawt' (Vein of Death), the postmaster in Egypt, was the most truthful person to him despite this, and he was the most hateful person to me and the most volatile in character. So I found no argument against him. I found he had delayed submitting the accounts for a previous year and the year he was in, which he didn't complete because I dismissed him. The bureau did not send them to me. So I demanded he reduce the income record, increase expenses and salaries, and write off arrears of one hundred thousand dinars every year for me to take for myself. He refused. I was harsh with him and threatened him. I came down to one hundred thousand dinars total for the two years and swore solemn, confirmed oaths that I would not accept less. He persisted in his refusal and said: \"I do not betray for myself, so how can I betray for another and remove the status my chastity has established?\" I imprisoned him and shackled him, but he did not respond. He remained shackled in prison for months. 'Arq al-Mawt', the postmaster, wrote the news to Al-Mutawakkil, swearing to him that Egypt's funds were not covering my expenses and supplies, describing Ahmad bin Abi Khalid, and mentioning the subjects' inclination towards him and his chastity. Al-Mutawakkil sent his reinstatement.\n\nI was eating one day when Ahmad bin Abi Khalid's note arrived asking me to summon him for an important matter he wanted to tell me. I had no doubt he had been harmed by the prison and chains and resolved to agree to my wish. When I washed my hands, I called him and took him aside. He said: \"Isn't it time, my master, for you to pity me for what I am in, without any sin against you, nor crime, nor old grudge or enmity?\" I said: \"You chose that for yourself. You heard my oath, and there is no way out of it. Agree to what I want from you and get out.\" He began to beg for sympathy, serve me, and deceive me. This came contrary to what I estimated of him, so it enraged me. I insulted him and said: \"Is this the important matter you mentioned in your note you wanted to tell me? To beg for sympathy, seek refuge, and deceive me?\" He said: \"O master, is there nothing else with you now?\" I said: \"No.\" He said: \"If there is nothing else with you, then read this, O master,\" and he brought out a small sealed letter in a quarter sheet. I broke the seal, and it was in Al-Mutawakkil's handwriting, which I knew, ordering me to leave, hand over what I control to Ahmad bin Abi Khalid, clear myself of obligations, submit the accounts to him, obey his command, and march from Egypt afterward. It struck me in the ugliest way due to how recently I had insulted him and mistreated him, while he was instantly under my iron and harm. I held back, stunned. Before long, the Emir of Egypt entered with his companions and slaves, and put guards on my house, all I owned, my companions, slaves, treasurers, and scribes. I began crawling from the seat of honor until I was before Ahmad bin Abi Khalid, unable to stand, while he was still in his chains. The Emir of the town called a blacksmith who undid his chains. I extended my legs for the chains to be placed on them. He said to me: \"O Abu Ayyub, pull your feet together.\" He jumped up standing, then said to me: \"O Abu Ayyub, you are new to the governorship of this town. You have no home in it nor friend, and you have a harem and entourage. Only this house fits you (it was the Governor's House). As for me, I can find several other places, and I have little entourage, and I have just come out of calamity and chains. So stay in your place.\" He left me, dismissed the guards from me and the house, and took my scribes and followers to him. When he left, I said to my slaves: \"Is this what I see in a dream? Look who he put in charge of us.\" They said: \"He put no one in charge of us.\" I marveled at that greatly. Before I prayed Asr, those of the officials, scribes, and treasurers he had taken with him returned to me released, saying: \"He took our signatures for submitting the accounts, ordered us to attend, and released us.\" My amazement increased. The next day he came early greeting me, and I went to him in the evening of that day. I stayed thirty days; if he beat me to coming, I went to him, and if I went to him, he came early to me. Every day his gifts and favors of ice, fruit, animals, sweets, and perfume came to me. After thirty days, he came to me and said: \"You have fallen in love with Egypt, O Abu Ayyub. By Allah, its air is not good nor sweet. It is only pleasant for non-locals through governance and earning. If you traveled to Baghdad and Surra Man Ra'a, you would stay only a month before assuming the highest offices.\" I said: \"By Allah, I only stayed expecting your order to leave.\" He said: \"Give me your scribe's note that he is responsible for the accounts, and leave in the safety of Allah.\" I summoned my scribe, took his note as he wanted, and handed the note to him. He said to me: \"Leave whenever you wish.\" So I left the next day. He, the Emir of Egypt, its judge, notables, and people saw me off to the outskirts of Egypt. He said to me: \"Stay at the first station five parasangs away until I resolve the issue of a commander to accompany you with his men to Ramla, for the road is unsafe.\" I became terrified of that and said: \"He only deceived me until I brought out all I own and earned, so he can overpower it outside the town, seize it, then return me to prison, guards, and demands, using a second letter as an excuse claiming it is a deed.\" I went out and stayed at the stage he mentioned, surrendering to fate, expecting evil, until I saw the vanguard of his army coming from Egypt. I said: \"Perhaps it is the commander he wants to accompany me, or perhaps he wants to arrest me.\" I ordered my slaves to find out the news. They said: \"The worker Ahmad bin Abi Khalid has come.\" I had no doubt that calamity had arrived with his arrival. I left my tent, met him, and greeted him. When he sat, he said: \"Leave us alone.\" I had no doubt it was for arresting me. My mind flew, and whoever was with me left.",

That chapter (of graft) you asked me for during your governorship, I did not respond to you in it. I delayed the permission for you to leave from the beginning until now because I busied myself completing it for you. I have lowered the revenue record and increased the expenses by fifteen thousand dinars each year, making thirty thousand dinars for the two years. It is close and does not show, and it is easier (safer) than what you wanted from me at that time. I busied myself with it until I collected it for you. This money is on the mules; I have brought it to you, so proceed to have someone receive it.\" I advanced to receive it, kissed his hand, and said: \"By Allah, my master, you have done what the Barmakids did not do.\" He denied that from me, pulled away, kissed my hand and foot, and said: \"There is something else here I want you to accept.\" I said: \"What is it?\" He said: \"Five thousand dinars, which I have rightfully earned from my salary.\" I refused it and said: \"There is sufficiency in what you have favored me with.\" He swore by divorce that I accept it from him, so I accepted it. He said: \"And here are some favors from the gifts of Egypt I wanted you to take with you. For you are going to the bureau scribes and court chiefs, and they will say to you: 'You governed Egypt, so where is our share of its gifts?' Your days were not long enough to prepare that for them. I have collected for you what this list contains.\" He brought out a scroll containing a comprehensive list of everything beautiful, rare, and valuable in the world of every kind: Dabizi clothes, linens, servants, mules, beasts, donkeys, furnishings, perfume, even pens and ink, the value of which is a lot of money. I ordered it received and increased my thanks. He said to me: \"O master, I am fond of furnishings. I had an Armenian tent made for me in Armenia, consisting of ten prayer rugs with their pillows, cushions, armrests, mattresses, and carpets, with gilded embroidery. It cost me five thousand dinars despite my strictness. I have gifted it to you. If you gift it to the Vizier, he will be your servant; if you gift it to the Caliph, you will own him with it; and if you keep it for yourself and beautify yourself with it, that is more beloved to me.\" He said: He loaded it. I never saw the like of it. My soul did not allow gifting it to anyone or using it. I did not use anything from it, O son, except on the day of your circumcision, for I used the centerpiece, cushions, and pillows. Do you blame me, O son, for standing up for this man? I said: \"No, by Allah, O father; nor for what is more than standing, if it were possible.\" He said: My father was such after that, if he dismissed a man from a job, he treated him with every beauty and would say: \"Ibn Abi Khalid taught us—may Allah reward him well—good conduct.\"",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** It is said that when the mosque in Egypt burned, the Muslims thought the Christians burned it, so they burned a khan belonging to them. The Sultan arrested a group of those who burned the khan. He wrote tickets containing \"Killing,\" \"Amputation,\" and \"Flogging\" and scattered them over them. Whoever got a ticket, that was done to him. A ticket containing \"Killing\" fell into the hand of a man. He said: \"I wouldn't care if not for a mother of mine.\" There was a young man beside him who said: \"My ticket is Flogging, and I have no mother. Give me your ticket and take mine.\" They did so; that one was killed and this one was flogged.\n\n**Anecdote:** The Master Abu Ali said: When Ghulam Khalil slandered the Sufis to the Caliph accusing them of heresy (Zandaqa), he ordered their beheading. As for Al-Junayd, he covered himself with jurisprudence and used to give fatwas according to the school of Abu Thawr. As for Al-Shahham, Al-Raqqam, Al-Thawri, and a group, they were arrested, and the leather mat was spread for beheading. Al-Thawri stepped forward. The executioner said to him: \"Do you know why you are stepping forward?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"What makes you hasten?\" He said: \"I prefer my companions with an hour of life.\" The executioner was bewildered, and the news was raised to the Caliph. He returned them to the judge to investigate their condition. The judge posed jurisprudential questions to Abu al-Husayn al-Thawri, and he answered all of them. Then he began saying: \"Furthermore, Allah has servants who, when they stand, stand for Allah, and when they speak, speak by Allah,\" and he recited expressions until he made the judge weep. He sent to the Caliph saying: \"If these are heretics, then there is no Muslim on the face of the earth.\" So he ordered their release, and they were released.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that when Al-Hajjaj killed Abdullah bin al-Zubayr, he traveled to Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, accompanied by Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Talha bin Abdullah. When he arrived at Abd al-Malik's, he did not begin with any speech except to say: \"I came to you, O Commander of the Faithful, with the man of Hijaz in honor and fatherhood; I leave no equal for him in it, by Allah, in perfection of manliness and etiquette, good doctrine, obedience, and advice, along with kinship to the Commander of the Faithful: Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Talha bin Abdullah. So do with him, O Commander of the Faithful, what deserves to be done with the likes of him in his fatherhood and honor.\" He said to him: \"O Abu Muhammad, you have reminded us of a mandatory right and close kinship. Permit Ibrahim to enter.\" When he entered and greeted as Caliph, he ordered him to sit in the place of honor. Abd al-Malik said to him: \"Abu Muhammad has reminded us of what we have always known of you regarding fatherhood and honor. Do not leave a need of your private or public affairs without asking for it.\" Ibrahim said: \"As for the needs by which proximity is sought and reward is hoped, whatever is purely for Allah and His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and for you and the Muslims, I have advice which I must mention.\" He said: \"Is it excluding Abu Muhammad (Al-Hajjaj)?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Stand up, O Hajjaj.\" Al-Hajjaj stood up ashamed, not seeing where he stepped. Then he said: \"Speak, O Ibn Talha.\" He said: \"By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, you have entrusted Al-Hajjaj in his injustice, arrogance, and transgression, his distance from the truth and listening to falsehood. You appointed him over the Two Holy Sanctuaries, where reside the sons of the Muhajirun and Ansar and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. He humiliates them and treads on them with oppression using the riffraff of the people of Sham and rabble who have no deliberation in establishing right nor removing falsehood. So dismiss him.\" Abd al-Malik looked down for an hour, then raised his head and said: \"You lied and spoke falsehood, O Ibn Talha. Al-Hajjaj thought of you other than what is in you. Stand up, for perhaps good is thought of people not worthy of it.\" Ibrahim said: \"I stood up, and by Allah, I could not see a road. A guard followed me and he (Abd al-Malik) said to him: 'Hold him tight.'\" Ibrahim said: \"I remained sitting. Al-Hajjaj was called, and they whispered for a long time until I thought the worst, and I had no doubt it was about my affair. Then I was called. I stood up and met Al-Hajjaj in the courtyard leaving. He kissed me between the eyes and said: 'If Allah rewards brothers for the virtue of their love with good, may He beautify your reward from me. By Allah, if I live for you, I will raise your status and follow your heels.'\" He said: \"I said to myself: Al-Hajjaj is mocking me, by Allah. I entered upon Abd al-Malik, and he seated me in my first seat. Then he said: 'O Ibn Talha, did anyone share in your advice?' I said: 'No, by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful. I intended only Allah, His Messenger, the Muslims, and you.' He said: 'I knew that. I have dismissed Al-Hajjaj from the Two Holy Sanctuaries when you hated him there, and I informed him that you considered that too little for him and asked me for a major governorship for him. I have appointed him over the two Iraqs, and informed him that you solicited that for him to increase his status, so that he owes you a debt by which he performs to you, on my behalf, the reward of your advice. Go out with him, for you will not blame his company.' So I went out with him, and I received every good from him.\"",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** Judge Abu al-Qasim Ali bin al-Muhsin bin Ali al-Tanukhi said: Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani told me from memory: I read in some ancient chronicles that when Alexander reached China and besieged its king, his chamberlain came to him after half the night had passed and said: 'The messenger of the King of China is at the door asking permission to see you.' He said: 'Let him in.' When he entered, he stood before him, greeted, and said: 'If the King sees fit to leave me alone with him, let him do so.' Alexander ordered those present to leave, and his chamberlain remained. The messenger said to him: 'What I came for cannot bear to be heard by anyone else.' He ordered him searched. He was searched, and no weapon was found on him. Alexander placed a drawn sword before him and said: 'Stand your ground and say what you wish.' Then he sent out everyone who was with him. When the place was empty, the messenger said to him: 'I am the King of China, not his messenger. I have come to ask you what you want from me. If it is something possible to comply with, even in the most difficult ways, I will agree to it, and spare you and myself from war.' Alexander said to him: 'What secures me from you?' He said: 'My knowledge that you are a wise man, that there is no prior enmity between us, nor claim for revenge, and that you know that if you kill me, the people of China will not surrender their kingdom to you, nor will my absence prevent them from appointing a king other than me. Then you would be attributed to the essence of ignorance and the opposite of prudence.' Alexander looked down thinking about his speech and knew he was a wise man. Then he said to him: 'What I want from you is the revenue of your kingdom for three years immediately, and half its revenue every year.' He said: 'Is there anything else?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'I have answered you.' He said: 'Then how will your condition be then?' He said: 'I will be the victim of the first warrior and the meal of the first predator.' He said: 'If I accept the revenue of two years from you, how will your condition be?' He said: 'Better than it would be if I were bound by what was previously mentioned.' He said: 'If I accept the revenue of one year from you?' He said: 'That would be detrimental to my kingdom and take away all my pleasures.' He said: 'If I limited myself to the sixth?' He said: 'The sixth would be available, and the rest for my army and the causes of the kingdom.' He said: 'I have limited myself to this from you.' He thanked him and left.\n\nWhen morning came and the sun rose, the army of China approached until it covered the earth and surrounded Alexander's army until they feared destruction. His companions jumped up, mounted, and prepared for war. While they were like that, the King of China appeared wearing the crown. When he saw Alexander, he dismounted. Alexander said to him: 'Did you betray?' He said: 'No, by Allah.' He said: 'Then what is this army?' He said: 'I wanted to let you know that I did not obey you out of scarcity or weakness—and for you to see the army, and what is absent from you is greater—but I saw the ethereal world turning towards you, enabling you. I knew that whoever fights the ethereal world is defeated. So I wanted to obey it by obeying you, and humble myself to its command by humbling myself to you.' Alexander said: 'One like you should not have anything taken from him. I have not seen anyone between me and you deserving preference and description of wisdom other than you. I have exempted you from everything I wanted from you, and I am leaving you.' The King of China said: 'Since you have done that, you will not lose.' When Alexander departed, the King of China followed him with gifts and favors double what he had decided with him.",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** Numayr al-Hilali narrated: Among the youths of Banu Hilal was a young man named Bishr bin Abdullah, known as Al-Ashtar. He was one of the masters of Banu Hilal, the best looking, and the most generous of hand. He admired a girl from his people called Jayda, who was of outstanding beauty and perfection. Their affair became famous, and news of them appeared. Evil occurred between their families until blood was shed between the two groups, then they separated and their dwellings became distant. Numayr said: When the separation became long for Al-Ashtar and the distance continued, he came to me and said: 'O Numayr, is there any good?' I said: 'I have it, say what you like.' He said: 'Help me visit Jayda, for longing has taken my soul.' I said: 'Yes, with love and honor. Let us go if you wish.' He rode, and I rode with him. We traveled our day and night, evening and morning, until when it was evening, we made our camels kneel in a ravine near the group. He said: 'O Numayr, go and socialize with the people. Mention if you meet anyone that you are seeking a stray animal. Do not hint at my mention by lip or tongue, unless you meet her maid so-and-so, the shepherdess of their sheep. Give her my greetings, ask her about the news, and inform her of my location.' Numayr said: I went out not exceeding what he ordered me until I met the maid. I delivered the message, informed her of his place, and asked her about the news. She said: 'By Allah, she is strictly watched and guarded. But your appointment is those trees at the backs of the houses at the time of the last evening prayer.' He said: I returned to my companion and informed him of the news. Then he and I went leading our camels until we came to the place at the appointed time. We waited only a little when Jayda walked near us. Al-Ashtar jumped up, shook her hand, and greeted her. I stood up turning away from them. They said: 'We swear you must return. By Allah, we are not doing anything hateful, nor is there anything between us to hide from you.' I returned to them and sat with them. Al-Ashtar said to her: 'Is there any trick, O Jayda, to distract yourself tonight?' She said: 'No, by Allah, I have no way to that unless the calamity and evil you know returns.' Al-Ashtar said to her: 'It must be, even if it is whatever it may be.' She said: 'Is there any good in this companion of yours?' I said: 'Say what seems best to you, for I will follow your opinion even if it means the loss of my life.' She took off her clothes and said to me: 'Wear them and give me your clothes.' I did so. Then she said: 'Go to my house and enter my curtain. My husband will come to you asking for the bowl to milk into. Then he will come to you after finishing milking with the bowl full and say: \"Here is your evening drink.\" Do not take it from him until you prolong that upon him. Then take it or leave it until he puts it down and leaves. You will not see him, God willing.'\n\nHe said: I went and did what she ordered me. When he came with the bowl, I did not take it from him until my stubbornness prolonged upon him. Then I reached to take it from him, and he reached to put it down. Our hands clashed over the vessel; it slipped and the milk spilled. He said: 'This is the recalcitrance of Jayda!' He struck his hand on the front of the tent and pulled out a twisted whip like a snake. Then he entered, tore the curtain off me, and enjoyed giving me twenty full lashes. Then his mother and sister came and pulled me from his hand. By Allah, they did not do that until I lost my mind, and I intended to stab him with a knife even if it meant death. When they left, I tightened my curtain and sat as I was. I waited only a little until Jayda's mother entered. She spoke to me, having no doubt I was her daughter, and burst into weeping and wailing. I covered myself with my garment and turned my back to her. She said: 'O daughter, fear Allah regarding yourself, and do not expose yourself to your husband's hatred, for that is better for you. As for Al-Ashtar, he has perished forever.' She left me and said: 'I will send your sister to you to keep you company tonight.' I stayed not long, and behold, the girl came. She began crying and praying against the one who beat me, while I did not speak to her. Then she lay down by my side. When I had power over her, I tightened my hand over her mouth and said: 'O you, that is your sister with Al-Ashtar by the trees, and my back has been cut tonight because of her. You are the most worthy to cover for her. Choose for yourself and her. By Allah, if you speak a word, I will shout with all my might until the scandal is total.' Then I lifted my hand from her mouth. She shook like a reed shakes. I remained with her until she became familiar. By Allah, she spent the night with me as the best companion I ever accompanied. We kept talking and she laughing at me and what befell me. I had power over her such that if one wanted something illicit, he could have, but Allah protected, so praise be to Him. We remained like that until dawn broke, and suddenly Jayda entered upon us. When she saw us, she was startled and said: 'Woe to you, who is this?' I said: 'Your sister.' She said: 'What is the news?' I said: 'She will tell you, for she is an excellent sister.' I took my clothes and went to my companion. I rode, and he rode. I told him what befell me and uncovered my back to him. It had beating marks—may Allah strike the beater with a crushing fire—every blow bleeding. When he saw that, he said: 'Your deed is great, your thanks are obligatory, and your hand is long.",

    "text": "May Allah not deprive me of rewarding you.' He remained thankful and acknowledging to me.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abd al-Rahman bin Umar al-Fihri narrated from men he named: Al-Mamun ordered ten men from Basra who were accused of Zandaqa (heresy) to be brought to him. While one of the party-crashers (Tufayli) was looking around, he saw them gathered being taken to the shore to travel to Baghdad. He said: 'These people have gathered only for a banquet.' He slipped in with them and entered their group. The guards took them to the river and made them board a skiff prepared for them. The Tufayli said: 'No doubt it is a picnic.' He went up with them into the skiff. No sooner had he done so than the group was shackled, and the Tufayli was shackled with them. He knew he had fallen into a predicament. He tried to escape but could not. Then the sailor pushed off, and they traveled until they reached Baghdad. They were carried until they entered upon Al-Mamun. He ordered their beheading. They were called by their names, man by man. Everyone he called, he questioned and ordered his beheading, until no one remained but the Tufayli, and the count was finished. Al-Mamun said to the guards: 'What is this?' They said: 'By Allah, we do not know, O Commander of the Faithful, other than that we found him with the group, so we brought him.' Al-Mamun said: 'What is your story, woe to you?' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, his wife is divorced if he knows anything of their sayings, and he knows nothing but \"There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\" I only saw them gathered, thought they were invited to a banquet or feast, so I joined them.' Al-Mamun laughed and then said: 'The bad luck of party-crashing reached such an extent that it put its owner in this place. This ignorant man has been saved from death, but let him be disciplined so he repents.'\n\nIbrahim bin al-Mahdi was present that day and said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, gift him to me, and I will tell you a wondrous story about myself regarding party-crashing.' He said: 'I gift him to you, so bring your story.' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, I went out one day in disguise to look at the alleys of Baghdad. Sightseeing distracted me, and my walking ended at a wing (of a house) where I smelled the scents of food and spices wafting. My soul longed for it, and I stood, O Commander of the Faithful, unable to move on. I raised my gaze, and there was a window. In its opening were a hand and a wrist; I had never seen anything more beautiful. I stood bewildered, forgetting the food smells because of that hand and wrist. I began devising a trick to reach it. I looked and saw a tailor near that place. I approached him and greeted him. He returned the greeting. I said: \"O master, whose house is this?\" He said: \"It belongs to a linen merchant.\" I said: \"What is his name?\" He said: \"So-and-so son of So-and-so.\" I said: \"Is he one who drinks wine?\" He said: \"Yes, and I think today he has a party; he only drinks with merchants like himself who are discreet.\" While we were talking, two noble men riding approached. He said: \"These are his drinking companions.\" I said: \"What are their names and kunyas?\" I was told So-and-so and So-and-so. I moved my beast and caught up with them. I said: \"May I be your ransom, Abu So-and-so (the host) has found you slow, may Allah honor him.\" I rode with them until we came to the door. I entered, and they entered. When the owner of the house saw me with them, he had no doubt I was associated with them. He welcomed me and seated me in the best places. Then the table was brought, and dishes were transferred to it. Its taste, O Commander of the Faithful, was better and more delicious than its smell. I said to myself: \"Allah has granted me the attainment of the goal regarding these dishes; the hand and wrist remain.\" Then washing water was brought, and we washed. Then we were moved to the drinking assembly. It was the most shapely and elegant assembly in all its affairs. The owner of the house began treating me kindly and turning to me in conversation, thinking I was a guest of his guests, and they did the same to me, thinking his honoring me was due to prior acquaintance and friendship.\n\nWe drank several cups, then a slave girl came out to us like a willow branch, in the utmost elegance and good appearance. She greeted without shyness. A cushion was folded for her, and she sat on it. A lute was brought, and she took it and tuned it perfectly. She was skillful. She burst into song:\n\"My eye imagined her, so her cheek became... and in the place of imagination, there is a trace of my gaze.\nHer figure passed through my mind, so it wounded it... I have never seen a figure wound the mind before.\nMy hand shook hers, so it pained her hand... from the touch of my hand, there is a wound in her fingertips.\"\n\nThen she burst into singing again:\n\"I signaled to her: Have you known my affection?... She replied with the corner of the eye: I am upon the covenant.\nSo speak about the intentional revealing of her secret... and she swerved from revealing also intentionally.\"\n\nI shouted: \"The weapon! The weapon!\" (implying killing/overwhelming beauty). Delight came over me such that I could not control myself. The group was also extremely delighted. Then she sang:\n\"Is it not strange that a house joins me... and you, yet we are not alone nor do we speak?\nExcept eyes revealing the secrets of souls... and the breaking of breaths upon a fire burning.\nA signal of mouths, a wink of an eyebrow,... a breaking of eyelids, and a hand greeting.\"",

    "text": "By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, I envied her skill, her knowledge of singing, and her hitting the meaning of the poetry, because she did not depart from the art she began with. I said: 'Something remains for you, O girl.' She threw the lute and said: 'When did you used to bring hateful people to your gatherings?' I regretted what I did and saw the people turn against me. I said to myself: 'I will lose everything I hoped for if I do not remedy my story.' I said: 'Is there a lute there?' They said: 'Yes.' A beautifully crafted lute was brought. I fixed what I wanted in it, then I burst into singing:\n'What is wrong with the dwellings that they do not answer a sad one?... Did they become deaf or did decay come and they decayed?\nIndeed, those who left with your heart left... a trickle in your eye that remains flowing.\nThey diminished their tears and said to me:... What did you encounter of love and what did we encounter?\nThey went in the evening, a memorable going... If they were confused, we were confused; or if guided, we were guided.\nAnd they threw themselves and others across the desert... If they died, we died; and if they lived, we lived.'\n\nI had not finished it, O Commander of the Faithful, before the girl jumped up and fell upon my feet kissing them and saying: 'An apology to you, my master. By Allah, I did not know your status, and I have never heard such craftsmanship from anyone.' Her master and everyone present stood up and did the same as her. Then the people increased in honoring and revering me. They were delighted to the utmost limit and drank with goblets and bowls. When I saw their delight, I burst into singing:\n'Is it in (the law of) Allah that you spend the evening not remembering me... while my eyes have shed blood from remembering you?\nTo Allah I complain of her stinginess and my generosity... She gives me sickness while giving bitter apple.\nSo return the stricken heart, you killed it... and do not leave it mind-boggled, infatuated.\nTo Allah I complain that she is a foreigner... while for her I am honored with love as long as I live.'\n\nI saw from the people's delight something that made me think they had lost their minds. I held back for an hour until they reviewed their affair and their souls calmed. Then I burst into singing:\n'This is your lover folded upon his grief... pouring his tears running upon his body.\nHe has a hand asking the Compassionate for his rest... from what is in him, and another hand upon his liver.\nO you who saw an infatuated, reckless, sick one... whose death was in his eye and his hand.'",

    "text": "The girl began shouting: 'This, by Allah, is singing, not what we are in.' The people drank, but the owner of the house retained some hold due to his good drinking capacity. The people became drunk and were overcome. He ordered his servants to protect them and take them to their homes. They left, and I remained alone with him. He drank some cups, then said: 'My master, what passed of my life went to waste since I did not know the likes of you, nor sat with a chief resembling you. So by Allah, my master, who are you so I may know my drinking companion?' I began to hide it from him while he swore upon me until I informed him who I really was. He jumped up on his feet and said: 'I wondered that this excellence could belong to anyone but the likes of you. Time has bestowed a favor upon me I cannot thank enough. When did I hope for the Caliphate to visit me in my home and drink with me all night! This is only in dreams. I will not complete my night except standing before you, as I am too despicable to sit with the Caliphate.' I swore upon him to sit, so he sat. Then he began asking me: 'What is the reason for your presence at his place?' with the gentlest question and finest meaning. I told him, O Commander of the Faithful, the story from beginning to end and hid nothing of it. Then I said: 'As for the food, I have attained my desire of it.' He said: 'And the hand and wrist you shall attain, God willing.' Then he said: 'O so-and-so, tell so-and-so (a maid of his) to come down.' Then he began calling them one by one, presenting them to me, but I did not see my companion. Until he said: 'By Allah, none remains but my mother and my sister, and by Allah, they shall come down.' I marveled at his generosity and broadmindedness. I said: 'May I be your ransom, start with the sister before the mother, for I am shy to look at your mother's palm.' He said: 'With love and honor.' Then his sister came down and showed me her palm. It was the one I saw. I said: 'Enough, this is the girl.' He immediately ordered his servants to summon ten sheikhs he named. Then he stood up and brought out two bags containing twenty thousand dirhams. The sheikhs arrived, and he said to them: 'This is my master Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi proposing to my sister so-and-so, and I call you to witness that I have married her to him and given her a dowry from him of ten thousand dirhams.' I said: 'I accept and agree to the marriage.' They witnessed for us. Then he gave one bag to his sister and distributed the other among the sheikhs. Then he said: 'Excuse us, for this is what was available in such a situation.' They thanked him, prayed for him, and left. Then he said: 'My master, shall I prepare a bed for you in one of the rooms so you can sleep with your wife?' I was embarrassed by what I saw of his generosity and felt ashamed to be alone with her in his house. I said: 'Rather, bring a litter and carry her to my house.' He said: 'Whatever you wish.' A litter was brought, and I carried her to my house. By your right, O Commander of the Faithful, he carried to me such trousseau that our houses, despite their size, were too narrow for it. I fathered from her this boy standing before the Commander of the Faithful.\n\nAl-Mamun marveled at the generosity of this man and said: 'To Allah is his excellence! I have never heard of such a deed.' Then he released the party-crasher and rewarded him, and ordered Ibrahim to bring the man so he could see him. He was brought before him, he spoke with him, liked him, and he became one of his intimates and companions.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "It is told about a scholar who said: An old man used to sit with me. Whatever topic of knowledge I spoke about, he would weep, until this went on for a long time. I said to him one day when we were alone: 'I see you sticking to my assembly yet asking nothing, and I constantly see you weeping. What is your situation?' He said: 'Yes, my master. I was a man who bought and sold slaves for profit. Once, a boy with a radiant face and perfect physique fell into my hands. He was young. I bought him for three hundred dinars, adorned him, and prepared him for whoever would desire to buy him. One day, a handsome young boy passed by us. When he saw the slave boy, he got off his beast and said: \"Is this boy for sale?\" I said: \"Yes.\" He turned the boy around, examined him, and said to him: \"What is your name, what is your race, and what are you good at?\" He informed him. Then he said to me: \"How much is he?\" I said: \"A thousand dinars.\" He squeezed the boy's hand a pinch then left. I looked at the boy's hand and found a purse. I counted it and found one hundred dinars. I said to him: \"Do you know the man?\" He said: \"No.\" When the next day came, he came and did as he did yesterday. When the third day came, he came and did as he did the previous two days. I said to myself: \"This man did not give this one three hundred dinars unless he loves him, and he cannot afford the price I mentioned to him.\" So I followed him until I knew his place. When evening came, I ordered the boy to wear his finest clothes, perfumed him, adorned him, and said to him: \"This man has given us the like of your price. I have decided to take you to him, so be obedient to him, and inform me of what happens with him.\" I went with him to the man's house after the last evening prayer. I knocked on the door. He came out and opened the door. When he saw us, he was dumbfounded, then said \"Inna lillahi...\" and said: \"What brought you two?\" I said: \"I presented this boy to some Baghdadi kings just now, and no deal was concluded with them. I fear the night patrol for him, so keep him with you until morning.\" He said: \"Come in and stay with him until morning.\" I said: \"I cannot do that, so leave him with you, and beware that he leaves your house or control until I come to you early.\" I left and returned to my bed, thinking about his affair. Suddenly, the boy came terrified and weeping. I said to him: \"What is behind you?\" He said to me: \"The man died just now.\" I said: \"Woe to you, how did that happen?\" He said: \"I entered with him. He brought me food, so I ate. I washed my hands, and he perfumed me. Then he came and placed his index finger on my cheek and said: 'I testify that you are beautiful, and what my soul calls me to regarding you is ugly, and the punishment Allah threatened for it is uglier and more severe.' Then he said 'Inna lillahi...'. Then he placed his finger on my cheek again and said: 'I testify that you are beautiful, and the good and reward Allah promised for (abstaining from) it is better and more beautiful.' Then he fell. I moved him, and behold, he was dead.\" The Sheikh said: \"So I weep for that young man, his charm, his beauty, and his chastity until I die.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani said: Al-Hasan bin Ali told me: Ahmad bin al-Harith al-Kharraz told us from Al-Mada'ini from Abu Bakr al-Hudhali who said: When Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, released Al-Hutay'ah from his prison, he said to him: \"O Commander of the Faithful, write a letter for me to Alqama bin Ulatha so I may go to him, for you have forbidden me from earning through my poetry.\" He said: \"I will not do it.\" It was said to him: \"O Commander of the Faithful, what is it to you? Alqama is not your governor that you fear sinning regarding him; he is but a man of the Muslims you intercede for.\" So he wrote for him what he wanted. Al-Hutay'ah went with the letter and found Alqama had died, and people were leaving his grave. He stood over it and recited:\n\"By my life, excellent is the man from the family of Ja'far... in Hawran, whom the snares (of death) have caught.\nIf you live, I do not get bored, and if you die... then there is no benefit in life after your death.\nThere was nothing between me, had I met you safe,... and wealth except a few nights.\"\nHis son said to him: \"How much did you think Alqama would give you?\" He said: \"One hundred she-camels.\" He said: \"You have one hundred she-camels followed by one hundred of their offspring.\" So he gave them to him.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "And Abu al-Faraj also said: Abu Zayd told me: My uncle told me from his father from Ibn al-Kalbi from his father who said: A sheikh from Banu Nabhan told me: A famine struck Banu Shayban that took away their wealth. A man from them went out with his family until he settled them in Al-Hira. He said to them: 'Be close to the King so that some of his good may reach you, until I return to you.' He swore an oath upon himself not to return until he earned some good for them or died. He took provisions and walked for a day until night. He found a tied colt circling a tent. He said: 'This is the first booty.' He went to untie it and ride it, but a call came: 'Leave it and save yourself.' So he left it and walked for seven days until he reached a camel resting place as the sun was setting. There was a huge tent and a leather dome. He said: 'I said to myself: This tent must have people, this dome must have a master, and this resting place must have camels.' I looked into the tent and saw an old man whose collarbones differed (twisted), looking like a vulture. I sat behind him hiding. When the sun set, a knight approached; I never saw a knight greater or huger than him, on a tall horse, with two black slaves walking by his sides. There were a hundred camels with their stallion. The stallion knelt, and they knelt around it. He dismounted his horse and said to one of his slaves: 'Milk So-and-so then give the Sheikh to drink.' He milked into a large bowl until he filled it and placed it before the Sheikh and stepped aside. The Sheikh sipped from it once or twice then took it away. I rushed to it and drank it. The slave returned to him and said: 'O my master, he finished it.' He rejoiced at that and said to him: 'Milk So-and-so for him.' He milked it and placed the bowl before the Sheikh. He sipped one sip then took it away. I rushed to it and drank half of it, hating to finish it lest I be accused. The slave came, took it, and said to his master: 'He drank and quenched his thirst.' He said: 'Leave him.' Then he ordered a sheep slaughtered and roasted for the Sheikh. He ate, and he and his slaves ate. I waited until they slept and I heard snoring. I rushed to the stallion, untied its hobble, and rode it. It rushed off with me, and the camels followed. I traveled all night until morning. When morning came, I looked and saw no one. I drove them violently until the day rose high. Then I turned around and saw something like a bird. It kept getting closer until I distinguished it as a rider on a horse. It was my companion from yesterday. I hobbled the stallion, emptied my quiver, and stood between him and the camels. He stopped far away and said: 'Untie its hobble.' I said: 'No, by Allah. I left poor women in Al-Hira and swore an oath not to return until I benefit them with good or die.' He said: 'You are dead. Untie its hobble, may you have no mother.' I said: 'It is as I told you.' He said: 'You are deceived. Set up its halter for me and make five knots in it.' I did so. He said: 'Where do you want me to place my arrow?' I said: 'In this spot.' It was as if he placed it there with his hand. Then he began shooting until he hit the five knots with five arrows. I returned my arrows to my quiver, put down my bow, and stood surrendering. He approached me, took the sword and bow, and said: 'Ride behind me.' He recognized that I was the one who drank the milk at his place. He said: 'What is your opinion of me?' I said: 'The best opinion.' He said: 'How so?' I said: 'Because of the fatigue you faced last night, yet Allah gave you victory over me.' He said: 'Do you think we would harm you with evil when you spent the night drinking with Muhalhil?' I said: 'Are you Zayd al-Khayl?' He said: 'Yes, I am Zayd al-Khayl.' I said: 'Be the best captor.' He said: 'There is no harm on you.' He went to his place where he was, then said: 'If these camels were mine, I would have handed them to you, but they belong to the daughter of Muhalhil. Stay with me for I am on a high place.' I stayed with him for days. Then he raided Banu Numayr at Al-Milh and captured one hundred camels. He said: 'Is this dearer to you or that?' I said: 'This one.' He said: 'Take it.' He sent guides with me from water to water until they reached Al-Hira. A Nabataean met me and said: 'O Arab, would it please you to exchange these camels of yours for a garden among these gardens?' I said: 'How?' He said: 'This is the time a Prophet will emerge who will own this land and intervene between its owners and it, such that one of you will buy a garden for the price of a camel.' He said: I departed with my family until I reached a place. While we were at Al-Shattayn at a water of ours—Al-Hawfazan bin Sharik had raided Banu Tamim—the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, came to us, and we accepted Islam. Only days passed before I bought a garden in Al-Hira for the price of one camel of my camels.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "And he also said: Muhammad bin al-Husayn bin Durayd told me: Al-Harmani told us from Al-Abbas bin Hisham from his father: Utba bint Afif, the mother of Hatim al-Tai, was wealthy and was one of the most generous people and most hospitable to guests. She would not keep anything she owned. When her brothers saw her squandering her wealth, they quarantined her and withheld her money. She remained for a time with nothing given to her. Until they thought she had felt the pain of that, they gave her a small herd of her camels. A woman from Mazin came to her; she used to come to her every year asking. She said to her: 'Take this herd, it is yours. By Allah, I have suffered from hunger such that I will never refuse a beggar after it.' Then she recited:\n'By my life, hunger has bitten me a bite... so I swore not to withhold from a hungry one forever.\nSo tell this blamer today: Excuse me... for if you do not, then bite your fingers.\nWhat can you say to your sister... except your blame or the blame of one who denies?\nIs what you see today anything but nature... so how can I leave, O son of my mother, natures?'\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Haytham bin Adi—or Al-Qasim bin Adi—narrated from someone who told him from Malkhan, the nephew of Mawiya, Hatim's wife. He said: I said to Mawiya: 'O aunt, tell me some of the wonders of Hatim.' She said: 'All his affairs were wonders. Which one do you ask about?' I said: 'Tell me whatever you wish.' She said: 'A famine struck the people, destroying camels and sheep. One night, hunger kept me and him awake. He took Adi, and I took Suffana, and we tried to soothe them until they slept. Then he turned to me entertaining me with talk so I would sleep. I pitied his exhaustion, so I refrained from answering him so he would sleep. He said to me: \"Are you asleep?\" several times, but I did not answer. He fell silent. He looked and lifted the tent flap, and behold, something approached. He raised his head and it was a woman. He said: \"Who is this?\" She said: \"I am, O Abu Suffana, coming to you from children howling like wolves from hunger.\" He said: \"Bring me your children, by Allah I will satisfy them.\" She said: I got up quickly and said: \"With what, O Hatim? By Allah, your children did not sleep from hunger except by being soothed.\" He said: \"By Allah, I will satisfy your children along with hers.\" When she came, he went to his horse and slaughtered it. Then he struck a fire and kindled it. He gave her a knife and said: \"Roast and eat.\" Then he said to me: \"Wake up your children.\" I woke them up. Then he said: \"This is meanness, that you eat while the people of the encampment are in a state like yours.\" He went to the encampment, house by house, saying: \"Get up; come to the fire.\" They gathered around that horse. He wrapped himself in his cloak and sat aside. By morning, there was nothing of the horse left on the ground, little or much, except bone and hoof, while he was hungrier than them and had not tasted it.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Faraj said: Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Bazzaz al-Atrush told me: Ali bin Harb told us: Hisham bin Muhammad told us: Abu Miskin Ja'far bin al-Muhriz bin al-Walid told us from his father who said: My grandfather Al-Walid, a client of Abu Hurayra, said: I heard Muhriz bin Abu Hurayra speaking saying: A man called Abu al-Khaybari passed with a group of his people by Hatim's grave. Around it were opposing stones like women wailing. They camped by it. Abu al-Khaybari spent the whole night saying: 'O Abu Adi, host your guests.' They said to him: 'Wait, why do you speak to decaying bones?' He said: 'Tayy claims that no one ever stopped by him while he was dead but that he hosted him,' mocking him. When it was the end of the night, Abu al-Khaybari slept. At dawn, he jumped up shouting: 'O my camel!' His companions said: 'Woe to you, what is wrong?' He said: 'By Allah, Hatim came out with a sword while I was looking at him until he hamstrung my she-camel.' They said: 'You lied.' He said: 'Nay.' They looked at his camel, and it was struggling, unable to stand. They said: 'By Allah, he has hosted you.' They slaughtered it and spent the day eating its meat. Then they let him ride behind one of them and departed. They traveled for a while, then looked at a rider, and it was Adi bin Hatim leading a black camel. He caught up with them and said: 'Which of you is Abu al-Khaybari?' They said: 'This one.' He said: 'My father came to me in a dream and mentioned your insulting him and that he hosted your camel for your companions. He recited verses about that and repeated them to me until I memorized them:\n\"O Abu al-Khaybari, you are a man... oppressive to creation, insulting them.\nWhat did you want with bones... in a desert where their owl hooted?\nDo you seek his harm and insolvency... while around you is aid and his cattle?\nIndeed we feed our guests... from the herd, selecting them with the sword.\"\nHe ordered me to mount you on a camel, so here it is.' He took it, rode it, and they went.",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** He said: Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Bazzaz al-Atrush told me: Abu Miskin Ja'far bin al-Muhriz bin al-Walid told us from his father: Al-Waqidi said: Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi had claimed the Caliphate for himself in Rayy, and ruled it for one year, eleven months, and twelve days. He has many stories; the best of them in my opinion is what he told me. He said: When Al-Mamun entered Rayy and sought me most intensely, placing a reward of one hundred thousand dirhams for anyone who brought me, I feared for myself and became bewildered in my affair. I left my house at noon time—it was a summer day—not knowing where to head. I walked aimlessly until I ended up in a dead-end alley. I said: \"We belong to Allah and to Him we return. If I go back on my tracks, I will be suspected.\" I saw at the head of the alley a black slave standing at the door of his house. I approached him and said: \"Do you have a place where I can stay for an hour of the day?\" He said: \"Yes,\" and opened the door saying: \"O master, enter with welcome and space. I am yours, and the house is at your command.\" I entered a clean house with a clean mat and a leather pillow, but clean. Then he locked the door on me and left. I imagined he had heard the reward for me and went out to guide to me. I remained anxious like on fire. While I was like that, he arrived with a porter carrying everything needed of bread, meat, a new pot and its tools, a clean jar, and new cups. He unloaded from the porter then turned to me and said: \"May Allah make me your ransom. I am a cupper (barber), and I know you shrink from me because of my livelihood. So do as you please with what no hand has touched.\" I needed food, so I cooked a pot for myself; I do not remember eating the like of it. When I satisfied my need for food, he said: \"Would you like a drink, for it consoles worry, scents the mouth, improves the soul, and removes grief?\" I said: \"I do not dislike that,\" desiring to be friendly with him. He brought a new glass jar untouched by hands, and brought me two vessels of perfumed drink and said: \"Clarify for yourself.\" So I clarified a drink of utmost quality. He brought me a new cup, fruits, and snacks in new clay basins. Then he said: \"Do you permit me, may I be your ransom, to sit aside from you and drink some of my nabidh (date wine) out of joy for you?\" I said: \"Do so.\" He drank, and I drank three. Then he went into a closet of his and brought out a laminated lute and said: \"O master, it is not my rank to ask you to sing, but your nobility has obligated my sanctity upon you. If you see fit to honor your slave by singing for yourself, do so.\" I said: \"How did you know I sing well?\" He said with wonder: \"Glory be to Allah! You are more famous than that. You are Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi, our Caliph of yesterday, for whom Al-Mamun put a hundred thousand dirhams reward.\" He said: When he said that, his ambition and manliness grew in my eyes, and I knew his pride was greater than what was offered for me. I took the lute, fixed it, and sang, as separation from my family and children crossed my mind:\n'Perhaps He who returned his family to Joseph... and honored him in prison while he was a captive,\nWill respond to us and gather our union... for Allah is capable over all worlds.'\nHe said: \"O master, do you make what you sing what I requested of you?\" I said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"It occurred to me:\nIndeed He who tied the knot which tied... the knot of hardships upon you is good at untying it.\nSo be patient, for Allah follows with relief... perhaps it will clear, and perhaps.\"\nSo I sang it. I did not know its tune, but I composed it on the spot and took it as a good omen, and its rendition was good to me. I drank and drank. He said: \"It occurred to me, O master:\nDo not panic if you are in difficulty one day... for you have been in ease for a long time.\nAnd do not despair, for despair is disbelief... perhaps Allah will enrich from a little.\nAnd do not think of your Lord other than good... for Allah is worthy of beauty.\"\nI knew it, so I sang it. He drank and I drank. He said: \"I have a vow to Allah if you comfort me with your proximity—and I never thought time would allow your being in my house—if you see fit to sing:\nAnd if my soul disputes with me, I tell it: Be patient... death will relieve you or ascending the pulpit.\nWhat has been decreed for souls, be patient for it... and you have safety from what has not been decreed.\"\nI sang it, and his request pleased me, and I found it witty. Then he said: \"O master, do you permit me to sing what occurs to me, even if I am not of the people of this art?\" I said: \"An increase in your etiquette and manliness.\" He took the lute and sang:\n'We complained to our loved ones about the length of our night... They said to us: How short is the night with us!\nThat is because sleep covers their eyes... quickly, and sleep does not cover our eyes.\nWhen the night, harmful to the lover, approaches... we panic, and they rejoice when it approaches.\nIf they were encountering the like of what... we encounter, they would be like us in the beds.'\nBy Allah, I felt the verse carry me away, and all the panic in me left and I forgot it. I asked him to sing, so he sang:",

    "text": "'She taunts us that we are few in number... I said to her: Indeed, the noble are few.\nWhat harm is it to us that we are few and our neighbor... is honored, while the neighbor of the many is humiliated?\nWe are a people who do not see it as a disgrace... what Amir and Salul see.\nThe love of death brings our terms closer to us... and their terms hate it, so they grow long.'\n\nHe filled me with such delight that there was no more to add, until intoxication overtook me and him. I did not wake up until after sunset. My thought returned to the preciousness of this cupper, his good manners and wit, and how he requested from me songs intended to console me, and my singing which contained hints to his specialty. I stood up, washed my face, and woke him. I took a purse I had with me containing dinars of great value and threw it to him. I said to him: \"I entrust you to Allah, for I am leaving you. I ask you to spend what is in this purse on some of your needs, and you have with me more if I am safe from my fear.\" He returned it to me, denying it, and said: \"O master, the poor among us has no value to you people of leadership, and you think bad thoughts of him. Should I take a price for what time granted me of your proximity and staying with me?\" I insisted, so he pointed to his razor and said: \"By Allah, if you repeat that to me, I will kill myself.\" I feared for him, took the purse, and returned it to my sleeve, its weight burdening me. When I reached the door of his house resolving to leave, he said: \"O master, this place is more hidden for you than others, and I am not burdened by your provision, so stay with me until Allah grants you relief.\" I returned and asked him to spend from that purse, but he refused. Every day he did the like of what he did on the day of my arrival. I stayed some days in the best life. I felt guilty staying at his expense and was shy of burdening him, so I left him, while he continued renewing our conditions. I stood up, dressed in women's clothing with boots and veil, and left. When I was on the road, intense fear entered me. I came to cross the bridge, but the water had splashed on a spot making it slippery. A soldier who used to serve me saw me and recognized me. He said: \"This is Al-Mamun's need!\" and grabbed me. Out of love for life, I pushed him and his horse, throwing them into that slippery spot. He became a spectacle, and people rushed to kill him (or save him/beat him). I struggled walking until I crossed the bridge. I entered an alley and found a house door with a woman in its vestibule. I said: \"O mistress of women, save my blood, for I am a fearful man.\" She said: \"Welcome.\" She took me up to a room, furnished it for me, offered me food, and said: \"Calm your fear, for no creature knows you are with me, even if you stayed a year.\" She was with me in that when the door was knocked violently. She went out and opened the door. It was my companion whom I pushed on the bridge, his head bandaged, blood running on his clothes, without a horse. She said to him: \"What happened to you?\" He said to her: \"My story is strange. I obtained riches and they escaped me.\" She said: \"How so?\" He said: \"Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi, I met him and grabbed him, but he pushed me and the horse, so what you see happened to me, and he escaped. If I had brought him to Al-Mamun, I would have made a hundred thousand dirhams.\" She brought out a rag, treated his wound, bandaged it, made a bed for him in the hall, and he slept sick. She came up to me and said: \"I think you are the owner of the story.\" I said: \"Yes.\" She said: \"No harm on you.\" Then she renewed her hospitality to me, and I stayed with her for three days. Then she said: \"I fear for you from this man lest he discover your affair and inform on you, so save yourself.\" I asked her to delay me until night, and she did. When night entered, I wore women's clothes and left her. I came to the house of a former slave woman (mawlah) of mine. When she saw me, she wept, pained for me, and praised Allah for my safety. She went out as if she wanted the market to prepare hospitality, so I thought good. Before I knew it, Ibrahim al-Mawsili himself appeared with his cavalry, foot soldiers, and entourage, and the mawlah with him, until she handed me over to him. I saw death with my own eyes. I was carried in my attire to Al-Mamun. He sat in a public session and I was brought in. When I stood before him, I greeted him as Caliph. He said: \"May Allah not grant you peace, nor life, nor care.\" I said: \"Gently, O Commander of the Faithful. The avenger is the judge in retaliation, but forgiveness is closer to piety. Whoever is deceived by the extended ropes of hope is not safe from the aggression of fate. Allah Almighty has placed you above every pardon, just as He made every sin beneath your pardon. If you punish, it is by your right; and if you forgive, it is by your grace.\" Then I recited:\n'My sin against you is great... and you are greater than it.\nSo take your right first... then pardon with your clemency from it.\nIf I was not in my deeds... of the noble, then you be (of them).'\nHe raised his head to me, so I hastened and said:\n'I committed a great sin... and you are worthy of forgiveness.\nIf you forgive, it is grace... and if you punish, it is justice.'",

    "text": "Al-Mamun softened towards me, and I sensed the scents of mercy in his demeanor. Then he turned to his brother Abu Ishaq al-Mu'tasim, his son Al-Abbas, and all those present of his elite and said: 'What do you say regarding his matter?' All advised killing me, except they differed on how the killing should be. Al-Mamun said to Ahmad bin Abi Khalid: 'What do you say, O Ahmad?' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, if you kill him, I have found the likes of you who killed the likes of him; but if you forgive him, I have not found the likes of you who forgave the likes of him.' Al-Mamun lowered his head and began tapping the ground with his finger, reciting proverbially:\n'My people, they killed Umaym, my brother... So if I shoot, my arrow hits me.\nSo if I forgive, I forgive a great thing... And if I assault, I weaken my bone.'\nI uncovered the veil from my head and shouted 'Allahu Akbar' a great takbir and said: 'By Allah, the Commander of the Faithful has forgiven me.' Al-Mamun said: 'No harm on you, O uncle. Apologize.' I said: 'My sin, O Commander of the Faithful, is too great for me to utter an excuse with it, and your pardon is too great for me to speak gratitude with it. But I say:\nIndeed He who created noble traits gathered them... in the loin of Adam for the seventh Imam.\nThe hearts of people were filled with awe of you... and you continue to guard them with a humble heart.\nSo you forgave one whom the like of was never... forgiven, nor did an intercessor intercede with you for him.\nAnd you had mercy on children like sandgrouse chicks... and the yearning of a mother with an anxious heart.\nReturning life to me after it was gone... is the generosity of the Just, Humble King.'\nAl-Mamun said to me: 'There is no blame on you today. I have forgiven you and returned your wealth and estates to you.' I said:\n'You returned my wealth and were not stingy with it to me... and before returning my wealth, you spared my blood.\nI felt safe from you, and you bestowed favors on me... excellent are the two lives: from death and from non-existence.\nIf I sacrificed my blood seeking your pleasure with it... and wealth until I pull the shoe from my foot,\nThat would be nothing but a loan returned... to you; had you not gifted it, you would not be blamed.\nKindness to me from you is treading the excuse you have for me... in what I committed, so you did not chide or blame.\nIf I denied what you bestowed of favors... I would be more worthy of blame than you of generosity.'\nAl-Mamun said: 'Indeed, among speech is speech like pearls, and this is of it.' He ordered money and robes for Ibrahim and said: 'O Ibrahim, Abu Ishaq and Al-Abbas advised killing you.' I said: 'They gave you sincere advice, O Commander of the Faithful, but you refused except what you are worthy of, and repelled what I feared with what I hoped.' Al-Mamun said: 'My malice has died with the life of your excuse, and I have forgiven you. Greater than my forgiving you is that I did not make you swallow the bitterness of indebtedness to intercessors.' Then Al-Mamun prostrated for a long time, then raised his head and said: 'O Ibrahim, do you know why I prostrated?' I said: 'In thanks to Allah who granted you victory over the enemy of your state.' He said: 'I did not intend that, but thanks to Allah for inspiring me to forgive you. Now tell me your story.' I explained to him the situation of my affair and what happened to me with the cupper, the soldier, and the mawlah who handed me over. Al-Mamun ordered the mawlah to be brought while she was in her house awaiting the reward. He said to her: 'What drove you to do what you did despite Ibrahim and his family's kindness to you?' She said: 'Desire for money.' He asked her: 'Do you have a child or husband?' She said: 'No.' He ordered her to be flogged two hundred lashes and imprisoned for life. Then he said: 'Bring the soldier, his wife, and the cupper.' They were brought. He asked the soldier about the reason that drove him to do what he did. He said: 'Desire for money.' Al-Mamun said to him: 'You are more fitting to be a cupper than to be among our allies.' He appointed someone to force him to sit in the cupper's shop to learn cupping. He employed his wife, after treating her well, as a housekeeper in his palace, saying: 'This is a wise, polite woman suitable for important tasks.' Then he said to the cupper: 'There has appeared from your manliness what necessitates preserving you.' He handed him the soldier's house and beast, gave him robes, and established him with his salary plus an increase of a thousand dinars every year. He continued in good condition until he died.\n\n**Anecdote:** Sulayman bin Wahb narrated: When Al-Wathiq persecuted me, he said to Muhammad bin Abd al-Malik al-Zayyat: 'Torture Sulayman, restrict him, confiscate him, and demand the money.' Sulayman said: 'So he dressed me in a wool jubba, shackled me, and restricted me. He used to bring me to Al-Wathiq's house and address me with the harshest address, threaten me, and treat me with the ugliest and most hideous treatment. Informers would write this to Al-Wathiq, and it would please him. When it was night, Muhammad bin Abd al-Malik ordered my shackles removed and my clothes changed. He would lay out a prayer rug for me, keep me company, eat and drink with me, consult me in his affairs, and confide his secrets to me. When it was time for me to leave him, he would tap my shoulder with his hand and say: \"O Abu Ayyub, this is the right of friendship, and that is the right of the Sultan. Do not deny this, nor deny that.\" So I would thank him for his deed. When it was tomorrow, we returned to what we were on, as if we did not know each other.'\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Hammad bin Ishaq narrated from his father who said: I entered upon Al-Fadl bin al-Rabi'. Al-Rashid had been informed about Yahya bin Abdullah bin al-Hasan, whom he had ordered him to kill. He (Al-Rashid) did not reveal to him that he heard about him releasing him, but asked him about his news: 'Did you kill him?' He said: 'No.' He said to him: 'Where is he?' He said: 'I released him.' He said: 'Why?' He said: 'Because he asked me by the right of Allah Almighty and His Messenger and his kinship to him and to you, and swore to me that he would not cause any event and that he would come to me whenever I requested him.' He (Al-Rashid) looked down for an hour, then said to him: 'Go yourself in search of him until you bring him to me, and leave immediately.' So he left. Ishaq said: I entered upon him congratulating him on safety. I said to him: 'I have never seen a firmer heart nor a more correct opinion than yours in what happened. You are, by Allah, as Ashja' said:\nHis intuition and thought are equal... when a great calamity befalls him.\nThe most decisive time in opinion... is when the consultant and advisor are incapable.\nAnd a chest in which there is room for worry... when chests are narrowed by worry.'\nAl-Fadl said: 'Look how much Ashja' was given for this poem and carry the like of it to Abu Muhammad.' He said: It was found that he had taken thirty thousand dirhams, so they were carried to me.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani said: ... Ibn Aisha said: Hisham bin Abd al-Malik performed Hajj during the caliphate of his brother Al-Walid, accompanied by the people of Sham. He struggled to touch the Black Stone but could not due to the crowding of people. A pulpit was set up for him, and he sat on it looking at the people. Zain al-Abidin Ali bin al-Husayn, may Allah be pleased with them, approached. He was the most handsome of people in face, cleanest in dress, and best in scent. He circled the House. When he reached the Stone, the people all moved aside for him and cleared the Stone for him to touch, out of awe and reverence for him. This enraged Hisham and affected him. A man said to Hisham: 'Who is this, may Allah amend the Emir?' He said: 'I do not know him'—though he knew him well—but he feared the people of Sham would desire him and listen to him. Al-Farazdaq, who was present for all this, said: 'I know him, so ask me, O Sham, who he is.' He said: 'And who is he?' He said:\n'This is he whose footprint the valley of Mecca knows... and the House knows him, and the Hill and the Sanctuary.\nThis is the son of the best of all Allah's servants... This is the pious, the pure, the clean, the banner.\nIn his hand is a cane whose scent is fragrant... In the hand of a noble one, having a high nose bridge.\nHe lowers his gaze out of modesty, and gaze is lowered out of awe of him... He is not spoken to except when he smiles.\nWhen Quraysh sees him, their speaker says:... To the noble traits of this one, generosity is attributed.\nThe corner of the Hatim almost holds onto... the palm of his hand when he comes to touch it.\nYour saying \"Who is this?\" does not harm him... The Arabs know whom you denied, and the non-Arabs.\nWhich creatures do not have on their necks... a favor from his priority or from him?\nWhoever knows Allah knows the priority of this one... For religion from the house of this one reached the nations.'\nHisham imprisoned him. Al-Farazdaq said:\n'Does he imprison me between Medina and the one... to which the hearts of people yearn turning?\nTurning a head that was not the head of a master... and a cross-eye showing its defects.'\nHisham sent for him and released him fearing his tongue. Ali bin al-Husayn sent him ten thousand dirhams and said: 'Excuse us, O Abu Firas, if we had more than this at this time, we would have connected you with it.' He returned it and said: 'What I said was only for Allah, and I would not take anything from you for it.' Ali bin al-Husayn said to him: 'Allah has seen your place and thanked you, but we are a household; if we send something, we do not take it back.' He swore upon him, so he accepted it.\n\n**Anecdote:** Ahmad bin Yahya al-Makki said: Ishaq al-Mawsili used to praise the Barmakids frequently and exaggerate in eulogizing them. He attended the assembly of Al-Fadl bin al-Rabi' one day and mentioned the Barmakids. This used to enrage Al-Fadl and affect him greatly. Some of those present said to Ishaq: 'Will you not cease mentioning these people and stop that, while you have in praising the Vizier what would reach the highest ranks with him and occupy the loftiest place in his soul?' Al-Fadl withheld from speaking, pleased with how Ishaq was addressed. Ishaq said: 'As for the Barmakids, my adherence to them, my love for them, and my praise of them are too famous to deny, and that, by Allah, is the least they deserve from me.' Then he turned to Al-Fadl, whose praise of them had enraged him. He said to him: 'Hear from me one thing of what they did for me; it is not great among their favors to me nor to my father before me. If you find an excuse for me in that, then do so; otherwise, do not.",

    "text": "At the beginning of my affair, I was living with my father in his house. Disputes would constantly occur between my slaves and his slaves, and my maids and his maids, as happens between these classes. They would complain to him, and I would notice annoyance and disapproval in his face. So I rented a house near him and moved to it with my maids and slaves. It was a spacious house, but I was not satisfied with the furnishings I had for it, nor for my friends who visited me to see the like at my place. I thought about that and how to handle it. My thinking increased until the ugliness of the gossip about someone like me living in a rented house crossed my mind, and that I was not safe from a time when permission to enter might be asked while I had someone I respected who didn't know my situation, and it would be said: \"Your landlord is asking for the rent.\" My chest tightened severely because of that, exceeding the limit. I ordered my slaves to saddle a donkey I had so I could go to the open country to relieve myself of what entered my heart. It was saddled for me, and I put on a cloak and sandals and rode. The path led me, while I was thinking and not distinguishing the road I was taking, until I suddenly arrived at the door of Yahya bin Khalid. His slaves jumped to me and said: \"Where is this road?\" I said: \"To the Vizier, may Allah honor him.\" They asked permission for me to enter, so I entered. I remained ashamed, having fallen into two ugly matters: if I entered upon him with a cloak and sandals and told him I intended him in that state, it would be bad manners; and if I told him I was passing by and did not intend you but made you a path, it would be ugly. Then I resolved to tell him the truth. When he saw me, he smiled and said: \"What is this attire, O Abu Muhammad? Did we count for you intention, purpose, and visitation, then learned you made us a path?\" I said: \"No, by Allah, may Allah support the Vizier, but I will tell you the truth.\" He said: \"Bring it.\" I told him the story from beginning to end. He said: \"This is a valid right. Did this occupy your heart?\" I said: \"Yes, by Allah, and more.\" He said: \"Do not occupy your heart with this. O boy, return his donkey and bring him a robe.\" They brought me a complete robe of his clothes, and I wore it. He called for food, and I ate. He placed the wine, and I drank and he drank, and I sang for him. In the midst of that, he called for an inkwell and wrote four notes which I thought some of might be a signature for a reward for me. Then he called one of his agents, gave him the notes, and whispered something to him. My hope for a reward increased. The man left, and we sat drinking while I waited, seeing nothing but the enjoyment. Then Yahya bin Khalid leaned back and slept. I stood up from his presence broken and disappointed. I went out, my donkey was brought to me, I rode it and traveled. When I passed the house, my slave said to me: \"Where are you going?\" I said: \"To the house.\" He said: \"By Allah, the house has been sold, and the whole alley has been bought, witnesses testified against its owners, the price has been weighed, and the buyer is sitting at your door waiting for you to identify you. I think he bought that for the Sultan,\" because I saw the matter in his haste and urgency as a Sultani matter. I fell from that into a matter not in my calculation. I traveled not knowing what to do. When I dismounted at the door of my house, the agent to whom Yahya whispered stood up to me and said: \"Enter your house, may Allah support you, so I can enter into a matter in which I need to speak to you.\" My soul felt good, so I entered, and he entered with me. He read to me a signature from Yahya granting Abu Muhammad Ishaq one hundred thousand dirhams to buy his house and all that neighbors and adjoins it. The second signature to his son Al-Fadl: \"I have ordered Abu Ishaq one hundred thousand dirhams to buy his house; release for him another hundred thousand to spend on fixing the house as he wishes and building it as he desires.\" The third signature to his son Ja'far: \"I have ordered Abu Muhammad Ishaq one hundred thousand to buy a house to live in, and your brother ordered him one hundred thousand dirhams to spend on building and repairing it as he wants; so release for him one hundred thousand dirhams to buy furnishings to exchange in it.\" The fourth signature to Muhammad: \"I and your brothers have ordered Abu Muhammad Ishaq three hundred thousand dirhams for a house to buy, expenses to spend on it, and furnishings to exchange in it; so order for him yourself one hundred thousand dirhams to spend on the rest of his expenses.\" The agent said to me: \"I have carried the money and bought everything neighboring you for seventy thousand dirhams. These are the deeds of purchase in my name and the acknowledgment to you. Here is the money, may it be blessed for you, take it.\" So I took it, and I became in better condition than my father in my house and all my furnishings and tools. Nay, by Allah, this is not one of the biggest things they did for me. Am I to be blamed for thanking them?\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "It is said that Muawiyah's companions discussed in his presence one day the noble people and those of status and illustrious houses, while Al-Husayn bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them, was present. Muawiyah said: \"Who do you know as the most generous of people in terms of father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, uncle, aunt (paternal), uncle, and aunt (maternal)?\" They said: \"The Commander of the Faithful knows best.\" He took the hand of Al-Husayn bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them, and said: \"This one. His father is Ali bin Abi Talib, his mother is Fatima daughter of Muhammad, his grandfather is the Messenger of Allah, his grandmother is Khadija, his uncle is Ja'far bin Abi Talib, his paternal aunt is Hala bint Abi Talib, his maternal uncle is Al-Qasim son of the Messenger of Allah, and his maternal aunt is Zaynab daughter of Muhammad.\" All of them said: \"The Commander of the Faithful spoke the truth.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani said in his book: ... that Ubaydullah bin Abi Bakra wrote to Yazid bin Abi Rabi'a bin Mufrigh: \"I have headed to Sijistan, so join me. Perhaps if you come to me, you will not regret it nor blame your opinion.\" Ibn Mufrigh prepared himself and went out until he came to Sijistan in the evening. He entered upon him, so he busied him with conversation and ordered a house, furnishings, and servants for him. He delayed him until he knew he had completed what was ordered for him, then dismissed him to the house prepared for him. Then he called for him on the second day and said to him: \"O Ibn Mufrigh, you have endured a long journey to me, and your hope has expanded. You traveled to me so I would pay your debt for you and enrich you from people, and you said: 'Abu Hatim in Sijistan is capable of making me rich after him.'\" He said: \"By Allah, O Emir, you have not missed anything of what was in my soul.\" Ubaydullah said: \"By Allah, I will do that, I will reduce your stay with me, and I will improve your gift.\" He ordered one hundred thousand dirhams, one hundred maidservants, and one hundred noble camels for him. He ordered for him what he would spend until he reached his country apart from the hundred thousand, and enough servants and clients to serve him. He said to him: \"Part of the lightness of travel is not to worry about hoof or camel.\" His stay with him was seven days. Then he departed, and Ubaydullah bin Abi Bakra saw him off to a village four parasangs away called Zaliq. Then he said to him: \"O Ibn Mufrigh, it is fitting for the bidder of farewell to leave and the speaker to fall silent. I am whom you have known. Spend on hope, and improve your opinion of me and your hope in me. If it occurs to you to return, then return. Peace.\" Ibn Mufrigh traveled until Ahvaz. Ubaydullah's messengers returned from him and said: \"We have reached where we were ordered.\" He said: \"Yes.\" Then he ordered Anahid bint A'naq, a woman he loved, to open the door, and said to her: \"Everything that enters your house is yours.\" He stayed in Ahvaz and invited boon companions he had among the Arab youths. No wit or singer remained but came to him. A group of people from Basra, Kufa, and Sham sought his generosity, and he gave to them. He did not leave Anahid with any money. The people began asking him about Ubaydullah bin Abi Bakra and how he and his morals and generosity were. He said:\n\"The people of Iraq ask me about generosity... I said Ubaydullah is the ally of noble traits.\nA Hatim-like youth, his saddle is in Sijistan... It is enough generosity for you that he is like Hatim.\nHe rose to attain honors and attained them... with the strength of a lion and the giving of dirhams.\nAnd forbearance, when the fit of war is unleashed... he grants the people during the worsening calamity.\nHe has a favor in every tribe... discussed by riders and people of the seasons (Hajj).\nHis generosity and loyalty invited me to him... and beyond his night journey are the enemies of the non-Arabs.\nI stayed only a week in his neighborhood... and two days lawful from the oath of a sinner.\nUntil he bid me farewell, adorned by Allah with loftiness... and grew the broken feathers of my wing.\nHe said: If you wish, O Ibn Mufrigh... then return a return that is not like the confused dreams of a sleeper.\nI said to him: May Allah not make his house far... I will return if I come to you without retinue.\nI praised my arrival when I arrived at his pools... and every generous one is an opportunity for the noble.\nSo he became hoping for nothing from Iraq and its people... neither for benefit nor for repelling great misfortunes.\nIndeed Ubaydullah prepared his support... freely and gave his good without sterility.\"\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "And Abu al-Faraj also said: ... Al-Qahdhami said: Yazid bin Mufrigh's creditors stuck to him for a debt. He said to them: 'Let us go sit at the door of Prince Isa until the nobles come out and see me, so they pay my debt for me.' So they went with him. The first to come out was either Umar bin Ubaydullah bin Ma'mar or Talha al-Talhat. When he saw him, he said: 'Abu Uthman, what seated you here?' He said: 'These creditors of mine stuck to me for a debt I owe.' He said: 'How much is it?' He said: 'Seventy thousand.' He said: 'Ten thousand dirhams of it are on me.' Then the other came out afterwards and asked him what his companion asked. He said: 'Did anyone come out before me?' They said: 'Yes, So-and-so.' He said: 'What did he do?' They said: 'He guaranteed ten thousand dirhams.' He said: 'The like of it is on me.' People kept coming out; some guaranteeing a thousand up to more than that, until they guaranteed forty thousand. He was hoping for Ubaydullah bin Abi Bakra, but he did not come out until the sun set. He came out rushing and did not see him until he almost reached his house. It was said to him: 'You passed by Ibn Mufrigh who is detained, and nobles passed by him and guaranteed for him.' He said: 'What a shame! I fear he thinks I ignored him.' He turned back and found him sitting. He said to him: 'Abu Uthman, what seats you here?' He said: 'These creditors of mine are detaining me.' He said: 'How much do you owe?' He said: 'Seventy thousand.' He said: 'How much was guaranteed for you?' He said: 'Forty thousand.' He said: 'Enjoy them, and your entire debt is on me.' He said about him:\n'If you wished, you would not suffer nor toil... You lived by the means of Abu Hatim.\nYou lived by the means of the generous one who... does not seal wealth with a seal.\nFrom the hand of a chief who has equipment... such that whoever opposes him has no protector.\nThe feeder of people when... their winds withhold rain in the fierce time.\nAnd the decider of the plan on the day of dispute... for the matter necessary at distress.\nI neighbored him for a time and praised him... I praise, and the praiser is not like the blamer.\nHow many a hating, gloating enemy... did you disgrace one day, and how many a tyrant,\nDid you make taste death by surprise... with a sharp sword of white luster.'\n\n**Anecdote:** He also said: ... Yahya bin Urwa bin Udhayna said: My father and a group of poets came to Hisham bin Abd al-Malik. He asked their lineage, and they identified themselves. When he recognized my father, he said to him: \"Are you the one who says:\n'I have known, and the ambition is not behind me... that what is my provision will come to me.\nI strive for it, and seeking it wearies me... and if I sat, it would come to me causing me no fatigue.\nIndeed, the luck of a person other than me will reach him... inevitably, inevitably, he will possess it without me.\nThere is no good in greed that brings one close to deficiency... and a little of sufficient living suffices me.\nI do not ride a matter whose consequences are shameful... nor is my honor or religion faulted by it.\nHow many a poor man, rich of soul, do you know... and how many a rich man, poor of soul, is destitute.\nAnd an enemy who shot at me, had I sat for him... would not have taken half from me when shooting me.\nAnd a brother of mine who turned away, I said to him... Indeed your turning away from me will fold me up.\nI indeed speak in what is my concern... and increase silence in what does not concern me.\nI do not seek the connection of one who seeks my separation... nor do I soften for one who does not desire my softness.'\"\nIbn Udhayna said to him: \"Yes, I am the one who said it.\" He said: \"Then why didn't you sit in your house until your provision came to you?\" Hisham neglected him, so he left immediately, mounted his camel, and departed. Hisham missed him and learned his news. He sent a reward after him and said to the messenger: \"Say to him: You wanted to make us liars and prove yourself truthful.\" The messenger went and caught up with him while he had stopped at a water place having lunch. He delivered the message and gave him the reward. He said: \"Tell him my Lord proved me truthful and you a liar.\" Yahya bin Urwa said: He assigned him two stipends, and I was in one of them.\n\n**Anecdote:** And Abu al-Faraj also said: ... Yazid bin Mazyad entered upon Al-Rashid. He said to him: \"O Ibn Mazyad, who says about you:\n'Perfume does not cling to his cheeks and parting... nor does he wipe his eyes with kohl.\nHe has accustomed the birds to habits they trusted... so they follow him in every departure.'\"\nHe said: \"I do not know who said it, O Commander of the Faithful.\" Harun said to him: \"Is such poetry said about you and you do not know its speaker?\" He left his presence ashamed. When he arrived at his house, he called his chamberlain and said: \"Which poet is at the door?\" He said: \"Muslim bin al-Walid.\" He said: \"And how did you block him from me and not inform me of his presence?\" He said: \"I told him you are in straits and have nothing in your hand to give him, and asked him to wait and stay for days until you have means.\" He denied that from him and said: \"Let him in.\" He entered and recited his saying about him:",

The intelligence officer wrote about that to Al-Rashid, so he ordered two hundred thousand dirhams for him and said: \"Pay the fifty thousand the poet took and add the like to it, and take one hundred thousand for yourself.\" So he redeemed his estate and gave Muslim another fifty thousand.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that Mukhariq loved a maid of Umm Ja'far named Nhar. He was infatuated with her, hiding it from Umm Ja'far until it reached her. She distanced him and banned him from passing her door. When he knew the news reached Umm Ja'far, he cut ties and avoided her out of reverence for Umm Ja'far and hoping to forget her. He became distressed by that. While he was one night in a boat returning from Al-Mamun's house, and Umm Ja'far was overlooking the Tigris, he passed her house. He saw candles shining in it. When he was within hearing and sight of her, he burst into singing poetry by Al-Abbas al-Ahnaf:\n'If they ban my passing near their house... I will look from afar at the house.\nThey cannot ban me, even if they try hard... if I pass and my greeting is hidden.\nWhat harm would it do your neighbors, may Allah amend them... were it not for my misery, my approach and retreat?\nThe mark of love was publicized until I became known by it... that I am a lover, and there is no shame in love.'\nUmm Ja'far said: \"Mukhariq, by Allah! Bring him back.\" They shouted to him, so he came. The servants ordered him to ascend, so he ascended. Umm Ja'far ordered a chair and a tray with wine for him. He drank, and she gave him a robe. She ordered the maids to sing, then they played for him, so he sang. The first thing he sang was also poetry by Al-Abbas:\n'I am absent from you with a love not changed by... distance of place nor turn of time.\nIf I live, perhaps time will gather us... and if I die, then a victim of worry and sadness.\nAllah has beautified what you did in my eyes... until I see as beautiful what is not beautiful.'\nHe said: Nhar burst into singing as if following him, but she answered the meaning he alluded to:\n'You use busyness as an excuse not to visit us... The busyness is for the heart, the busyness is not for the body.'\nUmm Ja'far thought she addressed her with what was in her soul, so she laughed and said: \"We have not heard better than what you two did,\" and she gifted her to him.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu Zayd said: Some Arabs raided the livestock of Ahmad bin Anqa' al-Fazari and drove them away until nothing remained. He came to his nephew and said to him: \"O son of my brother, what you see has befallen your uncle, so is there any milking animal?\" He said: \"Yes, uncle, when the wealth returns (in the evening), attain your desire.\" When his wealth returned, he divided it with him and gave him half. Ibn Anqa' said:\n'He saw me suffering from what was in me, so he complained... to his wealth about my condition, secretly as if openly.\nHe called me and consoled me, and if he were stingy I wouldn't blame... at a time when no Bedouin is hoped for nor city dweller.\nSo I said good to him and praised his deed... and fulfilled what you wore out of blame or thanks.\nA youth whom Allah threw with good while young... having a sign not hard on the sight.\nAs if the Pleiades were hung on his forehead... and on his cheek Sirius and on his face the moon.\nWhen he saw glory, his clothes were reclaimed... he wore a wide-tailed robe and wrapped himself.\nIf a flaw appeared, he turned away as if... humiliated without humiliation, and if he wished he would triumph.'\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "From Ibn Umar, who said: Ishaq bin Ibrahim al-Zahiri saw the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, in his dream saying to him: \"Release the killer.\" He woke up terrified, called for a candle, and brought the letters arriving from the jailers. He did not see a mention of a killer in them. He ordered Al-Sindi and Abbas to be brought and asked them about the news. Abbas said to him: \"Yes, we wrote with news of a killer.\" He re-examined them and found the letter in the folds of papers. There was a man against whom testimony of killing was given, and he confessed to it. He ordered him brought. When he stood before him and he saw his terror, he said to him: \"If you tell me the truth, I will release you.\" He began informing him. He mentioned that he and a number with him used to commit every enormity and permit every forbidden act. Their meeting was in the city of Abu Ja'far, keeping to every calamity. One day, an old woman who used to visit them for corruption came to them with a girl of outstanding beauty. He said: When the girl reached the middle of the house and saw us, she screamed a scream and fainted. When she woke up, she said: \"For God's sake regarding me! This old woman deceived me and informed me that among her neighbors were people who had a right (party/event) like never seen, and made me long to look at it. I went out with her trusting her word, and she attacked me with you. My grandfather is the Messenger of Allah, my mother is Fatima, and my father is Al-Husayn bin Ali, so preserve them in me.\" It was as if, by Allah, she only incited them with herself. I stood up for her and defended her, fighting those who wanted her until I received wounds. I aimed at the most intense of them—he was like their dog in her affair—and killed him. The girl got free from him safe, and I brought her out safe. I heard her say addressing me: \"May Allah cover you as you covered me, and be for you as you were for me.\" The neighbors heard a noise and entered upon us. The knife was in my hand, and the man was wallowing in his blood. I was raised in that state. Ishaq said: \"I have known what was from you, and I have gifted you to Allah and His Messenger.\" The man said: \"By the right of the One you gifted me to, I will never return to a sin again.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani raised it to Ali bin Umar, said: Muslim bin al-Walid, known as Sari' al-Ghawani, told me: I was sitting one day in a tailor's shop opposite my house when I saw a knocker at my door. I stood up to him, and it was a friend of mine from Kufa who had arrived from Qom. I was happy with him. He was a person who slapped my face (i.e., shamed me) because I did not have a single dirham to spend on him. I stood up, greeted him, brought him into my house, and took two boots I had for dressing up. I gave them to my maid and wrote a note with her to an acquaintance in the market asking him to sell the boots and buy me meat and bread for a price I named. The maid went and returned having bought all I specified, having sold the boots for nine dirhams. It was as if she brought me two new boots. I sat cooking with my guest, and I asked a neighbor to give us a bottle of nabidh (wine). He sent it to me. I ordered the maid to lock the door fearing a knocker would come and share what we were in, hoping what we had would remain for me and him until he left.\n\nWe were sitting cooking when the door was knocked. I said to the maid: \"Look who this is.\" She looked through the crack of the door and said it was a man wearing black, a Shashiyya (cap), and a belt, accompanied by a lackey. She told me his position, and I denied my affair (feigned ignorance/hid). Then I returned to myself and said: \"I am not a man of vice, nor does the Sultan have a way against me.\" I opened the door and went out to him. He dismounted his beast and said: \"Are you Muslim bin al-Walid?\" I said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"How can I verify you?\" I said: \"The one who guided you to my house can verify me.\" He said to his slave: \"Go to the tailor and ask him about him.\" He went and asked, and he said: \"Yes, he is Muslim bin al-Walid.\" He brought out a letter from his boot and said: \"This is a letter from Emir Yazid bin Mazyad to me ordering me not to break its seal except upon meeting you.\" He broke it, and in it was: \"If you meet Muslim bin al-Walid, give him these ten thousand dirhams I have sent; let them be for him in his house. And give him three thousand dirhams for his expenses to travel to us.\" I took the three and the ten and entered my house. The man was with me. We ate that food, and I added to it and the drink. I bought fruit and expanded. I gave my guest some of the dirhams to buy a gift for his family. I started preparing (for travel). Then I remained with him until we arrived in Raqqa at the door of Yazid bin Mazyad. The man entered; he was one of his chamberlains. He found him in the bath. He came out to me and sat with me a little. Then the chamberlain informed me he left the bath. He brought me in, and there he was sitting on a chair. At his head was a maid holding a mirror case, and in his hand were a mirror and a comb with which he was combing his beard. He said to me: \"O Muslim, what delayed you from us?\" I said: \"O Emir, lack of means.\" He said: \"Recite to me.\" I recited my poem I came to him with:\n'I dragged the rope of a dissolute in youth, flirtatious... and the determinations of blamers fell short of blaming me.'\nWhen I reached my saying:",

    "text": "'Perfume does not cling to his cheeks and parting... nor does he wipe his eyes with kohl.'\nHe put the mirror in its case and said to the maid: \"Leave, for Muslim has forbidden perfume for us.\" When I finished the poem, he said to me: \"O Muslim, do you know what drove me to send for you?\" I said: \"No, by Allah, I do not know.\" He said: \"I was with Al-Rashid nights ago squeezing his feet when he said to me: 'O Yazid, do you know who says about you:\nAsk the Caliph for a sword of Banu Matar... passing through, piercing intestines and skulls.\nLike time, he does not turn away from what he intends... he has encompassed people with bounty and compulsion.'\nI said: 'No, by Allah, I do not know.' Al-Rashid said: 'Glory be to Allah, you remain in your Bedouin ways! Such poetry is said about you, and you do not know who said it?' I asked about its speaker and was told it was you. 'Stand up so I can bring you to the Commander of the Faithful.' He stood up and entered upon Al-Rashid. Before long, the usher came out to me. I entered upon Al-Rashid and recited to him what poetry I had about him. He ordered one hundred thousand dirhams for me, and Yazid ordered ninety thousand, saying: 'It is not permissible that I give you the like of what the Commander of the Faithful gave you.' He gave me land grants whose revenue reached two hundred thousand dirhams.\"\n\nMuslim said: Then matters led after that to him angering me, so I satirized him. He complained about me to Al-Rashid. He summoned me and said: \"Will you sell me Yazid's honor?\" I said: \"Yes, O Commander of the Faithful.\" He said: \"For how much?\" I said: \"For a loaf of bread.\" He became angry until I feared for myself, and said: \"I thought I would buy it from you for a huge sum, but I will not do it, and no honor (to you). You have known his kindness to you 'I am banished from my father by Allah' (an oath), by Allah if I hear that you satirized him, I will tear your tongue from between your jaws.\" So I refrained from him after that and mentioned him neither with good nor evil.\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Waqidi said: I had two friends, one Hashimite and the other Nabataean. We were like one soul. I suffered severe distress, and Eid arrived. My wife said to me: \"As for us, we can be patient with misery and hardship, but as for these children of ours, my heart is torn with pity for them because they see the neighbors' children adorned for their Eid while they are in this state. If only you could devise something to spend on their clothes.\" I wrote to my Hashimite friend asking him to expand on me from what was available. He sent me a sealed purse mentioning it had a thousand dirhams. It had barely settled when my other friend wrote to me complaining of what I complained to my companion. I sent the purse to him as it was and went out to the mosque. I spent my night shy of my wife. When I entered upon her, she approved of that and did not blame me for it. While I was like that, my Hashimite friend arrived with the purse in its state and said: \"Tell me the truth about what you did with what I sent you.\" I told him the news plainly. He said: \"You sent to me while I owned nothing on earth except what I sent you. I wrote to our friend asking him for help, and he sent me my purse with my seal.\" He said: We took out one hundred dirhams for the woman and divided the rest among us in thirds. The news reached Al-Mamun, so he summoned me and asked me about it. I explained it to him, so he ordered seven thousand dinars for us: one thousand for the woman and two thousand for each one of us.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani said: Ahmad bin Abi Tahir told me: Abu Du'ama Ali bin Yazid told me: Al-Tamimi or Muhammad told me: I entered upon Al-Hasan bin Sahl and recited a eulogy for Al-Mamun and a eulogy for him. Tahir bin al-Husayn was with him. Tahir said to him: \"This, by Allah, O Emir, is the one who says about Muhammad the Deposed (Al-Amin):\n'There must be drunkenness upon delight... perhaps a spirit will be relieved from distress.\nThe Caliph of Allah, best chosen one... for the best mother from Hashim and father.\nThe Caliphate of Allah inherited by... his fathers in the ancient books.\nIt is for you... inherited... from the Seal of Prophets in eras.\nO son of him who is in the peaks of... ancient honor, you are the pillars of the Arabs.'\nAl-Hasan said: \"By Allah, the son of the uncircumcised woman insinuated against the Commander of the Faithful. By Allah, I will inform him.\" He stood up to Al-Mamun and informed him. Al-Mamun said to him: \"What is against him in that? A man hoped in a man and praised him. By Allah, he was good to us and bad to him, since he did not draw near to him except by drinking wine.\" Then he summoned me, gave me a robe, and ordered ten thousand dirhams for me.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said Abd al-Malik bin Marwan went out to Al-Ghouta for a picnic. While traveling, he passed a bridge erected over some of its waters. The army had lagged behind him, and he was separated from his entourage. When he came down from the bridge, a man of the Arabs on a horse came to him. This alarmed him. He said to him: \"Who are you and what is your business?\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, I am one of the knights of the Arabs. My hope in you and the reliance of the needy upon you called me to you. Return me to my family safe, and from your wealth amply provided and gaining.\" He said: \"O brother of the Arabs, have you not heard the poet's saying:",

    "text": "'Disobey the blamers and shoot arrows broadly... with a horse enduring a night of trotting.\nUntil you acquire wealth or it is said: A youth... met what splits young men, so he was split.\nThere is no good in a youth whose manliness has perished... giving leadership to one who does not lead well.'\nHe said: \"And did the poet say that, O Commander of the Faithful?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"I will act by what he said. Peace be upon you.\" He turned his horse and left. When he disappeared from Abd al-Malik's sight and his army caught up with him, he advanced in pursuit of the man but did not catch him. Then time struck its blows. It was reported to Abd al-Malik that a man of the Arabs rebelled in some regions, a group joined him, and money being carried to Abd al-Malik was intercepted by him. Abd al-Malik sent an army against him and defeated him. Then the days did not last long until his affair worsened and his power intensified. Abd al-Malik wrote to him asking what drove him to leave obedience and duel in war. He wrote back: \"I am the knight of Al-Ghouta; I have done what you advised, and I have seen nothing but good from it until now.\" Abd al-Malik wrote to him enticing him, granting him safety, and promising that if he came to him obediently, he would reward him well. He carried a sum of money to him. He returned to him, leaving what he was involved in, and became one of the foremost with him, and his service was good.\n\n**Anecdote:** He said: Muslim bin al-Walid entered one day upon Al-Fadl bin Yahya, who had received news of a son born to him. He sat for the poets, who praised him, and he rewarded them. He looked into people's needs and fulfilled them. The people dispersed from him, and he sat for drink. Muslim was not present for that; he only heard when the assembly ended. He was brought in and asked permission to recite. He permitted him, so he recited about him:\n'The riding camels came guided by a mount... upon which is a youth like a blade comforted by a blade.'\nUntil he reached in it his saying:\n'I came to the tent of Al-Fadl hoping for his favor... for the lot of great praise is great reward.\nA youth whose cloud of generosity hopes graze upon... when their pasture was wishes and procrastination.\nHis right hand drops dew (generosity), and his left... death, and the essence of speech is his decisive word.\nHe pressed upon the days with the loops of their calamities... on a path he found his father on before.\nYahya and Khalid elevated highness with him... so there is no like to him nor like to them.\nBranches that hit a firm planting place... and a root, so they were good where the origin directed them.\nBy the hand of Abu al-Abbas wealth is rained down... favors are brought down, and decisiveness is made to flow.'\nHe said: Al-Fadl was extremely delighted. He ordered the verses to be counted. They were counted and were eighty. He ordered eighty thousand dirhams for him and said: \"Were it not that this is the most a poet has been gifted, I would have increased for you, but it is a limit that cannot be exceeded,\" meaning what Al-Rashid prescribed for Marwan bin Abi Hafsa. He ordered him to sit with him and stay for his companionship, so he stayed with him.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani mentioned with a chain of transmission that Amr bin Bana said: I rode one day to the house of Salih bin al-Rashid and passed by Muhammad bin Ja'far bin Musa al-Hadi. He was addicted to morning draughts, but I found him that day free of it. I asked him the reason for his suspension. He said: \"Niran is angry with me\"—meaning a slave girl belonging to some slave traders in Baghdad. She was one of the excellent ones, of outstanding beauty and witty tongue. He had loved her excessively until he became known for it. I said to him: \"So what would you like?\" He said: \"That you make your way to her master, for he will bring her out to you. If he does, give her this note of mine.\" He gave me a note containing:\n'You wasted the covenant of a youth keeping your covenant... in his keeping is wonder and in your wasting.\nYou distanced from him so he has no device... except waiting for the time of your return.\nHumbled, shedding his tears for you... in sorrow, wondering at the freezing of your tears.\nThat you let him slip and go with his heart... is by the beauty of your face, not the beauty of your deed.'\nI said to him: \"Yes, I will carry this message, and honor to me is what is in it, preserving your soul for you, for I am not safe from this matter continuing with you.\" I took the note and made my way to the slave trader's house. He sent for the girl to come out. She came out. I gave her the note and told her my news. She laughed and returned to the place she came out from. She sat for a brief sitting, then behold, she came to me with a note containing:\n'You continue to exclude me and incite enemies against me... and abandon me until I became practiced in abandonment.\nYou cut my means and forget my affection... so how do you see, O my owner, my patience in love?\nI have become not knowing: is it despair making me patient... over abandonment? Or do I find patience? I do not know.'",

    "text": "He said: I took the note from her and delivered it to him. I went to my house and composed a melody for Muhammad bin Ja'far's verses and a melody for her poetry. Then I went to Prince Salih bin al-Rashid and informed him of what happened to me and sang him the two songs. He ordered his beast to be saddled. It was saddled, and he rode, and I rode with him to the slave trader—Niran's master. We did not leave until he bought her from him for three thousand dinars and carried her to Muhammad bin Ja'far's house, gifting her to him. We stayed a day with him.\n\n**Anecdote:** Judge Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad narrated: I have not seen a man to whom death was presented and he did not care about it, nor \"did it distract him from what he wanted until he achieved it and Allah saved him from killing\" except Tamim bin Jamil al-Sadusi the Kharijite. He had rebelled against Al-Mu'tasim. I saw him brought as a prisoner and entered upon him on the day of the procession. Al-Mu'tasim sat for the people in a public assembly and called for the sword and the leather mat. When he stood before him, Al-Mu'tasim looked at him; his beauty, stature, and his walking to death without caring about it pleased him. He thought about him for a long time, then asked him to speak to see where his mind and tongue stood in relation to his beauty. He said: \"O Tamim, if you have an excuse, bring it.\" He said: \"As for now, if the Commander of the Faithful permits speech, I say: Praise be to Allah who perfected everything He created and began the creation of man from clay, then made his progeny from a quintessence of despised fluid. O Commander of the Faithful, may Allah mend through you the fracture of religion, gather through you the disarray of Islam and Muslims, extinguish through you the meteor of falsehood, and illuminate through you the path of truth. Sins, O Commander of the Faithful, silence tongues and crack hearts. By Allah, the crime is great, the argument is cut off, and suspicion is bad. Nothing remains but your pardon or your vengeance. You are closer to pardon, and it is more like you and more fitting.\" Then he recited to him:\n'I see death between the sword and the mat lurking... watching me wherever I turn.\nMy greatest thought is that you are my killer today... and what man escapes from what Allah has decreed?\nWhat man presents an excuse and argument... while the sword of death is drawn between his eyes?\nIt is hard on Aws bin Tha'lab a position... where the sword is drawn on me and I am silent.\nMy panic is not that I die, for I... know that death is a timed thing.\nBut behind me are children I left... their livers crumbling from sorrow.\nAs if I see them when I am announced dead to them... slapping the heat of cheeks and wailing.\nIf I live, they live safe with envy... I drive destruction away from them, and if I die, they die.\nHow many a speaker: May Allah not make his house far... and another joyful, happy and gloating.'\nHe said: Al-Mu'tasim wept and said: \"Indeed, from eloquence is magic,\" as the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said. Then he said: \"O Tamim, by Allah, the sword almost preceded the blame. I have gifted you to Allah and to your children and forgave your slip.\" Then he contracted a governorship for him over his work, gave him robes, and gave him fifty thousand dinars.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said a Bedouin stood at the door of Dawud bin al-Muhallab for a year without being permitted entry. When permission was given to the people generally, he entered among them. Needs of people were fulfilled according to their classes, and he remained. Dawud raised his head and said: \"Do you have a need, O Bedouin?\" He said: \"Yes, may Allah amend the Emir. I came to you praising with verses of poetry, hoping for a thousand dirhams for every verse.\" Dawud said to him: \"Gently.\" Then he entered his house, girded his sword, and came out. He said: \"Speak. If you do well, we will let you judge (your reward), and if you do not do well, we will deprive you.\" He began:\n'I felt safe through Dawud and the generosity of his right hand... from the feared event, misery, and poverty.\nI felt safe, so I fear no calamity with Dawud... nor misfortune, since I strengthened my back with him.\nTalha al-Talhat did not equal him in generosity... nor Hatim al-Tai nor Khalid al-Qasri.\nHe has the wisdom of Luqman, the form of Joseph... the kingdom of Solomon, and the truthfulness of Abu Dharr.\nA youth from whose generous palm wealth flees... as Satan flees from the Night of Decree.\nHe has ambitions with no end to their greatest... and his smallest ambition is greater than time.\nHis palm, if a tenth of a tenth of it... were on the land, the land would be dewier than the sea.'\nDawud said to him: \"You have done well, O Bedouin. We have made you the judge. Which is more beloved to you: that I give you according to your worth, or according to my worth, or according to the worth of the poetry?\" He said: \"Rather, according to the worth of the poetry.\" He ordered a thousand dirhams for every verse for him, and he left. Some of his sitters said: \"If you had called him back, O Emir, and asked him why he chose according to the worth of the poetry and not according to your worth?\" He ordered him back and asked him about that. He said: \"O Emir, I looked at the world and what is in it, and it does not equal a tenth of a tenth of your worth, so I feared asking you what you cannot bear.\" He said: \"You have done well, by Allah, better than your poetry.\" He doubled the reward for him, and he took it and left.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Al-Utbi from his father said: Zayd bin Munya came from Basra to Muawiyah. He is the brother of Ya'la bin Munya, owner of the Camel (Aisha's camel) and the one in charge of those wars and head of the people of Basra. Ya'la's daughter was married to Utba bin Abi Sufyan. When he entered upon Muawiyah, he complained to him of his debt. He said: \"O Ka'b, give him thirty thousand.\" When he turned away, he said: \"And for the Day of the Camel, thirty thousand more.\" Then he said: \"Join your brother-in-law\"—meaning Utba. He arrived at Utba in Egypt and said: \"I traveled to you for two months wading through perils, wearing the cloaks of night once and wading the depths of mirage another, loaded with good opinion of you, and fleeing from a frowning time and a sticking debt, after wealth with which we cut the noses of enviers.\" Utba said: \"Time lent you wealth and mixed you with us, then retrieved what it could take. There remains for you from us that with which there is no loss. I raise my hand and your hand is in Allah's hand.\" He gave him sixty thousand as Muawiyah gave him.\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Asma'i said: I passed by some Arab tribes, narrating their poetry and gathering their novel news. I left the tribe as if I hadn't entered it. Fate threw me to some clans. I asked the people of the clan for water, but I was not given drink. I left the clan and ended up at a solitary house. I asked its people for water. A girl came out to me with a cup of milk in one hand and a container with water in the other. She said: \"O you, this is water and this is milk, start with whichever you wish. If you want food, it is prepared for you.\" I marveled at her generosity given her people's stinginess and my staying among them. Then I complained to her about her people's stinginess. She said: \"Listen to me,\" then began saying:\n'Take from people what is easy... and leave from people what is difficult.\nFor people are but glass... if you are not gentle with it, it breaks.'\nI left with the two verses, and they were dearer to me than two hundred dinars. Then I saw a high mound with a solitary house on it. I said: \"This house I see is surely one that is noble, and perhaps I will find a scholar in it.\" I headed for it. When I approached, there was a man standing at the door. When he saw me, he entered the house. I entered after him. He went out from the side of the house, and I went out after him. I followed him; he looked at me, stopped, wept loudly, and recited:\n'I paused a pause of doubt, then certainty continued with me... that death is better than poverty.\nAnd one saying she fears death for me... while death is better than life in hardship.\nI will pour out wealth or die in a town... where the flow of tears on my grave is little.'\nI said: \"This is the speech of a writer and the poetry of a wise man. Increase me from your speech, may Allah increase you in every good.\" He said:\n'I was granted a mind but not granted its manliness... and manliness is nothing but abundance of wealth.\nIf I want an elevation, the thinness of my condition... holds me back from making my name famous.'\nI said to him: \"O you, I am the Caliph's companion. Perhaps I can cultivate good for you with him. Increase me from your speech and good composition.\" He began saying:\n'Whoever sows good harvests what pleases him... and the sower of evil is upside down on the head.\nIndeed those whose flow of giving was hoped for... have become in a grave in the belly of dust.'\nI brought his words to Al-Rashid. He admired them and gave me a thousand dinars, ordering me to return before visiting my family. He said: \"Give them to the man, and if you do not meet him, give the money to the closest people to him.\" I came to the tribe and headed for the house. The house had been dismantled. I asked about him. It was said he was called and answered (died). I asked about the closest people to him. I was told: \"The owner of this solitary house.\" I came to it, and it was my companion who gave me water. I asked her about her brother. She said: \"O you, by Allah, he used to bear debts, build nobilities, and repel calamities. His people surrendered him to misfortunes and left him to calamities, so he perished, by Allah, wasted, and left no luggage.\" I said to her: \"O you, I have a thousand dinars the Commander of the Faithful gifted you.\" She said: \"May Allah connect the Commander of the Faithful with honor and increase his reward in the Abode of Standing.\" Then she said: \"By Allah, we are too noble for a thousand dinars to gather with us, for which we would be accounted and punished.\" Then she said to her servant: \"Bring me the old women of the tribe.\" She brought fifty old women. She divided the money among them and kept nothing of it except what fell to the share of one of them.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said Kuthayyir Azza had a merchant slave who came to Sham with goods to sell. Azza sent a woman asking for clothes. She stood over Kuthayyir's slave not knowing him. She bought her need from him but did not pay the price. He used to go to her demanding payment. One day he recited from his master's sayings:\n'Every debtor paid and fulfilled his creditor... while Azza is a procrastinator making her creditor suffer.'",

One man said: \"The most generous person in our time is Abdullah bin Ja'far bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him.\" Another said: \"Rather, the most generous person today is Araba al-Awsi.\" Another said: \"Rather, it is Qays bin Sa'd bin Ubada.\" They argued and exceeded in dispute, and their noise increased while they were in the courtyard of the Kaaba. A man said to them: \"You have argued much. Why doesn't each of you go to his man and ask him, so we look at what he gives and judge by observation?\"\n\nAbdullah bin Ja'far's champion went to him and found him having placed his foot in the stirrup of his mount intending to go to an estate of his. He said to him: \"O son of the worry of the Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"Say what you wish.\" He said: \"A traveler cut off.\" He took his foot out of the stirrup and said: \"Put your foot and settle on the she-camel, and take what is in the bag, and do not be deceived regarding the sword, for it is one of the swords of Ali bin Abi Talib.\" He came with the she-camel, and in the bag were silk cloaks and four thousand dinars, and the greatest and most majestic was the sword.\n\nQays bin Sa'd bin Ubada's champion went and found him asleep. The maid said: \"He is asleep, what is your need with him?\" He said: \"A traveler cut off.\" She said: \"Your need is easier than waking him up. This is a bag containing seven hundred dinars; there is nothing else in Qays's house today. Take it and go to the camel pens to our master with our sign, take one of his mounts and what suits it, and a slave, and go about your business.\" It is said that when Qays woke up from his sleep, the maid told him what she did, so he freed her.\n\nAraba al-Awsi's champion went to him and found he had left his house intending prayer, leaning on two slaves, having lost his sight. He said: \"O Araba.\" He said: \"Say what you wish.\" He said: \"A traveler cut off.\" He released the two slaves, clapped his right hand over his left, and said: \"Awah! Awah! By Allah, Araba has neither morning nor night, for rights have left him no wealth. But take them\"—meaning the two slaves. He said: \"I was not one to clip your wings of them.\" He said: \"If you do not take them, they are free. If you wish, take them; if you wish, free them.\" He proceeded touching the wall with his hand returning to his house. He said: So he took them and brought them.\n\nIt was said they were the most generous people of their time, except they ruled for Araba because he gave his utmost effort.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abdullah bin al-Mu'tamir al-Qaysi said: I performed Hajj one year to the Sacred House of Allah. When I finished my Hajj, I returned to visit the grave of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. While I was sitting one night between the Grave and the Rawdah, I heard loud moaning and apparent yearning. I listened to it, and he was saying:\n'Did the cooing of the Sidr doves sadden you... and stir up the anxieties of the chest in you?\nOr did the memory of a beauty prevent your sleep... gifting you the whispers of remembrance?\nIn a night where the empty-hearted slept... and you were alone with sorrows and thoughts.\nO night that grew long on a sick man... complaining of separation and lack of patience.\nYou surrendered one who loves to the heat of passion... burning like the burning of ember.\nThe moon testifies that I am infatuated... fond of the love of one resembling the moon.\nI did not think I would be saddened by her... until I was afflicted and I did not know.'\nHe said: Then the voice stopped, and I did not know where it came from. I remained bewildered for an hour. Suddenly he returned to weeping and yearning and recited:\n'Did a visitor from Rayya's phantom sadden you... while the night has black locks, dark?\nAnd love visited your soul with its fervor... and early sleep agitated your eye.\nI called Layla while the darkness was like... a sea in which a crashing wave crashes.\nAnd the moon travels in the sky as if... a king departed and the stars are soldiers.\nIf the Pleiades appear, you think them... a cup with wine bubbles circling.\nYou see Gemini dancing in the dark... the dance of a beloved overcome by visible drunkenness.\nO night, you have been long on a lover who has no... helper and supporter but the morning.\nSo it answered me: Die a natural death and know... that love is present humiliation.'",

    "text": "He said: I stood up when he began the verses, heading for the voice. He did not finish the last of them until I was with him. I saw a youth whose facial hair had not yet sprouted, and tears had cut two paths in his cheeks. I said: \"Blessed be the darkness.\" He said: \"And you, blessed be the darkness. Who is the man?\" I said: \"Abdullah bin al-Mu'tamir al-Qaysi.\" He said: \"Do you have a need, O youth?\" I said: \"I was sitting in the Rawdah, and nothing startled me this night except your voice. May I protect you with myself, ransom you with my soul, and console you with my money. What do you suffer?\" He said: \"If it must be, then sit.\" I sat. He said: \"I am Uyayna bin al-Hubab bin al-Mundhir bin al-Jamuh al-Ansari. I went early to the Mosque of Al-Ahzab and remained prostrating and bowing. Then I moved away not far. Suddenly, women swaying like sandgrouse appeared, and in their midst was a girl of marvelous beauty in her age, perfect loveliness in her time. Her light shone, and her scent wafted. She stopped by me and said: 'O Uyayna, what do you say about the union of one who seeks your union?' Then she left me and went. I heard no news of her, nor followed a trace of her. I am bewildered moving from place to place.\" Then he screamed a great scream and fell to the ground unconscious. He recovered after an hour, his face looking as if dyed with saffron, and recited:\n'I see you with my heart from distant lands... You see me seeing you with hearts from afar.\nMy heart and eye are sorry for you... My soul is with you and your memory is with me.\nI do not enjoy life until I see you... Even if I were in Paradise or the Garden of Eternity.'\nHe said: I said to him: \"O brother, repent to your Lord, and ask forgiveness for your sin, for before you is the terror of the Rising and the evil of the resting place.\" He said: \"Far from it! Far from it! I will not be consoled until the two gatherers of acacia leaves return (i.e., never).\" I stayed with him until dawn broke. I said to him: \"Come with us to the Mosque of Al-Ahzab, perhaps Allah will relieve your distress.\" He said: \"I hope for that through the blessing of your countenance, God willing.\" We walked until we reached the Mosque of Al-Ahzab. I heard him say:\n'O men, regarding Wednesday... Will it not cease causing delight for me after prohibition?\nA gazelle never ceases to wrong me in it... falling to the Mosque of Al-Ahzab veiled.\nTelling people that reward is his intent... while he came not seeking reward nor calculating.\nIf he sought reward, he would not have come at noon... smeared with crushed musk, dyed.'\nWe sat until we prayed Dhuhr. Suddenly the women approached, but the girl was not among them. They said: \"O Uyayna, what do you think of one seeking your union while your mind is eclipsed?\" He said: \"What is wrong with her?\" They said: \"Her father took her and moved to Samawa.\" I asked them about the girl. They said: \"She is Rayya, daughter of Al-Ghatrif al-Sulami.\" He raised his head to them and recited:\n'My friends, Rayya has hastened her early departure... and her caravan traveled to the land of Samawa.\nMy friends, whatever Umm Malik decrees... upon me, no emir can transgress against me.\nMy friends, I have become blind from weeping... Is there with anyone else an eye I can borrow?'",

    "text": "He said: I said, \"O Uyayna, I came to Hijaz with abundant wealth, curious gifts, fabrics, and goods, intending them for people of covering (virtue). By Allah, I will spend it before you until I give you satisfaction and above satisfaction. Come with us to the assembly of the Ansar.\" We stood up until we overlooked a gathering of them. I greeted, and they returned the greeting well. Then I said: \"O gathering, what do you say about Uyayna and his father?\" They said: \"Good and son of good, from the masters of the Arabs.\" I said: \"He has been struck by a calamity of love, and the fever of passion has settled in his heart. I want nothing from you but assistance to Samawa.\" They said: \"Hearing and obedience.\" We rode, and the people rode with us until we overlooked the dwellings of Banu Sulaym in the regions of Khaffan in Samawa. We said: \"Where is the house of the Master Al-Ghatrif?\" They said: \"Before you.\" We traveled, and Al-Ghatrif was informed of us. He came out rushing and met us saying: \"Greeted with honor, and gifted with the best livestock.\" We said: \"And you are greeted and gifted. We are your guests.\" He said: \"You have landed in the best dwelling and settled in the most generous stronghold.\" Then he said: \"O slaves, settle the people.\" Leather mats, cushions, and carpets were spread for us, and we settled. Then sacrifices were slaughtered and camels butchered. We said: \"O master of the people, we will not taste your food until you fulfill our need and send us back with our joy.\" He said: \"What is your need?\" We said: \"We propose for your noble daughter to Uyayna bin al-Hubab bin al-Mundhir, of good element and current pride.\" He said: \"O brothers, the one you propose to, her affair is up to herself. Here I am entering to inform her.\" Then he rose angrily and entered upon Rayya—she was true to her name (fragrance). She said: \"O father, why do I see anger apparent on you?\" He said to her: \"The Ansar arrived proposing for you from me.\" She said: \"Noble masters, great heroes, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, asked forgiveness for them. Who is the proposal for among them?\" He said: \"For a youth known as Uyayna al-Hubab.\" She said: \"By Allah, I have heard about this Uyayna; he fulfills what he promises, achieves if he intends, eats what he finds, and does not ask about what he lacks.\" He said: \"I swear I will never marry you to him, for some talk of your conversation with him has reached me.\" She said: \"That was not so. But if you have sworn, the Ansar are not to be rejected with an ugly rejection. Give them a good rejection.\" He said: \"With what?\" She said: \"Be harsh with them regarding the dowry, for they will return and not agree.\" He said: \"How excellent is what you said.\" Then he went out rushing and said: \"The girl of the tribe has agreed, but I want a dowry like hers. Who will undertake it?\" Abdullah bin al-Mu'tamir said: \"I will. Say what you wish.\" He said: \"I want one thousand mithqals of red gold.\" He said: \"You have that.\" He said: \"I want five thousand dirhams of Hajar mint.\" He said: \"You have that.\" He said: \"I want one hundred garments of striped cloaks and ink-colored cloth.\" He said: \"You have that.\" He said: \"I want twenty garments of embroidered silk.\" He said: \"You have that.\" He said: \"I want a pearl necklace.\" He said: \"You have that.\" He said: \"I want five stomachs of ambergris.\" He said: \"You have that.\" He said: \"I want twenty pods of pungent musk.\" He said: \"You have that. Have I answered?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: Abdullah bin al-Mu'tamir sent a group of Ansar to Medina, and they brought all he guaranteed. Sheep and camels were slaughtered, and people gathered to eat food. He said: We stayed forty days in this state. Then he said: \"Take your girl and depart accompanied.\" Then he carried her in a howdah and equipped her with thirty camels carrying many gifts and curiosities. He bid us farewell, and we traveled. When one stage remained between us and Medina, horsemen came out against us intending a raid; I think they were Banu Sulaym. Uyayna bin al-Hubab charged them and killed several men. He turned back towards us with a stab wound gushing blood. Then he fell to the ground. Help came to us from the inhabitants of the land, and they drove away the horses. Uyayna had passed away. We said: \"O Uyayna!\" The girl heard us and threw herself upon him. She began kissing him and shouting with burning grief, saying:\n'I forced patience, not that I was patient, but... I distract my soul that it will join you.\nIf my soul were fair, it would have been to death... before you, ahead of creation, preceding.\nNo one after me and you is fair... to a friend, nor is a soul truthful to a soul.'\nThen she gasped one gasp and died. We dug one grave for them and buried them in it. I returned to the dwellings of my people and stayed seven years. Then I returned to Hijaz and came to visit. I said: \"By Allah, I will return to Uyayna's grave to visit him.\" I came to the grave and found a tree growing on it with red, yellow, and green ribbons. I said to the owners of the house: \"What is this tree called?\" They said: \"The Tree of the Two Bridegrooms.\" I stayed at the grave a day and a night, then left. That was the last contact with it. Peace.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Ali al-Madharai narrated in Egypt: I was riding with Abu al-Jaysh Khumarawayh bin Ahmad bin Tulun in Damascus. We went out hunting and took the route of the Thawra river. While we were traveling, a Bedouin met him, took the rein of his horse, and recited:\n'If the spearhead and the sword edge could speak... they would tell people wonders about you.\nYou exhausted your wealth giving and looting it... O bane of white silver and gold.'\nAbu al-Jaysh said: \"O boy, give him what is in the pouch.\" There were five hundred dinars in it. He said: \"O Emir, increase me.\" Abu al-Jaysh said to the slaves present: \"Throw your swords and belts on him.\" Seventeen slaves rushed and threw their belts and swords. He said: \"O Emir, transport me.\" He ordered a mule from the procession's mules to be given to him, and he carried that with him. We returned from the hunt. I had not yet settled in my seat when Abu al-Jaysh Khumarawayh's signature came to me: \"Advance, may Allah give me enjoyment of you, with the crafting of seventeen swords and seventeen belts of good gold for the slaves in place of what they gave, so that those slaves who delayed regret what they missed of that.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Fadl bin Yahya rode one day from his house in Al-Khuld intending his house at Bab al-Shamasiya. A young man from the Abna (Persian settlers) who was getting married met him, accompanied by a group of people carrying his wedding items. When he saw Al-Fadl, he dismounted and kissed his hand, though he did not know him. Al-Fadl asked him about the dowry and learned it was four thousand dirhams. He ordered four thousand dirhams for him as his wife's dowry, four thousand dirhams as the price of a house to live in, four thousand dirhams for the cost of his banquet, and four thousand dirhams to help him with the contract he made upon himself. He left.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that Muhammad bin Ibrahim the Imam fell into debt. He rode to Al-Fadl bin Yahya with a box containing jewels. He said to him: \"Our yields have fallen short, our Caliph has neglected our affair, and our expenses have increased. A debt has become obligatory upon us to pay, which is one million dirhams. I hated exposing my face to merchants and degrading my honor among them. You have people among them who will give you what you want, and I have a pledge that suffices for that. If you see fit to order some of them to take it and carry the money to us, do so.\" Al-Fadl called for the box, saw what was in it, sealed it with Muhammad bin Ibrahim's ring, and said to him: \"The need succeeds if you stay with me today.\" He said to him: \"Staying is difficult for me.\" He said to him: \"What is difficult for you in that? If you see fit to wear some of our clothes 'I called for it', otherwise I ordered clothes brought from your house.\" He stayed. Al-Fadl stood up, called his agent, and ordered him to carry the money and hand it to Muhammad bin Ibrahim's servant, and hand the box with the jewels with his seal to him, and take his receipt for that. The agent did that. Muhammad stayed with him until sunset, having no news. Then he went to his house, saw the money, and the servant brought the box. He went early to Al-Fadl to thank him but found he had preceded him in riding to Al-Rashid's house. He stood waiting for him at Al-Rashid's door. He was told he had left from the other door. He followed him and found he had entered to his son. He stood waiting for him. He was told: \"He left from the other door heading to his house.\" So he turned away from him. When he reached his house, Al-Fadl sent him another one million dirhams. He went early to him, thanked him, and prolonged it. Al-Fadl informed him that he spent a night long with grief over what he complained of, until he met Al-Rashid and informed him of his condition. He ordered him to estimate for him. He continued to negotiate with him until the situation was settled at one million dirhams. He said: \"He has never given you the like of it, nor exceeded twenty thousand dinars. I thanked him and asked him to send you a check for it in his handwriting and make me the messenger, so he did.\" Muhammad thanked him and said: \"The Commander of the Faithful told the truth; he never connected me with more than twenty thousand dinars. This was only made possible by you and at your hands. I cannot fulfill your right nor offer thanks to repay your favor, except that upon me is a vow\"—and he swore confirmed oaths—\"that I will not stand at anyone's door but yours, nor ask anyone else a need ever, even if I lick the soil.\" He used not to ride to anyone but Al-Fadl until what happened to them happened. After that, he used not to ride to anyone but Al-Rashid and return to his house. He was blamed after their days ended for leaving visiting Al-Fadl bin al-Rabi'. He said: \"By Allah, if I lived a thousand years and sucked water from rocky ground, I would not stand at anyone's door after Al-Fadl bin Yahya, nor ask him a need ever until I meet Allah Almighty.\" This remained his state until he died.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "It is said that when Al-Rashid performed Hajj and returned, he stopped at Al-Anbar. He summoned Salih, the owner of the prayer-mat, when he turned against the Barmakids. He said to him: \"Go out to Mansur bin Ziyad and tell him: Ten million dirhams have been validated against you, so bring them to me this very day. If he pays them to you complete before the sun sets this day, fine; otherwise, bring me his head. Beware of reviewing me regarding anything of his affair.\" Salih said: I went out to Mansur while he was in the house and informed him of the news. He said: \"We belong to Allah and to Him we return. By Allah, my life is gone.\" Then he swore he did not know the location of three hundred thousand dirhams, let alone ten million. Salih said to him: \"Start your work.\" He said to him: \"Go with us to my house so I can make a will and settle my affairs.\" We went. No sooner had he entered than screaming rose from his homes and women's chambers. He made his will and came out bloodless. Salih said: \"Let us go until we come to Yahya bin Khalid; perhaps Allah will bring us relief from his direction.\" He went with him and entered upon Yahya weeping. Yahya said to him: \"What is behind you?\" He told him the story. Yahya became anxious for his sake and looked down thinking. Then he called his treasurer and said to him: \"How much money do you have?\" He said: \"Five million dirhams.\" He said: \"Bring me its keys.\" He brought them. Then he sent to his son Al-Fadl: \"You had informed me, may your father be your ransom, that you have two million dirhams and I wished you would buy an estate with them. I have found an estate for you whose remembrance and gratitude will remain, and whose fruit will be praised. Send the money to us.\" He sent it. Then he said to the messenger: \"Go to Ja'far and say to him: Send me, may your father be your ransom, one million dirhams for a right incumbent upon me.\" He sent it to him. Salih said: \"This is eight million dirhams.\" Then he prolonged his looking down because nothing remained with him. Then he raised his head to a servant of his and said: \"Go to Dananir and tell her: Send me the necklace the Commander of the Faithful gave you.\" He brought it. It was a huge necklace like the thickness of an arm. He said to Salih: \"I bought this for Al-Rashid for one hundred and twenty thousand dinars. The Caliph gave it to Dananir. We have calculated it against you for two million dirhams (note: text says 2000, context implies 2 million to reach 10 million). This is the complete amount. Leave and let our friend go; you have no way against him.\" Salih said: I took that and returned Mansur with me. When we were at the door, he recited proverbially:\n'You two left me while nothing remained of me... but you feared the penetrating arrows.'\nSalih said: \"There is no man on the whole earth more generous than the man we left, nor have I heard of the like of him in the past, nor will there be the like of him among those remaining. And there is no man on the face of the earth with a more malicious secret or worse nature than this Nabataean, since he did not thank the one who gave him life.\" He said: Then I went to Al-Rashid and told him the story of the money, and withheld from him what Mansur said because I feared if he heard it he would order his killing. Al-Rashid said: \"As for me, I knew that if he was saved, he would only be saved by the people of this house.\" He said: \"Take the money and return the necklace to Dananir, for I would not give a gift and have it return to me.\" Salih said: I did not feel good leaving Yahya uninformed of what Mansur said. I said, when I saw him after praising his thanks and describing his deed: \"You bestowed favor on an ungrateful one who met the noblest deed with the vilest speech.\" He said: \"How is that?\" I informed him of what he said and what happened. He began, by Allah, seeking excuses for him and saying: \"O Abu Ali, the terrified heart may let the tongue slip with what is not in the conscience, and the man was in a terrible state.\" I said: \"By Allah, I do not know which of your matters I marvel at more, the beginning or the end, but I know that time will never replace the like of you.\"\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Judge Abu al-Qasim Ali bin al-Muhsin bin Ali al-Tanukhi, author of the book 'Al-Faraj ba'd al-Shiddah' (Relief after Hardship), said in his book: Ali bin Hisham told me: I heard Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Isa speaking, saying: I heard Abdullah bin Sulayman bin Wahb saying: My father told me: I and Abu al-Abbas Ahmad bin al-Khasib, along with a multitude of officials and scribes, were detained in the hands of Muhammad bin Abd al-Malik al-Zayyat at the end of his vizierate for Al-Wathiq. Al-Wathiq's illness intensified, and he was veiled from people for six days. Abu Abdullah Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad, the Chief Judge, may Allah have mercy on him, entered upon him. Al-Wathiq said to him: \"O Abu Abdullah\"—and he used to use his kunya—\"The world and the Hereafter have gone from me. As for the world, you see death present. As for the Hereafter, what I have sent forward of ugly deeds. Do you have any remedy?\" He said: \"Yes, O Commander of the Faithful. Muhammad bin Abd al-Malik has dismissed a group of scribes and deceived you regarding them. He filled the prisons with them and did not obtain much from them. They are a large multitude behind whom are a thousand hands raised to Allah against you. Order their release so hands may be raised in supplication for you. Perhaps Allah Almighty will grant you health, for in this state you need to lessen your adversaries.\" He said: \"Yes, what you advised. Sign on my behalf for their release.\" He said: \"If he sees my handwriting, he will resist and persist. But let the Commander of the Faithful seize the reward, force himself, sit up, and sign for them in his own hand.\" Al-Wathiq did that and signed with a shaky hand to Ibn al-Zayyat for their release, and the release of everyone in the prisons without consultation or review. He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, order the Chamberlain Itakh to go with the signature to him, and not let him do anything or release them (on his own terms), and to prevent him from reaching you or writing a note or occupying himself with anything at all except after releasing them. If he meets him riding on the road, let him make him dismount and sit until he finishes your command.\" Al-Wathiq ordered Itakh to comply with that. He headed out and met Ibn al-Zayyat riding, intending the Caliph. He said to him: \"Dismount your beast and sit on your saddle cover.\" He was terrified and thought the calamity had befallen him. He dismounted and sat on his saddle cover. He showed him the signature. He refused and said: \"If I release these people, from where will I spend money and establish supplies?\" He said: \"It must be done.\" He said: \"Ride and ask his permission.\" He said: \"There is no way to what you mentioned.\" He said: \"Then let me write.\" He said: \"Nor this.\" He did not let him leave his place until he signed for the release of the people to the last of them.\n\nThe Chamberlain came to us while we were in prison, most despairing of relief. We had heard of the intensification of Al-Wathiq's illness, and rumors spread about the Caliphate for his son, who was a boy. We feared that if that happened, Ibn al-Zayyat would become the boy's sheikh, take over the administration, and destroy us. We had refrained from food and drink out of excessive grief. When Itakh entered the prison, we had no doubt he came only for a calamity. He said: \"Good news of release,\" and informed us of the situation. We were released. We praised Allah Almighty, prayed for Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad and the Caliph, and left for our homes. We stayed a moment then went out and stood for Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad on his way, waiting for his return from the Caliph's house. When we saw him, we dismounted, prayed for him, and thanked him. He denied that, considered it great, and forbade us from dismounting, but we did not refrain. He stopped until we rode and walked with him. He began telling us the news while we thanked him, and he belittled what he did, saying: \"This is the least of your rights, and you will know what I will do in the future.\" He returned to the Caliph's house in the evening. Al-Wathiq said to him: \"I was blessed by your opinion, O Abu Abdullah, and found lightness from the illness. I became active and ate the weight of five dirhams of bread with a francolin breast.\" He said to him: \"O Commander of the Faithful, those hands that were praying against you in the morning have become praying for you in the evening. A large number of your subjects pray for you because of them. However, they have returned to ruined houses and ugly conditions, without furnishings, clothes, or beasts, dead from hunger and emaciation.\" He said: \"So what do you think?\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, complete Allah's blessing upon you and perfect your blessing upon these people by what you do with them.\" He said: \"What is that?\" He said: \"In the treasuries and stables are remnants of what was taken from them. If you order that to be looked into, so everyone for whom something remaining is found, it is returned to him, and their estates are released for them to live by, the sin will be lightened, supplication doubled, and health strengthened.\" He said: \"Sign on my behalf for that.\" So he signed for it. We felt nothing until our blessings returned to us. Al-Wathiq died after three or four days. Allah brought us relief through Ibn Abi Du'ad, and this noble deed remained for him on our necks.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

I had taught and refined her, and I estimated in her what would make me rich. When we neared Damascus, the caravan stopped at a water pond, and I stopped aside from them. I ate some food I had and brought out a small water skin containing leftover nabidh I had, so I drank. While I was in that state, a young man of handsome face and appearance appeared on a blond horse, accompanied by two servants. He wore gilded brocade clothes. I didn't know whether his face was more beautiful, or his clothes, or his beast. He greeted me and said: \"Do you accept a guest?\" I stood up, held his stirrup, and realized he was from the Caliphate family. Awe and reverence for him entered me. I said: \"Dismount, O my master.\" He dismounted and said: \"Give us drink from your drink.\" I gave him drink. He said: \"If it is easy for you to sing me a song, do so.\" I sang to him:\n'I wonder, is this the beginning of confusion... or a time of sedition other than confusion?'\nHe was delighted and asked for it again. Then he said: \"Tell your slave girl to sing us a song.\" She sang my melody to Ibn Harma's poetry:\n'O Fatim, does distance console those of passion... or does my distance increase my ecstasy for you?'",

    "text": "He was delighted, drank, and asked for it repeated many times until I prayed the final evening prayer. He said to me: 'What brought you to us in this city?' I said: 'I wanted to sell this slave girl of mine.' He said: 'And how much did you estimate for her price?' I said: 'Whatever pays my debt and fixes my condition.' He said: 'Does thirty thousand satisfy you?' I said: 'How needy I am for Allah's bounty and increase from Him.' He said: 'Does forty thousand satisfy you?' I said: 'It would pay my debt and leave me bare and empty.' He said: 'I have taken her for fifty thousand dirhams, and you will have after that a reward, clothes, and expenses for your journey, and I will share my state with you forever as long as I live.' I said: 'I have sold her to you.' He said: 'I have accepted. Do you trust me to carry that to you tomorrow and carry her with me, or shall she stay with you?' Intoxication, awe of him, and shyness drove me to say: 'Yes, I trust you, so take her, may Allah bless her for you.' He said to one of his servants: 'Carry her on your beast and ride behind her and go with her.' He rode his horse and bid me farewell. No sooner had he disappeared from me than I realized the place of my error and mistake. I said: 'What have I done to myself and committed against it? I handed over a slave girl to a man I do not know, nor do I know what he is, nor his name or lineage, nor from which land he is. Even if I knew him, how would I reach him?' I sat thinking until morning. I prayed and sat in my place. My companions departed and entered Damascus. The sun melted me. I hesitated between staying and entering. I said: 'If I enter, I am not safe from the man's messenger coming to seek me and not finding me or knowing my location, and I would have committed a second crime against myself.' So I stayed, sent my luggage with some people from Medina, and sat in the shade of a wall there. When the day was high, one of the two servants who were with the man yesterday approached me. I do not remember being happy with anything as I was with seeing him. He said to me: 'I have been going around looking for you in your caravan since morning.' Before I asked him anything, I said: 'Who is my companion?' He said: 'The Crown Prince Al-Walid bin Yazid.' My soul calmed. Then he said: 'Stand up and ride.' He had a beast with him. I rode and entered upon him. The slave girl had been given a separate room and she was in it. He brought me into her. When she saw me, she jumped and greeted me. I said: 'What happened to you?' She said: 'He entered his house, I was settled here and checked upon for what I needed, and I am as you see in travel clothes.' I sat with her. Suddenly the servant came and said: 'Stand up.' I stood up, and he brought me into my companion of yesterday. He was sitting on his bed. He said: 'Who are you?' I said: 'Yunus al-Katib.' He said: 'Welcome to you. By Allah, I was longing for you, and I used to hear about you. How was your night?' I said: 'Good, may Allah honor the Emir.' He said: 'Did you regret what you did last night, saying \"I gave my slave girl to a man I do not know\"?' I said: 'O Emir, God forbid I regret, even if I gifted her to the Emir. What is the value of this slave girl?' He said: 'But I regretted taking her from you, saying: \"A stranger who does not know me, and I distressed him tonight, and I was foolish in my haste to take her.\" Do you remember what passed between us yesterday?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Did you sell me the slave girl for fifty thousand dirhams?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Bring the money, O boy.' The slaves brought it carrying it and placed it before him. He said: 'Bring, O boy, a thousand dinars separately.' A bag was brought and placed. Then he said: 'Bring another five hundred dinars.' It was brought and placed as well. Then he said: 'This is the money for your slave girl, take it. And this is a thousand dinars for your good opinion of us. And this is five hundred dinars for your travel expenses and what you buy for your family. Are you satisfied?' I kissed his hand and foot and said: 'By Allah, you have filled my eye and hand.' He said: 'O boy, present to him a beast with its saddle and bridle to ride, and a mule for his luggage.' Then he said: 'If you hear that this affair (Caliphate) has passed to me, visit me. By Allah, I will fill your hands and enrich you as long as I remain.' I left and headed to my country. When the Caliphate passed to him, I went to him, and by Allah, he fulfilled his promise and increased. I was with him in the easiest condition and highest status. My conditions expanded, and I acquired estates and properties from which I live until now, and those after me. I remained with him until he was killed.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "It is said that Al-Afshin hated Abu Dulaf al-Qasim bin Isa al-Ijli and envied him for his virtue. One day he resolved to kill him and summoned him with urgency and disturbance. Abu Dulaf was a friend of the Chief Judge Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad. He sent to him: 'Save me, for my situation is such and such.' He rode quickly and summoned the witnesses present with him. When he arrived at Al-Afshin's door, the slaves said to him: 'We will ask permission for you.' He said: 'The matter is more urgent than that.' He dismounted and entered. He found Al-Afshin sitting in his place, and Abu Dulaf had been made to stand before him in the courtyard. When Al-Afshin saw the Chief Judge enter without permission, he was dumbfounded. Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad said to him: 'O Emir, I am the messenger of the Commander of the Faithful to you, ordering you not to do anything regarding Al-Qasim without his permission.' Then he turned to the witnesses and said: 'Bear witness that I have conveyed the message of the Commander of the Faithful, and that Al-Qasim is alive and healthy.' Then he left and came to Al-Mu'tasim's door quickly. He asked permission to see him and was permitted. When he entered upon him, he said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, I have told a lie on your behalf hoping for Paradise by it, and for you, pride in it.' He said: 'What is it?' He said: 'The matter was such and such.' Al-Mu'tasim laughed and said: 'You did well, may Allah do well to you.' Before long, Al-Afshin came asking permission. He was permitted. When he settled in his seat, he said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, a message came to me from you with the Chief Judge regarding Abu Dulaf, so what do you command regarding him?' He said: 'Yes, I sent to you regarding him, so beware of touching him except with good.' Thus he escaped his hand.\n\n**Anecdote:** Judge Abu al-Qasim Ali bin al-Muhsin bin Ali al-Tanukhi narrated in the book \"Al-Faraj ba'd al-Shiddah\": Abu al-Faraj Ali bin al-Husayn al-Isfahani told me: Muhammad bin Zayd the Alawite, the Da'i (Caller) in Tabaristan, used to check the land tax treasury when he opened the tax collection. He would distribute the tax of the previous year among the tribes of Quraysh according to their stipends, and among the Ansar, the jurists, the Quran readers, and other classes of people, until he distributed all that remained. One year, he sat distributing the like as was his habit. When he started with Banu Abd Manaf, having finished with Banu Hashim, he called the rest of Banu Abd Manaf. A man stood up to him. He said: 'From which Banu Abd Manaf are you?' He said: 'From Banu Umayya.' He said: 'From which of them are you?' He remained silent. He said: 'Perhaps you are from the descendants of Muawiyah?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Are you from any of them?' He remained silent. He said: 'Perhaps you are from the descendants of Yazid?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Wretched is the choice you made for yourself. Do you seek a land ruled by the family of Abu Talib while you have their blood revenge regarding their master (Husayn)? You had an alternative away from them in Sham and Iraq with those who support your grandfather and love your piety. If you came out of ignorance of this, then there is no ignorance after your ignorance. And if you came mocking them, you have risked yourself.' The Alawites looked at him intensely. Muhammad shouted at them and said: 'Stop, may Allah heal you. Do you think that killing this man is an achievement or revenge for the two Hasans bin Ali? What is this man's crime? Allah Almighty has forbidden that a soul be held accountable for other than what it earned. By Allah, no one touches him but I will execute him for it. Listen to a story I will tell you to be an example for you in the future:",

    "text": "My father told me from his father who said: A magnificent jewel was presented to Al-Mansur in a Hajj year. He recognized it and said: \"This belonged to Hisham bin Abd al-Malik. This means news of him has reached me that he is with his son Muhammad, and no one else remains of them.\" Then he said to Al-Rabi': \"When it is tomorrow and I pray with the people in the Sacred Mosque and the people are inside, close the doors, place your trusted Shia men at them and lock them. Open only one door for the people, stand at it, and let no one exit unless you know him.\" When it was tomorrow, Al-Rabi' did that. Muhammad bin Hisham realized the story and knew he was the one sought and that he would be caught, so he became bewildered. Muhammad bin Zayd bin Ali bin al-Husayn bin Ali bin Abi Talib approached after that and saw him bewildered, not knowing him. He denied his state (found it strange) and said to him: \"O you, I see you bewildered and looking around. Who are you? You have the complete general safety of Allah Almighty, and you are in my protection until I save you with the help of Allah Almighty.\" He said: \"I am Muhammad bin Hisham bin Abd al-Malik. Who are you?\" He said: \"I am Muhammad bin Zayd bin Ali bin al-Husayn.\" He said: \"Then I count my soul with Allah (expect death),\" since he said: \"No harm on you, O cousin. You are not the killer of Zayd, nor is obtaining his revenge in killing you. I am now more entitled to save you than to surrender you. However, excuse me for the dislike I will handle you with and the ugly address I will address you with, for in it is your salvation, by the will of Allah Almighty.\" He said: \"O master, it is up to you.\" He threw his cloak over his head and face, grabbed his collar, and began dragging him. When Al-Rabi's eye fell on him, he slapped him several times and brought him to Al-Rabi', saying: \"O Abu al-Fadl, this malicious man is a camel driver from Kufa. He rented me his camel going and returning, and he fled from me at this time and rented it to some Khurasani commanders. I have witnesses against him for that. Assign two guards to me to go with him and me to the judge and prevent the Khurasani from interfering if he interferes with us.\" Al-Rabi' assigned two guards to him and said: \"Go with him.\" After he distanced from the mosque, he said to him: \"O malicious one, will you give me my right?\" He said: \"Yes, O son of the Messenger of Allah.\" He said to the guards: \"Leave in the safety of Allah Almighty.\" They left. When they were far away, he released him. Muhammad bin Hisham kissed his head and said: \"By my father and mother you are, by Allah. Allah knows best where He places His messages.\" Then he brought out a jewel of great value and gave it to him saying: \"Honor me, O master, by accepting this from me.\" He said: \"Go with your goods, O cousin. We, the People of the House, do not accept reward for kindness. I have left the blood of Zayd for you, which is greater in value than your goods. Go guided and hide your person from this man until he leaves, for he is serious in seeking you.\" He left and hid. He said: Then Muhammad bin Zayd, the Da'i in Tabaristan, ordered for the Umayyad the like of what he ordered for the rest of Banu Abd Manaf. He assigned a group of his clients to him and ordered them to take him out to Rayy and bring him a letter of his safety. The Umayyad stood up, kissed his head, went with them until he reached his safe place, and they brought him the letter of his safety.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Qasim bin al-Mu'ammar al-Zuhri said: I was walking with Yahya bin Khalid, and he was between his two sons Al-Fadl and Ja'far. Abu al-Yanbaghi was standing on the road and called out to me: \"O Zuhri!\" I looked up at him. He said:\n\"I accompanied the Barmakids for ten consecutive years... and my house is rented and my bread is purchased.\"\nHe said: Yahya heard him, turned to Al-Fadl and Ja'far, and said: \"Fie on this deed! Is Abu al-Yanbaghi someone to be audited (treated stingily)?\" When it was the next day, Abu al-Yanbaghi came to me. I said: \"Woe to you, what is this you exposed yourself to?\" He said: \"Be silent. No sooner had I returned to my house than a bag of money came to me from Al-Fadl and a bag from Ja'far, and each of them gifted me a house and assigned me sufficient provisions from his kitchen.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that Muhammad bin al-Jahm offered a house of his for sale for fifty thousand dirhams. When the witnesses arrived to witness, he said: \"How much will you buy from me the neighborhood of Sa'id bin al-As?\" The house was in the neighborhood of Sa'id bin al-As. They said: \"Is neighborhood sold?\" He said: \"How can the neighborhood of one who gives if you ask him, initiates if you are silent, and does good if you treat him badly not be sold?\" It is said: This reached Sa'id, so he sent him one hundred thousand dirhams and said to him: \"Keep your house.\"\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi narrated: Ja'far bin Yahya secluded himself one day in his house, and his boon companions attended, and I was among them. He perfumed himself with Khaluq (perfume), wore silk, and did the same to us. He ordered the chamberlain to guard the door (letting no one in) except Abd al-Malik bin Najran, his scribe. The chamberlain heard \"Abd al-Malik\" without \"Ibn Najran\". A part of the day passed. Abd al-Malik bin Salih bin Ali al-Hashimi, the uncle of Al-Rashid, learned of Ja'far's stay in his house and rode to him. When he reached Ja'far's house, the chamberlain sent word that Abd al-Malik had arrived. He said: \"Let him in,\" thinking it was his scribe. Abd al-Malik bin Salih entered trailing his black robes and Rusafi cap, with his majesty, piety, noble status, and etiquette. When Ja'far saw him, his face turned black; the matter was grave and alarmed him. Abd al-Malik did not drink nabidh (wine), and that was the reason for Al-Rashid's anger at him, because he requested his companionship but he refused. Abd al-Malik understood what he saw from Ja'far. He called his servant, handed him his black robes, turban, and sword, and approached until he stood at the door of the sitting room we were in. He greeted and said: \"Include us in your affair; do to us what you did to yourselves.\" A servant approached him, dressed him in silk, and perfumed him with Khaluq. Then he sat and called for food and ate. He called for nabidh; a rotl (large cup) was brought, and he drank it. He said to Ja'far: \"By Allah, I have never drunk it before today, so let it be lightened for me.\" A large pitcher was called for and placed before him. Every time he did something like that, Ja'far's anxiety cleared. When he wanted to leave, Ja'far said to him: \"May Allah make me your ransom. You have been gracious and helpful. Ask your need, for my ability cannot encompass rewarding what came from you today. There is some ill feeling in the Commander of the Faithful's heart against me; ask him to be pleased with me.\" He said: \"The Commander of the Faithful is pleased with you and what he had against you is gone.\" He said: \"I have a debt of four million dirhams to be paid for me.\" He said: \"It is yours from me ready, but I will make it from the Commander of the Faithful's wealth, for it is nobler for you and more beloved to you.\" He said: \"And Ibrahim my son, I wish to strengthen his back by marriage from the descendants of the Caliphate.\" He said: \"The Commander of the Faithful has married him to his daughter Al-Aliyah.\" He said: \"And I wish for a banner to flutter over his head (governorship).\" He said: \"The Commander of the Faithful has appointed him governor of Egypt.\" Abd al-Malik left, and we were amazed at Ja'far's boldness in fulfilling needs without permission, and we said: \"Perhaps his requests for needs will be granted, but what about the marriage? Will he or others be granted authority for that?\" When it was tomorrow, we went early and stood at Al-Rashid's door. Ja'far entered. Before long, Abu Yusuf the Judge, Muhammad bin al-Hasan, and Ibrahim bin Abd al-Malik bin Salih were called. Then Ibrahim came out with banners before him, having been given robes of honor, married to Al-Aliyah daughter of Al-Rashid, and his decree for Egypt written. The bags of money were carried to Abd al-Malik's house. Ja'far came out and signaled us to follow him to his house. When we returned to Ja'far's house, he said: \"Your hearts were attached to the beginning of Abd al-Malik's affair, so you loved to know its end: When I entered upon the Commander of the Faithful and stood before him, I began telling him the story from beginning to end. He kept saying: 'Good, by Allah! Good, by Allah!' until I completed his news and what I granted him. He kept saying in all of that: 'You did well, you did well.' So it was as you saw.\" Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi said: By Allah, I do not know which of them is more generous and amazing in deed: what Abd al-Malik bin Salih initiated of assistance and drinking wine etc., while he was a man of seriousness, chastity, dignity, and reputation; or Ja'far's boldness with Al-Rashid in what he undertook; or Al-Rashid's execution of everything Ja'far judged upon him?\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "It is said that an incident occurred between Ghassan bin Abbad and Ali bin Isa al-Qummi that led to enmity. Ali bin Isa was the guarantor of the land tax and estates in his region. A balance of forty thousand dinars remained against him. Al-Mamun insisted on his paying it and demanded it until he said to Ali bin Salih, his chamberlain: \"Demand from Ali bin Isa what remains against him, and give him three days respite. If he brings the money before they pass, fine; otherwise, flog him with whips until he pays it or perishes.\" Ali bin Isa left Al-Mamun's house despairing of himself, as he knew no way to free himself of the money. His scribe said to him: \"If you turned to Ghassan bin Abbad and informed him of your news, I would hope he might help you in your affair.\" He said to him: \"Despite what is between me and him?\" He said: \"Yes, for the man is noble and generous.\" The condition he was in drove him to accept that from his scribe. They entered upon Ghassan. He stood up for him, received him with acceptance, and fulfilled his due respect. Ali bin Isa said to him: \"The situation between me and you does not mandate what you showed of your generosity.\" He said: \"That is regarding a matter of competition and conflict. As for what is between me and you (personally), leave it as is. Your entering my house has a sanctity that obligates attaining what you hoped for with me. Mention if you have a need.\" His scribe told him the story. He said: \"I hope Allah Almighty suffices him,\" and added nothing to this. Ali bin Isa stood up and left him despairing of his good, regretting his approach to Ghassan given what was between them. He said to his scribe when he left: \"You have benefited me nothing by approaching Ghassan and forcing me to enter upon him except hastening gloating and humiliation. Perhaps he will find through this a way to vent his anger on me.\"\n\nAli bin Isa had not reached his house before Ghassan's scribe arrived with mules carrying the money. He conveyed his greetings and said: \"The money is present, so proceed to hand it over and go early to the Commander of the Faithful's house tomorrow.\" Ali bin Isa went early and found Ghassan had preceded him there and entered upon Al-Mamun standing between the rows. He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, Ali bin Isa has sanctity, service, and precedent, and the Commander of the Faithful has kindness towards him that is the guardian of his care and preservation. He has suffered loss and calamity in his guarantee as people know. The Commander of the Faithful has exceeded in harshness against him in demand and threatened him with whipping for money that would destroy his soul, which made his mind fly, took his wit, and stunned him from moving to free himself and devising means for what he owes, with lack of ability for that. If the Commander of the Faithful sees fit to treat me according to the good habits of his generosity to me, and accept my intercession for him regarding some of what he owes, it is a favor he renews for me guarding his previous kindness, and doubling the obligation of thanks for it.\" He continued to speak gently to him with this and the like until he deducted half of what he owed and limited it to twenty thousand dinars. Ghassan said: \"On condition that the Commander of the Faithful renews the guarantee for him and dismisses him with robes that strengthen his soul, sharpen his resolve, and let him know the place of satisfaction with him.\" Al-Mamun agreed to that. He said: \"Then permit me, O Commander of the Faithful, to carry the inkwell to your presence so you may sign what you saw of this favor, so the honor of carrying it remains with me and my descendants after me.\" He said: \"Do so.\" He carried the inkwell and brought it. Al-Mamun signed for him what he requested. Ali bin Isa went out with the robes on him and the signature in his hand. When he arrived at his house, he carried twenty thousand dinars of the money and returned it to Ghassan, thanking him for his beautiful deed with him. He said to his scribe: \"Did I intercede with the Commander of the Faithful to return the money to me? I only asked for its deduction so it would be saved for him to benefit from, and nothing of it returns to me ever.\" He returned the money to him. That was the cause of reconciliation between them. Ali bin Isa recognized the value of what Ghassan did for him and continued to serve him until the end of his life.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Judge Abu al-Qasim Ali bin al-Muhsin al-Tanukhi narrated in his book: Al-Suli told me: Muhammad bin al-Qasim bin Khallad told me: Some officials reported to Al-Mu'tasim—who had taken over the land tax and war (administration) previously handled by Khalid bin Yazid bin Mazyad—that Khalid bin Yazid had cut off funds and withheld some of them. Al-Mu'tasim became angry and swore to take Khalid's wealth, punish him, and exile him. Khalid sought refuge with Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad, the Judge. He used a stratagem until he brought him and his accuser together, and no proof was established against Khalid. The Judge Ibn Abi Du'ad informed Al-Mu'tasim of that and interceded with him for Khalid, but he did not accept his intercession. He summoned Khalid and brought instruments of punishment for him. Before that, he had seized his wealth and estates and dismissed him from work.\n\nIbn Abi Du'ad attended the assembly and sat lower than his usual seat. Al-Mu'tasim said to him: \"Rise to your place.\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, I deserve only below this seat.\" He said: \"How so?\" He said: \"People claim that my position is not that of one who intercedes for a man accused of what is not in him, against whom nothing was proven, yet his intercession was not accepted.\" He said: \"Then rise to your place.\" He said: \"Accepted or not accepted?\" He said: \"Accepted. I have gifted Khalid to you and am pleased with him.\" He said: \"The people do not know this.\" He said: \"I have returned to him all his estates and wealth that were seized.\" He ordered his shackles removed and gave him robes of honor. That was done. He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, he and his companions deserve six months' salary. If the Commander of the Faithful sees fit to make it a gift to him.\" He said: \"Let it be carried with him.\" Khalid went out wearing the robes with the money before him, while people were expecting his punishment. When they saw him in that state, they were happy. A man shouted to him: \"We praise Allah for your safety, O Master of the Arabs.\" He said: \"Hush! Rather, the Master of the Arabs, by Allah, is Ibn Abi Du'ad who collared me with this noble deed that will never be removed from my neck.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that a youth of wealth whose time had turned against him had a beautiful slave girl proficient in singing. They were straitened and their condition became severe in lack of food. He said to her: \"You see what bad state we have come to. By Allah, my death with you is easier for me than what I mention to you. It pains me to see you in a state other than what pleases me for you. The end of our matter is that death befalls one of us, and the other kills himself over him. If you see fit that I sell you to someone who will treat you well, washing away what you are in, and I get relief through what price might come to me, and perhaps you end up with someone through whom you can reach benefit for me.\" She said: \"By Allah, my death with you in this state is preferred by me over moving to another, even if he were a king. But do what seems best to you.\" He said: He went out and offered her for sale. A friend of his with opinion advised him to take her to Umar bin Ubaydullah bin Ma'mar, who was then Emir over Iraq. He said: He carried her to him. When she was presented to him, he admired her and said to her master: \"How much was her purchase price upon you?\" He said: \"One hundred thousand dirhams, and I have spent one hundred thousand dinars on her.\" He said: \"As for what you spent on her, it is not counted for you because you spent it on your pleasures. As for her price, we have ordered one hundred thousand dirhams for you, ten baskets of clothes, ten heads of horses, and ten slaves. Are you satisfied?\" He said: \"Yes, may Allah please the Emir.\" He ordered the money brought and ordered his head maid to take the girl into the harem. She held the side of the curtain, wept, and said:\n'Congratulations to you on the money you have gained... and nothing remains in my hand but regret.\nI say to my soul while it is in its distresses... Reduce or increase, for the beloved has departed.\nIf you have no trick for the matter... and find no escape from patience, then be patient.'\nHer master answered her saying:\n'Were it not for time sitting me down away from you... nothing would separate us but death, so excuse me.\nI go with a painful concern for your separation... whispering to a heart of little patience.\nPeace be upon you, no visit between us... and no union unless Ibn Ma'mar wills.'\nIbn Ma'mar said: \"I have willed. Take her, may Allah bless you in her and in what came from me to you.\" He took her, the money, horses, slaves, and clothes, and returned enriched, and his condition improved.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Musa bin al-Husayn bin Ziyad narrated: Muhammad bin Aws loved Ghars, a large-eyed slave girl belonging to Mutahhar al-Saghani. She would not go out for a day and night except for five dinars. When he summoned her and she went out to him, he would keep her for a month or more. She withheld herself from him at some times, using winter clothing as an excuse. He wrote her a note asking her to save him (visit him) and promising to speak to the Vizier about his salary to fulfill her desire. He wrote another note to the Vizier Ubaydullah bin Yahya bin Khaqan and went out early in the dark to meet the Vizier with the note. He mistook the two notes and carried in his sleeve the note he wrote to Ayna (Ghars). When he saw the Vizier, he went to dismount, but he prevented him from that. He greeted him and handed him the note. Ubaydullah called for a candle, brought it close, read the note on the way, summoned Ahmad bin al-Abbas, whispered to him, and said: \"Take this note and act according to what is in it.\" He revealed something to him secretly. He went to Ayna, bought the slave girl from her, bought a maid for her for one hundred dinars, and clothes for three hundred dinars, and went with all of them to Muhammad bin Aws's house. The Vizier had kept him until mealtime, so he had lunch with him and sat for drink. Ahmad bin al-Abbas said: When I obtained what he ordered me for him, I came to him. The Vizier said to me: \"What did you do regarding what I ordered you?\" I said: \"I have accomplished it.\" He said to Muhammad bin Aws: \"Go to your house, for the boy will meet you.\" When he entered his house, the slave girl met him cheerfully, coming towards him without shyness or reservation, whereas during his love for her she used to prevent him from approaching her. He proceeded according to his habit of refraining from her and leaving approaching her, based on what he knew of her. She said: \"Do not hold back, for I have no refusal from you today; I am now the property of your hands.\" He said: \"What is the story?\" She informed him of what happened with Ahmad bin al-Abbas by the order of the Vizier. He marveled at that and did not know its reason. Then he thought of the note and stood to look at the other note. He found the one he wrote to the Vizier remaining. He knew he had mistaken the two notes. He rode to the Vizier's house and asked permission to apologize to him. He sent word to him: \"You are a groom tonight. Go and stay in your wedding for seven days, then come to us after that.\" He returned to his house and stayed with the girl for days. Ubaydullah sent him a signature for his salary, having increased it and raised his rank. He went to him after that and thanked him for what he did for him.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said Aws bin Haritha al-Murri was a chief, noble, high-minded, and he has many stories. One of the best of them is what Abu al-Faraj al-Shalahi narrated from Ibn Hatim from Al-Asma'i, said: Abu Amr bin al-Ala' told us from his sheikhs: Al-Nu'man bin al-Mundhir sat on his day of bliss in a gilded robe collared with pearls, the like of which had not been seen. He permitted the Arabs to enter, and among them was Aws bin Haritha bin Lam al-Tai. He said: The faces of the Arabs began to marvel at the beauty of the robe and talk to each other, while Aws bin Haritha looked down. Al-Nu'man said: \"I do not see anyone who entered upon me but admired this robe despite its diminished value to me, except you, O Aws.\" He said:",

    "text": "\"O King, may your god make you happy and your time aid you. This is admired only if it is in the hand of its merchant. But if it is on the King, and his radiant face shines in it, eyes are restricted to him rather than it.\" He weighed his mind and appreciated what he said. Khalid bin Bishr hinted to Al-Nu'man requesting it. Al-Nu'man said: \"I will think tonight and give it tomorrow to the one I see as the Master of the Arabs.\" They left, every hopeful one concerned. When it was tomorrow, the faces of the Arabs adorned themselves and went early to Al-Nu'man's door, dragging their trails and looking at their sides, each thinking he was the owner of the robe. Aws bin Haritha delayed. His companions said to him: \"Why don't you go early to the King's house? Perhaps you will be the Master among the Arabs by taking it, and your pride will be complete.\" Aws said: \"Glory be to Allah! If I am the master of my people, I am not the master of the classes of Arabs in my own view. The King promised to give the robe to the Master of the Arabs, and I do not know him to be me or anyone else, but the King is worthier of his opinion. If I attend and do not take it, I leave diminished and worried. If I am the sought one, he will send for me.\" They stopped urging him, considering his opinion weak. He said: Al-Nu'man looked at the faces of the group and missed Aws, so what he thought occurred to him. He summoned one of his entourage and sent him as if finding out his news from his slaves. What he said was repeated to him. He repeated it to Al-Nu'man. He said: \"Go to him and tell him the King finds you slow for your delay, and summon him.\" He attended that day in the clothes he attended in yesterday. The faces of the Arabs were happy with his delay, sensing that the King would have given him the robe had he attended. When he took his seat in Al-Nu'man's presence, he raised him and brought him forward, then extended his hand to him and said: \"I see you did not change your clothes for your day, so wear this robe to beautify yourself with among those of your companions who beautified themselves.\" He wore it. The faces of the Arabs envied him and said: \"Nothing lowers his status except satire, and there is no one for him like Jarwal.\" They spoke to Jarwal (Al-Hutay'ah), but he said: \"I have no way against him. How can I satirize a man of noble lineage whose house is not denied, generous whose giving does not cease, virtuous whose opinion is not impugned, brave whose fire is not warmed by (approached), beneficent from whom I see nothing in my house except his favors?\" Then he said:\n'How can there be satire when a good deed... from the family of Lam never ceases coming to me unseen?'\nHe said: Bishr bin Abi Khazim, one of Banu Asad bin Khuzaima, heard of that. He desired the payment and resolved to satirize him. They gave him three hundred camels or thereabouts, so he satirized him. Aws targeted his camels which he had hastened to take—he had none before them—drove them away, and secured them with himself. He sought him to kill him. He fled from his hand and began seeking a mighty one to seek refuge with. He did not approach anyone but he said to him: \"I protect you from all people except Aws bin Haritha, for I do not like his enmity.\" While he was wandering, and Aws had set spies on him, one of those watching him saw him, seized him, and carried him to Aws. When he was in his hand, he consulted his mother Sa'da about him—he had satirized her excessively—and said: \"What killing do you like me to kill him with?\" She said: \"No, by Allah, O Aws! If you kill him, his words will be established like engraving on rock. Nothing erases his satire of you except his praise of you. So favor him, release him, and return to him what was taken from him.\" He knew the correct action was what she advised. He brought him and said to him: \"What do you think I will do to you?\" He said: \"Kill me.\" He said: \"You deserve that from me, but Sa'da pitied you and advised me regarding you a matter I am doing.\" Then he ordered him released. He untied him, returned his camels to him, added to them from his own, clothed him, gave him a mount, and said to him: \"Return to your family guided.\" He said: Bishr raised his hand and gaze to the sky and said: \"O Allah, bear witness against Bishr that he will praise no one but Aws bin Haritha as long as You extend life for him.\" He said: So he praised him with several poems established in his Diwan. From his sayings:\n'To Aws bin Haritha bin Lam... so he fulfills my need among those he fulfilled.\nWhen a banner is raised for glory... they set it up for him to reach its end.\nNo one trod the pebbles like Ibn Sa'da... nor wore sandals nor was shod with them.'\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Abdullah bin Mansur mentioned: I was one day in the assembly of Al-Fadl bin Yahya. The chamberlain came to him and said: 'There is a man at the door who has persisted in asking permission, claiming he has a favor (connection) by which he relates.' He said: 'Let him in.' A man of handsome face but shabby appearance entered. He greeted well. He gestured for him to sit, so he sat. When he knew he was at ease and could speak, he said to him: 'What is your need?' He said to him: 'My shabby appearance and weak capability have expressed it.' He said: 'Yes. So what is it you relate by?' He said: 'A birth close to your birth, a neighborhood close to your neighborhood, and a name derived from your name.' Al-Fadl said: 'As for the neighborhood, it is possible as you said, and the name may match the name, but what is your knowledge of the birth?' He said: 'My mother informed me that when she gave birth to me, she was told that a boy was born tonight to Yahya bin Khalid and named Al-Fadl, so she named me Fudayl in honor of your name to attach me to it \"and diminished it due to the shortness of my rank compared to yours\".' Al-Fadl smiled and said: 'How many years have passed over you?' He said: 'Thirty-five years.' He said: 'You spoke the truth; this is the amount I count for myself.' He said: 'What did your mother do?' He said: 'She died, may Allah have mercy on her.' He said: 'What prevented you from joining us in the past?' He said: 'I was in commonness and youthfulness that held me back from meeting kings.' He said: 'O boy, give him a thousand for every year that passed of his years, and give him of our clothes and mounts what befits him.' He did not leave the house until he was surrounded by his brothers and the elite of his family.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is narrated that a man came to Ubaydullah bin al-Abbas while he was in the courtyard of his house. He stood before him and said: 'O Ibn al-Abbas, I have a favor (hand) with you, and I have needed it.' He raised his eyes to him and lowered them but did not recognize him. Then he said to him: 'What is your favor with us, for I do not verify you?' He said: 'I saw you standing at Zamzam, and your boy drawing water for you from it. The sun was melting you, so I shaded you with the edge of my garment until you drank.' He said: 'Yes, I indeed remember that, and it wavers between my mind and thought.' Then he said to his steward: 'What do you have?' He said: 'Two hundred dinars and ten thousand dirhams.' He said: 'Give it all to him, and I do not see it fulfilling the right of his favor to us.' The man said to him: 'By Allah, if Ismail had no son but you, there would be sufficiency in you, so how is it when the Master of the first and last, Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, begot him, then \"interceded\" him with you and your father.'\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that a brother of Amr bin Dawsara fell in love with his cousin (daughter of his uncle) intensely. Her father hated that and refused. He complained about him to Khalid bin Abdullah al-Qasri, who was then over Iraq, mentioning that he was a bad neighbor and asked to imprison him. He imprisoned him. Then Khalid was asked about him, so he released him. The youth stayed for a period refraining from his cousin. Then what was in him increased and excessive longing overcame him. He forced himself to climb the wall of his uncle's house to see his daughter. He was detected and caught. He was brought to Khalid accused of theft, and a group was brought testifying they found him in the upper part of his house at night. Khalid asked him, and the youth confessed to theft to ward off suspicion from his cousin. Khalid resolved to cut off his hand. His brother wrote a note and gave it to someone to deliver to Khalid. In it was:\n'O Khalid, you have been trodden in darkness, by Allah... The oppressed lover among us does not steal.\nHe confessed to what he did not commit, except that... he saw cutting (the hand) better than the scandal of a lover.\nWere it not for fear of his hand being cut... you would have found the youth silent regarding the matter.\nIf goals appear in the race for highness... Ibn Abdullah is the first preceding.'\nKhalid sent a trusted client of his to uncover his state and find the truth of the matter. He brought him the truth of the boy's affair. He summoned his uncle and obliged him to marry the girl to her cousin. He refused and said: 'He is not a match for her.' He said: 'Yes, by Allah, he is above a match since he sacrificed his hand for her. If you do not marry him, I will marry her to him while you dislike it.' Her father married her, and Khalid paid the dowry on his behalf from his own money and ordered him to stick to him to benefit him. He stuck to him. The youth was called 'The Lover' until he died.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "And from Waqid bin Muhammad al-Waqidi who said: My father told us that he submitted a note to Al-Mamun mentioning abundance of debt and lack of patience with it. Al-Mamun wrote on the back of his note: \"You are a man in whom two qualities are combined: generosity and modesty. As for generosity, it released what was in your hand. As for modesty, it prevents you from informing us of what you are in. I have ordered one hundred thousand dirhams for you. If you are correct (in your assessment/need), increase in extending your hand. If I am not correct, your crime is against yourself, for you narrated to me—and I was in charge of judiciary for Al-Rashid—from Muhammad bin Ishaq from Al-Zuhri from Anas that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Al-Zubayr bin al-Awwam: 'O Zubayr, know that the provisions of servants are opposite the Throne. Allah Almighty sends to every servant according to his spending. Whoever increases, it is increased for him, and whoever decreases, it is decreased for him, and you know best.'\" Al-Waqidi said: \"By Allah, Al-Mamun's reminding me of the hadith was dearer to me than the reward 'and the hundred thousand'.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** It is authenticated that Abu Talib bin Kathir was a Shiite. A man said to him: \"By the right of Ali bin Abi Talib, gift me your palm trees in such-and-such place.\" He said: \"I have done so. And by his right, I will give you what adjoins them.\" That was multiples of what the man asked.\n\n**Anecdote:** Some narrators mentioned that Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan gifted Ubaydullah bin al-Abbas, while he was with him in Sham, gifts of Nowruz: many robes, musk, and vessels of gold and silver, and sent them with his chamberlain. When he placed them before him, he looked at the chamberlain looking at them. He said: \"Is there anything of it in your soul (do you desire it)?\" He said: \"Yes, by Allah, there is in my soul of it what was in Jacob's soul of Joseph.\" Ubaydullah laughed and said: \"Take them, they are yours.\" He said: \"May I be your ransom, I fear Muawiyah will hear of it and be angry with me.\" He said: \"Seal them with your ring and give them to the treasurer. When it is time for our departure, he will carry them to you at night.\" The chamberlain said: \"By Allah, this trick in generosity is greater than the generosity itself. I wish I would not die until I see you in his place\"—meaning Muawiyah. Ubaydullah thought it was a ploy from him, so he said: \"Leave this talk, for we are a people who fulfill what we promised and do not break what we confirmed.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said Abu Mazyad was one of the generous. A poet praised him. He said to the poet: \"By Allah, I have nothing to give you, but take me to the judge and claim ten thousand dirhams against me. I will acknowledge it to you, then imprison me, for my family will not leave me imprisoned.\" He did that. He did not spend the evening until ten thousand dirhams were paid to him, and Abu Mazyad was released from prison.\n\n**Anecdote:** Ma'n bin Zaida was governor of the two Iraqs in Basra. A poet attended his door and stayed for a period wanting to enter upon him but could not. One day he said to some of his servants: \"If the Emir enters the garden, inform me.\" When he entered, he informed him. The poet wrote a verse of poetry on a piece of wood and threw it in the water entering Ma'n's garden. Ma'n was sitting at the head of the water. When he saw the wood, he took it and read it. Written on it was:\n'O generosity of Ma'n, whisper to Ma'n about my need... For I have no way to Ma'n other than you.'\nHe said: \"Who is the owner of this?\" The man was called. He said: \"How did you say?\" He recited the verse. He ordered ten bags of money for him. He took them. The Emir put the wood under his rug. When it was the second day, he took it out from under the rug, read what was on it, called the man, and gave him another one hundred thousand dirhams. Likewise on the third day. When the man took it from him, he thought and feared he might take back what he gave him. He left \"and went on his way.\" When it was the fourth day, he read what was on it, called the man, sought him but he wasn't found. Ma'n said: \"It was incumbent upon me to give him until not a dirham or dinar remained in the treasury.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said Harun al-Rashid sent five hundred dinars to Malik bin Anas, may Allah be pleased with him. This reached Al-Layth bin Sa'd, so he sent him a thousand dinars. Al-Rashid became angry and said: \"I give him five hundred dinars and you give him a thousand dinars, while you are one of my subjects?\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, I have from my yield a thousand dinars every day, so I was ashamed to give the likes of him less than the income of a day.\" It is told that Zakat never became obligatory upon him (because he spent it all), even though his income was a thousand dinars every day.\n\n**Anecdote:** Sa'id bin Khalid entered upon Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik. He was a generous man; if he found nothing, he would write checks against himself for those who asked him until his stipend came out. When Sulayman looked at him, he quoted this verse:\n'I heard with the morning a caller... O who helps the helpful youth against time?'\nThen he said: \"Your need?\" He said: \"My debt.\" He said: \"How much is it?\" He said: \"Thirty thousand dinars.\" He said: \"You have your debt and the like of it.\"\n\n**Anecdote:**",

He said: \"May Allah disgrace wealth that prevents brothers from visiting.\" Then he ordered a crier who called out: \"Whoever Qays has a right against, he is absolved of it.\" His doorstep was broken \"in the evening\" due to the large number of those visiting him.\n\n**Anecdote:** Sheikh Abu Sa'id \"al-Kharkushi al-Naysaburi said: I heard\" Muhammad bin Muhammad al-Hafiz say: I heard \"Al-Shafi'i say: There was a man in Egypt known for collecting for the poor. A child was born to one of them. He said: I came to him and said: 'A child was born to me and I have nothing.' He stood up with me and entered upon a group, but nothing opened up for him. He came to the grave of a man he knew, sat by it, and said: 'May Allah have mercy on you, you used to do and make. I went around today seeking a group for something for a newborn, but nothing worked out for me.' Then he stood up, took out a dinar, broke it in half, gave me half and said: 'This is a debt upon you until Allah opens something for you.' I took it and left and fixed what I could with it. That night, \"the Muhtasib\" saw \"that person, the owner of the grave, in his dream saying: 'I heard all you said, and we do not have permission to answer. But go to my house and tell my children to dig the place of the stove and take out a skin containing five hundred dinars and carry it to this man.' He said: When it was tomorrow, he went to the dead man's house and told the story. They said to him: 'Sit.' They dug the place, took out the dinars, brought them, and placed them before him. He said: 'This is your money, and my dream has no ruling.' They said: 'He is generous dead, and we will not be generous alive? By Allah, we will not hold back anything of it.' When they insisted on him, he carried the dinars to the man with the newborn and mentioned the story to him. He said: He took a dinar from it, broke it in half, gave him the half he had lent him, carried the other half, and said: 'This suffices me; give the rest in charity to the poor.' Abu Sa'id said: I do not know which of these is more generous: the dead man, the asker, or his children?\n\n**Anecdote:** It is narrated that when Al-Shafi'i fell ill with his fatal illness, he said: 'Order So-and-so to wash me.' When he died, the news of his death reached him, so he attended and said: 'Bring me his notebook.' It was brought, and he looked into it. There were seventy thousand dirhams against Al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him. He wrote them against himself \"and paid them for him,\" and said: 'This is my washing of him,' meaning he only intended this.\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, said: I continue to love Hammad bin Abi Sulayman for something that reached me about him. \"That is,\" he was one day riding a donkey of his. He moved it, and his button broke. He passed by a tailor and wanted to get down to him to fix his button. The tailor said: 'By Allah, do not get down.' He stood up to him and fixed his button while he was riding. He brought out a purse containing ten dinars to him, handed it to the tailor, and apologized to him for its smallness.\n\n**Anecdote:** From Al-Rabi' bin Sulayman who said: A man held Al-Shafi'i's stirrup, may Allah be pleased with him. He said: 'O Rabi', give him four dinars and apologize to him for me.'\n\n**Anecdote:** It is narrated that Talha al-Talhat went out on a summer day. Heat struck him and he became thirsty. He looked at a house with a nice courtyard and extended shade. He turned to it, sat down, then asked for water. A clean maid came out to him with a clean vessel containing cold water. He drank and said: 'O maid, how clean you are and how clean what is with you!' She said: 'May I be your ransom, if my family knew of your location, they would have trusted (been generous) in what they sent to you.' He marveled at her intelligence and her family's generosity. He asked about the owner of the house. It was said he was hiding due to a debt he incurred, and the house was pawned to his creditor for a thousand dinars. He sent to the man and brought him out, sent to the creditor and paid him his money, returned the house to the man, gave him a generous gift, and said: 'Whenever misery touches you from your time, seek us, for I am your helper against your time.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Rabi' said: I heard Al-Humaydi say: Al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, arrived from Sana'a to Mecca with ten thousand dinars. He pitched his tent in a place outside Mecca and scattered the dinars on a cloth. Then he turned to everyone who entered upon him, grabbed a handful, and gave him until he prayed Dhuhr, and shook the cloth with nothing on it.\n\n**Anecdote:** Muhammad bin Abbad al-Muhallabi said: My father entered upon Al-Mamun, so he gifted him one hundred thousand dirhams. When he stood up from his presence, he gave it in charity. Al-Mamun was informed of that. When he returned to him, he blamed him for that. He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, withholding generosity is from bad opinion of the Worshipped.' So he gifted him another two hundred thousand.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

When he was about to drink, a man said: 'Ah, Ah.' My cousin signaled to me to go to him. \"He said: I came to him,\" and it was Hisham bin al-Aas. I said: 'Shall I give you drink?' Another heard me and said: 'Ah, Ah.' Hisham signaled to me to go to him. I came to him, and he was dead. I returned to Hisham, and he was dead. Then I returned to my cousin, and he was dead.\n\n**Anecdote:** A man entered upon Salim bin Qutayba al-Bahili to speak to him about a need. He placed the blade of his sword on Salim's finger and leaned on it. He began speaking to him about his need while making him bleed, and Salim was patient. When the man finished his need and left, Salim called for a handkerchief, wiped the blood from his finger, and washed it. It was said to him: 'Why didn't you move your leg, may Allah amend you, or order him to lift his sword from it?' He said: 'I feared I would cut him off from his need.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Khuzaim bin Abi Yahya al-Muzani mentioned that Al-Rashid invited him one day to eat with him. While eating, he raised his head to a man speaking to him in Persian. He said: I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, if you want to speak secretly to him, I understand Persian.' He ordered me to step aside so he could proceed with what he wanted. Al-Rashid admired his noble manners and truthfulness, spoke to that man secretly as he wished, and ordered a splendid gift for Khuzaim.\n\n**Anecdote:** It was mentioned that a beggar came to Ubaydullah bin al-Abbas while he did not know him and said to him: 'Give me charity, for I was informed that Ubaydullah bin al-Abbas gave a beggar a thousand dirhams and apologized to him.' He said: 'Where am I compared to Ubaydullah?' He said: 'Where are you compared to him in lineage or in generosity?' He said: 'In both.' He said: 'As for lineage in a man, it is his manliness and deed. If you wish, you do, \"and if you do,\" you are of noble lineage.' He gave him two thousand dirhams and apologized to him for the tightness of his funds. The beggar said to him: 'If you are not Ubaydullah bin al-Abbas, you are better than him; and if you are him, you are better today than you were yesterday.' He gave him another thousand. The beggar said to him: 'This is the vibration of a noble person of lineage. By Allah, you have pecked the grain of my heart and emptied it into your heart. You only erred by interception of the secret from my ribs (knowing who I am/my secret).'\n\n**Anecdote:** \"Among the witty tales mentioned about keeping secrets and concealing them is what\" Abu Sufyan al-Himyari and Salih bin Sulayman \"narrated\": Al-Walid bin Yazid wanted to perform Hajj. A group of the notables of Sham conspired to attack him. They came to Khalid bin Abdullah al-Qasri to be with them, but he refused them. They said: 'Then keep our secret.' He said: 'As for this, yes.' Khalid al-Qasri walked to Khalid bin al-Walid bin Yazid and said to him: 'Tell the Commander of the Faithful to forego Hajj this year.' He said: 'Why?' He said: 'I fear for him.' Khalid informed his father, so he summoned him. He said: 'Is what Khalid says about you true, O Khalid?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Repeat it to me.' He repeated his saying. He said: 'Who are these whom you fear for me? Name them.' He said: 'I will not do it.' He said: 'You surely will say.' He said: 'I will not say.' He said: 'Then I will send you to Yusuf bin Umar.' He said: 'Even if you do.' He sent him to Yusuf, who tortured him until he died, and he did not name the group nor anyone of them.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said when Umar bin Abd al-Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, became Caliph, he wrote to the governor of Basra to bring Iyas bin Muawiyah al-Muzani and Al-Qasim bin Rabi'a al-Jawshani, and to look at the more effective of them in judgment and appoint him. When he read the letter, he summoned them and read it to them. Iyas said to him: 'Ask the two jurists of the city, Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin, about me and him.' Al-Qasim was a friend of theirs. He realized what Iyas intended. He said: 'O Emir, do not ask anyone about me and him. Listen from me and him.' He said: 'Speak.' He said: 'By Allah, besides Whom there is no god'—and he swore a complete oath gathering the meanings of swearing—'Indeed Iyas bin Muawiyah is more fit for judgment than me and more effective in it. If I am truthful to you, appoint him \"by my oath\"; and if I am a liar to you, it is not lawful for you to appoint to judge between Muslims one who challenges Allah with such an oath lying.' Iyas said: 'Do not listen to him, O Emir, for you brought him to the brink of Hell, so he ransomed himself from falling into it with an oath he swore lying; he will expiate for it and ask Allah's forgiveness for it and be saved \"from what was\".' The Emir said to him: 'Did you not understand it yourself, O Iyas?' And he appointed him to judge between people.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

He left nothing but some ten dinars. He ordered that he be shrouded and a place be bought for his burial for five dinars, and the rest be divided among his heirs. Each son received half and a quarter of a dinar. He said: 'O my sons, I have no wealth to bequeath regarding it, but I have left you while no one has a claim against you. The eye of none of you falls on anyone except he sees a right for him upon you.' Maslama said to him: 'Is there better than that, O Commander of the Faithful?' He said: 'What is it?' He said: 'Here is three hundred thousand dinars; distribute it among them, or if you wish, give it in charity.' He said: 'Is there better than that, O Maslama?' He said: 'What is it?' He said: 'Return it to the one you took it from, for it is not rightfully yours.' Maslama said to him: 'May Allah have mercy on you, O Commander of the Faithful, alive and dead. You have softened hard hearts of ours, reminded them even if they were forgetful, and left for us a mention among the righteous.' It is said that no one of Umar bin Abd al-Aziz's children was ever seen except rich. One of them was seen equipping one hundred horsemen on one hundred horses in the path of Allah from his pure wealth. When death approached Hisham bin Abd al-Malik, he left eleven sons just as Umar left. He made a bequest, and each one of the sons received one million dinars. It is said that no one of them was ever seen except poor. One of them was seen stoking the furnace of a bathhouse for filling his belly.\n\n**Anecdote:** Ahmad bin Musa narrated: Al-Rabi' said: I have not seen a man more composed or steadfast of heart than a man reported to the Commander of the Faithful Al-Mansur as having deposits and wealth belonging to Banu Umayya. He ordered me to bring him. I brought him and entered with him. Al-Mansur said to him: 'News of deposits and wealth \"you have\" for Banu Umayya has been raised to us, so bring them out to us.' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, are you an heir to Banu Umayya?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Are you an executor for them regarding their wealth and properties?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Then what is your questioning about what is in my hand of that?' Al-Mansur looked down for an hour, then raised his head to him and said: 'Banu Umayya wronged the Muslims regarding it. I am the agent of the Muslims regarding their right, and I want to take what they wronged the Muslims in and put it in their treasury.' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, you need to establish just proof that what is in my hand for Banu Umayya is from what they betrayed and wronged in, excluding other things, for Banu Umayya had wealth other than the Muslims' wealth.' He said: Al-Mansur looked down for an hour, then raised his head to him and said: 'He spoke the truth, O Rabi', nothing is obligated on the Sheikh.' Then he said: 'Do you have a need?' He said: 'My need, O Commander of the Faithful, is that you send my letter by post to my family so they are reassured of my safety, for my departure alarmed them. And I have another need, O Commander of the Faithful.' He said: 'What is it?' He said: 'Bring together me and the one who slandered me to you. By Allah, Banu Umayya have no wealth or deposit in my hand. But when I stood before you and you asked me what you asked, I knew nothing would save me from you except this saying, due to your fame for justice. So I said: That is closer to salvation and safety.' He said: 'O Rabi', bring him and the one who slandered him together.' I brought them together. He recognized him and said: 'This is my slave; he stole three thousand dinars of wealth from me and fled from me \"and feared my seeking him, so he slandered me to the Commander of the Faithful\".' He said: Al-Mansur was harsh on the slave \"and frightened him,\" so he confessed he was his slave, that he took the money he mentioned and fled, and that he slandered him falsely out of fear of falling into his hand. Al-Mansur said to the Sheikh: 'We ask you to forgive him.' He said: 'I have forgiven him and his crime, freed him, and gifted him the three thousand he took and another three thousand.' Al-Mansur said to him: 'There is no increase upon what you have done.' He said: 'Rather, this is the right of your speech, O Commander of the Faithful,' and left. Al-Mansur used to marvel at him whenever he mentioned him and say: 'I have never seen the like of that Sheikh, O Rabi'.'\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said a man stayed at Ma'n's door for a period not reaching him. When his stay prolonged, he wrote a note to him containing:\n'Not all good is in your hand, O Ma'n... In the earth are causes and in it are ways.\nThe daughters of life (days/nights) will come with what you do... when the bags are searched for the return.'\nHe appointed someone to deliver it to him and traveled. When it reached him and he read it, he ordered his return and said: 'By Allah, he shall search for much good.' He ordered his bag to be filled with dirhams.\n\n**Anecdote:** An Arab said: I went out in some black nights and saw a girl like an idol. I seduced her for herself. She said: 'O you, do you not have a deterrent of reason if you have no deterrent of religion?' Her words shamed me. I said: 'I was only joking.' She said:\n'And beware, beware of joking, for it... makes the child and the vile man covet you.\nIt removes the water of the face (dignity) after its modesty... and bequeaths humiliation to its owner after honor.'\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** It is narrated that a man from the Ansar came to Abdullah bin al-Abbas and said to him: 'O cousin of the Messenger of Allah, a boy was born to me tonight, and I named him with your name seeking blessing by it, and his mother died.' Abdullah said: 'May Allah bless you in the gift (child) and increase your patience in the calamity.' Then he called his agent and said: 'Go immediately and buy a maid for the newborn to nurse him and give him two hundred dinars for the expense of raising him.' Then he said to the Ansari: 'Return to us after days, for you came to us while life is miserable and money is scarce.' The Ansari said: 'May I be your ransom, if you had preceded Hatim by one day, the Arabs would never have mentioned him. But he preceded you, so you became a follower. I testify that your pardon is more than his generosity, and the drizzle of your nobility is more than his downpour.'\n\n**Anecdote:** He said: Two men left Medina wanting Abdullah bin Amir bin Kurayz to visit him. One was a descendant of Jabir bin Abdullah al-Ansari, and the other from Thaqif. Abdullah was the governor of Iraq for Uthman bin Affan, may Allah be pleased with him. They traveled until they were in the region of Basra. The Ansari said to the Thaqafi: 'Do you agree with an idea I had?' He said: 'Present it.' He said: 'We make our mounts kneel, perform ablution, and pray two rak'ahs praising Allah Almighty in them for what He decreed of our travel.' He said: 'Yes, this is an opinion not to be rejected.' He said: So they did. Then the Ansari turned to the Thaqafi and said to him: 'O brother of Thaqif, what is your opinion?' He said: 'What place for opinion is this? I have finished my travel, exhausted my body, and tired my mount, and there is no hope but Ibn Amir. Do you have an opinion other than this?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'What is it?' He said: 'When I prayed, I thought and felt shy from my Lord that He sees me seeking sustenance from other than Him.' Then he said: 'O Allah, Provider of Ibn Amir, provide for me from Your bounty.' Then he turned back to Medina. The Thaqafi entered Basra and stayed at Ibn Amir's door for days. When he was permitted, he entered upon him. He had been written to with their news. When he saw him, he welcomed him and said: 'Was I not informed that Ibn Jabir left with you?' He told him what happened with them. Ibn Amir wept and said: 'By Allah, he did not say it out of arrogance or ungratefulness, but he saw the flow of sustenance and the exit of blessing, so he knew Allah is the One who did that, so he asked Him of His bounty.' Then he ordered four thousand dirhams, clothes, and curiosities for the Thaqafi, and doubled that for the Ansari. The Thaqafi left saying:\n'Umama, the striving of the greedy does not increase... a wick, nor does the incapacity of the weak harm.\nWe left together from our birthplaces... trusting in the generosity of Ibn Amir.\nWhen we made the she-camels kneel at his door... The Yathribi Ibn Jabir held back from me.\nHe said: The gift of a Capable One will suffice me... over what He wills today for creation, Omnipotent.\nFor He who gave Iraq to Ibn Amir... is my Lord whom I hope for plugging my poverty.\nWhen he saw me, he said: Ibn Jabir?... and yearned as the stallion of camels yearns.\nSo Abdullah doubled, when his person was absent... for the luck of a sorrowful one, gaping with greed.'\n\n**Anecdote:** He said: Some Kharijites rebelled against Al-Rashid. He sent an army against him and captured him. When he entered upon him, he said: 'What do you want me to do with you?' He said: 'What you want Allah to do with you when you stand before Him.' Al-Rashid looked down for a long time, then raised his head and ordered his release. When he left, some of those present said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, he kills your men, exhausts your money, and you release him with one word? Consider this matter, for it emboldens evil people against you.' He ordered him brought back. When he stood before him, he knew he had been slandered. He said: 'Commander of the Faithful, do not obey them regarding me. If Allah obeyed them regarding you, He would not have made you Caliph for a single moment.' He ordered his release and said: 'No one is to review me regarding his affair.'\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said Ma'n bin Zaida was brought prisoners. He offered them to the sword. One of them said: 'We are your prisoners, O Emir, and we need some food.' He ordered that for them. Leather mats were spread, and food was brought. He said to his companions: 'Eat thoroughly.' Ma'n was looking at them and marveling at them. When they finished eating, he stood up and said: 'O Emir, we were your prisoners before, and we are now your guests. Look what you do with your guests.' He pardoned them and let them go. Some of those present said to him: 'We do not know, O Emir, which of your two days is more noble: the day of your victory or the day of your pardon!'\n\n**Anecdote:** Ruh bin Muqatil said: When Buran bint al-Hasan bin Sahl was wedded to Al-Mamun, his favorite Arib wrote to him saying:\n'May you be blessed, the eyes of death missed you... by the wedding of Buran with time, the egg of a chamber.\nHer star does not cease... running with the star of the trusted one (Mamun) of mankind.\nUntil the dominion settled in her lap... blessed in that form a lap.\nO my master, do not forget my covenant... I ask nothing but what you know.'\nBuran read the note and said: 'I know what you want.' Then she said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, grant permission for her to be wedded to you, for that, by Allah, is her reward for her poetry.' He said: 'That is up to you.' She did so, and she was wedded with her. Al-Mamun was pleased with the harmony that gathered for him between his wife and his favorite.",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** Sa'id bin Muslim al-Bahili said: An Arab from Bahila came to Al-Rashid. He wore a jubba of ink-colored cloth and a Yemeni cloak which he tied around his waist then folded over his shoulder, and a turban he wrapped around his cheeks, letting a tail hang behind him. He sat before Al-Rashid. Sa'id said to him: \"O Arab, speak on the nobility of the Commander of the Faithful.\" He launched into his poetry. Al-Rashid said to him: \"O Arab, I hear you doing well, and remember you as understanding. Say two verses about these two\"—meaning his sons Muhammad Al-Amin and Abdullah Al-Mamun, who were around him. He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, the awe of the Caliphate, the dazzling of the rank, and the shying away of rhymes from improvisation have taken me up the rugged hill and removed me from the easy level ground. Return me so their shy ones become familiar to me and my awe calms down.\" He said: \"I have done so, and made your excuse a substitute for your examination.\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, you relieved the choke and released the field for the race.\" Then he began saying:\n'You built with Abdullah and then Muhammad... the peaks of the dome of Islam, so its wood turned green.\nThey are its two ropes, may Allah bless them... and you, O Commander of the Faithful, are its pillar.'\nAl-Rashid said to him: \"And you, O Arab, may Allah bless you. Ask, and let not your request be less than your performance.\" He said: \"One hundred she-camels, O Commander of the Faithful.\" He ordered one hundred she-camels and seven robes for him.\n\n**Anecdote:** They said: Umara bin Hamza entered upon Al-Mansur and sat in his assembly. A man stood up and said: \"Oppressed, O Commander of the Faithful.\" He said: \"Who wronged you?\" He said: \"Umara seized my estate.\" Al-Mansur said: \"Stand up, O Umara, and sit with your adversary.\" He said: \"He is not an adversary to me, O Commander of the Faithful.\" He said: \"How is that?\" He said: \"If the estate is his, I do not dispute him over it; and if it is mine, it is his. I will not stand from a seat the Commander of the Faithful honored me with and raised me to, and sit in a lower one because of an estate!\"\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said that when the matter (rule) fell apart for Marwan al-Ja'di and he was certain of the loss of his kingdom and the victory of Banu Hashim over it, he said to Abd al-Hamid bin Yahya, his scribe: \"I need you to be with my enemy and show them betrayal of me. Their admiration for your literary skill and their need for you will invite them to have a good opinion of you. If you can benefit me in my life, and not be unable to preserve my sanctity after my death.\" Abd al-Hamid said: \"What you ordered me is the more beneficial of the two matters for you and the uglier for me. I have nothing but loyalty until Allah opens for you or I am killed with you.\" Then he said:\n'I keep loyalty secret then show betrayal... Who will provide me with an excuse whose appearance encompasses people?'\n\n**Anecdote:** Umar bin Shabba narrated, said: Muti' bin Iyas visited Yazid bin Jarir bin Abdullah al-Qasri and praised him with his poem which begins:\n'Were you denied the early morning from the family of Layla... and did not meet Layla to cure the slimness?\nYou were throughout your time in the past... a visitor to Layla and Layla's neighbors.'\nUntil he says in his praise in it:\n'My daughter says when she sees my travel... and I brought near for departure white camels and saddles:\nTo whom do I see you—may my soul be your ransom against deaths—... enduring this destiny?\nI said: To the stallion who... frees the captive and enriches the poor.\nThe brother of Arabs, most resembling in generosity... and carrying burdens his father Jarir.\nWhen beggars find the little much... he finds the much little for those seeking gifts.\nWhen good becomes difficult among beggars... it is ready and easy with him.\nHe is not one to prevent a person of need... nor forsake one who comes seeking refuge.\nWith my soul I ransom you, O Abu Khalid... when enemies raid the throats.'",

    "text": "When news of his arrival reached Yazid, he summoned him at night, and no one knew of his presence. Then he said to him: 'I have known your news, and I am hastening your reward this very hour. When you attend tomorrow, I will address you with harshness, provide you with travel expenses, and dismiss you so that news of me does not reach Abu Ja'far al-Mansur and destroy me.' He ordered two hundred dinars for him and dismissed him. When morning came, he came to him and asked permission to recite. He said to him: 'O you, you have aimed your hope at a wrong target. What am I that poets should seek me? You have done wrong to me because I cannot fulfill your desire, and I am not safe from your anger and blame.' He said to him: 'Listen to what I say, for I accept your available means and extend your excuse.' He listened to him as if coerced. When he finished, he said to his slave: 'O boy, how much remains of your expenses?' He said: 'Three hundred dirhams.' He said: 'Give him one hundred dirhams for his travel expenses, and one hundred dirhams to return to his family, and keep one hundred dirhams for your expenses.' The boy did that. Muti' left him thankful, and Abu Ja'far did not know their news.\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Asma'i said: I intended one day a man I used to visit for his generosity. I found a doorman at his door who prevented me from entering. Then he said: 'By Allah, O Asma'i, nothing stopped me at his door to prevent the likes of you from entering except the thinness of his condition and the shortness of his hand.' I wrote a note saying:\n'If the generous one has a veil... then what is the virtue of the generous over the mean?'\nThen I said to him: 'Deliver this note of mine to him.' He did. The note returned with writing on its back:\n'If the generous one has little money... he covers with the veil from the creditor.'\nHe sent with the note a purse containing five hundred dinars. I said: 'By Allah, I will gift the Commander of the Faithful this news, for nothing like it has passed me.' I came to him. When he saw me, he said: 'From where, O Asma'i?' I said: 'From the most generous of the living, excluding the Commander of the Faithful.' He said: 'And who is he?' I said: 'A man whose knowledge and wealth matched.' Then I handed him the note and the purse \"and recounted the news to him. When he saw the purse, his face changed color.\" He said: 'This is the seal of my treasury. I must have the man to whom I gave it.' I said: 'By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, I am ashamed to frighten him with your messengers.' He said to some of his intimates: 'Go with Al-Asma'i. If the man sees you, say to him: Answer the Commander of the Faithful without disturbance or showing severity.' He said: When the man attended before the Commander of the Faithful, he said: 'Are you not the one who stood in our procession yesterday and complained to us of the thinness of your condition and that time had knelt upon you with its weight? We gave you this purse to improve your condition, then Al-Asma'i intended you with one verse of poetry and you gave it to him.' He said: 'By Allah, I did not lie in what I complained to the Commander of the Faithful regarding the thinness of condition and difficulty of time, but I was ashamed before Allah to return one intending me except as the Commander of the Faithful returned me.' The Commander of the Faithful said: 'To Allah you belong! The Arabs have not given birth to one more generous than you.' Then he ordered a thousand dinars for him. Al-Asma'i said: 'I said: Join me (include me), O Commander of the Faithful.' He smiled and ordered a thousand dinars to be completed for me and returned the man to be among his boon companions.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Salih bin Ali al-Adkham, one of the prominent scribes, narrated: My unemployment lasted long, and need reached its peak with me. I went early one day to Ahmad bin Abi Khalid the Vizier to inform him of my disordered affairs and ask him to mend my disarray. He came out of his door with candles before him intending Al-Mamun's house. When he looked at me, he disapproved of my earliness and frowned in my face and said: 'Is there anyone in the world who comes this early to distract us from our affairs?' I said: 'The wonder is not from you, may Allah amend you, in how you met me; rather the wonder is from me, as I stayed up my night and kept all my family awake waiting for the morning to come to you regarding fixing my affairs after the choice fell on you for what I hope from you. But upon me and upon me'—and he swore by the oaths of allegiance—'if I stand at a door for you or ask you a need until you come to me apologizing for how you met me.' I left distressed, thinking about it, regretting the oath that escaped me, despairing of relief due to the unlikelihood of the Vizier coming to me and apologizing. Blaming myself, while I was like that, a servant entered and said: 'The Vizier Ahmad bin Abi Khalid has taken our street.' Then another entered and said: 'He entered our alley.' A third entered and said: 'He is near our door.' Another entered and said: 'He has entered our house.' I went out meeting him. When he settled in the assembly, he said to me: 'The Commander of the Faithful had ordered me to come early to him for some important matters. I entered upon him, and sleeplessness and grief over what escaped me towards you had affected me so much that he denied my state. I told him the story. He said: \"You have mistreated the man, and you must apologize to him.\" I said: \"Do I go to him empty-handed?\" He said: \"So what do you want?\" I said: \"Pay his debt.\" He said: \"How much is it?\" I said: \"Three hundred thousand dirhams.\" He ordered me to sign for it for you. I said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, if he pays his debt, what does he return to?\" He said: \"Sign for him another three hundred thousand to fix his condition.\" I said: \"And a governorship to be honored by?\" He said: \"He has [that] or others like it.\" I said: \"And aid to help him with his travel?\" He ordered to sign for you one hundred thousand dirhams. All these signatures are yours for all that.' He scattered them from his sleeve and left.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said Al-Mahdi vowed the blood of a man from Kufa who was striving to corrupt his state, and put a reward of one hundred thousand dirhams for anyone who indicated him or brought him. The man stayed in hiding for a time, then appeared in the City of Peace (Baghdad). While he was walking in some of its districts, a man from Kufa saw him, recognized him, grabbed his clothes, and said: 'This is the quest of the Commander of the Faithful.' While the man was in that state, he heard hoofbeats behind him. He turned, and it was Ma'n bin Zaida. He said: 'O Abu al-Walid, protect me, may Allah protect you.' He stopped and said to the man clinging to him: 'What is your affair?' He said: 'The quest of the Commander of the Faithful whose blood he vowed and gave one hundred thousand dirhams to whoever leads to him.' He said: 'O boy, get off your beast and put the man on it.' The clinger shouted: 'O people! Is a barrier put between me and the quest of the Commander of the Faithful?' Ma'n said to him: 'Go and tell him he is with me.' The man went to Al-Mahdi's door, informed the chamberlain, entered Al-Mahdi, and informed him. He ordered Ma'n to be brought. Messengers came to him. He called his family and clients and said: 'No evil shall reach this man while an eye among you blinks.' Then he marched to Al-Mahdi, entered and greeted. He did not return his greeting. He said: 'O Ma'n, do you protect against me?' He said: 'Yes, O Commander of the Faithful.' He said: 'And yes too?' His anger intensified. He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, I killed in your obedience in Yemen in one day fifteen thousand, in addition to many days. My trial and good service have preceded. Did you not see me worthy that one man who sought my protection be gifted to me?' Al-Mahdi looked down for a long time, then raised his head, his anger cleared. He said: 'We have protected whom you protected, O Ma'n.' Ma'n said: 'If the Commander of the Faithful sees fit to reward him, he would have revived him and enriched him.' He said: 'We have ordered fifty thousand dirhams for him.' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, the rewards of Caliphs are according to the crimes of the subjects. The man's sin is great, so make the reward generous.' He said: 'We have ordered one hundred thousand dirhams for him.' He said: 'Then hasten it for him, O Commander of the Faithful, for the best good is the hastened one.' He ordered it hastened for him. Ma'n left with the money to the man and said to him: 'Take your reward and join your family, and beware of opposing the Caliphs of Allah Almighty.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu Abdullah al-Nadim said: I have seen kings in their compartments and gatherings, and I have not seen anyone more abundant in literature than Al-Wathiq. He came out to us one day saying: 'By my life, he exposed his honor who exposed it to the saying of Al-Khuza'i:\nMy friend, what do I hope for from the tomorrow of a man... who turned away from me today while he is capable?\nAnd indeed a man who was stingy to me with speech... to block with it a need of a man is indeed stingy.'",

Al-Wathiq said to him: 'O Abu Abdullah, you have increased regarding what is neither much nor good.' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, he is my friend.\nAnd the easiest a friend gives his friend... of the easy available is to speak.'\nAl-Wathiq said: 'What is the worth of this Yamami to be your friend? It is enough for him to be one of your servants.' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, he became famous for seeking intercession through me with you, and placed me in view and hearing of rejection or aid. If I do not stand for him in this position, I would be then as the Commander of the Faithful said:\nMy friend, what do I hope for from the tomorrow of a man... who turned away from me today while he is capable?\nAnd indeed a man who was stingy to me with speech... to block with it a need of a man is indeed stingy.'\nAl-Wathiq said to Muhammad bin Abd al-Malik al-Zayyat: 'By Allah, O Muhammad, hasten Abu Abdullah's need so he is safe from the shame of procrastination as he was safe from the shame of rejection.'\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said a man asked Hatim al-Tai: 'O Hatim, has anyone overcome you in generosity?' He said: 'Yes, an orphan boy from Tayy. I stopped at his courtyard. He had ten heads of sheep. He took one head, slaughtered it, prepared its meat, and presented it to me. Among what he presented was the brain. I ate some of it and found it good. I said: \"Good, by Allah.\" He went out from my presence and began slaughtering head after head, presenting the brain to me while I did not know. When I went out to leave, I saw huge blood around his house, and behold, he had slaughtered all the sheep. I said to him: \"Why did you do that?\" He said: \"Glory be to Allah! You find something I own good, and I be stingy with it to you? That would be an ugly disgrace on the Arabs.\"' It was said: 'O Hatim, what did you compensate him with?' He said: 'Three hundred red she-camels and five hundred heads of sheep.' It was said: 'Then you are more generous than him.' He said: 'Nay, he is more generous, because he gave all he owned, while I gave a little from much.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu al-Yaqzan narrated from Juwayriba who said: Nusayb came to Abdullah bin Ja'far. He gave him mounts, gifts, and clothes. A sayer said to him: 'O Ibn Ja'far, you gave this black slave these gifts?' He said: 'By Allah, if this one is black, his praise is white. His poetry shakes me. He deserved by what he said more than what he received. What is that? Only mounts that wear out, clothes that fray, and dirhams that perish, while his praise remains and his eulogy is narrated.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Ziyad al-A'jam came to Al-Muhallab bin Abi Sufra in Khurasan and stayed with his son Habib. One evening they sat for a drink. In the house was a tree with a dove on it cooing. Ziyad al-A'jam said:\n'Sing, you are in my protection and covenant... and the covenant of my father, not to be harmed.\nFix your house and do not fear... for hungry small chicks.\nFor whenever you sing a song... you remind me of my loved ones and remind me of my home.\nIf they kill you, I will seek my revenge... by killing them because you are in my protection.'\nHabib took an arrow, shot it, hit it, and it died. Ziyad said to him: 'You killed my neighbor. Between me and you is the Emir Al-Muhallab.' He went to Al-Muhallab and informed him. He said: 'O Habib, pay Abu Umama a thousand dinars.' Habib said: 'May Allah honor the Emir, I was joking.' He said: 'Is there joking with this? Abu Umama's neighbor is my neighbor.' Habib paid him a thousand dinars. Ziyad al-A'jam said:\n'To Allah belongs the eye of one who saw a judgment like... a judgment decreed and executed by Emir Al-Muhallab.\nHe decreed a thousand dinars for a neighbor I protected... from the birds, brooding over eggs, croaking.\nHabib bin Al-Muhallab shot it a shot... and pierced it with the arrow while the sun was setting.\nSo he obliged him the blood-money of the killed with a rebuke... and Habib said: I was only playing.'\nZiyad said:\n'Let not his neighbor be frightened... for the neighbor of my neighbor is like my neighbor and closer.'\nWhen Al-Muhallab heard it, he rewarded him with a good prize and dismissed him honored. This poetry reached Al-Hajjaj. He said: 'The Arabs did not err when they made Al-Muhallab their sheikh.'\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Among the witty stories of Judge Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad is what is told that Al-Mu'tasim was at Al-Jawsaq with his boon companions. He had decided on a morning drink and ordered each of them to cook a pot. He saw Salama, the slave of Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad. He said: \"This is Ibn Abi Du'ad's slave, come to find our news. Any moment he will come and say: 'So-and-so the Hashimite, So-and-so the Qurashi, So-and-so the Ansari, So-and-so the Arab,' and interrupt us with his needs from what we resolved upon. I call you to witness that I will not fulfill a need for him today.\" No sooner had he spoken than Itakh entered asking permission for Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad. He said to his sitters: \"What do you think?\" They said: \"Do not permit him, O Commander of the Faithful.\" He said: \"Evil is this opinion! By Allah, a fever of a year is easier on me than that.\" He permitted him. He entered. No sooner did he greet, sit, and speak, than Al-Mu'tasim's face brightened, and his limbs laughed to him. Then he said: \"O Abu Abdullah, each of these has cooked a pot, and we have made you the judge of the best of them.\" He said: \"Let them be brought so I eat and judge with knowledge.\" Al-Mu'tasim ordered them brought. The pots were presented before him. Judge Ahmad bin Abi Du'ad stepped forward and began eating from the beginning of every pot, a full eating. Al-Mu'tasim said to him: \"This is injustice.\" He said: \"How so?\" He said: \"I see you have indulged in this color (dish), and you will judge for its owner.\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, knowledge of food mixtures is not attained by a morsel or two. I must give each its due in tasting, then judgment occurs after that.\" Al-Mu'tasim smiled and said: \"Your way then.\" He ate from all of them as he mentioned. Then he said: \"As for this one, its owner did well by showing its pepper and reducing its cumin. As for this, its owner excelled by increasing its vinegar and reducing its pepper so its acidity is desired. As for this, its cook mastered it by reducing its water and increasing its syrup.\" He proceeded to describe them one by one until he covered all of them with descriptions that pleased their owners. Al-Mu'tasim ordered the table brought. He ate with the people with the cleanest and best eating. Sometimes he told them stories of the eaters in early Islam like Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan, Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik, Ubaydullah bin Ziyad, and Al-Hajjaj, and sometimes he told them of the eaters of his time like Maysara al-Tarras, Hatim al-Kayyal, and Ishaq al-Hamami.\n\nWhen the tables were lifted, Al-Mu'tasim said to him: \"Do you have a need, O Abu Abdullah?\" He said: \"Yes, O Commander of the Faithful.\" He said: \"Mention it, for our companions want to occupy themselves for the rest of their day.\" He said: \"A man from your family, O Commander of the Faithful, whom time has trampled, changing his condition and roughening his living.\" He said: \"Who is he?\" He said: \"Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik al-Nawfali.\" He said: \"Estimate what fixes him.\" He said: \"Fifty thousand dirhams.\" He said: \"I have ordered it for him.\" He said: \"And another need.\" He said: \"What is it?\" He said: \"Harun's estates to be assigned to him.\" He said: \"I have done it.\" He said: By Allah, he did not leave until he asked for thirteen needs, none of which Al-Mu'tasim rejected. Then he stood up speaking and said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, may Allah grant you long life. By your life, the land of your subjects becomes fertile, their living softens, their wealth grows. May you continue to enjoy safety, protected by honor, with the accidents of time and others repelled from you.\" Then he left. Al-Mu'tasim said: \"This, by Allah, is the one with whom one adorns himself and rejoices in his proximity. Did you not see how he entered? How he ate? How he described the pots? How he was expansive in conversation? How our eating was pleasant with him? By Allah, no one turns this one away from a need except one of mean origin and malicious branch. By Allah, if he asked me in this assembly of mine for the value of ten million dirhams, I would not have turned him away from it, for I know it earns me beauty and praise in the world, and reward and recompense in the Hereafter.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Asma'i said: A war occurred in the desert and connected to Basra. The matter escalated until people walked for peace between the two tribes. They gathered in the Great Mosque. He said: I was sent, while I was \"then\" a boy, to Al-Qa'qa' bin al-Dirar al-Darimi. I asked permission to see him, and he permitted me. I entered and found him in his cloak mixing seeds. I informed him of the people's gathering. He waited until he ate the seeds, then washed the dish and shouted: \"O girl, give us lunch.\" She brought him dates and oil. He said: He invited me to eat with him, so I ate. When he finished his need for eating, he jumped to some clay thrown in the house and washed his hand with it. Then he asked for water and drank it, then wiped the surplus on his face. Then he said: \"Praise be to Allah. Euphrates water, Basra dates, and Levant oil. When will gratitude for this blessing be performed?\" Then he took his robe and wore it over that cloak. Al-Asma'i said: I shrank from him, finding his attire ugly. When he entered the mosque, he prayed two rak'ahs. Then he walked to the people. No waistband remained tied out of reverence for him. Then he sat and bore all the blood money between the tribes from his own wealth. He rose, being the master of all by his virtue.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "It was said to Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan: In Al-Hira there is a man from Jurhum who has age, years, eloquence, and intellect. A long period of his time has passed, and he has seen wonders in his age. Muawiyah said: \"Bring him to me.\" When he attended, he said to him: \"Who is the man?\" He said: \"Ubayd bin Shariya.\" He said: \"Then from whom?\" He said: \"From a people who have no remnant.\" He said: \"How much of your life has passed?\" He said: \"Two hundred and twenty years.\" He said: \"Have the years grieved you?\" He said: \"Yes, O Commander of the Faithful, and death has knocked on me with its doubt.\" He said: \"What have you seen in your years and the length of your life?\" He said: \"I saw a day followed by a day following it, and I saw people passing and not returning. They gather for what perishes from them and do not take lesson from those who passed before them. Time took them every way. Were it not that the newborn is born, the earth would have gone with those on it; and were it not that the living dies, the earth would have been too narrow for those in it.\" Muawiyah said to him: \"Do you have knowledge?\" He said: \"Yes, ask me.\" He said: \"Which wealth did you see as most beneficial and quickest in good to its owner?\" He said: \"A murmuring spring in soft land; it sustains and is not sustained.\" He said: \"Then what?\" He said: \"A mare, with a mare in her belly, followed by a mare.\" He said: \"Where do you stand regarding the reddish camels and the blond Awsiya?\" He said: \"Those, O Commander of the Faithful, are for other than you.\" He said: \"For whom?\" He said: \"For him who manages them with his hand and does not entrust them to another.\" He said: \"Where do you stand regarding gold and silver?\" He said: \"Two stones clashing; if you turn to them they run out, and if you leave them they do not increase.\" Muawiyah said to him: \"Tell me the most amazing thing you saw in your life.\" He said: \"Yes, O Commander of the Faithful. I was in a tribe of the Arabs, and a dead man of theirs named Jabala bin al-Huwayrith had died. I walked in his funeral and joined his group. When he was lowered into his grave and the women wailed after him, a tear overtook me for him which I could not hold back, and I quoted verses I had heard.\" \"Muawiyah said: Say, O brother of Jurhum. So he recited:\n'O heart, you are deceived regarding Asma'... Remember, and will reminding benefit you today?\nYou revealed the love you hide from no one... until galloping horses ran with you.\nYou want a matter, and you do not know if its haste... is better for your soul or what has delay in it.\nSeek provision from Allah from what is in His treasuries... For while there is hardship, eases turn around.\nWhile a man is in the tribes envied... suddenly he becomes in the dust covered by winds.\nThe stranger weeps for him not knowing him... and his relative in the tribe is happy.\nAs if he was nothing but a reminder... and time, wherever it turns, is calamities.'\nWhile I was repeating these verses and two eyes were pouring heavily, unable to hold back their tears, a man beside me from Udhrah said: 'O Abu Abdullah, do you know the speaker of this poetry?' I said: 'No, by Allah.' He said: 'This dead man \"whom we buried\" and you are the stranger weeping for him \"while you do not know him nor know he is the speaker of this poetry\", and his relative whom he mentioned as happy is that one.' He pointed to a man in the group and said: 'By Allah, he cannot hide the happiness he is in due to his loss.'\" Muawiyah said to him: \"O brother of Jurhum, ask what you wish.\" He said: \"Can you return what passed of my life? And push away the term when it comes?\" He said: \"That is not up to me. Ask something else.\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, the world is not yours to return my youth, nor the Hereafter to honor my return. As for wealth, I took 'from it' in my prime what sufficed me.\" He said: \"You must ask me.\" He said: \"Since you refuse, order for me two loaves; I eat lunch with one and dinner with the other. And fear Allah and know that you are leaving what you are in and coming to what you sent forth.\" Muawiyah ordered many loads of wheat and other things for him, but he returned them. He said: \"If you give all Muslims the like of what you gave me, I will take it; otherwise, I have no need for that.\" He bid him farewell and left.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "A witty thing written and appreciated to mention is what the messenger of the King of Khazars narrated while with Al-Fadl bin Sahl about the sister of their king, named Khatun. He said: A year struck us whose flame raged upon us with the heat of calamities and varieties of afflictions. People panicked to the King, and he did not know what to answer them. Khatun said to him: \"O King, prudence is a precious object whose newness does not wear out, and a cause whose dear one is not humiliated. It is the King's guide to reforming his kingdom and his deterrent from corrupting it. Your subjects have panicked to you out of extreme inability to resort to One whose glory is not increased by mistreatment of His creation, nor is His kingdom decreased by returning to them with kindness. No one is more worthy of keeping a testament than the trustee, nor of riding the guidance than the guide, nor of good care than the shepherd. We ceased not to be in a blessing not changed by wrath, and in satisfaction not muddied by anger, until fate ran with what sight was blind to and caution gone from. The gift was taken away, and the Taker is the Giver. Return to Him with thanks for blessings and seek refuge in Him from terrible retributions. Whenever you forget Him, He forgets you. Do not make shame of humbling yourself to the One who honors and humiliates a partner between you and your subjects, deserving a blameworthy outcome. But order them and yourself to turn hearts to acknowledging the essence of His power and humbling tongues in supplication with pure thanks to Him. For a King may punish his slave to return him from something he did to a righteous deed, and to reward him for that thanks for what he gains of another favor.\" He said: The King ordered her to stand among them and warn them with this speech. She did. \"They received her preaching with acceptance and returned from the door of the lower king to the door of the Highest King. Allah knew from them the acceptance of preaching, command, and prohibition. A year passed over them, and not one of them was in need of a blessing he was on, and increases of beautiful making followed upon them. To Allah belongs praise and thanks.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu Bakr \"al-Hudhali\" said: Abd al-Rahman, the nephew of Al-Asma'i, told us from his uncle Abd al-Malik al-Asma'i who said: A delegation came to Hisham bin Abd al-Malik. Among them was a man from Quraysh called Ismail bin Abi al-Jahm. He was the eldest of them in age and the best in opinion and wisdom. He stood leaning on a staff and said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, the orators of Quraysh have spoken and elaborated and praised you and done well. By Allah, their speaker did not reach your worth, nor did their praiser count your virtue. Do you permit me to speak?\" He said: \"Speak.\" He said: \"Shall I be brief or elaborate?\" He said: \"Rather, be brief.\" He said: \"May Allah guard you, O Commander of the Faithful, with good, adorn you with piety, and combine for you the Hereafter and the First (life). I have needs; shall I mention them?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"My age has increased, my strength has weakened, and my need has intensified. If the Commander of the Faithful sees fit to mend my break and negate my poverty, let him do so.\" Hisham said: \"O Ibn al-Jahm, what mends your break and negates your poverty?\" He said: \"A thousand dinars, and a thousand dinars, and a thousand dinars.\" He said: \"Far from it, O Ibn Abi al-Jahm! The treasury cannot bear this.\" He said: \"It is as if you swore, O Commander of the Faithful, not to fulfill a need for me in this standing of mine.\" Hisham said: \"Then a thousand dinars for what?\" He said: \"To pay a debt that has bent my back and burdened me.\" He said: \"Excellent paths you took: a debt you paid and a trust you fulfilled. And a thousand dinars for what?\" He said: \"To marry off those of my children who have reached maturity, strengthening my arm with them and increasing my number.\" He said: \"No harm; you lowered a gaze, fortified a chastity, and increased offspring. And a thousand dinars for what?\" He said: \"To buy land with it, returning its surplus to my children and the surplus of its surplus to my relatives.\" He said: \"And no harm; you wanted a store, hoped for a reward, and joined ties of kinship. We have ordered it for you.\" He said: \"Praised be Allah for that, and may Allah reward you, O Commander of the Faithful, and the womb (kinship) with good.\" Hisham said: \"By Allah, I have never seen a man gentler in asking nor kinder in speech than him. Thus should a Qurashi be.\"\n\n**Anecdote:**",

    "text": "Alqama narrated: Al-Fadl bin Ziyad told me: Abu Zayd bin Nawfal told me: I heard Muhriz bin Najiya al-Rusafi say: I was one of those suspected regarding the money of Egypt in the days of Al-Wathiq. The Sultan sought me intensely until Al-Rusafa and other cities became narrow for me. I went out wanting the desert, seeking a man of mighty protection and impregnable house to seek refuge with and stay with. I ended up at Banu Shayban. A house overlooking the back of a fortified hill was raised for me. In its courtyard was a tied horse and a planted spear, its head shining, and under it a great suit of armor. I approached, dismounted the horse, advanced, and greeted the people of the house. Women returned my greeting from behind the curtain. Then they advanced and lifted the gaps of the curtains with eyes like the eyes of young gazelles. One of them spoke and said: \"Rest assured, O urban dweller, for excellent is the camel-place of the friend you have made kneel at.\" I said: \"How can the sought one be safe and the desired one be safe without seeking shelter in a mountain that protects him or a stronghold that defends him? Rarely does the one sought by the Sultan sleep while fear overcomes him.\" She said: \"O urban dweller, your tongue has interpreted a great sin and a small heart. By Allah, you have settled in the courtyard of a house where no one is wronged, and no liver goes hungry, as long as this tribe has a support. This is the house of Al-Aswad bin Qannan. His maternal uncles are Al-Araqim, and his paternal uncles are Shayban. The pauper of the tribe in his wealth, and their master in his deeds. He has protection, the lighting of fire, and the seeking of revenge; he is not disputed nor fought. Amama bint al-Jalah al-Kalbiyya described him saying:\n'If you wish to meet a youth whom if you weighed... against every Ma'addi and every Yamani,\nHe would outweigh them in clemency, generosity, sovereignty... and bravery; this is Al-Aswad bin Qannan.\nA youth like the virgin girl, his face shines... as if the glittering of his face is two moons.\nA noble, the most pious of the sons of Nizar and Ya'rub... and the most trustworthy in contract by word of tongue.\nThe most fulfilling of covenant and longest of hand... and most generous in deed in every place.\nThe most striking with the sword in defense of his neighbor... and the most stabbing in his defense with a spear.\nA youth whose like you will never see in your life... for a day of combat or a day of stabbing.\nAs if gifts and deaths in his palm... are two pouring clouds, heavy with rain.'\nHe said: I said to her: \"The fright has calmed, and the loneliness has stilled. Who will bring him to me?\" She said: \"O girl, call your master.\" The girl went out from the back of the house. She stayed only a little until she came with him in a group from the tribe. I looked at a young boy whose mustache had just turned green and his beard hair appeared, and his side was feared. I stood up and greeted. He returned the greeting, welcomed, and brought me near. He said: \"Which of the benefactors to us are you?\" The woman preceded me and said: \"O Abu Murhaf, this is a man who loved your neighborhood and desired your proximity. His homelands rejected him, his Sultan disturbed him, and his time alienated him. We have guaranteed him from you what the likes of you guarantee for the likes of him.\" He said: \"May Allah moisten your mouth.\" He said: \"Sit.\" I sat, and my hand was in his. He turned his face to the group and said: \"O assembly of my father's sons and my relatives, bear witness that this man is in my protection and covenant. Whoever intends him intends me, and whoever plots against him plots against me.\" Then he ordered a tent pitched for me next to his house and provided me with what I needed. I remained in his protection until Al-Wathiq died, while I was with him in the most pleasant life and most enviable blessings. I departed from him being one of the most grateful people to him.\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Asma'i mentioned: Abu Hanifa the Judge had a neighbor in Kufa who sang. When he returned drunk, he would sing in his room, and Abu Hanifa would hear him and like it. He used to frequently sing this verse of poetry:\n'They wasted me, and what a youth they wasted... for a day of adversity and plugging a breach.'\nThe night patrol met him one night, took him, and he was imprisoned. Abu Hanifa missed his voice that night. He asked about him the next day and was told he was imprisoned. He called for his black robes and tall hat, wore them, and went early to Isa bin Musa and said: \"I have a neighbor whom your patrol took last night and imprisoned, and I have known nothing but good about him.\" Isa bin Musa said: \"Hand over to Abu Hanifa everyone the patrol took tonight.\" So they were all released. When the youth came out, Abu Hanifa called him and said to him secretly: \"Were you not singing, O youth, every night: 'They wasted me, and what a youth they wasted'? Have we wasted you?\" He said: \"No, by Allah, O Judge, but you did well and were generous, may Allah reward you well.\" He said: \"Then return to what you were singing, for I find comfort in it and see no harm in it.\" He said to him: \"I will do so.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** It is said a Bedouin came to Talha asking him and approaching him by kinship. He said: \"This kinship, no one asked me by it before you. I have land for which Uthman gave me three hundred thousand. If you wish, take it; and if you wish, I will sell it to Uthman and pay you the price.\" He chose the land, so he ordered its handover.\n\n**Anecdote:**",

The Caliph said to him: \"How much did the Commander of the Faithful give you?\"—meaning his father (Muawiyah). He said: \"He used to give me, may Allah have mercy on him, one million dirhams.\" Yazid said: \"We have ordered the like for you and added for you, to have mercy on him, one million.\" He said: \"By my father and mother you are, may Allah reward you with good for me.\" He said: \"And for this (prayer), one million.\" He said: \"I will not say it to anyone after you.\" He said: \"And for this, one million.\" He said: \"Nothing prevents me from exaggerating in describing you except fear for you from your generosity.\" He said: \"And for this, one million.\" He carried all the money with him. It was said to him: \"O Commander of the Faithful, you distributed the money of the Muslims to one man.\" He said: \"I only distributed it to the people of Medina collectively.\" Then he appointed someone to know his news without him seeing, who accompanied him. When he entered Medina, he distributed those monies in it until he needed to borrow after a month.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abd al-Malik bin Marwan asked Asma' bin Kharija: \"Traits have reached me about you, so tell me them.\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, they are better from others than from me.\" He said: \"I resolved upon you to tell me them.\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, I never extended my leg before a sitter with me, nor did I make food and invite people to it but that they were more gracious to me by their acceptance than I to them, nor did a man ever set his face to me asking a need but that I considered anything I gave him too little.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Fadl al-Dabbi reported: Ibn al-Mawla came to Yazid bin Hatim al-Muhallabi and praised him with his poem in which he says:\n'O unique one of the Arabs who... has become having no equal.\nIf there were another like you... there would be no poor person in the world.'\nHe called his treasurer and said: \"How much is in the treasury?\" He said: \"In it of silver and gold is the value of twenty thousand dinars.\" He said to him: \"Give it to him.\" Then he said to him: \"O brother, apology to Allah and to you; if I had more than this in my possession, you would not have needed it.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** It is narrated from Laqit who said: Musa Shahawat stood for Yazid bin Khalid bin Yazid bin Muawiyah at his door in Damascus. He was a generous, magnanimous youth. When he rode, he jumped to him, grabbed his beast's rein, and said: \"Stand and shout when you come to Damascus:\n... O Yazid bin Khalid bin Yazid.\nO Yazid bin Khalid, if you answer me... my bird will meet me with the star of happiness.\"\nHe ordered five thousand dirhams and clothes for him and said to him: \"Whenever you wish, call us, for we will answer you.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** It is narrated from Hakam al-Wadi who said: Umar al-Wadi brought me in to Yazid while he was on a donkey, wearing a brocade jubba, brocade cloak, brocade boots, holding a pearl necklace, and having something in his sleeve I didn't know. He said: \"Whoever sings what I desire gets what is in my sleeve, what is on me, what is with me, and what is under me\"—meaning the donkey. They all sang to him, but he was not delighted. Then he said to me: \"Sing, O boy.\" So I sang:\n'Her crown is colors, and her face is enchanting... and her mole is unique, having no neighbors.\nWhen she walks, she sways as if she were a snake.'\nHe was delighted and brought out what was in his sleeve; it was a purse with a thousand dinars. He threw it to me along with the pearl necklace. When he entered, he sent me the donkey and everything on it.\n\n**Anecdote:** Ibrahim bin Khalaf narrated: While Abu Dulaf was walking with his brother Ma'qal bin Isa—they were then in Iraq—they passed a palace. Two slave girls looked out from it. One said to the other: \"Is this Abu Dulaf about whom the poet says:\n'The world is only Abu Dulaf... between his beginner and his attender.\nIf Abu Dulaf turns away... the world turns away on his trail.'\"\nThe other said: \"Is this him? By Allah, I have loved to see him since I heard what was said about him.\" Abu Dulaf turned to Ma'qal and said: \"We have not been fair to Ali bin Jabala nor fulfilled his right, and that is a great concern of mine.\" He had given him a thousand dinars.\n\n**Anecdote:** Ibrahim bin Ahmad narrated: Umayya bin Abi al-Salt came to Mecca to Abdullah bin Jud'an. When he entered upon him, Abdullah said to him: \"A serious matter brought you?\" Umayya said: \"The dogs of my creditors have barked at me and bitten me.\" Abdullah said to him: \"You came to me while I am ailing from debts I incurred. Wait for me a little until what is in my hand gathers. I have guaranteed the payment of your debt and I do not ask about its amount.\" Umayya stayed for days, then came to him and said:\n'Do I mention my need or has... your modesty sufficed me? For your nature is modesty.\nAnd your knowledge of rights, while you are a lord... having refined lineage and praise.\nA generous one whom neither morning... changes from beautiful character nor evening.\nCompeting with the wind in honor and generosity... when the dog is forced into its hole by winter.\nIf a man praises you one day... praise suffices him from exposing himself (asking).\nIf you succeed Abdullah, know... that the people have no reward.\nFor your land is every noble deed built by... Banu Tamim, and you are its sky.'",

If you returned her to him—for the Sheikh needs their service—that would be closer for you with him and more noble than any right he guaranteed for you.\" The speech affected Umayya, and he regretted. He returned to him to give her back. When he came to him with her, Ibn Jud'an said to him: \"Perhaps you only returned her because Quraysh blamed you for taking her and said to you such and such,\" and he described to Umayya what the people said to him. Umayya said: \"By Allah, you have not missed anything of what they said, O Abu Zuhayr.\" Abdullah said: \"So what did you say regarding that?\" Umayya said:\n'Your giving is an ornament to a man if you gift him... He gives, and not every giving adorns.\nIt is not a shame for a man to give his face (ask)... to you, as some asking shames.'\nAbdullah said to him: \"Take the other one.\" He took both of them and went out. When he came to the people with them, he recited:\n'Ibn Jud'an is mentioned with good... whenever the noble are mentioned.\nOne who does not oppress nor disobey... nor do the mean find him stingy.\nHe gives the noble she-camel and the noble horse... The men and the reins are his.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Yazid bin Muawiyah entered upon his father and found him looking down. He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, what is this matter that saddened you?\" He said: \"A matter that has sickened and worried me all day, and I do not know what to do about it.\" He said: \"What is it, O Commander of the Faithful?\" He said: \"This dissolute Abu Dahbal wrote to your sister Atika with these verses:\n'O Atika, will you not, since you were stingy and did not see... for a lover any proximity to you or right,\nReturn a heart that passion has taken over... and calm an eye that does not tire or dry?\nBut you stripped the heart with promise and wish... and I never saw generosity or truth from you a day.\nSo oh my liver! Since I have no sitting with you... to complain of what I suffer from your love and what I meet.\nMy greatest worry is to see a messenger from you... and all day I sit watching the roads.\nI saw you increasing in harshness to the lover... and my heart increasing in love for you every day.'\nShe has not ceased weeping since today; the malicious one has corrupted her. What do you think about him?\" He said: \"By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, the matter regarding him is easy.\" He said: \"What is it?\" He said: \"A slave of yours lies in wait for him in one of the alleys of Mecca and relieves us of him.\"\n\nMuawiyah said: \"Fie on you! By Allah, a man who wishes for you what he wishes and elevates you to what he elevates is without opinion. You have become distressed by a word, and your reach fell short in it, until you wanted to kill a man of Quraysh for it. Do you not know that if you do that, you prove his words true and make us a tale forever?\" He said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, he said another poem which the people of Mecca recite to each other, and it traveled until it reached me, paining me and driving me to what I indicated.\" He said: \"What is it?\" He said:\n'The Mighty King protected meeting her... so before her, perils and killing are feared.\nThere is no good in a love whose consequence is feared... nor in a lover with whom there is no union.\nSo oh my liver! I stayed up with her love... and there was not a moment of giving between us.\nAnd oh wonder! I conceal her love... and it spread until the ways to her were cut.'",

    "text": "Muawiyah said: \"By Allah, you have relieved me. I was not safe from him having reached her. As long as he complains that there was no union or giving between them, the matter is easier for me. Go away from me and conceal what happened.\" Yazid stood up and left. Muawiyah performed Hajj that year. When the days of Hajj ended, he wrote the names of the notables and nobles of Quraysh and wrote the name of Abu Dahbal among them. Then he called them and distributed splendid gifts among all of them and rewarded them with many prizes. When Abu Dahbal received his prize and stood to leave, Muawiyah called him. He said to him: \"O Abu Dahbal, why do I see Abu Khalid Yazid son of the Commander of the Faithful angry with you regarding biting words confirmed from you, and poetry you continue to utter and is sent to our adversaries and clients? Do not cross Abu Khalid.\" Abu Dahbal began apologizing to him and swearing he was lied against. Muawiyah said to him: \"No harm on you, this does not harm you with us. Are you married?\" He said: \"No.\" He said: \"Which of your cousins is dearest to you?\" He said: \"So-and-so.\" He said: \"The Commander of the Faithful has married you to her, paid your dowry of two thousand dinars, and ordered a thousand dinars for you.\" When he received it, he said: \"If the Commander of the Faithful sees fit to forgive me for what passed. If I utter a verse in the meaning of what preceded from me, I have made my blood lawful, and So-and-so whom the Commander of the Faithful married to me is absolutely divorced.\" Muawiyah was pleased with that, guaranteed to please Yazid with him, promised to continue what he gave him every year, and returned to Damascus. Muawiyah did not perform Hajj that year except for the sake of Abu Dahbal.\n\n**Anecdote:** Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, went out patrolling one night in Medina—he used to do that often. He passed by a woman of the Arabs who had locked her door and was saying:\n'This night has grown long and its side black... and it kept me awake that I have no lover to play with.\nBy Allah, were it not for nothing other than Him... the sides of this bed would have shaken.\nAnd I would have spent the night—were it not an innovation—enjoying... a gentle-bellied one whom companions do not contain.\nHe plays with me upon the mattresses and sometimes... he blames me in his love and I blame him.\nBut I fear a Watcher appointed... over our souls whose Watcher does not rest.'\nThen she sighed deeply and said: 'Does Ali bin Abi Talib slight my loneliness in my house and my husband's absence from me?' Umar said: 'May Allah have mercy on you. Where is your husband?' She said to him: 'In such-and-such expedition.' He wrote immediately for his return to her and sent her expenses and clothes.\n\n**Anecdote:** Sulayman bin Abd al-Malik had a muezzin who announced prayer times to him in his palace. A muwallad (mixed-race) slave girl of his came to him and said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, So-and-so the muezzin does not take his eyes off me when I pass by him.\" Sulayman was the most jealous of people. He intended to order (punishment for) the muezzin. Then he said: \"Adorn and perfume yourself and go to him. Say to him: 'Your looking at me has not been hidden from me, and there is more in my heart from you than in your heart from me. If you have a need, I am available for what you want. This Commander of the Faithful is heedless. If you do not hasten, I will never return to you.'\" She went to the muezzin and told him what he said to her. He raised his eyes to the sky and said: \"O Majestic One, where is Your beautiful covering?\" Then he said: \"Go and do not return. Perhaps the meeting will be before the One who does not disappoint expectation.\" She returned to Sulayman and told him the news. He sent for him. When he entered upon Sulayman, the chamberlain said to him: \"The Commander of the Faithful has seen fit to gift you So-and-so and carry to you with her fifty thousand dirhams to spend on her.\" He said: \"Far from it, O Commander of the Faithful! By Allah, I slaughtered my greed for her from the first moment I saw her, and made her a treasure for myself with Allah. I am ashamed to reclaim something I stored with Him.\" Sulayman tried hard to make him take the money and the girl, but he refused. He used to marvel at him and constantly tell his companions his story.\n\n**Anecdote:** It is told about Al-Mamun that he said: I performed Hajj. When I was in Tyre (Sur), I wanted to enter the monastery of the madmen to see who was there. I entered and saw a handsome young man in clean clothes. I greeted him. He said: \"Do you know grammar?\" I said: \"I know of it what fixes my tongue.\" He said: \"Do you narrate poetry?\" I said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Recite to me.\" I recited to him from Abu al-Atahiya:\n'Passion melted my body, flesh, and strength... nothing remained but the spirit and the emaciated body.\nI saw passion as ember of Ghada wood, except that... in every case, it is sweet to its owner.'\nHe fell unconscious. I asked about his story. I learned he was from Banu Tamim; he loved a cousin of his and she loved him. Attempts were made between them until she was taken from him, and they both became obsessed. Here she is in the other monastery. I went until I entered upon her. When she saw me, she sighed deeply then said: \"Indeed, I find the scent of Joseph, were it not that you think me senile.\" She asked me where I came from. I said: \"From the monastery,\" and informed her of the youth's condition. She wept then said:\n'By the One who, if He wished, would not have created separation... If you are absent from my eye, you are not absent from my heart.'",

    "text": "'Longing imagines you to me until it is as if... I converse with you from near while you are not near.'\nHe said: Al-Mamun called and ordered their treatment. They were treated until they recovered. He married the youth to his cousin, assigned them what would improve their condition, and they remained among his entourage until he died.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abdullah bin Tahir was angry with one of his scribes and imprisoned him in a compartment. A slave girl of Abdullah, who was a favorite of his, looked down at him. She looked at the youth—who was cultured—and a look from him met hers. Intense love fell into her heart. She tried to be patient from him but could not. She took a note and wrote in it:\n'O you who commits adultery with his eyes... while in the glance are deaths.\nIf you want a union, then... the tame gazelle has enabled you.'\nThen she lowered the note to him with a string. When he read it, he wrote in it:\n'If you see me looking... with the eyes, then the heart is chaste.\nIt is nothing but the fatal look... while the mind is witty.'\nWhen the girl saw him writing an answer in the note, she rejoiced and had no doubt he was more desirous of her. When she raised the note and read it, his refusal saddened her. She turned it over and wrote on its back:\n'We wanted you to... gaze at a tame gazelle.\nSince you refused, may you... cease not to be an ally to your chains.'\nThen she lowered it. When he read it, he wrote in it:\n'I did not leave the gazelle because I... was harsh to the gazelle.\nBut because I feared a Lord... who ceases not to be kind and compassionate.'\nShe raised the note. When she saw it, that saddened her. She gestured with it to put it in her pocket, but she put it in her clothes without knowing. She entered her compartment. Abdullah came walking on the roof of his palace and passed by the note. He picked it up and recognized the girl's handwriting and the youth's handwriting. He marveled at his chastity and patience from her despite her beauty and loveliness, and she was one of his dearest maids. He entered upon her and found her depressed and sad. He said: \"What is this note, O so-and-so?\" She said: \"May Allah honor the Emir, it is what you saw.\" He said to her: \"Allah is witness over you that he is dearer to you than me.\" She said: \"Yes, by Allah.\" He said: He ordered the youth, his chains were undone, he clothed him, rewarded him, and said to him: \"Take this slave girl with all her possessions as a reward for your chastity, piety, and fear of Allah Almighty.\" He raised his rank among his scribes, and continued to honor him.\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Haytham bin Adi said: Yazid bin Qurra al-Shaybani was fierce and formidable. He held the opinion of the Kharijites and did not fear the governors of Iraq. That enraged Al-Hajjaj and affected him. He wrote to Abd al-Malik informing him. Abd al-Malik wrote to him: \"Use a stratagem for him; if you can overcome him, strike his neck.\" Al-Hajjaj called Yazid bin Ruwaym and Jarir bin Yazid, honored them, brought them close, and said to Yazid: \"You have the police of Iraq,\" and to Jarir: \"The Land Tax Bureau, if you bring me Yazid bin Qurra.\" They rode to him and said to him: \"The Emir is angry with you, and we fear his anger will reach all your family, so ride to him.\" He said: \"I will not do it. If he looks at me, he will kill me.\" They said to him: \"He will not do it, and you must ride with us.\" He came with them prepared for death, and his women came out with him. When he entered upon Al-Hajjaj, he said to him: \"Are you Yazid bin Qurra?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"May Allah kill me if I do not kill you.\" He said: \"I adjure you by Allah not to kill me, for I am the guardian of twenty-four women; there is no man among them other than me, nor do they have a guardian but me.\" He said: \"Who knows that?\" He said: \"They are at the door.\" He ordered them brought in. Each one of them said: \"Kill me and leave him.\" He would say: \"Who are you?\" She would say: \"His paternal aunt,\" or \"maternal aunt,\" or \"daughter,\" or \"brother's daughter,\" or \"sister's daughter,\" until they gathered before him. His sister said:\n'O Hajjaj, gift him today to Allah alone... and to the weeping screaming women, a distress.\nO Hajjaj, either you bestow a favor... upon him, or you kill us together.\nO Hajjaj, how many you will bereave if you kill him... eighteen and two and four.\nO Hajjaj, if you heard the weeping of his women... and his aunts ransoming him all night.'\nAl-Hajjaj pitied her, wept, imprisoned him, and wrote about his matter to Abd al-Malik describing what happened. He wrote to him: \"Pardon him and add his dependents to the stipend.\" So he did.\n\n**Anecdote:** It was said to Abu Aqil the Eloquent: \"How did you see Marwan bin al-Hakam when asking for a need?\" He said: \"I saw his desire to bestow favor above his desire for thanks, and his need to fulfill the need stronger than the need of the owner of the need.\"\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu Dulama met Abu Dulaf in his hunting grounds while he was the governor of Iraq. He took the rein of his horse and recited:\n'I swore that if I saw you safe... in the villages of Iraq and you possessing wealth,\nYou would pray upon the Prophet Muhammad... and fill my lap with dirhams.'\nHe said: \"As for the prayer upon the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. As for the dirhams, no.\" He said to him: \"May I be your ransom, do not separate them, by the One I ask not to separate between you and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him.\" He said: Abu Dulaf borrowed them and they were poured into his lap until they weighed him down.",

    "text": "**Anecdote:** Al-Shaybani said: Ziyad looked at a man from Dabba eating uglily, and he was the ugliest of people in face. He said to him: 'O brother of Dabba, how many are your dependents?' He said: 'Seven daughters, I am more beautiful than them, and they eat more than me.' Ziyad said: 'To Allah is his excellence! How witty is his request. Assign for each of them one hundred and a servant, and hasten their provisions for him and them.' The Dabbi went out saying:\n'If you are seeking generosity and bounty... then hasten to Ziyad or a brother of Ziyad.\nA man answers you giving his money for praise... when every generous one is stingy with kindness.\nWhy should I not praise him when... my path is from his kindness and my inherited wealth.'\n\n**Anecdote:** A man came to Ma'n bin Zaida asking for mounts. He said: 'O boy, give him a horse, a workhorse, a mule, a donkey, and a camel. If I knew a mount other than these, I would give it to you.'\n\n**Anecdote:** A scholar wrote to Yazid bin Hatim asking for a connection. He sent him thirty thousand and wrote to him: 'Now then, I have sent you thirty thousand. I do not increase it out of obligation, nor decrease it out of arrogance. I do not exclude you from praise for it, nor cut off your hope by it. Peace.'\n\n**Anecdote:** While Khalid bin Abdullah al-Qasri was in a tent of his, he looked at a Bedouin trotting his camel towards him. He said to his chamberlain: 'If he arrives, do not answer him.' When he arrived, he brought him in. He greeted and said:\n'May Allah amend you, what is in my hand is little... so I cannot support the dependents as they increased.\nA persistent time threw its chest (weight) upon me... so they sent me to you and waited.'\nKhalid said: 'They sent you and waited? By Allah, I will send you back to them with what pleases them.' He ordered a great reward and noble clothes for him.\n\n**Anecdote:** Abu Ubaidah said: Delegations of Arabs gathered at Al-Nu'man bin al-Mundhir. He brought out two burned (striped/decorated) cloaks to them. He said: 'Let the most honorable of Arabs in tribe stand and wear them.' Amir bin Uhaym al-Sa'di stood up, wrapped one around his waist and threw the other over his shoulder. Al-Nu'man said to him: 'Why are you the most honorable of Arabs?' He said: 'Honor and number among Arabs are in Ma'add, then in Nizar, then in Tamim, then in Ka'b, then in Awf, then in Bahdala. Whoever denies this among the Arabs, let him contest me.' The people were silent. Al-Nu'man said: 'This is your state among your people, so how are you in yourself and your household?' He said: 'I am the father of ten, uncle (paternal) of ten, and uncle (maternal) of ten. As for myself, this is my witness.' Then he placed his foot on the ground and said: 'Whoever removes it from its place gets one hundred camels.' No one stood up to him, so he went with the two cloaks.\n\n**Anecdote:** Al-Qahdhami, Ibn Aisha, and Khalid bin Jamal mentioned that Ibn Abi Atiq went to Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, sons of Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with them, Abdullah bin Ja'far, and a group of Quraysh. He said to them: 'I have a need with a man, and I fear he will reject me in it. I seek your help with your status and wealth against him.' They said to him: 'That is granted to you from us.' They gathered on a day he promised them and went with them to the husband of Lubna. When he saw them, he magnified their coming to him and honored them. They said: 'We have come to you all together for Ibn Abi Atiq's need.' He said: 'It is fulfilled, whatever it may be.' Ibn Abi Atiq said: 'You have fulfilled it whatever it may be, whether family, wealth, or property?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'You gift to them and to me your wife Lubna and divorce her.' He said: 'Then I call you to witness that she is divorced thrice.' The group was ashamed and apologized and said: 'By Allah, we did not know his need. Had we known it was this, we would not have asked you.' Al-Hasan compensated him for that with one hundred thousand dirhams, and Ibn Abi Atiq carried it to him. She remained with him until her waiting period ended, then she asked the people for her father and her husband Qays. She remained with him until he died. Qays praised Ibn Abi Atiq:\n'May the Compassionate reward the best reward... for kindness better than a friend.\nI have tested all my brothers... and I have not found like Ibn Abi Atiq.\nHe strove to gather my union after separation... and a view happened in it from the road.\nHe extinguished a burning in my heart... whose heat choked me with my saliva.'\nIbn Abi Atiq said to him: 'O my beloved, refrain from this praise, for no one hears it but thinks I am a pimp.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Hammad bin Ishaq mentioned: My father told me: I went to Surra Man Ra'a after returning from Hajj. I entered upon Al-Wathiq. He said: 'With what have you gifted me (what's new) of the talk of the Arabs and their poetry?' I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, a young Bedouin sat with me at one of the stops. I saw from him the sweetest youth I have seen in appearance, speech, wit, and manners. I asked him to recite, so he recited to me:\nMay rain water the solitary mountain in whose shades... are two gazelles hidden, united.\nWhenever they wrap around my neck, they communicate... and their glances steal doubts.\nI tried to trick them but could not... and shooting, but they missed me and killed me.'",

    "text": "Then he sighed a sigh I thought cut his intestines. I said: 'What is wrong with you, may my father be your ransom?' He said: 'Behind these two mountains is a grief for me. I have been prevented from passing through these lands, and they have declared my blood lawful. I only enjoy looking at the two mountains as a solace when the pilgrims arrive, then I am prevented from that.' I said to him: 'Increase me from what you said about that.' He recited to me:\n'If I arrive at the water among some of his family... presence, then hint at me as if you are joking.\nIf Hudur asks you about me, tell her... he has changed from his illness and he is well.'\nAl-Wathiq ordered the two poems written down for him. After some days, he called me and said: 'Some old women of our house have composed a melody for one of the poems. Listen to it; if you approve it, we will show it, and if you see room for improvement, correct it.' It was sung to us from behind the curtain. It was of utmost quality—and that is what he used to do if he composed something. I said to him: 'By Allah, its composer has done well, O Commander of the Faithful, masha'Allah.' He said: 'By my life?' I said: 'By your life,' and swore to him by what he trusted. He ordered a rotl (cup) for me, and I drank it. Then he took the lute and sang it three times, gave me three rotls to drink, and ordered thirty thousand dirhams for me. After some days, he called me and said: 'A melody has also been composed here for the other poem.' He ordered it sung. My state with it was like the state with the first. Then he sang it when he approved it, and I swore to him on its quality three times. He gave me three rotls to drink and ordered thirty thousand dirhams for me. Then he said: 'Have I fulfilled the right of your gift?' I said: 'Yes, O Commander of the Faithful. May Allah prolong your survival, complete your blessing, and may your Lord not deprive me of it from you.' Then he said: 'But you did not fulfill the right of your Bedouin companion nor ask me to know him. Your request has preceded regarding him. I wrote about him to the ruler of Hijaz, ordering him to bring him, propose to the woman, and carry her dowry to her people on his behalf from our money.' I kissed his hand and said: 'Precedence to noble deeds belongs to you, and you are more worthy of them than others.'\n\n**Anecdote:** Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan gave permission to the people one day. A young Bedouin stood before him, lowered his veil, and recited:\n'O Muawiyah, O possessor of forbearance, knowledge, and intellect... O possessor of generosity, giving, glory, and virtue.\nI came to you when the path on earth narrowed for me... So by Allah, do not cut off my hope of justice.\nAnd take my right for me from the oppressor who... shot me with an arrow whose easiest part was my killing.\nHe intended to kill me, except that my death... was distant and I had not completed the sustenance of my eating.'\nMuawiyah said: 'What is your matter?' He said: 'May Allah make me your ransom. I am a man from the people of Basra. I married a cousin of mine. I was in love with her, and she admired me. Words passed between me and her father like what passes between in-laws, so he withheld her from me. That took from me what only Allah knows. I went to your governor Ibn Umm al-Hakam and complained to him some of what I find. He pitied me and sent for her and her father. They were brought. When he looked at her, she pleased him. He ordered me imprisoned without hearing from her or her father. Then he sent to me to divorce her, but I refused. He tortured me with types of torture. When I feared death, I divorced her. O relief of the distressed, is there a trick? For sadness has stunned me and worry kept me awake.' Muawiyah said: 'By Allah, I have never seen a day like today.' Then he called for inkwell and paper and said: 'Write to him, O boy, and emphasize to him to send her by a deadline.' He wrote at the bottom of the letter:\n'I give my God a covenant I will not break... and I absolve myself today from my religion and faith.\nIf you oppose me in what I wrote... I will make you meat between my eagles.'\nThe messengers carried the letter, set off, and entered upon him. When he read it, he sighed deeply, re-read it, sighed deeply, then said: 'I wish Muawiyah had left her with me for a year then offered me to the sword.' He ordered her prepared, ordered thirty thousand dirhams for the messengers, and said: 'If Muawiyah gives you a choice, choose me.' She said: 'I say what Allah makes run on my tongue.' He wrote a letter to Muawiyah saying at its bottom:\n'Do not break your oath, O Commander of the Faithful, for... I fulfilled your vow with gentleness and possibility.\nI have brought a face that has no like... in what people see of jinn and men.\nSo excuse, for if you saw her image... you would say: What is this? A statue of a human?'\nThe messengers left and arrived at Muawiyah while the Udhri (Bedouin) was staying. When Muawiyah looked at her, she pleased him. He said to the Bedouin: 'Woe to you! Is there patience from her with great compensation for her?' He said: 'No, by Allah, even if my body and head were separated.' He recited:\n'Do not make me, while proverbs are struck by me... like one seeking refuge from the scorching ground in the fire.\nBy Allah, by Allah, I will never leave her... until I am pillowed in dust and stones.'",

She grabbed the Bedouin's hand and said:\n'This one, even if he is in my rags... is more honorable to me than my father and neighbor.\nAnd the owner of dirham and dinar... and command and prohibition with greatness.\nI fear, if I did, the heat of the Fire.'\nMuawiyah ordered her to wait out her period.

I have appended to that Wondrous Jokes of correct answers, for they are deemed good among sayings as the actions before them are deemed good. Allah is the Guardian of success and prosperity.\n\n**Wondrous Jokes**\n\n**Joke:** Al-Asma'i said: I heard a client of the family of Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, say: Abd al-Malik bin Marwan caught a man who held the view of Shabib the Kharijite. Abd al-Malik said to him: 'Are you not the one saying:\nAnd from us are Suwayd and Al-Batin and Qa'nab... and from us is the Commander of the Faithful, Shabib?'\nThe man said: 'I did not say it like this. Rather I said: And from us is the Commander of the Faithful, Shabib'—putting 'Shabib' in the nominative case (or accusative as vocative, text says nasb on Ra but Shabib ends in Ba, likely meaning grammatical twist). The estimation was: 'And from us, O Commander of the Faithful, is Shabib.' Thus he negated the Caliphate from Shabib the Kharijite on that day—and the news is famous. Abd al-Malik admired his presence of mind and good excuse, so he released him.\n\n**Joke:** A man said to Yazid bin al-Muhallab in a war: 'Why does your sword cut while our swords do not cut, though we pay high prices for them?'
