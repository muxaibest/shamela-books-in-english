They forbade the lawful for them and made the unlawful lawful for them, and they followed them; that is their worship of them.' Reported by Al-Tirmidhi and others, and he classified it as Hasan.

The prohibition of it has been authenticated; Al-Bukhari recorded in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad and Ahmad from Amr bin Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather that a man came to the Prophet ﷺ with a gold ring on his hand. The Prophet ﷺ turned away from him. When the man saw his dislike, he went and threw the ring away, then took an iron ring and wore it, and came to the Prophet ﷺ. He said: \"This is worse; this is the jewelry of the people of the Fire.\" So he returned, threw it away, and wore a silver ring, and the Prophet ﷺ remained silent about it. Its chain is Jayyid Sahih (good authentic).",

And the Hadith of Ibn Abbas from Abu Talhah from the Prophet ﷺ who said: \"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.\" Recorded by him and Ibn Majah; Al-Bukhari added in the second place: \"Meaning the image of statues which have souls.\" Recorded by Muslim and others via another path from Abu Talhah.

Abu Dawood narrated it via Ghassan bin Awf from Al-Jariri from Abu Nadrah from Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ entered the mosque one day and saw a man from the Ansar called Abu Umamah. He said: 'O Abu Umamah, why do I see you sitting in the mosque at a time other than prayer?' He said: 'Worries have adhered to me and debts, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Shall I not teach you words which, if you say them, Allah will remove your worry and pay off your debt?' He said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Say in the morning and evening: O Allah, I seek refuge in You from anxiety and sorrow, and I seek refuge in You from incapacity and laziness, and I seek refuge in You from cowardice and miserliness, and I seek refuge in You from the burden of debt and being overpowered by men.' This chain is weak. Ghassan bin Awf: Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in Al-Taqrib: 'Lenient in Hadith.'

But when we leave the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, we busy ourselves with wives, children, and properties, and we forget much.' Abu Bakr said: 'By Allah, we encounter the same thing.'

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'And what is that?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, we are with you and you remind us of the Fire and Paradise until it is as if we are seeing them with our eyes. But when we leave you, we busy ourselves with wives, children, and properties, and we forget much.'

But O Hanzalah, a time for this and a time for that.' He repeated this phrase - 'a time for this and a time for that' - three times. Authentic.
