    "text": "Introduction: Praise be to Allah who blessed us with the Great Quran, which falsehood cannot approach from before it or from behind it; He made it—the Exalted—a lesson for those who take heed, a sufficiency for those who reflect upon its verses and ponder, and a reminder for whoever has a heart or lends a listening ear while he is heedful. Blessings and peace be upon our Chosen Prophet, and upon his family and goodly companions, and upon the followers who follow them in righteousness and emulate them in every age. To proceed: The sciences of the Islamic religion are the most noble and beneficial of sciences. These sciences are numerous and varied, and the science of Interpretation (Tafsir) is the highest of them in worth and the most elevated in status because it relates to the speech of Allah—the Exalted. Given the importance of the science of Interpretation and its status, many scholars have authored works in this field. Their methods of classification varied, and their interests multiplied. Among these scholars was Shihab al-Din Abu al-Abbas Ahmad bin Yusuf, known as Al-Samin Al-Halabi. He authored his book (Al-Durr Al-Masun fi Ulum Al-Kitab Al-Maknun / The Preserved Pearl in the Sciences of the Hidden Book), focusing therein on the linguistic and grammatical aspects of the Holy Quran. It is considered one of the most prominent references in linguistic interpretation and Quranic parsing (I'rab). He also took care to address Quranic readings, both the authentic and the anomalous. His interpretive and linguistic sources in this book were numerous, yet he did not content himself with merely transmitting from his predecessors; rather, he discusses opinions, weighs them, and provides evidence, all in a distinguished scientific style based on a disciplined methodology.",

    "text": "Among his most prominent sources was the Tafsir of Ibn Atiyyah, which occupies the third rank after the books of Abu Hayyan and Al-Zamakhshari among the sources he quoted from (1). He did not content himself with quoting him; rather, he critiqued him and debated him frequently. He declared this in the introduction of his book, where he said: \"And I mentioned many of the discussions directed at Abu al-Qasim al-Zamakhshari and Abu Muhammad bin Atiyyah\" (2). Most of those discussions were in the field of parsing (I'rab) and readings. Due to their abundance and scientific value, I chose them to be the subject of my Master's thesis research in Quran and its Sciences. I have tracked the places where Al-Samin quoted Ibn Atiyyah and then followed Ibn Atiyyah's statement with a statement of his own, explaining his error and refuting him, or completing a deficiency in his statement, or removing ambiguity from it, or mentioning a meaning more appropriate than Ibn Atiyyah's statement based on a method of weighing evidence. I collected those rectifications (Istidrakat), categorized them according to their subject, arranged them according to the order of the Surahs and verses in the Quran, and then studied those rectifications. * Importance of the Topic and Reasons for Selection: 1 - The method of rectification (Istidrak) is one of the approved methods for explaining and clarifying meanings, and it is among the best methods of response and correction. (3) 2 - The importance of Ibn Atiyyah's interpretation and its superior scientific value led me to choose his statements which Al-Samin critiqued as the subject of research and study. 3 - The distinctiveness of Al-Samin Al-Halabi in his discussions, the precision of his rectifications, and his adherence to a scientific style in responding to those he disagreed with.",

It also took care to mention readings, defend them, and determine their grammatical basis, just as it is considered one of the most prominent references for linguistic interpretation. 6 - The distinctiveness of Al-Samin Al-Halabi's methodology in Quranic parsing; he adheres to the apparent meaning and rejects affectation in parsing. He also relied on the Holy Quran, the Prophetic Hadith, and the speech of the Arabs in his parsing of the Quran, and he paid attention to weighing between different parsings. * Research Objectives: 1 - Clarifying Al-Samin Al-Halabi's stance regarding Ibn Atiyyah's interpretation. 2 - Collecting Al-Samin's rectifications upon Ibn Atiyyah in an independent study. 3 - Studying Al-Samin Al-Halabi's rectifications upon Ibn Atiyyah via a comparative study, and determining the most likely correct view. * Research Boundaries: The rectifications of Al-Samin Al-Halabi in \"Al-Durr Al-Masun\" upon Ibn Atiyyah in Readings, Interpretation, and Quranic parsing, from the beginning of the Quran to its end, collecting and studying them. Excluded by this restriction are: Abu Hayyan's rectifications upon Ibn Atiyyah which Al-Samin quoted from his sheikh textually or with some modification or abbreviation (2). However, rectifications he quoted with an addition of his own to his sheikh's words, such as adding a reason for weakening Ibn Atiyyah's view that his sheikh did not mention, are included in this research.",

The following is a mention of the most prominent of those studies: 1 - \"The Methodology of Al-Samin Al-Halabi in Interpretation in his book Al-Durr Al-Masun\", by Dr. Eissa Al-Duraibi. This is a thesis submitted for a Master's degree in the Department of Quran at the College of Fundamentals of Religion at Imam Muhammad bin Saud University, discussed in 1418 AH. The researcher explained in his thesis that Ibn Atiyyah's interpretation is one of the basic sources Al-Samin Al-Halabi relied upon in \"Al-Durr Al-Masun.\" He discussed the fields in which he quoted him, his method of quoting him, and his stance on what he quotes. He also mentioned that Al-Samin took care to debate the grammarians/parsers and refute them, including Ibn Atiyyah. 2 - \"Selections of Al-Samin Al-Halabi in the book Al-Durr Al-Masun: Study and Evaluation\", by researcher: Muhammad Abdul Samad. This is a thesis submitted for a Master's degree in the Department of Grammar at the College of Arabic Language at Imam Muhammad bin Saud University, discussed in 1417 AH. It is a grammatical and morphological study, and it contains some of Al-Samin's grammatical rectifications upon Ibn Atiyyah. 3 - \"Grammatical Directives for Anomalous Readings in (Al-Durr Al-Masun) by Al-Samin Al-Halabi, Collection and Study\", by researcher: Ibrahim Salem Al-Sa'idi. This is a PhD thesis at the Islamic University, discussed in 1425 AH.",

For example, the rectifier might say: \"And his statement—meaning the statement of the one being rectified—is correct, but the evidence is invalid,\" or \"but the cause he mentioned is not correct,\" or \"is not suitable as a reason for that statement,\" and then he follows up by mentioning the correct evidence or appropriate reasoning. This falls under correcting an error and completing it by stating its evidence or cause.\nThrough the purposes of rectification, we can glean some of the benefits of studying rectifications. Among the most prominent are:\n1 - Knowing the most correct opinions and those most worthy of acceptance in the interpretation of the Book of Allah -the Exalted-.\n2 - These rectifications highlighted the rules of weighting (Tarjih) (2) and contributed to enumerating their facets (3).\n3 - Knowing the causes of error in Interpretation (4), and if those causes are known, they can be avoided (5).",

One of the most prominent ways to know the rules of weighting is tracking and studying the rectifications of exegetes. Among the sources for rules of weighting are books of Tafsir that focused on critiquing opinions and correcting them. See: Qawa'id Al-Tarjih 'ind Al-Mufassirin, by Hussein Al-Harbi (1: 9, 29).\n3. See: Istidrakat Al-Salaf fi Al-Tafsir, by Naif Al-Zahrani (p. 433).\n4. Knowing the causes of error in Tafsir is a fruit of studying rectifications, for rectification is caused by an exegete falling into error. When rectifications are studied, the causes of error become known. The causes of error in Tafsir are many, for example: Lack of knowledge of the Sunnah that explains the verses. An example of this is the opinion of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, regarding the waiting period of the pregnant woman whose husband has died, and the disagreement of Abu Huraira and others with him. See: Sahih Al-Bukhari (6: 155), Book of Tafsir, Chapter: {And for those who are pregnant, their term is until they give birth}, Hadith (4909), and Sahih Muslim (2: 1122), Book of Divorce, Chapter: Expiry of the waiting period of the woman whose husband died and others by giving birth, Hadith (1485).\n5.

I do not mention stories except what the verse cannot be understood without. I affirm the sayings of the scholars regarding meanings, attributed to them according to what the Righteous Predecessors (Salaf Salih), may Allah be pleased with them, received of the Book of Allah... I listed the interpretation in this commentary according to the order of the verse's words in terms of ruling, grammar, language, meaning, or reading...

He pays great attention to grammatical structure, just as he frequently addresses readings and applies different meanings to them (1).

Sheikh al-Islam said: \"The interpretation of Ibn Atiyyah is closer to the Sunnah and the Group (Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah) and safer from innovation than the interpretation of Al-Zamakhshari. Had he mentioned the words of the Predecessors (Salaf) found in the traditional interpretations reported from them as they are, it would have been better and more beautiful. He often leaves what is transmitted from the Predecessors and does not relate it at all, mentioning instead what he claims to be the saying of the investigators (Muhaqqiqin)—meaning by them a faction of the theologians (Ahl al-Kalam) who established their principles using methods similar to those used by the Mu'tazila to establish their principles, even if they are closer to the Sunnah than the Mu'tazila.

Dr. Ahmad Al-Kharrat placed (Al-Muharrar Al-Wajiz) in the second rank among sources Al-Samin quoted from, after the interpretation of Abu Hayyan (1). Meanwhile, Dr. Eissa Al-Duraibi opined that it occupies the third rank after the interpretation (Al-Bahr Al-Muhit) by Abu Hayyan and (Al-Kashshaaf) by Al-Zamakhshari among the sources Al-Samin quoted from (2). After tracking and precise research, I concluded that Ibn Atiyyah's interpretation occupies the third rank among the sources Al-Samin quoted from (3). There is no strangeness in that; for Ibn Atiyyah's interpretation greatly influenced the exegetes after him, and they relied on it due to its distinction in editing opinions.\nAl-Samin said while talking about his method in his book: \"I mentioned many of the discussions directed at Abu al-Qasim al-Zamakhshari, Abu Muhammad bin Atiyyah, and Muhibb al-Din Abu al-Baqa (1), and if it was possible to answer on their behalf with something, I mentioned it.\" (2)",

Even if the grammarians did not explicitly state it, it cannot be rejected; because grammarians usually speak about what relates to expressions/words, but as for meanings understood from the tenor of speech, they usually have no need to speak about them.\" (1)\nSometimes we find him taking the stance of a defender of Ibn Atiyyah's opinions and clarifying them against those who criticize them, especially the author of Al-Bahr Al-Muhit (Abu Hayyan) who objected to Ibn Atiyyah frequently in his book.\nExample: In his discussion on the morphology of the word {Asra' / Faster} in His saying - the Exalted -: {And when We give the people a taste of mercy after adversity has touched them, at once they have a plot against Our verses. Say, \"Allah is faster in plotting\"} [Yunus: 21], he said: \"Ibn Atiyyah (2) made it - I mean Asra' being for preference (comparative) - similar to his saying: 'Indeed it is blacker (Aswad) than tar' (3). The Sheikh (Abu Hayyan) said: 'As for his analogy of \"blacker than tar\" with (Asra') it is corrupt; because (Aswad) does not have a verb on the measure of Af'ala, rather it is on the measure of Fa'ila... Constructing the exclamation or the comparative Af'ala is not prevented by the Basrans from Sawida (became black) and Hamira (became red) except for it being a color'.\" (4) Then Al-Samin said in response to Abu Hayyan: \"His analogy with it is not corrupt, because his intent is the construction of Af'ala from what exceeds three letters even if it is not on the measure of Af'ala. And Sawida, even if it has three [letters], is in the meaning of exceeding three, since it is in the meaning of Iswadda (turned black)... The grammarians explicitly stated that, and they made it the reason preventing the exclamation construction for colors.\" (5)",

So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs 'Umrah - there is no blame upon him for walking between them} [Al-Baqarah: 158]: \"Abu Al-Sammal read (1) (An Yattafa) (2). Its origin is: Yatatawwafu. The Waw moved and what was before it opened, so it was flipped into an Alif and became (Yatatafu). The Taa was assimilated into the Taa after becoming silent, according to the doctrine of those who permit assimilating the second into the first, as came in {Muddakir}. Whoever does not permit that said: The Taa was flipped into a Taa (emphatic T) then the Taa was assimilated into the Taa. There is a point of view (criticism) in this; because the original was assimilated into the augmentative, and that is weak.\" (3)\nAl-Samin said, rectifying him: \"And this which Ibn Atiyyah said contains error from two aspects. First: His claim of assimilating the second into the first, and there is no parallel for that; rather, the first is assimilated into the second. Second: That he said 'as came in {Muddakir}' (4); for it should have been said according to his saying: Mudhdhakir with a pointed Dhal. This is a poor dialect. The good dialect is with the unpointed Dal; because we flipped the Taa of 'Ifti'al' after the pointed Dhal into an unpointed Dal, so two approximants met, so we flipped the first of them to the genus of the second and assimilated.\" (5)",

    "text": "Analysis and Study of the Rectification:\nIbn Atiyyah viewed that the Taa in (Yatatafu) was assimilated into the Taa (emphatic) after becoming silent (Yattafa), meaning he sees the assimilation of the second into the first. Al-Samin opposed him in that and said: The first is assimilated into the second. This is the preponderant view, and it is Abu Hayyan's opinion as well, where he said: \"The Taa (emphatic) was assimilated into the Taa after flipping it into a Taa (emphatic).\" (1)\nThis direction has a weakness according to Ibn Atiyyah where he said: \"Because the original was assimilated into the augmentative, and that is weak.\" This is not weak because the Taa of (Ifta'ala) is flipped into a Taa (emphatic) if preceded by a Taa (emphatic) (2), and that is obligatory (3). After flipping the Taa into a Taa (emphatic), the Taa (emphatic) is assimilated into it (4). The Arabs say in (Yattalibu) for example: Yattalibu; they substituted the Taa with a Taa (emphatic) because it is from its point of articulation, so they assimilated the Taa (emphatic) into the Taa (emphatic), and the assimilation here became obligatory due to its silence (5). The principle in Arab speech is the appearance of the original and not assimilating it into the augmentative, but in such a case they flipped the augmentative into the genus of the original and assimilated it (6).",

Flipping the Taa of Ifti'al to an approximant matching its attribute is obligatory, because if it remained with its proximity to the Taa (emphatic), it would lead either to assimilating it - and it is not assimilated into the Taa because of the Velarization (Itbaq) in the Taa which is lost by assimilation - or to manifesting it, which makes pronunciation difficult due to proximity and conflict in attributes; for the Taa is a plosive (Shadid) and the Taa (emphatic) is fricative/plosive (Rakhw - Note: classical definition varies), and also the Taa is whispered (Mahmus) and the Taa (emphatic) is voiced (Majhur), so they flipped it with the Taa (emphatic) due to its difference in voicing and laxity.

    "text": "Ibn Atiyyah exemplified the assimilation of the second into the first with {Muddakir}, and Al-Samin criticized him for that; because based on his saying, it would be necessary to say (Mudhdhakir) and not (Muddakir), and this is correct. For Ibn Atiyyah sees the assimilation of the second (the Taa) into the first (the Dhal) in (Mudhtakir) becoming (Mudhdhakir), without substitution, like his saying in (Yatatafu): by assimilating the second (the Taa) into the first (the Taa emphatic) becoming (Yattaf). Al-Samin said that (Mudhdhakir) is a poor dialect, and that the good one is with the unpointed Dal (Muddakir), its origin being (Mudhtakir), the Taa of Ifti'al was flipped into a Dal after the Dhal (Mudhdakir), so two approximants met, so the first of them (the Dhal) was flipped to the genus of the second (the Dal), and the Dal was assimilated into the Dal.\nThe correct view is that (Mudhdhakir) is not a poor dialect, but rather uncommon. The Taa of Ifti'al is flipped with the Dhal into a Dal obligatorily, like their saying in (Mudhtakir): (Mudhdakir). It is permissible in it, after flipping the Taa, to have two flips. One of them: Flipping the Dhal into a Dal (Muddakir) and assimilating it into the Dal that follows it, so they become in pronunciation a single doubled Dal (Muddakir). This is the condition of assimilation, because they flip the first letter to the genus of the second then assimilate it into it (1). Flipping the first to the genus of the second was permitted because the first is original and the second is augmentative, so they disliked assimilating the original into the augmentative, so they flipped the augmentative to the genus of the original and assimilated it.\nThe second aspect: That the Dal is flipped into a Dhal (Mudhdhakir) and assimilated, so the pronunciation becomes a pointed Dhal (Mudhdhakir) (2).

This is regressive assimilation (note: text implies second into first, which usually means the first dominates, but 'progressive'/'regressive' terms can vary in translation contexts - here the text describes the outcome matching the first). (2)\nSummary of the Rectification Study:\n• Assimilating the first into the second is the common practice.\n• (Mudhdhakir) is a dialect narrated from some Arabs but it is rare, and it has its direction.\n• Assimilating the original into the augmentative is disliked in the language, except that it occurs in examples like those mentioned, where they flipped the augmentative to the genus of the original and assimilated it.\n* * *",

They only claimed the invalidity of this reading because, to them, it is from the roots with a Waw, which is Al-Tawq, so from where does the Yaa come? This reading is neither invalid nor weak, and it has a good extraction: That this reading is not from the form (Tafa'ala) such that the problem they mentioned would be necessary, but rather it is from (Tafay'ala), and the origin is: (Tataywaqa) from Al-Tawq, like (Tadayyara) and (Tahayyara) from Al-Dawaran (Rotation) and Al-Hawr, and the origin is: (Tadaywara) and (Tahaywara). So the Yaa and Waw met, and one of them was preceded by silence (Sukoon), so the Waw was flipped into a Yaa, and the Yaa was assimilated into the Yaa. So the origin was: Yatataywaqunahu, then it was assimilated after the flip. So whoever read it (Yattayyaqunahu) with Fatha on the Yaa built it for the active voice, and whoever added Damma built it for the passive voice.

Ibn Atiyyah's saying: 'And that is not necessitated by the principles' is not accepted from him; for if the transmission is authentic, it is not opposed by analogy.\" (3)\nStudy of the Rectification:\nIn Ibn Atiyyah's statement and Al-Samin's rectification of it are several issues:\nThe First Issue: Regarding Abu Amr's Reading:\nAbu Amr read in the case of two identical letters from two words by assimilating the first into the second of them, whether what was before it was silent or moving. So he would assimilate the Ra into its like, whether what was before it moved or was silent, in all its parsings wherever it occurred (4).",

    "text": "Some of them said: What was narrated from Abu Amr is not true assimilation (Idgham), rather it is hiding (Ikhfa') the first of the two identical letters, a hiding that resembles assimilation. They interpreted what occurred in the expression of the early scholars as 'Idgham' metaphorically; by applying the name of Idgham to Ikhfa', because Ikhfa' is close to it (1).\nImam Ibn Al-Jazari (2) said: \"And it differed regarding Abu Amr. The Maghribis (Westerners) entirely narrated Ikhfa' from him—meaning Ikhtilas (stealing/hurrying the vowel)—to flee from combining two silent letters. The Iraqis and Mashriqis (Easterners) entirely narrated Sukoon (Idgham) from him, and they do not mind the combining of two silent letters due to its validity in narration and its occurrence in language... The Kufan grammarians recounted hearing from the Arabs: Shahru Ramadana: assimilated.\" Then he said: \"Both aspects are correct, except that the text from them is for Sukoon (Idgham), and Ikhtilas is not known except from the paths of the Maghribis and those who followed them.\" (3)\nThe Second Issue: Regarding the reason for Ibn Atiyyah's criticism of the reading:\nIbn Atiyyah criticized this reading for its contradiction to what was established by the majority of Basrans. Among those who also criticized it was Abu Ja'far Al-Nahhas, where he said: \"Abu Amr assimilated the Ra into the Ra, and this is not permissible lest two silent letters meet.\" (4)",

    "text": "The doctrine of the majority of Basrans regarding two identical letters from two words is: The permissibility of assimilation in two identical letters from two words with two conditions: That they are not two Hamzas, and that the letter before them is not a silent letter that is not a letter of softness (Lenis/Vowel), like {Shahr Ramadan}, for this is not permissible to assimilate according to the majority of Basrans. For what is before the Ra here (the Ha) is a sound silent letter, and the assimilated letter is silent; and combining two silent letters in connection (Wasl) where the first is not a vowel letter is not permissible according to them (1).\nThe Third Issue: Al-Samin Al-Halabi's defense of the Reading:\nAl-Samin Al-Halabi defended Abu Amr's reading and replied to Ibn Atiyyah saying: \"And his saying 'And that is not necessitated by the principles' is not accepted from him; for if the transmission is authentic, it is not opposed by analogy\" (2). Al-Samin Al-Halabi adhered to the traditional (Athari) method in his defense of authentic readings and his response to those who criticized them. So whenever a reading is authentic, no attention is paid to those who criticize it for contradicting their grammatical analogy. What Al-Samin mentioned is a rule in authentic readings; if the reading is established and its transmission is authentic, it must be followed; because it is a followed Sunnah that must be adhered to and resorted to, even if it contradicts linguistic analogies and grammatical rules. Abu Hayyan said in his defense of this reading: \"The language of the Arabs is not limited to what the majority of Basrans transmitted, nor to what they chose. Rather, if the transmission is authentic, it is obligatory to resort to it.\" (3)",

So it must be accepted, even if the Basrans other than Abu Amr did not permit it, for Abu Amr is a head among the Basrans (1). Ibn Al-Hajib (2) said after quoting the conflict between the sayings of the Reciters and the Grammarians: \"It is more appropriate to refute the Grammarians in forbidding the permissibility, for their saying is not a proof except upon consensus. And among the Reciters is a group of the greatest Grammarians; so the consensus of the Grammarians is not a proof given the Reciters' disagreement with them. Then, even if we assume that the Reciters do not include a Grammarian, they are transmitters of this language, and they share with the Grammarians in transmitting the language, so the consensus of the Grammarians is not a proof without them. If that is established, resorting to the saying of the Reciters is more appropriate; because they are its transmitters from those whose infallibility from error in such matters is established; and because the Reading is established as concurrent (Mutawatir) while what the Grammarians transmitted is singular (Ahad). Then if we concede that it is not concurrent, the Reciters are more just and more numerous, so returning to them is more appropriate.\" (3)",

    "text": "Al-Dumyati (1) said: \"There is no difference between a silent letter due to a pause (Waqf) and a silent letter for assimilation (Idgham). Their claim regarding the impermissibility of the mentioned assimilation in connection (Wasl) is prohibited, and not finding a thing does not indicate its non-existence in reality. Indeed, the meeting of two silent letters has been heard from the most eloquent of Arabs, nay the most eloquent of creation absolutely, peace be upon him, in what is narrated: (Ni'imma (2) bil-mal al-salih lil-rajul al-salih) (3). This has been concurrently transmitted (Mutawatir) from the Reciters, and it spread and circulated and was not denied, and this is an affirmation beneficial for knowledge. What they mentioned is a negation based on conjecture, so scientific affirmation takes precedence over conjectural negation. Even if we concede that it is not Mutawatir, the least of the matter is that it is established as a dialect by the indication of the transmission of trustworthy narrators for it from those who are more eloquent than those whose speech they used as evidence. Thus, the preponderance remains with affirmation, and it takes precedence over negation.\" (4)\nSo the correct view in this issue is: That the Quran is an authority over the language, not that the language is an authority over the Quran. As long as the reading combining two silent letters where the first is not a soft letter (Lin) has been narrated via a path whose authenticity is definitive, then it is what must be resorted to and upon which rules should be based (5).

The meaning: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, used to forbid Quraysh from worshipping angels, and the Jews and Christians from worshipping Uzair and the Messiah. When they said to him: Shall we take you as a lord? It was said to them: It was not for a human that Allah chooses him as a prophet, then he orders people to worship him, and forbids you from worshipping angels and prophets.\" (1)\nSecond: Reason for Ibn Atiyyah's faulting of Al-Tabari's direction:\nAbu Hayyan said: \"The aspect of error is that if it is conjoined to {Yaqula}, (La) would be for establishing negation. It is only possible to estimate the operator before (La), which is (An); so a negated verbal noun (Masdar) is molded from (An) and the negated verb. The meaning becomes: It was not for a human described by what he was described with that his ordering to take angels and prophets as lords be negated. And if negation is not for him, then affirmation is for him, so he becomes ordering to take them as lords, and this is an error. If you make (La) for emphasizing the previous negation, the negation applies to both estimated verbal nouns (Masdars) whose affirmation is estimated, so His saying: Be servants to me, and his ordering to take angels and prophets as lords, are negated. This meaning is clarified by placing (Ghayr) in place of (La). If you said: Zaid has no Fiqh nor (La) Grammar; (La) would be for emphasizing negation and both descriptions are negated from him. If you made (La) for establishing negation it would be in the meaning of Ghayr (other than), so the meaning becomes the negation of Fiqh from him and the affirmation of Grammar for him. For if you said: Zaid has no Fiqh and other than (Ghayr) Grammar; that would entail affirming Grammar for him, as if you said: He has nothing other than Grammar. Do you not see that if you said: I came with no (bi-la) provision; the meaning is: I came without (bi-ghayr) provision. And if you said: I did not come without (bi-ghayr) provision, its meaning is: that you came with provision; because (La) here is for establishing negation. So Ibn Atiyyah's absolute declaration of error and lack of coherence of meaning is only on one of the two estimations: that (La) be",

This is strange; after making it from the category of transferring the Hamza's vowel, how does he return to say: one of the two Waws was deleted? It is possible to extract Al-Hasan's reading on two other aspects. First: That the Damma (vowel 'u') was deemed heavy on the Waw because it is its sister, so it was as if three Waws gathered. Thus, the Damma was transferred to the Lam, so two silent letters met: the Waw which is the 'Ayn (middle radical) of the word, and the Waw which is the pronoun. So the first was deleted due to the meeting of two silent letters. Had Ibn Atiyyah said this, it would have been more appropriate.

Some scholars went to the view that their saying: \"I ask you by Allah and by the womb\" does not fall under swearing by other than Allah, but rather it is an appeal to another by the right of the womb, so there is no prohibition in it. Others went to the view that this is a recount of what they were upon in the Days of Ignorance (Jahiliyyah), so He urged them to join the womb and forbade them from severing it, and alerted them that it reached such sanctity with them that they would ask by it, then the Law did not affirm that asking for them but forbade them from it, while its sanctity remains and joining it is required and severing it is forbidden.

Some scholars transmitted this reading without direction, and some directed it grammatically. They have four opinions in directing it:\n1 - That his saying: (Rusulun) is an inceptive (Mubtada) raised by the return of the mention, and what is after it is its predicate. The return of the mention is his saying: (Qad qasasnahum). This was said by: Al-Farra (3), Al-Tabari (4), Abu Hayyan (5), and Al-Samin Al-Halabi (6).",

Al-Tabari said: 'Based on this, {Wa Muhayminan} would be a circumstantial accusative (Hal) from the Kaf in {Ilayka}' (2). He (Al-Tabari) challenged this opinion due to the presence of the Waw in {Wa Muhayminan}; because it is a conjunction to {Musaddiqan}, and {Musaddiqan} is a Hal from the Book, not a Hal from the Kaf; for if it were a Hal from it, the construction would be: Lima bayna yadayka (what is before you); with a Kaf.\" Then Al-Samin said: \"Ibn Atiyyah said here after recounting Mujahid's reading and his interpretation that Muhammad, peace be upon him, is a trustee over the Quran: 'Al-Tabari said: And his saying (Muhaymanan) based on this is a Hal from the Kaf in his saying {Ilayka}.

However, Mujahid reads with Fatha on the second Mim, and if that is so, then what Mujahid said regarding the meaning of (Muhaymanan) is correct and cannot be rejected (1).\nFourth: Al-Samin's agreement with Al-Tabari and his refutation of Ibn Atiyyah:\nAl-Samin did not agree with Ibn Atiyyah in his objection to Al-Tabari; he went to support Al-Tabari in his objection to Mujahid where he said: \"What Abu Muhammad said does not contain a refutation of Al-Tabari, for Al-Tabari found the existence of (Muhaymanan) as a Hal from the Kaf to be problematic on Mujahid's reading.

The principle is that when an exegete mentions the meanings of the Quran, he mentions them based on the known concurrent reading, not on the anomalous one (3).",

First: That this adverb was expanded, so the verb was assigned to it, thus becoming a noun like other declinable nouns.\" (1) Al-Samin spoke at length about this aspect, then mentioned the second aspect saying: \"Second: That (Bayn) is a noun, not an adverb, and its meaning is 'Connection' (Al-Wasl), i.e., Your connection has been severed. People have two expressions regarding this implying that (Bayn) is the verbal noun (Masdar) of 'Bana Yabinu Baynan' meaning he became distant, so it is from the auto-antonyms (Addad), i.e., it is shared by verbal homonymy; used for connection and separation. This is attributed to Abu Amr (2), Ibn Jinni (3), Al-Mahdawi (4), and Al-Zahrawi (5). Abu Ubaid (6) said: Abu Amr used to say: The meaning of 'Taqatta'a Baynukum' is: Your connection was severed, so it became a noun here without having (Ma) with it (7). Al-Zajjaj said: 'And Raf' is better, and its meaning is: Your connection has been severed' (8). So these scholars stated generally that (Bayn) is in the meaning of connection, and the principle in general statements is literal meaning (Haqiqah). However, Ibn Atiyyah challenged it, and claimed that (Al-Bayn) meaning connection was not heard from the Arabs, and that it was only extracted from this verse, or that",

I (Al-Samin) say: The apparent meaning of Ibn Atiyyah's speech implies that he understood it to mean connection literally/really, then rejected it because it was not heard from the Arabs. This is unsatisfactory from him, because Abu Amr, Abu Ubaid, Ibn Jinni, Al-Zahrawi, Al-Mahdawi, and Al-Zajjaj are Imams whose word is accepted. His saying: 'It was only extracted from the verse' is prohibited; rather, that is understood from the language of the Arabs. Even if no one transmitted it except Abu Amr, he would be sufficient. His expression implies that it is a metaphor. The face of the metaphor, as Al-Farisi said: 'When (Bayn) was used with two joined things in the likes of: Between me and you is a partnership, and between me and you is kinship and friendship; it became, due to its usage in these places, in the meaning of connection (Waslah), and contrary to separation. Therefore it came: Your connection was severed.' (1) If this is established, the opinion that it is a metaphor is more appropriate than the opinion that it is a homonym, because when homonymy and metaphor conflict, metaphor is better than it according to the majority'. Al-Samin quoted some of what Al-Farisi said in (Al-Hujjah) in his direction of this reading, then moved to the third aspect saying: 'Third: That this is speech carried on its meaning; for the meaning is: Your gathering has dispersed and scattered.

The scholars have four opinions on this issue:\nThe First: That 'Al-Bayn' in (Baynukum) is an adverb used as a noun. When it was used as a noun, it was permissible to assign the verb (Taqatta'a) to it. It is not permissible for (Baynukum) to be a verbal noun (Masdar); because the estimation would become: Your separation has been severed, and this is contrary to the intended meaning; because the intent is: Your connection has been severed. It is permissible for 'Al-Bayn' to mean connection although its origin is separation; because when it was used with two joined things in the likes of: Between me and him is a partnership, and between me and him is friendship; it became, due to its usage in these places, in the status of connection (Waslah) contrary to separation; therefore {Laqad Taqatta'a Baynukum} came meaning: Your connection has been severed.

Whoever permitted that did not weaken the reading, and whoever prevented that weakened the reading and rejected it.\nFrom a grammatical perspective, the Kufans permitted separation between the annexed and annexed to with the adverb and prepositional phrase and others in poetry and prose alike.

Even if the Arabs did not use such separation, analogy would require its use; because they separated in poetry with the foreign extensively; so separating with a non-foreign element deserved to have merit, so it is judged permissible absolutely (3).\nIbn Hisham - who is a Basran - clarified the issues where separation is permitted in prose, mentioning one of them: That the annexed be a verbal noun and the annexed to be its agent, and the separator be either its object; like Ibn Amir's reading, or its adverb; like the saying of some: \"Tarku yawman nafsika wa hawaha\".\nThe second: That the annexed be a description (Wasf), and the annexed to be its first object, and the separator be its second object; like the reading of some: {Fa la tahsabanna Allaha mukhlifa wa'daha rusulihi} [Ibrahim: 47].",

The people in Damascus and all the lands of Sham up to Al-Jazirah Al-Furatiyyah (3) and its districts used only Ibn Amir's reading, and the matter remained so until around the year 500.

    "text": "First: The meaning of the reading (Narta'i):\nThe reading affirming the Ya in (Narta'i) is like the other correct reading with Kasra on the 'Ayn: (Narti'); its origin is: Narta'i, but the Ya was deleted for the jussive case (1). (Narta'i) is 'Ifti'al' from grazing (Al-Ra'y), on the measure: Nafta'il, i.e., we graze livestock (2). It was said: The meaning of (Narta'i) is we guard each other and preserve one another, so it is 'Ifti'al' from guardianship (Al-Ri'ayah) meaning: preservation (3). This meaning is supported by what came from Mujahid in interpreting the verse: (Narta'i) i.e., we guard one another (4). Ibn Qutaybah said: \"Whoever read: (Narti') with Kasra on the 'Ayn meant: We guard and tend to each other, i.e., preserve. From it is said: Ra'ak Allah (May Allah tend to you); i.e., preserve you.\" (5) Ibn Khalawayh said: \"The argument for whoever broke it (Kasra) is that he took it from Al-Ra'y, and its origin is affirming the Ya in it, so he deleted it to indicate the jussive; because it is the response to the request in their saying: {Arsilhu ma'ana}.\" (6)",

Ibn Atiyyah weakened this reading from this aspect, for that, according to him, is not permissible except in poetry (2). The correct view is that this reading is linguistically correct. Affirming the weak letter at the end of the jussive present tense verb, and making it jussive with an estimated Sukoon on the weak letter before the arrival of the jussive article, is a dialect of some Arabs (3), and it is correct and not a matter of necessity at all (4). Al-Azhari (5) said: \"The silent Ya is left as it is in the place of jussive in some dialects.\" (6) Ibn Khalawayh said: \"Some Arabs treat the weak verb like the sound verb, so they say: Lam ya'ti (with Ya) Zaidun.\" (7)",

    "text": "Several scholars refuted this declaration of error and validated this narration linguistically, including: Abu Hayyan (1), Al-Samin (2), and Al-Shihab Al-Khafaji (3). Its justification in language: That it is permissible for the condition and consequence to be followed by a present tense verb in accusative (Nasb) by estimating (An) after the Fa, like the reading of whoever read: {And if you disclose what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive (Fayaghfira)} [Al-Baqarah: 284] with Nasb of: (Fayaghfira); by estimating (An) after the Fa. There is no difference in that whether the conditional particle is jussive or non-jussive (4).\nSo Al-Samin Al-Halabi replied to Ibn Atiyyah with this justification, which is correct in Arabic. However, it cannot be asserted that Ibn Atiyyah's declaration of error was from the linguistic aspect; perhaps he intended that it is an error from the aspect of narration (Riwayah), which is more apparent; since he said: \"And it is a mistake by Hubayrah\" (5), and he did not address the grammar or deny the opening of the Ya linguistically. It was Al-Farisi who declared it incorrect both narrationally and linguistically. As for Ibn Atiyyah's declaration of error, it allows both possibilities. If his declaration of error was from the aspect of narration, this is correct; for it is an anomalous reading and is not authentic from Hafs from Asim. But if the declaration of error was from the linguistic aspect, then Al-Samin's rectification upon him is valid; since this reading has a correct aspect in the language and is not a mistake.\n* * *",

He neither attributes transcription error to those who read or narrated it, nor does he prefer it over a concurrently transmitted reading. Here he rectifies Ibn Atiyyah's saying that the reading with 'Ayn and Nun (Fasta'anahu) is a transcription error not a reading, and he also rectifies Ibn Jabarah's choice of this anomalous reading and his preference of it over the concurrent one. As for Abu Hayyan, he mentioned Ibn Atiyyah's statement and refuted it, denying that this reading is a transcription error; because Ibn Khalawayh transmitted it from Sibawayh, and because Ibn Jabarah transmitted it from Al-Za'farani and Ibn Miqsam. He quoted Ibn Jabarah's statement in which he chose the anomalous reading without criticism or comment (2).\nThe correct view is that the reading with 'Ayn and Nun (Fasta'anahu) is indeed an anomalous reading and not a transcription error as Ibn Atiyyah mistakenly thought, for the following reasons:\n1 - Its narration from more than one reciter, namely: Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Sibawayh, Al-Za'farani, and Ibn Miqsam (3).",

The first: with an elongation (Maddah) on the Hamza (Astaghfarta), i.e.: with a Hamza then an Alif. This reading was weakened by Ibn Atiyyah, and Al-Samin agreed with him in that.

Al-Samin opposed him in that; because deleting the interrogative Hamza before (Am) is permissible in prose and poetry.\nThe subject of this rectification is the ruling on deleting the interrogative Hamza if it occurs before (Am). Scholars have two opinions on this issue:\n1 - The impermissibility of deleting the interrogative Hamza, with the presence of (Am) and without its presence, except in poetry; where it is permissible. This is the opinion of Sibawayh (1), Ibn Jinni (2), and Ibn Atiyyah (3). Ibn Jinni said: \"As for (Istaghfarta) with connection (Wasl), it is at the other extreme of weakness.

Scholars have two main opinions in directing it:\n1 - That (Ma) in this reading is negative (Nafiyah), and based on this the reading is rejected; since its meaning is that Allah did not create evil. Said by: Makki bin Abi Talib (1), Ibn Atiyyah (2), and Al-Shawkani (3). Makki said: \"The famous Reciters and others from the people of anomaly agreed on adding (Sharr) to (Ma khalaqa), and that indicates His creation of evil. Amr bin Ubayd, the head of the Mu'tazilah, separated from the community of Muslims and read: (Min sharrin ma khalaqa) with Tanwin, to establish that there are creators with Allah creating evil, and this is heresy (Ilhad). The correct view is that Allah - Majestic is His mention - informed us that He created evil and commanded us to seek refuge in Him from it.\" (4)\n2 - That (Ma) in this reading cannot be negative; because what follows negation cannot relate to what precedes it. This is the opinion of the majority (5). Then they differed regarding (Ma); some made it infinitival (Masdariyyah) (6), some made it relative (Mawsulah) (7), and some made it an extra particle (Za'idah) (8).",

However, a distinction has been made between them that Al-'Afw may be after punishment so it combines with it, while Al-Ghufran is not with punishment.\" (2)\nStudy of the Rectification:\nScholars went to the view that Al-'Afw in the language is applied to erasure (Mahw) (3), leaving (Tark) (4), and facilitation (Tashil) (5). None of the scholars said that Al-'Afw applies to covering and veiling; rather they mention veiling in the meaning of Al-Ghufran. Ibn Atiyyah opposed them in that, as he mentioned covering in the meaning of Al-'Afw (6).

This rectification is not in place; for Ibn Atiyyah has the right to prefer the opinion he sees as correct, especially since this issue is not agreed upon among linguists, early or late. Indeed, the majority hold the contrary of what Ru'bah said. The majority also distinguished between Al-Harur and Al-Samum from a temporal perspective, and some distinguished between them from the perspective of intensity; holding that Al-Harur is more intense than Al-Samum (3).",

    "text": "Ibn Hisham explained that this verb is among those that are confusing after the jussive and accusative particles; is it present or past? That is known through context clues. For example, what came in His saying: {But if they turn away (Tawallaw), then say, \"Sufficient for me is Allah\"} [At-Tawbah: 129] is past tense, and what came in His saying: {And if you turn away (Tawallaw), then indeed, I fear for you} [Hud: 3] is present tense (1).\nIbn Ashour said: \"The origin of {Tawallaw} is: Tatawallaw; one of the two Tas was deleted for brevity. It is present tense, and it is the address of Hud - peace be upon him - to his people, which is apparent in running the pronouns on one pattern.\" (2)\nSo the apparent view is that {Tawallaw} is present tense, and the pronoun in it is for the people of Hud and the address is with them, and it is from the completion of the sentences said before that (3).\n* * *\n[2]: Ibn Atiyyah said in his interpretation of His saying - the Exalted -: {And even if We had revealed it to one among the foreigners (Al-A'jamin) (198) And he had recited it to them, they would not have been believers in it (199)} [Ash-Shu'ara]: \"He - Glorious and Exalted - consoled Muhammad, peace be upon him, regarding his people's turning away from",

    "text": "the Law (Shar') by informing that this Arabic Quran, if they heard it from a foreigner (A'jami), i.e.: from a non-speaking animal or from an inanimate object - and (Al-A'jam) is everything that does not speak eloquently - they would not have believed. Meaning: Disbelief has been sealed upon them so there is no way to their belief. And (Al-A'jamun) is the plural of A'jam, which is that which does not speak eloquently even if of Arab lineage; he is called: A'jam. Likewise it is said for animals and inanimate objects.\" (1)\nAl-Samin Al-Halabi said: \"Al-A'jamin is the plural of A'jamiyy with lightening (Takhfif). Were it not for this estimation, it would not be permissible to pluralize it as a sound plural. The reason for preventing its pluralization (as A'jam): It is from the category of Af'al Fa'la' like Ahmar Hamra', and the Basrans do not permit its pluralization as a sound plural except in necessity.\" Then Al-Samin mentioned Ibn Atiyyah's statement - previously mentioned - and followed it with Al-Zamakhshari's statement, where he said: \"And Al-Zamakhshari said: 'Al-A'jam: The one who does not speak eloquently, and in his tongue is foreignness (Ujmah) or impediments to speech (Isti'jam). And Al-A'jamiyy is like it, except that it has the addition of Nisba (attribution) for emphasis'.\" (2)\nThen Al-Samin said: \"Abu Al-Baqa explicitly stated the prevention of (Al-A'jamin) being the plural of A'jam, but rather it is the plural of A'jamiyy lightened from A'jamiyy like Al-Ash'arun; in Al-Ash'ari. He said: '(Al-A'jamin) i.e.: Al-A'jamiyyin; the Ya of Nisba was deleted, just as they said: Al-Ash'arun i.e.: Al-Ash'ariyyun. Its singular is: A'jamiyy. It is not permissible for it to be the plural of A'jam; because its feminine is 'Ajma', and the likes of this is not pluralized as a sound plural'. (3) I say: This has preceded. So in what Ibn Atiyyah said there is a point of view. As for Al-Zamakhshari, there is nothing in his speech indicating it is the plural of A'jam lightened or unlightened, although its apparent meaning is that it is the plural of A'jam without lightening.",

This rectification revolves around the morphology of this word. Ibn Atiyyah went to the view that (Al-A'jamin) is the plural of A'jam. Al-Samin did not agree with him in that; he preferred that it is the plural of A'jamiyy. Scholars have three main opinions on this issue:\n1 - That the word (Al-A'jamin) can be the plural of A'jam, and can be the plural of A'jamiyy. This is the opinion of Al-Farra - as attributed to him - (4). Ibn Ashour justified this by saying that (A'jam) here is a synonym of (A'jamiyy) with the Ya of Nisba; so it is valid in its plural form (A'jamin) to consider that there is no deletion in it considering it the plural of (A'jam), and it is valid to consider the deletion of the Ya of Nisba for lightening, and its origin is: Al-A'jamiyyin (5).\n2 - That it is the plural of (A'jam), which is the one who does not speak eloquently.",

    "text": "While Ibn Atiyyah went to the view that it is for explaining the genus, even though the context of his speech implies that it is for encompassing and generalization, as he said: \"There is no city among the cities but that it is perishing.\" (1) Abu Hayyan said: \"Perhaps his saying: 'for explaining the genus' is from the copyist, and he might have said: for encompassing the genus, do you not see that he said after that: 'And it was said: The intended is specification'.\" (2)\nThe correct view is that (Min) here is the emphatic one (3), which grammarians call: (Extra/Za'idah) (4). It often comes in negation; purifying it for the genus, emphasizing the meaning of generalization in it, i.e.: for encompassing (5). It is not correct for it to be for explaining the genus, for the following reasons:\n1 - That the one for explanation must be preceded by something ambiguous which it explains, and here nothing ambiguous preceded (6).\n2 - That the condition for the explanatory (Min) is that it be preceded by [a noun] adorned with the Generic Al, and that it takes the place of (Alladhi) like His saying: {So avoid the uncleanliness of (Min) idols} [Al-Hajj: 30] (7); because the meaning is: So avoid the uncleanliness which is an idol (8).\n* * *",

Therefore, according to most Basrans, it is a category of the Lam of causation or Lam of 'Kay' (2), while the Kufans made it a category independent of the Lam of causation (3). Even Al-Zamakhshari - who is Basran - made the Lam in His saying - the Exalted -: {And the family of Pharaoh picked him up [out of the river] so that he would become to them an enemy and a [cause of] grief} [Al-Qasas: 8] for causation, and made this causation by way of metaphor not literal reality.

But the meaning of causation in it appears by way of metaphor not literal reality; because their motive for picking him up was not that he be an enemy and a grief for them, but rather: love and adoption. However, since that was the result of their picking him up and its fruit, it was likened to the motive for which the doer does the action.\" (4)\nLinguists distinguished between the Lam of causation and the Lam of consequence saying that in the Lam of causation, the action following it is intended by the doer of the action preceding it, as in His saying - the Exalted -: {And We made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another} [Al-Hujurat: 13] (5).",

They held the permissibility of its addition in negation and affirmation; due to the establishment of hearing (Sama') of that (5).

So you say: 'Ja'a man qama wa qa'adu' (Came he who stood and they sat). The noble verse is likewise; the wording was observed first so it was said: {Man yaqulu}, and the meaning second in {Amanna}. Ibn Atiyyah said: 'That is good because the singular is before the plural in rank. It is not permissible for a speaker to return from a plural wording to a singular. If you said: \"Wa min al-nasi man yaqumuna wa yatakallamu\" it would not be permissible'. End quote. There is a point of view (criticism) in Judge Ibn Atiyyah's statement, because he prevented observing the wording after observing the meaning, and that is permissible, except that observing the wording first is more appropriate. Among what refutes him is the poet's saying:\nI am not of those who shy away (yaku'u) (2) or submit (yastakinuna) (3) ... If the horses of the enemies confront him (kafahathu) (4) (5)\nAnd He said - the Exalted -: {And whoever believes in Allah and does righteousness} [Al-Talaq: 11] until He said: {Khalidina} (abiding eternally) so He observed the meaning, then He said: {Qad ahsana Allahu lahu rizqan} (Allah has made good provision for him) [Al-Talaq: 11] so He observed the wording after observing the meaning. Likewise, he observed the meaning in his saying: (Aw yastakinuna) then observed the wording in (Idha kafahathu).",

So the wording was observed first {Yaqulu}: in singular, then the meaning was observed {Amanna}: in plural. Ibn Atiyyah stated the occurrence of this in the verse, but he did not permit returning from the plural wording to singular, meaning he prevented observing the wording after observing the meaning. Al-Samin rectified him; stating the permissibility of observing the wording after observing the meaning, even if observing the wording first is more appropriate. He cited its occurrence in His saying: ... {And whoever believes in Allah and does righteousness} [Al-Talaq: 11] until He said: ... {Khalidina} so He observed the meaning, then He said: {Qad ahsana Allahu lahu rizqan} [Al-Talaq: 11] so He observed the wording after observing the meaning.

    "text": "Study of the Rectification:\nFirst: Scholars' opinions on the meaning of (Kada) in Negation and Affirmation:\n1 - That its affirmation is affirmation of approximation without the action, and its negation is negation of approximation which entails negation of the action. Said by: Al-Samin Al-Halabi (1), Ibn Hisham (2), Al-Suyuti (3), and others (4). Ibn Hisham said: \"The correct view is that its ruling is the ruling of other verbs in that its negation is negation and its affirmation is affirmation. Its explanation is that its meaning is approximation. There is no doubt that the meaning of Kada yaf'al: He approached the action, and that the meaning of Ma kada yaf'al: He did not approach the action. So its predicate is always negated. As for if it is negated (Ma kada), it is clear; because if the approximation of the action is negated, the occurrence of that action is negated rationally. Its evidence is: {Idha akhraja yadahu lam yakad yaraha} [Al-Nur: 40], and for this reason it was more eloquent than saying: Lam yaraha (He did not see it); because he who did not see might approach seeing. As for if the approximation is affirmed (Kada); it is because reporting the proximity of a thing implies customarily its non-occurrence, otherwise the report then would be of its occurrence not the approximation of its occurrence.\" (5)\n2 - That its affirmation is negation, and its negation is affirmation.",

    "text": "As for the first opinion - which is Al-Samin's opinion - it is objected to by the fact that negating (Kada) does not necessitate negating the action always. Rather, the action might occur as in His saying: {He sips it and can hardly swallow it (Wa la yakadu yusighuhu)} [Ibrahim: 17] while he swallows it (1) against his will after delay (2).\nAs for the second opinion - which is Ibn Atiyyah's opinion - it is objected to by the fact that its negation might be negation not affirmation, as in His saying: {Darknesses, some of them upon others. When one puts out his hand, he can hardly see it (Lam yakad yaraha)} [Al-Nur: 40]. The majority of exegetes hold that he did not see it nor did he approach [seeing it], and some went to the view that this is more eloquent than negating the vision itself (3).\nAl-Tabari has good words on this issue; he clarified what is more apparent from the linguistic perspective, and what is more apparent from the interpretive perspective. He said: \"He might have seen it after slowness and effort, as one says to another: I hardly saw you due to the darkness, while he has seen him, but after despair and hardship. This opinion is the more apparent of the meanings of the word in terms of how Arabs use (Kada) in their speech. The other opinion which we said tends towards meaning he did not see it, is a clearer opinion in terms of interpretation, while it is the more hidden of its meanings. This was only good in this place, I mean saying: 'He can hardly see it' with the intensity of darkness he mentioned; because that is a parable not a report about an event that happened.\" (4)\nAs for the third opinion, none of the scholars preferred it, and most of them turned away from mentioning it.",

    "text": "Perhaps the sixth opinion is the most preponderant of the last three opinions. The detail mentioned by Ibn Al-Qayyim agrees with the meanings in which (Kada) was used in the Quran and the language of the Arabs. Ibn Al-Qayyim said: \"The correct view is that it is a verb implying approximation and has the ruling of other verbs. Negation of the predicate is not derived from its wording and establishment; for it was not established to negate it. Rather, it is derived from the implications of its meaning. For if it implies approximation of the action, it did not happen; so it is negated by necessity. As for if it is used negated, if it is in one sentence it is for negating approximation, as if you say: La yakadu al-battalu yuflihu (The idler hardly succeeds), and La yakadu al-bakhilu yasudu (The miser hardly prevails), and La yakadu al-jabanu yafrahu (The coward hardly rejoices) and the like. If it is in two sentences, it implies the occurrence of the action after it was not approximate as Ibn Malik said. This is the verification of its matter. The intent is that His saying - the Exalted -: {Lam yakad yaraha} [Al-Nur: 40] either indicates that he does not approach seeing it due to the intensity of darkness, which is the more apparent, so if he does not approach seeing it how does he see it? Dhu Al-Rummah said:\nIdha ghayyara al-na'i al-muhibbina lam yakad ... Rasisu al-hawa min hubbi Mayyata yabrahu\ni.e.: It did not approach leaving (Al-Barah) - which is cessation - so how can it cease?\" (1)\n* * *\n[3]: Ibn Atiyyah said in the course of his interpretation of His saying - the Exalted -: {O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as does one who spends his wealth [only] to be seen by the people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. His example is like that of a [large] smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare (Saldan). They are unable [to do] anything (La yaqdiruna 'ala shay'in) with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people}",

Therefore, it was permissible to carry on its wording once in His saying: {Malahu}, {Wa la yu'minu}, {Fa mathaluhu}, and on its meaning another time. This became analogous to His saying: {Ka-mathali alladhi istawqada naran} [Al-Baqarah: 17] then He said: {Dhahaba Allahu bi-nurihim wa tarakahum fi zulumatin la yubsirun} [Al-Baqarah: 17].

It is the habit of Arabs to inform about one of the two things while it applies to both (1). Their rushing was for the sake of Trade primarily, and Diversion was only due to its arrival. He - the Exalted - said after that: {And Allah is the best of providers}, this implies that Trade is the origin, and provision is the fruit of trade, so this was a Quranic clarification for the return of the pronoun to Trade without Diversion (2).\nSecond: The reason for specifying Trade by returning the pronoun to it:\nThe pronoun was returned to Trade because their inclination was towards Trade, and most of their rushing was for it not Diversion; so it was the more important to them. It is the cause of Diversion and Diversion was not its cause. Trade is a stronger cause for rushing away from the Prophet, peace be upon him (3).",

They mentioned several directions for that, including: That (Aw) here is in the meaning of (Waw / And). Others said: The pronoun returns to richness and poverty indicated by the words rich and poor, and the estimation is: Allah is more worthy of the richness of the rich and the poverty of the poor. It was said: The pronoun returns to the two adversaries, the estimation is: If the two adversaries be rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of these two adversaries (2). All of this is affectation that is not needed, and the principle is: Relying on the apparent meaning of the verse without resorting to estimations.\nThe preponderant view: That conjunction with (Aw) allows dualizing the pronoun and singularizing it. The stronger of the two aspects is: Returning the pronoun to one of the conjoined items, and choosing one over the other is based on benefit and importance. The permissibility of dualizing the pronoun is indicated by what came in His saying: {If he be rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of them both} [An-Nisa: 135]; and it is also indicated by the anomalous reading in the verse: (Infaddu ilayhima) (3).

Among those who went to the view that there is an estimated interrogation in it: Al-Sam'ani (1), and Al-Kirmani (2). Al-Samin considered that far-fetched; because it contradicts what the majority of grammarians hold; as they established that it is not permissible to delete the interrogative Hamza without mentioning (Am) after it. Al-Samin Al-Halabi contented himself with weakening this opinion from a grammatical perspective. The summary of the grammarians' opinions on this issue is as follows:\n1 - The majority went to the permissibility of deleting the interrogative Hamza if evidence indicates it, which is: mentioning (Am) after it, so it is inferred by it that there is an estimated interrogation before it (3).",

Rather, this is among their constant attributes that do not change (1). It has been established by evidences that they are described by complete obedience to Allah - the Exalted -, declaring His praise, prostrating to Him, and other acts of worship. Among the evidences for that: His saying - the Exalted -: {They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded} [Al-Tahrim: 6], and His saying: {They exalt [Him] night and day [and] do not slacken} [Al-Anbiya': 20], and His saying: {And the angels exalt [Him] with praise of their Lord} [Ash-Shura: 5]. Furthermore, their saying: {Wa nahnu nusabbihu bi-hamdika} is a nominal sentence, indicating permanence, i.e.: their description inherent to their nature (2), i.e.: We are the ones constant in declaring praise and sanctity.\n3 - The context does not indicate that, and context is relied upon in weighting between possibilities (3). The context here does not indicate that its meaning is: And do we declare praise or do we change, since He said after that: {Indeed, I know that which you do not know}. This indicates that their question was about the wisdom they were ignorant of only, and it is unlikely to be an answer to a question estimated as: Do we declare praise or do we change? The context of the verses in this subject contains affirmation of Allah's knowledge - Glory be to Him - (4), and showing their ignorance (5): {They said, \"Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us.

Ibn Ashour said regarding conjoining a story to a story here: \"It is supported by the fact that marvelous stories indicating the power of Allah - the Exalted - are started with it. Do you not see that it was mentioned in His saying - the Exalted -: {Wa idh qulna lil-mala'ikah isjudu li-Adam} and was not mentioned between them.

It is permissible not to estimate Hal in it, and for it to be a description of a past state.\" (1)\nAl-Samin Al-Halabi said: \"His saying: {Yasumunakum su'a al-'adhab} this sentence is in the place of Nasb as Hal from {Al} (Family/People), in the state of them being afflicters. It is permissible for it to be resumed merely for informing about that, and to be a narration of a past state. Ibn Atiyyah said its meaning, and it is not apparent.\" (2)\nStudy of the Rectification:\nThe majority of the parsers of the Quran went to the view that His saying: {Yasumunakum} is in the place of Nasb as Hal from {Ali Fir'awn} (3), or from the pronoun in {Najjaynakum} (4), or from both of them; because it contains a pronoun for each of them (5).",

So Al-Samin's rectification upon Ibn Atiyyah is valid, because deleting the annexed noun understood from the context is common in Arab speech (3), but in parsing and interpretation this annexed noun should be clarified. An example of deleting the annexed noun in the Quran is what came in His saying - the Exalted -: {Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel after Moses} [Al-Baqarah: 246] i.e.: after the death of Moses peace be upon him (4).\n* * *\n[7]: Ibn Atiyyah said in the course of his interpretation of His saying - the Exalted -: {He said, \"He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.'\"} [Al-Baqarah: 71]: \"And {Tuthiru al-arda} means by plowing. According to a group, it is a sentence in the position of Raf' (nominative) as an attribute for the cow, i.e.: not trained, stirring.

However, the second opinion is clearer and closer to the apparent meaning of the verse.\nAs for the opinion that it is in the place of Raf' as an attribute for {Baqarah}, and likewise the opinion that it is a resumed sentence, both entail that the cow is stirring, while the majority of exegetes from the Salaf and Khalaf hold that the cow was not stirring (2), and that the sentence enters into the negation.",

The right of speech was to say: Wa lam yakun ahadun kufuwan lahu, but extreme care necessitated its advancement, so likewise here (2).\nIbn Ashour said: \"The motive for this arrangement is that the composition of speech be in a style more precise than the apparent requirement, which is the concern with presenting what is more atrocious of their crimes. For disbelief in Allah is more atrocious than preventing access to the Sacred Mosque. So the arrangement of the composition was based on presenting the more important then the next more important.

The second: That it is the Waw of Hal, entered upon by the Alif of confirmation, said by Ibn Atiyyah. In this there is a point of view (criticism), from the perspective that if it were for Hal, the sentence after it would be in the place of Nasb (accusative), and if it were so, it would require an operator (Nasib), and there is no operator in the wording. So it must be estimated: The estimation is 'Did you ask while you have not believed?', so the Hamza in reality entered upon the operator in the Hal. This is not apparent; rather, the first is apparent. Therefore, it was answered with {Bala} (Yes), and according to what Ibn Atiyyah said, this meaning becomes difficult.\" (1)\nStudy of the Rectification:\nThe parsers discussed the Waw in His saying: {Awa lam tu'min} and they have two main opinions:\n1 - That it is the Waw of Hal, entered upon by the Alif of confirmation. Said by: Ibn Atiyyah (2), and agreed upon by: Al-Qurtubi (3). Ibn Ashour clarified it saying: \"The Waw in it is the Waw of Hal, and the Hamza is confirmation interrogation upon this state, and the operator of the Hal is an estimated verb indicated by his saying: {Arini}, and the estimation is: Do I show you in the state that you have not believed?\" (4)",

He said: Yes, I knew and believed that You are capable of that, but I asked so that my heart may be satisfied.\" (1)\nSome of them said that the conjunction is on what preceded, and the Hamza is for interrogation and its original place is after the Waw, i.e.: Wa alam tu'min? (2)\nThe preponderant of these opinions: That the Waw is conjunctive, and conjoining to what preceded is better than conjoining to an estimated element, for one might estimate a verb that is not the intended one (3). Moreover, scholars differ in estimating that verb; since it is not textually stated, but rather depends on their understanding of the verse and its context. Therefore: Estimating the deleted sentence is not consistent (4). So it is more appropriate that the conjunction be on what preceded not on an estimated sentence, i.e.: Wa alam tu'min? This is the doctrine of the majority of grammarians regarding (Awa lama) and the like: That the Waw in it is a conjunction particle, and the sentence after the conjunction is conjoined to what is before it, and there is no deleted sentence between the Hamza and the conjunction (5). The Hamza is originally after the conjunction, but it was advanced to alert to its priority in starting speech (6). Therefore: Al-Samin's rectification upon Ibn Atiyyah is valid; since making the Waw for Hal is a far-fetched opinion as has been clarified.\n* * *\n[10]: Ibn Atiyyah said in the course of his interpretation of His saying - the Exalted -: {And it is not [possible] for one to die except by permission of Allah at a decree determined (kitaban mu'ajjalan). And whoever desires the reward of this world - We will give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter - We will give him thereof. And we will reward the grateful} [Al Imran: 145]: \"And His saying: {Kitaban} is Nasb (accusative) for specification (Tamyiz).\" (1)\nAl-Samin Al-Halabi said: \"His saying: {Kitaban mu'ajjalan} in its Nasb there are three aspects. The most apparent of them: That it is a verbal noun (Masdar) confirming the content of the sentence before it. So its operator is hidden, estimated as: Kataba Allahu dhalika kitaban, like: {Sun'a Allah} [An-Naml: 88], {Wa'da Allah} [An-Nisa: 122], and {Kitaba Allah 'alaykum} [An-Nisa: 24]. The second: That it is accusative for specification (Tamyiz), mentioned by Ibn Atiyyah. This is not straight; because Tamyiz is transferred and non-transferred, and its types are limited and this is not one of them. Also, where is the ambiguous entity that needs explanation?\" (2)\nStudy of the Rectification:\nScholars have three opinions regarding the Nasb of His saying: {Kitaban}:\nFirst: That it is a verbal noun (Masdar) in accusative as an absolute object (Maf'ul Mutlaq), to confirm the content of what precedes it; meaning: Kataba al-mawta kitaban mu'ajjalan (He decreed death as a determined decree).",

As for the fourth opinion which Ibn Atiyyah considered probable and Al-Samin weakened, it has weakness for the reasons explained. As for the fifth opinion, it is the weakest of opinions and has no aspect strengthening it, and no scholar preferred it, and those who pointed to it weakened it.

And {Ghayra} is accusative (Nasb) by a hidden verb, this is the apparent view. It is possible that it is accusative as a Hal, as if the estimation of speech is: He said I desire for you a god other than Allah, so it is in the place of the attribute, so when it was advanced it was put in accusative as a Hal.\" (1)\nAl-Samin Al-Halabi said: \"In the Nasb of {Ghayra} there are two aspects. One of them: That it is an object (Maf'ul bihi) ... for {Abghikum} on the deletion of the Lam, estimation: Abghi lakum ghayra Allah (I seek for you other than Allah), i.e.: I seek for you. When the particle was deleted, the verb connected directly, which is not by analogy. The second of the two aspects of {Ghayra}: That it is accusative as Hal from {Ilahan}, and {Ilahan} is the object of {Abghikum} as established. The origin: I seek for you a god other than Allah. So {Ghayra Allah} is an attribute for (Ilah), so when the attribute of the indefinite noun was advanced over it, it was put in accusative as a Hal. Ibn Atiyyah said: 'And {Ghayra} is accusative by a hidden verb, this is the apparent view, and it is permissible to be a Hal' End quote. This which he mentioned of hiding the verb, there is no need for it. If he meant that it is on Ishtighal (Preoccupation), it is not correct; because its condition is that the explanatory [verb] operates in the pronoun of the first or its connection.\" (2)",

The most apparent of them: It is the word {a treacherous one} (khā'inatin), referring to the persons mentioned in the sentence before it. Meaning: You will not cease to discover those who betray among them, except a few, for they do not betray, so you will not discover it about them.\" End quote (1). 4 - That the exception is in the actions. Meaning: You will not cease to discover the act of treachery, except a few acts. Ibn Atiyyah mentioned this as a probable aspect (2), and Al-Samin Al-Halabi weakened it. Al-Samin said: \"What makes what Ibn Atiyyah said unlikely is his saying after it {from them} (minhum).\" End quote (3). Meaning that his saying: {from them} indicates that the exception is regarding the persons, not the actions. This opinion is also weakened by the fact that the preferred meaning of his saying: {khā'inatin} is: a treacherous group. Al-Tabari said: \"That is because the news began regarding their group/community, for it was said: {O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allah upon you when a people determined to extend their hands against you} [Al-Ma'idah: 11], then it was said: {And you will still observe deceit among them}, so since the beginning was about the group, concluding with the group is more appropriate.\" End quote (4). 5 - That the exception is from {their hearts} in his saying: {And We made their hearts hard}.

Thus, it is very weak and not apparent, especially given the long separation between the exempted and the exempted-from, and because making their hearts hard is a branch of {their breaking of their covenant}, and breaking the covenant necessitates hardness absolutely (2). The first three opinions are the strongest and most apparent, and all of them lead to one meaning, which is that the exception is regarding persons, not actions. As for the fourth opinion, which Ibn Atiyyah made a probable opinion and Al-Samin weakened, it contains weakness for the reasons that have been explained. As for the fifth opinion, it is the weakest of the opinions and has no aspect to strengthen it, and no scholar has preferred it; those who pointed to it weakened it. Therefore: Al-Samin's dismissal of the opinion mentioned by Ibn Atiyyah is in its place, except that Ibn Atiyyah did not err by mentioning this opinion—that the exception is in the actions—; for he mentioned it as a probability and did not begin with it nor did he prefer it. * * *",

There are evidences for this, among them: 'Zaid fi al-dar' (Zaid is in the house) or 'indaka' (with you), so they say: The preposition/phrase and the adverb are the predicate (Khabar), while the predicate in reality is the estimated event which governs them. Likewise, they say: 'Ja'a Zaid bi-thiyabihi' (Zaid came with his clothes), 'with his clothes' is a Hal, while the Hal is actually the factor governing it, and so on.

Some exegetes have stated this meaning, such as Al-Wahidi (5), Ibn Al-Jawzi (6), and others (7).",

Second: The Preferred Opinion: What the majority said is the apparent and preferred view, so {collected} is an attribute for the Day, and {the people} is a deputy agent. As for Ibn Atiyyah's statement that {the people} is a delayed subject and {collected} is a fronted predicate, it contains far-fetchedness; because if it were so, it would have been said: 'majmu'un' (plural) (2), just as it is said: The people are gathered (majmu'un); this is the standard analogy based on Ibn Atiyyah's syntax. Al-Farra said: \"If you want the plural of a dispersed thing, you say: 'Jama'tu al-qawm' (I gathered the people), so they are 'majmu'un' (gathered).\" End quote (3). So if the sentence consisted of a subject and predicate as Ibn Atiyyah said, it would have been said: 'majmu'un', just as it is said about the people: they are 'majmu'un', not they are 'majmu'' (singular). The other reason mentioned by Al-Samin in his weakening of Ibn Atiyyah's opinion—that based on his syntax it requires deleting a returning pronoun because the sentence is an attribute for the Day, and the returner is the Ha in {lahu}, meaning: The people are collected for it, and {witnessed} is determined to be an attribute for the Day so likewise what is before it {collected}—is a valid reason. Therefore: Al-Samin's rectification of Ibn Atiyyah is in its place, and the opinion of the majority is the correct one. * * *",

It is also permissible for {ardan} to be accusative as an adverb, and the saying that it is a far land does not contradict its adverbial nature, for here it is an ambiguous, unknown land indicating an undetermined and unconfined place (1). Furthermore, it is not necessary that the land be far, rather they intended that there be destruction/perishing in it (2) for Joseph... peace be upon him. This perishing might be by the land's distance from civilization and its emptiness of life's means, or by the presence of predators in it and the like. This was stated by some exegetes (3). So the intention was casting him in *any* land where there is perishing and indirect killing of Joseph peace be upon him, evidenced by the saying of one of Joseph's brothers immediately after that: {Do not kill Joseph; but throw him into the bottom of the well; some travelers will pick him up - if you would do [something]} [Yusuf: 10]. And that land is not confined but is ambiguous, and its ambiguity increased by the indefiniteness, so it was treated like the names of directions (4). Therefore: Al-Samin's rectification of Ibn Atiyyah in his rejection of the opinion of its adverbial nature, and what Al-Samin said regarding the permissibility of that, is speech in its place. * * *",

And Abu Hayyan attributed to Ibn Atiyyah a third opinion which I did not find in Ibn Atiyyah, which is that there is advancement and delay in the speech, estimated as: She determined upon him and he determined upon her *like that*, then He said: 'had he not seen the proof of his Lord to avert from him what he determined upon her' (2).

Upon reviewing the interpretation of Ibn Atiyyah, I did not find him pointing to this meaning, let alone it being a text [from him]; he sufficed with mentioning the first two aspects, then discussed the readings in the verse, then moved to the verse following it (4).

One of them: And it is the apparent one, that it is the negative sentence from His saying: {it did not avail} (ma kana yughni), and in it is a proof for those who claim that (lamma) is a particle not an adverb; because if it were an adverb, its answer would govern it, since nothing is fit to govern it except its answer, but what is after the negative (ma) does not govern what is before it. It is not permissible to say: 'When your brother stood up, your father did not stand up' (using 'ma'), while it is permissible: 'When (lamma) your brother stood up, your father did not stand up'. The second: That its answer is deleted. Abu Al-Baqaa estimated it: 'They complied and satisfied their father's need' (2), and Ibn Atiyyah also leaned towards this, and it is arbitrary; because in the speech there is what constitutes an explicit answer as I have presented.

In that case, it is claimed that their entering from where their father ordered them was beneficial for them in that it averted the eye from them, except that *when* what befell them befell them—regarding the attribution of theft to them and their disgrace by that along with their brother due to finding the drinking cup in his saddlebag and the doubling of the calamity upon their father—that was not considered a benefit, so it was as if their entering did not benefit them at all.\" End quote (1). 2 - That the answer to {lamma} is His saying: {he sheltered} (awa), and it is the answer to the first {lamma}: ...{And when they entered from where their father had ordered them}, and the answer to the second {lamma}: {And when they entered upon Joseph}.

As for Ibn Atiyyah's statement that rivers is a direct object for an estimated verb, estimated as: 'and He made rivers', it is not weak as Al-Samin said; rather it is permissible, and it is better than the other estimation he approved: 'He cut/dug rivers', because (made) has what testifies for it unlike (cut); He - the Exalted - said: {And He placed therein firm mountains and rivers} [Ar-Ra'd: 3], and He said: {And He made rivers within it} [An-Naml: 61]. However, the mistake lies only in what Ibn Atiyyah said after that, where he claimed consensus on hiding a verb, and said that this consensus is proof that {cast} is not in the meaning of (made) or (created) (2). And Al-Samin did not clarify this in his rectification of Ibn Atiyyah, but Abu Hayyan explicitly stated it, saying: \"And what consensus is in this, when it has been narrated from the interpreters that {cast} is in the meaning of: created and made.\" End quote (3).",

The Kufans held that the conjunctive Waw is permitted to be extra, and argued with a number of evidences. As for the Basrans, they held that it is not permitted for the conjunctive Waw to be extra. Abdul Rahman Al-Anbari discussed this issue in (Al-Insaf), and refuted the evidences of the Kufans, concluding that the Waw in what they cited as evidence is actually conjunctive not extra (2). So Al-Samin Al-Halabi weakened this opinion from the structural perspective, and did not agree with Ibn Atiyyah regarding its corruption from the semantic perspective. The correct view is to say: Even accepting that the meaning based on that is not corrupt, this opinion remains weak; because it has nothing to strengthen it or testify for it, and the Waw is originally a particle established for a meaning; so it is not permissible to judge it as extra as long as it is possible to carry it upon its original function, and it is possible here (3). And He - the Exalted - said in other places: {It is they who have disbelieved and averted you from al-Masjid al-Haram} [Al-Fath: 25], and He said: {Indeed, those who disbelieved and averted from the way of Allah have caused their deeds to be lost} [Muhammad: 1], and He said: {Indeed, those who disbelieved and averted from the way of Allah and opposed the Messenger} [Muhammad: 32].

The apparent view is that the predicate of (Inna) is permitted to be a demand sentence absolutely, except that this did not occur frequently in the speech of the Arabs. It has been established in the Qur'an coupled with the 'Fa', He - the Exalted - said: {Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah and kill the prophets without right and kill those who order justice from among the people - give them tidings of a painful punishment.} [Ali 'Imran: 21]. So the predicate of {Indeed} (Inna) is His saying: {give them tidings} (fa-bashshirhum) (2), which is a demand sentence. It is noted that the syntacticians of this verse focused on explaining the occurrence of the 'Fa' in the predicate of {Inna}, but they did not discuss the predicate occurring here as a demand sentence. Al-Zamakhshari said: \"If you say: Why did the 'Fa' enter the predicate of {Inna}? I say: Because its noun implies the meaning of a condition/recompense (Jaza'), as if it was said: 'Those who disbelieve, so give them tidings', with the meaning: 'Whoever disbelieves, then give them tidings'. And (Inna) does not change the meaning of the inchoation (Ibtida'), so it is as if its entry is like non-entry.\" End quote (3). Abu Al-Baqaa said: \"And the 'Fa' entered it since the relative clause of (alladhi) was a verb, and that indicates the deserving of the tidings of punishment as a recompense for disbelief. And (Inna) does not prevent the entry of the 'Fa' into the predicate; because it did not change the meaning of the inchoation, but rather emphasized it.\" End quote (4).",

Third: Weighting (Tarjih): The preferred view is that His saying: {those who came with the falsehood} is the noun of {Inna}, and its predicate is {a group} (usbatun), and this is the apparent meaning. As for Ibn Atiyyah's opinion that {Do not think it} is the predicate of {Inna}, it is a far-fetched opinion, for the following reasons: 1 - It requires estimation for the speech structure to be valid (1), unlike the opinion of the majority which is consistent with the apparent text of the verse and contains no estimation. The estimation of the speech according to Ibn Atiyyah is: 'Indeed the action of those who came with the falsehood [who are] a group among you, do not think it bad for you' (2), and this estimation contains artificiality and there is no need for it. 2 - That His saying: {those who came with the falsehood} is the noun of {Inna}, so it is preferable that the predicate be about 'those who came with the falsehood' and not about 'the falsehood' itself. Therefore, the predicate is: {a group among you}. If the reader pauses here, the sentence is grammatically correct, containing the noun of {Inna} and its predicate, and has provided a complete meaning. The benefit of informing about them that they are a 'group' is: Consolation that those who brought that falsehood are a co-operating faction, and that is one of the signs of it being a falsehood with no basis. And it was said: It is more appropriate that the consolation is that this is something not agreed upon by all, but rather brought by a small band among you (3). * * *",

However, We sent you to them decisively to cut off their excuses, and to establish the proof against them, similar to His saying - the Exalted -: {[We sent] messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument against Allah after the messengers} [An-Nisa: 165]. (1) Al-Zajjaj said: \"Meaning: Were it not for that, there would be no need for sending messengers, and the succession of argumentation.\" End quote (2). And since the punishment was the cause for the saying, the punishment was treated as if it were the cause for sending [the messenger], so the preventative {lawla} entered upon it. Thus the meaning reverts to: Were it not for this saying of theirs, when a disaster strikes them, We would not have sent you. Al-Zamakhshari said: \"If you say: How is this meaning sound when the punishment/disaster was made the cause for the sending, not the saying, due to the entry of the particle of prevention upon it [the disaster] instead of it [the saying]? I say: The 'saying' is what is intended to be the cause for sending the messengers, but since the punishment is the cause for the saying and its existence depends on its existence, the punishment was made as if it were the cause of sending via the medium of the saying. So {lawla} was introduced upon it [the punishment], and the 'saying' was brought conjoined to it with the 'Fa' which gives the meaning of causality. Its meaning interprets to your saying: 'Were it not for this saying of theirs when a disaster strikes them, We would not have sent [messengers]'.

As for Ibn Atiyyah's statement that {jannatani} is a subject, and its predicate is: {on the right and on the left}, it is weak; because {jannatani} is an indefinite noun with no justifier to begin with (1), and even if it were said that starting with it here has a justifier, making the speech connected to what precedes it and explanatory of it is better than making His saying: {two gardens on the right and on the left} a new sentence of subject and predicate. (2) Therefore: Al-Samin Al-Halabi's defense of the substitution opinion and his refutation of Ibn Atiyyah is in its place, for the opinion that {jannatani} is a substitute for {a sign} is the strongest of opinions and is not weak as Ibn Atiyyah imagined. * * *",

This is the opinion of Ibn Atiyyah (1), and Al-Samin Al-Halabi weakened it (2) as did other scholars (3); because making it inceptive involves cutting the speech, while the 'Fa' connects what follows it to what precedes it with a clear connection. 2 - That it is a conjunction, linking the sentence to what precedes it, so the sentence {then no screamer} is conjoined to the sentence {We drown them}. This is the opinion of the majority (4), and it is the preferred view; for the 'Fa' in His saying: {then no screamer} connects the sentence to what precedes it with an apparent connection.

The Sheikh [Abu Hayyan] said: 'And it appears that the meaning is correct upon that syntax' End quote (3). I say: The direction of corruption - and Allah knows best - is that 'Qurban' is a noun for what is used to draw near to the deity, so if we made it a second object, and {deities} a substitute for it, it would necessitate that the thing used to draw near be 'deities', while the premise is that it is other than the deities, rather it is something used to draw near *to* them, so it is other than them.

Al-Samin said: \"And the direction of corruption - and Allah knows best - is that 'Qurban' is a noun for what is used to draw near to the deity, so if we made it a second object, and {deities} a substitute for it, it would necessitate that the thing used to draw near be 'deities', while the premise is that it is other than the deities, rather it is something used to draw near *to* them, so it is other than them. So how can the deities be a substitute for it? This is what is not permissible.\" End quote (5). And Ibn Hisham said: \"And its direction is that if they were blamed for taking an offering besides Allah, its implication would require encouraging them to take Allah - Glory be to Him - as an offering, just as if you said: 'Do you take so-and-so as a teacher besides me', you would be ordering him to take you as his teacher besides him. And Allah - the Exalted - is One to whom closeness is sought *by means of* others, not One by whom closeness is sought to others.\" End quote (6). And Abu Al-Saud said: \"And there is no leeway for making {offerings} a second object and {deities} a substitute for it due to the corruption of the meaning; for the substitute, even if it is the intended element, must have a sound meaning without it (except in the substitute of error). And there is no doubt that in our saying: 'they took them besides Allah as offerings', meaning: something to draw near with, is absolutely invalid; because He - the Exalted - is One to whom closeness is sought, not One by whom closeness is sought. So it is not valid that they took them as offerings, bypassing Allah in that.\" End quote (7).",

This rectification shows Al-Samin's attention to meaning in syntax; for the meaning must be correct based on the syntax for the syntactic aspect to be accepted. Being grammatically correct does not make it a correct syntax if it leads to a corrupt meaning.

It was said: The feminine first is considering the meaning (trees as plural/collection), and the masculine second is considering the wording (shajar) (1). Al-Tabari said: \"And the correct statement regarding that in our view is the second saying, which is that His saying: {filling with it} refers to the trees; feminized for the meaning, and He said: {drinking on top of it} in the masculine; for the wording of the trees.\" End quote (2).

And He masculinized the second only based on the interpretation of zaqqum, because it explains it and is in its meaning.\" End quote (3). The Preferred View: The reference of the pronoun to the trees of zaqqum; because that is taken from the apparent wording as it is: {from trees of zaqqum}, unlike its reference to the eating; for that is derived from His saying: {Will be eating}. And because drinking is on top of the eaten thing, not on top of the consuming of it (4), and making the drinking on top of the eating - the source - is a type of metaphor (5).

And Al-Zarkashi said, discussing the purposes of parenthesis: \"Among them: The intent of emphasis, like His saying: {So I swear by the positions of the stars (75) And indeed, it is a great oath, if you knew (76)} [Al-Waqi'ah]. It contains two parentheses, for He interposed His saying: {And indeed, it is an oath} between the oath and its answer, and interposed His saying: {if you knew} between the adjective and the described noun. The intent is magnifying the status of what He swore by from the positions of the stars, and emphasizing its reverence in the souls, especially with His saying: {if you knew}.\" End quote (2). As for Ibn Atiyyah, he did not agree with the majority that the sentence {And indeed, it is an oath} is parenthetical, as he said: ... \"{And indeed, it is an oath} is an emphasis of the matter and an alert about the object of the oath, and this is not a parenthetical clause between the speech, rather this is a meaning intended to be cared for.\" End quote (3). Al-Samin rectified him saying: \"And its being an emphasis and an alert to the greatness of the object of the oath does not contradict the parenthesis, rather this is the meaning of the parenthesis and its benefit.\" End quote (4).",

    "text": "And what Al-Samin said agrees with what is established in the language; for the parenthetical sentence has purposes, and among its most prominent benefits: Emphasis and alerting to the greatness of a certain meaning in a sentence (1). So His saying: {And indeed, it is an oath} is a parenthesis intended to verify and emphasize the content of the oath sentence (2). Ibn Hisham said: \"As for Ibn Atiyyah's statement: 'It contains only one parenthesis which is {if you knew}, because {And indeed, it is a great oath, if you knew} is emphasis not parenthesis', it is rejected; because emphasis and parenthesis are not mutually exclusive.\" End quote (3). Therefore: Al-Samin's rectification of Ibn Atiyyah is in its place, except that the disagreement between Ibn Atiyyah's opinion and the majority's opinion is a verbal disagreement and there is no disagreement between them in substance; for according to both opinions the sentence: {And indeed, it is a great oath, if you knew} was intended for emphasis and magnification. * * * [32]: Ibn Atiyyah said in the course of his interpretation of His saying - the Exalted -: {Indeed, it is a noble Qur'an (77) In a Register well-protected (78) None touch it except the purified (79) [It is] a revelation from the Lord of the worlds (80)} [Al-Waqi'ah]: \"The opinion that {None touch it} (la yamassuhu) is a prohibition is an opinion containing weakness; that is because if it is a predicate (information), it is in the position of an adjective, and His saying after that: {a revelation} is an adjective as well. So if we made it a prohibition, a foreign meaning would come interposed between the adjectives, and that is not good in the arrangement of speech; so contemplate it.",

And Al-Samin Al-Halabi said: \"His saying: {la yamassuhu}: regarding this {la} there are two aspects. One of them: That it is negative, so the Damma in {la yamassuhu} is a Damma of declension (I'rab). Based on this opinion, there are two aspects for the sentence. One of them: That its locus is genitive as an adjective for {Register} (Kitab), and the meaning of {Register}: is either the Preserved Tablet, and {the purified} then are the angels, or the meaning is the Mushafs, and the meaning of {the purified} is all accountable beings (Mukallafun). The second: That its locus is nominative as an adjective for {Qur'an}, and the meaning of {the purified} is the angels only, i.e., none see it or none touch its tablet. One of these two metaphors must be adopted; because attributing touch to meanings literally is impossible. And what supports this being a negation is the reading of Abdullah [Ibn Mas'ud]: (ma yamassuhu) with the negative (ma). The second of the first two aspects: That it is prohibitive, and the verb after it is jussive (majzum); because if it were separated from assimilation (Idgham), that would appear in it as His saying: {evil did not touch them} (lam yamsashum) [Ali 'Imran: 174], but it was assimilated. And when it was assimilated, its end was moved with Damma due to the Ha of the masculine singular pronoun.\" Then Al-Samin said: \"And with this that I mentioned, the corruption of the rejection of the one who rejected appears: that if this were a prohibition, it would have been said: (la yamassahu) with Fatha; because the permissibility of putting Damma on what is before the Ha in such a case was hidden from him, especially according to Sibawayh's view as he does not allow other than it (3).",

Describing it as 'Maknun' is like describing it as 'Mahfuz' (Preserved); for His saying: {Indeed, it is a noble Qur'an (77) In a Register well-protected (78)} [Al-Waqi'ah] is like His saying: {But this is an honored Qur'an (21) [Inscribed] in a Preserved Tablet (22)} [Al-Buruj].

This is unlike if the oath is sworn that it is in a protected Book concealed from eyes with Allah, which no devil reaches, nor attains, and none touch it except the purified spirits; this meaning is more appropriate and majestic for the verse (2). 8 - Because the apparent meaning is that the sentence {None touch it except the purified} is an adjective, and the default in it is to be informative (predicate) (3). 9 - What supports it being negative is the reading of Abdullah bin Mas'ud: (ma yamassuhu); 'ma' being negative (4). 10 - Because the opinion that it is negative, the Book is the one in the heaven, and the purified are the angels is the opinion consistent with the interpretation of the Companions and Tabi'un for this verse. 11 - That this is more eloquent in refuting the deniers and more eloquent in magnifying the Qur'an than the fact that the Mushaf is not touched by a ritually impure person (5).",

And what came in the verse, even if it is a negation and the purified are the angels, yet the prohibition regarding accountable humans is derived from it. Ibn Al-Qayyim said: \"I heard Sheikh al-Islam establishing the deduction from the verse that the Mushaf should not be touched by a ritually impure person in another way. He said: This is by way of alert and indication: If the Scrolls in the heaven are not touched except by the purified, then likewise the Scrolls in our hands from the Qur'an should not be touched except by a pure one.\" ... End quote (1). The verse indicated the magnification of the Qur'an's status, and touching without purity violates its magnification, so the verse refuses it (2).

Therefore, it became among the commanded matters: that none touch the written Qur'an except the purified one, in imitation of the state of the angels in handling the Qur'an.\" End quote (3).",

This was said by Abu Al-Baqaa and Al-Zamakhshari. Abu Al-Baqaa said: 'It was said it is a substitute from {and for [his] near relatives} and what is after it' End quote (2).

End quote (3). He means that if it were said: that it is a substitute from {for Allah} and what is after it, what was mentioned would follow: that the substitution based on the apparent wording would be from the Majesty (Allah), so it would be said: {For the poor} is a substitute from {for Allah} and from {for the Messenger}, which is ugly in wording, even if the meaning is contrary to this apparent sense, as he said: Its meaning is for the Messenger of Allah, and Allah Almighty and Majestic was mentioned only for magnification, otherwise Allah - the Exalted - is free of need from the Fay' (spoils) and other things. He made it a substitute from {for [his] near relatives} only because he is Hanafi, and the Hanafis stipulate poverty in giving the near relatives from the Fay'. The second: That it is an explanation for His saying: {and the needy and the traveler}, and the 'Lam' of genitive was repeated since the first one was genitive with 'Lam'; to clarify that the substitution is only from them.

[1]: Ibn Atiyah said in his Tafsir regarding the verse - Exalted is He -: {Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, the alternation of night and day, the ships that sail through the sea for the benefit of mankind, what Allah sends down from the sky of water, reviving the earth after its death and spreading in it all kinds of creatures, and the management of the winds and the clouds subservient between the sky and the earth, are signs for a people who reason} [Al-Baqarah: 164]: 'And al-riyah (winds) is the plural of rih (wind). It appears in the Qur’an combined with mercy, and in singular form with punishment, except in Yunus in His saying - Exalted is He -: {And We drove them with a good wind} [Yunus: 22]. This is the most common usage in speech. In the Hadith: the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, when the wind blew, would say: \"O Allah, make it a beneficial wind and not a harmful one.\" (1) Qadi Abu Muhammad said: This is because the wind of punishment is strong and cohesive, as if it were a single body, whereas the wind of mercy is gentle and scattered; hence it is pluralized, and it was singular with ships because the wind that propels ships is continuous. When it is described as good, the similarity with the wind of punishment is removed.' End quote. (2) Al-Samin al-Halabi, supplementing Ibn Atiyah, said: 'What he said is countered by the variation of the reciters in eleven places, details of which will follow. What can be said is that the plural does not occur with punishment at all; the singular appears in both cases. That is why it was specified in the supplication in plural form.' End quote. (3)",

    "text": "Study of the Rectification: Some scholars of interpretation and Quranic sciences mentioned a rule regarding the occurrence of the two words (the wind - *al-rih*) and (the winds - *al-riyah*) in the Quran. They stated that this word appears in the singular form with punishment, and in the plural form with mercy, and that this is a predominant rule (1). Among those who stated this was Ibn Atiyyah, as he said: '(The winds) is the plural of wind, and it came in the Quran in the plural form with mercy, and singular with punishment, except in Yunus in His saying - the Exalted -: {and they run with them with a good wind} [Yunus: 22], and this is the majority of its occurrence in speech.' End quote (2). Ibn Atiyyah and others used as evidence the hadith: (Oh Allah, make it winds and do not make it a wind), but this argumentation is not valid due to the lack of proven authenticity of this hadith from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. As for Al-Samin, he did not agree with Ibn Atiyyah in what he went towards, refuting him with the difference of the Reciters (Qurra') in eleven places, and that is one of the aspects of Al-Samin's attention to the Readings, where he uses them as evidence to refute some opinions or support them. Then Al-Samin said: 'Rather, what is said is: The plural form did not come with punishment at all; as for the singular, it came in both, and for that reason, peace be upon him, singled it out in his supplication using the plural form.' End quote (3). In this issue, there is detail, and there is some discussion regarding the speech of both Ibn Atiyyah and Al-Samin.",

    "text": "First: The difference between (the wind) and (the winds): (The wind) in the singular denotes the genus, and in the plural (the winds) because they vary in courses and benefits. Thus, in mercy, it is called (winds); due to their multiplicity, for they are the South, the North, and the East (Saba) winds. As for the wind of punishment, it is one, intense, with cohesive parts as if it were a single body (1). Al-Qurtubi said: 'Whoever made the wind singular, it is because it is a noun for the genus indicating the few and the many, and whoever made it plural, it is because of the difference of directions from which the winds blow.' End quote (2). Ibn al-Qayyim said: 'Allah - Glory be to Him - informs about the winds of mercy in the plural form due to the difference of their benefits and what results from them; so a wind stirs the clouds, a wind pollinates them, a wind carries them on its back, and a wind nourishes the plants. Since the winds are different in their blowing directions and natures, He made for every wind a counterpart wind to break its intensity and sharpness, so its softness and mercy remain; thus, the winds of mercy are multiple. As for the wind of punishment, it is a single wind sent from one face to destroy what it is sent to destroy, so no other wind stands against it to break its intensity and repel its sharpness; rather, it is like a mighty army that nothing can resist; it destroys everything it comes upon.'

They made an exception for what came in His saying: {It is He who enables you to travel on land and sea until, when you are in ships and they run with them with a good wind}... [Yunus: 22], where the wind appeared here in the singular within the context of mercy. They mentioned the reason for singling out the wind in this position, stating that it was singular here in relation to the ships; because the wind for moving ships is only one and continuous. Then it was described as 'good', so the commonality between it and the wind of punishment was removed (1). Ibn al-Qayyim said: 'Reflect on how this is consistent except in His saying in Surah Yunus: {It is He who enables you to travel on land and sea until, when you are in ships and they run with them with a good wind and they rejoice therein, there comes to them a stormy wind} [Yunus: 22]. So He mentioned the wind of mercy (the good one) in the singular wording; because the completion of mercy there is only achieved by the unity of the wind, not its variation; for the ship does not sail except with one wind from one direction. If the winds vary against it, collide, and oppose each other, it is a cause for destruction. Thus, what is required there is one wind, not winds. He emphasized this meaning by describing it as good; to repel the illusion that it might be a stormy wind; rather, it is one of the things to be rejoiced in due to its goodness.' End quote (2).",

Likewise, Abu Ja'far al-Nahhas refuted those who argued with that hadith, stating it is weak and has no basis (1). As for Al-Samin's rectification upon Ibn Atiyyah that what he said is refuted by the difference of the Reciters: Indeed, Ibn Atiyyah followed up by mentioning the difference of the Reciters regarding this word immediately after his statement, where he said: 'As for the Seven Reciters, they differed; Nafi' read (the winds - *al-riyah*) in twelve places: Here, and in Al-A'raf: {He sends the winds} [Al-A'raf: 57], and in Ibrahim: {the winds blow strongly with it} [Ibrahim: 18], and in Al-Hijr: {the winds as fertilizers} [Al-Hijr: 22], and in Al-Kahf: {the winds disperse it} [Al-Kahf: 45], and in Al-Furqan: {He sent the winds} [Al-Furqan: 48], and in An-Naml: {And He who sends the winds} [An-Naml: 63], and in Ar-Rum: {And of His signs is that He sends the winds as bringers of good tidings} [Ar-Rum: 46], {Allah is the One who sends the winds, so they stir up clouds} [Ar-Rum: 48], and in Fatir: {And Allah is the One who sent the winds} [Fatir: 9], and in Al-Jathiyah: {and the directing of the winds} [Al-Jathiyah: 5], and in Ha-Mim 'Ain-Sin-Qaf: {He stills the winds} [Ash-Shura: 33].

The correct view is that the statement that 'wind' comes singular with punishment and plural with mercy cannot be established even as a general rule; given that the difference among the ten readers regarding this word was not in few places but in more than eleven places. And we should not establish a rule in the wording of the Qur'an relying on some sound readings to the exclusion of others. It is more correct to restrict this rule to the reading of Hafs alone without generalization. So it is said: According to the reading of Hafs: whatever came of the word (Rih) singular is in the context of punishment, and whatever came plural is in the context of mercy, except for what came in the verse of Yunus: {and they sailed with them with a fair wind} [Yunus: 22], and that singular form came for a reason and wisdom - previously mentioned. Note that there are places where this word appeared singular and plural in contexts other than mercy and punishment, such as the context of parables, as in His saying: {And present to them the example of the life of this world, [its being] like rain which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds} [Al-Kahf: 45], and His saying: {and he who associates with Allah - it is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind carried him down into a remote place} [Al-Hajj: 31]. * * *",

As for what Ibn Atiyyah said, that the 'Qarn' (generation) is defined by the death of elders and the birth of children, using as evidence {and produced after them a generation of others}: this does not support his view. The 'production' (Insha') in {and produced} does not refer to the death of elders and birth of children; because that is a continuous matter among humans and contains no lesson or threat. Rather, the lesson lies in Allah destroying a people and then creating another people after them, containing both young and old, just as He established Quraysh in the dwellings of Jurhum, and as He established Thamud after 'Aad (6). So what appears is that the meaning of destroying a 'Qarn' is: the destruction of a nation among nations, who lived for a time wherein the death of elders and birth of children is not a condition, but rather Allah destroys them if He wills, when He wills, even if their elders have not died and their children have not been born. The opinion that 'Qarn' in the verse refers to 'time' is a weak opinion; for destruction does not fall upon time itself but upon the people who are in that time. Those who said it is 'time' were forced to estimate an annexed noun (Mudaf), so the estimation according to them is: 'How many [people of a] generation/time We destroyed before them'. All of this is forced with no need for it.",

    "text": "Al-Zamakhshari considered what came in this verse as a case of 'Iltifat' (apostrophe/shift) from the third person to the first person; where he said: \"{And We produced} transitioned in it from the wording of the third person to the wording of the obeyed Speaker (First Person), due to what I mentioned of diversification and notifying that He is obeyed, to whose command diverse things submit, and different species yield to His will, nothing is impossible for His volition.\" End quote (1). Ibn Al-Munayyir discussed this with him, stating that 'Iltifat' is only in the speech of a single speaker directing his speech in various ways, and this is not that. For Allah narrated Moses' saying to Pharaoh: {The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets} [Taha: 52], then His saying: {[It is He] who has made for you the earth as a bed} up to His saying: {And We produced thereby [various] pairs of diverse plants} is either made to be from the speech of Moses - thus being from the specific speech of royalty (We ordered/We did) - and this is not Iltifat. Or, the speech of Moses ended at His saying: {nor forgets}, then Allah - the Exalted - began describing His Essence, so it is not Iltifat either, but rather a transition from narration to initiating a discourse (2). 3 - That what came in the verse is all from the completion of the speech of Moses, peace be upon him.",

Moses informed about himself and those with him regarding agriculture and dealing in tillage, for water is the cause of the plant's emergence and by it, it completed and perfected. And the dealing in tillage for the sons of Adam is by Allah's aid to them and His enabling them to do so, so he informed about himself saying: {And We produced thereby pairs}. And He - the Exalted - has said: {Have you seen that which you sow?} [Al-Waqi'ah: 63], so He attributed the tillage to the creation, while He is the Sower and Grower of the tillage, there is no god but He.\" End quote (3). This opinion was weakened by: Al-Fakhr Al-Razi (4), Abu Hayyan (5), and others (6); because the verse contains what makes it unlikely to be from the speech of Moses, peace be upon him. Al-Fakhr Al-Razi said: \"Because His saying after that: {Eat and graze your livestock. Indeed, in that are signs for those of intelligence (54) From the earth We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time (55)} [Taha: 54 - 55] is not fitting for Moses... peace be upon him. Also, His saying: {And We produced thereby [various] pairs of diverse plants} [Taha: 53] is not fitting for Moses; because the most that is in Moses' power, peace be upon him, is directing water to irrigate lands, but producing plants...",

Some directed this opinion by saying it is from the speech of Moses - peace be upon him - on the basis that he heard it from Allah Almighty and Majestic and inserted it verbatim into his speech, and thus he said: {for you} (lakum) instead of: {for us} (lana), and this is a type of quotation (2). The preferred view among these opinions: The first opinion, which is that the speech of Moses, peace be upon him, ended at His saying: {My Lord neither errs nor forgets}, and what follows is a new (inceptive) sentence from the speech of Allah - the Exalted -. Making His saying: {[It is He] who has made for you the earth as a bed} from the speech of Moses, and what follows: {And We produced thereby [various] pairs of diverse plants} from the speech of Allah - which is Ibn Atiyyah's opinion - contradicts the apparent meaning (3), and corrupts the structure/organization. For the 'Fa' (So/And) in {And We produced} (fa-akhrajna) connects to what is before it, so it is not permissible to make this the speech of Allah - the Exalted - and make what is before it the speech of Moses, peace be upon him (4).",

To proceed: These are the most important results that appeared to me through this research, which are as follows: 1 - The Tafsir of Ibn Atiyyah is one of the primary sources for Al-Samin Al-Halabi in *Al-Durr Al-Masun*. 2 - Al-Samin Al-Halabi's stance towards Ibn Atiyyah is moderate; he rectifies him at times, supports and approves his saying at others, and defends him against those who criticized him at others. 3 - Al-Samin Al-Halabi's independence in opinion from his Sheikh Abu Hayyan despite his frequent quoting from him. Therefore, he defended Ibn Atiyyah frequently against his Sheikh, in addition to his many rectifications of his Sheikh. 4 - The purposes of Al-Samin's rectifications of Ibn Atiyyah varied between weakening and refutation, addition and completion, and pointing to a more appropriate opinion or meaning due to an aspect of weighting. 5 - The topics and purposes of Al-Samin's rectifications of Ibn Atiyyah in Readings (Qira'at) varied as follows: • Defending the reading from the perspective of narration and transmission. • Directing the reading and defending it from the linguistic and grammatical perspective. • Rectifying Ibn Atiyyah regarding his lack of knowledge of some readings. • Rectifying Ibn Atiyyah regarding the meanings of readings. 6 - Al-Samin's adherence to the traditional methodology (Athari) in defending sound readings and refuting those who criticized them. He believes that transmission, if authentic, is not opposed by linguistic or grammatical analogy. 7 - Al-Samin Al-Halabi's care in directing Quranic readings, both sound (Sahih) and anomalous (Shadh), defending them, and responding to their critics, especially those who attacked them for contradicting grammatical schools.",

    "text": "8 - The topics of Al-Samin's rectifications of Ibn Atiyyah in linguistic interpretation were numerous, and most of them were in the syntax of the Qur'an (I'rab). 9 - Ibn Atiyyah reported consensus on many issues in his Tafsir, among which were issues where consensus did not occur. Therefore, Al-Samin rectified him on some of what he claimed consensus on. 10 - Al-Samin's rectifications of Ibn Atiyyah are of high scientific value, especially rectifications in linguistic interpretation and Qur'anic syntax. This research was concerned with studying the issues related to rectifications and weighting among them. Many of those issues had not been previously studied or weighted, so I strove and preferred what appeared to me to be the correct view, relying on the rules of weighting in Tafsir and Quranic studies generally, and in linguistic interpretation and Qur'anic syntax specifically. 11 - The reasons for Al-Samin's rectifications of Ibn Atiyyah in Qur'anic syntax varied, including: • Weakness of Ibn Atiyyah's opinion or its far-fetchedness from the perspective of meaning, as Al-Samin leans towards meaning even if it contradicts grammatical structure. • Ibn Atiyyah's syntax contradicting the apparent meaning and claiming advancement and delay (in word order), and deletion and estimation. • His contradiction of the stronger and more famous syntactic aspect. 12 - Al-Samin was not concerned with interpretation by narration (Athar) or interpretation by opinion (Ra'y), which is the reason for the scarcity of his rectifications of Ibn Atiyyah in interpretation by opinion. 13 - Al-Samin omitted mentioning the evidence and reasoning in a number of his rectifications of Ibn Atiyyah, such as sufficing with saying: \"It is questionable\", or \"It contains far-fetchedness\" (1). Among the topics I see worthy of research: 1 - The stance of Ibn Atiyyah, Abu Hayyan, and Al-Samin towards sound and anomalous readings: A comparative study. 2 - The efforts of Al-Samin Al-Halabi in defending and directing Quranic readings. 3 - The rectifications of Abu Hayyan on Ibn Atiyyah: Collection and study. I ask Allah - the Exalted - to make this research beneficial, and to place it in the scale of my good deeds on the Day I meet Him. And I ask Him - the Exalted - to complete His blessing upon me. And my final call is that praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.",
