(See Hadith 149). Perhaps he is preparing to draft a research, or publish an article (!) in which he collects the doubts of the skeptics, and increases in it from his spring that never dries up of ignorance and foolishness!! See - for this - my referencing of some of the authentic Hadiths of the Mahdi in some volumes of \"Al-Silsilah Al-Sahihah\" - and others -, among them the fourth volume under number (1529), under the title \"The Emergence of the Mahdi is a Reality According to the Scholars\", and the fifth volume number (2236) under the title \"The Descent of Jesus and his Meeting with the Mahdi\", and another under number (2293) and (2308). And I have an additional introduction - in about a pamphlet - refuting them in my book \"The Story of the Antichrist (Al-Masih Al-Dajjal), and the Descent of Jesus Peace Be Upon Him and His Killing of Him\" - may Allah facilitate its drafting and publication -. I have also expanded on the referencing of the Mahdi Hadiths in \"Al-Rawd Al-Nadir\" under the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, number (647).\n\n154 - -[«And it is proven in the Two Sahihs from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, may Allah Almighty be pleased with him, from the Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, who said: \"The Children of Israel used to bathe naked, looking at each other's private parts, while Moses, peace be upon him, used to bathe alone. So the Children of Israel said: By Allah, nothing prevents Moses from bathing with us except that he is 'Adir (1). So Moses went to bathe and placed his garment on a stone, but the stone fled with his garment. He said: So Moses jumped after it, saying: My garment, O stone! My garment, O stone! Until the Children of Israel looked at the private parts of Moses. And they said: By Allah, there is no harm (defect) in Moses. The stone stopped so that the Children of Israel looked at him, and he took his garment and began striking the stone.\" Abu Hurayrah said: \"By Allah, there are indeed scars (2) on the stone, six or seven, from the effect of Moses striking the stone.\" And Allah Almighty revealed this verse: {O you who have believed, be not like those who abused Moses; then Allah cleared him of what they said - the verse}»\n------------\n(1) Narrated by Al-Bukhari (278), (3404) and (4799), and Muslim (339).\n(2) Narrated by Al-Tabari in his Tafsir, 22/51, and its men are trustworthy except Bahr bin Habib, the Sheikh of Al-Tabari, for whom I did not see a biography]-\n\nthe distortion occurring in the name of this trustworthy narrator; then he exploits it - intentionally - to lean upon it in weakening the Hadith; he does even more than that! He deliberately distorted the name of the narrator of the following Hadith to place his [claim of] anonymity upon him! Then he placed his comment regarding that on the Hadith; while it has no relation to it, but rather to the Hadith following it, which is Mawquf (halted at the Companion) - as you will see!! -.\n\n155 - -[\"And Ibn Sirin said from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him: \"Moses was shy and covered, nothing of his skin could be seen, out of shyness. So those of the Children of Israel who abused him abused him. And they said: He does not cover himself this much except due to a defect in his skin, either leprosy, or a hernia (Udrah), or an affliction. And Allah Almighty wanted to clear him of what they said\" and he mentioned the Hadith (1). And Sufyan bin Husayn said from Al-Hakam from Ibn Jubayr from Ibn Abbas from Ali bin Abi Talib regarding the saying of the Almighty: {Be not like those who abused Moses} he said: \"Moses and Aaron ascended the mountain, and Aaron died. So the Children of Israel said: You killed him, for he was softer to us than you and more lenient to us than you. And they abused him with that. So Allah Almighty ordered the angels, and they carried him until they passed by the Children of Israel with him, and the angels spoke of his death, until the Children of Israel knew that he had died. So Allah Almighty cleared him of that. Then they departed with him and buried him. And no one from the creation of Allah Almighty has seen his grave except the Rakham (vulture), so Allah Almighty made it deaf and mute.\"\n------------\n(1) Narrated by Al-Tabari 22/52 and its chain is Hasan except the Sheikh of Al-Tabari (Ali bin Musa Al-Tusi), for I did not see anyone who wrote his biography.]-\nI say: This - also - is the (image) of the Hadith intended to be discussed, with its referencing; for its condition is like the condition of the previous one! And in his mentioned referencing - in his footnote - are two misleading points:",

Is it not obligatory to expose the ignorance of the ignorant to warn against him?!

How many authentic Hadiths have they extracted and authenticated, which he weakened from his own side with extreme ignorance in this referencing, and in his commentary on his edition of the book \"Riyad al-Salihin\"! - especially in what he appended to it - there are several examples, and I have clarified some of that at the end of the second volume of \"Al-Sahihah\", the new edition, see for example: Rectification (6).\nSo if he generalizes the attribution to them or to one of them, it does not necessarily mean that it is authentic according to him, so one should not be deceived by it. I have seen him in his commentary on \"Collection of Treatises of Sheikh Muhammad Nasib Al-Rifa'i - may Allah have mercy on him\" (p. 125) attributing a Hadith to Muslim restricted by his saying: \"with a strong chain\"!

You find him attacking and roaming (!), expanding on discussing the paths of the Hadith, and impugning the narrators, and prolonging the breath in that very much - in several pages, and in small font! - pretending that he is a verifier researcher, while in most cases he is a falsifier and an aggressor against knowledge, weakening the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, without proof, and opposing the masses of Hafizs and early Imams, and verifying scholars.

It is not hidden that clarifying the truth in that is either by quoting from scholars - if he is not one of them, as is his reality -, or by his own explanation - if he was qualified for that - as this one deluded by himself claims for himself -.\nThe most confirmed thing that should be explained is if he grades it Hasan and does not authenticate it (Sahih); because grading Hasan implies that there is weakness in some of its narrators, so it should be revealed, and the cause of weakness, so that the reader is insightful about his matter.\nAnd more obligatory than all that is explaining if it was authentic due to others (Sahih li-Ghayrihi), or Hasan due to others (Hasan li-Ghayrihi). This requires the researcher - if he is truly a scholar and sincerely devoted - to track the paths and witnessing narrations (Shawahid) that raise the Hadith to the degree of authenticity if they are many, or Hasan if they are few. All of this is what the man does not turn to! And I find no reason for that except one of two matters:\nFirst: That he does not truly adopt what the scholars are upon in the science of terminology regarding the division of established Hadith into two parts: Sahih and Hasan, i.e., intrinsic (li-Dhatihi), then their division into Sahih and Hasan - due to others (li-Ghayrihi) -.\nThe other: That he adopts that, but he cannot perform it, or does not want to perform it, because he specialized in weakening authentic Hadiths with the flimsiest arguments, and does not care",

    "text": "to strengthen weak Hadiths with follow-ups and witnesses, the fruits of which are the Hadith Sahih due to others and Hasan due to others according to scholars - as preceded -. This latter one is what some of his referencings indicate, i.e., that he does not want to track Hadiths Sahih or Hasan due to others - as I mentioned -.\nAdded to that; achieving that requires research and exhausting effort in many Hadiths. How so, when he is stingy and reluctant sometimes to declare the authenticity of the chain of some Hadiths that do not agree with his desire, and suffices therein by saying: \"The men of its chain are trustworthy\"! While his right is to say: \"Its chain is authentic, its men are trustworthy.\"\nAs for the first division: Sahih and Hasan, he uses it in some Hadiths, rarely - as preceded -, and without explanation. However, he casts doubt on some of them sometimes by coupling that with his saying: \"If Allah Almighty wills\"! - as you will see -; so you do not know if that is from him as verification or commentary?! And this latter one is more apparent!!\nThe reason for his lack of clarification for what we mentioned - of authentication and grading Hasan - in what became clear to me from tracking his referencings -; is so he does not reveal his methodology in that, and that if he did, he would be (like one digging his own grave with his hoof) as it is said...\nLet us bring that closer to the readers with an example: What he authenticated of Hadiths or graded Hasan, if he explained the reason, it would oblige him to authenticate or grade Hasan Hadiths he himself weakened! For it has preceded that the Hasan Hadith only descended from the rank of authenticity because there is weakness in some of its narrators. So if he clarified the narrator whom he accuses of weakness, it would be binding upon him to grade his other Hadiths as Hasan. So for that reason, he conceals and does not explain, especially since in many of the Hadiths he weakens, he does not increase in explaining the cause of weakness beyond saying: \"It contains so-and-so and in him is weakness\" - and he might not",

The closest example of that is the Hadith of Al-Irbad. Yet; he did not refrain from weakening it - as you will see in my refutation of him number (2) -. You find under it another example; which is his weakening of the Hadith \"Follow those after me...\", even though he extracted it from four paths, and a group strengthened it, but he paid no attention to all that! A matter which makes the researcher feel that he does not consider the rule of strengthening Hadith by multiple paths which is considered by all scholars - among them Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah may Allah have mercy on him; and he has a great research in supporting and explaining it, which I quoted in my treatise on \"Refutation of Ibn Hazm regarding his permitting musical instruments and on his imitators\" (1) - and among them is this (Destroyer), as you will see under Hadith (79) -. Therefore, you hardly find a Hadith he strengthens relying on this rule. Like him in this are some ignorant upstarts, and perhaps among them is the author of the treatise: \"Bazl al-Juhd fi Tahqiq Hadithay al-Suq wal-Zuhd\" (Exerting Effort in Verifying the Hadiths of the Market and Asceticism); for he weakened the Hadith of the Market - having extracted it from seven paths, and most of them do not contain an accused person -, and I have refuted him in some of them which Al-Hafiz graded the chain Hasan in \"Al-Sahihah\" (3139).\n\n* As for the third of the calamities of this (Destroyer); when he tracks the paths of the Hadith he planned to weaken, and references them - attributing to sources with their volume and page numbers -:",

Everyone who has participation in this science and knowledge of his method of referencing Hadiths knows that - especially in his \"Da'ifah\" -.\nAnd among his crimes against this Hadith, and his betrayal of knowledge, is that he weakened it by claiming that its narrator (Abdur-Rahman bin Ishaq) is (Al-Wasiti) - agreed upon as weak -. The reality is that he is (Al-Qurashi) - as appeared in the narration of (Abdullah bin Ahmad); contrary to the narration of Al-Tirmidhi which does not have this attribution -. So some of his commentators thought he was (Al-Wasiti), and I clarified the reason for that in \"Al-Sahihah\"; so (the Destroyer) ignored all of that - out of quarrelsomeness and obstinacy against the truth -, just as he ignored Al-Tirmidhi's grading it Hasan, and Al-Hakim and Al-Dhahabi's authenticating it. Then I saw the attribution (Al-Qurashi) had appeared in Al-Bayhaqi's narration - also - in \"Al-Da'awat Al-Kabir\" (134/177), just as I saw the approval of Al-Hafiz Al-Iraqi in \"Takhrij Al-Ihya\" (1/324) of Al-Tirmidhi on his grading Hasan, and Al-Hakim on his authentication. I have explained the refutation of him and those who preceded him in this weakening and delusion - like Sheikh Shu'aib and his students - in Rectification (8) in the appendix of the first volume of \"Al-Sahihah\" (pp. 927-932).\n\n* As for our fourth note; the man does not carry knowledge nor know it.

    "text": "Therefore it is not permissible to attribute the saying to these Hafizs that they require meeting and do not suffice with contemporaneity, if there is no preventing cause for that from those reasons and similar ones. For they - due to the breadth of their memorization and strength of their perception - have observations and reasonings that might be hidden from many; especially the later ones like us. So their observations become a preventing cause from arguing with contemporaneity sometimes, as is the case with those who hold it, who conditioned possibility of meeting with safety from Tadlis. If a cause from the preventing causes is negated, the verifying scholars argued with contemporaneity with possibility of meeting. Here are some examples:\n1 - Mujahid from Aisha: More than one denied his hearing from her, as Ibn Abi Hatim narrated in \"Al-Murasil\" (p. 125). Al-Ala'i answered (336/736) by saying: \"I say: And his Hadith from her is in the 'Two Sahihs', and he explicitly stated hearing from her in other than one Hadith\" (1).\nI say: One of them is in the \"Two Sahihs\" (1776 - Bukhari), (4/61 - Muslim). This is not intended here, but rather Ibn Hibban's saying following Mujahid's Hadith from Aisha raised: \"Do not abuse the dead, for they have moved on to what they sent forth\" - and Al-Bukhari narrated it (1393 and 6516) -. Ibn Hibban said (7/291): \"Aisha died in year fifty-seven, and Mujahid was born in year twenty-one during Umar's caliphate. This indicates to you that whoever claimed Mujahid did not hear from Aisha; was flimsy in his saying that.\"\n2 - Ya'qub freed slave of Al-Huraqa, said: Umar bin Al-Khattab said... and mentioned a tradition of his. Al-Tirmidhi extracted it, and said (487): \"Hasan Gharib... and Ya'qub - grandfather of Al-Ala' -; is from the senior Tabi'in, he met Umar bin Al-Khattab, and narrated from him.\"",

It is not so if you remember the detail - preceded - regarding Al-Bukhari's condition, and that it is specific to his \"Sahih\", and that he is his Sheikh in such grading of Hasan, so remember.\n4 - Humayd bin Abdul-Rahman, Abu Zur'ah said: \"From Ali and Abu Bakr: Mursal\". Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned it in \"Al-Murasil\" (37), and Al-Ala'i (202/145), except that the latter critiqued it saying: \"I say: He heard from his father and Uthman, may Allah be pleased with them; so how can it be Mursal from Ali while he is with him in Medina?! Yes, he narrated from Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, and it is as if it is Mursal.\"\nI say: Would that Abu Zur'ah and others of our Hafizs were cautious in their negation of hearing and assertion of Irsal as Al-Ala'i was cautious by saying: \"It is as if it is Mursal\"; for negation in most cases is equal to saying: \"I do not know\"; so this expression would be closer to correctness",

Ibn Sa'd narrated (5/154) with his authentic chain from Humayd bin Abdul-Rahman bin Awf, he said: I saw Umar and Uthman praying Maghrib in Ramadan when they looked at the black night, then breaking fast afterwards. Therefore, Al-Hafiz Al-Mizzi mentioned them in the group of those from whom Humayd narrated, even if it is possible he was young at that time. Strengthening this possibility - if correct - is what they mentioned regarding the date of his death. In any case, the intention now is not verifying his hearing from the two Caliphs, but showing Al-Ala'i's reliance on (Contemporaneity) in his refutation of Abu Zur'ah; so be aware.\nOf this type is the following example:\n5 - Qais bin Abi Hatim, Al-Ala'i mentioned that he heard from the Ten Promised Paradise, except Abdul-Rahman bin Awf, and he did not attribute the exception to anyone, and it is by Abu Dawood and others. He mentioned from Ibn al-Madini that he: \"Did not hear from Abu Darda' and Salman, and narrated from Bilal but did not meet him...\". Then he critiqued him saying: \"In this saying is a view, for Qais was not a Mudallis, and he arrived in Medina shortly after the death of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and the Companions were gathered in it. So if he narrates from one [of them, then] the apparent is his hearing from him.\"\nIndeed, in these examples is the utmost clarification that the practice of the Ummah's Hafizs proceeded on arguing with contemporaneity - if there is no preventer like Tadlis, or impossibility of meeting -.

He weakened in his \"Da'ifah - 'Riyad al-Salihin'\" the Hadith of Bukhari from Abu Hurayrah raised: \"He told you the truth though he is a liar\".

Perhaps because of this: When the verifier Ibn Daqiq Al-Eid mentioned the condition of safety from Tadlis, he found it very difficult; where he said in his valuable book \"Al-Iqtirah\" (p. 208) commenting on it: \"Except that proceeding upon it in the behaviors of Muhaddithin and their referencings is hard and difficult, necessitating the discarding of many Hadiths they authenticated; since proving the hearing of the Mudallis in them from his Sheikh is impossible for us, unless a claimant claims that the early ones viewed that and we did not view it!

So what is said about one who does this?! Especially since it recurs from him often. He also concealed Tirmidhi's grading Hasan for this Hadith of Hudhayfah, and he graded it Hasan in three places in \"Al-Sunan\", and these are their numbers (3663, 3801, and 3807).\nHe has of such things much and very much, which will be pointed out - if Allah wills and helps me -, a matter I hope will be a cause for his guidance if he is sincere, or cutting off his roots if he is biased, as the roots of those before him of",

Despite this, this (despicable lowly one) transgressed against them and opposed their path, claiming that: \"The chain of this Hadith to Suhayb is a mistake, originating from Hammad bin Salamah, for he contradicted a group of trustworthy narrators by his addition of the companion of the Hadith, Suhayb, and raising it (to the Prophet), and his addition does not bear authenticity.\" Then he extracted it from the narration of Al-Tabari via Hammad bin Zayd, Sulayman bin Al-Mughirah, and Ma'mar, from Thabit... with the same chain without mentioning Suhayb; stopped (Mawquf) at Ibn Abi Layla, and said: \"And this is the correct view.\" So I say: This is the utmost impudence from this fool. For—beyond his audacity in faulting those stalwarts—he uses as evidence for that the narration of the three who contradicted Hammad bin Salamah and stopped it at Ibn Abi Layla—while they are below Ibn Salamah regarding Thabit specifically—as preceded from Ibn Al-Madini and others—and among them is Imam Ahmad. There is no doubt that the Huffaz who came after Muslim—and who extracted the Hadith and authenticated it or used it as proof—had seen the narration of these contradicters, yet they did not pay it any heed; due to their knowledge of the preponderance of Ibn Salamah's narration from Thabit over their narration.

Perhaps—for that reason—this (Al-Haddam) concealed Al-Tabari's mention from the readers; so he did not mention him among those who extracted it, just as he concealed its attribution to those Huffaz who extracted it in their \"Sahihs\": Abu Awanah, Ibn",

Had he cited it, his ignorance of this noble science would have become clear to the readers, and that he is as empty of it as a drum. Here is the explanation: First: The narration of Ma'mar and Sulayman bin Al-Mughirah, extracted by Al-Tabari from the narration of Ibn Al-Mubarak from them, from Thabit, from Ibn Abi Layla—very briefly—with the wording: {For those who have done good is the best [reward] and extra} [Yunus: 26], he said: \"Looking at the Face of their Lord.\" Second: The narration of Hammad bin Zayd from him has two versions: One of them: Like this one, narrated from him by Abd al-Rahman—who is Ibn Mahdi—he said: Hammad bin Zayd told us... with it, briefly. The other: Two trustworthy narrators narrate it from him—at length—similar to the narration of Ibn Salamah. If this is known, what is the preponderant view from this difference? It is clear that what two trustworthy narrators agree upon is preponderant over what a single trustworthy narrator narrates, especially if his narration is shorter in text than theirs. So the narration of Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi is outweighed from this perspective, but we see that two other trustworthy narrators followed him: Ma'mar and Sulayman bin Al-Mughirah, so by this consideration, it is preponderant, and the narration of the two trustworthy narrators is outweighed; this is if we proceeded—Allah forbid!—upon what (Al-Haddam) proceeded upon regarding prepoderance by numbers! And here is another fact ignored by one who has not practiced this science for a long time, and has not understood the methods of the critical Huffaz in dealing with differences between narrations, which is that they note—sometimes—that the difference is merely due to abbreviation—for one reason or another. A trustworthy narrator might cut a piece from the Hadith that fits the context, or he might not raise it (to the Prophet) believing that it is",

    "text": "known to those present, and other reasons that vary with the circumstances surrounding the narrators. What supports this here is what Imam Al-Tabari narrated with a very authentic chain from Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, regarding this verse: {For those who have done good is the best [reward] and extra}, he said: \"When the people of Paradise enter Paradise...\" the Hadith, similar to the Hadith of Hammad bin Salamah, and in it: \"...So by Allah, He did not give them anything more beloved to them than looking at Him.\" So would a scholar say: Ibn Mahdi erred in raising it—and with this completeness—contradicting his previously mentioned brief, stopped narration?! Of this type is what Al-Bayhaqi narrated in \"Al-Asma\" (p. 307) via Qabisah bin Uqbah Abu Amir: Hammad bin Salamah told us, from Thabit, from Abd al-Rahman bin Abi Layla, from Suhayb—raised (Marfu')—regarding the saying of Allah Almighty: {For those who have done good is the best [reward] and extra}, he said: \"Looking at the Face of our Lord, Mighty and Majestic.\" This—as you see—is a piece of Hammad bin Salamah's raised Hadith. So is it said: Qabisah erred regarding Hammad? Or: Hammad erred regarding Thabit?! No, and again no. You have known the reason in what we presented. If you know this, then the truth is that all these narrations—from those trustworthy narrators—revolving around Thabit, are all established and authentic from him. The difference between them is not a difference of contradiction, but a difference of variety. This might be from Thabit himself, so each of them preserved what he heard from him, or it might be from themselves, and this is more likely in my view; due to what was previously explained. Whether it is this or that, the narration of Hammad bin Salamah from him is authentic; because of the addition he has in chain and text, and because he is the most firm of them regarding Thabit—as preceded from the Huffaz.",

(Al-Haddam) opposed him, saying (1/56): \"A weak Hadith, and perhaps it is a saying of some of the Salaf (Predecessors)\"! I say: Keep \"perhaps\" at that star, for it is an innovated saying that no one among the predecessors said, and if it were from the successors, it would be worthy for the likes of it to be thrown to the ground. Then he extracted it from the narration of Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah—only—and flawed it with (Abd al-Rahman bin Thabit bin Thawban), saying: \"He is weak\", and with Ataa bin Murrah (sic; the correct is: Qurrah!), saying: \"Ibn Al-Madini did not know him.\" And from the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, Abu Darda, and Jabir, and he quoted Abu Hatim as saying: \"And this is a mistake, it is only Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir, that the Prophet... Mursal (hurried/disconnected)\", then he said: \"And Al-Daraqutni and Ibn Al-Jawzi said the same.\" In replying to him, I say: I restrict the speech to the Hadith of Abu Hurairah and the Hadith of Jabir: As for the Hadith of Abu Hurairah; we say: It has a good (Hasan) chain, despite the nose of (Al-Haddam); because Abd al-Rahman bin Thabit is not weak as he claimed, rather he is average (Wasat), and thus Al-Mundhiri and Al-Dhahabi said of him: \"Truthful (Saduq)\". The explanation of that will come in detail under Hadith (103). Therefore, many of the early and late Huffaz authenticated it for him, like Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibban, Al-Hakim, Al-Mundhiri, Al-Dhahabi, Al-Iraqi, and others. As for his clinging to Ibn Al-Madini's saying regarding Ataa bin Qurrah: \"I do not know him\"!

For Abu Zur'ah Al-Dimashqi said of him: \"He was among the best servants of Allah,\" and Ibn Hibban mentioned him in \"Al-Thiqat\" (7/222). A group of trustworthy Imams and Huffaz narrated from him, like Al-Thawri, Al-Awza'i, and others. Therefore, Al-Dhahabi said in \"Al-Mughni\": \"Truthful.\" And similar in \"Al-Taqrib\". Ibn Hibban authenticated more than one Hadith for him, as well as Al-Hakim, so see \"Al-Sahihah\" (653). Al-Tirmidhi graded this Hadith as Hasan for him, and Al-Hafiz Al-Mizzi and Al-Hafiz Al-Asqalani confirmed him in their \"Tahdhibs\", and before them Al-Hafiz Al-Mundhiri in \"Al-Targhib\" (1/56), and Imam Al-Nawawi in his book \"Riyadh Al-Saliheen\" (Number 1391). All of this is what (Al-Haddam) concealed from his readers, to induce them to imitate his ignorance, and divert them from following the people of knowledge and insight among their scholars. This Hadith is among the many Hadiths that (Al-Haddam) deleted from Al-Nawawi's \"Riyadh\", and did not include in \"his Riyadh\" (p. 359-361)—Allah has misled him from it, and praise be to Allah—so he did not include it in his appendix dedicated to the Hadiths of Al-Nawawi's \"Riyadh\" that he weakened! Their number neared one hundred and fifty, and he boasts of this in the introduction of the \"Appendix\"!! Likewise, Al-Hafiz Al-Iraqi confirmed it in \"Takhrij Al-Ihya\" (1/10) and (3/202). As for the Hadith of Jabir, our reply to (Al-Haddam)—regarding it—is from two aspects: First: That he cited it as connected via Sufyan Al-Thawri, from Ibn Al-Munkadir from him, and this—apparently—is an authentic chain.

So who is the one who contradicted him among the trustworthy narrators who is more trustworthy than him; such that the error of that claimed connection is proven?! And if the intended error is Abdullah bin Al-Jarrah (2): it is possible; because there is some weakness in him—as I explained in the place referred to previously—but that does not prevent him from having memorized it. Therefore, Ibn Abd al-Barr—the Hafiz of the West—asserted its attribution to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, in \"Al-Tamhid\" (1/316-317). So the mentioned question—about the trustworthy narrator who sends it: Who is he?—still stands. As for Ibn Al-Jawzi, whom (Al-Haddam) preferred imitating over scientific investigation—following the whim of his destruction—he mentioned the contradicter whose Hadith is not permissible to take; even if he did not contradict others due to his weakness—on one hand—and the severe weakness of the narrator from him—on the other hand. For he cited (2/316/1331) with his chain from Muhammad bin Humayd—and from him Ibn Abi Al-Dunya in \"Dhamm Al-Dunya\" (14/7)—: Mehran bin Abi Umar told us: Sufyan Al-Thawri told us, from Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir, from his father—raised (Marfu')—with it.

This is what he did not do here nor in similar cases! For it is observed in what he grades as Hasan that he expresses it with different expressions: First: \"A Hasan Hadith\"—as here. Second: The same, except he casts doubt on it, saying (70, 130): \"Insha'Allah (If Allah wills) Ta'ala.\" Third: \"Its chain is Hasan\" (p. 77, 212, 224, 272, 514).

While in reality, no mention of it preceded in the book, nor from him in the commentary. Rather, that is from his delusions which cannot be counted or enumerated; if that is not from the chapter of: (Behind the hill is what is behind it)! And what confirms what I said is that when he mentioned it in the index of Hadiths (p. 437), he did not attribute it except to the place I pointed to! Thus let the investigation and facilitation be {O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do? (2) Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do}. The third objection: Whatever his intention by saying: \"A Hasan Hadith\", that is from his deviation against the Sunnah, and his crime against authentic Hadiths and their narrators. For the right of its chain mentioned previously—by me—is for him to say regarding it: \"Its chain is authentic (Sahih)\", or at least: \"An authentic Hadith\" meaning: due to others. That is because its men are trustworthy, men of Muslim, except (Qays bin Al-Hajjaj), for Ibn Hibban mentioned him in \"Al-Thiqat\" and a large group of trustworthy narrators narrated from him (1), and suffice you among them: Al-Layth bin Sa'd—his narrator here. Even if Abu Hatim said of him: \"Salih\" (Righteous/Good), he—despite his known strictness—only means that he is good in Hadith (Hasan al-Hadith), and I think he is imitated by (Al-Haddam) here. So at the very least he should authenticate it due to others; because it has many paths pointed to by Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab in \"Sharh Al-Arba'in\" (p. 133), and I had extracted some of them in \"Al-Zilal\".",

The narrator from him (Burayd bin Abi Maryam) was authenticated by Ibn Ma'in, Abu Zur'ah, Al-Nasa'i, and others—like Al-Daraqutni—so much so that he obliged the Two Sheikhs to extract from him. Abu Hatim deviated—due to his strictness—and said: \"Salih\"; meaning: Good in Hadith—as preceded regarding the one before him. I think that (Al-Haddam) imitated him when he limited himself to grading it Hasan, so he is in this like he was in the one before it! Rather, he is worse here; because he contradicted by imitation the majority who authenticated him, just as he contradicted those who authenticated his Hadith like Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibban, Ibn Al-Jarud, Al-Hakim, Al-Dhahabi, and others—like Abdul-Haqq Al-Ishbili. Nothing prevents him from following them—while the truth is with them—except what he is afflicted with of love",

    "text": "of oddity and dissonance, we ask Allah for safety. If it is said: Perhaps he followed Imam Al-Tirmidhi in grading it Hasan? I say: This is very unlikely, for reasons I mention: First: He—unfortunately—does not give weight to all the Huffaz if they contradict him; let alone Al-Tirmidhi; because he is lenient. Second: He contradicts Al-Tirmidhi—also—from two aspects: One: He cast doubt on his grading it Hasan. The other: He did not clarify the type of his grading, as I explained in the one before it; unlike Al-Tirmidhi, for he asserted that it is Hasan for itself. Third: It is possible that Al-Tirmidhi did not authenticate it (Sahih), because it is from the narration of Abu Ishaq, who is Amr bin Abdullah Al-Sabi'i—and there is known discussion about him—narrating it from Burayd. As for (Al-Haddam), he found it from the narration of Shu'bah from Burayd, so what prevented him from authenticating its chain, let alone grading it Hasan?! It is nothing but the love of contradicting scholars, and refuge is sought with Allah—Exalted is He. It might occur to the mind that it is possible he saw Ibn Hazm weaken the Hadith in \"Al-Muhalla\" (4/147-148)—and he narrated it via Abu Ishaq—so he took a middle path between him and the majority, grading it Hasan! Even though this is not from knowledge at all, Ibn Hazm is excused, because he did not find the authentic narration of Shu'bah, so what is the excuse of (Al-Haddam) when he has seen it?! See the extraction of the Hadith in \"Al-Irwa\" (2/172-175), and Sheikh Ahmed Shakir's authentication of the Hadith and his refutation of Ibn Hazm in his commentary on \"Al-Muhalla\", and in his commentary on \"Sunan Al-Tirmidhi\" (2/329).",

As for (Al-Haddam); he opposed him in that, and roamed and attacked (!) in the commentary on it, weakening it from all its paths! I had extracted it in \"Al-Sahihah\" (1011) from the Hadith of Al-Miqdam, and from the Hadith of Usamah, improving the chain of the first, and authenticating the chain of the other, and I concluded the extraction by saying: \"And Al-Tahawi extracted it from the Hadith of Ali, Ibn Umar, and Mu'awiyah similarly\"; indicating thereby that these Hadiths give the Hadith strength upon strength. So (Al-Haddam) came and set himself up to oppose me, and flawed the two Hadiths with what is not a flaw, and pointed to the weakening of the other Hadiths, and he is in that neither truthful nor correct. Before starting to explain this summarized speech, I must draw the readers' attention to this (Haddam's) ignorance of the art of extraction (Takhrij), and the difference between the wording of a Hadith and another Hadith—regarding their difference in indication. We saw that Ibn Al-Qayyim mentioned his prohibition, peace and blessings be upon him, of wearing the skins of leopards and predators; yet (Al-Haddam) did not mention in his critique and extraction of the two Hadiths this wording, but rather mentioned it with the wording: \"He forbade the skins of predators\"! And this is the wording of Usamah's Hadith. And from the completeness of his opposition and quarrelsomeness towards me, and his bad extraction: he started his extraction before extracting the Hadith of Al-Miqdam, whose wording agrees with what Ibn Al-Qayyim mentioned; so he did not mention it, obscuring its meaning towards what the meaning of the wording he mentioned might indicate; which does not agree with the explicit meaning of Al-Miqdam's Hadith. For some have interpreted that the prohibition of predator skins is restricted to when they are not tanned, as came in \"Al-Tamhid\" (1/163) and \"Al-Jawhar Al-Naqi\" (1/18).

    "text": "and understanding of the difference between the indication of the two Hadiths, he would have started with the first of them, even if he weakened both of them together; and this is from his deviation and injustice towards the Sunnah. Here is the explanation: First: He flawed the Hadith of Al-Miqdam with two matters related to the person of (Baqiyyah bin Al-Walid): One of them: Casting doubt on the confirmation of Baqiyyah explicitly stating narration (Tasrih bil-Tahdith). I say: Thus he casts speech randomly, without mentioning any reason for the doubt; which the most ignorant of people and the most malicious of people are not incapable of. That is his saying: \"If the declaration of narration is authentic according to Ahmad\"! The narration of this spares us the trouble of replying to it, due to the clarity of its triviality and detestableness, but I—despite that—place the declaration before the readers, so they may slap with it the face of every stubborn arrogant one: Imam Ahmad said (4/131-132): Haywah bin Shurayh and Ahmad bin Abdul-Malik told us, they said: Baqiyyah told us: Bahir bin Sa'd told us... (so he cited his authentic chain). I say: These are two trustworthy narrators who have narrated from Baqiyyah declaring narration. We do not claim infallibility for anyone among narrators, even if they are trustworthy Imams, but we do not accept—in return—casting doubt on their memory, and attacking their narrations merely by claim, otherwise all sciences would be invalidated, except what Allah wills. Such a thing might extend to doubting all our foundations, as some fanatical Hanafis did in India or Pakistan, casting doubt on the attribution of \"Al-Musnad\" to Imam Ahmad, so I replied to him in the book \"Al-Dhab Al-Ahmad\"—which is currently in print. This is what relates to the first matter. As for the other matter, it is his saying: \"...And even if Baqiyyah explicitly stated narration; the problem is in Baqiyyah himself.\"",

    "text": "So I say: Thus—also—he casts doubt on the person of (Baqiyyah), then turns his back, neither explaining what his status is, nor what his position regarding him is, so he wavers in his doubt! The truth is that there is much speech regarding (Baqiyyah) that confuses the ignorant who have no knowledge of this art, and the science of Jarh (criticism) and Ta'dil (praise). So whoever claims knowledge and understanding; he must explain his point of view regarding what was said about him, based on {Bring your proof}, not merely a claim that no one is incapable of. What has been said about him revolves around absolute authentication, absolute weakening, one saying: \"He has Munkar narrations\", and a middle path distinguishing between his 'An'anah (saying 'from') and his explicit narration (Tahdith). This last one is what the soul finds peace in, and the chest expands to, and the opinion of the Huffaz acquainted with those sayings issued from the Imams of Jarh and Ta'dil settled upon, and books of Takhrij were based upon. Here is Imam Al-Dhahabi the Critic—with his mention of the disagreement referred to in his book \"Al-Mughni\"—he exaggerated in praising him, indicating that those Munkar narrations are forgivable relative to the abundance of his Hadith, so he said of him: \"One of the Imam Huffaz, he narrates from whoever walked and crawled (everyone), and he has strange narrations that are denounced—also—from trustworthy narrators; due to the abundance of his Hadith...\" then he mentioned the sayings about him, and concluded them with the saying of Al-Nasa'i: \"If he says: (Haddathana - He told us), and (Akhbarana - He informed us), then he is trustworthy.\" And he relied on him in \"Al-Kashif\", saying: \"The majority authenticated him regarding what he heard from trustworthy narrators, and (Nasa'i) said: If he says: (Thana) and (Na), then he is trustworthy\" (1). Therefore, he included him in his book \"Narrators Spoken of with Criticism that Does not Warrant Rejection\" (p. 76). Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: \"Truthful, engages in much Tadlis (obfuscation) from weak narrators.\" I say: Meaning Tadlis of the chain; in it is an indication of his not being accused of Tadlis al-Taswiyah (settling the chain)",

I do not rule out that this (Al-Haddam) is one of them, but he conceals and does not explain; such that (he stings then hides)! I have verified the saying regarding (Baqiyyah's) innocence from Tadlis al-Taswiyah in the extraction of a Hadith of his regarding (Intellect); the flaw in it is from his Sheikh, and that is in \"Al-Da'ifah\" (5557). And based on what I mentioned of innocence; is the school of the majority—regarding what he heard from his trustworthy Sheikhs—as preceded from Al-Hafiz Al-Dhahabi—so pay attention! With this, the answer to what (Al-Haddam) flawed Al-Miqdam's Hadith with is complete. Second: He flawed the other Hadith with Irsal (disconnection) after extracting it from the narration of the authors of the \"Sunan\"—and others—and they are six as they are in \"Al-Sahihah\"!—from Sa'id bin Abi Arubah, from Qatadah, from Abu Al-Malih bin Usamah, from his father—raised (Marfu')—; and said following it: \"Sa'id bin Abi Arubah was alone in the addition: 'from his father', as Al-Tirmidhi said, and the Mursal is more correct.\" I say: (Al-Haddam) did not mention the text of Al-Tirmidhi's phrase; because it explains the reason for his preference for the Mursal; for he said following the Hadith: \"We do not know anyone who said: 'from Abu Al-Malih from his father' other than Sa'id bin Abi Arubah,\" then he cited with his authentic chain from Shu'bah, from Yazid Al-Rishk, from Abu Al-Malih, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him..., then he said: \"And this is more correct.\" I say: So you see that the reason for his preference for the Mursal returns to two matters: One of them: Yazid Al-Rishk sending it (Mursal), contrary to Qatadah, and the matter in this is easy—by the rule: \"The addition of the trustworthy is accepted\"; especially since Qatadah is more trustworthy than Yazid, as is known",

And Ma'mar followed him in connecting it, from Yazid Al-Rishk... with it, extracted by Al-Tabarani in \"Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir\" (1/159/510). Its men are trustworthy except Al-Tabarani's Sheikh Ahmad bin Amr Al-Khallal Al-Makki; I did not find a biography for him.

But the narrator from him is Al-Dabari; and in him is known weakness. In any case; this disagreement upon Yazid Al-Rishk in connecting and sending it, is not suitable to be a preponderant factor for his Mursal narration over Qatadah's connected narration—as is apparent. And this is assuming Qatadah's isolation with it, which is not the case; for Ishaq bin Idris narrated: Aban bin Yazid told us, from Matar Al-Warraq, from Abu Al-Malih, from his father... with it. Al-Tabarani also extracted it (511). But Ishaq bin Idris—who is Al-Aswari—is abandoned (Matruk); so he is not used as witness; and there is no dignity.

I believe no one disputes it except a doubting sophist, or a (Haddam) hostile to correctness! Since the matter is so, its implication is that if a trustworthy narrator affirms something, and does not affirm what negates it, he is a proof. The matter here is likewise, because Yazid Al-Rishk's Mursal narration has been proven to be outweighed—due to the disturbance of narrators regarding him in connection and sending—; so it is not suitable as evidence to negate the affirming narration. Rather, it is closer that the narration of connection is preponderant; due to its agreement with Sa'id's affirming narration, and thus it becomes a witness for it, strengthening it. So reflect on this; for it is from the subtleties of this science which we benefited from their extractions and scientific investigations, may Allah reward them with good. As for (Al-Haddam's) saying: \"And Sa'id was contradicted...\"—then he mentioned the narration of Hisham Al-Dastuwa'i, from Qatadah, from Abu Al-Malih; that he disliked predator skins: This is from his ignorance and aggression, as there is no contradiction between a narrator's saying and the requirement of his Hadith. Rather, this is obligatory on every Muslim to act upon the Prophet's Hadith and issue Fatwas by it, and the narrator of it is foremost in that—as is not hidden. Then this (Al-Haddam) always mentions what is for him—as he thinks—and conceals all that is against him—as he believes. Among what he concealed here is Shu'bah's narration from Qatadah... with it, like Sa'id's narration; Al-Tabarani extracted it (509) following Sa'id's narration, saying: Abdullah bin Ahmad told us: Abu Kurayb told us: Ibn Al-Mubarak told us, from Shu'bah... with it.

Because of what preceded; we saw the Huffaz authenticate the Hadith, and not pay attention to the narration of Irsal; like Al-Hakim, Al-Dhahabi, and before him Ibn Abd al-Barr, and before him Abdul-Haqq Al-Ishbili, for he included it in \"Al-Ahkam Al-Sughra\" (2/805) which he dedicated to authentic Hadiths, and added to that indicating the rejection of the Mursal narration, in response to one who might be ignorant like (Al-Haddam): \"It is narrated from Abu Al-Malih as Mursal\"! The other aspect in rebutting (Al-Haddam)—in his weakening of this authentic Hadith—is to say: Let us assume that the correct view in the Hadith of Usamah—Abu Al-Malih's father—is Irsal, but it is authentic in chain, and in that case it is a strong witness for the Hadith of Al-Miqdam which has a good chain—in my critique. And let us assume that it is weak in chain—as (Al-Haddam) claims—that does not harm the Hadith; rather it strengthens it according to Imam Al-Shafi'i and other Imams, as is elaborated in \"Science of Terminology\", even if (Al-Haddam) opposes them constantly, we ask Allah for safety and a good conclusion. Third: If we assume that the Hadith is not strengthened by the combination of the two Hadiths, it is—without doubt or suspicion—authentic by the combination of Hadiths previously indicated (p. 62) from the Hadith of Ali, Ibn Umar, and Mu'awiyah; for it is not possible for a Muslim student of knowledge who stood upon their chains along with the chains of the two Hadiths to continue saying it is weak, except one who is like this (Al-Haddam); for he insisted on weakening it; for he—without doubt—had stood upon them,",

My reply to this nonsense is from two aspects: First: That the generalization he mentioned at its beginning; is lie and falsehood. For in the first source of the three sources, is the saying of Ibn Abi Shaybah (8/494/5296): Waki' told us, from Abu Al-Mu'tamir, from Ibn Sirin, from Mu'awiyah, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade silk garments and leopard skins. Ibn Sirin said: And Mu'awiyah was not accused (of lying) regarding the Hadith from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. And via Ibn Abi Shaybah: Ibn Majah extracted it (3656), and Abu Dawud narrated it (4129) via another path from Waki', with the wording: \"Do not ride on silk nor leopard skins\"; and mentioned Ibn Sirin's saying regarding Mu'awiyah, may Allah be pleased with him. Thus Ahmad also extracted it (4/93): Waki' told us... with it.

But I do not rule out that he might invent a flaw for it from himself to weaken it, for he is unique in his time (!), as he did with (Ismail bin Umayyah) the trustworthy, firm narrator, for he accused him of Tadlis in a Hadith of his in \"Sahih Muslim\", saying about it: \"He did not explicitly state narration in all paths of the Hadith\"! (p. 566 - appendix of \"his Riyadh\"), even though no one accused him of Tadlis. He has much of such fabrication—as alert to that will come—if Allah wills. Some readers might ask about the reason for (Al-Haddam's) referral to the three sources only, without the \"Sunan\" and \"Musnad Ahmad\" which extracted the Hadith with this authentic chain?! I say: The answer, for everyone who knows the man and his methods in demolishing the Sunnah and weakening authentic Hadiths, is: obliterating scientific facts, and making the paths difficult for readers who love reaching and recognizing them. For checking these sources—whose mention he folded here—is easier for readers than those, and I do not doubt that he is aware of the existence of the Hadith in them, and that it has four other paths in \"Al-Musnad\" (4/92, 93, 65, 96, 99, 101) from Mu'awiyah—other than the authentic path mentioned—which alone are sufficient—despite whatever weakness is in them—to strengthen Mu'awiyah's Hadith, so how about if the authentic path is added to them?! And how about if the paths of the Hadiths of other Companions are added to them?! We ask You, O Allah, not to misguide us after You have guided us, indeed You guide whom You will to a straight path...",

Finally: Let the readers reflect with me on his saying: \"And if (Idha) they are authentic...\"; did he link authenticity with (Idha) out of deception and plotting? Or out of negligence and ignorance of the difference between (Idha) which corresponds to (Asa - hopefully) in strength of hope, and (In) which corresponds to (La'alla - perhaps) in weakness of hope—mostly?! For his research and destruction require the expression to be: \"If (In) they are authentic...\", thus my non-Arabness dictated to me! So pardon me if I strayed from the correct understanding of the phrase of the Arab man (Al-Haddam); remembering that roots are embedded! 12 - Ibn Al-Qayyim said: \"Wearing silk and gold was forbidden for males\": I say: It is from the Hadith of Abu Musa, and its completion is: \"And permitted for their females\", narrated by Al-Tirmidhi, and he said: \"A Hasan Sahih Hadith.\" As for (Al-Haddam), he extracted it (1/78-79) from the Hadith of Ali with another wording! And flawed it with anonymity (Jahalah), and from the Hadith of Abu Musa and flawed it with disconnection, and did not cite its wording matching Ibn Al-Qayyim's wording to oppose him! And he opposed me for my authenticating it with its many paths, for I had extracted it in \"Al-Irwa\" (1/305-308) from the Hadith of another group of Companions, among them: Ibn Amr, Ibn Abbas, Umar bin Al-Khattab, and Uqbah bin Amir; so he concealed all these witnesses, giving the illusion to readers that it was not narrated except from Ali and Abu Musa, and he also concealed",

All this (Al-Haddam) concealed, having seen it in \"Al-Irwa\", and what implies strengthening it not in it, he is even more secretive about! Because he does not strive or search except to destroy. Does he quote—for example—from Al-Hafiz Abdul-Haqq Al-Ishbili that he authenticated it in \"Al-Ahkam Al-Shar'iyyah Al-Sughra\" (2/804-805), and from Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani his authenticating in \"Al-Fath\" (10/296 and 317)?!

Even though he does not name the part or volumes he worked on; saturating himself with what he did not do, or out of cunning so his deviation does not appear after he separated from him, even if he still says about him on some occasions: \"Our Sheikh and Professor\"! And that in my estimation is only for personal interest for extraction and hunting for agreements, despite his frequent opposition to him in what he authenticates—like this Hadith—; for he authenticated it in his commentary on it, even if he neglected or ignored—I do not know!—two errors that occurred in Ibn Hibban's chain; he passed by them without alert, and I alerted to them in my book \"Taysir Al-Intifa'...\", may Allah facilitate its publication for people. 13 - Ibn Al-Qayyim said: \"It is legislated for the one performing ablution to say following his ablution: I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, O Allah make me among the repentant and make me among the purified\": I say: Ibn Al-Qayyim asserted its legitimacy, and that is only due to its authenticity according to him, and he declared its firmness in \"Zad Al-Ma'ad\", and it is the correct view upon which many Huffaz are. (Al-Haddam) opposed them—as is his habit—so he flawed it with Idtirab (disturbance/inconsistency)—imitating Al-Tirmidhi—and did not burden himself to search in the chains of the Hadith and its paths so its correctness becomes clear to him from its error, or—at least—",

The summary of that is that the Idtirab is relative not absolute, meaning: relative to Al-Tirmidhi's narration only. Therefore Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Talkhis\" (1/454) rectifying Al-Tirmidhi: \"But Muslim's narration is safe from this Idtirab.\" And he explained that in the best clarification in his other book \"Nata'ij Al-Afkar\" (1/239-241); so let whoever wishes to expand check it. As for (Al-Haddam), he did not distinguish between Muslim's preserved narration and Al-Tirmidhi's disturbed narration, for after attributing it to Muslim, and clarifying that the addition: \"O Allah make me...\" is not in his narration; he commented on it by flaws of Al-Tirmidhi due to Idtirab. From his Tadlis and betrayal of knowledge; is that he said following it: \"And see the investigation of Sheikh Ahmed Shakir of it in his investigation of 'Sunan Al-Tirmidhi'!\" Yet Sheikh Shakir's investigation, may Allah have mercy on him, only contains a refutation of Al-Tirmidhi in a valuable research of his, which he opened saying: \"And Al-Tirmidhi erred in what he claimed of the disturbance of the chain...\", so look at it, for it is precious.

Allah blinded (Al-Haddam's) sight from the mentioned flaw—and praise be to Allah—in his abridgment of \"Al-Riyadh\"; so he kept it in it (292/791) with the addition! And he did not include it in his \"Da'ifah\"! Abdul-Haqq Al-Ishbili authenticated it in \"Al-Ahkam Al-Sughra\" (1/123). Then, when (Al-Haddam) flawed the Hadith with what preceded, he only hid behind Al-Tirmidhi. The truth is that the flaw according to him is (Mu'awiyah bin Salih), for he placed weakness in him in some authentic Hadiths. Among that is his saying regarding some paths of the coming Hadith number (50): \"He has strange narrations\"! And among the many proofs indicating his lack of fulfillment of what he pledged in his introduction to the book of investigating it—in other than the Hadith field of course! For he exposed his nakedness in it—: is this Hadith; for his saying—after the testimony of Monotheism—fell from it: \"Alone having no partner\", and it is established in all paths of the Hadith in \"Muslim\" and \"Al-Tirmidhi\" and others, and likewise it is in \"Zad Al-Ma'ad\" and other books of Ibn Al-Qayyim. So he should have alerted to that, but how could he do that?! While all his activity and concern is directed towards opposing the Huffaz of the Ummah at the expense of his weakening of authentic Hadiths, we ask Allah for safety. However, it is possible to say—in addition to what preceded—: He did not notice the omission due to his lack of concern for the Sunnah and preserving it in action and application, for he does not memorize this litany (Wird), and one who lacks a thing cannot give it, and Allah knows best. 14 - \"He, peace and blessings be upon him, when he exited the toilet, used to say: 'Gufranaka' (I seek Your forgiveness)\":",

As for (Al-Haddam), he flawed it due to his ignorance of this science and his ignoring of its scholars. For he extracted it from the narration of thirteen Huffaz, and not one of them weakened it. Rather, among them is a group of those committed to authenticity; like Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibban, and Ibn Al-Jarud. And among them are those who explicitly strengthened it—like Al-Tirmidhi; for he graded it Hasan—and Al-Nawawi confirmed him in \"Al-Adhkar\", and Al-Hafiz Al-Mizzi in \"Al-Tahdhib\", and Al-Hakim, Al-Dhahabi, and Al-Nawawi in \"Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab\" authenticated it, and Al-Hafiz Al-Asqalani in \"Nata'ij Al-Afkar\" (1/216), and he cited in \"Bulugh Al-Maram\" its authentication from Abu Hatim Al-Razi, and finally: Ahmed Shakir in \"Commentary on Sunan Al-Tirmidhi\" (1/12/7), and others.

The answer is from several aspects: First: The mentioned reasoning is not absolute. We often see critical Huffaz from the later generations authenticating one whom only Ibn Hibban authenticated; like Imam Al-Dhahabi and Al-Hafiz Al-Asqalani.

Third: Among that is that his authentication is accepted if one of the critical Huffaz trusted in their authentication agrees with him, like Al-Hafiz Al-Mizzi, Al-Dhahabi, Al-Asqalani, and their likes.

Here he is agreeing with him on grading his chain Hasan, and in another Hadith coming (1/181) he says: \"I incline to weakening his narration\"! And in a third he says (1/463): \"There is weakness in it\"!! And this does not negate grading it Hasan if he improves the expression, and knows what he says! For if there were no weakness in it, it would be Sahih; as is not hidden to those knowing the difference between the Sahih Hadith and Hasan Hadith in the science of Terminology. He said likewise also regarding two other Hadiths of Amr bin Shu'aib, and that is in his commentary on \"his Riyadh\" (p. 126 and 431), and he did not include them in his \"Da'ifah\" with which he appended it, implying thereby that they are from the category of Hasan. But he does not explicitly state that, nor speak, covering up his inconsistency regarding Amr's Hadith! For he included another Hadith in it (p. 532/64)! And he flawed it there with the narrator from him, Abd al-Rahman bin Harmalah—also—and he is from the men of Muslim!—and Al-Hakim and Al-Dhahabi authenticated him, and Al-Tirmidhi graded him Hasan—as in \"Al-Sahihah\" (64)—, and Al-Baghawi also graded him Hasan (2675). Third: With his mentioned inconsistency and concealment of the reason for agreement, there is another concealment of another path, the least that can be said of which is: It is a strong witness.

So he asked permission from the Prophet of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, regarding her, and mentioned her affair to him. So the Prophet of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, recited: {The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist...} the verse.

It suffices the one advising himself who is capable of distinguishing the authentic Hadith of his Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, from its weak, to do that, and to guide others to it; because his Hadith, peace and blessings be upon him, is not like the speech of his Companions, let alone those after them—as is known.

Rather it is hoarding and destroying, even in what he attributes to the Two Sheikhs or one of them; he limits himself to hoarding and mere copying from them; except in the case of destroying and weakening something of their Hadiths!! Second: His silence about this extraction indicates one of two things; the sweeter of them is bitter;",

The truth is that both matters are combined here. As for the first: It is apparent; for had he possessed knowledge, he would have paused at its attribution to (Al-Dinawari); for this one—and his name is: Ahmad bin Marwan—Imam Al-Daraqutni weakened him—rather accused him—according to what Al-Dhahabi quoted in \"Al-Mizan\" (1/156), \"Al-Mughni\" (1/60), and \"Al-Diwan\" (1/36)—and he is the author of the book \"Al-Mujalasah\"—famous—and the Athar—mentioned—is in it, number (277). And via Al-Dinawari: Ibn Asakir extracted it in \"Tarikh Dimashq\" (12/380): Muhammad bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Dinawari told us: My father told us, from Waki', from Amr bin Munabbih—with a disconnected chain—from Ali... with it. I say: So it is a weak chain—if not very weak—; was his silence about it out of knowledge or ignorance?! The sweeter of them is bitter! This is the condition of the chain of the two sources to which (Al-Haddam) attributed it imitating others! While he is the Grand Mujtahid (!) who weakens hundreds of authentic Hadiths!! And rejects the authentication of the Huffaz of the Ummah and Imams of the religion regarding them!! Third: Was he truthful in his saying: \"Al-Suyuti mentioned it...\"?! I say: Unfortunately; he was not truthful; while he sees that he does not have the last sentence: \"For today is work...\" etc. Fourth: What is the benefit of referring readers to \"Kanz Al-Ummal\" other than forgery and misleading, and giving them the illusion that the Athar is in it in its entirety—as it is in Ibn Al-Qayyim's book—while the reality is contrary to it?! Fifth: He could have avoided falling into such disasters and disgraces; had he been a researcher—I do not say: A Hafiz!!—sincere, not an imitator; then",

I am surprised at Al-Hafiz's silence about him; for he is the one who led the indicated brother to the mentioned identification! Furthermore, Muhajir Al-Amiri has a strong follower (Mutabi') via Waki'—also—from Sufyan, from Ataa bin Al-Sa'ib, from Abu Abdul-Rahman Al-Sulami, he said: Ali bin Abi Talib gave a sermon on the pulpit of Kufa; he praised Allah, and extolled Him, and said... so he mentioned it. Al-Bayhaqi extracted it in \"Al-Zuhd Al-Kabir\" (192-193), and Ibn Asakir (12/381). I say: This is an authentic chain, its men are trustworthy. And Ataa bin Al-Sa'ib; although he became confused (mixed up in memory); Sufyan—who is Al-Thawri—heard from him before the confusion.

I say: No, but it is the decree of Allah and His wisdom—as preceded in explanation—.

(All praise is due to Allah; we seek His help, His guidance, and His forgiveness...), until his saying: 'wa sayyi'ati a'malina' (and the bad consequences of our deeds).\"",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) It is the sermon that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to teach his companions. It had been neglected in some years, so some Imams revived it, such as Imam al-Tahawi, Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, may Allah have mercy on them, and others. Then it was neglected in the later centuries, so our turn came - and praise be to Allah - to revive it. I authored the well-known treatise about it - \"Khutbat al-Hajah\" - and Allah benefited whom He willed of the lovers of the Sunnah with it. Acting upon it spread in the introductions of books and treatises, and in Friday sermons and others - so to Allah is the favor. It is among the wonders that some virtuous people stand in its way, writing a word in his beneficial book \"Tashih al-Du'a\" (p. 454), saying what is summarized as: \"There are innovations in the sermon; among them: committing to opening the Friday sermon with Khutbat al-Hajah mentioned in the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him. The strange thing is that this Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud was narrated by the authors of the 'Sunan' titling it in the 'Book of Marriage' except Al-Nasa'i? For he titled it - also - in 'Prayers'. Whoever tracks the guidance of the Prophet - peace and blessings be upon him - will not see in it a commitment to opening his sermon, peace and blessings be upon him, with that... We did not see in his action, peace and blessings be upon him, nor in the regular guidance of his companions, may Allah be pleased with them, a commitment to this formula in their sermons and opening their affairs. And these authors from the scholars of Islam, you do not see them doing so, among them Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah - may Allah Almighty have mercy on him -; for in his books and fatwas he opens with it sometimes, and with other than it other times...\". So I say - and with Allah is success -: First: It is not obligatory so that it is not left sometimes; rather, the opposite might be more correct, which is leaving it sometimes, so that no one imagines it is obligatory, as in the Hadith of night prayer in Ramadan: \"I feared that it would be made obligatory upon you.\" What proves that we are well aware of that - and praise be to Allah - is that I did not open a number of my writings and verifications with this sermon; such as: \"Kitab al-Iman\" by Ibn Abi Shaybah, \"Hijab al-Mar'ah al-Muslimah\" first edition, \"Tamam al-Minna\" / second edition, \"Adab al-Zafaf\" second edition... and among the last of that is my introduction to the new edition of the first volume of \"Al-Silsilah Al-Sahihah\"... and many others besides that.=",

Third: The referred virtuous person attributed - in this place of his book's footnote - to \"Fatawa Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah\" (18/286-287) pointing to it by saying: \"Important\"! So I say: Yes; it is important; and among its most important parts is his saying, may Allah have mercy on him: \"For the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud did not specify marriage, but rather it is a sermon for every need in the address of servants to one another...\". So what is the value of the amazement of the mentioned virtuous person that the authors of the \"Sunan\" narrated Khutbat al-Hajah in the Book of \"Marriage\"?! The same applies to his saying at the end of his research: \"With this report, you know the jurisprudence of the authors of the 'Sunan' - may Allah Almighty have mercy on them - in titling Khutbat al-Hajah in 'The Book of Marriage', and the scholars' affirmation of its legitimacy before the marriage contract\"!! From the great decree of the Master - Glory be to Him - is that (Khutbat al-Hajah) appears in the volume of \"Al-Fatawa\" - to which the mentioned virtuous person attributed! - in the introduction of two treatises by Sheikh al-Islam, may Allah have mercy on him (18/76, 210) contrary to that place he pointed to - urging towards it -, in which he spoke in detail about this blessed Prophetic sermon; this is besides the rest of the volumes - of it -, or his other books. Similar to him is his student Imam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, may Allah have mercy on him... Why were these two Imams not a role model for this virtuous person, so he would emulate them - even once -, opening a book of his with Khutbat al-Hajah?! Fourth: What confirms the generality of its legitimacy before every righteous deed is the Hadith of Ibn Abbas - which Muslim narrated in the story of Dimad coming to Mecca, wherein the Prophet - peace and blessings be upon him - mentioned this blessed sermon to him, and that Dimad embraced Islam after hearing it; so there was no marriage, nor a marriage contract!! Fifth: It is as if Sheikh al-Islam, may Allah have mercy on him, points in some of his speech to the occurrence of negligence in this sermon - as I indicated -, so he said, may Allah have mercy on him: \"Therefore it was recommended, and done in addressing people with knowledge generally and specifically; from teaching the Book and the Sunnah, and understanding in that, and admonishing people, and debating them, to open with this legal Prophetic sermon. And what the Sheikhs of our time whom we realized and took from and others were upon was opening the gatherings of Tafsir or Fiqh in mosques and schools and others with another sermon...\".=",

Therefore, Ibn Daqiq Al-Eid authenticated it in \"Al-Ilmam\" (1058).\nThus it becomes clear that the Hadith has an authentic chain free from disconnection and Tadlis. Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Al-Jarud authenticated it. (The Destroyer) - as is his habit - deliberately concealed Al-Tirmidhi's speech explicitly stating its authenticity, and the authenticity of Isra'il's narration specifically; which is his saying, may Allah have mercy on him: \"Hasan Hadith, narrated by Al-A'mash, from Abu Ishaq, from Abu Al-Ahwas, from Abdullah, from the Prophet - peace and blessings be upon him -. And Shu'bah narrated it, from Abu Ishaq, from Abu Ubaydah, from Abdullah from the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him.

Then I found a seventh follower for them, who is a mountain in trustworthiness and memory, namely Sufyan Al-Thawri, narrated it from Abu Ishaq... with it. Al-Daraqutni narrated it in \"Al-Ilal\" (5/311) with his authentic chain from him, then mentioned the follow-up of Al-A'mash, Al-Mas'udi, Yunus, and Isra'il, and said: \"And all of them narrated it from Abu Ishaq - with this chain - raised to the Prophet - peace and blessings be upon him -; except that Isra'il among them added Abu Ubaydah to Abu Al-Ahwas, and all sayings are authentic from Abu Ishaq.\"\nI say: So Al-Daraqutni agreed with Al-Tirmidhi that Abu Ishaq has in this",

Yes; rather that - from him - were he to do it - contradicts the advice obligatory on every Muslim for every Muslim, which this (Destroyer) violated - severely - in his plan aiming to weaken authentic Hadiths, and concealing what is authentic of them according to him like this Hadith of Ibn Hibban, and it is referenced in \"Al-Mishkat\" (2476/ Second Verification).\n\n21 - Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"Like his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: 'Indeed our souls are in the Hand of Allah'\":\nI say: This is an illusion from the illusions of scholars; a Mawquf Hadith was confused for the author with a Marfu' one!

Rather Al-Qawariri was asked - by Abu Dawood -: Is he accused of lying? He said: No. Yes; there is speech about the man due to his negligence, and the worst that can be said about him: He is weak. The preponderant view is that he is like the one before him: - Intermediate -, and Ibn Khuzaymah authenticated a Hadith for him in supplication for the traveler, and Al-Tirmidhi and Al-Hafiz graded it Hasan. It is among what (the Destroyer) committed a crime against, so he included it in his \"Da'ifah\"; yet despite his crime he did not increase in it beyond saying (522): \"And he narrates denounced reports (Munkar al-Hadith), as Al-Uqayli and others said, and Ibn al-Madini weakened him.\"\nHowever, in this saying there is a lie also; but it is hidden; for no one said about him: \"Munkar al-Hadith\"; the text of what came in \"Tahdhib al-Tahdhib\" - after quoting Ibn Hibban's validation -: \"And Abu Ahmad Al-Hakim said: In his Hadith are some denounced reports, and Al-Uqayli said: His Hadiths are denounced, Ibn al-Madini weakened him, and Al-Azdi said: He has denounced reports.\"\nThe saying of Abu Ahmad and Al-Azdi is not tantamount to Al-Uqayli's saying: \"His Hadiths are denounced\", for it is lighter in disparagement than this.

However, here he revealed a new ignorance of this science, for his limitation to weakening the chain does not fit with the accusation. The correct in this case is to say: \"Its chain is very weak\", but the accusation is incorrect, rather nor the saying of its weakness absolutely, but it is said: in it is weakness, and it does not negate that he is Hasan in Hadith - as preceded repeatedly -, but between (Al-Jurayri) and (the Children of Israel) are deserts!

I seek refuge in You from the evil of my self, and the evil of Satan and his Shirk (polytheism), and that I commit evil against myself...' etc\":\nI say: (The Destroyer) was not pleased - as is his habit - with Al-Tirmidhi's authentication -, nor did he consider Ibn al-Qayyim's approval of it. He prefaced his comment on it with doubt in its Hasan status! So he said (1/130): \"A Hasan Hadith - if Allah Almighty wills -, narrated by...\"! Then he blackened four lines naming the Hafizs who narrated it from two paths from Ya'la bin Ata', from Amr bin Asim Al-Thaqafi, from Abu Hurayrah! And he concealed - as is his habit - the reason for his rejection of Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn al-Qayyim's authentication, and with them the authentication of Ibn Hibban, Al-Hakim, and Al-Dhahabi, let alone those he did not mention like Al-Nawawi and Al-Asqalani and others, whom there is no room to mention, this - firstly -.\nAs for secondly: He did not explain the reason for his doubt in its Hasan status, although this is very important to present to the readers a new knowledge (the ancients were not capable of!), but he deliberately does that; because if he did, he would be exposed, and it would become clear to people that he speaks without knowledge, rather with desire, as previously explained in detail in the Introduction, paragraph number (2).\nIt is most likely to me that he points by mentioning the first part of the chain to his attacking (Amr bin Asim Al-Thaqafi), because his narrator (Ya'la bin Ata') is trustworthy by agreement, and Muslim used him as proof. As for his Sheikh (Amr bin Asim), no one validated him except Imam Ahmad, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hafiz, and no one narrated from him except two trustworthy narrators - (Ya'la) is one of them -. So I think he rejects this validation relying on delusions and imaginations having no control or rules; except (as he pleases!); and he might invent a defect in it, saying for example: His hearing from Abu Hurayrah is not known - and similar to what happened to him in some authentic Hadiths -, see - for example - his \"Da'ifah\" (p. 535 - 536).\nThen (the Destroyer) criticized the author for joining his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"And that I commit...\" etc.. to the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and mentioned that it is at Al-Tirmidhi (3529) from the Hadith of Abdullah bin Amr.",

Then he blackened four full lines listing the hadith masters who narrated it through two chains from Ya‘la ibn ‘Atā’, from ‘Amr ibn ‘Āsim al-Thaqafī, from Abu Hurayrah! And he concealed – as is his habit – the reason for his rejection of the authentication of al-Tirmidhī and Ibn al-Qayyim, along with the authentication of Ibn Hibban, al-Hakim, and al-Dhahabī, not to mention those he did not cite such as al-Nawawī, al-‘Asqalānī, and others for whom there is no room to list. This is – firstly.\n\nAs for secondly: he did not clarify the reason for his doubt regarding its hasan grading, even though this is extremely important, so that he may present to the readers some new knowledge (which the early scholars supposedly could not attain!). But he intentionally avoids this; for if he did, he would be exposed, and it would become clear to the people that he speaks without knowledge, but rather out of desire, as was previously explained in detail in the introduction, paragraph no. (2).\n\nWhat I strongly suspect is that by mentioning the first part of the chain he aims to disparage (‘Amr ibn ‘Āsim al-Thaqafī), because his narrator (Ya‘la ibn ‘Atā’) is unanimously trustworthy, and Muslim used his narrations. As for his teacher (‘Amr ibn ‘Āsim), none declared him trustworthy except Imam Ahmad, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hafiz (Ibn Hajar), and only two trustworthy narrators transmitted from him – (Ya‘la) being one of them – so I think he rejects this authentication relying upon delusions and imaginations without any control, method, or principles—except “as he pleases”! He may even invent a defect, saying for example: “There is no known hearing for him from Abu Hurayrah” – and the like of what he claimed in some authentic hadiths. See for example his “Da‘ifah” (pp. 535–536).\n\nThen the “demolisher” criticized the author for including the saying of the Prophet ﷺ: “And that I commit …” etc., with the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and mentioned that it is with al-Tirmidhī (3529) from the hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr.",

    "text": "I say: This criticism is in its place, although contrary to his habit of neglecting verification. I do not consider it unlikely that he benefited it from my commentary on \"Al-Kalim Al-Tayyib\" by Ibn Taymiyyah (p. 33/ Hadith 22); for he made this addition from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, although he separated between him and it by saying: \"And in a narration\", but he concluded that by his saying: \"Al-Tirmidhi said: A Hasan Sahih Hadith\"; thus giving the illusion that it is from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah also! So I alerted to this in the referred commentary, and (the Destroyer) benefited from it, but (in silence; neither praise nor thanks!). It appears that Imam Ibn al-Qayyim did not notice this error of his Sheikh, and permitted himself - based on it - to delete his saying: \"And in a narration\" here, and in \"Al-Wabil Al-Sayyib\" - also -, and Sheikh Ismail Al-Ansari - may Allah have mercy on him and forgive him - did not address explaining that in the commentary on it; as is his habit out of reverence for the Sheikh; forgetting that truth and advice do not contradict reverence, rather they are more worthy than it!\nThe point is that (the Destroyer) occupied himself with criticizing Ibn al-Qayyim from what is more important than it of verification, which is explaining the rank of the chain of this Hadith of Ibn Amr. It is taken against him that he concealed - as is his habit - Al-Tirmidhi's explicit statement of grading it Hasan by his saying: \"A Hasan Gharib Hadith\"; just as he concealed - or at least: was ignorant of - Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar strengthening it in \"Nata'ij Al-Adhkar\" (2/345 - 346). The reason for that goes back to the fact that clarifying that returns to strengthening the Hadith and raising it from the rank of Hasan which he doubted - rather cast doubt on -, to the rank of Authenticity (Sihha) in which there is no doubt! That is because it is from the narration of Isma'il bin Ayyash, from Muhammad bin Ziyad, from Abu Rashid Al-Hubrani, from Ibn Amr... with it. This is an authentic chain, its men are all trustworthy, and (the Destroyer) knows that (!), for Isma'il bin Ayyash has the high heel in memory, until Yazid bin Harun said:",

As for his narration from them, it is authentic according to the critical Hafizs from the early and late ones, such as Imam Ahmad, Ibn Ma'in, Ibn al-Madini, Amr bin Ali, Ya'qub bin Sufyan, Al-Bukhari, Abu Zur'ah, Ibn Adi, Al-Uqayli - and others -. Indeed, Hafiz (Duhaym) Al-Shami - and he is of the most knowledgeable people about him - said: \"He is utmost in the Levantines.\" Therefore, Al-Dhahabi said in \"Al-Siyar\" (8/278): \"He memorizes the Hadith of the people of his land, and almost masters it - if Allah the Exalted wills -.\" Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Taqrib\" - summarizing the Imams' sayings mentioned in \"Al-Tahdhib\" -: \"Truthful in his narration from the people of his land, confused in others.\" Those are the sayings of the Hafiz Imams regarding Isma'il bin Ayyash. As for the Mujtahid of the end of time (!), he turned away from them all, and weakened absolutely; and accordingly he weakened a Hadith of his - another one - from his narration from some Levantines, in his commentary on his \"Riyad\" (122/207), saying: \"And Isma'il bin Ayyash was unique in this Hadith... and he is weak in his narration generally, whether from Levantines or others\"! So say - O noble readers! - what you wish - after this - regarding this (Destroyer), who does not refrain - due to his ignorance - from opposing the sayings of the great Imams, and from weakening the Hadiths of the Prophet, upon him be blessings and peace.",

Some examples of that will come. Therefore; I fear (!) that he concealed it for a purpose in himself; which he might reveal when needed!! Otherwise he would have repelled it - as scientific trust requires - in one way or another!!\nI - personally - repelled it with a strong witness from the Hadith of Abdullah bin Abbas may Allah be pleased with them both; I referenced it in \"Takhrij Fiqh al-Sirah\" (250 and 251/ Al-Qalam), therefore I included it in \"Sahih Abi Dawood\" (2390), and he narrated it serially from the path of Zuhayr with declaration of narrating (Tahdith), and I referenced for it - therein - another witness from the Hadith of Abdullah bin Mas'ud.\nAs for Al-Hafiz's saying in \"Muqaddimat Fath al-Bari\" in the biography of Abu Ishaq Al-Sabi'i (431): \"And I did not see in 'Al-Bukhari' narration from him except from his old companions; like Al-Thawri and Shu'bah, not from the later ones; like Ibn Uyaynah and others.\"\nThis is among his wonders may Allah have mercy on him! For he is the Hafiz in truth -; this Hadith - with the narration of Isra'il and Zuhayr - refutes him, and there are other Hadiths for them; I had alerted to that in some places, so Glory be to Allah; {My Lord neither errs nor forgets}.",

Mawquf\".\nI say: The chain of this Mawquf is extremely authentic, narrated by Al-Tabari in his \"Tafsir\" (3/59), then he narrated it from the path of Amir bin Abdah, from Ibn Mas'ud, and it is authentic - also -. This is sufficient to authenticate the raised Hadith; because it is not said by mere opinion!! As is known among the people of knowledge. Therefore, the erudite Ahmad Shakir may Allah have mercy on him strengthened it in his commentary on \"Tafsir Al-Tabari\" (5/572), saying: \"For this Hadith is among what is not known by opinion, and analogy does not enter it, so it is not known except by revelation from the Infallible one peace and blessings be upon him, so the narrations Mawquf in wording are Marfu' in ruling.\" I say: Especially since it is in the interpretation of the Quran; a matter confirming that it has the ruling of being raised, and this is what (the Destroyer) is ignorant of or ignores!!

Therefore, his self did not help him to assert grading a Hadith of his Hasan, so he said about it: \"I hope it is Hasan\"! (See the following Hadith). So this referencing - and the like of what preceded, and follows - is among what confirms what I said in the Introduction; that his attributing the Hadith to Al-Bukhari or Muslim does not mean according to him that it is authentic, for he attributes to it and conceals what is in himself of weakness in it; covering for himself, or misleading his readers!\nMoreover, this Hadith was not unique to (Jarir bin Hazim) who said: Abu Raja' narrated to us, from Samura; despite him being a trustworthy proof - as will come there -. Awf followed him up: Abu Raja' narrated to us: Samura narrated to us... Al-Bukhari narrated it also (7047); so why did he not attribute it to him strengthening Jarir's narration?!

Accuse your opinion... so he mentioned it, and did not attribute it to Umar, and indicated that Ibn Abi Shaybah and Nu'aym bin Hammad in 'Al-Fitan' extracted it\"!\nI say: This referencing is like its predecessor preceded in number (18) - and like it (21) -, among what indicates the scarcity of his care for books of Sunnah and studying them.

Rather that might mean according to him that there is a defect, if so; what is it?! And is it damaging to its authenticity or not?! All that was obligatory on (the Destroyer) to explain if he were a verifier - truly - as he claims!\nThe truth is; the Hadith was narrated by a group of trustworthy narrators, from Al-A'mash, from Shaqiq, from Abdullah bin Mas'ud... with it. Among those trustworthy narrators is Abu Mu'awiyah Al-Darir, so he agreed with them sometimes, and opposed them once, increasing in the chain (Masruq) between Shaqiq and Abdullah. There is no doubt that his narration agreeing with the group is the correct one, therefore Al-Hakim authenticated it on the condition of the Two Sheikhs and Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. I have explained what I summarized here in \"Sahih Abi Dawood\" (200), and I add now saying: Ibn Abi Shaybah said in \"Al-Musannaf\" (1/56): Sharik, Hushaym, and Ibn Idris narrated to us, from Al-A'mash, from Abu Wa'il, from Abdullah, he said... so he mentioned it.\nSo whoever stood upon these facts, how does he not hasten to declare the authenticity of its chain, being knowledgeable of it advising his readers?! If it is said: Perhaps he did not authenticate it due to Al-A'mash's 'an'anah! I say: The matter is not so, for he explicitly stated the authenticity of another Hadith of Al-A'mash from his narration from Shaqiq - as preceded in his book (1/125) -.\n\n46 - \"Abu Hurayrah narrated, that the Messenger of Allah peace and blessings be upon him said: 'If one of you steps with his sandal on filth, then dust is purification for it', and in a wording...; Abu Dawood narrated both\":\nI say: Both revolve around Al-Awza'i, and he was disputed over in it on two aspects",

A group has authenticated it, such as Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibban, Al-Hakim, Al-Nawawi, Al-Dhahabi - and others. Yet, (Al-Haddam) did not add anything to his saying after attributing it to Ahmad and Abu Dawud only: \"And its men are trustworthy. Al-Hafiz said: It was differed upon regarding whether it is connected or Mursal (disconnected), and Abu Hatim preferred the connected one in 'Al-Ilal'.\" I say: This is what (Al-Haddam) quoted, so why did he not authenticate it?! In my opinion, it is because of his known stance regarding the Imam of the Sunnah Hammad bin Salamah - as previously mentioned -, even though it has two authentic corroborating witnesses; one from Anas, and the other from the Mursal of Bakr bin Abdullah Al-Muzani, and he is aware of them from \"Irwa al-Ghalil\" (1/314 - 315), but it is arrogance, egotism, and rejecting the truth! It is also extracted in \"Sahih Abi Dawud\" (657 and 658). 48 - \"The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, granted a concession to women to lower their hems by a cubit\": (Al-Haddam) said (1/211): \"An authentic Hadith, extracted by Malik...\" etc. He obscured - as is his habit - the condition of its chain, which is authentic; so why did he turn away from declaring it clearly to obscuring it?! I do not think it is anything but a love for quarrelsomeness and opposition! It is extracted in \"Al-Sahihah\" (1864). 49 - \"And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'The earth is all a place of prayer (Masjid) except the graveyard and the bathhouse'; narrated by the people of the 'Sunan' except Al-Nasa'i\": I say: It came from paths via Amr bin Yahya Al-Ansari, from his father, from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri... - raised (to the Prophet).

It is extracted in \"Al-Irwa\" (1/320), \"Ahkam al-Jana'iz\" (270), and \"Sahih Abi Dawud\" (507). As for (Al-Haddam); he was stubborn and arrogant - as is his habit -; so he blackened two pages in vain; attempting to flaw it by claiming it is Mursal from Al-Thawri and others, from Amr bin Yahya, from his father, not mentioning (Abu Sa'id) in it! While he knows that Abdul-Wahid bin Ziyad, Hammad bin Salamah, and Muhammad bin Ishaq connected it. So he ignored all of that, and did not deal with the rule of the scholars of terminology \"The addition of a trustworthy narrator is accepted,\" so how about when they are [multiple] trustworthy narrators?! His stubbornness did not stop at this limit when he collided with the narration of Umarah bin Ghaziyyah, from Yahya bin Umarah Al-Ansari, from Abu Sa'id, in Ibn Khuzaymah in his \"Sahih\" and others. This is a strong follow-up (Mutaba'ah) from Umarah bin Ghaziyyah for Amr bin Yahya Al-Ansari, and with the authentic chain to him, which confirms the correctness of the connected narration from (Amr bin Yahya). So what did (Al-Haddam) do?! He placed confusion (Idtirab) in the narration of (Yahya bin Umarah) - out of deception and misleading; for the claimed confusion is only in the narration of his son (Amr bin Yahya), for upon him the narrators differed, not upon his father (Yahya) - as is apparent. As for the narration of Umarah bin Ghaziyyah, it is safe from that confusion, although it [the confusion] is not effective, because it is outweighed - as previously mentioned -. Therefore, Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: \"Its chains are good, and whoever spoke against it did not exhaust its paths.\" This; and from the ignorance of this man in Fiqh is his saying at the end of his extraction: \"And the Hadith is contradicted by the Hadith of Jabir: 'I was given five things no one was given",

He is a loser in any case, for this Hadith is like all other authentic Hadiths that forbid praying in graveyards, and in mosques built upon graves, and from praying in camel pens, and the like. These are specific (Khass), and the Hadith of Jabir is general (Aam), so it is specified by them - as is not hidden from the jurists -. To Allah is the complaint of a time when the Ruwaybidah (insignificant person speaking on public affairs) speaks! 50 - \"The saying of Ibn Mas'ud: You are more guided than the companions of Muhammad, or you are upon a branch of misguidance\": (Al-Haddam) attributed it (1/216) to Al-Darimi, and flawed it by saying: \"This is a weak chain. Amr bin Yahya bin Amr bin Salama Al-Hamdani, Ibn Ma'in said: His Hadith is nothing, and no one documented him as trustworthy. And his father (Yahya), Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned him in 'Al-Jarh' and remained silent about him.\" I say: In this extraction, despite its brevity, are calamities! First: The Athar is not in Al-Darimi with the mentioned wording, but rather with the wording: \"Indeed you are upon a religion that is more guided than the religion of Muhammad, or you are openers of a door of misguidance.\" Second: What he quoted from Ibn Ma'in is not authentic from him. Ibn Adi narrated it (5/122) via the path of Ahmad bin Abi Yahya - and he is Al-Antaki -; Ibrahim bin Urmah said about him: A liar. Ibn Adi narrated from him (5/195) and said about him: \"He narrated from Yahya bin Ma'in and Ahmad bin Hanbal a 'History' regarding narrators.\"",

For despite it being a negation - and proving it is among the hardest matters as known among scholars -; no one said it before him as far as I know. Rather, it is a lie - as will come. Fourth: Ibn Ma'in did document him as trustworthy - in what Ibn Abi Hatim narrated (3/269/1/1487) with an authentic chain from him -, and Ibn Hibban mentioned him in \"Al-Thiqat\" (8/480). This authentication is given precedence - axiomatically - by scholars over the mentioned weakening by Ibn Ma'in - if it were authentic -; because it is a vague, unexplained criticism; so how about when it is not authentic?! Especially since a group of trustworthy Huffaz narrated from him, such as Ibn Abi Shaybah, Abdullah bin Numayr, Abdullah bin Sa'id Al-Ashajj - and others - as you see in Ibn Abi Hatim. Fifth: His saying regarding his father (Yahya): \"Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned him in 'Al-Jarh' and remained silent about him\"! It contains two afflictions: One: His concealment of Abu Hatim's saying about him: \"Shu'bah, Al-Thawri, Al-Mas'udi, Qays bin Al-Rabi', and his son Amr narrated from him.\" This indicates that this (Yahya) is known, not unknown, contrary to what (Al-Haddam's) truncated quote implies. The other: His concealment of Al-Ajli's saying in his book (474/1819): \"Kufi, trustworthy.\" This authentication - along with the narration of those trustworthy narrators from him, and noting his being from the followers of the Successors (Atba' al-Tabi'in) -; casts into the soul that the man is truthful (Saduq), and that the chain of this Athar is good (Jayyid), despite the nose of (Al-Haddam) who wars against Salafi Athars.

For Abd al-Razzaq extracted it in \"Al-Musannaf\" (3/221-222), Abdullah bin Ahmad in \"Zawa'id al-Zuhd\" (p. 353), Al-Tabarani in \"Al-Mu'jam al-Kabir\" (9/133-134), and Abu Nu'aym in \"Al-Hilyah\" (4/380-381) from paths; from Abdullah bin Mas'ud... regarding the story of the people of the innovated Dhikr. And the closest of them to the wording of the book is the path of Qays bin Abi Hazim, who said: A storyteller was mentioned to Ibn Mas'ud who sits at night and says to the people: Say such, say such! He said: So Abdullah came masked, and said: Whoever knows me has known me, and whoever does not know me, I am Abdullah bin Mas'ud; do you know that you are more guided than Muhammad and his companions; or are you indeed clinging to a tail of misguidance! Al-Haythami authenticated this path in \"Al-Majma'\" (1/181-182), and its men are trustworthy; but it contains Ishaq bin Ibrahim Al-Dabari, and there is well-known discussion about him. However, it is strengthened by the narration of Al-Tabarani and Abu Nu'aym from the path of Salamah bin Kuhayl, from Abu Al-Za'ra... similarly. I say: And its chain is good.

I say: This is one of his many misguidings and evasions. Every trustworthy narrator has slight weakness; it is valid to say about him: \"There is weakness in him\"! Even some men of the \"Two Sahihs\" - as is not hidden from those knowledgeable in this science -. Yet, his Hadith is used as proof, even if in the rank of Hasan (Good). This is the condition of this (Kamil), for Ibn Ma'in documented him as trustworthy, and Al-Nasa'i said: \"Not strong,\" and thus Al-Hafiz said: \"Saduq (Truthful) who makes mistakes.\" So he is - therefore - average. So (Al-Haddam), instead of declaring his chain Hasan, evaded; saying: \"There is weakness in him\"! Nevertheless, this weakness disappears and his Hadith rises to the rank of Sahih via the witness which (Al-Haddam) cited after it from the narration of Ahmad (5/44 and 51) from two paths, from Al-Mubarak bin Fadalah, from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, from Abu Bakrah... similarly; but he deviated from the truth again, and flawed it with two defects: 1 - He said: \"And this is a weak chain, due to the weakness of Al-Mubarak bin Fadalah\"! I say: This absolute weakening contradicts what the verdict of the Huffaz has settled upon regarding restricting his weakness to when he narrates with 'an'ana (saying \"from\"); as Abu Dawud and Abu Zur'ah said: \"If he says: 'Haddathana' (He told us); then he is trustworthy\"; and Al-Hafiz summarized this saying: \"Saduq who does Tadlis (obfuscates)\" (1).

So what is said about one who deceives the readers and conceals facts from them?! Moreover, there are other witnesses by which the Hadith increases in strength upon strength; in Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban in their \"Sahihs\"; and it is extracted in \"Al-Sahihah\" under number (4002). 2 - As for the other defect; it is his claim that: \"A group narrated it from Al-Hasan Al-Basri and did not mention the story of the jumping! And they affirmed the end of it.\" I say: He continues to obscure things for the readers! By \"the end of it\" he means his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Indeed this son of mine is a Sayyid (master)...\" the Hadith, and Ibn al-Qayyim did not mention this, so he should have explained. In response to him I say: What the group narrated is another story, evidenced by a narration of Al-Bukhari number (3746) - to which (Al-Haddam) referred - that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was on the pulpit, and Al-Hasan was by his side, looking at the people one time and at him one time, saying... so he mentioned it. I say: This story does not repel the story of Al-Mubarak, especially since he was not alone in it - as previously mentioned -. So they are two stories, and it is possible that they happened on one day, one completing the other, and in it he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed this son of mine is a master...\" the Hadith.

Al-Dhahabi said about (Jarir): \"A trustworthy Imam; he changed before his death, so his son (Wahb) screened him, so he did not narrate until he died. Ibn Ma'in said: He is weak regarding Qatadah. And (Al-Bukhari) said: He might make mistakes.\" Thus he said in \"Al-Mughni\", and because of this slight speech - about him - he included him in \"Al-Mizan\", but he said: \"One of the great trustworthy Imams, and were it not for the mention of Ibn Adi I would not have included him.\" I say: Al-Bukhari used him as proof in his \"Sahih\", so his saying about him: \"He might make mistakes\"",

Therefore, when Al-Hakim authenticated this Hadith of his in \"Al-Mustadrak\" (3/165 - 166) - upon the condition of the two Sheikhs -; Al-Dhahabi agreed with him in his \"Talkhis\", and Al-Hafiz Al-Iraqi confirmed him in \"Takhrij Al-Ihya\" (2/218). The Huffaz proceeded on such authentication in other Hadiths of Jarir bin Hazim, such as the Hadith: \"No servant seeks refuge from the Fire seven times...\" etc.; for Al-Hafiz Diya al-Din al-Maqdisi, Zaki al-Din al-Mundhiri, and Ibn al-Qayyim in \"Hadi al-Arwah\" authenticated it upon the condition of the two Sheikhs - as you see extracted in the beginning of the sixth volume of \"Al-Sahihah\" number (2506) -. This means - to them - that what was said about Jarir is not a valid criticism. Here, a scandal from the many scandals of (Al-Haddam) is revealed to us, which is his concealment of Al-Hakim's attribution of the Hadith and his and Al-Dhahabi's authentication of it. The scandal becomes concrete if the readers know that Al-Bayhaqi, to whom (Al-Haddam) attributed it; only narrated it via the path of his Sheikh Al-Hakim! So I wish I knew why (Al-Haddam) permitted attribution to the student while he does not commit to authenticity in his book, and turned away from attributing to his Sheikh; while he commits to authenticity in his book - and declared it - as previously mentioned -?! The answer we leave to the intelligent readers. And among the benefits of Al-Hakim's narration; is that it is from the path of Wahb bin Jarir, who screened his father from narrating after his change; which blocks the way for (Al-Haddam) and his likes to flaw the Hadith because of him. So the Hadith is authentic, and praise be to Allah, and there remains no meaning for doubting its authenticity - let alone its goodness - except the love of opposition and quarrelsomeness, and refuge is sought with Allah! And if the Hadith is Hasan according to him as he hopes; then why did he not strengthen the Hadith of Abu Hurayra and the Hadith of Abu Bakrah with it - which he weakened - as previously mentioned?! - The answer is with the intelligent readers - as well -.",

So it is no wonder that those we mentioned of the Huffaz authenticated it. As for (Al-Haddam); he left his readers in confusion; on one hand, he flawed the mentioned path because of (Humaydah), and on the other hand he said: \"A group authenticated it,\" so who is he with, I wonder?! I think he is confused within himself {...[belonging] neither to these nor to those}!! Because he has no knowledge, nor insight to guide him, and the least of it is to follow {...the path of the believers}!

He only declares absolutely without explanation - to cover his ignorance and opposition to the rules of the science of Hadith terminology -. The reality is that regarding Simak - who is Ibn Harb - scholars have differed upon three opinions: Absolute trustworthiness, absolute weakness, and detailing; which is the opinion of Al-Hafiz Yaqub bin Shaybah: \"Whoever heard from him long ago like Shu'bah and Sufyan, their Hadith from him is authentic and straight, and Ibn Al-Mubarak's saying about him: 'Weak' is - as we see - regarding those who heard from him later.\" Similar is reported from Al-Daraqutni, and for that reason Muslim only extracted from him the narration of Sufyan and Shu'bah from him, as in \"Tahdhib Al-Mizzi\". Al-Hafiz proceeded upon this, saying about this Hadith (1/300 - Fath): \"Some people flawed it due to Simak bin Harb, because he used to accept instruction (Talqin), but Shu'bah narrated it from him; and he does not take from his sheikhs except their authentic Hadith.\" And he said in another place (1/342): \"It is an authentic Hadith; narrated by the Four, and Ibn Khuzaymah - and others -.\" The Hadith of Shu'bah which Al-Hafiz referred to, was extracted by Al-Bazzar in his \"Musnad\" (1/132/250 - \"Kashf al-Astar\"), and Al-Hakim (1/159), and he said: \"Authentic, and no defect is preserved for it\"; and Al-Dhahabi agreed with him.

It is extracted in \"Sahih Abi Dawud\" (61); and Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibban - as previously mentioned -, and Ibn al-Jarud also authenticated it. The Hadith of Abu Sa'id - coming after it along with the refutation of (Al-Haddam) - testifies for it. 55 - \"And in 'Al-Musnad' and 'Al-Sunan' from Abu Sa'id, who said: It was said: O Messenger of Allah! Shall we perform ablution from the well of Buda'ah?... So he said: 'Water is pure, nothing makes it impure.' Al-Tirmidhi said: 'A Hasan Hadith', and Imam Ahmad said: 'The Hadith of the well of Buda'ah is authentic'\": I say: Likewise Yahya bin Ma'in and Al-Nawawi authenticated it. Al-Tirmidhi said - following his mentioned grading of Hasan -: \"This Hadith has been narrated from more than one path from Abu Sa'id.\" As for (Al-Haddam), he said (1/229) - after attributing it to a group -: \"And in it is weakness I explained in other than this place\"! I say: There is nothing in it except the unknown status (Jahalah Hal) of one of its narrators; so it is strengthened by the paths Al-Tirmidhi pointed to, and by witnesses for it which I extracted in \"Sahih Abi Dawud\" (59 and 60), and Ibn Hazm used some of them as proof, see \"Al-Talkhis Al-Habir\" (1/12 - 14), and \"Irwa al-Ghalil\" (1/45 - 46). But (Al-Haddam) gives no weight to what scholars are upon regarding strengthening a Hadith by numerous paths, and this is one of the causes of his deviation from {the path of the believers}, and his agreement with the misleading people of desires! 56 - \"He, peace and blessings be upon him, used to accept the invitation of whoever invited him, and eat from his food, and a Jew hosted him with barley bread and rancid fat\":",

    "text": "(Al-Haddam) said (1/230): \"See 'Musnad Ahmad' (3/180 and 238)\"! I say: This, being a referral and not an extraction; is an error contrary to what scholars are upon, that it is not permissible to attribute to other than the \"Two Sahihs\" or one of them, if the Hadith is in them or in one of them, because that does not imply authenticity; unlike the reverse. This, if it indicates anything - as they say today -; indicates (Al-Haddam's) ignorance of the books of Sunnah and their Hadiths, except to the extent that indices placed old and new help him to indicate the place of Hadiths in them, and facilitate finding them; and this is if he uses them well, or is active to benefit from them! I say this for the following reasons: First: In the two places referred to from \"Al-Musnad\", the word: (Jew) is not there! In referring to them, there is a clear lie, but (Al-Haddam) does not care; because it is something he is used to!! Second: The Hadith is in two other places in \"Al-Musnad\" (3/210 - 211 and 270) via the path of Aban: Qatadah told us, from Anas: That a Jew invited the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, to barley bread and rancid fat, so he accepted. Third: It is in two places in \"Sahih Al-Bukhari\" (2069, 2508) via another path from Qatadah... with it similarly; without the word Jew - and it is extracted in \"Al-Irwa\" (5/231), and \"Mukhtasar Al-Shama'il\" (177/287) -. Fourth: It was necessary to attribute it to Al-Bukhari to strengthen Ahmad's chain, because he [Ahmad] does not commit to authenticity, especially since it contains the 'An'ana (saying \"from\") of Qatadah - as you saw -; for it is known about (Al-Haddam) that he flaws the authentic chain with it - as he did with the Hadith mentioned previously (36) -, and perhaps he intentionally left attributing it to him - if he recalled his narration -; so as not to increase in scandal",

For everyone knows that attributing the Hadith to Al-Bukhari is not like attributing it to Ahmad; so his turning away from him to him - or at least not combining them -; must have been out of ignorance, or ignoring - intentionally - what I mentioned just now -! And the sweeter of them is bitter! Fifth: His mentioned attribution to Ahmad indicates from another aspect his ignorance of the Sunnah and its Hadiths; because the first part of the paragraph of \"Al-Ighatha\": \"He used to accept the invitation of whoever invited him\" is not in Ahmad - as you saw -. And regarding it there are many Hadiths I had extracted in the fifth volume of \"Al-Sahihah\" (2125), so I suffice with pointing to them: Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah narrated it from Anas, Al-Tabarani from Ibn Abbas, Ibn Adi from Abu Hurayra, Abu Al-Sheikh and Al-Hakim - and he and Al-Dhahabi authenticated it - from Abu Musa, and Ibn Sa'd and Al-Bazzar from Jabir, and from Al-Hasan Al-Basri - and others - as Mursal. 57 - \"And Imam Ahmad narrated in his 'Musnad' from him, peace and blessings be upon him: 'I was sent with the tolerant Hanifiyya'.\" (Al-Haddam) said (1/231): \"No Hadith regarding it is authentic\"! Then he extracted it from the Hadith of Aisha, Ibn Abbas, Abu Umamah, and Jabir, then said: \"And in each of them is weakness\"! I say: The absolute statement is not conceded, for Al-Hafiz graded one of them Hasan, and assuming it [the weakness], that means to scholars that it is an authentic Hadith due to others (Sahih li-Ghayrihi), but (Al-Haddam) is stubborn and arrogant about following {the path of the believers} - as we mentioned and proved repeatedly!! -. Then he was ignorant of - or ignored - two other Mursal witnesses; the chain of one of them is authentic, and they - with others - are extracted in the beginning of my book \"Tamam al-Minnah fi al-Ta'liq 'ala Fiqh al-Sunnah\". Then I found another witness for it from the Hadith of Umayyah bin Sa'd bin Abdullah Al-Khuza'i, narrated by Ibn Asakir in \"Tarikh Dimashq\" (7/631), and Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir indicated its strengthening by the sum of its paths in his \"Tafsir\" (1/217), (2/254, 403),",

I have extracted the Hadith, and elaborated on the anomaly of this sentence in \"Al-Irwa\" (1/132 - 133). Likewise, the Quarrelsome one passed over the Hadith in his edition of \"Riyad al-Salihin\" (295/285); and I do not know what his comment will be on Ibn al-Qayyim's assertion of the mentioned interpolation in \"Hadi al-Arwah ila Bilad al-Afrah\" - if he tampers with it, and ruins it -?! Will he refute him and be arrogant?! Or pass over it as he passed over the Hadith here, because investigation in such matters does not concern him?! 63 - \"Adornment reaches of the believer where Wudu reaches\": I say: An authentic Hadith from the narration of Abu Hurayra - also -; narrated by Muslim and others via Abu Hazim from him, and in it is a story; and it is extracted in \"Al-Sahihah\" under number (252) from paths from him. (Al-Haddam) did not extract it, and the reason - in my assumption - is that it did not occur in the book explicitly attributed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, so he did not notice it to extract it via the indices upon which he is dependent! And it is not in his memory; due to his lack of care for Prophetic Hadiths and his ignorance of them, except to criticize them! - as I have alerted to that repeatedly -. This is his excuse if ignorance is an acceptable excuse from such a nullifying critic! It is possible that the reason is other than ignorance; and that goes back to two things: One: His lack of interest in extracting what he has no desire in. Ibn al-Qayyim ended this chapter - in which he cited the Hadith before this, then this one - saying: \"As for the Hadith of Adornment, adornment is beautifying what is in its place, so if it exceeds its place",

The other: That (Al-Haddam) does not extract the Hadiths while they are in their places in the book, but rather they are presented to him by some ignorant people on white papers for him to blacken them with his extraction! Then they are presented to the printing press, so he does not know the Hadiths intended to be extracted except through those who present them to him!! And what supports this; is the occurrence of some comments in other than their place; as will be alerted to when commenting on (Al-Haddam's) reference to the Hadith of the blind man number (73). Whatever the reason; by it he exits the group of verifying writers and extractors, and lines up in the ranks of book merchants, whose only concern from printing them is financial gain; and it is a very dangerous phenomenon, from which perhaps only a few authors and publishers escape; and Allah is the One sought for help. 64 - \"Al-Bukhari said: ... from Ibn Jurayj, he said: Ata said, from Ibn Abbas: The idols that were among the people of Noah became among the Arabs after...\" and in it is the story of (Wadd), (Suwa'), (Yaghuth), (Ya'uq), and (Nasr), and that they were righteous men; so Satan inspired their people to erect idols for them, so they worshipped them: (Al-Haddam) said (1/268): \"Extracted by Al-Bukhari (4920); and its chain is weak. They say: This Ata is Al-Khurasani, and the evidences support this. And this Hadith is among what Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him, was criticized for extracting in his 'Sahih'; see 'Al-Fath' (8/667 - 668).\" I say: And in his referral to \"Al-Fath\" is malicious deception (Tadlis) from two aspects:",

    "text": "The first: That Al-Hafiz did not say: \"He was criticized (Ukhidha)\"! Rather he said: \"And this is among what was considered grave against Al-Bukhari\"! The other - and it is the more important -: That he gave the illusion to readers that Al-Hafiz conceded to the alleged criticism! While his words are explicit in rejecting it; for he said: \"But what is strong in my view; is that this Hadith specifically with Ibn Jurayj: is from Ata Al-Khurasani, and from Ata bin Abi Rabah together...\" etc.; except that he did not mention evidence for the mentioned strengthening, other than good opinion of Imam Al-Bukhari... The point: That (Al-Haddam) is not trusted in his transfer and claims; due to his many deceptions and contradictions. And from that is his saying: \"And the evidences support this\"; so oh wonder at his vanity and arrogance! He wants the readers to submit to his weakening of what Al-Bukhari authenticated, without presenting evidence for the weakening, and does not want them to submit to Al-Bukhari's authentication! Which is - certainly - the most likely, because this Athar has other paths from Ibn Abbas, and another from Ikrimah; and he is among his students; Ibn Jarir Al-Tabari extracted them in his \"Tafsir\" (29/62), to other than that of many Athars in \"Tafsir Ibn Kathir\", and \"Al-Durr Al-Manthur\"; which gives the feeling to whoever examines them that this was well-known among the Salaf.

Therefore he remained silent, knowing that Al-Bukhari's suspended narrations are not cited in one manner - in his own terminology - as scholars explained. Whatever he asserted with certainty (Jazm) is authentic, and what he did not assert with certainty might be so or might be so. And this Athar is among what Al-Bukhari asserted with certainty, saying: \"And Umar saw Anas bin Malik praying...\" etc. So why did (Al-Haddam) suffice with stating it is suspended, and did not state that it is an authentic suspended narration?! The answer is known to all those who track these extractions! This is - firstly -. And secondly: What confirms what I mentioned; is that he ignored whoever connected it and did not explain it, and had he done so, its authenticity would have become clear to the readers!

So it is possible that Abu Dawud Al-Harrani heard from this (Umar) - the trustworthy one -, unlike (Umar bin Suhban) - the weak one -; for - despite being Medinan -, they did not mention a visit to Damascus for him; and Allah knows best. Another preponderant factor might be added to what preceded, which is the closeness of Ibn Abd al-Barr's era to Al-Bazzar, so trust in his narration and transmission from him is stronger than the transmission of some later scholars from him - like Al-Haythami and others -. This is what appeared to me of preference, so if I am correct it is from Allah, and if I err it is from myself. And if the printing of \"Musnad Al-Bazzar\" called \"Al-Bahr Al-Zakhkhar\" is completed, what clarifies the matter more will be revealed - regarding its correctness or error -. And the intention was not directed to delving into this, were it not for the necessity of clarifying this (Haddam's) concealment of knowledge that would be a proof against him.

Second: He said: \"There is weakness in him\"! If he means a weakness that does not negate the correctness of his chain, let alone its goodness - because the Hasan by its nature has weakness in it - as I alerted to repeatedly -, I say: If he means this, it is an exposed opposition to the author's grading of it as Hasan, and to others of the Huffaz who authenticated it - as will come -. So it was obligatory on him to agree with them even on grading it Hasan only, but... And if he means a weakness that negates grading it Hasan at least; then he is a stubborn falsifier; and this - from him - is (a trait we know from Akhzam)! For this Makhzumi, his condition does not reach absolute weakness - as becomes clear to the researcher in his biography -. So I will not prolong the speech by mentioning what was said about him, but I will quote the words of some critics who encompassed the sayings of the early Huffaz about him, and summarized them in few sentences: Al-Dhahabi said in \"Al-Kashif\": \"(Al-Bukhari) said: There is something in his memory, and Ibn Ma'in said: Trustworthy.\"",

However, this Ibn Nafi' has another state that is better than the preceding, as indicated by some Imams: Al-Bukhari said in \"Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir\" (3/213/1): \"His memory is known and denied (inconsistent), and his book is more correct.\" Similar is the saying of Abu Hatim - in what his son narrated from him in \"Al-Jarh\" (5/184) -: \"He is not a Hafiz, he is soft; you know his memory and deny - and in a copy: you know his Hadith and deny -, and his book is more correct.\" And more explicit than that is the saying of Ibn Hibban in \"Al-Thiqat\" (8/348): \"He was correct in book; and if he narrated from his memory he might err.\" Al-Hafiz summarized everything said about the man in few useful words; he said: \"Trustworthy, correct in book, in his memory is softness.\" For that reason, Al-Dhahabi indicated in the beginning of his biography in \"Al-Mizan\" that he is: \"Correct in Hadith,\" and that Muslim used him as proof. And he included him in \"Ma'rifat al-Ruwayah al-Mutakallam fihim bima la Yujib al-Radd\" (130/192). These Huffaz distinguished between his book; so they authenticated it, and his memory; so they softened it with some softening; so (Al-Haddam) ignored all that by saying: \"There is weakness in him\"! Without explaining what he means by it - as previously explained -, and without distinguishing between his book and his memory!! And you have known the reason for his lack of explanation referred to.",

    "text": "As for his lack of distinguishing; the reason is that if he distinguished, he would be obliged to authenticate the Hadith, because he saw in the chain of the Hadith that Al-Hafiz (Ahmad bin Salih) read to him - meaning from his book -; and for that reason Abdul-Haqq Al-Ishbili authenticated it in \"Al-Ahkam\" (2/892). And Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\": \"Its chain is authentic\"; and for that reason I extracted it in \"Sahih Abi Dawud\" (1780). Then the author cited some witnesses for it from the Hadith of Ali, and from two other Mursal paths; and (Al-Haddam) extracted them and weakened them; without benefiting from their aggregate regarding authenticity -, or at least goodness - as is his habit -, while seeing Imam Ibn al-Qayyim commenting on them saying: \"So these two Mursals from these two different aspects indicate the firmness of the Hadith, especially since the one who sent it (narrated it Mursal) used it as proof; and that implies its firmness with him, this is if it were not narrated from connected (Musnad) aspects other than these two, so how about when it has preceded as connected?!\" (Al-Haddam) did not benefit from all this anything to divert him from his destruction; rather he began arguing with falsehood, turning away from the complete words of Ibn al-Qayyim, and commenting on his saying regarding the two Mursals: \"They indicate the firmness of the Hadith\"; saying (1/280): \"Not every Mursal indicates the firmness of another Mursal...\", and ignoring the rest of his words, not stopping at his saying: \"And the one who sent it used it as proof,\" nor his saying: \"And this is if it were not narrated...\" to the end; insisting on ignoring the Musnad of Abu Hurayra in which he placed weakness; and that does not negate its suitability for use as a witness, so how about when upon investigation it is a proof in itself?! So how about when the two Mursals are added to it?! So how about when the Musnad of Ali is added to them?! Al-Diya Al-Maqdisi extracted it in \"Al-Mukhtarah\" - as Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned following his Hadith, and (Al-Haddam) ignored it, and he also saw it attributed in my book \"Tahdhir al-Sajid\" (p. 140) to his manuscript copy",

So let the readers contemplate how much confusion, mixing, and falsehood is in (Al-Haddam's) extraction?!

And (Sulayman) - this one - does not have Abu Al-Zubayr among his Sheikhs; so most likely he received it from someone else, so it is valid for corroboration, otherwise it is a strong follow-up for Ibn Jurayj. And the origin of the Hadith is in Muslim and others from paths from Ibn Jurayj: Abu Al-Zubayr informed me, that he heard Jabir bin Abdullah... with it. And it is noticed regarding (Al-Haddam) - here - what is noticed regarding many of his extractions; which is his breach of scientific honesty, for he concealed the authentication of Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Hakim, and Al-Dhahabi for it, as well as the authentication of Ibn Hibban, and also Al-Tirmidhi's saying: \"And it has been narrated from more than one",

Or Al-Laythi Al-Madani the trustworthy one?

So why did he limit himself to it without this?! The answer is with Imam Waki' bin Al-Jarrah may Allah have mercy on him; he said: \"People of knowledge write what is for them and against them, and people of desires write only what is for them\" (1).

Covering up with some of what was said regarding the narrator! And prioritizing disparagement over validation!

Imam Ahmad indicated this - in a narration from him as in \"Al-Tahdhib\" -: \"There is no harm in him\". So his clinging to the first saying falls!\nThe other; is Abu Hatim's saying: \"Not strong\": This does not mean he is weak, because it does not mean: \"Not strong\" (absolute negation); there is an apparent difference between this and what he said among people of knowledge, and supporting it is that he was asked: How is his Hadith? He said: \"Salih (righteous), he is layyin (soft) in Hadith\". This means he is intermediate Hasan in Hadith, and Abu Hatim's interpretation of his saying: \"Salih\"; that it means Hasan in Hadith, preceded. So his clinging to this second saying falls - also -! And it became clear that he has no basis for placing weakness in this Abdur-Rahman, and that his Hadith is Hasan according to these two Imams.\nEven conceding, it is opposed by the majority's validation of him, among them Imam Al-Bukhari, for he used the narration of this Abdur-Rahman from Huzayl as proof in \"Al-Sahih\" - as in \"Tahdhib Al-Mizzi\" - and others -. Al-Dhahabi said in his biography from \"Al-Kashif\": \"Trustworthy\". And Al-Hafiz said: \"Truthful; might oppose\".",

Let readers contemplate with me the sayings of some validators of Bahz bin Hakim from early and late scholars; the reality of the man will become clear to them!\nIbn Ma'in was asked about him? He said: \"Authentic chain; if what is below Bahz is trustworthy\". And Ahmad and Ishaq used to use him as proof. Some spoke about him without proof, therefore Hafizs who stood upon him validated him: Al-Dhahabi said in \"Al-Kashif\": \"A group validated him, Ibn Adi said: I did not see a denounced Hadith for him\". He said in \"Tarikh Al-Islam\" - having refuted some who spoke about him -: \"And his Hadith is close to authenticity\". He said in \"Al-Mughni\": \"Truthful with softness, and his Hadith is Hasan, Ibn al-Madini, Ibn Ma'in, and Al-Nasa'i validated him...\". Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Taqrib\": \"Truthful\". So (the Destroyer's) saying: (Grading his Hadith Hasan is not tolerated)! Is what is not tolerated; and is thrown against the wall.",

It is referenced in \"Al-Jilbab\" (183/1).

To magnify the act!! And delude readers that Qais's book was available to people, anyone inserts into it whatever he wants! Of what is not from Qais's Hadith! This is false having no basis, and what scholars mentioned is that that was from the action of a son of his, when he became old. Al-Hafiz said: \"Truthful, changed when he aged, and his son inserted upon him what is not of his Hadith\".\nI noticed that Hafiz Al-Dhahabi may Allah have mercy on him did not address mentioning this (Insertion) at all in the biography of (Qais) in all his books in which he wrote his biography - of what I stood upon -, like: \"Tadhkirat Al-Huffaz\", \"Al-Siyar\", \"Al-Kashif\", and \"Al-Mughni\", except in \"Al-Mizan\" in which he mentions - usually - all what was said about the biographer of disparagement and validation, yet, as if he pointed in the beginning of his biography that nothing results from it more than his saying - therein -: \"Truthful in himself, bad in memory\". Likewise he said in \"Al-Mughni\", and he summarizes in it - usually - what he mentioned in \"Al-Mizan\"; as if he means he was afflicted from his son's side due to his bad memory, and based on that",

Perhaps because of this: He graded the chain of this Hadith - itself - good in \"Talkhis Al-Ilal Al-Mutanahiyah\" (581), and praise be to Allah.\nHere is Abu Hatim Al-Razi - known for his strictness in disparagement - saying regarding this (Qais): \"His place is truthfulness, and he is not strong, his Hadith is written, and not used as proof, and he is more beloved to me than Muhammad bin Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Layla\".\nI say: So he did not weaken him severely; rather indicated using him as witness by saying: \"His Hadith is written\"; and this is what (the Destroyer) does not understand; due to his ignorance of the intents of Imams' sayings. Ibn al-Qayyim pointed to that - as will come -; see the same Hadith number (124).\nAs for Ibn Adi, he graded his Hadith Hasan, saying at the end of his biography from \"Al-Kamil\" - after citing his son's story -: \"Most of his narrations are straight, and he narrated from Shu'bah, and from Ibn Uyaynah - and others -, and that indicates that he is a man of Hadith, and the saying regarding him is what Shu'bah said, that there is no harm in him\".\nI say: So there is no wonder - after this - that Al-Tirmidhi grades this Hadith of his Hasan, especially since Sharik bin Abdullah the Judge was coupled with him - and Muslim used him as witness -, and that Al-Hakim, and Al-Dhahabi authenticate it, and that scholars use it as proof without known disagreement among them,",

As for his faulting it with (Talq bin Ghannam); that is because he is not known to him, therefore he did not mention in his biography validation nor disparagement, so then; the defect is not damaging according to us, because a group validated him, and Al-Bukhari used him as proof in his \"Sahih\", moreover it is possible that his intent by denouncement is merely uniqueness (Tafarrud), not weakening, and this is a known usage among some Muhaddithin - as in \"Muqaddimat Ibn Al-Salah\" - and others -, and the complete phrase of Ibn Abi Hatim supports this interpretation, perhaps - therefore - (the Destroyer) truncated it and did not mention it completely; misleading - as is his habit -!\nIbn Abi Hatim said, from his father regarding (Talq): \"And he narrated a denounced Hadith from Sharik and Qais\"; so he cited it, and said: \"My father said: And no one narrated this Hadith other than him\".

He is Amr bin Awn Al-Wasiti: Khalid bin Abdullah narrated to us... with it, Abu Awana extracted it in his \"Sahih\" (4/460).\nAnd what does he say - also - about the rest of the paths and witnesses which speech prolongs by mentioning, and I mentioned many good ones of them in \"Al-Sahihah\" (3089), and among them the Hadith of Arfajah may Allah be pleased with him, he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah peace and blessings be upon him say: \"Whoever comes to you while your affair is united upon one man, wanting to split your staff, or divide your community: Kill him\". Muslim, Abu Awana, and Ibn Hibban extracted it in their \"Sahihs\", and it is referenced in \"Al-Irwa\" (8/105).\nLike it is his saying peace and blessings be upon him the Hadith of Ibn Amr - the long one -: \"...And whoever pledges allegiance to an Imam, giving him the clasp of his hand, and the fruit of his heart; let him obey him as much as he can; if another comes disputing with him; strike the neck of the other\".

Explanation of that is from several aspects:\nFirst: That the (Trustworthiness) he mentioned; is among what Hafizs differed in, he - as is his habit - takes from their sayings what he wills; what agrees with his desire: Hafiz Ibn Rajab said in \"Sharh Ilal Al-Tirmidhi\" - and it is one of the Weakener's references! - after relating some sayings regarding (Trustworthiness) - mentioned (p. 342) -: \"And Imam Ahmad had a bad opinion of Yunus bin Yazid...\".

For Abdul-Wahhab bin Abi Bakr, and Salih bin Kaysan also opposed him, and their narrations are referenced with authentic chains from them in \"Al-Sahihah\" number (545).\nThen I found a fourth follower for them; who is more trustworthy than them and Yunus all, namely (Al-Zubaydi: Muhammad bin Al-Walid): Al-Nasa'i extracted his Hadith in \"Al-Sunan Al-Kubra\" (5/351/9123): Kathir bin Ubayd Al-Homsi informed us, he said: Muhammad bin Harb narrated to us, from him, from Al-Zuhri... with it.

    "text": "the first path, and (Abd al-Rahim) and (Sahl) in the other path: \"There is weakness in him\"! I say: This is from his cunning and malice upon which he proceeded in weakening authentic hadiths. We have mentioned repeatedly that every hadith with a Hasan chain was not Hasan except because there is weakness in it, otherwise it would be Sahih (authentic). This is the nature of the hadiths that (Al-Haddam) grades as Hasan - despite their scarcity -. Therefore; his saying regarding each one of these narrators: \"There is weakness in him\"; only indicates that he is Hasan al-Hadith! If only he knew what he was saying!! Then he does not know the difference between the narration of Abd al-Rahim from Sahl, and the narration of Zabban from him. Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Taqrib\" in the biography of (Sahl bin Mu'adh): \"There is no harm in him, except in the narration of Zabban from him.\" And (Al-Haddam) confused the two narrations from Sahl, and did not distinguish between them; due to his ignorance of the conditions of the narrators, and the exclusivity of one of them with the Sheikh over the others! Then (Al-Haddam) did not suffice with his previous saying regarding (Al-Qasim bin Abd al-Rahman), but added, saying: \"And some of them do not affirm hearing for him from Abu Umamah\"! I say: This (Some) has no existence except in the mind of (Al-Haddam), and perhaps he means himself, and that is not far-fetched for an arrogant ignoramus accustomed to arrogance and denying facts; for the Imams have agreed on affirming his hearing from him, including Al-Bukhari in \"Al-Tarikh\". Rather, Al-Dhahabi said in \"Al-Kashif\" - after mentioning his narration from Mu'awiyah and Amr bin Abasa -: \"And it was said: He did not hear from a Companion other than Abu Umamah.\" Everyone who wrote his biography asserted his hearing from him; such as Al-Mizzi and Al-Asqalani - and others -; and he has in \"Al-Musnad\" (5/264), \"Al-Ruyani\" (Folio 200/2), and \"Kabir al-Tabarani\"",

As for falsehood, he gave the illusion to the readers that his mentioned authentication is in 'Al-Ihsan'; while the reality is contrary to it. For he [Ibn Hibban/The editor of Ihsan] strengthened the chain of Abu Hurayrah via the group by itself, and authenticated another chain from him, and also strengthened the chain of its witness from the hadith of Ibn Amr! And in all of that, there is a view [reservation] in my opinion, which I clarified in 'Al-Irwa' (3/381-385), and I extracted them - more simply than in 'Al-Ihsan' - along with two other witnesses that were not extracted in it, one of them from a man from Banu Bilal who heard it from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and its chain is good (Jayyid). As for the injustice, it is that he only derived the authenticity he mentioned from the sum of these four hadiths, so justice and fairness required him to refer to 'Al-Irwa', so as not to fall into violation of His saying - the Exalted -: {And do not deprive people of their due things}. 134 - Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned the Angels, saying: \"The heaven has creaked [groaned] because of them, and it has the right to creak; there is no place of four fingers in it except there is an angel standing, bowing, or prostrating.\" And \"Seventy thousand angels enter the Frequented House [Al-Bayt Al-Ma'mur] every day, never returning to it, [this is] the last of their duty toward it.\"",

And the weakening of dozens of authentic hadiths! My assumption is that this was before his ignorance of this noble science became clear to him, and his setting himself up to oppose the scholars of Hadith and their Imams, and contradicting them in their rulings; so he is in one rank, and they are in another!! In what preceded - and what is to come - is the greatest proof of that, such that it leaves no doubt or suspicion in the heart of anyone who (might) still think well of him - due to his pedantry - that he is deviant from the path of the scholars. And here he is now presenting a new example of what we mentioned; and here is the explanation: First, he imagined - due to his ignorance of the Sunnah - that the Hadith of Creaking (Atit) and the Hadith of the Frequented House are one hadith; therefore he placed the commentary number at the end of the Hadith of the House, and weakened it, while the Hadith of the House is authentic and agreed upon between the Two Sheikhs [Bukhari and Muslim] - as will come -. He has much of such confusion, and perhaps some of it preceded - or will come -. Why do we go far?! Here is the example in what he referred to from \"his Riyad\", and he refers to the hadith he included in \"his appendix\" (p. 512): \"14 - Hadith of Abu Dharr: I see what you do not see, and I hear what you do not hear, the heaven creaked...\" so he mentioned it in its entirety - as it is in \"Al-Sahihah\" (1722) -. It contains four paragraphs, which I see as [part of] advice to detail, and to clarify (Al-Haddam's) stance towards them, and the extent of his crime against most of them; for the sake of one of them!

He restricted the weakening to its length, and its implication is that part of it is authentic, and he supported it by saying: \"and parts of it have witnesses\", but he concealed them and did not clarify what they are!! Thereby the reader remains confused; because (Al-Haddam) intended that by not distinguishing what is authentic from it from what is not! As if the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \"Religion is advice...\" is not valid to him, otherwise he would not have concealed the truth, and would have hastened to clarify it, especially since most of the hadith is authentic - if I don't say: all of it - as will come. In that case, what is the benefit of the mentioned weakening except destruction?! As for the first sentence: It is authentic with its witnesses, among which is the hadith of Hakim bin Hizam with an authentic chain, as I clarified in \"Al-Sahihah\" (852 and 1060).

Nor its weakness! And he who lacks a thing cannot give it!! As for the second sentence; it is in the \"Two Sahihs\" from the hadith of Anas, and in \"Al-Bukhari\" - also - from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and they are extracted in \"Al-Sahihah\" (3194), and \"Fiqh al-Seerah\" (479).

Rather, in \"Tahdhib Ibn Hajar\" from Al-Nasa'i - regarding him - is his saying: \"Salih\" (Righteous/Good). Second: He ignored - also - the authentication of Ibn Hibban, Al-Hakim, and Al-Dhahabi, just as he ignored the grading of Hasan by Al-Tirmidhi and Al-Baghawi, so he did not mention it from them - as is his habit -! Third: He relied on Ibn Hibban's saying regarding (Musa): \"And he used to err\"; giving the illusion that this is a weakening from Ibn Hibban for Musa, and it is not so, as is known to those who study this saying of Ibn Hibban. For he only implies that he is average, Hasan al-Hadith (good in hadith).

Fourth: He did not enclose the mentioned saying of Ibn Hibban between double quotation marks as is the terminology today: \" \"; rather he followed it with his saying: \"and what appears...\", giving the understanding - and illusion - that it is from the completion of Ibn Hibban's speech!

The second hadith: \"The Fire will not touch a Muslim who saw me, or saw one who saw me.\" And the third: \"Allah never spoke to anyone except from behind a veil, and He spoke to your father directly (kifahan).\" I say: And all three are in Al-Tirmidhi, and he said regarding each one of them: \"A Hasan Gharib (strange) hadith,\" and a number of scholars confirmed him on that; Al-Mizzi in \"Al-Tahdhib\" (13/393-395); and mention has preceded of those who authenticated and graded it Hasan before him. As for the second hadith: Along with Al-Tirmidhi and Al-Mizzi grading it Hasan - as I mentioned just now - it has a witness from the hadith of Uqbah Abu Abd al-Rahman Al-Juhani - in Ibn Abi Asim in \"Al-Sunnah\" (2/630/1485), and Al-Tabarani in \"Al-Kabir\" (17/357/983), and \"Al-Awsat\" (1/57/1011) via the path of Abd al-Rahman bin Uqbah, from his father... raised - similar to it -. But this Abd al-Rahman, I did not find a biography for him, nor for the narrator from him Nafi' bin Sayfi, and Al-Haythami pointed to them saying (10/21) after attributing it",

Second: His saying: \"capable of being Hasan\"; this is from his bias and crime against trustworthy narrators, paving the way to weaken the hadith; for the men of the mentioned chain are all trustworthy, therefore Al-Hakim authenticated it, and Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, and (Al-Haddam) concealed that - as is his habit -. There is no one among them spoken of except Yunus bin Abi Ishaq, and there is slight speech regarding him that does not harm, for Muslim used him as proof, and Ibn Hibban authenticated more than one hadith for him, and Al-Dhahabi mentioned him in \"Those who were spoken of but are trustworthy\", and said in \"Al-Mizan\": \"Truthful, there is no harm in him, he is not in the strength of Mis'ar nor Shu'ba.\" Someone like him is Hasan al-Hadith - at least -, which Al-Hafiz explicitly stated - as will come -, therefore he remained silent about the hadith in \"Al-Fath\", and confirmed Al-Hakim's authentication of it (11/147). Third: (Al-Haddam) was not satisfied even with the capability he claimed, for he rejected it by saying: \"Were it not for what Al-Tirmidhi mentioned following it...\" etc., so he weakened it due to interruption, imitating Al-Tirmidhi in his saying: That more than one person narrated the hadith from Yunus disconnectedly, without mentioning: \"from his father\"! So he sufficed with imitation here; because it agreed with a desire in himself, which is weakening the hadith without right, otherwise why did he not look into whom Al-Tirmidhi referred to by saying: \"more than one person\"; who are they?! What is their number?! What is their status?! And are they valid - or is he valid - to oppose the paths that connected the hadith, which he pointed to - as preceded -?!

Conversely, he knows the two whom Al-Tirmidhi named, and he knows a third trustworthy narrator who shared with them in the narration of connection, who is (Ismail bin Umar), in the narration of Ahmad, and (Muhammad bin Ubayd Al-Tanafisi) the trustworthy Hafiz followed them in Al-Bayhaqi in \"Al-Shu'ab\" (1/432). These are four trustworthy narrators who connected it by mentioning in their chain - from Yunus -: \"from his father\", so how was it permissible for Al-Haddam to ignore these and prefer the narration of those who contradicted them while he does not know them?! By Allah, it is one of the great [calamities]! Therefore, Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar did not turn to it, so he said - as in \"Sharh al-Adhkar\" (4/110) -: \"A Hasan hadith\", until he said: \"And Al-Tirmidhi said: That some of them narrated it Mursal\", Al-Hafiz said: \"And I found for it from Sa'd two other paths, one abbreviated, extracted by Abu Ya'la and Ibn Abi Asim, and the second lengthy, extracted by Al-Hakim.\" I say: The abbreviated is in Abu Ya'la in his \"Musnad\" (2/65 / 707) with a weak chain, and it is in Al-Bazzar (4/42/ 3149) lengthy. And the lengthy one in Al-Hakim (1/505 - 506) is very weak, so it is not cited as witness, and its text contains denouncement, and I extracted it in \"Al-Da'ifah\" number (5519). Then (Al-Haddam) ignored the follow-up that he mentioned for Yunus from Muhammad bin Muhajir Al-Qurashi, and he - even if Al-Bukhari weakened him by saying: \"He is not followed in his hadith\" - does not harm him here, because he has been followed - as you see -, especially since Ibn Hibban authenticated him (7/413 and 415), and a group of trustworthy narrators narrated from him. Yes; the narrator from him (Ubayd bin Muhammad) was not weakened except by Ibn Adi by saying: \"He has denounced hadiths; he narrates them from Ibn Abi Dhi'b and others.\"",

And Sahl having some error does not necessitate rejecting his hadith, and (Al-Haddam) no matter how much he argues cannot deny that he has some (!) error! So is his entire hadith rejected?!

For Abu Hatim said regarding this (Ja'far): \"Salih\" (Righteous/Good). Ibn Ma'in said likewise in a narration.

And the other is that the other flaw remained: (Confusion), and I strove to find what removes it, like the narration of Sufyan and Shu'bah and their likes, from those who narrated from him before the confusion, but I have not succeeded until now, therefore when I extracted the hadith in \"Takhrij Fiqh al-Seerah\" (p. 251 and 260 - Dar al-Qalam), then in \"Sahih Abi Dawud\" (2390); I strengthened the hadith with some witnesses, from the hadith of Ibn Abbas authenticated by Al-Hakim and Al-Dhahabi, and Al-Hafiz remained silent about it in \"Al-Fath\", and from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, and its men are trustworthy.

And it is a strong witness to his obstinacy and opposing the Imams with falsehood, for I have mentioned more than once that the narrator having: \"weakness in him\" does not make his hadith weak, but rather it is Hasan at least, which is what I ruled in \"Al-Sahihah\" (1/56 - 57 - First Edition), so he opposed me - as is his habit - with this saying of his, which is a proof against him; otherwise what is the difference for him between Sahih and Hasan?!",

As for the hadith of Ibn Sirin, it is the one whose authenticity was previously explained from the narration of Muslim and Al-Tabari from the narration of Yahya bin Habib. So reflect on how much confusion and misleading is in the extraction of this (Destroyer) - despite its small size -?! 156 - \"And Abu Dawud narrated in his 'Sunan' from Ibn Umar, he said: A group of Jews came, and invited the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Al-Quff (1), so he came to them in the house of schools (Bayt al-Madaris) (2), and they said: O Abu Al-Qasim! A man among us committed adultery with a woman so judge, so they placed a cushion for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he sat on it, then said: 'Bring me the Torah', so it was brought, and he removed the cushion from under him, and placed the Torah on it, then said: 'I believed in you and in the One who revealed you', then he said: 'Bring me the most knowledgeable among you', so a young man was brought... then he mentioned the story of stoning.\" (Al-Haddam) weakened its chain (2/410), without explaining the reason - as is his habit! - forcing his ignorance on his readers -, and there is nothing in its chain necessitating calling it weak absolutely; for it is from the narration of Hisham bin Sa'd, that Zayd bin Aslam told him, from Ibn Umar; and its men are all",

    "text": "trustworthy, and in Hisham bin Sa'd there is slight speech that does not lower his hadith from the rank of Hasan. And that is what the speech of the Huffaz implies; like Al-Dhahabi; for he said in \"Al-Mughni\": \"Truthful, famous\", then mentioned some of what was said about him. And Al-Hafiz said: \"Truthful, has delusions.\" Rather Al-Dhahabi explicitly stated what I said: saying in \"Al-Kashif\" - after recounting some of what was said about him -: \"I say: Hasan al-Hadith\", and likewise he said in \"Narrators spoken of with criticism that does not warrant rejection\" (182 - 183). So there is no surprise - then - in Al-Hafiz strengthening the hadith by remaining silent about it in \"Al-Fath\" (12/168); as is his rule, therefore I graded it Hasan in \"Al-Irwa\" (5/94). Rather the hadith is authentic... for Abu Dawud said - regarding Hisham bin Sa'd -: \"He is trustworthy, the most firm of people regarding Zayd bin Aslam.\" All these facts, (Al-Haddam) ignored them for the sake of spreading his desire in weakening hadiths, may Allah treat him as he deserves! 157 - \"He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to boast saying: 'I am the son of the two sacrificed ones'; meaning: his father Abdullah, and his grandfather Isma'il\": The Ignoramus said (2/414): \"With this wording in 'Al-Kashshaf' by Al-Zamakhshari, as Al-Ajluni mentioned (1/199), and Al-Hakim also mentioned it - with it - in his 'Mustadrak' (2/559), and did not provide a chain for it, and Ibn Hajar attributed it in 'Al-Fath' (12/378) to",

For even if they extracted the hadith or provided a chain for it, that would not benefit anything except by clarifying the condition of its chain, so how about when they suspended it, and did not mention a chain for it?! And if Al-Hakim had provided a chain and authenticated it even with a Hasan chain, he would have hastened to refute him and preface it with his saying: \"Its chain is weak\" - as is his habit! - So what happened - here - that he departed from his habit, and obscured for the readers the reality of this hadith, and that it has no origin?! Nothing but quarrelsomeness and opposition which he kneaded himself with, and proceeded upon - as you saw in what preceded in all his extractions -; for he saw me prefacing the hadith with my saying: \"It has no origin with this wording\", in \"Silsilat al-Ahadith al-Da'ifah\" number (331), then I extracted it in detail in two pages from the narration of Al-Hakim suspended with this wording, and connected from the hadith of Mu'awiyah with the flimsy wording, and from my mentioned extraction; (Al-Haddam) presented the summary mentioned above! And it is a dark summary with no light in it, for it was obligatory on him to state explicitly that the mentioned wording has no origin - as I did -, but the love of quarrelsomeness and opposition prevented him from that, and appearing in the guise of the independent researcher who does not imitate (!), while in reality he does not even do well as a (blind follower) of the people of knowledge! Due to his vanity and arrogance!! We ask Allah for safety.",
