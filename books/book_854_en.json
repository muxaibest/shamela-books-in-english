We seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our souls and the consequences of our deeds. Whomever Allah guides, none can misguide; and whomever He allows to go astray, none can guide. I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. {O you who believe, fear Allah as He should be feared, and do not die except as Muslims} [Al-Imran: 102]. {O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both many men and women. And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed Allah is ever watchful over you} [An-Nisa: 1]. {O you who believe, fear Allah and speak words of sincere guidance. He will correct your deeds and forgive your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly attained a great success} [Al-Ahzab: 70-71]. As for what follows: the truest speech is the Book of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad ﷺ. The worst of matters are their innovations; every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance leads to the Fire. Allah Almighty said: {Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent} [Al-Mulk: 1], {He who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deed, and He is the Almighty, the Forgiving} [Al-Mulk: 2].",

And it was from his guidance in funerals to establish servitude to the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, in the most perfect manner, and kindness to the deceased, preparing him for Allah in the best and most excellent condition, and his standing and the standing of his companions in rows praising Allah, seeking forgiveness for him, asking for forgiveness, mercy, and overlooking for him.

One of my dear friends asked me, on the occasion of the death of one of his female relatives on Friday, 11 Rabi' al-Thani, 1373 AH, to write a brief treatise on \"The Etiquette of Funerals in Islam,\" so that he or someone else could print and distribute it to those gathered for condolences during their customary days, seizing the opportunity of their gathering to introduce them to the Sunnah of their Prophet so that they may follow it, be guided by its guidance, and be enlightened by its light. Although I had started writing some other works, I promised him good, due to the cooperation in reviving the Sunnah and killing innovation involved in that. So I hastened to fulfill his wish and accomplish his request. But I had hardly started doing so when it became clear to me that the matter was further than being achieved with that speed, and broader than being collected in a treatise distributed to people on such an occasion. That is because the etiquette and rules of funerals are very numerous, and a large part of them are matters on which scholars' opinions differed and views conflicted. Some prohibit a thing while another permits it, and some obligate a thing while another does not allow it, and some...",
    "foot_note": "1. = Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah say: The guidance of our Prophet (peace be upon him) was more perfect than the guidance of this gnostic. He gave servitude its due right, so his heart expanded for pleasure with Allah and mercy for the child and tenderness towards him. So he praised Allah and was pleased with Him in His decree, and wept out of mercy and compassion. So compassion led him to weep, and his servitude to Allah and love for Allah led him to pleasure and praise. This gnostic's heart was too narrow to combine the two matters and his inner self did not expand to witness them both and uphold them both, so the servitude of pleasure distracted him from the servitude of mercy and compassion\".",

Therefore, it was necessary first of all to collect the individual issues of \"Funerals,\" then study them meticulously, track the evidences of the disputed ones, critique them in the light of the sciences of \"Principles of Hadith\" and \"Principles of Jurisprudence,\" and choose the preponderant one among them, without any bias towards a specific school of thought (Madhhab) or being influenced by a custom that has dominated until it became as if it were a religion that must be followed! It is not hidden from the people of knowledge who practiced authorship that accomplishing such a work requires diligent pursuit, profound effort, beautiful patience, and a long time. After its completion, the requested treatise can be authored in a form that reassures the soul, expands the chest, and maximizes the benefit. Therefore, I mentioned a summary of this to the brother referred to, apologizing. He accepted my excuse, may Allah reward him with good, but he returned asking me to start this work, urged me to do it, and insisted on it, hoping for much good from it. So I sought Allah's guidance (Istikhara), and dedicated myself to study and review for nearly three months, working night and day, except for what was necessary of work in my profession and sleep indispensable for my body's rest, until I was able to prepare this book which is in the hands of the honorable reader. It would have required more time than was estimated for it, were it not that a large part of its issues and Hadiths had been verified by me in some of my other compilations, and that is why you see me referring to them in some places in it.",

I included in its beginning some chapters and issues that are not usually mentioned in the \"Chapter of Funerals\" in general books of Fiqh, such as the Will (Wasiyyah), signs of a good ending, and the like. Some of it might not be mentioned in them at all, such as Chapter (5, 8, and 9), Issue (30), Paragraph (C and D) of Issue (74), Issues (98, 105, 99, 107, 113, and 125), and Paragraph (7) of Issue (128) despite its importance and the frequent affliction of people with it, and the Mutawatir Hadiths concerning it, and Paragraph (10) of it. I was inspired by reality for its arrangement, so I opened it with a chapter: (1 - What is obligatory upon the sick person) regarding satisfaction with the Decree, patience with Destiny, abandoning wishing for death, fulfilling rights, making a will and witnessing to it... Then: (2 - Prompting the dying person) and what is upon those present regarding prompting him and commanding him with the Testimony (Shahada). Then (3 - What is upon those present after his death) regarding closing his eyes, supplicating for him, covering him, hastening his preparation, and rushing to pay off his debt.

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to him: O Uncle! Do not wish for death.

And if you are an evildoer, then being delayed allows you to seek favor [repent] from your evil, which is better for you. So do not wish for death.\" Extracted by Al-Hakim (1/339) and he said: \"Authentic according to the conditions of the two Sheikhs (Bukhari and Muslim)\" and Al-Dhahabi agreed. But it is only according to the condition of Al-Bukhari. The two Sheikhs and Al-Bayhaqi (3/377) and others extracted from the Hadith of Anas raised (Marfu') similar to it, and in it: \"If he must do so, let him say: O Allah, keep me alive as long as life is good for me, and cause me to die if death is good for me.\"\n4 - If he has rights [owed to others] upon him, let him fulfill them to their owners, if that is easy for him.

If he has righteous deeds, they will be taken from him and given to his companion. And if he has no righteous deeds, some of the bad deeds of his companion will be taken and cast upon him.\" Extracted by Al-Bukhari and Al-Bayhaqi (3/369) and others. And he (peace be upon him) said: \"Do you know who the bankrupt is? They said: The bankrupt among us is the one who has no dirhams and no goods. He said: The bankrupt of my Ummah is the one who comes on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting, and zakat, but he comes having insulted this one, slandered this one, consumed the wealth of this one, shed the blood of this one, and beaten this one.

The first is authentic as Al-Hakim said and Al-Dhahabi agreed, and the second is Hasan as Al-Mundhiri said (3/34). And Al-Tabarani narrated it in Al-Kabir with the wording: \"Debt is of two types: whoever dies intending to pay it off, I am his guardian. And whoever dies not intending to pay it off, that is the one from whom good deeds will be taken; there will be no dinar or dirham on that Day (1)\". And Jabir bin Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: \"When Uhud approached, my father called me at night and said: I do not see myself but being killed among the first of those killed from the companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and I am not leaving behind me anyone dearer to me than you except the soul of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). I have a debt, so pay it off, and treat your sisters well. We reached the morning, and he was the first to be killed...\" The Hadith. Extracted by Al-Bukhari.\n5 - It is necessary to hasten with such a will, due to his saying (peace be upon him): \"It is not the right of a Muslim person who spends two nights and has something he wants to make a will about, except that his will is written by his head.\" Ibn Umar said: \"No night has passed me since I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say that except that I have my will.\" Narrated by the two Sheikhs and the authors of the Sunan and others.\n6 - He must make a will for his relatives who do not inherit from him, due to the saying of Allah the Blessed and Exalted: {Prescribed for you when death approaches [any] one of you if he leaves wealth [is that he should make] a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous.} [Al-Baqarah: 180]\n7 - He is allowed to bequeath one-third of his wealth, and it is not permissible to exceed it; rather, it is better to decrease from it, due to the Hadith of Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:",

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) visited me, so I said: O Messenger of Allah, I have much wealth, and no one inherits from me except a daughter of mine. Shall I bequeath two-thirds of my wealth? He said: No. I said: Half of my wealth? He said: No. I said: Then a third of my wealth? He said: The third, and the third is much. Indeed, O Sa'd! That you leave your heirs rich is better for you than leaving them dependent, begging from people (and he gestured with his hand). Indeed, O Sa'd, you will never spend a spending seeking thereby the Face of Allah except that you will be rewarded for it, even the morsel you place in your wife's mouth. (He said: So after that, the third became permissible)\". Extracted by Ahmad (1524) and the context is his, the two Sheikhs, and the two additions are for Muslim and the authors of the Sunan. Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I wished that people would reduce from the third to the fourth in wills, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The third is much.\" Extracted by Ahmad (2029, 2076), the two Sheikhs, Al-Bayhaqi (6/269), and others.\n8 - And two just Muslim men should witness that. If they are not found, then two men from non-Muslims, provided that their testimony is verified upon doubt according to the explanation mentioned in the saying of Allah the Blessed and Exalted: {O you who have believed, testimony [should be taken] among you when death approaches one of you at the time of bequest - [that of] two just men from among you or two others from outside if you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death strikes you. Detain them after the prayer and let them both swear by Allah if you doubt [their testimony, saying], \"We will not exchange our oath for a price, even if he should be a near relative, and we will not withhold the testimony of Allah.

(1) Meaning: If it happens that it is discovered that the two swearing witnesses deserved sin by lying and concealing in the testimony, or by treachery and concealing some of the estate when entrusted with it, then the obligatory action, or what is done to establish the truth, is that the oath is returned to the heirs by having two other men stand in their place from the relatives of the deceased who inherit from him, those against whom that sin was committed by the crime against them and treachery towards them.

And fear Allah and listen; and Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people (108)} [Al-Ma'idah: 106 - 108]\n9 - As for the will for parents and relatives who inherit from the testator, it is not permissible, because it is abrogated by the verse of inheritance. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) explained that most clearly in his sermon during the Farewell Pilgrimage, saying: \"Indeed, Allah has given everyone who has a right his right, so there is no will for an heir\" (1). Extracted by Abu Dawood, Al-Tirmidhi who classified it as Hasan, and Al-Bayhaqi (6/264) who indicated its strengthening, and he was correct, for its chain is Hasan, and it has many supporting evidences in Al-Bayhaqi and \"Majma' al-Zawa'id\" (4/212).\n10 - Harming in the will is prohibited, such as bequeathing to deprive some heirs of their right to inheritance, or preferring some over others in it, due to the saying of Allah the Blessed and Exalted: {(For men is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave... be it little or much - an obligatory share...)} [Al-Nisa: 7] and in the last of them: {(...after any bequest he [may have] made or debt, not being harmful... A command from Allah, and Allah is Knowing and Forbearing)} [Al-Nisa: 12]. And due to his saying (peace be upon him): \"There should be no harming and no reciprocating harm. Whoever harms, Allah will harm him, and whoever causes difficulty, Allah will cause difficulty for him.\" Extracted by Al-Daraqutni (522) and Al-Hakim (2/57-58) from Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri. Al-Dhahabi agreed with Al-Hakim on his statement \"Authentic according to the condition of Muslim,\" but the truth is that it is a Hasan Hadith as Al-Nawawi said in \"Al-Arba'in\" and Ibn Taymiyyah in \"Al-Fatawa\" (3/262) due to its many paths and supporting evidences. Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab mentioned them in \"Sharh Al-Arba'in\" (p. 219, 220), then I extracted it in \"Irwa' al-Ghalil\" No. 888).",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) So the abrogator is the Quran, and the Sunnah is merely clarifying that as we mentioned, and as is clear from his sermon (peace be upon him), contrary to what many think that the Hadith is the abrogator. Then some contemporaries exploited that and claimed that Ahad Hadith abrogates the Quran. You have known the answer, which is that the abrogator is only the Quran. Even if we concede that the abrogator is the Hadith, it is suitable for abrogation by consensus, because all scholars accepted it. Moreover, it is a Mutawatir Hadith, as known by anyone who has examined its many paths scattered in the collections and Musnads of Sunnah. Perhaps we will be successful in extracting them and verifying the discussion on them in a separate volume. Then I collected its paths and extracted them in \"Irwa' al-Ghalil\" No. (16), and its paths exceeded ten, from eight Companions, some authentic, some Hasan, and some whose weakness is mended.",

Do not follow me with incense burners. Do not place anything on my niche that prevents the dust from reaching me. Do not build a structure over my grave.

Abu Hatim and others weakened him, Al-Azdi said: Matruk (abandoned). Abu Zur'ah said: Munkar al-Hadith (rejected in Hadith).

The context of the Hadith and the second narration are for Al-Bayhaqi, and it and the additions are for Ahmad in a narration.\nSecond: From Samurah bin Jundub: \"That the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed over a funeral (and in a narration: prayed Subh). When he finished, he said: Is there anyone here from the family of so-and-so? (A man said: He is here). He said: A man dragging his Izar stood up from the back of the people (three times no one answered him), (The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him: What prevented you in the first two times from answering me?) Listen, I did not mention your name except for good. Indeed, so-and-so - a man among them - is detained by his debt (from Paradise. If you wish, redeem him, and if you wish, surrender him to the punishment of Allah). If you could see his family and those who investigate his affair, they stood up and paid it off for him, (until no one claimed anything from him)\" (1).

Some of them from Al-Sha'bi from Samurah, and some inserted Sam'an bin Mashnaj between them, and only on the second way is it authentic. The other narration is for the two Musnads.

    "text": "Two Notes:\n1 - This Hadith implies that Abu Qatadah's payment of the debt was after the Prophet's (peace be upon him) prayer over the deceased. This is problematic, as it is authentically reported from Abu Qatadah himself that he paid it before the prayer as will be mentioned in Issue (55) paragraph (F). If the story is not interpreted as multiple incidents, then Abu Qatadah's narration is more authentic than Jabir's Hadith, because it contains Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Aqil, about whom there is discussion, and he is Hasan in Hadith when he does not contradict [others], but with contradiction, he is not a proof. And Allah knows best.\n2 - These Hadiths indicate that the deceased benefits from the debt being paid on his behalf, even if it is from other than his child, and that payment lifts the punishment from him. They are among the specific exceptions to the generality of the saying of Allah the Blessed and Exalted: {And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives} [Al-Najm: 39] and to his saying (peace be upon him): \"When a person dies, his deeds are cut off except from three...\" The Hadith narrated by Muslim, Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, and Ahmad. However, paying on his behalf is one thing and giving charity on his behalf is another. Payment is more specific than charity. Otherwise, the Hadiths narrated regarding giving charity on his behalf refer to the child's charity for the parents, which is from their earning according to the text of the Hadith. So it is not permissible to analogize the stranger to them, because it is an analogy with a difference as is apparent. Nor is charity analogized to payment [of debt], because it is more general than it as we mentioned. Perhaps we will discuss this issue with some detail at the end of the book, God willing.\nFourth Hadith: From Jabir also. \"That his father was martyred on the day of Uhud, and left six daughters, and left a debt of (thirty Wasqs). (The creditors were harsh in demanding their rights). When the time for harvesting the palms came, I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, you know that my father was martyred on the day of Uhud and left much debt, and I would like the creditors to see you. He said: Go and heap every type of date separately. So I did, then I called him. (He came to us when it was morning). When they saw him, they were harsh with me at that moment. When he saw what they were doing, he walked around the largest heap three times (and prayed for blessing in its fruit), then sat on it, then said:",

There is no harm in recounting their story here - despite its length - due to the benefits, admonitions, and lessons in it. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Malik, the father of Anas, said to his wife Umm Sulaym - who is the mother of Anas -: This man - meaning the Prophet (peace be upon him) - prohibits wine. So he left until he came to Sham and died there. Abu Talhah came and proposed to Umm Sulaym, speaking to her about it. She said: O Abu Talhah! One like you is not rejected, but you are a disbelieving man, and I am a Muslim woman, it is not proper for me to marry you! He said: What is that? Your opportunity? She said: And what is my opportunity? He said: Yellow and white [gold and silver]! She said: I do not want yellow or white, I want Islam from you. (If you submit [become Muslim], that is my dowry, and I do not ask you for other than it). He said: Who will do that for me? She said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) will do that for you. So Abu Talhah set off intending the Prophet (peace be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was sitting among his companions. When he saw him, he said: Abu Talhah has come to you with the brightness of Islam between his eyes. He informed the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) what Umm Sulaym said, so he married her on that. Thabit (who is Al-Bunani, one of the narrators of the story from Anas) said: We have not heard of a dowry that was greater than it, that she accepted Islam as a dowry. So he married her. She was a woman with beautiful eyes, in which there was smallness. She was with him until a son was born to him. Abu Talhah loved him intensely. The boy fell sick (intensely sick), and Abu Talhah was humbled by his sickness or weakened by it.",

Abu Talhah went out in the evening to the Prophet (peace be upon him) (and in a narration: to the mosque) and the boy died.

She brought him his dinner (and offered it to them, so they ate, and the people left). (He said: So he went to his bed and laid his head). Then she got up and perfumed herself, (and beautified herself for him better than she used to do before that). (Then she came until she entered the bed with him. As soon as he smelled the scent of perfume, he did what a man does with his wife). (When it was the end of the night) she said: O Abu Talhah, tell me, if a people lent a loan to a people, then asked them for it, did they have the right to withhold it from them? He said: No. She said: Indeed, Allah Almighty lent you your son as a loan, then He took him back to Himself, so seek reward and be patient! He became angry then said: You left me until I fell into what I fell into [intercourse], then you announced my son to me! (So he said Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un, and praised Allah).

    "foot_note": "1. = First: What the majority went to, which is that the Hadith applies to the one who requested wailing over him in his will, or did not advise leaving it while knowing that people usually do it. For this reason, Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak said: \"If he forbade them during his life but they did something of that after his death, nothing is upon him\" (1). And punishment (Adhab) according to them means penalty ('Uqab). Second: That the meaning is \"he feels pain by hearing his family's weeping over him, feels pity for them, and grieves, and that is in the Barzakh (interval between death and resurrection), not on the Day of Resurrection. This was the view of Muhammad bin Jarir Al-Tabari and others, and Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Al-Qayyim, and others supported it. They said: \"The meaning is not that Allah punishes him because of the living's weeping over him. 'Adhab (torment/suffering) is more general than 'Uqab (penalty/punishment), as in his saying: 'Travel is a piece of 'Adhab'. This is not a punishment for a sin, but rather suffering and pain\" (2). This might be supported by his saying in Hadith (5 and 6): \"in his grave\". I used to lean towards this view for a period of time, then it appeared to me that it is weak due to its contradiction with the seventh Hadith which restricted the punishment to being \"on the Day of Resurrection\". It is clear that this cannot be interpreted as they mentioned. Therefore, the preponderant view with us is the view of the majority. There is no contradiction for them between this restriction and the other restriction in his saying \"in his grave\", rather one is added to the other, resulting in that he is punished in his grave and on the Day of Resurrection. And this is clear, God willing. _________ \n1. 'Umdat al-Qari (4/74). \n2.

The last addition is for Al-Nasa'i from him, and its chain is authentic, and the other path has a Hasan chain.\n2 - From Abu Al-Aswad Al-Dili who said: \"I came to Medina while there was a disease in it, and they were dying in great numbers. I sat with Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), and a funeral passed by, and good was spoken of it. Umar said: It is obligatory. I said: What is obligatory, O Commander of the Faithful? He said: I said as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Any Muslim for whom four testify to good, Allah enters him into Paradise.

(1) Know that the sum of these three Hadiths indicates that this testimony is not specific to the Companions, but it is also for those after them from the believers who follow their path in faith, knowledge, and truthfulness. This was asserted by Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar in \"Al-Fath,\" so let whoever wants more explanation refer to his words. Moreover, restricting the testimony to four in the third Hadith, apparently it was before the Hadith of Umar before it, in which the testimony of two suffices, and that is the relied upon [view]. Furthermore, as for people's saying today after the funeral prayer in some countries: \"What do you bear witness regarding him? Bear witness good for him!\" And they answer by saying righteous, or from the people of goodness, and the like, this is definitely not what is meant by the Hadith. Rather, it is an ugly innovation, because it was not from the practice of the Salaf, and because those who testify to that usually do not know the deceased. Indeed, they may testify contrary to what they know in response to the desire of the one asking for the testimony of good, thinking that this benefits the deceased, and being ignorant that the beneficial testimony is only that which conforms to the reality in the soul of the one testifying, as indicated by his saying in the first Hadith \"Indeed, Allah has angels who speak on the tongues of the children of Adam regarding what is in a person of good and evil.\"",

Believing that it indicates the greatness of the deceased is from the superstitions of Jahiliyyah which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) nullified on the day his son Ibrahim (peace be upon him) died, and the sun eclipsed. He addressed the people, praised Allah and extolled Him, then said: \"As to what follows, O people, the people of Jahiliyyah used to say that the sun and the moon do not eclipse except for the death of a great person. Indeed, they are two signs from the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse for the death of anyone nor for his life. But Allah frightens His servants with them. So if you see anything of that, rush to His remembrance, supplication, seeking forgiveness, and to charity, freeing slaves, and prayer in the mosques until it clears.\" This context is picked from a collection of Hadiths I cited in a book of mine on \"Eclipse Prayer\" in which I discussed its paths and wordings, then collected their summary at the end in one context, and this is part of it.

It will come in full with its extraction in the next issue.\n29 - The following matters should be observed in washing him:\nFirst: Washing him three times or more according to what those undertaking his washing see fit.\nSecond: That the washings be odd numbered (Witr).\nThird: That sidr, or what takes its place in cleaning like potash and soap, be combined with some of them.",

While they differed, Allah cast sleep upon them until there was not a man among them except his chin was on his chest. Then a speaker spoke to them from the side of the house, they did not know who he was: Wash the Prophet (peace be upon him) with his clothes on. So they got up to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and washed him while his shirt was on him, pouring water over the shirt and rubbing him with the shirt, not their hands.

Ibn Majah (1/446) narrated from it Aisha's saying at the end: \"If I had known...\" and Ibn Hibban narrated it in his Sahih (2156).\nEleventh: Exempted from what was mentioned in (Fourth) is the Muhrim, for it is not permissible to perfume him due to his saying in the Hadith which was referred to recently: \"Do not apply Hanut to him, and in a narration: And do not perfume him... for he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection reciting Talbiyah.\" Extracted by the Two Sheikhs and others as preceded p. 12-13.\nTwelfth: Also exempted from what was mentioned in (Ninth) are the spouses, for it is permissible for each of them to undertake washing the other, since there is no evidence preventing it, and the default is permissibility, especially since it is supported by two Hadiths:\n1 - From Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) who said:",

Extracted by Ibn Majah, and Abu Dawood and others narrated it at the end of her Hadith mentioned recently regarding the washing of the Prophet (peace be upon him).\n2 - From her also, she said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) returned to me from a funeral in Al-Baqi', and I was feeling a headache in my head, saying: 'O my head!' He said: 'Rather, I, O my head! What harm would it do you if you died before me, so I washed you, shrouded you, then prayed over you and buried you'.\" Extracted by Ahmad (6/228), Al-Darimi (1/37 - 38), Ibn Majah (1/448), Ibn Hisham in \"Al-Sirah\" (2/366 - Bulaq), Al-Daraqutni (192), and Al-Bayhaqi (3/396). In all of their chains is Muhammad bin Ishaq who used 'an'ana [said 'from'], except in Ibn Hisham's narration where he explicitly stated hearing (Tahdith), so the Hadith is proven, and praise be to Allah. However, Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned in \"Al-Talkhis\" (5/125 Muniriyah Edition) that Salih bin Kaysan followed him in it according to Ahmad and Al-Nasa'i. I say: It is in Ahmad (6/144) but it does not contain the explicit mention of washing. So refer to Al-Nasa'i's narration, perhaps it is in it, for I did not see the Hadith in his Minor Sunan, perhaps it is in his Major one.\nThirteenth: That the one who washes him be the most knowledgeable of the Sunnah of washing, especially if he is from his family and relatives, because those who undertook washing him (peace be upon him) were as we mentioned. Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I washed the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and I started looking for what usually comes from the deceased but I saw nothing.

Extracted by Abu Dawood (2/69) and its chain is authentic Mursal. It has a supporting evidence from the Hadith of Ibn Abbas. Extracted by Ahmad (3/358) with a weak chain.\n30 - For the one who undertakes washing him, there is a great reward with two conditions:\nFirst: That he conceals him, and does not speak of what he might see of disliked things, due to his saying (peace be upon him): \"Whoever washes a Muslim and conceals him, Allah forgives him forty times. And whoever digs for him and buries him, he is granted reward like the reward of a dwelling he provided him until the Day of Resurrection.

I suffice here with mentioning six of them:\n1 - The saying of the Blessed and Exalted: {Say, \"I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God.

Thus he whose emigration was to Allah and His Messenger, his emigration was to Allah and His Messenger. And he whose emigration was to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman in marriage, his emigration was to that for which he emigrated.\" Extracted by Al-Bukhari at the beginning of his \"Sahih,\" Muslim, and others from Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him).\n4 - His saying also: \"Give glad tidings to this Ummah of eminence, establishment in the lands, victory, and elevation in religion.

Imam Ahmad indicated this, for Al-Khatib narrated from him that he urged his son Abdullah to write this Hadith.\n32 - It is not prescribed to wash the martyr slain in battle, even if it happens that he was Junub (in a state of major ritual impurity). There are Hadiths regarding this:\nFirst: From Jabir who said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Bury them in their blood - meaning on the day of Uhud - and he did not wash them.

It is not clear to me which of them is intended here. As for Al-Shawkani, he said in \"Nayl al-Awtar\" (4/25): \"It is a narration with no defect.\"",

In this chapter, there is [a report] from Abd al-Rahman bin Awf extracted by Al-Bukhari and others.\n35 - The shroud should be sufficient and ample, covering his entire body, due to the Hadith of Jabir bin Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him): \"That the Prophet (peace be upon him) delivered a sermon one day and mentioned a man from his companions who died and was shrouded in an insufficient shroud, and was buried at night. The Prophet (peace be upon him) rebuked burying a man at night until he is prayed over unless a person is compelled to do that. And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'When one of you shrouds his brother, let him shroud him well (if he is able).'\" Extracted by Muslim (3/50), Ibn Al-Jarud (268), Abu Dawood (2/62), and Ahmad (3/295, 329). The last sentence of it was narrated by Al-Tirmidhi (2/133) and Ibn Majah from the Hadith of Abu Qatadah. Al-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Hadith.\" I say: Rather, it is an authentic Hadith, for its chain from Jabir is authentic (1), so how about when the Hadith of Abu Qatadah is added to it? Siddiq Hasan Khan attributed it in \"Al-Rawdah al-Nadiyyah\" (1/164) to Muslim, which is an error. The addition is Ahmad's in a narration of his.

Because besides lacking evidence, his clothing in life might be precious or poor, so how can his shroud be made of the same type!?\n36 - If the shroud falls short of that, and ample shroud is not available, his head and whatever length of his body possible should be covered with it, and whatever remains exposed should be covered with Idhkhir or other grass. There are two Hadiths concerning this:\nFirst: From Khabbab bin Al-Aratt in the story of Mus'ab regarding his Namirah: \"Place it over his head (and in a narration: cover his head with it) and put Idhkhir over his feet.\" Agreed upon, and it preceded in full in Issue (34), (p. 57).\nSecond: From Harithah bin Mudarrib who said: \"I entered upon Khabbab while he had been cauterized (in his stomach) seven times. He said: Were it not that I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say: 'Let none of you wish for death,' I would have wished for it. I saw myself with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) not possessing a dirham, and now in the corner of my house are forty thousand dirhams! Then his shroud was brought. When he saw it, he wept and said: But Hamzah did not have a shroud except a black-and-white striped garment (Burdah Malha'); if placed on his head it shrank from his feet, and if placed on his feet it shrank from his head, so Idhkhir was placed on his feet.\" Extracted by Ahmad (6/395) with this completeness, and his chain is authentic. And Al-Tirmidhi without his saying: \"Then his shroud was brought...\" and said: \"Hasan Sahih Hadith.\" The Two Sheikhs and others narrated the prohibition of wishing for death from another path. It has a supporting evidence from the Hadith of Anas, which we will mention, God willing, in the next issue.\n37 - If shrouds are scarce and the dead are many, it is permissible to shroud a group of them in one shroud, and the one who knew more Quran among them is placed first towards the Qiblah, due to the Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"When it was the day of Uhud, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed by Hamzah bin Abdul-Muttalib, and he had been mutilated...",

So he shrouded him in a Namirah. (She was) such that if she covered his head his feet appeared, and if she covered his feet his head appeared. So he covered his head. He did not pray over anyone of the martyrs other than him. And he said: I am a witness over you today. (He said: The slain were many and the clothes were few.

Extracted by Abu Dawood (2/59), Al-Tirmidhi (2/138 - 139) who classified it as Hasan, Ibn Sa'd (Vol 3 Part 1 p 8), Al-Hakim (1/365 - 366) and the context is his, and from him Al-Bayhaqi (4/10 - 11), and Ahmad (3/128). The additions are his. Al-Hakim said: \"Authentic according to the condition of Muslim,\" and Al-Dhahabi agreed. But it is only Hasan as preceded in the Third of Issue (32). (p. 53).\n38 - It is not permissible to remove the clothes of the martyr in which he was killed; rather, he is buried while wearing them, due to his saying (peace be upon him) regarding the slain of Uhud: \"Wrap them in their clothes.\" Extracted by Ahmad (5/431) with this wording. In a narration of his: \"Wrap them in their blood.\" Likewise, Al-Nasa'i extracted it (1/282). Al-Shawkani attributed it (4/34) to Abu Dawood which is an error.

The completion of the Hadith indicates this, that he used to ask about the one who knew more Quran and put him first in the Laḥd. If they were all in one garment, he would have asked about the best of them before that so as not to lead to undoing the shrouding and repeating it.\" Mentioned in \"Awn al-Ma'bud\" (3/165). This interpretation is the correct one. As for the saying of those who interpreted it literally, it is wrong and contrary to the context of the story as Ibn Taymiyyah explained. Even further from correctness is the one who said: the meaning of 'one garment' is 'one grave'! Because this is explicitly stated in the Hadith, so there is no meaning to repeating it.",

He said: I did not follow you for this, but I followed you so that I might be shot here - and he pointed to his throat - with an arrow and die, and enter Paradise. He said: If you are truthful with Allah, He will be truthful with you. They stayed for a while, then rose to fight the enemy. He was brought to the Prophet (peace be upon him) carried, having been hit by an arrow where he had pointed. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Is it him? They said: Yes. He said: He was truthful with Allah so He was truthful with him. Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) shrouded him in the Prophet's (peace be upon him) Jubbah (cloak), then put him forward and prayed over him. Among what appeared of his prayer was: O Allah, this is Your servant, he went out as a migrant in Your cause, and was killed as a martyr.

When the Hadith of Abu Hurairah reached him, he said: (Abu Hurairah has narrated too much to us, (and in a narration: he found it too great)). (So he sent Khabbab to Aisha to ask her about Abu Hurairah's statement then return to him and inform him what she said.

He said to her: O Mother of the Believers, I adjure you by Allah, did you hear the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say: (he mentioned the Hadith)? She said: Yes, by Allah. Abu Hurairah said: Indeed, I was not... etc. The apparent meaning of all this contradicts the narration that he sent Khabbab to Ibn Umar. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar reconciled the two narrations by saying that when the messenger returned to Ibn Umar informing him of Aisha['s confirmation], that reached Abu Hurairah, so he walked to Ibn Umar and made him hear that from Aisha directly (face to face).\nAbu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) has another Hadith regarding the virtue of witnessing a funeral.

The first addition is for Al-Nasa'i and the other for Abu Dawood (1).\n54 - As for carrying the funeral on a cart or car designated for funerals, and the mourners escorting it while in cars, this form is not prescribed at all, for several reasons:\nFirst: It is from the customs of the disbelievers, and it is established in Sharia that it is not permissible to imitate them in it. There are very many Hadiths regarding this, which I encompassed and extracted in my book \"Hijab al-Mar'ah al-Muslimah fi al-Kitab wa al-Sunnah\" (The Veil of the Muslim Woman in the Book and the Sunnah), some commanding and urging to differ from them in their acts of worship, dress, and customs, and some from his action (peace be upon him) in differing from them in that. Whoever wishes to view them may refer to it (2).\nSecond: It is an innovation in worship, contradicting the practical Sunnah in carrying the funeral, and everything like that from newly invented matters is misguidance by consensus.\nThird: It misses the purpose of carrying and escorting it, which is remembering the Hereafter, as stated by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in the Hadith mentioned at the beginning of this chapter with the wording:",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) It is explicit that he (peace be upon him) rode upon his return from the funeral. This was hidden from Abu Al-Tayyib Siddiq Hasan Khan, so he used this Hadith as evidence in \"Al-Rawdah\" (1/173) that the follower of the funeral has the choice to walk in front of it or behind it, saying: The Companions were walking around the funeral of Ibn al-Dahdah! This is an error from two aspects: First: There is nothing in the Hadith mentioning what he said. Rather, it is explicit that they were walking around the Prophet (peace be upon him), and there is no correlation between the two matters as is apparent. Second: That was sufficient when leaving the funeral as preceded. Perhaps the cause of the illusion is the narration of Umar bin Musa bin Al-Wajih from Simak with it with the wording: \"I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with the funeral of Thabit bin Al-Dahdah on a horse with white legs and forehead under him, without a saddle, with the people around him.

Then he stood and sat on his horse and set off with men walking around him.\" Extracted by Ahmad (5/99).

I would not be exaggerating if I said: What drove the Europeans to it is their fear of death and everything that reminds of it, due to the dominance of materialism over them and their disbelief in the Hereafter!\nFourth: It is a strong cause for reducing those escorting it and those desiring to obtain the reward mentioned previously in Issue (45) of this chapter, because not everyone can hire a car to escort it.\nFifth: This form does not agree, closely or remotely, with what is known about the pure, tolerant Sharia regarding distance from formalities and protocols, especially in such a grave matter: Death!\nTruly I say: If there were nothing in this innovation except this contradiction, that would be enough to reject it. So how about when joined by the violations and evils previously explained and other things I do not mention!\n55 - Standing for it is abrogated, and it is of two types:\nA - The standing of the seated person if it passes by him.\nB - The standing of the one escorting it upon its arrival at the grave until it is placed on the ground.\nThe evidence for that is the Hadith of Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), and it has wordings:\nFirst: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stood for the funeral so we stood, then he sat so we sat.\" Extracted by Muslim (3/59), Ibn Majah (1/468), Al-Tahawi (1/383), Al-Tayalisi (150), and Ahmad No. (631, 1094, 1167).\nSecond: \"He used to stand for funerals, then sat afterwards.\" Narrated by Malik (1/332), and from him Al-Shafi'i in \"Al-Umm\" (1/247) and Abu Dawood (2/64).\nThird: From the path of Waqid bin Amr bin Sa'd bin Mu'adh who said:",

Mas'ud bin Al-Hakam Al-Zurqi told me that he heard Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) in the courtyard of Kufa saying: 'The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to order us to stand for the funeral, then he sat after that, and ordered us to sit'.\" Extracted by Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad (627), Al-Tahawi (1/282), and Ibn Hibban in his \"Sahih\" this aspect with another wording, which is:\nFourth: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stood with funerals until they were placed, and the people stood with him. Then he sat after that, and ordered them to sit.\"\nFifth: From the path of Isma'il bin Mas'ud (1) bin Al-Hakam Al-Zurqi from his father who said: \"I witnessed a funeral in Iraq, and I saw men standing waiting for it to be placed. I saw Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) signaling to them to sit, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) had ordered us to sit after standing\" (2). Extracted by Al-Tahawi (1/282) with a Hasan chain.\n56 - It is recommended for the one who carries it to perform ablution (Wudu), due to his saying (peace be upon him): \"Whoever washes a dead person, let him perform Ghusl, and whoever carries him, let him perform Wudu.\" It is an authentic Hadith, as previously explained in Issue (31).",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) In the original \"Isma'il bin Al-Hakam bin Mas'ud,\" the correct is what I established. It seems it was inverted by the printer or some copyists. \n2. I say: This wording and the one before it are explicit that standing for it until it is placed falls under the prohibition, and that it is abrogated. So the saying of Siddiq Hasan Khan in \"Al-Rawdah\" (1/176) after establishing the abrogation of standing for it if it passes: \"As for the standing of people behind it until it is placed on the ground, it is firm (Muhkam) and not abrogated.\" This is a clear error, contradicting the two wordings we mentioned. Apparently, he did not come across them.",

I mention among them the Hadith of Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: \"That a man from the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) died on the day of Khaybar. They mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). He said: 'Pray over your companion.' The faces of the people changed because of that. He said: 'Indeed, your companion stole (Ghal) from the booty in the cause of Allah.' So we searched his belongings and found beads from the beads of the Jews not worth two dirhams!\" Extracted by Malik in \"Al-Muwatta\" (2/14), Abu Dawood (1/425), Al-Nasa'i (1/278), Ibn Majah (2/197), and Ahmad (4/114 - 5/192) with an authentic chain. Al-Hakim said: \"Authentic according to their condition,\" but there is a reservation about it which I clarified in \"Al-Ta'liqat al-Jiyad 'ala Zad al-Ma'ad.\" In this chapter, there is [a report] from Abu Qatadah, his Hadith will come in the next issue p. 82, and from Abu Hurairah in it, p. 84.\n58 - Two persons are exempted from this, so prayer over them is not obligatory:\nFirst: The child who has not reached puberty, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not pray over his son Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"Ibrahim, the son of the Prophet (peace be upon him), died when he was eighteen months old, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did not pray over him.\"",

(1).\nSecond: The martyr, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not pray over the martyrs of Uhud and others. Three Hadiths regarding that were mentioned previously in Issue (32), (p. 5 2).\nHowever, that does not negate the legitimacy of praying over them without obligation, as will come in the Hadiths regarding them in the following issue:\n59 - It is prescribed to pray over those mentioned below:\nFirst: The child, even if it was a miscarriage (Saqt) (which is what falls from its mother's womb before completion). There are two Hadiths regarding this:\n1 - \"...and the child (and in a narration: the miscarriage) is prayed over, and forgiveness and mercy are supplicated for his parents.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood, Al-Nasa'i, and others with an authentic chain, and it preceded in full in Issue (50).\n2 - From Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: \"A boy from the boys of the Ansar was brought to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and he prayed over him.

Know that it does not detract from the establishment of the Hadith that it was narrated from him (peace be upon him) that he prayed over his son Ibrahim. Because that has not been authentically proven from him, even if it came from paths, they are all defective either by Irsal or severe weakness, as you see detailed in \"Nasb al-Rayah\" (2/279 - 280). Ahmad narrated (3/281) from Anas that he was asked: Did the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) pray over his son Ibrahim? He said: I do not know. Its chain is authentic. Had he prayed over him, it would not have been hidden from Anas, God willing, and he served him for ten years.",

The wording is Al-Nasa'i's. Its chain is authentic, all its narrators are trustworthy narrators of Muslim, except his sheikh Amr bin Mansur, who is Thiqah Thabt (trustworthy, firm).\nIt appears that the miscarriage is only prayed over if the soul has been breathed into it, which is if it completes four months, then dies. But if it falls before that, [it is not prayed over] because it is not a deceased as is obvious. The basis for that is the Hadith of Abdullah bin Masud (may Allah be pleased with him) raised (Marfu'): \"The creation of one of you is gathered in his mother's womb for forty days, then it is a clot (Alaqah) for a like period, then it is a morsel (Mudghah) for a like period, then an angel is sent to him... and breathes the soul into him.\" Agreed upon.\nSome stipulated that the miscarriage must cry out (show signs of life), due to the Hadith: \"If the miscarriage cries out, it is prayed over and inherited.\" But it is a weak Hadith not to be used as proof, as clarified by scholars (2).\nSecond: The Martyr. There are many Hadiths, I suffice with mentioning some of them:\n1 - From Shaddad bin Al-Had:",

(1) Al-Nawawi, may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him, said: \"Scholars of Muslims whose opinion counts have agreed that whoever dies from the children of Muslims is among the people of Paradise.

He said: Certainty regarding a specific individual is not correct because the faith of the parents in reality is unseen, and it is the criteria with Allah the Exalted. \n2.

The Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered regarding her, so her clothes were tied around her, then he ordered regarding her and she was stoned. Then he prayed over her. Umar said to him: Do you pray over her, O Prophet of Allah, when she has committed adultery?

Therefore, Ibn al-Qayyim said in \"Tahdhib al-Sunan\" (4/295): (The correct view in the issue is that he has the choice between praying over them and leaving it, due to the coming of traditions for both matters. This is one of the narrations from Imam Ahmad, and it is the most fitting with his principles and school).

    "text_en": "Sixth: Before burial, one may perform the funeral prayer over the deceased, or some may pray over him while others do not, and they pray at his grave. The imam in the second case should be one who has not prayed over him. There are narrations regarding this: 1. From ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās (may Allah be pleased with them), he said: “A man died—whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to visit—and they buried him at night. When morning came, they informed him. He said: ‘Why did you not inform me?’ They said: ‘It was night and dark; we did not want to dig for his grave.’ So he came to his grave and prayed over him, [he said: ‘We stood and formed behind him’], [‘I was among them’], [and he pronounced four Takbīrs].” Reported by al-Bukhārī, Ibn Mājah, Muslim, al-Nasā’ī, al-Tirmidhī, Abū al-Jārūd, al-Bayhaqī, al-Ṭayālisī, and Aḥmad. 2. From Abū Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him): “A black woman used to clean (or collect scraps and sticks from) the mosque. She died, and the Prophet ﷺ missed her. He asked about her after a few days and was told she had died. He said: ‘Why did you not inform me?’ They said: ‘She died at night and was buried; we did not want to wake you.’ He said: ‘It is as if they belittled her matter. Show me her grave.’ They showed it, and he came to her grave and prayed over her. Then, according to Thābit or another narration, these graves are filled with darkness for their occupants, but Allah illuminates them through my prayers.”",

    "text": "Second: That in a narration by Al-Bukhari with the wording: \"That a woman or a man used to sweep the mosque, and I do not see him to be other than a woman.\" It seemed probable to the narrator that it was a woman. Third: The Hadith was reported via another path from Abu Hurairah, in which the narrator did not doubt; its wording is: \"The Prophet missed a black woman who used to pick up rags and sticks from the mosque, so he said: 'Where is so-and-so?' They said: 'She died'.\" He mentioned the Hadith. Al-Bayhaqi cited it in this manner (2/440 - 4/32) via the path of Al-Ala' bin Abdul-Rahman from his father from him. Ibn Khuzaimah also narrated it in his \"Sahih\" as mentioned in \"Al-Fath\". The first addition is from Al-Bayhaqi and Ibn Khuzaimah, and its first part is from Ahmad. The second is from Muslim and Al-Bayhaqi in a narration, and Al-Bukhari has its meaning. Abu Dawood and \"The Two Musnads\" have the second part of it. The third addition is from Al-Bayhaqi, and the fourth is his in a narration, and for Muslim and likewise Ahmad; and he [Ahmad] has the addition from the statement of Thabit, which is also with Al-Bayhaqi. Al-Hafiz [Ibn Hajar], following Al-Bayhaqi, considered it probable that the fourth addition is interpolated (Mudraj) in the Hadith and that it is from the Mursal narrations of Thabit. Ibn at-Turkumani disagreed with them, holding that it is connected (Musnad) from the narration of Abu Rafi' from Abu Hurairah \"because it is like that in Sahih Muslim,\" but this statement of Thabit supports what the first two went to. It is strengthened by the fact that the Hadith was reported from the narration of Ibn Abbas as well, and this addition is not in it; At-Tabarani narrated it in \"Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir\" (3/128/2). Yes, this addition or its meaning is proven as connected (Musnad) in another Hadith, which is: 3 - On the authority of Yazid bin Thabit - who was older than Zaid - he said: \"We went out with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, [one day], and when he reached Al-Baqi', he saw a new grave. He asked about it, and they said: 'So-and-so (a female client of the tribe of so-and-so).' He recognized her and said: 'Why did you not inform me about her?' They said: '[She died at noon, and] you were napping and fasting, so we disliked properly to disturb you.' He said: 'Do not do that. I must know; no dead person among you dies while I am among you except that you inform me of him, for my prayer over him is a mercy.' Then he came to the grave, and we lined up behind him, and he said four Takbirs over it.\"",

The context belongs to Ibn Majah, and the additions are from Al-Nasa'i. Its chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim for all of them. 4 - On the authority of some Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace: That the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to visit the sick among the poor Muslims and their weak ones, and follow their funerals, and no one else would pray over them. A poor woman from the people of Al-'Awali had been ill for a long time, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to ask her neighbors who attended to her about her, \"and he commanded them not to bury her if anything happened to her (i.e., she died) so that he could pray over her. That woman died at night, and they carried her and brought her with the funerals—or he said: to the place of funerals—at the Mosque of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace (1), so that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, could pray over her as he had commanded them. However, they found that he had gone to sleep after the Isha prayer,\" so they disliked waking (2) the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from his sleep, so they prayed over her. Then they took her away. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, woke up, he asked her neighbors who attended to him about her. They informed him of her news and that they disliked waking the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for her. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to them: \"Why did you do that? Let's go.\" So they went with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, until they stood at her grave. They lined up behind the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, as they line up for funeral prayer, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed over her and said four Takbirs just as he says Takbir over funerals.\" Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi (4/48) with an authentic chain, and Al-Nasa'i (1/280, 281) in summary. Seventh: Whoever dies in a land where there is no one to pray the present prayer over him, a group of Muslims should pray the absent prayer (Salat al-Ghaib) over him, due to the prayer of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, over the Negus (Al-Najashi). This was narrated by a group of his Companions, some adding to others. I have collected their Hadiths regarding this, then I cited them in one context approximately for benefit. The context is for the Hadith of Abu Hurairah: \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, announced to the people [while he was in Medina] the death of the Negus [Ashamah] [the ruler of Abyssinia] on the day in which he died. [He said: A brother has died (and in a narration: Today a righteous servant of Allah has died)]",

Its chain is also authentic. 7 - Then Ahmad (4/264 - 263) narrated it from Jarir bin Abdullah in a Marfu' form with the wording: \"Your brother the Negus has died, so seek forgiveness for him\" (1). Its chain is Hasan. Know that what we have mentioned regarding the prayer for the absent is what the Hadith supports and nothing else. A group of verifiers (Muhaqqiqin) of the schools of thought preceded us in choosing this. Here is a summary of the words of Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, in this regard. He said in \"Zad al-Ma'ad\" (1/205, 206): \"It was not from his guidance, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his Sunnah to pray over every absent dead person, for many people from the Muslims died while they were absent, and he did not pray over them.

This is supported by the fact that the explicit text came from him confirming his belief in the Prophethood of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded us to set out to the land of the Negus\" - and he mentioned the story, and in it - \"And the Negus said: I testify that he is the Messenger of Allah, and that he is the one whom Jesus son of Mary gave glad tidings of. Were it not for the kingship I am in, I would have come to him to carry his sandals.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood and Al-Bayhaqi with an authentic chain as Al-Bayhaqi said, as quoted by Al-Iraqi in \"Takhrij Al-Ihya\" (2/200). It has a supporting evidence from the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud narrated by At-Tayalisi (346), and other supporting evidences in Musnad Ahmad (5/290 and 292).",

    "text": "1 - That this is legislation and a Sunnah for the Ummah to pray over every absent person; this is the saying of Al-Shafi'i and Ahmad. 2 - Abu Hanifa and Malik said: This was specific to him (the Prophet), and it is not for anyone else. 3 - Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: The correct view is that if the absent person dies in a land where he was not prayed over, the absent prayer is prayed over him, just as the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed over the Negus because he died among the disbelievers and had not been prayed over. But if he was prayed over where he died, the absent prayer is not prayed over him, because the obligation was dropped by the Muslims' prayer over him. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed over the absent and left it (in other cases), and his doing it and leaving it are both Sunnah. This has its place, and Allah knows best. There are three opinions in the Madhhab of Ahmad, and the most correct of them is this detailed one. I say: This was chosen by the text of the verifiers from the Shafi'is. Al-Khattabi said in \"Ma'alim as-Sunan\" what implies: I say: The Negus was a Muslim man who believed in the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and verified his prophethood. \"However, he used to conceal his faith. When a Muslim dies, it is obligatory upon the Muslims to pray over him. But since he was among the people of disbelief, and there was no one in his presence to fulfill the right of prayer over him, it became necessary for the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to do that, as he is his Prophet, his Guardian (Wali), and the one with the most right over him. This - and Allah knows best - is the reason that called him to pray over him in the unseen (in absentia). Based on this, if a Muslim dies in any land, and his right to be prayed over has been fulfilled, then one who is in another land absent from him does not pray over him. But if it is known that he was not prayed over due to an obstacle or a valid excuse, the Sunnah is to pray over him and not leave that due to the distance. When they pray over him, they face the Qiblah, and they do not face the land of the deceased if it is in other than the direction of the Qiblah. Some scholars have gone to the dislike of praying for the absent dead, and they claimed that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was specific in this action, as he was in the ruling of one witnessing the Negus, based on what was narrated in some reports \"that the flags of the earth were leveled for him until he could see his place\" (1). This is a corrupt interpretation because...",

    "text": "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, if he did something from the actions of the Shariah, it is upon us to follow him and emulate him, and specificity is not known except with evidence. What clarifies this is that he, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out with the people to the Musalla (place of prayer) and lined them up, and they prayed with him. Thus, it is known that this interpretation is corrupt, and Allah knows best. Al-Ruyani - who is also a Shafi'i - deemed good what Al-Khattabi went to. It is also the Madhhab of Abu Dawood, for he titled the Hadith in his \"Sunan\" with his saying: \"Chapter on Praying over a Muslim who dies in the lands of Shirk (polytheism).\" The verifying scholar Sheikh Salih Al-Maqbili, from the later scholars, also chose this as in \"Nayl al-Awtar\" (4/43). He cited as evidence the addition that occurred in some paths of the Hadith: \"Your brother has died in a land other than yours, so stand and pray over him,\" and its chain is on the condition of the Two Sheikhs. What supports the lack of legitimacy of praying over every absent person is that when the Rightly Guided Caliphs and others died, none of the Muslims prayed the absent prayer over them. Had they done so, the transmission of that would have been mutawatir (widely transmitted) from them. Compare this with what many Muslims are upon today regarding praying over every absent person, especially if he has fame and repute, even if only from a political aspect, and is not known for righteousness or service to Islam. Even if he died in the Makkan Sanctuary and thousands upon thousands prayed the present prayer over him during the Hajj season; compare what we mentioned with such a prayer, and you will know with certainty that it is from the innovations (Bid'ah) about which a scholar of his Sunnah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the way of the Salaf, may Allah be pleased with them, would not doubt. 60 - It is forbidden (Haram) to pray over, seek forgiveness for, and ask for mercy upon disbelievers and hypocrites (1) due to the saying of Allah the Blessed and Exalted: {And do not pray [the funeral prayer, as-Salah] over any of them who has died - ever - or stand at his grave. Indeed, they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient.} [At-Tawbah: 84].

The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the beginning, used to be patient with the harm of the polytheists and would pardon and forgive. Then he was commanded to fight the polytheists, so his pardoning and forgiveness continued for those who displayed Islam even if their inner self was contrary to that, for the interest of reconciliation and not driving people away from him. That is why he said: 'Let not the people talk that Muhammad kills his companions.' When the Conquest happened, and the polytheists entered Islam, and the people of disbelief became few and humiliated, he was commanded to confront the hypocrites and hold them to the bitter truth, especially since that was before the revelation of the explicit prohibition of praying over the hypocrites and other things he was commanded regarding confronting them. With this explanation, the confusion regarding what happened in this story is removed, by the praise of Allah Almighty.\" \n3.

[He said: Were it not that Quraish would shame me - saying: nothing carried him to do that except anxiety/fear - I would have delighted your eye with it!] (The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: By Allah, I will surely ask forgiveness for you as long as I am not forbidden from you. (The Muslims started asking forgiveness for their dead who died as polytheists, so Allah Almighty revealed: {It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire} [At-Tawbah: 113], and Allah revealed regarding Abu Talib, saying to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace: {Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided} [Al-Qasas: 56]!!

It is also with Ibn Jarir from the Hadith of Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib via Mursal chain, but it has the ruling of connected (Mawsul) because he is the one who narrated the Hadith from Al-Musayyib bin Hazn, who is his father. It was also reported from the Hadith of Jabir. Al-Hakim also extracted it and authenticated it, and Al-Dhahabi agreed. It contains the fourth addition, which is with Ibn Jarir via Mursal chain from Mujahid and from Amr bin Dinar. And from Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: \"I heard a man asking forgiveness for his parents while they were polytheists. I said: 'Do you ask forgiveness for your parents while they are polytheists!?' He said: [Did not Abraham ask forgiveness while he (his father) was a polytheist?] He said: So I mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!? So it was revealed: {It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire (113) And the request of forgiveness of Abraham (1) for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became apparent to him that he was an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed, Abraham was compassionate and patient.} [At-Tawbah: 113, 114]. Extracted by Al-Nasa'i (11/28), At-Tirmidhi (4/120) - and he graded it Hasan - Ibn Jarir (11/28), Al-Hakim (2/335), and Ahmad (771, 1085). The context is his, and its chain is Hasan.

(1) I say: This seeking of forgiveness is only what Allah Almighty recounted about him at the end of Surah Ibrahim: (Our Lord, forgive me and my parents and the believers the Day the account is established). The exegetes mentioned that this supplication from him was after the death of his father and after his migration to Makkah, as witnessed by the context of the verses in which the mentioned verse appeared at the end. Based on that, the clarification mentioned in the verse of seeking forgiveness must have been after his father's death as well, and that was by Allah informing him. Ibn Abi Hatim extracted with an authentic chain, as Al-Suyuti said in \"Al-Fatawa\" (2/419), from Ibn Abbas who said: \"Abraham kept asking forgiveness for his father until he died. When he died, it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, so he did not ask forgiveness for him.\" \n2. In this Hadith, the reason for the revelation of the verse is different from the reason mentioned in the Hadith before it. There is no contradiction between them due to the possibility of multiple reasons for revelation as happened in other verses. Al-Hafiz supported this in \"Al-Fath\" (8/412).",

Second: His saying, may Allah bless him and grant him peace: \"Pray as you have seen me praying.\" Extracted by Al-Bukhari. The Companions praying over the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, individually without anyone leading them does not contradict what we mentioned, because it was a special case whose reason is unknown. Thus, it is not permissible to leave what he, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, persisted in throughout his blessed life because of it, especially since the mentioned case was not reported with an authentic chain that establishes proof, even if it was narrated via paths that strengthen each other (2).

That was in a speech delivered by the mentioned President on the occasion of the death of the aforementioned, broadcasted on the radio! There is no wonder at this coming from such a ruler, but the wonder is from some Islamic preachers that in the likes of this... where he said in a treatise of his: \"May Allah have mercy on Bernard Shaw...\" Some trustworthy people informed me about a Sheikh who used to pray over those who died from the Ismailis while believing they are not Muslims because they do not view prayer or Hajj [as obligatory] and they deify humans! Yet, he prays over them out of hypocrisy and flattery to them. To Allah is the complaint, and He is the One whose help is sought. \n2.

Al-Shafi'i asserted this.

I have extracted it in \"Sahih Abi Dawood\" (No. 594, 598).

    "foot_note": "1. = Ibn Hazm cited this story in \"Al-Muhalla\" (5/441) with a form of certainty weakening it, even though he did not adopt the ruling it implies. He said: \"We said: We have not left a consensus for you so that you can oppose us with this, but if the Ummah disputes, it is obligatory to refer to the Qur'an and Sunnah, and in the Qur'an and Sunnah is what we have presented.\" I say: It seems Ibn Hazm, may Allah have mercy on him, does not view the statement of a Companion \"The Sunnah is such-and-such\" as having the ruling of Marfu' (elevated to the Prophet), and this contradicts what is established in the two fundamentals (Usul) that such is in the ruling of Marfu', and it is the correct view, Allah willing. More clarification on this will come in Issue (73). As for what Ibn Hazm indicated regarding the \"Qur'an and Sunnah\", he means the Almighty's saying (And those of [blood] relationship are more entitled [to inheritance] in the decree of Allah), and his saying, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the following Hadith in the next issue \"And a man should not lead a man in his family\" as in a narration that Ibn Hazm used as evidence that the ones most entitled to pray over the deceased are the guardians/relatives. It is not hidden that this is reasoning using the general text, while our evidence, which is the Hadith of Al-Hussein, may Allah be pleased with him, is specific, and it is given precedence as established in Usul. That is why the majority of scholars went to what we mentioned, such as Abu Hanifa, Malik, Ahmad, Ishaq, Ibn al-Mundhir, and Al-Shafi'i in his old opinion as in \"Al-Majmu'\" (5/217). Then I realized and said: The Hadith has no generality regarding what we are discussing, because its meaning is: No one should pray as Imam leading the owner of the house in his house. This is clear from the collection of narrations of the Hadith. In a narration by Muslim: \"And a man should not lead a man in his family,\" and in another by him \"And do not lead a man in his family nor in his authority.\" This is an argument against Ibn Hazm because the apparent meaning is also that what is intended is the Sultan (Authority) who has the guardianship of people's affairs. The apparent meaning is also that he is given precedence over others even if they recite more Qur'an than him. See Al-Shawkani (3/134).",

He said: And in the group were Al-Hasan, Al-Hussein, Abu Hurairah, and about eighty of the Companions of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Al-Sha'bi narrated it mentioning the manner of placement similarly, and mentioned that the Imam was Ibn Umar, but did not mention the questioning. He said: And behind him were Ibn Al-Hanafiyyah, Al-Hussein, and Ibn Abbas, and in a narration: Abdullah bin Ja'far). 69 - It is permissible to pray a prayer over each of the funerals, because it is the origin, and because the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did that regarding the martyrs of Uhud. There are two Hadiths regarding that: First: From Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, and it was presented in Issue (59), Hadith (2) page 82. Second: From Ibn Abbas who said: \"When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood over Hamzah, he ordered regarding him, so he was prepared towards the Qiblah. Then he said nine Takbirs over him. Then the martyrs were gathered to him. Every time a martyr was brought, he was placed next to Hamzah, so he prayed over him and over the martyrs with him until he prayed over him and the martyrs seventy-two prayers.\"",

    "text": "Extracted by At-Tabarani in his \"Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir\" (3/107, 108) via the path of Muhammad bin Ishaq, narrated to me by Muhammad bin Ka'b Al-Qurazi and Al-Hakam bin Utaybah from Miqsam and Mujahid from him. I say: This is a good chain (Jayyid); its men are all trustworthy. Muhammad bin Ishaq explicitly stated narration (Tahdith), so the doubt of his Tadlis (obfuscation) is removed. It seems that Imam Al-Suhayli and Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar did not come across this chain, for Al-Hafiz said in \"At-Talkhis\" (5/153, 154): \"And in the chapter is also the Hadith of Ibn Abbas, narrated by Ibn Ishaq who said: Narrated to me by one whom I do not accuse from Miqsam, the client of Ibn Abbas, from Ibn Abbas... (I say: He mentioned the Hadith similarly except that he said: 'seven' instead of 'nine', then he said:) Al-Suhayli said: If the one Ibn Ishaq left unnamed is Al-Hasan bin 'Umarah, then he is weak; otherwise, he is unknown and there is no proof in it. End quote. I say: What led Al-Suhayli to that is what occurred in the introduction of 'Muslim' from Shu'bah that Al-Hasan bin 'Umarah narrated to him from Al-Hakam from Miqsam from Ibn Abbas 'that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed over the slain of Uhud.' So I asked Al-Hakam? He said: He did not pray over them.' End quote. However, the Hadith of Ibn Abbas was narrated from other paths...\" I say: Then he mentioned some of them, and the path of At-Tabarani is not among them. It indicates that the unnamed person in that narration is not unknown or weak, but rather a known trustworthy narrator, who is Muhammad bin Ka'b Al-Qurazi or Al-Hakam bin Utaybah, or both of them together. Al-Hakam's statement in the narration of Muslim \"He did not pray over them\" does not deceive regarding this, due to the possibility that Al-Hakam forgot what he had narrated, as happened similarly to others in other Hadiths. Even if we accept for the sake of argument that Al-Hakam's denial of his Hadith impugns its authenticity from him, we do not accept that it impugns the authenticity of the Hadith itself as long as another trustworthy narrator, Al-Qurazi, narrated it. This is clear, if Allah Almighty wills. (1)",

The first view is the Madhhab, because it involves more action and is more hopeful for acceptance, and it is not a significant delay. And Allah knows best.",

They did so, and he was stopped near their chambers so they could pray over him. He was taken out through the Gate of Funerals which was towards the seats (Al-Maqa'id). News reached them that the people criticized that and said: This is an innovation; funerals were not taken into the Mosque! This reached Aisha, so she said: How hasty are people to criticize what they have no knowledge of! They criticized us for passing a funeral through the Mosque, [By Allah] the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not pray over Suhail bin Bayda [and his brother] except in the middle of the Mosque.\" Extracted by Muslim (3/63) via two paths from her, and the authors of the Sunan and others. I have extracted it in \"Ahkam Al-Masajid\" from my book \"Ath-Thamar Al-Mustatab\". The additions are for Muslim except the first one which is for Al-Bayhaqi (4/51). 72 - But it is better to pray over it outside the Mosque in a place designated for prayer over funerals, as was the case during the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and it is the predominant practice of his guidance regarding it. There are Hadiths regarding that: First: From Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him: \"That the Jews came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a man from them and a woman who had committed adultery.

Al-Haythami said in \"Al-Majma'\" (3/36): \"And its chain is Hasan.\" I say: It has another path from Anas with Al-Diya' by which the Hadith is strengthened. Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated in \"Al-Musannaf\" (81 65/1 - Al-Kawakib) and Abu Bakr bin Al-Athram as in \"Fath Al-Bari\" by Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbali (65/81/1 - Al-Kawakib) from Anas: \"He used to dislike that a mosque be built between graves\"... Its men are the trustworthy men of the Two Sheikhs. The Hadith is witnessed by what is mutawatir from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, regarding the prohibition of taking graves as mosques. I have mentioned what was reported regarding that in the beginning of my book \"Tahdhir as-Sajid min Ittikhadh al-Qubur Masajid\" (Warning the Prostrator against taking Graves as Mosques), and I will mention some of it in Issue (128 paragraph 9). 73 - The Imam stands behind the head of the man, and the middle of the woman.

Al-Bajuri did the opposite in his footnote on Ibn Al-Qasim, saying (1 - 424): \"It is Sunnah that the prayer over it be in a mosque\"! Then he did not mention praying over it in the Musalla!! The truth is what we mentioned regarding the recommendation (Sunnah) along with the saying of permissibility of praying over it in the Mosque due to the Hadith of Aisha, but interpreting it as being for an incidental reason is far-fetched, because if it were so, it would not have been hidden from Sayyidah Aisha and those with her from the Mothers of the Believers, and they would not have requested bringing the funeral into the Mosque without an excuse. This is clear if Allah Almighty wills.",

So he prayed over her and stood in her middle (and in a narration: at her buttocks, and upon her was a green bier). Among us was Al-Ala' bin Ziyad Al-Adawi (1). When he saw the difference in his standing over the man and the woman, he said: O Abu Hamzah, is this how the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to stand where you stood, and from the woman where you stood? He said: Yes. He said: So Al-Ala' turned to us and said: Preserve (memorize) this).\" Extracted by Abu Dawood (2/66, 67), At-Tirmidhi (2/146) - and he graded it Hasan - Ibn Majah, At-Tahawi (1/283), Al-Bayhaqi (4/32), At-Tayalisi (No. 2149), and Ahmad (3/118, 204). The context is his. All of them extracted it via the path of Hammam bin Yahya from Abu Ghalib, except Abu Dawood, who extracted it via the path of Abdul-Warith - who is Ibn Sa'id - from him. At-Tahawi also extracted it in a narration of his in summary. Its chain from both paths is authentic; their men are the men of the Two Sahihs except Abu Ghalib, who is trustworthy as in \"At-Taqrib\" by Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar. It is amazing how he mentioned in the explanation of the following Hadith of Samurah in \"Al-Fath\" (3/157) that Al-Bukhari indicated the weakening of this Hadith, then he remained silent on that and did not critique it with anything!

The Hadith is clear in indication that the Sunnah is for the Imam to stand opposite the middle of the woman, and it is the meaning of Anas's Hadith: \"at her buttocks\".

This is apparent, praise be to Allah. Therefore, the majority of scholars did not turn to this interpretation, so they went to what the Hadith indicated of standing at the head of the man and the middle of the woman. Among them are Imam Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq as in \"Al-Majmu'\" (5/225). Al-Shawkani said (4 - 57): \"And it is the truth.\" I say: Some Hanafis chose it, rather it is a saying of Abu Hanifa himself as in \"Al-Hidayah\" (1/462) and Abu Yusuf also as in \"Sharh Al-Ma'ani\" (1/284) by Imam At-Tahawi, and he preferred it over their other saying which is \"he stands for the man and woman opposite the chest\"! It is also the saying of Imam Muhammad, and the Hanafis are upon it. It was argued for them in \"Al-Hidayah\" by saying \"because it is the place of the heart, and in it is the light of faith, so standing at it is an indication of intercession for his faith.\" Then he mentioned Abu Hanifa's first saying and that he argued with the saying of Anas \"it is the Sunnah\", so the author of \"Al-Hidayah\" answered him by saying: \"We say its interpretation is: her funeral was not in a bier so he stood between her and them.\" I say: You have known from the previous the invalidity of this interpretation. Even if we concede to them, \"what is their proof for opposing the Hadith in its first part which is standing opposite the head of the man? They said: Rather he stands opposite his chest. I wish I knew what drives them to openly oppose the Sunnah with such invalid justifications and their saying: \"because it is the place of the heart...\" You see them saying it in an opinion of theirs; why didn't they take it as Imam At-Tahawi, may Allah have mercy on him, did, so they would be correct in Sunnah and take the saying of the Imams at the same time? With this explicit opposition to this Sunnah and others, regarding which there is no ambiguity, they attribute those who accuse them of prioritizing opinion over Sunnah to fanaticism against them!",

Second: What came in some Hadiths \"The last of what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said Takbir over the funeral was four.\" The answer: It is a weak Hadith; it has paths, some weaker than others, so it is not suitable to hold onto it to reject what is established from him, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, by authentic, widespread chains. Al-Hafiz said in \"At-Talkhis\" (5/167) and before him Al-Hazimi in \"Al-I'tibar\" (p. 95) and Al-Bayhaqi in \"As-Sunan\" (74/3): \"It was narrated from more than one aspect, all of them weak.\" As for what appeared in \"Al-Majmu'\" (3/35): \"And from Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed over the slain of Uhud and said nine Takbirs nine times, then seven seven, then four four until he joined Allah. Narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Kabir and Al-Awsat and its chain is Hasan.\" It is rejected from two aspects: First: It contradicts the saying of Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar and the Imams before him who explicitly stated that all paths of the Hadith are weak. Second: The Hadith was extracted by At-Tabari in \"Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir\" (3/120/2) and its chain is thus: Narrated to us Ahmad bin Al-Qasim At-Ta'i, Bishr bin Al-Walid Al-Kindi, Narrated to us Abu Yusuf the Judge, Narrated to me Nafi' bin Umar, he said I heard Ata' bin Abi Rabah narrating from Ibn Abbas with it. I say: A chain like this is not good, for it contains three defects: First: Abu Yusuf the Judge, who is Yaqub bin Ibrahim; Ibn Al-Mubarak and others weakened him, and Al-Fallas described him as having many mistakes. Second: The weakness of Bishr bin Al-Walid Al-Kindi, for he had become senile. Third: The contradiction in its chain, for At-Tabarani (3/119/1) and Al-Hazimi in \"Al-I'tibar\" (95) extracted it from a group who said from Nafi' Abu Hormuz from Ata' from Ibn Abbas with it until he said: \"People of Badr\" instead of \"Slain of Uhud\". This is how Al-Haythami cited it and said: \"It contains Nafi' Abu Hormuz and he is weak.\" I say: Rather he is very weak; Ibn Ma'in called him a liar, and Abu Hatim said: \"Abandoned (Matruk), his Hadith is gone.\" I say, so he is the bane of the Hadith, and he is the one who narrated it from Ata'. What occurred in the first path that it is Nafi' bin Umar - who is trustworthy - is an illusion from some of its narrators, and the likely one is Al-Kindi who had become senile as you knew.",

So it is not permissible to do that, because it is an action in prayer for which no text has come. It only came from him, peace be upon him, that he said Takbir and raised his hands in every lowering and raising, and there is no lowering and raising in it.

It should not be said: It does not explicitly attribute that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, because we say: The saying of a Companion \"From the Sunnah is such-and-such\" is connected (Musnad) elevated (Marfu') to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, according to the correct opinions even according to the Hanafis. Rather, An-Nawawi said in \"Al-Majmu'\" (5/232): \"It is the correct Madhhab stated by the majority of scholars from our companions in Usul and others from the Usulis and Muhaddithin.\" I say: The verifier Ibn Al-Humam asserted this in \"At-Tahrir\", and his commentator Ibn Amir Hajj said (2/224): \"This is the saying of our early companions, and the author of Al-Mizan, the Shafi'is, and the majority of Muhaddithin took it.\" I say: Based on this, it is among the wonders that the Hanafis do not take this Hadith despite its authenticity and its coming from more than one aspect, and despite its suitability to prove the Sunnah according to their method and principles! Imam Muhammad said in \"Al-Muwatta\" (p. 175): \"There is no recitation over the funeral, and it is the saying of Abu Hanifa.\" Similar is in \"Al-Mabsut\" by As-Sarakhsi (2/64). When some of the later ones among them saw the distance of this saying from correctness, and its shunning of the Hadith, they said it is permissible to recite Al-Fatihah on the condition that he intends by it Supplication and Praise of Allah! They conditioned that only to reconcile - in their claim - between the Hadith and the saying of their Imam, as if his saying is another authentic Hadith that should be paired with the authentic Hadith and then reconciled! Even though this condition is invalid in itself due to lack of narration, the establishment of reciting a Surah with Al-Fatihah in the Hadith invalidates it, and it is absolute so that condition cannot be stipulated in it either! They have another wonder! Which is their saying \"that reciting Subhanaka - after the first Takbir is from the Sunan of prayer over the funeral\"! Even though there is no basis for that in the Sunnah as previously noted in the footnote (p. 119). So they combined affirming what has no basis in the Sunnah and denying the legitimacy of what was reported in it!! If you say: The verifier Ibn Al-Humam said in \"Fath al-Qadir\" (1/459): \"They said: He does not recite Al-Fatihah, unless he recites it with the intention of Praise, and recitation has not been established from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.\" I say: This statement from such a verifier is more amazing than all that preceded, for the establishment of recitation from him, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is something not hidden from the likes of him with its occurrence in \"Sahih Al-Bukhari\" and others as previously clarified. Therefore, it is overwhelmingly likely that he indicates by that that the Hadith does not stand as evidence to prove recitation because of his saying in it \"Sunnah\" based on the difference we previously mentioned. If the matter is as such, then this is another wonder, for his Madhhab is that the Companion's saying \"Sunnah\" has the ruling of Musnad Marfu' to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, as previously quoted from his book \"At-Tahrir\". They have proceeded upon that in their branches (Furu'), so take for example the following issue. He said in \"Al-Hidayah\": \"If they carry the deceased on the bier, they take its four corners; the Sunnah was reported regarding that. Al-Shafi'i said: The Sunnah is that...

An-Nawawi used this addition as evidence for the recommendation of a short Surah. There is nothing in the Hadith indicating that it should be short, so perhaps the evidence for that is what passed regarding the request to hasten the funeral to its grave, and Allah knows best. 78 - And he reads silently, due to the Hadith of Abu Umamah bin Sahl who said: \"The Sunnah in the prayer over the funeral is to recite in the first Takbir the Mother of the Qur'an (Al-Fatihah) silently, then say three Takbirs, and the Taslim is at the last one.\" Extracted by Al-Nasa'i and others with an authentic chain as passed in Issue (74) Hadith Five from Paragraph (A), (111). 79 - Then he says the Takbir (Second Takbir), and prays for (sends blessings upon) the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, due to the mentioned Hadith of Abu Umamah that a man from the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, informed him: \"That the Sunnah in the prayer over the funeral is that the Imam says Takbir, then recites Fatihat al-Kitab after the first Takbir silently to himself, then prays for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and sincerely makes supplication for the funeral in the (three) Takbirs, not reciting in any of them, then he says Taslim silently to himself (when he leaves (to his right), and the Sunnah is that those behind him do like what their Imam did).\"",

Ibn Humam said: \"So it becomes obligatory to rule that this is the Sunnah, and if its contrary is realized from some of the Salaf, it is for an incidental reason.\" Look how he made Ibn Mas'ud's saying \"from the Sunnah\" into the ruling of Marfu', and did not make Ibn Abbas's saying likewise! Is the source of this contradiction oversight or fanaticism for the Madhhab, may Allah save us from it?! This is assuming the authenticity of that from Ibn Mas'ud, so how about when it is not authentic, because it is broken (Munqati'); Abu Ubaidah did not reach his father as in \"Al-Jawhar Al-Naqi\" by At-Turkumani Al-Hanafi.

As for the formula of prayer upon the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the funeral, I have not come across it in any of the authentic Hadiths (1). So it appears that the funeral does not have a special formula, but rather one uses a formula from the established formulas in the Tashahhud in the prescribed prayer (2).",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) A formula close to the Abrahamic prayer was narrated from Ibn Mas'ud, but its chain is very weak, so one does not occupy oneself with it. Al-Sakhawi cited it in \"Al-Qawl Al-Badi'\" p. (153 - 154) and Ibn al-Qayyim in \"Jala' al-Afham\", and he said (255): \"So it is recommended to pray upon him, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the funeral as one prays upon him in the Tashahhud because the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, taught that to his Companions when they asked him about the manner of praying upon him.\" \n2. These are seven formulas I presented in \"Sifat Salat al-Nabi (Description of the Prophet's Prayer), may Allah bless him and grant him peace.\" The Islamic Office has printed it, the third edition, and it contains important additions.

That is why supplication was legislated in the prayer over him that is not legislated like it in the supplication for the living. Ibn al-Qayyim said: This invalidates the saying of those who claim that the dead does not benefit from supplication.\" I say: In the narration of Al-Hakim from the Hadith of Abu Umamah mentioned previously \"and he sincerely prays in the three Takbirs\", the word prayer (Salat) here means supplication (Dua) evidenced by the first narration \"and make supplication sincere\" because the original meaning of Salat in language is Dua. So from the strange interpretations is what is in \"Al-Qawl Al-Badi'\" (p. 152) \"and he makes prayer sincere, meaning he raises his voice in his prayer with the three Takbirs\"!",

This clarifies that what is intended by his saying in the first Hadith: \"like the Taslim in prayer\" means the two known Taslims.",
    "foot_note": "1. = I say: The Hadith of Abu Hurairah with Al-Bayhaqi has a Hasan chain, and there is no harm in acting upon it in such a place, even if it is suspended, provided it is not taken as a Sunnah in a way that leads to thinking it is from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. What I choose is to supplicate in the prayer over the child with Type (Second) because of his saying in it: \"and our young... O Allah, do not deprive us of his reward, and do not send us astray after him.\" Imam Ahmad went to the recommendation of supplication in this place, as narrated by Abu Dawood in \"Al-Masail\" (153) from him, and it is the Madhhab of the Shafi'is. An-Nawawi argued for them in \"Al-Majmu'\" (5/239) with the Hadith of Al-Hajari mentioned above, and arguing with what is before it is stronger. It is a proof against the Hanafis where they said: \"Then he says the fourth Takbir and says Taslim without any remembrance between them.\" Third: The Shafi'is also went to the obligation of absolute supplication for the deceased due to the Hadith of Abu Hurairah previously mentioned: \"...then make supplication sincere for him.\" This is true, but they restricted it to the third Takbir, and An-Nawawi admitted that it is a mere claim, so he said (5/236): \"The place of this supplication is the third Takbir, and it is obligatory in it, and does not suffice in other than it without disagreement (among them), but there is no clear evidence for restricting it to it. They agreed that no specific supplication is appointed for it.\" I say: However, preferring what preceded of his supplications, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, over what some people deemed good is something a Muslim should not hesitate about, for the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. That is why Al-Shawkani said (4/55): \"Know that mentions of supplications not narrated from him, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, have occurred in books of Fiqh, but holding onto what is established from him is better.\" I say: Rather I believe it is obligatory upon one who has knowledge of what was reported from him, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Turning away from it then leads to fear that the saying of Allah Almighty applies to him: (Do you exchange that which is better for that which is lower)?",

Meaning that he, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sometimes said Taslim twice and sometimes one Taslim, but the first is more frequent. However, this probability is far-fetched because the single Taslim, although established from him, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was not narrated by Ibn Mas'ud, so it does not appear that it enters into his mentioned saying \"like the Taslim in prayer\". And Allah knows best. The Hadith has a witness narrated by Sharik from Ibrahim Al-Hajari who said: \"Abdullah bin Abi Awfa led us in prayer over the funeral of his daughter. He remained for a while until we thought he would say Takbir five times, then he said Taslim to his right and his left. When he finished, we said to him: What is this? He said: I do not increase for you over what I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, doing, or: this is how the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did.

Al-Bayhaqi provided chains for most of these reports, and added to them \"Wathilah bin Al-Asqa', Abu Umamah, and others\".

He said: Like this, and he turned his neck to his right (and said: As-Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah).\" I say: The addition of \"Wa Barakatuh\" in this Taslim is prescribed, contrary to some of them, due to its establishment in some paths of the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud previously mentioned regarding the two Taslims in the obligatory prayer, and likewise in this issue of funeral prayer as preceded.

Her funeral was brought after the Morning Prayer (Subh), and placed in Al-Baqi'. He said: Tariq used to pray Subh very early (in darkness). Ibn Abi Harmalah said: I heard Abdullah bin Umar say to the family: Either you pray over your funeral now, or you leave it until the sun rises high. Its chain is authentic on the condition of the Two Sheikhs. Then Malik narrated from Ibn Umar who said: Funeral prayer is prayed after Asr and after Subh if they were prayed at their times. Its chain is authentic too. Al-Bayhaqi narrated with a good chain from Ibn Juraij, Ziyad informed me that Ali informed him that a funeral was placed in the graveyard of the people of Basra when the sun turned yellow, so he did not pray over it until the sun set. So Abu Barzah commanded the caller to call for prayer then established it. Abu Barzah stepped forward and prayed Maghrib with them - and among the people was Anas bin Malik, and Abu Barzah is from the Ansar from the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace - then they prayed over the funeral. Al-Khattabi said in \"Al-Ma'alim\" (4/327) summarized: People differed on the permissibility of praying over the funeral and burying in these three hours. Most people of knowledge went to the dislike of praying over it in these times. It is the saying of Ata', An-Nakha'i, Al-Awza'i, At-Thawri, the People of Opinion (Ahlu-Ra'y), Ahmad, and Ishaq. Al-Shafi'i sees prayer and burial at any hour of night or day.

There are two Hadiths regarding this: First: From a group of Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, among them Abu Talha Al-Ansari - and the context is his: \"That the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered regarding twenty-four men from the leaders of Quraish on the Day of Badr, (so they were dragged by their legs) and thrown into a well (Tawa) (1) from the wells of Badr, filthy and malignant (some over others), (except for what happened with Umayyah bin Khalaf, for he swelled in his armor and filled it, so when they went to move him he disintegrated (2), so they left him and threw over him what covered him of earth and stones). He, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to, if he prevailed over a people, stay in the open area (Al-Arsah) (3) for three nights. When it was the third day at Badr, he ordered his mount, so its saddle was fastened. Then he walked and his Companions followed him, and they said: We do not see him setting out except for some need of his, until he stood at the edge of the well (Ar-Rakiyy) (4). He began calling them by their names and the names of their fathers (and they had become carcasses): (O Abu Jahl bin Hisham, O Utbah bin Rabi'ah, O Shaibah bin Rabi'ah, O Walid bin Utbah), would it have pleased you that you obeyed Allah and His Messenger? For indeed we found what our Lord promised us to be true, so have you found what your Lord promised to be true? He said: (Umar heard the saying of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so he said: O Messenger of Allah! You speak to bodies that have no spirits (souls), (and do they hear? Allah Almighty says: {Indeed, you will not make the dead hear} [An-Naml: 80]), so the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: By the One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, you are not more hearing of what I say than them, (By Allah) (indeed they know now that",

Qatadah said: Allah brought them to life (for him) until he made them hear his speech, as rebuke, belittlement, vengeance, grief and regret.\" I say: A group of Companions narrated it. This is the narration of some of them, and they are: First: Abu Talha Al-Ansari. Qatadah narrates it saying: Anas bin Malik mentioned to us from Abu Talha with it. Extracted by Al-Bukhari (7/240 - 241) - and the wording is his - Muslim (8/164), and Ahmad (4/129). The fifth addition is his, and it is on the condition of Muslim. Al-Nasa'i also extracted it (1/293), but he did not mention Abu Talha in his chain. It is a narration for Muslim (8/163) and Ahmad (3/104, 145, 182: 219 - 287), and he has the first and seventh additions, and their chain is authentic on the condition of Muslim. They - meaning the three - have the fourth and fifth additions, except that they said: \"Umayyah bin Khalaf\" instead of \"Walid bin Utbah\", which is a mistake from some narrators, because Umayyah was not in the well as indicated by the second addition, which is in the Hadith of Aisha as will come with a Hasan chain. They also have the sixth and tenth additions, and Ahmad has the eleventh. Second: Umar bin Al-Khattab. Anas also narrated it from him similarly, and it contains the second addition. Extracted by Muslim, Al-Nasa'i, and Ahmad (No. 182). Third: Abdullah bin Umar. He has the second narration, and it contains the ninth addition. Extracted by Al-Bukhari (7/242 - 242 - 243) and Ahmad (No. 4864, 4958, 6145). In a narration of his: \"So that was mentioned to Aisha, so she said: And did he - meaning Ibn Umar - [say that]? Rather the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: Indeed they know now...\" Its chain is Hasan, and it contains the second addition also as previously mentioned. Know that the scholars confirmed the narration of Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: \"Indeed they hear now,\" and rejected her saying in it \"And did he\", because he is affirming and she is denying, and because he was not alone in that, rather his father Umar and Abu Talha followed him (corroborated) as preceded, and others as in \"Al-Fath\", so refer to it if you wish.",

It was then narrated by Ahmad (6/276) and Ibn Hisham in 'Al-Sirah' (2/74) with a good chain, containing the third addition.\n\nSecond: From Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"When Abu Talib died, I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said: 'Your uncle, the old (misguided) man, has died, (who will bury him?).' He said: 'Go and bury him, then do not speak of anything until you come to me.' (He said: 'He died a polytheist' (1), so he said: 'Go and bury him'). He said: So I buried him, then I came to him. He said: 'Go and wash (ghusl), then do not speak of anything until you come to me.' He said: So I performed ghusl, then came to him. He said: He then supplicated for me with supplications that I would not be pleased to exchange for red and black camels. He said: And Ali used to perform ghusl if he washed a dead body.\" Narrated by Ahmad (No. 807) and his son in the additions to 'Al-Musnad' (No. 1074) via the path of Abu Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami from him. I say: Its chain is authentic. It was also narrated by Abu Dawud (2/70), Al-Nasa'i (1/282-283), Al-Bayhaqi (3/398), and Ahmad also (No. 759) via the path of Abu Ishaq: 'I heard Najiyah bin Ka'b narrating from Ali...' similar to it. The additions belong to Ahmad except for the second one, which is Al-Nasa'i's. Its chain is also authentic; all its narrators are trustworthy narrators of the two Sahihs except Najiyah bin Ka'b.

As for Al-Nawawi's statement in 'Al-Majmu' (5/181): 'Narrated by Abu Dawud and others, and its chain is weak,' it is rejected. We do not know his reason unless he means that it is from the narration of Abu Ishaq, who is Al-Sabi'i, for he changed (became confused) when he grew old. If this is the case, the answer is from two aspects: First: It is from the narration of Sufyan Al-Thawri from him, and he is among the most reliable people regarding him [Abu Ishaq], as in 'Al-Tahdhib'. Second: He was not alone in narrating it; rather, it came from the first path as previously mentioned. It seems Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) did not come across it or did not recall it when he discussed the hadith. Perhaps he relied on Al-Bayhaqi for its weakening, for Al-Hafiz said in 'Al-Talkhis' (5/149-150) after attributing it to Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al-Nasa'i, Ibn Abi Shaybah, Abu Ya'la, Al-Bazzar, and Al-Bayhaqi via the path of Abu Ishaq...: 'The basis of Al-Bayhaqi's speech implies that it is weak, but the reason for its weakness is not clear. Al-Rafi'i said it is an established, famous hadith; he said that in his Amali.' He also attributed it in 'Al-Fath' (7/154) to Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn al-Jarud as well. (1)",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) Benefit: Al-Bayhaqi included this hadith in the chapter 'A Muslim washes his relative among the polytheists, follows his funeral, buries him, but does not pray over him.' You can see that there is nothing in the hadith regarding what he titled the chapter for concerning washing [the body], so Al-Hafiz commented on his words saying: 'Note: There is no explicit mention in any of the paths of this hadith that he washed him, unless that is taken from his saying: \"He commanded me, so I washed myself (performed ghusl),\" for ghusl is prescribed due to washing the dead, and is not prescribed due to burying him.' Al-Bayhaqi and others did not use it as evidence except for ghusl due to washing the dead. This also occurred in Ahmad and his son's narrations as mentioned. It is strange how this was hidden from Al-Hafiz, especially since he attributed the hadith to Ahmad as you saw. Furthermore, his saying: 'Ghusl is not prescribed due to burying him' is questionable, because one could say: The hadith explicitly indicates the legitimacy of that, and the addition that occurred at the end of the hadith does not contradict it, because it is a new sentence with no relation to what preceded it. I mean, there is no evidence in the hadith that Ali only performed ghusl because of washing the dead [body], simply because the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) commanded him to perform ghusl in the hadith.

Rather, the Muslim is buried in the Muslims' graveyards, and the disbeliever in the polytheists' graveyards. This was the command during the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and it has continued to our time. Among the evidences for this is the hadith of Bashir bin Al-Khasasiyyah who said: \"While I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) (he was holding my hand), he said: 'O Ibn Al-Khasasiyyah, what (have you become) resentful of regarding Allah? (1) You have become one walking with the Messenger of Allah (he said: I think he said: holding his hand).' So I said: '(O Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you), I (have become) not resentful of Allah regarding anything; Allah has done every good for me.' Then he came upon the graves of the polytheists and said: 'These have preceded a great good (or in a narration: missed a great good)' three times. Then he came upon the graves of the Muslims and said: 'These have attained a great good,' three times. While he was walking, a glance from him occurred, and behold, there was a man walking between the graves wearing sandals. He said: 'O you with the Sibtiyyah sandals! Woe to you, throw off your Sibtiyyah sandals!' The man looked, and when he recognized the Messenger of Allah",
    "foot_note": "1. = and that is another thing. Yes, if the following narration is proven, there is no escape from accepting what was previously quoted from Al-Hafiz, for he said following his mentioned speech: 'I say: It occurs in Ibn Abi Shaybah in his Musannaf with the wording: \"I said: Indeed your uncle, the elderly disbeliever has died, so what is your view regarding him? He said: I see that you should wash him and bury him.\"' And it was narrated from another path that he washed him, narrated by Ibn Sa'd from Al-Waqidi.' I say: As for Al-Waqidi, he is abandoned (Matruk) and accused of lying, so his addition has no value. As for the addition of Ibn Abi Shaybah 'that you should wash him', it is also denounced (Munkar) because he narrated it (4/142) via the path of Al-Ajlah from Al-Sha'bi as a Mursal report. Along with being Mursal, Al-Ajlah in it is weak, so there is no proof in his addition either. \n1. The Prophet (peace be upon him) only said this to him because Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him) had shown some annoyance due to being far from his people's home. Al-Tabarani narrated in 'Al-Kabir' and 'Al-Awsat' from Bashir himself saying: 'I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and caught up with him at Al-Baqi'. I heard him saying: Peace be upon the people of the abodes among the believers. My sandal strap broke, so he said: Fix your strap. I said: O Messenger of Allah, my celibacy has been long and I am far from my people's home. He said: O Bashir, will you not praise Allah who took you by your forelock from among Rabi'ah, a people who believe that were it not for them, the earth would have overturned with those on it?'

Al-Tahawi (1/293) narrated from it the story of the man with the Sibtiyyah sandals. Al-Hakim said: \"Authentic chain.\" Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, and Al-Hafiz confirmed it in \"Al-Fath\" (3/160). Ibn Majah narrated from Abdullah bin Uthman - who is Al-Basri - from Shu'bah that he said: A good (Jayyid) hadith. Ibn al-Qayyim quoted in \"Tahdhib al-Sunan\" (4/343) from Imam Ahmad that he said: Its chain is good. Al-Nawawi said in \"Al-Majmu'\" (5/312): \"Its chain is Hasan (Good).\" Ibn Hazm (5/142, 143) used it as evidence that a Muslim is not buried with a polytheist. In another place, he used it as evidence for the prohibition of walking with sandals between graves, as will be discussed in the commentary on Issue (126). 89 - The Sunnah is burial in the graveyard, because the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to bury the dead in the Baqi' graveyard, as the reports have become Mutawatir (mass transmitted) regarding that, and some have preceded in various contexts, the closest being the hadith of Ibn Al-Khasasiyyah which I cited in the previous issue. It has not been transmitted from any of the Salaf that he was buried anywhere other than a graveyard, except what is also Mutawatir that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was buried in his chamber, and that is one of his specific characteristics (peace and blessings be upon him), as indicated by the hadith of Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her): She said: \"When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) passed away, they differed regarding his burial. Abu Bakr said: I heard from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) something I have not forgotten. He said: 'Allah does not take the soul of a Prophet except in the place where he loves to be buried.' So they buried him in the place of his bedding.\" Narrated by Al-Tirmidhi (2/129) who said: \"A Gharib (strange) hadith, and Abd al-Rahman bin Abi Bakr Al-Maliki is weakened due to his memory.\" I say: However, the hadith is established due to its paths and supporting evidences: A - Narrated by Ibn Majah (1/498, 499), Ibn Sa'd (2/71), and Ibn Adi in 'Al-Kamil' (Folio 94/2) via the path of Ibn Abbas from Abu Bakr.",

Al-Tirmidhi also narrated it in \"Al-Shama'il\" (2/272) regarding the story of his death (peace and blessings be upon him). Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said (1/420): \"Its chain is authentic, but it is Mawquf (stopped at the Companion), but the one before it is more explicit in intent. If his burial in his house is interpreted as a specificity, it is not far-fetched to prohibit others from that; rather, it is pertinent, because continued burial in houses might turn them into graveyards, making prayer in them disliked (Makruh).\" Al-Bukhari deduced the dislike from his saying (peace and blessings be upon him): \"Perform some of your prayers in your houses, and do not take them as graves.\" He included it in the \"Chapter on the Dislike of Prayer in Graveyards\" from the hadith of Ibn Umar. Al-Hafiz said: \"The wording of Abu Huraira's hadith in Muslim is more explicit than the chapter's hadith, which is his saying: 'Do not make your houses graveyards,' for its apparent meaning implies a prohibition of burial in houses absolutely.\" 90 - Excluded from the above are martyrs in battle; they are buried in the places of their martyrdom and are not transported to graveyards, due to the hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) went out from Medina to the polytheists to fight them. My father Abdullah said: 'O Jabir son of Abdullah, do not worry about being among the onlookers of the people of Medina until you know what our matter comes to. For by Allah, were it not that I am leaving daughters behind me, I would have loved for you to be killed before me.' He said: So while I was among the onlookers, my aunt came with my father and my uncle, balancing them on a camel used for irrigation. She entered Medina with them to bury them in our graveyards - when a man caught up calling out: 'Behold! The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) commands you to return the slain to be buried in their places of death where they were killed.' So we returned with them and buried them where they were killed.\"",

It was previously mentioned in Issue (17, p. 14). 92 - Burial is not permissible in the following situations except for necessity: A - Burial during the three times [forbidden for prayer], due to the hadith of Uqbah bin Amir mentioned previously (p. 130) with the wording: \"There are three hours (times) during which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) forbade us to pray or to bury our dead: when the sun begins to rise until it is high, when the shade of a spear stands still at noon until the sun passes the meridian, and when the sun inclines to setting until it sets.\" The hadith clearly indicates what we mentioned. Ibn Hazm adopted this view in \"Al-Muhalla\" (5/114-115) as did other scholars. Among the far-fetched, indeed invalid interpretations, is the saying of some: \"His saying: (bury) means pray [the funeral prayer].\" Abu Al-Hasan Al-Sindi said: \"It is not hidden that this is a distant meaning that does not come to mind from the wording of the hadith. Some said: 'One says he buried him (Qabarahu) if he put him in the grave, and one does not say he buried him (Qabarahu) if he prayed over him.'

This is weak because the funeral prayer is not disliked at this time by consensus, so it is not permissible to interpret the hadith in a way that contradicts the consensus. Rather, the correct view is that its meaning is intentionally delaying the burial until these times, just as it is disliked to intentionally delay the Asr prayer until the yellowing of the sun without excuse... As for if the burial happens during these times without intent, it is not disliked.' I say: This is an interpretation with no evidence. The hadith is absolute and includes the intentional and others. The truth is the impermissibility of burial even for the unintentional; whoever is overtaken by it [the time] should wait until the time of dislike passes. As for his claim that the funeral prayer is not disliked during such times by consensus, it is a delusion from him (may Allah have mercy on him). The issue is disputed, and the correct view regarding it is dislike (Karahah), contrary to the alleged consensus. This has been previously clarified in Issue (89) in the commentary on it (p. 130). =",

So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) reprimanded that a man be buried at night until he is prayed over, unless a person is compelled to do that.\" Narrated by Muslim and others, and it was previously mentioned in Issue (35, p. 56). The hadith clearly indicates what we mentioned. It is the view of Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) in a narration from him mentioned in \"Al-Insaf\" (2/547). He said: \"He should not do it except out of necessity. And in another [narration] from him: It is disliked.\" I say: The first is closer to the apparent meaning of his saying \"reprimanded\" (zajara), for it is stronger in prohibition than the word \"forbade\" (naha) which can be interpreted as dislike, although the default ruling for it is prohibition (Tahrim), and there is nothing to divert it to dislike. (1)",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) However, what we mentioned is complicated by his saying in the hadith \"until he is prayed over.\" For its apparent meaning also indicates the permissibility of burial at night after the prayer, because that is the goal of the prohibition. If it is achieved, the prohibition is lifted. But this is countered by his saying \"unless a person is compelled to do that,\" for the demonstrative pronoun in it refers to the prohibited act, which is burial at night before the prayer, except in case of necessity, then it is permissible. This is very far-fetched, because it is easy to imagine the mourners being compelled to bury at night for many reasons as will come from Ibn Hazm, but we cannot imagine in any way that they would be compelled to bury him without praying over him. What makes it even more remote is that this meaning renders the restriction of \"night\" useless, since burial before prayer, just as it is not permissible at night, is likewise not permissible during the day. If it were permissible at night for necessity, it would be permissible during the day for its sake with no difference. So what is the benefit of the restriction to \"night\" then? There is no doubt that the benefit does not appear strongly unless we prefer what we initially deduced regarding the impermissibility of burial at night. The explanation of that is: Burial at night is a presumed cause for few people praying over the deceased. So he forbade burial at night so that he would be prayed over during the day, because people during the day are more active in praying over him. Thus, a large number of people praying over him is achieved; this large number is one of the objectives of the Sharia and is more hopeful for the acceptance of their intercession for the deceased, as previously explained in \"Issue (63), (p. 96).\" Al-Nawawi said in \"Sharh Muslim\": \"As for the prohibition of burial at night until he is prayed over, it was said the reason is that burial during the day is attended by many people who pray over him, while only individuals attend at night. And it was said because they used to do that due to the poor quality of the shroud, so it wouldn't be noticeable at night. The beginning and end of the hadith support this. Al-Qadi said: Both reasons are correct. He said: It is apparent that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) intended both together. He said: And other things have been said.\" I say: If it is known that the reason is the small number of worshipers and fear regarding the poor quality of the shroud, the result is that if he was prayed over during the day, then his burial was delayed for an excuse until the night, there is no impediment to burying him in it due to the absence of the cause and the realization of the goal, which is the large number of worshipers. Based on this, is it permissible to delay burying the deceased during the day to achieve the mentioned goal? Al-San'ani considered this good in \"Subul al-Salam\" (2/166), but I do not see that, because the mentioned cause is restricted, so it is not permissible to extend it to the day due to the great difference between the two circumstances, for =",

The evidence is the hadith of Ibn Abbas: \"That the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) placed a man in his grave at night, and a lamp was lit in his grave.\" Narrated by Ibn Majah (1/464) and Al-Tirmidhi (2/157) more completely, and he said: \"A Hasan (Good) hadith.\"",
    "foot_note": "1. = Fewness at night is a natural matter, unlike the day where abundance is natural. Furthermore, this abundance has no limit, so the more the deceased is delayed, the greater the abundance. Therefore, we see some affluent people who love to show off and seek reputation, even at the expense of the deceased, delaying him for a day or two so that the largest possible number of mourners attend the funeral. If the permissibility of that were stated, it would lead to opposing the Lawgiver in his command to hasten with the funeral as previously explained in Issue (17) (p. 13) due to the reason of abundance which has no control. After this, the answer to the problem I raised regarding his saying \"until he is prayed over\" becomes clear to us, as it appeared that the meaning is until he is prayed over during the day for the large congregation. Thus, it becomes clear that the demonstrative pronoun in his saying \"unless a person is compelled to do that\" refers to burial at night even with few worshipers, not to burial while abandoning the prayer over him entirely. So reflect, for it is worthy of reflection. Then Al-Nawawi said in \"Sharh Muslim\": \"Scholars differed regarding burial at night. Al-Hasan Al-Basri disliked it except for necessity, and this hadith is used as evidence for him. The majority of scholars from the Salaf and Khalaf said: It is not disliked. They used as evidence that Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) and a group of the Salaf were buried at night without objection, and the hadith of the black woman: And the man who used to clean the mosque who died at night and they buried him at night. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asked them about him, and they said: He died at night and we buried him at night. He said: Why did you not inform me? They said: It was dark. And he did not rebuke them. They answered regarding this hadith that the prohibition was for leaving the prayer, and he did not forbid mere burial at night, but rather for leaving the prayer, or for the fewness of worshipers, or for the poor shroud, or for the combination as preceded.\" I say: The first answer, that the prohibition was for leaving the prayer, is incorrect, because if it were so, there would be no difference between burial at night or day as previously explained. Rather, the correct view is that the prohibition was indeed for the two matters mentioned previously in Al-Qadi's speech. Therefore, Ibn Hazm chose that no one should be buried at night except out of necessity. He used this hadith as evidence for that, then answered the hadiths mentioned regarding burial at night and similar reports by saying (5/114-115): \"Everyone who was buried at night, including him (peace be upon him), his wives, and his companions (may Allah be pleased with them), that was only for a necessity that obligated it, such as fear of the heat for those attending - and it is severe in Medina - or fear of change [decomposition], or other things that permit burial at night. It is not lawful for anyone to think otherwise of them (may Allah be pleased with them).\" Then he narrated the dislike of burial at night from Saeed bin Al-Musayyib. I say: It is possible that some of those buried at night had been prayed over during the day, and in that case there is no contradiction based on what was previously explained. That is the reality in his case (peace be upon him), for they prayed over him on Tuesday and then buried him on the night of Wednesday, as Ibn Hisham mentioned in his Sirah (4/314) from Ibn Ishaq. And Allah knows best.",

This is a specific terminology of Al-Tirmidhi that if he says: \"Hadith Hasan,\" he only intends Hasan due to others, as he himself stated in \"Al-Ilal\" mentioned at the end of his book. A witness (supporting narration) has come for it as follows, and therefore Ibn Al-Qattan's criticism of him, which was recounted by the author of \"Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi,\" does not apply to Al-Tirmidhi's grading of Hasan. As for the witness, it is from the hadith of Jabir bin Abdullah. Narrated by Abu Dawud (2/63), Al-Hakim (1/368), and Al-Bayhaqi (4/53). Al-Hakim said: \"Authentic on the condition of Muslim.\" Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, and Al-Nawawi exceeded them both, saying in \"Al-Majmu'\" (5/302): \"Abu Dawud narrated it with a chain on the condition of Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\" I say: All of that is incorrect, for the pivot of its chain is Muhammad bin Muslim Al-Ta'ifi. Although he is trustworthy in himself, he was weak in his memory. Therefore, the two Sheikhs did not use him as a primary proof; rather, Al-Bukhari narrated from him in a suspended form (Ta'liq), and Muslim as supporting evidence (Istishhad). It is amazing that Al-Hakim and Al-Dhahabi were aware of some of this, for Al-Mizzi mentioned that this Al-Ta'ifi has only one hadith in Muslim. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: \"And it is a supporting narration in his [Muslim's book], as Al-Hakim stated.\" Similarly, Al-Dhahabi stated in his biography in \"Al-Mizan\" that Muslim narrated from him as a follow-up (Muta'ba'ah). It has another witness from the hadith of Abu Dharr similar to it. Al-Hakim narrated it with a chain containing an unnamed man, while the rest of its narrators are trustworthy. 93 - It is obligatory to deepen, widen, and improve the grave. There are two hadiths regarding this: First: From Hisham bin Amir who said: \"On the Day of Uhud, Muslims were stricken (killed) and people suffered wounds. (So we said: O Messenger of Allah, digging for each person is difficult for us), (so how do you command us?). He said: Dig, widen, (deepen), (and improve), and bury two and three in a grave, and prioritize the one who knew the most Quran. (He said: My father was the third of three, and he knew the most Quran, so he was prioritized).\"",

The phrasing belongs to Al-Nasa'i, and all the additions are his in one narration. They are also present in Ahmad except for the first one. The third addition is in Abu Dawud and Al-Bayhaqi. The fourth is in Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and Al-Bayhaqi. The fifth is in Al-Tirmidhi, and he said: \"A Hasan Sahih hadith.\" I say: The pivot of its chain is Humaid bin Hilal. Ayyub Al-Sakhtiyani narrated it from him in three ways: First: From him from Hisham bin Amir. Second: From him from Abu Al-Dahma' from Hisham. Third: From him from Sa'd bin Hisham from his father Hisham. Sulaiman bin Al-Mughirah followed him on the first way from Humaid with it. Narrated by Al-Nasa'i, Al-Bayhaqi (3/413), and Ahmad.

This way is more likely to me for this follow-up, and it is more likely than the first follow-up for two reasons: First: Muslim used Sulaiman bin Al-Mughirah as proof but Al-Bukhari did not; he narrated from him coupled with others. Unlike Jarir bin Hazim, for both Muslim and Al-Bukhari used him as proof. Second: It contains an addition from a trustworthy narrator, which is considered, so it was one of the preponderating factors. Based on this, the chain of the hadith is authentic as Al-Tirmidhi said, and it is on the condition of the two Sheikhs.

However, some Imams disapproved of him naming the daughter \"Ruqayyah\". Al-Bukhari said in \"Al-Tarikh Al-Awsat\": \"I do not know what this is? For Ruqayyah died while the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was at Badr and did not witness her [funeral].\" Al-Hafiz preferred in \"Al-Fath\" that the error is from Hammad bin Salamah, and that she was Umm Kulthum, the wife of Uthman, so refer to it. This is what Al-Tahawi asserted in \"Al-Mushkil\" and said: \"Her death was in the year nine of the Hijra\" (2).",

He said: It is known that Abu Talha (may Allah be pleased with him) was a stranger [non-Mahram] to the daughters of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), but he was among the righteous of those present, and there was no Mahram man there except the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), so perhaps he had an excuse regarding descending into her grave. Likewise her husband. It is known that her sister Fatima and others of her Mahrams and other women were there, so this indicates that women have no role in entering the grave and burial.\" Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Fath\": =",

So he prayed over him, then inserted him into the grave from the foot of the grave and said: This is from the Sunnah.\" Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in \"Al-Musannaf\" (4/130) and Abu Dawud (2/69), and via his path Al-Bayhaqi (4/54) who said: This is an authentic chain, and since he said: 'This is from the Sunnah', it becomes Marfu' (elevated to the Prophet).\" I say: He then narrated witnesses for it from the hadith of Ibn Abbas and others, and said: \"This is what is well-known among the people of Hijaz.\" Then he cited two hadiths stating that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was inserted from the direction of the Qibla, and he weakened them, which is as he mentioned. Al-Shafi'i (may Allah have mercy on him) criticized the second hadith textually as well, arguing that it is practically impossible. He said in \"Al-Umm\" (1/241): \"Trustworthy companions of ours informed me that the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is on the right of the entrant from the house, adhering to the wall. The wall next to which the Lahd is, is the Qibla of the house, and his Lahd is under the wall. So how can he be inserted sideways while the Lahd is adhering to the wall with nothing to stand on? It is not possible except to slide him gently or enter from opposite the Qibla. Matters of the dead and their insertion are among the well-known matters among us due to the frequency of death and the presence of Imams and trustworthy people. It is among the general matters where a hadith is dispensed with, and the hadith in it would be like assigning a task based on the general public's knowledge of it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), the Muhajirun, and the Ansar were among us, transmitted generally from the general public without differing in that the deceased is slid gently.

Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) held this view (5/144-145). It is strange that the general books of Fiqh that I have seen or reviewed on this occasion did not address this issue, neither negating nor affirming. This is one of many proofs that the Faqih cannot do without the books of Sunnah, contrary to what the partisan followers of Madhhabs think, that books of Fiqh suffice over books of Hadith, and even over the Book of Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, high above what the wrongdoers say.

It is one of the two hadiths that Al-Bayhaqi weakened as indicated at the beginning of the issue. Therefore, Al-Nawawi (5/295) rejected Al-Tirmidhi's grading of it as Hasan, saying: \"Al-Tirmidhi's statement that it is Hasan is not accepted because Al-Hajjaj bin Artah is weak by the agreement of Hadith scholars.\" Al-Zayla'i said: =",

    "foot_note": "1. (1) As for the recommendation by some late jurists to say in the first handful (From it We created you), in the second (And into it We return you), and in the third (And from it We bring you out another time), it has no basis in any of the hadiths we indicated above. As for Al-Nawawi's saying (5/293-294): It may be evidenced by the hadith of Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"When Umm Kulthum, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), was placed in the grave, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (From it We created you, and into it We return you, and from it We bring you out another time).\" Narrated by Imam Ahmad from the narration of Ubaidullah bin Zahr from Ali bin Zaid bin Jud'an from Al-Qasim, and all three are weak, but weak hadiths are used for virtues of deeds...\" The answer to this is from several aspects: First: The hadith does not contain the detailed [practice] alleged to be recommended, so there is no proof in it at all even if its chain were authentic. Second: The mentioned detail is not established in the Shari'ah as being among the virtues of deeds so that it can be said this hadith acts upon it because it is regarding virtues of deeds. Rather, permitting action by it means establishing the legitimacy of an act by a weak hadith, and that is not permissible because legitimacy's lowest degree is recommendation (Istihbab): which is one of the five rulings that are not established except by authentic evidence, and weak [evidence] is of no avail in it by the agreement of scholars. Third: The hadith is very weak, rather it is fabricated (Mawdu') in the criticism of Ibn Hibban. It is in \"Musnad Ahmad\" (5/254) via Ubaidullah bin Zahr from Ali bin Yazid, who is Al-Alhani, and Al-Nawawi's saying \"Ali bin Zaid bin Jud'an\" is a mistake, contradicting what is in the \"Musnad\". Ibn Hibban said: \"Ubaidullah bin Zahr narrates fabrications from trustworthy narrators, and if he narrates from Ali bin Yazid, he brings calamities. And if Ubaidullah, Ali bin Yazid, and Al-Qasim Abu Abd al-Rahman gather in a chain of a report, that report is nothing but what their hands wrought\"!

Prioritizing Al-Tammar's hadith is not complete unless the defect of Al-Qasim's hadith is explained, or at least that it is below it in authenticity. That is the case here, for its defect is Amr bin Uthman bin Hani, who is 'Mastur' (hidden/unknown condition) as Al-Hafiz said in \"Al-Taqrib\", and no one authenticated him at all. So Al-Hakim's authentication of his hadith is from his known leniency, and Al-Dhahabi's agreement with him is one of his many oversights not hidden from those who track his speech in \"Talkhis Al-Mustadrak\". Furthermore, even if it were authentic, it does not contradict Al-Tammar's hadith, because his saying \"Mabtuh\" (spread/level) does not mean flat, but rather covered with \"Batha\" which is small pebbles as in \"Al-Nihayah\", and it is apparent in the report itself: \"spread with the pebbles of the red courtyard\". This does not negate humping. Ibn al-Qayyim combined the two hadiths with this, saying in \"Al-Zad\": \"His grave is humped, spread with the pebbles of the red courtyard, neither built up nor plastered with clay, and likewise were the graves of his two companions.\" Third: To mark it with a stone or similiar to bury near it those of his family who die, due to the hadith of Al-Muttalib bin Abi Wada'ah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"When Uthman bin Maz'un died, he was brought out in his funeral and buried. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) ordered a man to bring him a stone, but he could not carry it. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) went to it and rolled up his sleeves from his arms.

Then he carried it and placed it at his head, and said: I mark with it the grave of my brother, and I will bury near it those who die of my family.\" Narrated by Abu Dawud (2/69) and from him Al-Bayhaqi (3/412) with a Hasan chain as Al-Hafiz said (5/229).

He said: And there comes to him (in a narration: appears to him) a man with a handsome face, handsome clothes, and a good scent, who says: Rejoice with what pleases you, (rejoice with pleasure from Allah, and gardens in which is enduring bounty). This is your day which you were promised. He says to him: (And you, may Allah give you glad tidings",

They sit from him as far as the eye can see. Then the Angel of Death comes until he sits at his head and says: O wicked soul, come out to anger from Allah and wrath.

(Every angel between the heaven and earth and every angel in the heaven curses him, and the gates of heaven are closed.

There are two hadiths regarding this: First: From Qurrah Al-Muzani (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"When the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) sat, a group of his companions would sit with him. Among them was a man who had a young son whom he would bring from behind his back and seat in front of him. (The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: Do you love him? He said: O Messenger of Allah, may Allah love you as I love him!). Then he [the son] died, and the man refrained from attending the circle due to the memory of his son, and he grieved for him. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) missed him and said: Why do I not see So-and-so? They said: O Messenger of Allah, his little son whom you saw has died. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) met him and asked him about his son. He informed him that he had died. So he consoled him for him, then said: O So-and-so? Which is more beloved to you: that you enjoy him for your lifespan, or that you do not come tomorrow to any gate of the gates of Paradise except that you find he has preceded you to it and opens it for you? He said: O Prophet of Allah! Rather, that he precedes me to the gate of Paradise and opens it for me is more beloved to me. He said: Then that is for you. (A man (from the Ansar) said: O Messenger of Allah (may Allah make me your ransom), is it for him specifically or for all of us? He said: Rather, for all of you).\" Narrated by Al-Nasa'i (1/296) - the context is his - Ibn Hibban in his \"Sahih\", Al-Hakim (1/384), and Ahmad (5/35).

The hadith has a witness in \"Al-Majma\" (3/10). Second: From Anas bin Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) who said: \"Whoever consoles his believing brother in his affliction, Allah will clothe him in a green garment by which he will be envied (honored) on the Day of Resurrection. It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what is 'yujbar' (honored)? He said: He will be envied (yughbat).\" Narrated by Al-Khatib in \"Tarikh Baghdad\" (7/397) and Ibn Asakir in \"Tarikh Dimashq\" (15/91 / 1). It has a witness from Talhah bin Ubaidullah bin Kurayz as a Maqtu' narration. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in \"Al-Musannaf\" (4/164). It is a Hasan (good) hadith with the sum of the two paths as I clarified in \"Irwa' Al-Ghalil fi Takhrij Ahadith Manar Al-Sabil\" No. (756). Know that relying on these two hadiths - especially the first one - for condolences is better than relying on the hadith: \"Whoever consoles an afflicted person has the like of his reward,\" even though the majority of authors followed it, because it is a weak hadith from all its paths as explained by Al-Nawawi in \"Al-Majmu'\" (5/305) and Al-Asqalani in \"Al-Talkhis\" (5/251) and in \"Irwa' Al-Ghalil\" (No. 757). 112 - He should console them with what he thinks will comfort them, restrain their grief, and encourage them to contentment and patience, from what is established from him (peace be upon him), if he knows and recalls it. Otherwise, with whatever good words are easy for him that achieve the purpose and do not contradict the Sharia. There are hadiths regarding this: First: From Usama bin Zaid who said: \"Some of his daughters sent to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him): That a son of hers, or a daughter (in a narration: Umaymah bint Zainab) (1) was dying, so witness us.

A group of Imam Ahmad's companions held the view we mentioned that condolence is not limited by a time limit, as in (Al-Insaf) (2/564). It is also a view in the Shafi'i school.

They said: Rather, they should go about their needs, and whoever meets them consoles them. There is no difference between men and women in the dislike of sitting for it). The text of Imam Al-Shafi'i referred to by Al-Nawawi is in the book (Al-Umm) (1/248): (And I dislike the gathering places for mourning (Ma'atim), which is the gathering, even if they do not have crying, for that renews grief and imposes costs, along with the narration passed regarding it). It seems he refers to this hadith of Jarir. Al-Nawawi said: (The author and others used another proof for it, which is that it is an innovation). Similarly, Ibn Al-Humam stated in Sharh Al-Hidayah (1/473) the dislike of hosting a feast of food from the deceased's family and said: (It is an ugly innovation).

Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful.') [Surah Al-Hashr 10]. As for the hadiths, they are very numerous. Some have passed, and some will come in [the section on] visiting graves, and the Prophet's supplication for them and his command for that. Among them is his saying (peace be upon him): (The supplication of a Muslim man for his brother in his absence is answered. At his head is an entrusted angel; whenever he supplicates for his brother with good, the angel entrusted with him says: Amen, and for you the like). Narrated by Muslim (8/86, 87) - context is his - Abu Dawud (1/240), and Ahmad (6/452) from the hadith of Abu Darda. Indeed, the funeral prayer itself is largely a witness to that, because most of it is supplication for the deceased and seeking forgiveness for him, as previously explained. Second: The guardian (Wali) of the deceased making up the fast of a vow (Nadhr) on his behalf. There are hadiths regarding this: First: From Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (Whoever dies and has fasting due upon him, his guardian fasts on his behalf). Narrated by Al-Bukhari (4/156), Muslim (3/155), and Abu Dawud (1/376). From his path Al-Bayhaqi (6/279), Al-Tahawi in Mushkil Al-Athar (3/140, 141), and Ahmad (6/69). Second: From Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him): (That a woman rode the sea and vowed that if Allah, Blessed and Exalted, saved her, she would fast a month. Allah, Mighty and Majestic, saved her, but she did not fast until she died. A female relative of hers [either her sister or daughter] came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and mentioned that to him. He said: [Do you see if she had a debt, would you pay it off? She said: Yes. He said: Then the debt of Allah is more deserving to be paid], [so] pay it off [on behalf of your mother]).

However, the first hadith, by its generality, indicates something additional to that, which is that he fasts for him the obligatory fast [Ramadan] as well. The Shafi'is held this view, and it is the school of Ibn Hazm (7/2, 8) and others. The Hanbalis held the first view [only vows], and it is the text of Imam Ahmad. Abu Dawud said in (Al-Masa'il) (96): (I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal say: One does not fast for the dead except in a vow). His followers interpreted the first hadith as referring to the fast of a vow, evidenced by what Amrah narrated: That her mother died and she had [fasts] from Ramadan due. She asked Aisha: Shall I make it up for her? She said: No, but give charity on her behalf in place of every day, half a Sa' for every poor person. Narrated by Al-Tahawi (3/142) and Ibn Hazm (7/4) - wording is his - with a chain Ibn Al-Turkumani said is: (Authentic). Al-Bayhaqi weakened it, then Al-Asqalani. If they meant weakening it from this specific route, there is no basis for it, and if they meant another, it does not harm it. And evidenced by what Saeed bin Jubayr narrated from Ibn Abbas who said: (If a man falls ill in Ramadan then dies and did not fast, food is given on his behalf and he does not have to make it up. If he had a vow upon him, his guardian makes it up for him). Narrated by Abu Dawud with an authentic chain on the condition of the two Sheikhs. It has another route similar to it in Ibn Hazm (7/7) who authenticated its chain. And it has a third route in Al-Tahawi (3/142), but it appears something fell from its text from the scribe or printer, corrupting the meaning. I say: This detailed explanation adopted by the Mother of the Believers and the Ink of the Nation Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them), and followed by the Imam of the Sunnah Ahmad bin Hanbal, is what the soul finds tranquility in and the chest opens to. It is the fairest of opinions on this issue and the most moderate. It involves acting upon all the hadiths without rejecting any of them, with the correct understanding of them, especially the first one. The Mother of the Believers did not understand from it that absolute generality covering the fast of Ramadan, and she is its narrator. It is established that the narrator of a hadith knows best the meaning of what they narrated, especially if what they understood agrees with the rules and principles of Sharia, as is the case here. The verifier Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) clarified this, saying in (I'lam Al-Muwaqqi'in) (3/554) after mentioning the hadith and authenticating it: =",

Another group refused that and said: Neither vow nor obligation is fasted for him. A group differentiated and said: The vow is fasted for him but not the original obligation. This is the saying of Ibn Abbas and his companions, and it is the correct one, because the obligation of fasting runs the course of prayer. Just as no one prays for anyone, and no one becomes Muslim for anyone, likewise fasting. As for the vow, it is a commitment in the dhimmah (liability) similar to a debt, so the guardian's payment of it is accepted just as he pays his debt. This is pure jurisprudence. The consistent application of this is that Hajj is not performed for him, nor Zakat paid for him unless he was excused in delaying it, just as the guardian feeds on behalf of one who broke the fast in Ramadan due to an excuse. As for the one who breaks the fast without any excuse at all, the performance of others for the obligations of Allah that he neglected does not benefit him. He was the one commanded with them as a test and trial, not the guardian. So the repentance of one does not benefit another, nor his Islam for him, nor the performance of prayer for him, nor other obligations of Allah Almighty that he neglected until he died).

    "foot_note": "1. (1) Al-Shawkani said in (Nayl Al-Awtar) (4/79): (The hadiths of the chapter indicate that charity from the child reaches the parents after their death without a will from them, and its reward reaches them. Thus, the generality of His saying: (And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives) is specified by these hadiths. But the hadiths of the chapter only contain the reaching of charity from the child, and it is established that a person's child is from his striving, so there is no need to claim specification. As for from other than the child, the apparent meaning from the Quranic generalities is that its reward does not reach the deceased. So one should stop at that until evidence necessitating its specification comes). I say: This is the truth necessitated by scientific rules, that the Verse is on its generality and that the reward of charity and other things reaches from the child to the parent because he is from his striving, unlike other than the child. However, Al-Nawawi and others reported Consensus (Ijma') that charity counts for the deceased and its reward reaches him. They said (the deceased) generally and did not restrict it to the parent. If this Consensus is valid, it would be a specifier for the generalities Al-Shawkani pointed to regarding charity, and everything else would remain under the generality, like fasting, Quran recitation, and similar acts of worship. But I am in great doubt regarding the validity of the mentioned Consensus, for two reasons: First: That Consensus in the technical sense cannot be realized in other than matters known from religion by necessity, as verified by prominent scholars like Ibn Hazm in (Usul Al-Ahkam), Al-Shawkani in (Irshad Al-Fuhul), Professor Abdul Wahhab Khallaf in his book (Usul Al-Fiqh), and others. Imam Ahmad pointed to this in his famous statement refuting those who claim Consensus - narrated from him by his son Abdullah bin Ahmad in (Al-Masa'il). Second: That I have reviewed many issues in which they reported Consensus, and found disagreement in them to be known! Rather, I saw the majority opinion contrary to the claim of Consensus in them. If I wanted to list examples of that, the discussion would be long and we would deviate from our subject. Suffice it now to mention one example, which is Al-Nawawi reporting Consensus that funeral prayer is not disliked in the disliked times! Yet the disagreement on it is old and known, and most people of knowledge hold the contrary to the alleged Consensus, as previously verified in Issue (87). Another nearby example will come for you, God willing. =",

    "foot_note": "1. = Some went to drawing an analogy between non-parents and parents. This is an invalid analogy for several reasons: First: It contradicts Quranic generalities like His saying {And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for [the benefit of] his own soul} [Fatir: 18] and other verses that link success and entering Paradise to righteous deeds. There is no doubt that the parent purifies himself by raising his child and caring for him, so he has his reward, unlike others. Second: It is an analogy with a discrepancy (Qiyas ma'a al-fariq) if you remember that the Lawgiver made the child from the parent's earning as in the hadith of Aisha, so he is not an earning for others. Allah the Mighty and Majestic says: {Every soul, for what it has earned, will be retained} [Al-Muddathir: 38] and says {For it is what it has earned, and against it is what it has committed} [Al-Baqarah: 286]. Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir said in the interpretation of His saying {And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives} [Al-Najm: 39]: (Meaning just as he does not bear the burden of another, likewise he does not attain reward except what he himself earned. From this noble verse, Al-Shafi'i (may Allah have mercy on him) and those who followed him deduced that the gift of the reward of recitation does not reach the dead because it is not from their deed nor their earning. For this reason, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did not recommend it to his nation, nor urged them to it, nor guided them to it by text or indication. Nor was that reported from any of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). If it were good, they would have preceded us to it. The chapter of acts of worship is restricted to texts and is not handled with types of analogies and opinions). Al-Izz bin Abd al-Salam said in (Al-Fatawa) (24/2 - year 1692): (Whoever performs an act of obedience to Allah Almighty, then gifts its reward to a living or dead person, its reward does not transfer to him, since {there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives}. If he initiates the obedience intending it to fall on behalf of the deceased, it does not fall on his behalf, except in what the Sharia excluded like charity, fasting, and Hajj). What Ibn Kathir mentioned from Al-Shafi'i (may Allah have mercy on him) is the opinion of most scholars and a group of Hanafis as quoted by Al-Zubaidi in (Sharh Al-Ihya) (10/369). * Third: That if this analogy were correct, it would imply the recommendation of gifting reward to the dead. If it were so, the Salaf would have done it, because they are more eager for reward than us without doubt, yet they did not do that as per Ibn Kathir's words. This indicates that the mentioned analogy is incorrect, which is the point. Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in (Al-Ikhtiyarat Al-Ilmiyyah) (p. 54): (It was not the habit of the Salaf that if they prayed a voluntary prayer, or fasted a voluntary fast, or performed a voluntary Hajj, or read the Quran, they would gift the reward of that to the Muslims' dead. So one should not deviate from the path of the Salaf for it is better and more complete). The Sheikh (may Allah have mercy on him) has another opinion on the issue, in which he contradicted what he mentioned just now about the Salaf, where he held that the deceased benefits from all acts of worship from others!

    "foot_note": "1. = Analogy in purely devotional matters, especially what was contrary to what the Righteous Salaf (may Allah be pleased with them) practiced. The scholar Sayyid Muhammad Rashid Rida summarized his words in (Tafsir Al-Manar) (8/254-270) then refuted him with a good, strong refutation. Let whoever wishes to expand on the issue refer to it. Many innovators have exploited this saying and used it as a pretext to fight the Sunnah, arguing with the Sheikh and his student against the helpers of the Sunnah and its followers. Those innovators ignored or pretended to ignore that the helpers of the Sunnah do not imitate a specific man in the religion of Allah Almighty as those do! Nor do they prefer over the truth that has become clear to them the saying of any scholar, no matter how good their belief in his knowledge and righteousness is. They only look at the saying, not the speaker, and at the evidence, not imitation, keeping before their eyes the saying of the Imam of the abode of Hijrah: (There is no one among us except he refutes and is refuted, except the owner of this grave)! And he said: (Everyone's saying is taken or rejected except the owner of this grave). If it is accepted among the people of knowledge that every belief or opinion one adopts in this life has an effect on his behavior, if good then good, and if evil then evil, then it is also accepted that the effect indicates the effector, and that one of them is linked to the other, good or evil as we mentioned. Based on this, we do not doubt that this saying has a bad effect on whoever holds or adopts it. For example, its holder relies on others to obtain reward and high ranks, knowing that people gift good deeds hundreds of times a day to all living and dead Muslims, and he is one of them. So why shouldn't he dispense with his own striving and earning by relying on others' deeds! Do you not see, for example, that some Sheikhs who live on the earnings of some of their students do not strive themselves to obtain their daily sustenance by the sweat of their brow and the toil of their right hand! The only reason for that is they dispensed with that by others' earnings! So they relied on it and left work. This is an observed matter in material things, comprehensible in spiritual things as is the case in this issue. Would that it stopped there and did not exceed to what is more dangerous. There is a saying permitting Hajj on behalf of others even if not excused, like most rich people who abandon obligations. This opinion leads them to be lenient regarding Hajj and neglecting it, because he rationalizes it and says inwardly: They will perform Hajj for me after my death! Indeed, there is something even more harmful, which is the saying of the obligation to drop prayer [by payment/fidya] for the deceased who abandoned it! This is one of the major factors for some Muslims abandoning prayer, because he rationalizes that people will drop it for him after his death! To other sayings whose bad effect on society is not hidden. It is obligatory on the scholar who wants reform to discard these sayings for contradicting the texts of Sharia and its good objectives. Compare the effect of these sayings with the effect of the saying of those who stop at the texts and do not exit them by interpretation or analogy; you will find the difference as [clear as] the sun. For he who does not take such referred opinions cannot rely on others for deed and reward, because he sees that nothing saves him except his deed, and he has no reward except what he himself strove for. Rather, it is expected of him to strive as much as possible to leave behind a good trace whose reward comes to him while he is alone in his grave, instead of those illusory good deeds. This is one of the many reasons for the advancement of the Salaf and our backwardness, and Allah's victory for them and His forsaking of us. We ask Allah Almighty to guide us as He guided them, and grant us victory as He granted them victory.",

The addition is for Abu Dawud and Al-Bayhaqi. Second: From Abu Qatadah who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (The best of what a man leaves behind him are three: a righteous child who prays for him, a charity which runs [continues] and its reward reaches him, and knowledge which is acted upon after him). Narrated by Ibn Majah (1/106), Ibn Hibban in his (Sahih) (No. 84, 85), Al-Tabarani in (Al-Mu'jam Al-Saghir) (p. 79), and Ibn Abd al-Barr in (Jami' Bayan al-Ilm) (1/15). Its chain is authentic as Al-Mundhiri said in (Al-Targhib) (1/58). Third: From Abu Huraira also who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (Indeed, among what follows the believer of his deed and good deeds after his death are: knowledge he taught and spread, a righteous child he left, a copy of the Quran (Mushaf) he bequeathed, a mosque he built, a house for the wayfarer he built, a river he caused to flow, or a charity he brought out from his wealth during his health and life; it follows him after his death).",

Al-Khattabi said in (Al-Ma'alim): (In it is evidence that fasting, prayer, and what falls under their meaning of physical actions do not accept deputation. It may be used as evidence by those who hold that if someone performs Hajj for a deceased, the Hajj is in reality for the Hajji (performer) not the one performed for, but the supplication reaches him [the deceased], and he has the reward in the money he gave if Hajj was performed for him with money). \n2. Restricted by 'righteous' because reward is not obtained from other than that. As for the burden, it does not attach to the parent from his child's sin if his intention was to achieve good. Mentioning supplication for him is to urge supplication for the father, not because it is a restriction, for the reward is obtained for the parent from his righteous child whenever he does a righteous deed, whether he supplicated for his father or not, like one who plants a tree gets reward from eating its fruit whether the eater supplicated for him or not. Likewise the mother. Thus in (Mabariq Al-Azhar fi Sharh Mashariq Al-Anwar) by Ibn Al-Malik.",

Fourth: From Jurrīr ibn ‘Abdullāh (may Allah be pleased with him), he said: “We were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ at the beginning of the day when some barefooted, naked men from Muḍar came, wearing only swords, all of them from Muḍar. The face of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ changed when he saw their poverty. He entered, then came out, and ordered Bilāl to call to prayer and perform the Ẓuhr prayer. Then he ascended a small pulpit and delivered a sermon, praising Allah and extolling Him. He said: ‘As for what follows, Allah has revealed in His Book: “O mankind, fear your Lord who created you from a single soul and created from it its mate, and dispersed from both many men and women. And fear Allah through whom you ask one another, and [respect] the wombs. Indeed Allah is ever Watchful over you” [al-Nisā’: 1]. And the verse in al-Ḥashr: “[O you who believe, fear Allah. Let every soul look to what it has sent forth for tomorrow. And fear Allah. Indeed Allah is Acquainted with what you do]” [al-Ḥashr: 18], “[And be not like those who forgot Allah, so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient]… [The companions of the Fire are not equal to the companions of Paradise; the companions of Paradise are the successful]” [al-Ḥashr: 19–20].’ \n\nHe encouraged giving charity before it is too late. A man gave from his dinar, his dirham, his clothing, a sa‘ of barley, a sa‘ of dates, until the Prophet ﷺ said: ‘Let no one belittle any act of charity,’ even if it is half a date. The people delayed until the anger appeared on his face. Then a man from the Ansār gave a bowl [of gold in some narrations], which he could hardly hold, and handed it to the Prophet ﷺ on the pulpit, saying: ‘O Messenger of Allah, this is in the way of Allah.’ The Prophet ﷺ accepted it. Abu Bakr then stood and gave, followed by ‘Umar, then the Muhājirūn and Ansār, giving continuously. I saw heaps of food and clothing, and the face of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ lit up as if it shone like gold. The Prophet ﷺ said: ‘Whoever introduces a good practice in Islam will have its reward and the reward of those who act upon it after him, without diminishing their reward. And whoever introduces a bad practice in Islam will bear its burden.’",

Regarding this, there are hadiths: First: On the authority of Buraydah ibn al-Husam, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (I used to forbid you from visiting graves, so visit them, [for they remind you of the Hereafter], [and let their visit increase you in goodness], [so whoever wants to visit, let him visit, and do not say *hujr* (bad words)]) (1).

An-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in (Al-Majmu') (5/ 310): 'Al-Hujr: False speech. The prohibition was initially due to their proximity to the Time of Ignorance (Jahiliyyah), so they might have spoken with the false speech of Jahiliyyah. When the foundations of Islam were established, its rulings paved, and its signs became famous, visiting was permitted for them, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) took precaution by saying: (and do not say *hujr*).' I say: It is not hidden that what the common people and others do during visitation, such as supplicating to the dead, seeking aid from him, and asking Allah by his right, is of the greatest *Hujr* and false speech. So it is upon the scholars to explain to them Allah's ruling on that, and make them understand the prescribed visitation and its purpose. As-San'ani said in (Subul as-Salam) (2/ 162) following hadiths on visitation and its wisdom: (All of it indicates the legitimacy of visiting graves and explains the wisdom in it, and that it is for admonition... so if it is devoid of this, it is not intended by the Shariah).

In the chapter, there is a narration from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, which will come later. 119 - Women are like men in the recommendation of visiting graves, for several reasons: First: The generality of his saying (peace be upon him) (...so visit graves), which includes women. The explanation: The Prophet (peace be upon him), when he forbade visiting graves in the beginning, there is no doubt that the prohibition included both men and women. When he said (I used to forbid you from visiting graves), it was understood that he meant both genders, necessarily, as he was informing them about the prohibition that existed in the beginning for both genders. If this is the case, it is necessary that the address in the second sentence of the hadith, which is his saying: (so visit them), was intended for both genders as well. This is supported by the fact that the address in the rest of the actions mentioned in Muslim's addition in the hadith of Buraydah mentioned previously: (And I forbade you from the meat of sacrificial animals beyond three days, so keep what seems good to you; and I forbade you from Nabidh except in a waterskin, so drink from all containers but do not drink an intoxicant). I say: The address in all these actions is directed to both genders definitively, as is the case in the first address: (I used to forbid you). If it were said that the address in his saying (so visit them) is specific to men, the structure of the speech would be disturbed and its freshness lost, a matter that does not befit the one who was given the comprehensive words, and the one who is the most eloquent to speak the letter *Dad*, peace be upon him. This is further supported by the following points: Second: Their sharing with men in the cause for which visiting graves was prescribed: (For they soften the heart, bring tears to the eye, and remind of the Hereafter). Third: That the Prophet (peace be upon him) permitted them to visit graves in two hadiths preserved for us by the Mother of the Believers Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her:",

[He said]: Yes. He said: For Gabriel came to me when you saw, and he called me - hiding it from you, and I answered him - hiding it from you. He would not enter upon you while you had put aside your clothes, and I thought that you had fallen asleep, so I disliked waking you, and I feared you would be lonely.

    "foot_note": "1. = Abi Shaybah in (Al-Musannaf) (4/ 140), and Al-Haythami added it in (Al-Majmu') saying (3/ 60): (Narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Kabir and its men are men of the Sahih). He erred in the addition regarding At-Tirmidhi narrating it. Its men are the men of the two Sheikhs, but Ibn Jurayj is a *mudallis* (one who conceals sources) and he used 'an' (from). This is the flaw of the hadith. Despite that, Ibn al-Qayyim claimed (4/ 349) that it is (preserved despite what is in it). Thus he said, but rather it is denounced (Munkar) for what we mentioned and because it contradicts the narration of Yazid bin Humayd, who is trustworthy and firm, from Ibn Abi Mulaykah. The contradiction is apparent from her saying (Had I witnessed you, I would not have visited you), for it is explicit that the reason for the visit was only her absence from his death; so had she witnessed it, she would not have visited. Whereas the hadith of Ibn Humayd is explicit that she visited because the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered visiting graves. So his hadith is the preserved one, contrary to what Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, adopted. As for what he mentioned about Aisha's interpretation, it is possible, but the other possibility—that she visited based on an instruction from him (peace be upon him)—is stronger due to the testimony of her following hadith.\n1. Without the transitive 'ba', meaning I wore my izar, so it is transitive by itself.\n2. It is permissible in (A'ish) to use a fatha on the Shin or a damma; both are valid aspects in all truncated vocatives (Murakkhamat).\n3. With a fatha on the unpointed letter and sukun on the pointed one. It means the breathlessness (hasha) befell you, which is the asthma and agitation that happens to one speeding in his walk due to the rising and frequency of breath.

    "foot_note": "1. (1) Al-Hafiz used this hadith as evidence in (At-Talkhis) (5/ 248) for the permissibility of visiting for women, and it is apparent in its indication of that. It supports that the permission included them along with men, because this story happened in Medina, as it is known that the Prophet (peace be upon him) consummated the marriage with Aisha in Medina, and the prohibition was only in the beginning in Mecca. We are certain of this even if we do not know a history that supports it, because correct deduction testifies to it, from his saying (peace be upon him): (I used to forbid you). For it is inconceivable regarding such a prohibition that it would be legislated in the Medinan period, excluding the Meccan period where most legislated rulings related to Tawhid and Creed. The prohibition of visiting is of this type because it is blocking the means (Sadd al-Dhara'i), and its legislation suits the Meccan period because people were new to Islam and their era of Shirk was recent. So he (peace be upon him) forbade them from visiting so it would not be a means to Shirk. Until Tawhid settled in their hearts and they knew what contradicts it of types of Shirk, he permitted them to visit. As for leaving them throughout the Meccan period with their habit of visiting, then forbidding them from it in Medina, it is very far from the wisdom of legislation. Therefore, we asserted that the prohibition was legislated in Mecca. If this is so, his permission to Aisha to visit in Medina is clear evidence for what we mentioned. Ponder this, for it is something that sparked in my mind, and I have not seen anyone who explained it in this way. If I am correct, it is from Allah, and if I erred, it is from myself. As for the deduction of the author of the treatise (Wasiyyah Shar'iyyah) regarding this with his saying (p. 26): (And the Messenger (peace be upon him) approved his daughter Fatima, may Allah be pleased with her, visiting the grave of her uncle Hamza, may Allah be pleased with him), it is a false deduction, because the mentioned approval has no basis in any of the books of Sunnah, and I think it is merely a delusion of the author. What is narrated from her, may Allah be pleased with her, is only visiting; there is no mention of the alleged approval at all. Furthermore, that is not proven from her, for it is from the narration of Sulayman bin Dawood from Ja'far bin Muhammad from his father from Ali bin Al-Hussein from his father that Fatima the daughter of the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to visit the grave of her uncle Hamza every Friday, pray, and weep there. Thus narrated by Al-Hakim (1/ 377) and via his path Al-Bayhaqi (4/ 78) and he said: (Thus he said. It has been said from Sulayman bin Dawood from his father from Ja'far bin Muhammad from his father without mentioning Ali bin Al-Hussein from his father in it, so it is disconnected). Al-Hakim said: (Its narrators to the last of them are trustworthy)! Adh-Dhahabi refuted him saying: (I say: This is very weak/denounced (Munkar), and Sulayman is weak). I say: And I think he is Sulayman bin Dawood bin Qays Al-Farra' Al-Madani. Abu Hatim said (An elder, I do not understand him only as he should be). Al-Azdi said: (He was spoken against). For this reason, Adh-Dhahabi listed him in (Ad-Du'afa) and quoted Al-Azdi's statement mentioned. So do not be deceived =",

Narrated by Al-Bukhari and others, and it has passed in full in Issue (19) (p. 22). He titled it (Chapter: Visiting Graves). Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Fath): (The point of evidence from it is that he (peace be upon him) did not rebuke the woman for sitting at the grave, and his tacit approval is a proof). Al-Ayni said in (Al-Umdah) (3/ 76): (In it is the permissibility of visiting graves absolutely, whether the visitor is a man or a woman, and whether the visited is a Muslim or a disbeliever, due to the lack of separation in that). Al-Hafiz also mentioned something similar at the end of his discussion on the hadith, saying after his phrase (due to lack of seeking detail in that): (An-Nawawi said: The majority definitively stated permissibility. The author of Al-Hawi said: Visiting the grave of a disbeliever is not permissible, which is a mistake (1). End quote). What the hadith indicates regarding the permissibility of women visiting is what comes to mind from the hadith, but this is only valid if the story did not happen before the prohibition. This is the apparent case, if we remember what we mentioned previously that the prohibition was in Mecca, and the story was narrated by Anas who is Medinan; his mother Umm Sulaym brought him to the Prophet (peace be upon him) when he arrived in Medina, and Anas was ten years old. So the story is Medinan, establishing it was after the prohibition, so the deduction for permissibility stands. As for Ibn al-Qayyim's statement in (Tahdhib as-Sunan) (4/ 350):",

    "text": "(And fearing Allah implies doing what He commanded and leaving what He forbade, and among that is the prohibition of visiting). This would be correct if the woman had knowledge of the prohibition of women visiting and that it continued and was not abrogated. Then his saying: (And among that is the prohibition of visiting) would be established. But since this is unknown to us, it is an incorrect deduction. It is supported by the fact that if the prohibition were still continuing, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would have forbidden her from visiting explicitly and explained that to her, and would not have sufficed with ordering her to fear Allah in a general manner. This is apparent, if Allah the Exalted wills. 120 - However, it is not permissible for them to visit graves frequently and go back and forth to them, because that may lead them to contradict the Shari'ah, such as wailing, displaying adornment (Tabarruj), taking graves as places for picnics, and wasting time in idle talk, as is witnessed today in some Islamic lands. This is the intended meaning - God willing - of the famous hadith: (The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) cursed (and in a wording: Allah cursed) the women who frequently visit graves [*zawwarat*]). It has been narrated from a group of Companions: Abu Hurayrah, Hassan bin Thabit, and Abdullah bin Abbas. 1 - As for the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, it is from the path of Umar bin Abi Salamah from his father from him. Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2/ 156 - Tuhfah), Ibn Majah (1/ 478), Ibn Hibban (789), Al-Bayhaqi (4/ 78), At-Tayalisi (1/ 171 - his arrangement), and Ahmad (2/ 337). The other wording belongs to At-Tayalisi and Al-Bayhaqi. At-Tirmidhi said: (A good authentic [Hasan Sahih] hadith. Some people of knowledge viewed that this was before the Prophet permitted visiting graves. When he permitted it, men and women entered into his permission. Others said: He only disliked visiting graves for women due to their lack of patience and excessive anxiety). I say: The men of the hadith's chain are all trustworthy, except that there is some talk about Umar bin Abi Salamah. Perhaps his hadith does not drop below the rank of Hasan, but this hadith of his is authentic due to the witnesses that follow. 2 - As for the hadith of Hassan bin Thabit, it is from the path of Abdul Rahman bin Bahman from Abdul Rahman bin Thabit from his father with it.",

Al-Busiri said in (Az-Zawa'id) (Folio 98/ 2): (Its chain is authentic, its men are trustworthy). Thus he said, but this Ibn Bahman was not authenticated by anyone except Ibn Hibban and Al-Ijli, and they are known for leniency in authentication. Ibn Al-Madini said about him: (We do not know him). Therefore, Al-Hafiz said in (At-Taqrib): (Acceptable), meaning when corroborated. I did not find a corroborator for him, but the witness before it and after it acts as corroboration, so the hadith is acceptable. 3 - As for the hadith of Ibn Abbas, it is from the path of Abu Salih from him with the first wording except that he said: (female visitors [*za'irat*] of graves) and in a narration (frequent visitors [*zawwarat*]). Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (4/ 140), the authors of the four Sunan, Ibn Hibban (788), Al-Hakim, Al-Bayhaqi, At-Tayalisi - and the other narration belongs to the latter two - and Ahmad (No. 2030, 2603, 2986, 3118).

I have listed his hadith in (Silsilat Al-Ahadith Ad-Da'ifah) due to an addition he was unique in. I mentioned some statements of the Imams regarding his status, so refer to (223). It has become clear from the extraction of the hadith that the preserved wording in it is (Zawwarat) [frequent visitors] due to the agreement of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and Hassan on it, as well as the hadith of Ibn Abbas in the narration of the majority, despite its weakness. If it is not suitable for evidence alone, it does not harm, as the other narration from the hadith of Ibn Abbas does not harm the mentioned agreement, as is apparent. If the matter is so, then this wording (Zawwarat) only indicates cursing women who visit frequently. Unlike others, the curse does not include them. Therefore, it is not permissible to oppose the previously mentioned hadiths indicating the recommendation of visiting for women with this hadith, because it is specific and those are general. So both are applied in their places. This reconciliation is better than the claim of abrogation. A group of scholars held the view similar to what we mentioned. Al-Qurtubi said:",

Al-Shawkani said in (Nayl al-Awtar) (4/ 95): (This speech is what should be relied upon in reconciling the hadiths of the chapter that contradict in appearance) (1). 121 - And it is permissible to visit the grave of one who died upon other than Islam for admonition only. Regarding this, there are two hadiths: First: On the authority of Abu Hurayrah who said: (The Prophet (peace be upon him) visited his mother's grave. He wept and made those around him weep. He said: I asked my Lord for permission to ask forgiveness for her, but I was not granted permission. And I asked Him for permission to visit her grave, and He granted me permission. So visit graves, for they remind of death).",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) As-San'ani also went to this reconciliation in (Subul as-Salam), but he used evidence for permissibility that is questionable, so I liked to point it out. First: The hadith of Al-Hussein bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them both (That Fatima the daughter of the Prophet, peace be upon him, used to visit the grave of her uncle Hamza every Friday, pray, and weep). Narrated by Al-Hakim (1/ 377) and from him Al-Bayhaqi (4/ 78) stating (It is disconnected). Al-Hafiz remained silent about it in (At-Talkhis) (5/ 248) and As-San'ani followed him! The silence of these two and Al-Bayhaqi limiting the flaw to disconnection might create the illusion that it is free from other flaws. It is not so, as previously explained shortly before. Second: The hadith of Al-Bayhaqi in (Shu'ab al-Iman) as Mursal: (Whoever visits the grave of his parents or one of them every Friday, he is forgiven and written as righteous). As-San'ani also remained silent about it. It is very weak, rather it is fabricated. It is not just Mursal as As-San'ani mentioned, but it is problematic (Mu'dal) because the one who raised it is Muhammad bin An-Nu'man, who is not a Tabi'i. Al-Iraqi said in (Takhrij Al-Ihya) (4/ 418): (Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya narrated it in [Al-Qubur] and it is Mu'dal; Muhammad bin An-Nu'man is unknown). I say: He received it from Yahya bin Al-Ala Al-Bajali with his chain from Abu Hurayrah. At-Tabarani narrated it in Al-Saghir (199). Waki' and Ahmad called Yahya a liar.

Also from Ibn Abbas, which contains weakness as will be pointed out at the end of the issue after the next one. And from Umar and others, and they contain weakness as explained by Al-Hafiz Al-Haythami in (Al-Majmu') (3/ 60). 122 - As for reading the Qur'an when visiting them, it has no basis in the Sunnah. Rather, the hadiths mentioned in the previous issue imply its lack of legislation. For if it were prescribed, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would have done it and taught it to his Companions, especially since Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, who was among the most beloved people to him (peace be upon him), asked him what to say if she visited graves? So he taught her the Greeting (Salam) and Supplication. He did not teach her to read Al-Fatiha or anything else from the Qur'an. If reading were prescribed, he would not have concealed that from her. How could he, when delaying clarification beyond the time of need is not permissible as established in the science of Usul, so what about concealment? And had he (peace be upon him) taught them anything of that, it would have been transmitted to us. Since it has not been transmitted with an established chain, it indicates that it did not happen. What strengthens the lack of legislation is his saying (peace be upon him): (Do not make your houses graveyards, for Satan flees from the house in which Surah Al-Baqarah is read). Narrated by Muslim (2/ 188), At-Tirmidhi (4/ 42) - and he authenticated it - and Ahmad (2/ 284, 337, 378, 388) from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. It has a witness from the hadith of Salsal bin Ad-Dalhams. Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi in (Ash-Shu'ab) as in (Al-Jami' as-Saghir). The Prophet (peace be upon him) indicated that graves are not a place for reading according to Shari'ah. Therefore, he encouraged reading the Qur'an in houses and forbade making them like graveyards where reading is not done, just as he indicated in the other hadith that they are not a place for prayer either, which is his saying: (Pray in your houses, and do not take them as graves). Narrated by Muslim (2/ 187) and others from Ibn Umar. It is in Al-Bukhari with a similar wording, and he titled it: (Chapter: Dislike of Prayer in Graveyards), indicating that Ibn Umar's hadith implies the dislike of...",

    "text": "prayer in graveyards, so likewise the hadith of Abu Hurayrah implies the dislike of reading the Qur'an in graveyards, and there is no difference (1). For that reason, the school of the majority of the Salaf like Abu Hanifa, Malik, and others (2) was the dislike of reading at graves. It is the opinion of Imam Ahmad. Abu Dawood said in his Masa'il (p. 158):",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) A group of scholars used the hadith as evidence for what Al-Bukhari used it for, and Al-Hafiz supported him in his explanation. I have mentioned his words in the following issue (No. 128, paragraph 7).\n2. Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned it from them in (Iqtida' as-Sirat al-Mustaqim Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim) (p. 128) and said: (No speech is preserved from Ash-Shafi'i himself on this issue, because that was an innovation to him. Malik said: I have not known anyone doing that, so it is known that the Companions and the Tabi'un did not do it). He said in (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Ilmiyyah) (p. 53): (And reading over the dead after his death is an innovation (Bid'ah), unlike reading over the dying person, for it is recommended to read Ya-Sin). I say: But the hadith of reading Ya-Sin is weak as presented (p. 11), and recommendation is a legal ruling, and it is not established by a weak hadith as is known from Ibn Taymiyyah's own words in some of his works and others. As for what came in (Kitab ar-Ruh) by Ibn al-Qayyim (p. 13): Al-Khallal said: Al-Hasan bin Ahmad Al-Warraq informed me: Ali bin Musa Al-Haddad - and he was truthful - told us: I was with Ahmad bin Hanbal and Muhammad bin Qudamah Al-Jawhari in a funeral. When the dead was buried, a blind man sat reading at the grave. Ahmad said to him: O you, reading at the grave is a Bid'ah! When we left the graveyard, Muhammad bin Qudamah said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: O Abu Abdullah, what do you say about Mubashir Al-Halabi? He said: Trustworthy. He said: Did you write anything from him? He said: Yes. He said: Mubashir informed me from Abdul Rahman bin Al-Ala bin Al-Lajlaj (Original: Al-Hallaj, which is a mistake) from his father that he requested that when he is buried, the opening of Al-Baqarah and its end be read at his head, and he said: I heard Ibn Umar recommending that. Ahmad said to him: Go back and tell the man to read). The answer to it is from several aspects: First: There is doubt about the authenticity of this story from Ahmad, because Al-Khallal's sheikh, Al-Hasan bin Ahmad Al-Warraq, I did not find a biography for him in the books of narrators I have now. Similarly, his sheikh Ali bin Musa Al-Haddad, I did not know him. Even if it is said in this chain that he was truthful, the apparent meaning is that the speaker is this Al-Warraq, and you have known his condition. Second: If it is proven from him, it is more specific than what Abu Dawood narrated from him, and the result of reconciling the two narrations from him is that his school is the dislike of reading at the grave except at burial. Third: The chain of this report is not authentic from Ibn Umar, even if we assume it is proven from Ahmad, because Abdul Rahman bin Al-Ala bin Al-Lajlaj is counted among the unknown narrators, as indicated by Adh-Dhahabi's statement in his biography in (Al-Mizan): (Nothing was narrated from him except by this Mubashir). Ibn As-Asakir narrated it from his path (13/ 399 / 2). As for Ibn Hibban's authentication of him, it is not relied upon due to his fame for leniency in authentication. Therefore, Al-Hafiz did not rely on it in (At-Taqrib) when he said about the subject: (Acceptable), meaning when corroborated, otherwise the hadith is soft as he stated in the introduction. What supports what we mentioned is that At-Tirmidhi, despite his leniency in authentication, when he narrated another hadith for him (2/ 128) and he has no other with him, remained silent about it and did not authenticate it! =",

    "foot_note": "1. = Fourth: That even if its chain were proven from Ibn Umar, it is halted (Mawquf) and he did not raise it to the Prophet (peace be upon him), so there is no proof in it at all. Like this report is what Ibn al-Qayyim also mentioned (p. 14): (And Al-Khallal mentioned from Ash-Sha'bi who said: The Ansar, if a dead person died among them, used to go to his grave to read the Qur'an). We are in doubt about the authenticity of that from Ash-Sha'bi with this specific wording. I saw Al-Suyuti cited it in (Sharh as-Sudur) (p. 15) with the wording: (The Ansar used to read Surah Al-Baqarah at the dead person). He said: (Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah and Al-Marwazi). He included it in (Chapter: What a person says during final illness, and what is read at him). Then I saw it in (Al-Musannaf) by Ibn Abi Shaybah (4/ 74) and he titled it: (Chapter: What is said at the sick person when he is dying). It became clear that its chain contains Mujalid, who is Ibn Sa'id. Al-Hafiz said in (At-Taqrib): (He is not strong, and he changed in the end of his life). It appeared from this that the report is not about reading at the grave but at the time of dying, and even then, it has a weak chain. As for the hadith (Whoever passes by graveyards and reads [Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad] eleven times then gifts its reward to the dead, he is given reward according to the number of the dead). It is a false, fabricated hadith. Narrated by Abu Muhammad Al-Khallal in (Reading at Graves) (Folio 201/ 2) and Ad-Daylami from the copy of Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Amir from his father from Ali Ar-Rida from his fathers. It is a fabricated, false copy that is not free from the fabrication of this Abdullah or his father, as Adh-Dhahabi said in (Al-Mizan) and Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar followed him in (Al-Lisan), then Al-Suyuti in (Dhayl al-Ahadith al-Mawdu'ah), and he mentioned this hadith for him, and Ibn Iraq followed him in (Tanzih ash-Shari'ah al-Marfu'ah 'an al-Ahadith ash-Shi'ah al-Mawdu'ah). Then Al-Suyuti overlooked that, so he cited the hadith in (Sharh as-Sudur) (p. 130) with the narration of Abu Muhammad As-Samarqandi in (Virtues of Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad) and remained silent about it! Yes, he indicated its weakness before that, but this is not enough because the hadith is fabricated by his admission, so it is not permissible to limit it to weakening, nor is it permissible to remain silent about it, as Sheikh Ismail Al-Ajluni did in (Kashf al-Khafa') (2 - 382) for he attributed it to Ar-Rafi'i in his history and remained silent about it! Even though he wrote his book as a reminder to uncover (what is famous of hadiths on people's tongues)! Moreover, the silence of specialists regarding a hadith may give the illusion to those with no knowledge that the hadith is suitable for argumentation or acting upon in virtuous deeds as they say. This is what happened to this hadith, for I saw some Hanafis arguing with this hadith for reading at graves, namely Sheikh At-Tahtawi on (Maraqi al-Falah) (p. 117)! He attributed this to Ad-Daraqutni, and I think it is a delusion. I did not find anyone else attributing it to him. Furthermore, it is known among those busy with this science that attribution to Ad-Daraqutni absolutely implies his book (As-Sunan), and I did not see this hadith in it. And Allah knows best.",

When I woke up, I asked him. I said: O Messenger of Allah, where did you go tonight? He said: I was sent to the people of Al-Baqi' to pray for them). Narrated by Ahmad (6/ 92), and it is in (Al-Muwatta') (1/ 239 - 240). An-Nasa'i narrated from him (1/ 287) similarly, but it does not mention raising the hands, and its chain is good (Hasan). Raising hands was proven in another story of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, which proceeded in Issue (119). 124 - However, he does not face the graves when supplicating for them, but rather the Kaaba, due to his (peace be upon him) prohibition of praying towards graves as will come. And supplication is the marrow of prayer and its core as is known, so it has its ruling. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: (Supplication is worship, then he recited {And your Lord said, \"Call upon Me; I will respond to you\"}). Narrated by Ibn Al-Mubarak in (Az-Zuhd) (10/ 151), Al-Bukhari in (Al-Adab Al-Mufrad) No. (714), Abu Dawood (1/ 551 - with 'Awn explanation), At-Tirmidhi (4/ 178, 223), Ibn Majah (2/ 428 - 429), Ibn Hibban (2396), Al-Hakim (1/ 491), Ibn Mandah in (At-Tawhid) (Folio 69/ 1), and Ahmad (4/ 167, 271, 276, 277). Al-Hakim said: (Authentic chain) and Adh-Dhahabi agreed, and it is as they said. At-Tirmidhi said: (A good authentic [Hasan Sahih] hadith). Abu Ya'la narrated it from the hadith of Al-Bara' bin Azib as in (Al-Jami' as-Saghir). In the chapter, there is a narration from Anas bin Malik raised (Marfu') with the wording: (Supplication is the marrow of worship). Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2234) and he said: (A strange [Gharib] hadith from this face; we do not know it except from the hadith of Ibn Lahi'ah). I say: He is weak due to his poor memory, so he is used for corroboration unless it is from the narration of one of the 'Abadilah",

    "text": "from him, so it is used as evidence then. This is not one of them, but its meaning is correct due to the hadith of An-Nu'man. Al-Tibi said in his explanation: (He used the pronoun of separation and the predicate defined by 'Al' [is the worship] to indicate restriction/exclusivity, and that worship is nothing other than supplication. Others said: The meaning is that it is the greatest of worship, so it is like the report (Hajj is Arafah) meaning its greatest pillar. This is because it indicates that the doer turns his face to Allah, turning away from everything else, because he is commanded to do so, and doing the commanded act is worship. He called it worship to humble the supplicant and show his humiliation, destitution, and poverty, for worship is humiliation, submission, and poverty). Mentioned by Al-Munawi in (Al-Fayd). I say: If supplication is among the greatest of worship, how can one turn in it to other than the direction commanded to face in prayer? Therefore, it is established among the investigative scholars that (One does not face in supplication except what is faced in prayer). Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, said in (Iqtida' as-Sirat al-Mustaqim Mukhalafat Ashab al-Jahim) (p. 175): (This is a continuous principle that it is not recommended for the supplicant to face except what is recommended to pray towards. Do you not see that when a man was forbidden from praying towards the East and other directions, he is forbidden from seeking to face them at the time of supplication. Some people seek to face the direction where a righteous man is at the time of their supplication, whether it is in the East or elsewhere. This is manifest error and clear evil. Just as some people refrain from turning their backs to the direction where some righteous people are, while they turn their backs to the direction where the House of Allah is! And the grave of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)! All these things are innovations that resemble the religion of the Christians). He mentioned lines before that from Imam Ahmad and the companions of Malik that the prescribed action is facing the Qiblah in supplication even at the grave of the Prophet (peace be upon him) after greeting him. It is the school of the Shafi'is as well. Al-Nawawi said in (Al-Majmu') (5/ 311): Imam Abu Al-Hasan Muhammad bin Marzuq Az-Za'farani - who was among the investigative jurists - said in his book on (Funerals): (One does not touch the grave with his hand, nor kiss it). He said: (And upon this the Sunnah passed). He said: (Touching graves and kissing them, which the common people do now, are among the repugnant innovations",

He said: (Whoever intends to greet a dead person greets him facing his face, and if he wants to supplicate, he turns from his place and faces the Qiblah). It is the school of Abu Hanifa as well. Sheikh al-Islam said in (Al-Qa'idah Al-Jalilah fi At-Tawassul wal-Wasilah) (p. 125): (The school of the four Imams: Malik, Abu Hanifa, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and others from the Imams of Islam is that if a man greets the Prophet (peace be upon him) and wants to pray for himself, he faces the Qiblah. They differed regarding the time of greeting him. The three - Malik, Ash-Shafi'i, and Ahmad - said: He faces the Chamber and greets him facing his face. Abu Hanifa said: He does not face the Chamber at the time of greeting, just as he does not face it at the time of supplication by their agreement. Then within his school there are two opinions: It is said: He turns his back to the Chamber. And it is said: He puts it on his left. This is their dispute regarding the time of greeting. As for the time of supplication, they did not dispute that he only faces the Qiblah, not the Chamber). The reason for the mentioned difference is simply that the Honored Chamber, being outside the Mosque, and the Companions used to greet him, it was not possible for anyone to face his face (peace be upon him) and turn his back to the Qiblah (1), as became possible after its inclusion into the Mosque after the Companions. So if a Muslim among them faced the Qiblah, the Chamber would be on his left. If they faced the Chamber, the Qiblah would be on their right and the direction of the West behind them. Sheikh al-Islam said in (Al-Jawab Al-Bahir) (p. 14) after mentioning this meaning: So then if they were facing him and turning their backs to the West, the opinion of the majority is more likely. If they were facing the Qiblah then and putting the Chamber on their left, the opinion of Abu Hanifa is more likely). I say: The Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, left the issue suspended, so he did not decide whether they used to face it or face the grave, as if due to the lack of a proven narration from them on that. But if we assume they were facing him, you have known that in this case they would be turning their backs to the West, not the Qiblah,",

It proceeded that the majority say one should face his face (peace be upon him) also when greeting him, and this necessitates turning one's back to the Qiblah. A matter we are certain did not happen in the time of the Companions as preceded. This is an additional matter to facing the Chamber, and it must have evidence to prove it. Does it have existence? That is something I do not know, nor have I seen anyone from the scholars address this, whether specifically for the grave of the Messenger (peace be upon him) or graves in general. Yes, some of them used the hadith of Ibn Abbas as evidence: (The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed by the graves of Medina, so he turned his face towards them and said: Peace be upon you, O people of the graves! May Allah forgive us and you; you are our predecessors and we are on the trail). Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2/ 156) and Ad-Diya in (Al-Mukhtarah) (58/ 192 / 1) via the path of At-Tabarani. At-Tirmidhi said: (Hasan Gharib). I say: In its chain is Qabus bin Abi Zabyan. An-Nasa'i said: (He is not strong). Ibn Hibban said: (Bad memory, he narrates uniquely from his father things that have no basis). I say: And this is from his narration from his father, so it is not used as proof. Perhaps At-Tirmidhi's grading of his hadith as Hasan is only in consideration of its witnesses, for its meaning is established in authentic hadiths, and a good portion of them has passed recently. Except that his saying: (so he turned his face towards them) is denounced (Munkar) due to this weak narrator being unique in it. If you know this, Sheikh Ali Al-Qari said in (Mirqat al-Mafatih) (2/ 407): (In it is evidence that it is recommended during the greeting of the dead that one's face be towards the face of the dead, and to continue like that in supplication as well. This is the practice of the general Muslims, contrary to what Ibn Hajar said that the Sunnah according to us is that in the state of supplication one faces the Qiblah as known from other hadiths regarding supplication in general). I say: In this deduction is an apparent flaw, since there is nothing in the hadith except his (peace be upon him) turning his face to the graves. As for turning to the faces of the dead, that is another thing which needs another text",

The truth is that if the chain of the hadith were proven, it would be clear evidence that the passerby at graves faces them with his face when greeting and praying for them, however the facing may be, and as it happens without intending the faces of the dead. But since the chain is weak as previously explained, it is not suitable for evidence at all. Nor does what was mentioned previously from Imam Malik about the lack of legitimacy of facing the Chamber during supplication contradict the story in which it is said that Malik, when Al-Mansur Al-Abbasi asked him about facing the Chamber, ordered him to do so and said: It is your means (wasilah) and the means of your father Adam. Because it is a false story, fabricated against Malik, and has no known chain. Moreover, it contradicts what is proven and transmitted from him with chains of trustworthy narrators in the books of his companions, as Ismail mentioned in (Ishaaq Al-Qadi) and others. Similar to it is what they mentioned about him being asked about people who prolong standing facing the Chamber praying for themselves, so Malik denied that and mentioned that it is among the innovations that the Companions and the Tabi'un did not do with excellence, and he said (Nothing will rectify the end of this nation except what rectified its beginning) (1). 125 - And if he visits the grave of a disbeliever, he does not greet him, nor pray for him, but rather gives him tidings of the Fire. Likewise, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) commanded in the hadith of Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas who said: (A Bedouin came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: My father used to maintain ties of kinship, and was such and such, so where is he? He said: In the Fire. It was as if the Bedouin found that difficult. He said: O Messenger of Allah! Then where is your father? He said: (Wherever you pass by the grave of a disbeliever, give him tidings of the Fire). He said: So the Bedouin became Muslim afterwards and said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) tasked me with a burden! I never passed by a grave of a disbeliever except that I gave him tidings of the Fire). Narrated by At-Tabarani in (Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir) (1/ 191 / 1) and Ibn As-Sunni in (Amal al-Yawm wa al-Laylah)",

As for Al-Khattabi's saying: It seems the prohibition regarding them is due to the pride in them, it is critiqued by the fact that Ibn Umar used to wear Sibtite sandals and say: The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to wear them. And it is an authentic hadith. At-Tahawi said: (The prohibition of the mentioned man is interpreted as his sandals having filth, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to pray in his sandals as long as he did not see harm in them). I say: This possibility is far-fetched; rather Ibn Hazm asserted (5/ 137) its invalidity, and that it is speaking about Allah without knowledge! The closer view is that the prohibition is out of respect for the dead, so it is like the prohibition of sitting on the grave coming in Issue (128, paragraph 6). Based on this, there is no difference between Sibtite sandals and other sandals that have hair, as all are in the same position regarding walking in them between graves and contradicting the respect for them. Ibn al-Qayyim explained that in (Tahdhib as-Sunan) (4/ 343 - 345) and quoted from Imam Ahmad that he said: (The hadith of Bashir has a good chain, I adopt it except due to a defect). It is proven that Imam Ahmad used to act upon this hadith. Abu Dawood said in his Masa'il (p. 158): (I saw Ahmad, when he followed a funeral and got close to the graveyards, take off his sandals). May Allah have mercy on him, how much he followed the Sunnah.\n1. What we mentioned does not contradict the hadith of Ibn Abbas regarding the Prophet (peace be upon him) placing two halves of a palm branch on the two graves and saying: (Perhaps it will be lightened for them as long as they do not dry). Agreed upon, and I extracted it in (Sahih Abi Dawood) (15). Because it is specific to him (peace be upon him) evidenced by the fact that the Salaf did not act upon it, and for other reasons to be explained. Al-Khattabi, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, said in (Ma'alim as-Sunan) (1/ 27) commenting on the hadith: (It is seeking blessings through the trace of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his supplication for lightening for them. It is as if he made the duration of the moisture remaining in them a limit for what the request for lightening the punishment for them occurred, and that is not because the wet palm branch has a meaning not found in the dry one. The common people in many lands plant palm branches on the graves of their dead, and I see they went to this opinion. But there is no validity for what they undertook of that). Sheikh Ahmad Shakir said in his commentary on At-Tirmidhi (1/ 103) following this: (And Al-Khattabi spoke the truth. The common people have increased in persistence on this action which has no basis, and went to extremes in it, especially in the lands of Egypt, imitating the Christians, until they started putting flowers on graves and gifting them among themselves, so people put them on the graves of their relatives and acquaintances as a greeting to them and courtesy to the living. It even became a custom similar to official protocol in international courtesies, so you find the great ones among Muslims, if they visit a town in Europe, they go to the graves of its greats or to the grave of the one they call (The Soldier =",

The scholars who resemble the common people do not deny that; rather, you see them doing it themselves at the graves of their dead. I have learned that most endowments called charitable endowments have their proceeds dedicated to palm branches and basil placed on graves. All these are innovations and forbidden acts that have no basis in the religion, and no support from the Book and Sunnah. It is obligatory upon the people of knowledge to deny them and invalidate these customs as much as they can)... I say: Supporting the fact that placing the palm branch on the grave is specific to him, and that the lightening was not due to the moisture of its split part, are several matters: A - The long hadith of Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him, in (Sahih Muslim) (8/ 231 - 236), in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: (I passed by two graves being punished, so I liked that by my intercession it be withheld from them as long as the two branches are moist). This is explicit that lifting the punishment is only due to his (peace be upon him) intercession and supplication, not due to the moisture. Whether this story of Jabir is the same as the story of Ibn Abbas mentioned previously as Al-Ayni and others preferred, or different as Al-Hafiz preferred in (Al-Fath). On the first probability, it is clear. On the other probability, correct observation requires that the cause be one in both stories due to the similarity between them, and because moisture being a cause for lightening punishment for the dead is not known legally or rationally. If the matter were so, the lightest people in punishment would be the disbelievers who are buried in cemeteries resembling gardens due to the abundance of plants and trees planted there that remain green summer and winter! Added to the above is that some scholars like Al-Suyuti mentioned that the reason for the effect of moisture in lightening is that it praises Allah Almighty. They said: So if it goes from the wood and it dries, its praising is cut off! This reasoning contradicts the generality of His Blessed and Exalted saying: (And there is not a thing except that it exalts [Allah] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting). B - In the hadith of Ibn Abbas itself, there is an indication that the secret is not in the moisture, or rather it is not the cause for lightening the punishment. That is his saying (then he called for a palm branch and split it in two), meaning lengthwise. It is known that splitting it causes the moisture to leave the split part and dry quickly, so the duration of lightening would be less than if he did not split it. If it were the cause, he (peace be upon him) would have kept it without splitting and placed a branch or at least half of it on every grave. Since he did not do so, it indicates that moisture is not the cause, and it is determined that it is a sign for the duration of lightening which Allah permitted in response to the intercession of His Prophet (peace be upon him), as explicitly stated in Jabir's hadith. Thus the two hadiths agree on identifying the cause, even if they might differ in the incident and its multiplicity. Ponder this, for it is something that sparked in my mind, and I did not find anyone who stated it or pointed to it among the scholars. If it is correct, it is from Allah Almighty, and if it is incorrect, it is from me, and I seek His forgiveness for everything that does not please Him. C - If moisture were intended in itself, the Salaf as-Salih would have understood that and acted according to it, and they would have placed palm branches and myrtle and the like on graves when visiting them. Had they done so, it would have been famous from them, then trustworthy narrators would have transmitted it to us, because it is of the matters that draw attention and motives call for its transmission. Since it was not transmitted, it indicates it did not happen, and that drawing near to Allah with it is an innovation. So the intended meaning is established. =",

He said: And this hadith is a basis for planting trees at graves)! I say: It is said to him: (Establish the Throne then engrave), and (Can the shadow be straight while the stick is crooked)? If the analogy were correct, the Salaf would have rushed to it because they are more eager for good than us. So what preceded indicates that placing the palm branch on the grave is specific to him (peace be upon him), and that the secret in lightening the punishment for the two graves was not in the moisture of the branch but in his (peace be upon him) intercession and supplication for them. This is something that cannot happen again after his (peace be upon him) transition to the Highest Companion, nor for anyone else after him (peace be upon him), because knowing the punishment of the grave is one of his specifics, peace be upon him, and it is of the Unseen that no one views except the Messenger as came in the text of the Qur'an (Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His unseen to anyone / Except whom He has approved of messengers). Know that what Al-Suyuti cited in (Sharh as-Sudur) (131) does not contradict what we explained: (And Ibn As-Asakir extracted via the path of Hammad bin Salamah from Qatadah that Abu Barzah Al-Aslami, may Allah be pleased with him, used to narrate that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed by a grave whose companion was being punished, so he took a palm branch and planted it in the grave, and said: Perhaps it will be relieved for him as long as it is moist. And Abu Barzah used to recommend: If I die, put two palm branches with me in my grave. He said: So he died in a desert between (Kirman) and (Qumis). They said: He used to recommend us to put two branches in his grave and this is a place where we do not find them. While they were like that, a caravan appeared from the direction of (Sijistan), and they found palm fronds with them. So they took two branches and put them with him in his grave. And Ibn Sa'd extracted from Murriq who said: Buraydah recommended that two palm branches be placed in his grave). I say: The reason for lack of contradiction is that there is nothing in these two reports - assuming both are proven - indicating the legitimacy of placing palm branches *when visiting graves*, the innovation of which we claimed due to the Salaf not acting upon it. The most they contain is placing the two branches *with the dead in his grave*, which is another issue, even if it is like the one before it in lack of legislation because the hadith narrated by Abu Barzah, like other Companions, does not indicate that. Especially since the hadith mentions placing one branch, and he recommended placing two branches in his grave. Moreover, the report's chain is not authentic. Al-Khatib narrated it in the History of (Baghdad) (1/ 183 - 182) and via his path Ibn As-Asakir in (Tarikh Dimashq) at the end of the biography of Nadlah bin Ubayd bin Abi Barzah Al-Aslami from Ash-Shah bin Ammar who said: Abu Salih Sulayman bin Salih Al-Laythi told us, he said: An-Nadr bin Al-Mundhir bin Tha'labah Al-Abhadi informed us from Hammad bin Salamah with it. I say: This is a weak chain, and it has two defects: First: The anonymity of Ash-Shah and An-Nadr, for I did not find a biography for them. The other: The 'an'anah (narrating with 'from') of Qatadah, for they did not mention a narration for him from Abu Barzah, and he is mentioned for Tadlis (concealing sources), so his 'an'anah is feared in a chain like this. =",

Narrated by Abu Dawood (2/ 71) and Abdur-Razzaq's statement belongs to him, Al-Bayhaqi (4/ 57), and Ahmad (3/ 197). Its chain is authentic on the condition of the two Sheikhs. (1)",
    "foot_note": "1. = As for the bequest of Buraydah, it is proven from him. Ibn Sa'd said in (At-Tabaqat) (Vol 7 Folio 1 p 4): Affan bin Muslim informed us, he said: Hammad bin Salamah told us, he said: Asim Al-Ahwal informed us, he said: Murriq said: Buraydah Al-Aslami recommended that two palm branches be placed in his grave. It happened that he died at the nearest part of Khurasan, and they were not found except in the saddlebag of a donkey. This is an authentic chain. Al-Bukhari suspended it (3/ 173) firmly. Al-Hafiz said in his explanation: (It was as if Buraydah took the hadith on its generality, and did not see it specific to those two men. Ibn Rushayd said: It appears from Al-Bukhari's conduct that it is specific to them, thus he followed it with Ibn Umar's saying: Only his deeds will shade him). I say: There is no doubt that what Al-Bukhari went to is the correct view due to what preceded of explanation. Buraydah's opinion is no proof, because it is an opinion, and the hadith does not indicate it even if it were general, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not put the branch *in* the grave, but *on* it as preceded. And (The best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad). \n1. Sheikh al-Islam said in (Al-Iqtida') (p. 182): (As for slaughtering there - meaning at graves - it is forbidden absolutely. Our companions and others mentioned it due to this hadith. Ahmad said in the narration of Al-Marwazi -: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: There is no 'Aqr in Islam. They used to, when a dead person died among them, slaughter a camel at his grave, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade that. Abu Abdullah disliked eating its meat. Our companions said: And in the meaning of this is what many people of our time do of giving charity at the grave with bread or similar things). And Al-Nawawi said in (Al-Majmu') (5/ 320): (As for slaughtering and 'Aqr at the grave, it is blameworthy due to this hadith of Anas. Narrated by Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhi and he said: Hasan Sahih). I say: This is if the slaughtering there is for Allah Almighty. But if it is for the owner of the grave as some ignoramuses do, it is explicit Shirk, and eating it is haram (forbidden) and Fisq (immorality) as Allah Almighty said: {And do not eat of that upon which the name of Allah has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience.} [Al-An'am: 121]. Meaning: While the situation is such that it was slaughtered for other than Allah, as this is the meaning of Fisq here as Allah Almighty mentioned in His saying (or ungodly disobedience [fisq], dedicated to other than Allah), as in (Az-Zawajir) (1/ 171) by the jurist Al-Haytami. He said: (Allah cursed (and in a narration: Cursed is) the one who slaughters for other than Allah). Narrated by Ahmad (No. 2817, 2915, 2917) with a good (Hasan) chain from Ibn Abbas, and Muslim (6/ 84) from Ali similarly.",

Al-Mundhiri (4/ 341) and others found fault with it due to disconnection between Sulayman bin Musa and Jabir. But this is regarding the path of Abu Dawood and others; otherwise, Al-Hakim narrated it via the path of Ibn Jurayj from Abu Az-Zubayr from Jabir. This is a chain on the condition of Muslim. Ibn Jurayj explicitly stated hearing it from Abu Az-Zubayr and the latter from Jabir in his narration, so the doubt of their Tadlis (concealing sources) was removed.

Then he used it as evidence that it is recommended not to add to the grave over the earth extracted from it and said: (Ash-Shafi'i said: If he adds, there is no harm. Our companions said: It means it is not disliked). I say: This contradicts the apparent prohibition, for the principle in it is prohibition (Tahrim).

Abu Dawood said in (Al-Masa'il) (p. 158): (I heard Ahmad say: Nothing should be added to the grave from other earth, unless it is to level it with the ground so it is not known. As if he permitted it then). But it was mentioned in (Al-Insaf) (2/ 548) from him that it is only disliked (Karaha)! Imam Muhammad said in (Al-Athar) (p. 45): (Abu Hanifa informed us from Hammad from Ibrahim who said: It used to be said: Raise the grave so it is known as a grave and not stepped on. Muhammad said: And we take this view, and we do not see adding to what came out of it, and we dislike that it be plastered, or mudded, or that a place of prayer (masjid) or a mark be made at it, or that it be written upon. And we dislike baked bricks for building or entering the grave. And we see no harm in sprinkling water on it. This is the saying of Abu Hanifa). I say: The hadith indicates by implication the permissibility of raising the grave as much as the earth extracted from it allows, and that would be about a hand span. It agrees with the text mentioned in Issue (107). As for plastering (Tajsis), it is from (Jiss) which is lime. The meaning is coating with it. It says in (Al-Qamus): (And he Jassasa the vessel: filled it; and the building: coated it with lime). Perhaps the prohibition of plastering is because it is a type of decoration as some early scholars said. Based on this, what is the ruling on mudding (Tat'yin) the grave? The scholars have two opinions: First: Dislike (Karaha). Imam Muhammad explicitly stated it as I quoted from him just now. Dislike according to him implies prohibition (Tahrim) if used absolutely. Abu Hafs from the Hanbalis said it implies dislike as in (Al-Insaf) (2/ 549). The other: That there is no harm in it. Abu Dawood (158) narrated it from Imam Ahmad. It was asserted in (Al-Insaf). At-Tirmidhi (2/ 155) narrated it from Imam Ash-Shafi'i. Al-Nawawi said following it: (The majority of companions did not address it, so the correct view is that there is no dislike in it as explicitly stated, and no prohibition came regarding it). I say: Perhaps the correct view is detailing it as follows: If the intention of mudding is preserving the grave and keeping it raised as much as the Shari'ah permitted, and so winds do not blow it away nor rains scatter it, then it is permissible without doubt because it achieves a legitimate purpose. Perhaps this is the perspective of those Hanbalis who said",

Al-Nawawi said (5/ 298): (Our companions said: Whether the writing on the grave is on a board at its head as is the habit of some people, or elsewhere, all of it is disliked due to the generality of the hadith). Some scholars made an exception for writing the name of the deceased, not for decoration, but for identification, by analogy to the Prophet (peace be upon him) placing the stone on the grave of Uthman bin Maz'un as proceeded in the issue referred to just now (p. 155). Al-Shawkani said: (This is restricting by analogy, and the majority have said it, not that it is an analogy opposing the text as said in [Daw' an-Nahar], but the issue is in the validity of this analogy). And what I see - and Allah knows best - is that the opinion of the validity of this analogy absolutely is far-fetched. The correct view is restricting it to when the stone does not achieve the purpose for which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) placed the stone, which is identification, due to the abundance of graves for example and the abundance of identification stones! Then it becomes permissible to write the name as much as the mentioned purpose is achieved. And Allah knows best. As for Al-Hakim's statement following the hadith: (Practice is not upon this, for the Imams of Muslims from East to West have writing on their graves, and it is a practice taken by the later generations from the early ones).

He said: And among raising graves included under the hadith entered explicitly are the domes and shrines built on graves. It is also from taking graves as mosques, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) cursed the doer of that as will come. How many evils causing Islam to weep have arisen from constructing grave buildings and beautifying them! Among them is the ignoramuses' belief in them like the disbelievers' belief in idols. It became great so they thought they were =",

As for the hadith famous on the tongues with the wording: (The best of graves are the effaced ones), it has no basis in any of the books of Sunnah, and it is denounced (Munkar) by its appearance, because the grave should not be obliterated, but should remain visible raised above the ground about a hand span as preceded, so it is known and preserved, not insulted, and visited, not abandoned. Furthermore, the apparent meaning of Fadalah's hadith (He used to order us to level graves) is leveling them with the ground so they are not raised at all. This apparent meaning is definitely not intended, evidenced by the fact that the Sunnah is raising about a hand span as previously indicated. This is supported from the hadith itself by Fadalah's saying (Lighten) meaning the earth, so he did not order removing the earth from it entirely. The scholars interpreted it this way, see (Al-Mirqat) (2/ 372). Fifth: On the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (That one of you sits on a burning coal which burns his clothes and reaches his skin is better for him than sitting (In a narration: stepping) on a grave). Narrated by Muslim (3/ 62), Abu Dawood (2/ 71), An-Nasa'i (1/ 287), Ibn Majah (1/ 484), Al-Bayhaqi (4/ 79), and Ahmad (2/ 311, 389, 444). The other narration is one of his two narrations (2/ 528). Sixth: On the authority of Uqbah bin Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (That I walk on a burning coal or a sword, or mend my sandal with my foot (1) is more beloved to me than walking on the grave of a Muslim. And I do not care whether I relieve myself in the middle of the graves or in the middle of the market). Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (4/ 133) and Ibn Majah (1/ 474) with an authentic chain as Al-Busiri said in (Az-Zawa'id) (Folio 98/ 1). Al-Mundhiri said in (At-Targhib): It is good (Jayyid).

I spoke about its chain in (Takhrij Sifat Salat an-Nabi, peace be upon him) then in (Tahdhir as-Sajid) (p. 21). In these three hadiths is evidence for the prohibition of sitting and stepping on the grave of a Muslim. This is the school of the majority of scholars as narrated by Al-Shawkani (4/ 57) and others. However, Al-Nawawi and Al-Asqalani narrated from them only dislike (Karaha), and it is the text of Imam Ash-Shafi'i in (Al-Umm) (1). Similarly, Imam Muhammad explicitly stated in (Al-Athar) (p. 45) the dislike and said: (And it is the saying of Abu Hanifa). I say: Dislike according to them, if used absolutely, implies prohibition (Tahrim). This is closer to correctness than saying just dislike. The truth is the opinion of prohibition because it is what the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and Uqbah explicitly state, due to the severe threat in them. A group of Shafi'is said this, including Al-Nawawi, and As-San'ani went to it in (Subul as-Salam) (1/ 210). The jurist Ibn Hajar Al-Haytami inclined in (Az-Zawajir) (1/ 143) to it being a major sin, due to what we indicated of severe threat, and that is not far from the truth. 7 - Praying towards graves, due to the hadith mentioned just now (Do not pray towards graves...).

Some of our companions said: There is no harm in sitting on it, and he was only forbidden from sitting on it for defecation! This is not according to us as he said, even if he was forbidden from it for the call of nature, he was forbidden from it absolutely for other than the call of nature). Al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, was referring to Imam Malik, may Allah have mercy on him, for he explicitly stated in (Al-Muwatta') the mentioned interpretation.

So he combined - meaning the hadith in full - between prohibiting disrespect by sitting, and extreme glorification). Then he said in another place: (For that is disliked. If a human intends seeking blessings by praying in that spot, he has innovated in the religion what Allah did not permit. The intended meaning is dislike of purification (Karaha Tanzih). Al-Nawawi said: Thus said our companions, and if it were said it is forbidden (Haram) due to the apparent meaning of the hadith, it would not be far-fetched. It is taken from the hadith the prohibition of prayer in the graveyard, so it is disliked with a dislike of prohibition). And it should be known that the mentioned prohibition is only if one does not intend glorification of the graves by facing them; otherwise, it is Shirk. Sheikh Ali Al-Qari said in (Al-Mirqat) (2/ 372) in his explanation of this hadith: (And if this glorification were real for the grave and its owner, the glorifier would disbelieve. So resembling it is disliked, and it should be a dislike of prohibition. In its meaning, rather more primary than it: The placed funeral (Janazah). It is among what the people of Mecca are tested with, where they place the funeral at the Kaaba then face it). 8 - Praying at them even without facing them. Regarding this, there are hadiths: First: On the authority of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (The earth is all a mosque except the graveyard and the bathhouse). Narrated by the authors of the four Sunan except An-Nasa'i - and others with an authentic chain on the condition of the two Sheikhs as Al-Hakim said and Adh-Dhahabi agreed. It was flawed by Irsal (being disconnected), but it is nothing. Even if accepted, it came from another path free from Irsal which is on the condition of Muslim. I detailed the discussion on that in (Ath-Thamar Al-Mustatab) in the sixth research of (Prayer). Second: On the authority of Anas (That the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade prayer between graves). He said in (Al-Majmu') (2/ 27) (Narrated by Al-Bazzar and its men are men of the Sahih).",

Al-Hafiz explained the reason for that in his commentary, saying in summary: (He deduced from his saying in the hadith: (do not take them as graves) that graves are not a place for worship, so prayer in them is disliked. Al-Isma'ili disputed the author in this title saying: The hadith indicates the dislike of prayer *in* the grave, not *in* the graveyards. I say: It was reported with the wording 'graveyards' as Muslim narrated from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with the wording (Do not make your houses graveyards). Ibn at-Tin said: Al-Bukhari interpreted it as the dislike of prayer in graveyards. A group interpreted it that it is an encouragement for prayer in houses, since the dead do not pray, as if he said: Do not be like the dead who do not pray in their houses which are the graves. He said: As for the permissibility of prayer in graveyards or preventing it, there is nothing in the hadith from which that is taken. I say: If he meant it is not taken from it by way of explicit wording (mantuq), then granted. If he meant denying that absolutely, then no, for we have presented the mode of his deduction. Ibn Al-Mundhir reported from most people of knowledge that they used this hadith as evidence that the graveyard is not a place for prayer.

Al-Isma'ili's saying: It indicates the dislike of prayer in the grave not in the graveyards, along with its explicit contradiction to the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, it is not proper to carry Ibn Umar's hadith on it, because prayer in the grave is not possible usually, so how can the Lawgiver's speech be carried on it!? And the saying of Ibn at-Tin: (He is one of the commentators on (Sahih Al-Bukhari) and his name is Abdul Wahid) (The dead do not pray). is not correct, because no text came in the Shari'ah denying that, and it is of the Unseen matters that should not be decided upon except with a text, and that is missing. Rather, what invalidates generalizing the saying of it has come, which is the prayer of Moses (peace be upon him) in his grave as the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw him on the Night of Isra' as Muslim narrated in his (Sahih). Likewise, the prayer of the Prophets (peace be upon them) following him on that night as proven in the (Sahih). Rather, it is proven from him (peace be upon him) that he said: (The Prophets are alive in their graves, praying). Narrated by Abu Ya'la with a good chain, and I extracted it in (Al-Ahadith As-Sahihah) (622). Rather, there came from him (peace be upon him) what is more general than what we mentioned, in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah regarding the questioning of the believer by the two angels in the grave: (It is said to him sit, so he sits while the sun is represented to him as setting. It is said to him: What do you say about this man who was among you? And what do you testify against him? He says: Leave me until I pray. They say: You will do so). Narrated by Ibn Hibban in his (Sahih) (781) and Al-Hakim (1/ 379 - 380) and he said (Authentic on the condition of Muslim) and Adh-Dhahabi agreed! But it is only Hasan, because it contains Muhammad bin Amr and Muslim did not rely on him; he only narrated for him coupled with others or as corroboration. This hadith is explicit that the believer also prays in his grave. Thus, the saying that the dead do not pray is invalidated, and it is preferred that the meaning of Ibn Umar's hadith is that the graveyard is not a place for prayer. And Allah knows best.",

Some scholars went to the invalidity of prayer in it because the prohibition indicates the corruption of the prohibited act. It is the opinion of Ibn Hazm, and chosen by Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, and Al-Shawkani in (Nayl al-Awtar) (2/ 112). Ibn Hazm narrated (4/ 27 - 28) from Imam Ahmad that he said: (Whoever prays in a graveyard or towards a grave repeats forever) (1). Then the dislike of prayer in the graveyard includes every place in it, whether the grave is in front of the worshipper, behind him, on his right, or on his left, because the prohibition is absolute. It is established in the science of Usul that the absolute is applied on its absoluteness until what restricts it comes, and nothing of that came here. Some Hanafi jurists and others explicitly stated what we mentioned as follows. Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Ilmiyyah) (p. 25): (And prayer is not valid in the graveyard nor towards it. The prohibition of that is only to block the means to Shirk. A group of our companions mentioned that a grave or two do not prevent prayer, because the name 'graveyard' does not apply to it; rather a graveyard is three graves and up.

Some of his imitators argued for him that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) prayed on the grave of the black woman! Ibn Hazm said: (And this is strange, enough of it is that these people oppose this report in what it came for, so they do not allow us to pray the funeral prayer on one who is buried, then they permit what has no trace or indication of it, contradicting the established Sunnahs. He said: All these reports are truth, so prayer is not lawful where we mentioned except the funeral prayer, for it is prayed in the graveyard, and on the grave whose owner has been buried as the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did. We forbid what he forbade, and we count doing what he did as drawing near to Allah Almighty! His command and prohibition are truth, and his action is truth, and whatever is other than that is false). I say: And in what he said regarding the funeral prayer, there is a point of view, because there is no text for its permissibility in the graveyard. If Ibn Hazm were of those who say in analogy, we would have said he analogized that to prayer *on* the grave. But he says analogy is invalid from its root. And the funeral prayer in the graveyard is contrary to the Sunnah which did not come except with praying it in the prayer place (Musalla) and in the Mosque as previously explained in its place. Rather, the explicit prohibition came regarding praying it between graves as in a narration in the hadith of Anas mentioned in this chapter, which is the second hadith of it.",

Our companions said: And everything that enters the name of graveyard from what is around the graves, one does not pray in it. This specifies that the prevention covers the prohibited zone (harim) of the single grave and its courtyard added to it. Al-Amidi and others mentioned: It is not permissible to pray in it - meaning the mosque whose Qiblah is towards the grave - until there is another barrier between the wall and the graveyard. Some of them mentioned: This is the text of Ahmad). In the words of the Sheikh, may Allah have mercy on him, is the explicit statement that the reason for prohibiting prayer in the graveyard is blocking the means (Sadd al-Dhara'i). This is one of two opinions of scholars on that. The other opinion is that the reason is the impurity of the graveyard's soil! Both are opinions in the Hanafi school. Ibn Abidin looked into the second of them in (Al-Hashiyah) (1/ 352), because transformation (Istihalah) is purifying according to them, so how can this reason be correct!? There is no doubt to us that the first opinion is the correct one, and Sheikh al-Islam explained that in his books and provided evidence for it not found with others. So refer, for example, to his book (Iqtida' as-Sirat al-Mustaqim) (152, 193). It was followed in (Al-Haniyah) from the Hanafi books. At-Tahtawi pointed to it in his footnote on (Maraqi al-Falah) saying at the author's phrase (And prayer in the graveyard is disliked) (1/ 208) (with a triple vowel on Ba', because it is imitation of Jews and Christians. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah's curse is on Jews and Christians; they took the graves of their prophets as mosques. Whether it is above him, behind him, or under what he stands on. Exceptions are the graves of Prophets, peace be upon them, so prayer is not disliked in them absolutely, whether exhumed or not, provided the grave is not in the direction of the Qiblah, because they are alive in their graves)! I say: And this exception is false, explicitly false. How so, when it contradicts the reason he mentioned and the hadith he used as evidence for it? And how can such an exception be valid when hadiths are widespread regarding cursing the People of the Book for taking the graves of their prophets as mosques, then it is authentic that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade us from that? So the prohibition is focused on taking the graves of Prophets directly, and others are attached to them. So how is it conceivable to exclude them!? The truth is that such an exception only aligns with the second opinion that the reason is impurity, and the graves of Prophets are undoubtedly pure because he (peace be upon him) said: (Verily Allah forbade the earth to eat the bodies of Prophets). But this reason is false, and what is built on falsehood is false. (1)",

When he felt distressed by it, he uncovered his face and said while in that state: 'May the curse of Allah be upon the Jews and the Christians; they took the graves of their prophets as mosques,' warning against what they did).

Second: On the authority of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said during his illness from which he did not recover: (May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians; they took the graves of their prophets as mosques). She said: Were it not for that, his grave would have been made prominent, but he feared it would be taken as a mosque. It was recorded by Al-Bukhari (3/156, 198, 8/114), Abu Awana (2/399), and Ahmad (6/80, 121, 255). He also has another route from her (6/146, 252).

As for the statement of Al-Haythami in (Majma' Al-Zawa'id) (23): (It was narrated by Abu Ya'la, and in it is Ishaq bin Abi Isra'il, regarding whom there is some discussion due to his stopping [Waqf] regarding the Quran, but the rest of its men are trustworthy), this view is questionable from several aspects: 1 - He limited the attribution to Abu Ya'la, giving the impression it is not in (Musnad Ahmad), which is not the case as you have known. 2 - The mentioned Ishaq is trustworthy (Thiqah), and his stopping regarding the Quran is not a valid disparagement as established in the science of Hadith terminology. 3 - He was not the only one to narrate it; it is in Ahmad through a route other than his. Thus, the Hadith is authentic without doubt. It has a Mursal supporting evidence recorded by Malik in (Al-Muwatta) (1/185-186) with a Sahih chain. It was also narrated as connected (Mawsul) from Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri. Fifth: On the authority of Jundub, who said: I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, five days before he died, saying: [I certainly had brothers and friends among you, and] I declare myself clear before Allah from taking a Khalil (close friend) from among you, for Allah the Exalted has taken me as a Khalil just as He took Ibrahim as a Khalil. If I were to take a Khalil from my Ummah, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a Khalil. Beware! Those before you used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous people as mosques. Beware! Do not take graves as mosques; I forbid you from that). It was recorded by Muslim (2/67-68) excluding the other six. Al-Shawkani (2/114) also attributed it to Al-Nasa'i, perhaps meaning his (Al-Sunan Al-Kubra), as he did not attribute it in (Al-Dhakha'ir) except to Muslim alone. Yes, Abu Awana recorded it in his (Sahih) (2/401), and the addition is his. Sixth: On the authority of Abdullah bin Mas'ud, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying: (Indeed, among the worst of people are those upon whom the Hour comes while they are alive, and those who take graves as mosques). It was recorded by Ahmad (No. 3844, 4143, 4144, 4342) with two Hasan (good) chains from him. It was also narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah and Ibn Hibban in his (Sahih), and Ibn Taymiyyah said:",

Seventh: On the authority of Aisha, who said: (When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was ill, some of his wives mentioned a church in the land of Abyssinia called 'Mariyah'—Umm Salamah and Umm Habibah had been to the land of Abyssinia—and they mentioned its beauty and its images. She said: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: Indeed, those people, when a righteous man among them [died], they built a mosque over his grave, then they painted those images in it. Those are the worst of creation in the sight of Allah [on the Day of Judgment]). It was recorded by Al-Bukhari (1/416, 422), Muslim (2/66-67), Al-Nasa'i (1/115), as well as Abu Awana (2/400-401), Al-Bayhaqi (4/80)—the wording is theirs—Ahmad (6/51), and Ibn Abi Shaybah (4/140). The two additions belong to him, the two Sheikhs, and others. In this chapter, there are other hadiths from a group of other Companions, which I cited in (Tahdhir Al-Sajid min Ittikhadh Al-Qubur Masajid). They indicate decisively that taking graves as mosques is Haram (forbidden) because of the curse upon those who do so. Therefore, the jurist Al-Haytami said in (Al-Zawajir) (1/120-121): (The ninety-third major sin: Taking graves as mosques). Then he cited some of the preceding hadiths and others not meeting our criteria, then said: (Counting this as a major sin appeared in the speech of some Shafi'is, and it seems he took that from what is mentioned in these hadiths. Its reasoning is clear, because he cursed those who did that to the graves of their prophets, and he made those who did that to the graves of their righteous ones the worst of creation in the sight of Allah on the Day of Judgment. This contains a warning for us, as in the narration (warning against what they did), meaning he warns his Ummah by telling them that, lest they do as those did, and thus be cursed as they were cursed... Some Hanbalis said: A man's intention to pray at a grave seeking blessing by it is the essence of opposing Allah and His Messenger, and innovating a religion which Allah has not authorized. There is prohibition against it, then consensus,",

    "text": "for the greatest of prohibitions and causes of Shirk (polytheism) is praying at them, taking them as mosques, or building over them. The opinion of [mere] dislike (Karahah) is interpreted to mean other than that, for it is not thought of scholars that they would permit an act for which the curse upon its doer has been mutawatir (mass transmitted) from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. It is obligatory to hasten to demolish them and demolish the domes over the graves, for they are more harmful than the Mosque of Harm (Masjid al-Dirar) because they were founded on disobedience to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, because he forbade that. And the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded the leveling of elevated graves. It is obligatory to remove every lamp or lantern on a grave, and endowing or vowing for it is invalid. End quote). This 'taking' mentioned in the preceding hadiths includes several matters: First: Praying towards the graves, facing them. Second: Prostrating on the graves. Third: Building mosques over them. The second meaning is apparent from 'taking', and the other two, while included in it, have been explicitly mentioned in some of the preceding hadiths. I have detailed the discussion on that and cited the sayings of scholars as evidence in our specific book (Tahdhir Al-Sajid min Ittikhadh Al-Qubur Masajid) [Warning the Prostrator against Taking Graves as Mosques], and I mentioned therein the history of the inclusion of the Prophetic Grave into the Noble Mosque, and the opposition to the preceding hadiths therein, and that prayer is not disliked in it specifically (due to necessity/context). Whoever wishes to see the detailed discussion on all of that should refer to it. 10 - Taking it as an 'Eid' (Festival): Intending to visit it at specific times and known seasons for worship there, or for other reasons. This is due to the hadith of Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: (Do not take my grave as an 'Eid' (festival), and do not make your houses graves, and send blessings upon me wherever you are, for your blessings reach me). It was recorded by Abu Dawood (1/319) and Ahmad (2/367) with a Hasan chain, and it meets the criteria of Muslim. It is authentic due to its routes and supporting evidences. It has another route from Abu Huraira in Abu Nu'aym's (Al-Hilyah) (6/283).",

He said: 'Come to supper.' I said: 'I do not want it.' He said: 'Why did I see you at the Grave?' I said: 'I greeted the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said: 'When you enter the mosque, greet him.' Then he said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: 'Do not take my grave as an 'Eid', nor take your houses as graves, and send blessings upon me, for your blessings reach me wherever you are. May Allah curse the Jews; they took the graves of their prophets as mosques.' You and those in Andalusia are but the same). Narrated by Sa'id bin Mansur as in (Al-Iqtida') by Ibn Taymiyyah. It is also with Sheikh Ismail bin Ishaq Al-Qadi in (Fadl Al-Salah 'ala Al-Nabi, peace be upon him) (No. 30)(1) without the phrase (May Allah curse the Jews...). Ibn Abi Shaybah also narrated it (4/140) limiting it to the Marfu' (elevated to the Prophet) part only. It has another witness similar to this from the route of Ali bin Al-Hussein from his father from his grandfather, Marfu'. It was recorded by Ismail Al-Qadi (No. 20) and others. See (Tahdhir Al-Sajid) (98-99). The hadith is proof of the prohibition of taking the graves of prophets and righteous people as an 'Eid'. Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in (Al-Iqtida') (pp. 155-156): (The indication is that the grave of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is the best grave on the face of the earth, yet he forbade taking it as an 'Eid'. So, the grave of anyone else is more deserving of the prohibition, whoever he may be. Then he coupled that with his saying: 'And do not make your houses graves'), meaning do not empty them of prayer, supplication, and recitation, such that they become like graves. So he commanded seeking worship in houses and forbade seeking it at graves, contrary to what the polytheists among the Christians and those who imitate them do. He said: This is the best of the Tabi'in from his household, Ali bin Al-Hussein, may Allah be pleased with them, forbidding that man from seeking to supplicate at his grave, peace be upon him, and reasoning with the hadith he heard from his father Al-Hussein from his grandfather Ali.

    "text": "that a man intending the grave to greet him and the like, other than when entering the mosque, and viewing that as supplication and the like, constitutes taking it as an 'Eid'. Similarly, his cousin Hasan bin Hasan, the sheikh of his household, disliked taking it as an 'Eid'. Look at this Sunnah, how its source is from the people of Medina and the Ahl al-Bayt, who have the closeness of lineage and location to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for they were in more need of that than others, so they were more disciplined regarding it. 'Eid', if used as a name for a place, is the place intended for gathering and coming to for worship or other than worship, just as the Sacred Mosque, Mina, Muzdalifah, and Arafat were made by Allah as an 'Eid' and a place of return for people, where they gather and frequent for supplication, remembrance, and rituals. The polytheists had places they frequented for gathering; when Islam came, Allah erased all of that. This type of place includes the graves of prophets and righteous people). Then the Sheikh said (pp. 175-181): (For this reason, Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, and others of the people of knowledge disliked for the people of Medina that every time one of them entered the mosque, he would go and greet the grave of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his two companions. He said: This is only for one of them if he arrives from a journey or intends a journey and the like. Some permitted greeting him when entering the mosque for prayer and the like, but as for intending it constantly for prayer and greeting, I know of no one who permitted it, because that is a type of taking it as an 'Eid'... even though it has been prescribed for us when we enter the mosque to say ('Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings') (1) just as we say that at the end of our prayer. He said: So Malik and others feared that doing that at the grave every hour would be a type of taking the grave as an 'Eid'. Also, that is an innovation (Bid'ah), for the Muhajirun and Ansar during the time of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali, may Allah be pleased with them, used to come to the mosque every day knowing, may Allah be pleased with them, what",

Its remoteness is obvious, especially since the formula came in the hadith of Fatima, may Allah be pleased with her, with the wording (Peace be upon the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad).

How excellent is what Malik said: 'The latter part of this nation will not be rectified except by what rectified its first part.' But whenever nations' adherence to the covenants of their prophets weakens, and their faith decreases, they compensate for that with what they innovate of heresies, Shirk, and other things. For this reason, the Ummah disliked touching the grave and kissing it. And they built a structure preventing people from praying towards it. He said: We have mentioned from Ahmad and others that he commanded whoever greeted the Prophet and his two companions and then wanted to supplicate, to turn away and face the Qiblah. Likewise, the early scholars like Malik and others denounced that, and the later ones like Abu Al-Wafa' Ibn Aqil and Abu Al-Faraj Ibn Al-Jawzi. I do not memorize from any Companion, nor Tabi'i, nor known Imam that he recommended intending any grave for supplication at it, nor did anyone narrate anything regarding that, neither from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, nor from his Companions, nor from any of the known Imams. People have written about supplication, its times, and its places, and mentioned narrations therein, yet none of them mentioned a single letter about the virtue of supplication at graves as far as I know. So how can it be permissible, given this situation, that supplication at them is more answered and better, while the Salaf denounce it, do not recognize it, forbid it, and do not command it!? He said: The belief in the responsiveness of supplication at them and its virtue has necessitated that they be frequented and intended for that reason, and perhaps many gatherings occur at them in specific seasons. This is exactly what the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade by saying: (Do not take my grave as an 'Eid'). He said: Even some graves are gathered at on a day of the year, and people travel to them either in Muharram, Rajab, Sha'ban, Dhul-Hijjah, or others. Some gather at them on the day of Ashura, some on the day of Arafah, and some on the middle of Sha'ban, and some at another time, such that they have a day of the year in which they are intended and gathered at, just as Arafah, Muzdalifah, and Mina are intended on known days of the year, and just as the prayer place of the city is intended on the two Eid days. Nay, perhaps the concern for these gatherings in religion and worldly matters is more important and intense [to them]. Among them are those traveled to from regions at a specific time, or an unspecified time, intending supplication there and worship there, just as the Sacred House of Allah is intended for that. This travel, I know of no disagreement among Muslim scholars regarding its prohibition. He said:",

In summary, what is done at these graves is exactly what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade by saying: (Do not take my grave as an 'Eid'). For the habit of intending a specific place at a specific time, recurring with the return of the year, month, or week, is exactly the meaning of 'Eid'. Then he forbids the small and large aspects of that. This is what was previously mentioned from Imam Ahmad regarding his denunciation. He (meaning Ahmad) said: People have gone to great excess in this and have done much. And he mentioned what is done at the grave of Al-Hussein. Then the Sheikh said: This includes what is done in Egypt at the grave of Nafisa and others, and what is done in Iraq at the grave said to be the grave of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, and the grave of Al-Hussein, and Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman, and... and... and what is done at the grave of Abu Yazid Al-Bistami to many graves in most lands of Islam that cannot be counted. He said: Making a habit of intending these graves at a specific time, and the general gathering at them at a specific time, is taking them as an 'Eid' as preceded, and I know of no disagreement among the Muslim scholars regarding that. One should not be deceived by the multitude of corrupt customs, for this is from the imitation of the People of the Two Books (Jews and Christians) which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, informed us would happen in this Ummah. The root of that is solely the belief in the virtue of supplication at them; otherwise, if this belief were not established in the hearts, all of that would be erased. So if intending them leads to these evils, it is Haram (forbidden) like praying at them, and even more so, and that is a trial (Fitnah) for creation, an opening of the door to Shirk, and a closing of the door to Faith). I say: And what enters into this primarily is what is witnessed today in Medina Munawwarah, of people intending the grave of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after every obligatory prayer to greet him and supplicate at him and by him, raising their voices before him, such that the mosque buzzes with them, especially in the Hajj season, as if that were one of the Sunnahs of prayer! Indeed, they maintain this more than they maintain the Sunnahs. All of this happens within the sight and hearing of the authorities, and none of them denounces it. To Allah we belong and to Him we return. Alas for the strangeness of the religion and its people, and in the Mosque of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which should be the furthest of mosques, after the Sacred Mosque, from contradicting his Sharia, peace be upon him. Having said this, it has preceded in the words of Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah that some scholars permitted coming to the Noble Grave to greet him when entering the mosque for prayer and the like.

I say: This permission which the Sheikh narrated from some scholars is what we narrate and rely upon, subject to the mentioned condition. Thus, it is permissible for someone in Medina to come to the Noble Grave to greet him, peace be upon him, occasionally, because that is not taking it as an 'Eid' as is apparent. Greeting him and his two companions is prescribed by general evidences, so it is not permissible to negate its legitimacy absolutely due to his prohibition, peace be upon him, against taking his grave as an 'Eid', because it is possible to reconcile [the texts] by observing the condition we mentioned. It does not contradict this that we do not know that any of the Salaf used to do that, because lack of knowledge of a thing does not necessitate knowledge of its non-existence, as scholars say. In such a case, general evidences are sufficient to establish its legitimacy as long as nothing contradicting them is proven in our context. Furthermore, Sheikh Al-Islam mentioned in (Al-Qa'idah Al-Jalilah) (p. 80, Al-Manar edition) from Nafi' that he said: Ibn Umar used to greet the Grave. I saw him a hundred times or more coming to the Grave saying: 'Peace be upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, peace be upon Abu Bakr, peace be upon my father,' then he would leave. Its appearance suggests he used to do that while being a resident, not traveling, because his saying 'a hundred times' makes it unlikely to interpret this narration as being in the state of travel... 11 - Traveling to them: There are hadiths regarding this: First: On the authority of Abu Huraira from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who said: (Mounts are not to be saddled [for travel] except to three mosques: The Sacred Mosque, the Mosque of the Messenger, peace be upon him, and the Farthest Mosque [Al-Aqsa]).

Recorded by the two Sheikhs and others. It has four routes from him which I cited in the previous source. The other wording belongs to Muslim. The fourth route: Narrated by Shahr bin Hawshab, and from him two people: One of them: Layth bin Abi Sulaym from him, who said: (We met Abu Sa'id while we were intending [to go to] Tur [Mount Sinai], so he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying: Mounts should not be worked except...) the Hadith. The other: Abdul Hamid bin Bahram from him, who said: (I heard Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, and prayer at Tur was mentioned in his presence, so he said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: It is not befitting for mounts to have their saddles fastened to a mosque in which prayer is sought other than the Sacred Mosque...). The Hadith. Ahmad recorded both (3/93, 64). Shahr is weak, and he is alone in this addition (to a mosque in which prayer is sought), so it is Munkar (denounced) due to its absence in other routes from Abu Sa'id, even in the route of Layth from Shahr. Likewise, it did not appear in the other hadiths, which are eight, most of which have more than one route. I have cited all of them in (Al-Thamar Al-Mustatab). The absence of this addition in any of these hadiths, despite their abundance and multiple sources, is the greatest proof of the addition's oddity and invalidity. It is from the delusions of Shahr bin Hawshab or the narrator from him, Abdul Hamid, for there is some weakness in him regarding his memory.

Fourth: On the authority of Qaza'a who said: (I wanted to go out to Tur, so I asked Ibn Umar, and he said: Did you not know that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: (Mounts are not to be saddled except to three mosques: The Sacred Mosque, the Mosque of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the Farthest Mosque), so leave Tur alone and do not go to it). Recorded by Al-Azraqi (in Akhbar Makkah) (p. 304) with a Sahih chain whose men are men of the Sahih. Al-Haythami cited the Marfu' part in (Al-Majma') (4/4) and said: (Recorded by Al-Tabarani in Al-Kabir and Al-Awsat, and its men are trustworthy). In these hadiths is the prohibition of traveling to any blessed place, such as the graves of prophets and righteous people. Even if it is in the form of negation (not to be saddled), the meaning is prohibition as Al-Hafiz said, on the pattern of His saying: (There is no sexual intercourse, nor disobedience, nor disputing in Hajj), which is as Al-Tibi said: (It is more emphatic than explicit prohibition, as if he said: It is not correct that a journey be intended except to these places due to their specific exclusivity).",

    "text": "I say: What attests to the negation here being in the sense of prohibition is a narration by Muslim in the second hadith: (Do not saddle). Then Al-Hafiz said: (His saying: 'except to three mosques', the exception is emptied [Mufarragh], and the estimation is: Saddles are not fastened to a place, and its implication is preventing travel to every place other than them, because the excluded-from in the emptied exception is estimated as the most general of the general. But it is possible that the general intended here is specific, which is the mosque). I say: This probability is weak, and the correct view is the first estimation. Because of what preceded in the hadith of Abu Basra and Ibn Umar regarding the denunciation of travel to Tur. Its clarification will come. Then Al-Hafiz said: (In this hadith is the virtue of these mosques and their advantage over others due to being the mosques of Prophets, and because the first is the Qiblah of the people and to it is their Hajj, the second was the Qiblah of past nations, and the third was founded on piety. [He said:] Opinions differed regarding saddling mounts to other than them, like going to visit the righteous, living or dead, and to virtuous places, intending blessing by them and praying in them. Sheikh Abu Muhammad Al-Juwayni (1) said: (It is forbidden to saddle mounts to other than them, acting upon the apparent meaning of the hadith). Al-Qadi Hussein indicated his choice of this, and Iyad and a group said it. This is indicated by what the authors of the Sunan narrated regarding Abu Basra Al-Ghifari's objection to Abu Huraira for his going out to Tur, saying to him: 'Had I caught you before you went out, you would not have gone out,' and he used this hadith as evidence. This indicates he sees the hadith should be taken on its general meaning, and Abu Huraira agreed with him. The correct view according to Imam Al-Haramayn and others of the Shafi'is is that it is not forbidden, and they answered the hadith with answers: 1 - That the meaning is that complete virtue is only in saddling mounts to these mosques contrary to others, for that is permissible. It occurred in a narration by Ahmad which will be mentioned with the wording: 'It is not befitting for mounts to be worked', which is a wording apparent in other than prohibition.",

    "text": "2 - That the prohibition is specific to one who vows upon himself to pray in a mosque from the other mosques apart from the three, for fulfillment of it is not obligatory. This was said by Ibn Battal. 3 - That the meaning is the ruling of mosques only, and that mounts are not saddled to a mosque of the mosques to pray in it other than these three. As for intending other than mosques to visit a righteous person, relative, friend, seeking a scholar, trade, or recreation, it does not enter into the prohibition. This is supported by what Ahmad narrated from the route of Shahr bin Hawshab who said: I heard Abu Sa'id - and prayer at Tur was mentioned in his presence - so he said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: 'It is not befitting for mounts to have their saddles fastened to a mosque in which prayer is sought other than the Sacred Mosque, the Farthest Mosque, and this Mosque of mine.' Shahr is Hasan in Hadith, even if there is some weakness in him). I say: Al-Hafiz, may Allah have mercy on him, was lenient in his saying about Shahr that he is Hasan in Hadith. Even though he said about him in (Al-Taqrib): (Makes many mistakes) as preceded. It is known that whoever is like that, his hadith is weak and not used as proof, as Al-Hafiz himself established in (Sharh Al-Nukhba). Then assume he is Hasan in Hadith; he is only so when there is no contradiction. But since he has contradicted all narrators who narrated the hadith from Abu Sa'id, and others who narrated it from other Companions as explained, how can he be Hasan in Hadith with this contradiction!? Rather, he is Munkar (denounced) in Hadith in such a case, without any doubt or suspicion. Add to that his saying in the hadith (to a mosque), which is not established from Shahr himself, for Abdul Hamid mentioned it from him while Layth bin Abi Sulaym did not mention it from him, and this narration from him is weightier for agreeing with the narrations of the trustworthy ones as you knew. Also, whoever contemplates his hadith finds in it another proof of the invalidity of mentioning this addition in it, which is his statement: That Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri used the hadith as argument against Shahr for his going to Tur. If it contained this addition which restricts its ruling to mosques excluding other virtuous places, it would not be permissible for Abu Sa'id, may Allah be pleased with him, to use it as argument against him, because Tur is not a mosque. Rather, it is the holy mountain upon which Allah spoke to Moses, so the hadith would not include it if the addition were established in it. And Abu Sa'id's reasoning with it, in this case, would be a delusion, which is inconceivable that Shahr and those with him would remain silent about. All of this confirms the invalidity of this addition and that it has no basis from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.",

So, it is obligatory to remain on its general meaning, which Abu Muhammad Al-Juwayni and those mentioned with him went to. And it is the truth. It remains for us to answer their first and second answers, so I say: 1 - This answer is invalid from two aspects: First: That the wording they used as proof (It is not befitting...) is not established in the hadith because Shahr was alone in it, and he is weak as previously explained. Second: Even if it were an established wording, we do not concede that it is apparent in other than prohibition. Rather, the opposite is correct, and evidences for that from the Book and Sunnah are many. I will suffice with some: A - His statement, Exalted is He: (They said: Glory be to You! It was not befitting for us to take allies besides You) [Al-Furqan: 18]. B - His statement, peace be upon him: (It is not befitting that anyone should punish with fire except the Lord of the fire). Narrated by Abu Dawood (2675) from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, and Al-Darimi (2/222) from the hadith of Abu Huraira. C - (It is not befitting for a truthful man to be a curser). Narrated by Muslim. D - (Indeed, charity is not befitting for the family of Muhammad...). Narrated by Muslim. E - (It is not befitting for a slave to say: I am better than Yunus bin Matta). Narrated by Al-Bukhari. Third: Assume it is apparent in other than prohibition; it indicates dislike (Karahah), and they do not say [even] that. For in (Sharh Muslim) by Al-Nawawi: (The correct view according to our companions is that it is neither forbidden nor disliked)!",

    "text": "So the hadith is an argument against them in any case. 2 - This answer, like the one before it, is devoid of consideration, because there is no evidence for specification. The obligation is to remain on the general meaning, especially since it is supported by the understanding of the Companions who narrated the Hadith: Abu Basra, Abu Huraira, Ibn Umar, and Abu Sa'id - if authentic from him. They all used it as evidence for the prevention of traveling to Tur, and they are more knowledgeable of its intended meaning than others. Therefore, Al-San'ani said in (Subul Al-Salam) (2/251): (The majority went to the view that it is not forbidden, and they used evidence that does not stand, and interpreted the hadith of the chapter with far-fetched interpretations. Interpretation is not befitting unless the evidence stands against what they interpreted). (Fath Al-'Allam) added after it (1/310): (And there is no evidence. The hadiths narrated encouraging the Prophetic visit and its virtue do not contain the command to saddle mounts to it, alongside the fact that they are all weak or fabricated; none of them is fit for reasoning. Most people did not notice the difference between the issue of visiting and the issue of traveling for it, so they diverted the hadith of the chapter from its clear explicit meaning without evidence calling for it). I say: Due to the confusion referred to, Sheikh Al-Subki, may Allah forgive us and him, accused Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah of denying the visit to the Prophetic Grave even without saddling a mount, whereas he was among those who stated it [is permitted] and mentioned its virtue and etiquettes. He cited that in more than one of his good books (1). The scholar Al-Hafiz Muhammad bin Abdul Hadi undertook clarifying this truth and refuting Al-Subki's accusation in a large work titled (Al-Sarim Al-Munki fi Al-Radd 'ala Al-Subki) [The Sharp Sword in Refuting Al-Subki]: He quoted therein from Ibn Taymiyyah many texts regarding the permissibility of visiting without traveling for it. He cited therein the hadiths narrated regarding its virtue, discussed them in detail, and clarified the weakness and fabrication in them. In it are many other benefits, jurisprudential, hadith-related, and historical, worthy for every student of knowledge to strive to view.",

    "text": "Furthermore, sound reasoning judges the correctness of the saying of those who went to the view that the hadith remains on its general meaning. Because if explicitly it prevents traveling to a mosque other than the three mosques, knowing that worship in any mosque is better than in a non-mosque, and he, peace be upon him, said: (The most beloved of places to Allah are mosques), even if that mosque is the mosque founded on piety, namely the Quba Mosque about which the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: (A prayer in the Quba Mosque is like an Umrah), if the matter is so, then for the hadith to prevent traveling to other places is more worthy and appropriate. Especially if the intention is a mosque built on the grave of a prophet or righteous person, for the sake of praying in it and worshipping at it. You have known the curse upon whoever does that, so is it conceivable that the Wise Lawgiver allows traveling to such a thing and prevents traveling to the Quba Mosque!? Conclusion: What Abu Muhammad Al-Juwayni Al-Shafi'i and others went to regarding the prohibition of traveling to other than the three mosques among virtuous places is what must be resorted to. No wonder major investigative scholars known for their independence in understanding and depth in Fiqh from Allah and His Messenger chose it, such as the two Sheikhs of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on them, for they have many beneficial researches on this important issue. Among these virtuous ones is Sheikh Waliullah Al-Dehlawi; among his words on that is what he said in (Hujjat Allah Al-Baligha) (1/192): (The people of Jahiliyyah used to intend places glorified in their claim, visiting them and seeking blessing by them. In this was distortion and corruption not hidden. So he, peace be upon him, blocked the corruption, lest other than rituals be attached to rituals, and lest it becomes a means to worshipping other than Allah. The truth according to me is that the grave, the place of worship of a saint among saints, and Tur [Mount Sinai] are all equal in the prohibition). It is good to point out in the conclusion of this research that traveling for trade and seeking knowledge does not enter into the prohibition, for the travel is only to seek that need wherever it is, not for the specificity of the place. Likewise, traveling to visit a brother in Allah, for he is the intended one, as Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in (Al-Fatawa) (2/186). 12 - Lighting lamps over them. The evidence for that is several matters:",

Narrated by Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Khuzaimah in his (Sahih) with a Sahih chain. Second: It involves wasting money, which is forbidden by the text as preceded in Issue (42 p. 64). Third: It involves imitation of the Majus (Zoroastrians), worshippers of fire. Ibn Hajar the Jurist said in (Al-Zawajir) (1/134): (Our companions stated explicitly the prohibition of a lamp on a grave, even if small, where no resident or visitor benefits from it. They reasoned it with extravagance, wasting money, and imitation of the Majus. It is not far-fetched in this case that it be a major sin). I say: He did not cite, in addition to the reasoning mentioned, our first evidence, though it is a valid evidence, possibly the strongest of evidences. Because those who light lamps on graves only intend thereby to draw closer to Allah the Exalted - so they claim - and do not intend illumination for a resident or visitor, evidenced by their lighting them while the sun is rising in the broad daylight! Thus, for that reason, it was a misguided innovation. If it is said: Why did you not use as evidence the famous hadith narrated by the authors of Sunan and others from Ibn Abbas: (Allah cursed the female visitors of graves, and those who take mosques and lamps over them)? My answer to it: This hadith, despite its fame, has a weak chain; it does not stand as proof. Even if many authors were lenient and included it in this chapter and remained silent about its defect, as Ibn Hajar did in (Al-Zawajir), and before him the scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim in (Zad Al-Ma'ad), and the masses of Salafis and Ahl al-Hadith were deceived by it so they used it as proof in their books, letters, and lectures. I had criticized Ibn Al-Qayyim for that in what I commented on his book, and I clarified the defect of the hadith in detail there, then in (Silsilat Al-Ahadith Al-Da'ifah) (No. 223). Then I saw Ibn Al-Qayyim in (Tahdhib Al-Sunan) (4/342) quoting Abdul Haq Al-Ishbili that in the chain of the hadith is Badham, the companion of Al-Kalbi, and he is very weak according to them. Ibn Al-Qayyim affirmed him. Praise be to Allah for His success.

This is supported by a narration by Ahmad with the wording: (He said: They view that it is in sin. Abdul Razzaq said: I think it is the saying of Dawood). I say: Meaning Dawood bin Qays, who is the sheikh of Abdul Razzaq in it. It is apparent that this explanation is what is intended by the Hadith. Al-Tahawi asserted this and dedicated a specific chapter for it in his (Mushkil), so let whoever wishes refer to it. The Hadith is proof of the prohibition of breaking the bone of a dead believer. For this reason, it came in the Hanbali books: (It is forbidden to cut anything from the limbs of the dead, destroy his essence, or burn him, even if he willed it). So in (Kashshaf Al-Qina') (2/127), and similar in other schools. Indeed, Ibn Hajar the Jurist asserted in (Al-Zawajir) (1/134) that it is among the major sins. He said: (Because you knew from the Hadith that it is like breaking the bone of the living) (1)",
    "foot_note": "1. (1) The Hanbalis went to extremes in that, such that they said as in (Al-Kashshaf) (2/130): (If a pregnant woman dies with a fetus whose life is hoped for, it is forbidden to cut open her belly for the sake of the pregnancy, whether she is Muslim or Dhimmi, because of the violation of a certain sanctity for the survival of a presumed life, because the dominant probability and appearance is that the child will not live. Ahmad argued for that in the narration of Abu Dawood with what Aisha narrated...). I say: Then he mentioned the Hadith and the text of Abu Dawood in (Al-Masa'il) (p. 150): (I heard Ahmad asked about a woman who dies and the child moves in her belly, should she be cut open? He said: No, breaking the bone of the dead is like breaking it when alive). Sayyid Muhammad Rashid Rida commented on it saying: (Using it as evidence to leave a living fetus in its mother's belly to die absolutely has strangeness from two aspects: First: Cutting the belly does not involve breaking a bone of the dead. Second: If the fetus is fully formed and removed from its mother's belly by cutting it, it may live as happens repeatedly. So here is saving it and preserving its life, while preserving the dignity of its mother based on cutting the belly being like breaking a bone. There is no doubt that the first is weightier, moreover, cutting the belly for such a reason is not considered an insult to the dead as is apparent in the custom of all people. The correct view is the saying of those who obligate cutting the belly and extracting it if the doctor considers its life probable after exit. Some of them stated this explicitly). And he said in Manar Al-Sabil (1/178): And if part of it comes out alive, it is cut for the remainder due to the certainty of its life after it was presumed. I say: What Sayyid, may Allah have mercy on him, chose is the most correct view according to the Shafi'is as Al-Nawawi said (5/301), and he attributed it to the saying of Abu Hanifa and most jurists, and it is the school of Ibn Hazm (5/166-167), and it is the truth if Allah the Exalted wills.",

    "text": "Benefited from the Hadith: 1 - The sanctity of exhuming the grave of a Muslim because it exposes his bones to breakage. Therefore, some of the Salaf disliked being buried in a graveyard where burial is frequent. Imam Al-Shafi'i said in (Al-Umm) (1/245): (Malik informed us from Hisham bin Urwah from his father who said: I do not like to be buried in Baqi'! To be buried elsewhere is more beloved to me. It is only one of two men: Either an oppressor, so I do not like to be in his vicinity, or a righteous man, so I do not like for his bones to be exhumed. He said: And if the bones of a dead person are brought out, I would like them to be returned and buried). Al-Nawawi said in (Al-Majmu') (5/303) in summary: (It is not permissible to exhume a grave for other than a legal reason by agreement of the Companions [Shafi'i scholars]. It is permissible for legal reasons like what preceded (in Issue 109). Summary: It is permissible to exhume the grave if the dead has decayed and become dust; then it is permissible to bury another in it. It is permissible to cultivate that land and build on it, and all modes of benefit and disposal in it by agreement of the Companions. This is all if no trace of bone or other remains of the dead. This varies with the variation of lands and earth. The word of experts regarding it is relied upon). I say: From this, you know the prohibition of what some Islamic governments commit of leveling some Islamic graveyards and exhuming them for the sake of urban planning, without any regard for their sanctity, or concern for the prohibition of treading on them and breaking their bones and the like. Let no one imagine that the mentioned planning justifies such violations. Nay, for it is not among the necessities, but among the luxuries which do not justify aggression against the dead. It is upon the living to organize their affairs without harming their dead. Among the wonders that draw attention is seeing these governments respecting stones and buildings standing over some dead more than their respect for the dead themselves. For if some of these buildings of domes or churches and the like stood in the way of the alleged planning, they would leave them as they are and adjust the planning map for their sake to preserve them, because they consider them ancient monuments!",

    "text": "As for the graves of the dead themselves, they do not deserve such adjustment according to them! Rather, some of those governments strive—as far as we know—to place graves outside the town and prevent burial in old graves. This is another violation in my view, because it causes Muslims to miss the Sunnah of visiting graves, as it is not easy for the common people to travel long distances to be able to reach them, visit them, and pray for them! The motive for these violations—I believe—is nothing but blind imitation of materialist, disbelieving Europe, which wants to eliminate every manifestation of belief in the Hereafter and everything that reminds of it, not the observance of health rules as they claim. If that were true, they would have hastened to fight causes which no rational person doubts the harm of, such as selling alcohol and drinking it, and immorality and debauchery in its various forms and names. Their lack of concern for eliminating these apparent evils, and their striving to remove everything that reminds of the Hereafter and keep it away from their eyes, is the greatest proof that the intent is contrary to what they claim and declare, and what their chests conceal is greater. 2 - That there is no sanctity for the bones of non-believers, due to the attribution of the bone to the believer in his saying: (bone of the believer). It implied that the bone of the disbeliever is not so. Al-Hafiz indicated this meaning in (Al-Fath) by saying: (It is benefited from it that the sanctity of the believer after his death remains as it was during his life) (1). From this, the answer to the question frequently asked by many students in medical colleges is known, which is: Is it permissible to break bones to examine them and conduct medical investigations on them? The answer: It is not permissible for the bones of a believer, and it is permissible for others. This is supported by what comes in the following issue: 129 - It is permissible to exhume the graves of disbelievers, because they have no sanctity as indicated by the concept of the previous Hadith. Witness to it is the hadith of Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, who said:",

He stayed among them for fourteen nights. Then he sent for Banu Al-Najjar, and they came with swords hanging from their necks. It is as if I am looking at the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on his mount with Abu Bakr behind him, and a group of Banu Al-Najjar around him, until he arrived at the courtyard of Abu Ayyub. He used to like to pray wherever the prayer caught him, and he would pray in sheepfolds. He ordered the building of the mosque, so he sent for a group of Banu Al-Najjar and said: 'O Banu Al-Najjar, name a price for this garden of yours.' They said: 'No, by Allah, we do not ask for its price except from Allah.' He said: In it were graves of the polytheists, ruins, and date palms. So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered the graves of the polytheists, and they were exhumed; then the ruins, and they were leveled; and the date palms, and they were cut. They aligned the date palms towards the Qiblah of the mosque and made its jambs of stone. They began moving the rock while chanting poetry, and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was with them saying: [while moving the bricks: This burden (1) is not the burden of Khaybar * This is more righteous to our Lord and purer] O Allah, there is no good except the good of the Hereafter * So forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirah. In a narration from the hadith of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her: O Allah, the reward is the reward of the Hereafter * So have mercy on the Ansar and the Muhajirah). Recorded by the two Sheikhs and others from the hadith of Anas, and the context is his. Al-Bukhari recorded it from the hadith of Aisha, and what is between the brackets is from her. I have recorded the two hadiths in (Al-Thamar Al-Mustatab). Al-Hafiz said in (Al-Fath): (In the Hadith is the permissibility of disposal in a graveyard owned by gift and sale, the permissibility of exhuming obliterated graves if they are not respected [i.e., of non-Muslims], the permissibility of praying in the graveyards of polytheists after exhuming them and removing what is in them, and the permissibility of building mosques in their places).",

But it is present with me, and it is part of extensive material I had started collecting more than a year ago to compose a comprehensive book gathering various religious innovations, suitable to be like a dictionary for them. I extracted them from dozens of books, and I had a few other books left to read to then turn to arranging them all and composing it. But I was diverted from it, so I seized this opportunity and extracted from the material I have the mentioned chapter, and arranged it in the order intended for the original, as you will see. It is that I quote the innovation from the book I extracted it from in its text or meaning, then follow it by indicating the part number and page from it. If I do not follow it with anything, that is an indication that it is from me, and my knowledge led to it being among innovations. These are very few compared to the abundant material of the chapter or the book. Before starting to list them, it is necessary to mention the rules and foundations upon which this chapter was built, following the original, so I say:",

She said: Look at the grave of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and make a skylight from it towards the sky so that there is no roof between it and the sky. He said: So they did, and we were rained upon until the grass grew and the camels became fat until they burst from fat, so it was named the Year of Bursting [Al-Fatq]) - it is not authentic. Recorded by Al-Darimi in his Sunan (1/43-44) and in it is Abu Al-Nu'man, who is Muhammad bin Al-Fadl known as 'Arim', and he had become confused in the end of his life as Al-Uqayli and others of the people of Hadith said. Sheikh Al-Islam said in Al-Radd 'ala Al-Bakri (p. 68): (And what was narrated from Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, of opening a skylight from his grave to the sky so rain would descend is not authentic, nor is its chain established. He said: What clarifies the lie of this is that during the lifetime of Aisha, the house did not have a skylight; rather, part of it remained as it was during the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, partly roofed and partly open, and the sun used to descend into it as established in the two Sahihs from her that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to pray Asr while the sun was in her chamber and the shadow had not yet appeared). \n2. It is regrettable that this innovation and the two after it were quoted from (Kitab Al-Madkhal) by Ibn Al-Hajj (1/259, 264) where he cited them accepting them as if they were matters stipulated in Sharia! He has many examples of this manner, some of which preceded without alerting that they are from him, and we will mention a large part of them in the specific book on innovations if Allah the Exalted wills. One might wonder at that given that his book is a great source in stipulating items of innovation, and this chapter with which I ended the book is a just witness to that. But if you knew that he was a follower of others in his knowledge, and influenced to a large extent by the schools of Sufism and their nonsense, the wonder leaves you and you increase in certainty of the correctness of Malik's saying: (There is none among us but he rejects and is rejected, except the owner of this grave), peace be upon him.",
