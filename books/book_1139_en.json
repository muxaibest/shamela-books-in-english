Al-Hasan said, 'That I cut my dry bread and eat it is dearer to me than wearing a silken jubbah.' 5 - Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Jabir Al-Hajari told us, Ishaq bin Ahmad bin Ja'far Al-Qattan told us, Abu Said Al-Ashajj told us, Isa bin Yunus told us, Al-Ala bin Al-Mughira Al-Bundar told us, saying: Al-Hasan was informed of the death of Al-Hajjaj, so he prostrated.
