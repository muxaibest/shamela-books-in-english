Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Biruni was one of the major scholars of the fourth and fifth Hijri centuries. He was born on the 2nd of Dhu al-Hijjah in the year 362 AH in a region called Birun, a dependency of Khwarazm [Khwarazm, Uzbekistan/Turkmenistan], hence he was nicknamed Al-Biruni. Neither his lineage, nor his father, nor his grandfather are known. He began receiving the sciences and knowledge circulating in his era thoroughly. What helped broaden the scope of his knowledge were his many travels and his overflowing yearning to acquire sciences, which began with him from a young age. From the beginning, he was interested in issues that were not customary or known among the educated in the Islamic Middle Ages. At the age of twenty, he left his homeland heading for the coasts of the Khazar Sea (Caspian Sea). He was patronized in Jurjan [Gorgan, Iran] by Qabus bin Wushmagir al-Ziyari, to whom he dedicated his first major work, 'The Remaining Signs' (Al-Athar al-Baqiyah). He also had correspondence with Ibn Sina, who was his contemporary. In the year 400 AH, he returned to his homeland, but soon sedition and tribulations stormed through it. When Mahmoud al-Ghaznawi came to occupy Khwarazm in the year 408 AH, he drove some of those therein as captives, including Al-Biruni. Thus, this scholar ended up in Ghazna [Ghazni, Afghanistan], the capital of Mahmoud in Afghanistan. However, Al-Biruni was not a man to rest or let calamities hinder him from his tasks; he began writing while he was on his way to captivity. Among what he wrote at this time was his book known as 'Verification of What is Said About India' (Tahqiq ma li-l-Hind). The name of Al-Biruni became famous in Arabic records in the field of geography and tourism, but what appears from his works is that he was not just a geographer; more accurately, he was an author of extremely vast knowledge, more than just being a geographical scholar. Indeed, the circle of his information was so wide that determining the number of sciences he did not know is easier than the sciences he concerned himself with. Most of his interests and scientific activities revolved around mathematics, astronomy, and related sciences; therefore, his interest in the field of geography was directed towards the mathematical and astronomical aspects of it. His Works: He has several compositions, including: 'Determination of the Coordinates of Positions for the Correction of Distances between Cities' (Tahdid al-Amakin), 'The Mas'udic Canon' (Al-Qanun al-Mas'udi), 'The Remaining Signs' (Al-Athar al-Baqiyah), 'Pharmacy in Medicine' (Al-Saydanah fi al-Tibb), 'Verification of What is Said About India' (Tahqiq ma li-l-Hind), and others.",

    "text": "Preface. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. When I began writing the introduction to this book, I thought the matter would be easy. But when I entered the world of Al-Biruni, I found him to be a genius and a raging, surging sea; you stand on its shore unable to perceive its extent, you dive into it unable to fathom its depths, and it enchants you so you cannot return. You seek help from the contradictions written about him in the dates of his news, and thus you become his captive. You will not know his news, attributes, and personality unless you read him and select what you wish from his works. This book, 'The History of India', or 'Verification of What is Said About India, Accepted by Reason or Rejected', is considered a complete, fundamental reference for Indian civilization. He left nothing without writing about it. The orientalist Buhler says about this book: \"He wrote it... viewing with the mind of a philosopher and mathematician familiar with the research methods of Aristotle, Plato, Ptolemy, and Galen...\" Al-Biruni admits: \"The entrances into it exhausted me, despite the eagerness that I uniquely possessed in my days.\" Al-Biruni intended the book 'History of India' to be for every Muslim wishing to debate with the Indians, so it would be a dialogue of equals. His Name, Title, and Birth: Al-Biruni was born on September 4, 973 AD, near Kath [Kath, Uzbekistan] (also called Kat). It is said that neither his lineage, nor his father, nor his grandfather is known. As for the Persian word 'Birun', it means 'the near one or the outsider'. Which...",

Perhaps that was due to his family's frequent traveling as merchants, or because they resided outside the city walls to avoid paying taxes. His Teacher: It was Al-Biruni's good fortune that his teacher was the famous astronomer Abu Nasr Mansur bin Ali bin Iraq (a student of Abu al-Wafa), who noticed his genius and trained him, and great affection and trust developed between them. His Life and Era: Al-Biruni grew up in Khwarazm [Khwarazm region]. We will mention a little about the history of this region and the characteristics of its people. When rule stabilized for the Umayyads, Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf in the year 704 (suggested to) the governor of Khurasan residing in Merv [Merv, Turkmenistan], the commander Qutayba bin Muslim, to cross the 'Amu Darya' river [Amu Darya] (Jayhun at the time) and conquer the lands beyond this river, where the armies of Uthman bin Affan had stopped. This river separated Persian-speaking nationalities from Turkic-speaking peoples (Turkmen). After magnificent operations lasting 8 years, Qutayba subjugated the northeastern regions (Bukhara [Bukhara, Uzbekistan], Tashkent [Tashkent, Uzbekistan], and Samarkand [Samarkand, Uzbekistan]) as well as the northwestern region (Khwarazm). Qutayba destroyed many idols and temples. This conquest brought praiseworthy consequences as it paved the way for the growth of great scientific and cultural centers that contributed to the progress of world civilization represented at that time by the Arabs. The reader may recall that geniuses before Al-Zamakhshari and Al-Khwarizmi were born in Khwarazm, and likewise Al-Biruni. Between the Sea of Khwarazm (Aral Sea) and the Caspian Sea to the west, Al-Biruni lived the first half of his life. Two cities were famous in Khwarazm at that time: Kath and Al-Jurjaniyah to the north; both of them...",

Yaqut says about Khwarazm: Its people are scholars, jurists, intelligent, and wealthy. It is, by my life, a good land. They possess endurance and strength; tallness and bulkiness prevail among them, their heads are broad, and they have wide foreheads. They are accustomed to contentment with little (and the wealthy are like the poor), and we also deduce that they have a strong attachment to their homeland. Al-Maqrizi «1» also tells us: Al-Jurjaniyah is an amazing city, for all its people are soldiers, even the grocer, the butcher, the baker, and the weaver. Its people are people of precise crafts. The practice of theology (Kalam) prevails among them in the markets and alleys; they debate without fanaticism and denounce it from anyone, saying: (You have nothing but victory through argument/proof). Al-Biruni also lived in Jurjan [Gorgan, Iran] on the Caspian Sea, which is (a beautiful city on a great valley, with plains, mountains, sea, immense valleys, and high mountains; if the hunter goes out in the morning, he returns with what he desires). Al-Biruni spent a large period of his life in Ghazni [Ghazni, Afghanistan]. Al-Biruni's era was a dark era due to the sedition that ignited within it, yet it astounds with the scholars it gathered. Here is Ibn Yunus (died 1009), the genius of astronomy and trigonometry who invented the spherical pendulum and used it as a measure of time. And there is Ibn al-Haytham, the genius of mathematics and physics who developed the science of optics and lenses. And there is Ali bin Isa, the most famous surgeon and author in the field of vision and eyes. And let us not forget the philosopher-physician Ibn Sina. These are but a few of the scholars of the East. The historian Sarton, who evaluated the civilizations of nations and enumerated their achievements in his massive book 'Introduction to the History of Science', says that the first half of the eleventh century should...",

As for the political aspect of Al-Biruni's era, it was a stage of humiliation and dissolution for the Abbasid Caliphate. There is no doubt about his displacement and flight from the sedition that struck (Kath) when the governor of Al-Jurjaniyah, the second and large city in Khwarazm, invaded and besieged it, annexing Kath and its surroundings to his authority. Al-Biruni was supporting the governor of his town, so he fled. Al-Biruni says in his book 'The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries' (Al-Athar al-Baqiyah) that he took refuge in Rayy [Rayy/Tehran, Iran] and was in misery and abject poverty, which incited the mockery of an astrologer against him. However, they became friends after that, then the Buyid Prince Fakhr al-Dawla invited him, so he built a large sundial for him on a mountain overlooking Rayy and named it after the Prince. During this period, he worked in many regions around the Caspian Sea. When Muhammad bin Ma'mun, from whom Al-Biruni had fled, died and was succeeded by his son Ali, political conditions and personal animosities had calmed down. So Ali invited him to return to Khwarazm, and he returned due to what we know of Al-Biruni's attachment to his region and his acceptance of Ali's invitation, who attached him to the entourage of his brother, Prince Ibn al-Abbas Ma'mun. After Al-Biruni left Qabus, sedition stormed Jurjan and claimed Qabus's life within a few years. After Ali's death around the year 1009, he was succeeded by Abu al-Abbas, who increased Al-Biruni's burdens by appointing him as a resident political advisor in the palace and a respected ambassador due to the soundness of his mind, the eloquence of his tongue, and the strength of his arguments in persuasion. Al-Biruni speaks with complaint because his observations were affected and his work in the assembly of sciences diminished, saying in the book 'Tahdid...'

However, his preoccupations did not dissuade him from finishing what he started in the year 995 regarding measurements of the sun's altitude, especially since his benefactor granted him money to construct a device to observe the solar apogee. He performed this between June 7 and December 7 of the year 1016. In this prosperous period, he designed a 'hemisphere' with a diameter of 5 meters to be a device showing solutions via graphical lines for problems related to geodesy and measuring its properties, such as area, for example. But sedition refused but to sabotage his work; a sedition erupted in which Ma'mun fell victim, and as Al-Biruni says: 'Its consequences resulted in a security that did not allow for returning to the former state and occupying oneself with what represents the highest priority...' Thereupon, Mahmoud al-Ghaznawi took revenge for his covenant and occupied Khwarazm on July 3, 1017. He drove those in the court as captives, including Al-Biruni, in the spring of 1018. Thus, this scholar ended up in Ghazna [Ghazni, Afghanistan], the capital of Mahmoud in Afghanistan. But Al-Biruni was not a man to rest or let calamities hinder him from his tasks; he began writing while he was on his way to captivity. After Mahmoud's death in 1030, he was succeeded by his son Mas'ud, who overcame his brother. Al-Biruni's material conditions improved, and his freedom increased, so he was able to visit his country in the years 1032 and 1034. This period was distinguished by an abundance of authorship in various fields. His Works: In the year 1036, he finished a catalogue of his works up to that date, so it would not be confusing to anyone. He says in the language of one confident and certain of the importance of his works: 'You should know regarding what I have enumerated of my books, including what I did in my youth, and my knowledge of its art increased after that, yet I did not discard it or deem it base, for they are all my sons, and the most constitute the son and his enchanting poetry.' Then he lists the names of the books 'which happened for me to do by the year 427 AH, when my age reached 65 lunar years and 63 solar years.' You know that he wrote 180 works or more; we will summarize the discussion on some of them. 'The Book of the Determination of Coordinates of Positions for the Correction of Distances between Cities' (Kitab Tahdid al-Amakin...), he finished composing it on 28...",

    "text": "...August 1025. The book is a valuable volume for measuring longitude and latitude and the location of countries on the globe. 'The Mas'udic Canon' (Kitab al-Qanun al-Mas'udi) is a massive encyclopedia summarizing Al-Biruni's rules and innovations; within the encyclopedia is a large treasury of the history of nations and their calendars from the 'Day of Adam' to the day of Al-Biruni, so let whoever wishes consult it. His Death: In the year 1040, Mas'ud's commanders revolted and slaughtered the Prince. He was succeeded by his son (Mawdud), to whom he presented his last work, 'Pharmacy in Medicine' (Al-Saydanah fi al-Tibb). In this book, he mentions that he exceeded eighty years and his hearing and sight had weakened. His news diminishes after the year 1048, but what is certain from his words in the book 'Pharmacy in Medicine' is that he was alive that year, and perhaps he died around 1050. Some of His Feats: He possessed determination that made him perform calculations and solve equations that are not handled today except by electronic brains. He chose the most difficult problems and solved them; these geometric and mathematical problems are called 'Al-Biruni's problems'. He presented a simple method for drawing geometric shapes of third-dimension tools, like spherical bodies, on paper. Among his most important astronomical works is his invention of a special theory for estimating the 'approximate ratio' (Pi) necessary for calculating the areas and circumferences of circles. He managed to estimate the circumference of the Earth and its diameter. Al-Biruni found the value of the approximate ratio to be 3.14174, and the correct one is 3.14159. He is, therefore, the inventor of the rule known as Al-Biruni's Rule, which is a mathematical equation used to calculate the Earth's radius based on knowing its circumference. The equation is simple, like all great rules... Nallino says: '...Al-Biruni's equation for measuring the Earth's circumference is one of the glorious, transmitted scientific works.' He designed a simple device for measuring...",

He says that gold was named so (Dhahab) 'because it is quick to leave (Dhahab) and slow to return to its owners!' He is the first to use the unit (ratio of one) for the known ratios in trigonometry, and this usage exists to this day. His works, with few exceptions, possess a clear style with no ambiguity or obscurity, even if not smooth. He loves brevity, so he says he writes '...for he who has knowledge and diligence, and loves science... and whoever is not of this description, I do not care if he understands or does not understand.' The West Resurrects Him: The orientalist Nicholas de Khanikoff was the first to alert Europe to Al-Biruni in 1866. Soon books flowed: 'Al-Biruni's Trigonometry', 'Al-Biruni's Geography'. Among the greatest editors was the German Sachau, who translated into German and English two massive books ('The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries' in 1879 and 'The History of India' in 1888). Sachau says: '...Al-Biruni is the greatest intellect that appeared in history...' After experts reviewed his books on India, one of them said: '...a unique attempt by a believing man studying with integrity and detachment a pagan civilization... from a historical perspective, this study became the greatest scientific phenomenon in the history of Islam... and everything written before is like children's games...' Therefore, the Indians became interested in Al-Biruni, and in 1913 a mission was established to collect his works, and likewise the Persians.

The saying of the speaker, 'Hearsay is not like eye-witnessing,' is indeed true because eye-witnessing is the perception by the eye of the beholder of the beheld at the time of its existence and in the place of its occurrence. Were it not for the afflictions attached to reports, their virtue would surpass eye-witnessing and viewing due to the latter's limitation to existence which does not exceed the moments of time, while reports encompass that, what came before it of past times, and what comes after it of future times, such that the report covers both the existent and the nonexistent together. Writing is a type of it (reporting) that is almost nobler than others; for where would we get knowledge of the news of nations were it not for the enduring traces of the pen? Furthermore, the report about a possible existent thing, in customary practice, corresponds to truth and falsehood in a single form. Both are attached to it from the side of the reporters due to the disparity of intentions and the prevalence of conflict and dispute among nations. For there is a reporter of a false matter who intends thereby himself, aggrandizing his kind because it is under him; or he intends it to disparage the opposite of his kind because of his success in it through his will. It is known that both of these are from the motives of blameworthy desire and anger. And there is a reporter of falsehood regarding a class he loves out of gratitude, or hates out of resentment, and this is close to the first, for the motive for his action is from the motives of love and overcoming. And there is a reporter of it drawing near to a benefit due to baseness of nature, or...",

And there is a reporter of it by nature, as if he is compelled to it, unable to do otherwise, and that is from the motives of wickedness and the evil of the hidden parts of nature. And there is a reporter of it out of ignorance; he is the imitator of reporters, even if they are many in total or sequential group after group. He is a delusion of intermediaries between the listener and the first intentional one. If they are dropped from the middle, that first one remains one of those we enumerated as fabricators. The one who avoids lying and adheres to truth is praised and commended even by the liar, let alone others. It has been said: 'Speak the truth even if against yourselves.' And the Messiah, peace be upon him, said in the Gospel what means this: 'Do not mind the assault of kings in speaking the truth before them, for they own nothing of you but the body, but as for the soul, they have no hand over it.' This from him is a command for true courage. For the character that the common people think is courage—when they see advancement into battles and recklessness in entering perils—is a type of it. But its highest genus over its types is the disdain for death, whether it be in speech or in action. And just as justice is pleasing in natures, loved for itself, desired for its beauty, likewise is truthfulness, except for one who has not tasted its sweetness or knew it but avoided it, like the one asked among those known for lying: 'Have you ever told the truth?' His answer: 'Were it not that I fear speaking the truth, I would have said no.' For he is the deviator from justice, the preferring of tyranny, false testimony, betrayal of trust, usurpation of properties by fraud and theft, and all else by which the corruption of the world and creation occurs. I had found the Master Abu Sahl Abd al-Mun'im bin Ali bin Nuh al-Tiflisi [Tbilisi, Georgia], may Allah support him, finding ugly the intent of the narrator in his book about the Mu'tazilites to disparage them in their saying: 'Allah the Almighty is Knowing by His Essence.'

    "text": "...so I informed him that this is a method from which he who intends to narrate about dissenters and adversaries is rarely free. Furthermore, it is more apparent regarding schools of thought that are united by one religion and creed due to their proximity and mixing, and more hidden regarding separate religions, especially those that do not share a root or branch, due to their distance and the obscurity of the path to knowing them. What is available to us of books on sects and what has been produced on opinions and religions contains nothing but the likes of this. Whoever does not know the reality of the matter regarding them scoops from them what does not benefit him with their people except shame if virtue shakes his shoulder, or persistence and obstinacy if vice slackens in him. Whoever knows the reality of the matter, his utmost affair is to treat them as evening tales and myths, listening to them for distraction and amusement, not for believing them and conviction. The example in the content of the speech fell upon the religions of India and their schools of thought. I pointed out that most of what is written in books is attributed falsely, and some of it is copied from others, gathered and mixed, not refined according to their opinion nor pruned. I did not find among the authors of books on sects anyone who intended bare narration without bias or sycophancy except Abu al-Abbas al-Iranshahri, if he was not involved in any of the religions but rather unique in an invention of his own to which he invited. He did well in narrating what the Jews and Christians are upon and what the Torah and Gospel contain, and he was thorough in mentioning Manichaeism and what is in their books regarding the news of extinct sects. But when he reached the sect of India and the Shamaniyya (Buddhists/Sramanas), his arrow missed the target, and he swerved at the end to the book of Zarqan, copying what was in it into his book. What he did not copy from it, it is as if it was heard from the commoners of these two groups. When the Master, may Allah support him, re-examined the books and found the matter in them as described, he was eager for the editing of what I knew from their side to be an aid for whoever wanted to refute them and a treasure for whoever sought to interact with them. He asked for that, so I did it, not slandering the adversary nor refraining from narrating his speech even if it diverged from the truth and its hearing was atrocious to its people (Muslims), for it is his belief and he is more insightful about it. The book is not a book of argumentation and debate such that I would use in it...",

Rather, it is a book of narration, so I have presented the speech of the Indians as it is, and I have added to it what the Greeks have of the like, to define the closeness between them. For their philosophers, even if they strove for verification, did not exit, in what connects to their common people, from the symbols of their creed and the postulates of their law. I do not mention with their speech the speech of others, unless it is for the Sufis or one of the sects of the Christians, due to the closeness of the matter between all of them regarding incarnation and union. I had translated into Arabic two books: one of them on the principles and the description of existing things, named \"Sank\" [Samkhya], and the other on the liberation of the soul from the fetters of the body, known as \"Patanjal\" [Patanjali/Yoga Sutras]. In them are most of the foundations upon which the orbit of their belief revolves, excluding the branches of their laws.

Either the matter will become easy by knowing them, or the excuse for it will be paved. That is because separation hides what connection reveals, and for it, between us, there are causes: Among them is that the people differ from us in everything that nations share, and the first of it is the language. Even if nations differ by the like of it, when one seeks it to remove the difference, that is not easy because it is in itself long and wide, resembling Arabic. One thing in it is named by several names, original and derived, and one name applies to several named things, necessitating, in objectives, an increase of descriptions, as no one distinguishes between them except one with intelligence for the placement of speech and the analogy of meaning backwards and forwards. They take pride in that, just as others take pride in it, while in reality, it is a defect in the language. Then it is divided into a vulgar one from which no one benefits except the commoners, and a guarded eloquent one that relates to inflections, etymology, and the subtleties of grammar and rhetoric, to which no one returns except the skilled scholars. Then it is composed of letters, some of which do not match the letters of Arabic and Persian, nor do they resemble them. Rather, our tongues and uvulas hardly submit to producing them according to the reality of their outlets, nor do our ears hear them with distinction from their counterparts and likenesses, nor do our hands in writing [succeed] in imitating them. Thus, it becomes difficult to establish anything of their language in our script due to what we are compelled to of artifices to record it by changing points and signs and restricting it with diacritics that are either famous or devised. This is alongside the lack of care of the copyists for it and their lack of concern for correction and collation, until the effort is lost...",

It suffices you as a notification that we might pick up a name from their mouths and strive to authenticate it, then if we repeated it to them, they would hardly recognize it except with effort. In their language, as in other languages of the non-Arabs, two quiescent letters and three combine, which is what our companions call moving with a hidden vowel. It is difficult for us to utter most of their words and names because they begin with quiescent letters. Their books in the sciences, along with that, are arranged in types of meter according to their taste. They intended by that their preservation in their state and estimation, and the quick appearance of corruption in them when addition and deletion occur, so that memorization becomes easy, for their reliance is on it rather than the written. It is known that poetry is not free from a mixture of affectation to equalize the meters, correct the breakage, and mend the deficiency, and it necessitates the multiplication of phrases, which is one of the causes for the instability of names regarding their named objects. So this is one of the causes that make it difficult to understand what they have. Among them is that they differ from us in religion, a total difference. Nothing of acknowledgment of what they have occurs from us, nor [do they acknowledge] anything of what we have. Despite the lack of dispute in the majority of sects among them except for argumentation and speech without harming «1» the soul or body or condition, they are not on this path with those other than them. They call them \"Malij\" [Mleccha], which is the impure. They do not permit mixing with him in marriage and kinship, or sitting and eating and drinking, due to impurity. They deem impure what his water and fire have touched, and upon these two is the orbit of livelihood. Then there is no hope for correcting that by a trick, just as the impure is purified by moving to the state of purity, for it is not permitted for them to accept one who is not of them if he desires them or inclines to their religion. This is among what breaks every connection and necessitates the most severe separation. Among them is that they differ from us in customs and habits, until they almost frighten their children with us, our dress, and our appearances. They attribute devilry to us, and to it [they attribute] the opposite of what is obligatory, even though this attribution is absolute for us and common between us and indeed between nations in their entirety. My knowledge of some of them is that he resents us because one of their kings perished at the hands of an enemy...",

    "text": "...of his who sought him from our land and left a fetus. He became king after him and was named \"Sabkar\" «1». When he matured, he asked his mother about the condition of his father, so she told him the story. He became angry about it and went out from his land to the land of the enemy and exacted his share from the nations until he became weary of slaughter and inflicting damage. So he compelled the survivors to this dressing in our dress as a humiliation for them and a punishment. She thanked his deed when she heard it, as he did not brand us with becoming Indian and moving to their customs. What increased the aversion and difference is that the sect known as the Shamaniyya [Buddhists], despite the intensity of hatred from them towards the Brahmins, are closer to the Indians than others. Khurasan, Fars [Iran], Iraq [Iraq], and Mosul [Iraq] up to the borders of al-Sham [Syria] were in ancient times upon their religion until Zoroaster appeared from Azerbaijan [Azerbaijan] and called to Magianism [Zoroastrianism] in Balkh [Balkh, Afghanistan]. His call gained currency «2» with Gushtasp, and his son Isfandiyar undertook spreading it in the lands of the East and the West by force and by peace. He erected Fire Temples from China [China] to Rum [Byzantium]. Then the kings after him purified Fars and Iraq for their creed, so the \"Shamaniyya\" departed from it to the east of Balkh. The Magians remain until now in the land of India and are called there \"Mag\" [Maga Brahmins]. This was the beginning of the aversion from the side of Khurasan among them, until Islam came and the state of the Persians went. The raiding of their land increased their estrangement when Muhammad bin al-Qasim bin al-Munabbih entered the land of Sindh [Pakistan] from the regions of Sijistan [Sistan, Iran/Afghanistan] and conquered the city of \"Bamhanwa\" and named it \"Mansura\" [near Shahdadpur, Pakistan], and the city of \"Mulistan\" and named it \"Ma'mura\" [Multan, Pakistan]. He penetrated deep into the lands of India to the city of \"Kannauj\" [Kannauj, India] and trod the land of al-Qandahar [Gandhara, Pakistan/Afghanistan] and the borders of Kashmir [Kashmir, India/Pakistan], returning, fighting at times and making peace at others, and leaving the people upon their creed except for those who were satisfied with transfer «3» from it. This planted grudges in their hearts, even if no one of the raiders crossed the borders of Kabul [Kabul, Afghanistan] and the water of the Sindh [Indus River] after him until the days of the Turks, when they took possession in Ghazna [Ghazni, Afghanistan] in the days of the Samanids. The state fell to Nasir al-Din Subuktigin, so he preferred raiding and titled himself with it. He paved for those after him the paths in weakening the side of India, which Yamin al-Dawla Mahmud [of Ghazni], may Allah have mercy on them both, treaded for thirty odd years. He annihilated their greenery (prosperity) and performed wonders in...",

Rather, that was the cause of the erasure of their sciences from the conquered borders and their departure to where the hand does not reach yet, such as Kashmir [Kashmir, India/Pakistan] and Banarasi [Varanasi, India] and their likes, along with the strengthening of the separation in them from all foreigners by the requirement of politics and religion. After that, there are causes he mentioned like defamation of them, but they are evident «2» in their morals, not hidden. Foolishness is a disease that has no cure. That is because they believe regarding the earth that it is their earth, and regarding people that they are their race, and regarding kings that they are their leaders, and regarding religion that it is their creed, and regarding science that it is what they have. They become haughty, arrogant «3», and impressed with themselves, so they are ignorant. In their nature is stinginess with what they know and excessive guarding of it from those not worthy of it among them, so how about from others? Furthermore, they do not think that there are other than their countries on earth, or other than their inhabitants among people, or that creation has knowledge other than theirs. Such that if they were told of knowledge or a scholar in Khurasan and Fars [Iran], they would deem the informant ignorant and would not believe him due to the mentioned affliction. If they had traveled and mixed with others, they would have returned from their opinion. However, their ancients were not of this degree of negligence. Thus, \"Barahmihir\" [Varahamihira], one of their virtuous ones, when he commands the honoring of the Brahmins, says: \"Indeed the Greeks, even if they are impure, when they graduated in the sciences and excelled «4» in them over others, honoring them became obligatory. So what might we say about the Brahmin if he gathers the honor of knowledge to his purity?\" They used to acknowledge to the Greeks that what they were given of knowledge was weightier than their share of it. It suffices you as a proof of it from one who praises himself while he greets you: I used to stand before their astrologers in the position of the student to the master due to my foreignness among them and my falling short of what they are in of their conventions. When I was guided a little to them, I began to stop them on the causes and point to something of the proofs and hint to them the true methods in calculations. So they flocked to me...",

They almost attributed me to sorcery, and they did not describe me to their elders in their language except as the Sea [Bahr/Sagara], and water turns sour until vinegar becomes scarce «1». This is the picture of the situation. The entries into it have exhausted me, despite my eagerness in which I was unique in my days, and my spending of what was possible without being stingy on it in collecting their books from the presumed places, and summoning those who are guided to them from the hiding places. Who else «2» has the like of that, except one who is provided from the success of Allah what I was denied in ability for movements, in which I was incapacitated from «3» grasping and spreading in commanding and forbidding; its side was folded away from me. Thanks be to Allah for what sufficed of it. I say: Indeed the Greeks in the days of Ignorance (Jahiliyyah) before the appearance of Christianity were upon the like of what the Indians are upon of belief. Their elite in speculation is close to their elite, and their commoners in the worship of idols are like their commoners. For this reason, I cite the speech of some of them regarding others due to the agreement and the closeness of the two matters, not for correction, for what is other than the Truth is deviating, and disbelief is one creed because of the deviation from it. However, the Greeks were successful with the philosophers who were in their region, until they refined for them the special principles excluding the general ones, because the utmost of the elite is following research and speculation, and the utmost of the commoners is recklessness and stubbornness if they are free from fear and awe. Socrates indicates that when he opposed the general populace of his people in the worship of idols and deviated from naming the stars \"gods\" in his utterance. How the eleven judges of the people of Athens agreed on the verdict to kill him without the twelfth, until he fulfilled his vow (died) not returning from the truth. The Indians did not have the likes of them who refined the sciences. So you hardly find for them a special speech for that except in the utmost disorder and bad arrangement, and mixed at its end with the superstitions of the commoners of multiplying the number and extending the periods and of the postulates of the creed in which its people find opposition atrocious.

Let us present something of their books on that so that our narration is not like a mere heard thing.

So their speech and their benefiting are in time. Since divine matters have no connection with time, Allah, Glory be to Him, is Knowing, Speaking in eternity. He is the one who spoke to 'Brahm' [Brahma] and others of the ancients in various ways. Among them is one to whom He cast a book, and among them is one to whom He opened a door to a mediator, and among them is one to whom He revealed, so he attained by thought what He poured upon him.\" The questioner said: \"So from where does He have this knowledge?\" The answerer said: \"His knowledge is in its state in eternity. Since He was never ignorant, His essence is knowing; He did not acquire knowledge He did not have.\" As He said in the \"Bed\" [Veda] which He revealed to Brahm: \"Praise and extol Him who spoke the Veda and was before the Veda.\" The questioner said: \"How do you worship One whom sensation does not perceive?\" The answerer said: \"His naming establishes His I-ness (existence), for news is only about a thing, and the name is only for a named. Even if He is absent from the senses so they did not perceive Him, the soul has intellect of Him and thought has encompassed His attributes. This is His pure worship, and by persisting in it, happiness is attained.\" This is their speech in this famous book. And in the book \"Gita\" [Bhagavad Gita], which is a part of the book \"Bharat\" [Mahabharata], in what transpired between \"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva/Krishna] «1» and \"Arjun\" [Arjuna]: \"I am the All without a beginning by birth or «2» an end by death. I do not intend by my action a reward, nor am I particular to a class over another for friendship or enmity. I have given each of my creation his need in his action. So whoever knows me by this attribute and imitates me in distancing greed from work, his bond is untied and his salvation and liberation become easy.\" This is as was said in the definition of philosophy: It is imitating Allah as much as possible.

Among them are those who did not go beyond the sensibles regarding Him. And among them are those who, when they went beyond them, stopped at the natural things. They did not know that above them is One who did not beget and was not begotten, and the knowledge of no one has encompassed other than «1» His I-ness, while He encompasses everything in knowledge.\" The speech of the Indians differs regarding the meaning of action. Whoever attributes it to Him, it is from the perspective of the more general cause, because since the subsistence of the agents is «2» by Him, He is the cause of their action, so it is His action through their mediation. And whoever attributes it to other than Him, it is from the perspective of the lower existence. In the book \"Sank\" [Samkhya], the ascetic said: \"Is there a difference regarding the action and the agent or not?\" The sage said: \"A group has said that the Soul [Purusha] is not active and Matter is not living, so Allah the Self-Sufficient is the one who joins them and separates; so He is the Agent, and the action occurs from His side by moving them just as the capable living moves the incapable dead.\" Others said: \"Their meeting is by nature, for thus the custom has run in every decaying growing thing.\" Others said: \"The agent is the Soul because in the 'Bed' [Veda] is that every existent is from 'Purush' [Purusha].\" Others said: \"The agent is Time, for the world is tied to it like the tying of a sheep with a rope fastened to it, so that its movement is according to its attraction and relaxation.\" Others said: \"Action is nothing but the reward for the preceding work.\" All these opinions are deviating from the correct. The truth in it is that all action belongs to Matter [Prakriti], because it is the one that binds, circulates in forms, and releases. So it is the Agent, and all that is beneath it are helpers to it in completing the action. Due to the Soul's emptiness of different powers, it is not active. This is the saying of their elite regarding Allah the Exalted, and they call Him \"Ishfar\" [Ishvara], meaning the Self-Sufficient Generous who gives and does not take, because they saw His unity as the pure one, and the unity of what is other than Him in any way is multiplied. They saw His existence as real because the subsistence of existents is by Him. It is not impossible to imagine 'is not' in them with 'is' [Ays/Being] «3» in Him, just as it is impossible to imagine 'is not' in Him with 'is' in them.

An example is that some of their elite call Allah the Exalted a \"Point\" to absolve Him by it from the attributes of bodies. Then their commoner reads that and thinks that he magnified Him by dimunition, and his understanding does not reach with it to the verification of the point. So he crosses from the ugliness of anthropomorphism and limitation by magnification to his saying: He is twelve fingers long in a width of ten fingers—Exalted is He above limitation and numbering. And like what we narrated of His encompassing of the whole so that no hidden thing is hidden from Him, so their commoner thinks that encompassing is by sight, and sight is by the eye, and two eyes are better than one-eyedness, so he describes Him with a thousand eyes as an expression of the perfection of knowledge. The likes of these hideous superstitions exist among them, especially in the classes for whom engaging in knowledge is not permitted, as the mention of them will come in its place.",

There were among them those who held that all things are one thing. Then [there were] those who spoke in that of latency (Kumun), and those of potentiality (Quwwah), and that man, for example, is not superior to the stone and the inanimate object except by proximity to the First Cause in rank, otherwise he is it. And among them were those who saw real existence for the First Cause only, due to Its self-sufficiency in it and the need of other than It for It; and that whatever is in need of another for existence, its existence is like imagination, not real, and the Real is the First One only. This is the opinion of the Sufiyya [Sufis], and they are the sages (Hukama), for \"Sof\" in Greek is wisdom, and by it the philosopher is named \"Pilasopa\" [Philosophos], meaning lover of wisdom. When a group in Islam went to something close to their opinion, they were named by their name, but some did not know the title, so they attributed them for reliance (Tawakkul) to the \"Suffah\" (bench/ledge) and that they were its companions in the era of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Then it was misspelled after that and made from \"Suf\" (wool) of goats. Abu al-Fath al-Busti turned away from that, the best turning away, in his saying:",

    "text": "People disputed about the Sufi and differed ... of old, and thought it derived from al-Suf (wool).\nI do not attribute this name to other than a youth ... who is pure (Safi), so he is Sufi, until he was titled the Sufi.\nLikewise, they went to the view that the Existent is one thing, and that the First Cause appears in it in different forms and Its power settles in parts of it in divergent states necessitating difference along with union. There were among them those who said: Indeed the one who turns completely to the First Cause, imitating It to the limit of his possibility, unites with It upon abandoning intermediaries and shedding attachments and hindrances. These are opinions the Sufis go to due to the similarity of the subject. They used to see in souls and spirits that they are subsisting by themselves before incarnation in bodies, numbered and marshaled, recognizing each other and denying each other; and that they acquire in bodies, by choice, what they attain by it, after separating from bodies, the power over the disposals of the world. Therefore, they called them \"gods\" (Alihah) and built temples in their names and offered sacrifices to them. As Galen says in the book \"Exhortation to Learning the Arts\": The virtuous among people only merited the honor they attained until they joined the deified ones (Mutallihin) because of the excellence of their treatment of the arts, not by athleticism, wrestling, and throwing the ball. Of that is that \"Asqalibius\" [Asclepius] and \"Diyonusius\" [Dionysus], whether they were in the past two humans then they became deified, or they were from the beginning of their affair deified, indeed they only merited the greatest honor because one of them taught people medicine and the other taught them the art of vineyards. Galen said in his commentary on the Covenants of Hippocrates: As for the sacrifices in the name of \"Asqalibius,\" we have never heard that anyone offered a goat to him, because the spinning of its hair is not easy and increasing its meat causes epilepsy due to the badness of its chyme. Rather, they offer roosters as \"Abuqrat\" [Hippocrates] «1» offered them, for this divine man acquired for people the art of medicine, and it is better than what \"Diyonusius\" extracted, meaning wine, and \"Dhimitar\" [Demeter], meaning the grains from which bread is taken; therefore grains are named by the name of this «2» [goddess], and the vine tree by the name of this [god].

    "text": "...Plato in \"Timaeus\": \"The gods whom the Hanifs (pagans) name 'gods' because they do not die, and they name Allah the 'First God', are the angels.\" Then he said: \"Indeed Allah said to the gods, 'You are not in yourselves other than capable of corruption at all. Rather, you will not corrupt by death because you attained from My will, at the time of My originating you, the firmest knot'.\" And he said in it in another place: \"Allah is by the singular number, not gods by the multiplied number.\" So according to them, based on what appears from their sayings, the name of gods applies from the perspective of generality to every majestic, noble thing. This is found likewise among many nations, until they cross «1» with it to mountains and seas and the likes. And it applies from the perspective of specificity to the First Cause, to the angels, to their souls «2», and to another type which Plato calls \"al-Sakinat\" (Sekina/Divine Presence?), and the expression of the translators did not reach a complete definition of it, so we received from it the name without the meaning. Yahya al-Nahwi [John Philoponus] said in his refutation of \"Abruqlus\" [Proclus]: \"The Greeks used to apply the name of 'gods' to the sensed bodies in the sky, as do many of the non-Arabs. Then when they thought about the intelligible substances, they applied this name to them.\" So by necessity, it is known that the meaning of deification returns to what is held regarding the angels. That is in the explicit speech of Galen in that book: \"If the matter is true that 'Asqalibius' was in the past a human, then Allah qualified him because He made him an angel of the angels, then what is other than that is delirium.\" And in another place in it, he says: \"Indeed Allah said to 'Luvarghus' [Lycurgus] «3», 'I am at your door between two matters: between naming you a human and naming you an angel, and to this I incline regarding you'.\" However, among words are those which are ugly in one religion but not another, and allowed «4» by one language and refused «5» by another. Among them is the word of deification (Ta'alluh) in the religion of Islam, for if we consider it in the language of the Arabs, we find all names by which the Pure Truth is named applicable...",

If we contemplate it in Hebrew and Syriac, the two [languages] in which are the books revealed before the Qur'an, we find \"al-Rabb\" (The Lord) in the Torah and what follows it of the books of the prophets counted in its whole parallel to \"Allah\" in Arabic, not applied to anyone by annexation like 'lord of the house' and 'lord of wealth'. And we find \"al-Ilah\" (The God) in them parallel to \"al-Rabb\" in Arabic. It was mentioned in them: Indeed the sons of \"Elohim\" came down to the daughters of men before the Flood and mixed with them. And it is mentioned in the book of \"Ayyub al-Siddiq\" [Job the Righteous]: Indeed Satan entered with the sons of \"Elohim\" to their gathering. And in the Torah of Musa [Moses], the saying of the Lord to him: \"I have made you a god to Pharaoh.\" And in the eighty-second Psalm of the Psalms of Dawud [David]: \"Indeed Allah stood in the congregation of the gods,\" meaning the angels. He named in the Torah the idols \"strange gods.\" Were it not that the Torah prohibited the worship of everything other than Allah and the prostration to idols, indeed mentioning them at all and their crossing the mind, it would have been imaginable from this word that what is commanded is the rejection of the strange gods, excluding those that are not Hebrew «1». The nations that were around the land of Palestine are those who were upon the religion of the Greeks in the worship of idols. The Children of Israel did not cease disobeying Allah by worshiping the idol \"Ba'ala\" [Baal] and the idol \"Astaruth\" [Ashtoreth] which belongs to Venus. So deification in the sense of possession (kingship) according to those people applied to the angels, and to the souls that became powerful, and by metaphor to the images made in the names of their bodies, and by figure of speech to the kings and the great ones. Likewise is the name of \"Fatherhood\" and \"Prophethood\", for Islam does not allow them, as 'Walad' (child) and 'Ibn' (son) in Arabic are close in meaning, and what is beyond the child of parents and birth is negated from the meanings of Lordship. What is other than the language of the Arabs allows for that greatly, so that the address in it by 'Father' is close to the address by 'Master'. It is known what the Christians are upon regarding that, such that he who does not speak of the Father and the Son is outside the whole of their sect. The 'Son' returns to Isa [Jesus] in the sense of specificity and preference, and it is not limited to him but goes beyond him to others. For he is the one who orders his disciples...",

He explains that by his saying in most of his speech about himself: that he is the Son of Man. The Christians are not alone on this, but the Jews share with them, for in the Book of Kings: Indeed Allah the Exalted consoled Dawud [David] regarding his son born to him from the wife of \"Uriya\" [Uriah] and promised him a son from her whom He would adopt. If it is permitted by adoption in Hebrew that Sulayman [Solomon] be a son, it is permitted that the adopter be a father. The \"Mannaniyya\" [Manichaeans] resemble the Christians among the People of the Book. Their leader \"Mani\" says in this meaning in the book \"Kanz al-Ahya\" (Treasure of the Living): Indeed the luminous hosts are called first-borns, virgins, fathers, mothers, sons, brothers, and sisters, according to what is customary in the book of the messengers. In the country of joy, there is neither male nor female, nor organs of copulation. All of them appear in living bodies and forms of divinity. They do not differ by weakness and strength, nor length and shortness, nor image and view, like lamps resembling each other lit from one lamp. The material of their food is one. The cause of that naming is only the mutual suffering «1» of the two kingdoms. When the lower dark one rose from its depth and the high luminous kingdom saw them as pairs, males and females, it formed its sons departing to war from the apparent in images like that, so it set up «2» every genus opposite its genus. The elite of the Indians refuse these descriptions, while their commoners and everyone in the branches of the creed are excessive in applying them. They transgress the mentioned measure to wife, son, daughter, pregnancy, giving birth, and other natural conditions, and they do not refrain from recklessness in mentioning them. There is no consideration for them. Their schools of thought, even if they are many, their pole is what the Brahmins are upon, and they have been candidates for its preservation and establishment. It is what we narrate. We say: They hold regarding the Existent that it is one thing, according to the like of what preceded.

He granted remembrance and knowledge and their two opposites, as is mentioned in 'Bed' [Veda].\" How similar is the saying of the author of the book \"Balinas\" [Apollonius] regarding the causes of things to this, as if it is taken from it: \"Indeed in all people is a divine power by which things are intellectually perceived by the essence and by other than the essence.\" Just as he named in Persian \"Khuda\" [God/Self-Existent] as without essence and derived for man a name from that. As for those who turn away from symbols to verification, they name the Soul \"Purush\" [Purusha], and its meaning is the Man, because it is the Living in the Existent, and they do not see other than life in it. They describe it with the alternation of knowledge and ignorance upon it, and that it is ignorant in actuality and intelligent in potentiality, accepting knowledge by acquisition, and that its ignorance is the cause of the occurrence of action and its knowledge is the cause of its cessation. Following it is Absolute Matter, meaning the Abstract Hyle (Hayula), and they call it \"Abyakt\" [Avyakta], meaning a thing without form. It is a dead thing possessing three powers in potentiality not actuality; their names are \"Sat\" [Sattva], \"Raj\" [Rajas], and \"Tam\" [Tamas]. I heard that the term of \"Buddhudan\" regarding it for his people the Shamaniyya [Buddhists] is \"Buddha Dharma «1» Sangha\", as if they are Intellect, Religion, and Ignorance. The first «2» of them is rest and goodness, from which is being and growth. The second is fatigue and hardship, from which is stability and permanence. The third is languor and blindness, from which is corruption and annihilation. Therefore, the first «3» is attributed to the angels, the second to humans, and the third to beasts. These are things in which before, after, and then occur from the perspective of rank and the narrowing of expression, not from the perspective of time. As for Matter exiting to actuality by forms and the three first powers, they call it \"Byakt\" [Vyakta], meaning the Formed. They call the sum of the Abstract Hyle and the Formed Matter \"Prakrit\" [Prakriti]. There is no benefit in this name due to our dispensing with mentioning the Absolute, and Matter suffices us in expression, for neither of them is in existence without the other.

So it is as if Nature overcomes in that transformation and dominates the transformed. It is evident that every compound has simples from which composition begins and to which analysis returns. The universal existents in the world are the Elements, and they are, in their opinion: the Sky (Ether), Wind, Fire, Water, and Earth. They are called \"Mahabhut\" [Mahabhuta], meaning the Great Natures. They do not hold regarding fire what is held regarding the hot dry body at the concavity of the Ether; rather, they mean by it this existing one on the face of the earth from the burning of smoke. In \"Baj Puran\" [Vayu Purana?]: Indeed in ancient times there were Earth, Water, Wind, and Sky. Brahm saw a spark under the earth, so he extracted it and made it into thirds. The first is \"Partib\" [Parthiva], which is the familiar fire that needs wood and water extinguishes it. The second is \"Divt\" [Divya], which is the sun. The third is \"Bidd\" [Vidyut], which is lightning. The sun attracts water, and lightning flashes through water. In the animal, there is fire in the midst of humidities, feeding on them, and they do not extinguish it. These elements are compound, so they have simples preceding them called \"Panj Matar\" [Panca Tanmatra], meaning Five Mothers. They describe them as the Five Sensibles. So the simple of Sky is \"Shabd\" [Shabda], which is the Audible. The simple of Wind is \"Spars\" [Sparsha], which is the Tangible. The simple of Fire is \"Rup\" [Rupa], which is the Visible. The simple of Water is \"Ras\" [Rasa], which is the Tasted. The simple of Earth is \"Gand\" [Gandha], which is the Smelled. Each one of these simples has what is attributed to it and all that is attributed to what is above it. So Earth has the five qualities. Water decreases from them by smell. Fire decreases from them by it and by taste. Wind by them both and by color. Sky by them and by touch. I do not know what they mean by attributing sound to the Sky. I think it is similar to what \"Omiros\" [Homer], the poet of the Greeks, said: Indeed the possessors of the seven melodies speak and respond with a beautiful voice; and he meant the seven planets. As another of the poets said: Indeed the spheres of different melodies are seven, moving forever, glorifying the Creator because He holds them, encompassing them to the farthest end of the sphere without stars. \"Furfurius\" [Porphyry] said in his book on the opinions of the virtuous philosophers regarding the nature of the sphere: Indeed the heavenly bodies, when they move in their perfected shapes and forms and their chanting of wondrous sounds, as \"Futhaghuras\" [Pythagoras] and...",

It was said: Indeed Diogenes, due to the subtlety of his sense, was singled out to hear the sound of the movement of the sphere. All of these are symbols consistent in interpretation according to the straight law. Some of those who followed them among those falling short of verification mentioned: Indeed sight is watery, smell is fiery, taste is earthy, and touch is from the spirit benefiting the whole body by contact with it. I think he only attributed sight to water due to what he heard of the humors of the eye and its layers; and smell to fire due to vapors and smoke; and taste to earth due to his food which he swallows. The four elements were exhausted, so he returned in touch to the spirit. Then we say: The result of what the counting reached is the Animal. That is because plants, according to the Indians, are a type of it, just as Plato holds that plants have sense due to what is seen in plants of the power distinguishing between the suitable and the contrary. The animal is an animal by sense. The Senses are five, called \"Indriyan\" [Indriyani], and they are hearing by the ear «1», sight by the eye, smell by the nose, taste by the tongue, and touch by the skin. Then a Will disposing them in varieties of ways; its place in him is the heart, and they named it by it \"Man\" [Manas/Mind]. Animality is completed by five necessary actions they call \"Karm Indriyan\" [Karmendriyani], meaning the Senses in Actuality (Action Senses), for the result of the former is knowledge and cognition, and from these latter is work and craft. Let us call them \"Necessities\". They are: Vocalizing varieties of needs and desires, grasping with hands for drawing and avoiding, walking with feet for seeking and fleeing, and expelling the waste of foods by both outlets prepared for it. These are twenty-five: The Universal Soul, the Abstract Hyle, the Formed Matter, the Overcoming Nature, the Simple Mothers, the Principal Elements, the Perceiving Senses, the Disposing Will, and the Instrumental Necessities. The name of the sum is \"Tattv\" [Tattva]. Knowledges are restricted to them. Therefore, \"Byas bin Barashar\" [Vyasa son of Parashara] said: Know the twenty-five by detailing, defining, and dividing, a knowledge of proof and certainty, not study by tongue.

They have claimed that the Soul in reality is ignorant of its essence and of what is beneath it of Matter, yearning to encompass what it does not know, thinking that it has no subsistence except with Matter. So it yearns for the Good, which is Permanence, and desires to view what is hidden from it, so it is stirred to unite with it. But the dense and the subtle, if they are at the extreme horizon of their two attributes, their proximity and mixing is impossible except by intermediaries that suit them, like the mediation of air between fire and water which are opposites in both qualities, for it suits each one of them in one of the qualities, so it enables it by it to mix with it. There is no divergence more distant than that between the Body and the Non-Body. Therefore, the Soul will never attain its desire as it is except by the likes of those intermediaries, which are spirits arising from the Simple Mothers in the worlds of \"Bhurlok\" [Bhurloka], \"Bhubarlok\" [Bhuvarloka], and \"Svarlok\" [Svarloka]. They named them, corresponding to the dense bodies existing from the elements, \"Subtle Bodies\" (Lingasharira). The Soul shines upon them, so they become vehicles for it. By that union, it is like the imprint of the image of the sun, which is one, in several mirrors set up facing it, or waters poured in vessels placed parallel to it.

The Five Winds enter them: by two of them is the drawing of breath and sending it; by the third is the mixing of foods in the stomach; by the fourth is the jumping of the body from one place to another; and by the fifth is the transfer of sensation from one end of the body to another. Spirits, according to them, are not different in substance, stamped upon equality. Their characters and traces only differ due to the difference of the bodies coupled with them because of the three powers (Gunas) that struggle in them and corrupt them with envy and rage. This is the Higher Cause in the stirring to action. As for the Lower Cause from the side of Matter, it is its seeking of perfection and its preference for the better, which is the exit from potentiality to actuality. And by what is in the root of Nature of boasting and love of overcoming, it displays what is in it of varieties of the possible to the one who learns. The Soul circulates in varieties of plants and types of animals.

    "text": "...as we mentioned. It was said in \"Bishn Puran\" [Vishnu Purana]: Matter is the root of the world, and its action in it is by nature on the example of the action of the seed for the tree by nature without intent and choice, and like the cooling of the wind for the water without intent other than blowing; indeed voluntary action belongs to Bishn [Vishnu]. This is an indication from him to the Living who is above Matter, and by whom Matter becomes active, striving for him the striving of a friend for his friend without greed. Mani built his saying upon it: The Disciples asked Isa [Jesus], peace be upon him, about the life of the dead. He said to them: Indeed the dead, if the Living mixing with it separates and becomes distinct on its own, returns dead, not living; and the Living who separated from it, being alive, does not die. As for in the book \"Sank\" [Samkhya], he attributes action to Matter because the forms that occur are different in their difference due to the three first powers and their dominance, singly and paired—meaning the Angelic, the Human, and the Bestial. These powers belong to it, not the Soul. The Soul, to know its actions, is in the position of the spectators, on the example of one of the travelers who sat in a village to rest. Each one of its people is striving in other than what the other strives in. So he looks at them and considers their states, disliking some of them and loving some of them, and learning by them. He is occupied without having a share in them nor a cause in stirring them up. Action is only attributed to the Soul despite its innocence «1» of it on the example of a man for whom accompaniment happened with a group he did not know. They were thieves returning from a village they had raided and ruined. He did not travel with them but a little until the pursuit caught up with them. The group was secured, and that innocent one was taken in their group and according to the likeness of their condition. What befell them befell him without sharing with them in their deed. They said: The example of the Soul is the example of rainwater descending from the sky in its state and one quality. When it gathers in vessels placed for it differing in substance, of gold, silver, glass, pottery, clay, and salt marsh, it differs by them in appearance, taste, and smell. Likewise, the Soul does not effect in Matter other than life by neighborliness. When Matter begins to act, what appears from it differs due to the dominant power among the three powers and the assistance of the other two...",

    "text": "E - On the State of Souls and their Circulation by Reincarnation in the World\nJust as the testimony of the word of sincerity (Shahada) is the slogan of the faith of the Muslims, and the Trinity is the sign of Christianity, and the Sabbath is the sign of Judaism, likewise Reincarnation (Transmigration) is the science of the Indian creed. Whoever does not profess it is not of it and is not counted among its whole. For they said: Indeed the Soul, if it is not intelligent (knowing), does not encompass the objective with a complete encompassing at once without time. It needs the tracking of particulars and the induction of possibilities. Even if they are finite, their finite number is a multitude, and coming upon a multitude is compelled to a period possessing duration. Therefore, knowledge does not occur to the Soul except by witnessing persons and types and what alternates upon them of actions and conditions, until experience occurs to it in each one, and it benefits new knowledge by it. However, actions are different due to the powers (Gunas), and the world is not devoid of governance; rather, it is bridled and delegated to a purpose in it. So the remaining spirits circulate for that in the decaying bodies according to the variety of actions towards good and evil, so that the circulation in reward may be an alert to good, so it strives to increase it, and in punishment [an alert] to evil and the hated, so it exaggerates in distancing from it. The circulation becomes from the vilest to the best, not the reverse, because it bears both and requires difference of ranks in them due to the difference of actions by the divergence of mixtures and the measures of pairings in quantity and quality. This is Reincarnation, until there occurs from both sides of the Soul and Matter the perfection of the purpose. As for from the side of the Low (Matter), it is the annihilation of what is with Matter of form, except the repetition which is undesired. And as for from the side of the High (Soul), it is the departure of the Soul's yearning by its knowing what it did not know...",

So it turns away from it, and the bond is untied, the connection is broken, separation and detachment occur, and the return to the mine [occurs], winning from the happiness of knowledge the like of what the sesame seed takes from preparation and fires (or numbers and lights?), so it does not separate from its oil after that. The knower and the known unite and become one. It is incumbent upon us to present from their books something of their explicit speech in this chapter and what resembles it from the speech of others in it. \"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva] said to \"Arjun\" [Arjuna], inciting him to fight while they were between the two ranks: \"If you are a believer in the preceding decree, then know that they, and not we together, are dead or going a going with which there is no return. For souls are not dying nor changing. They only circulate in bodies according to the change of man from childhood to youth and middle age, then old age whose consequence is the death of the body, then the return.\" And he said to him: \"How can one mention death and killing who knows that the Soul is of eternal existence, not from birth nor to destruction and non-existence? Rather it is firm, standing; no sword cuts it, no fire burns it, no water drowns it, and no wind dries it. But it transfers from its body when it becomes old towards another, not like that, just as the body exchanges clothes when they wear out. So why is your grief for a soul that does not perish? If it were perishing, then it is more appropriate that you do not grieve for a missing thing that is not found and does not return. If you are glancing at the body without it and panicking at its corruption, then every born thing is dead and every dead thing returns. You do not have anything of both matters. Our concern is only to Allah from whom are all matters and to whom they become.\" When \"Arjun\" said to him during his speech: \"How did you fight Brahm in such-and-such [a time], while he is preceding the world, antecedent to mankind, and you are now among us known of birth and age?\" He answered him and said: \"As for the antiquity of the era, it encompassed me and you with him. How many times have we lived together! I have known their times and they were hidden from you. Whenever I intended coming for rectification, I put on a body, as there is no way to be with people except by becoming human.\" It was narrated about a king whose name I forgot that he ordered his people: to burn his corpse after his death in a place where no dead person had ever been burned. They sought a place like that, but it exhausted them until they found a rock protruding from the water of the sea. They thought they had succeeded in the desire. \"Basdiv\" said to them: \"Indeed this king was burned on this rock many times, so do what you want.\"",

    "text": "For he only intended to inform you, and his need has been fulfilled. And 'Basudeva' [Vasudeva/Krishna] said: 'He who hopes for salvation and strives to reject the world, but whose heart does not comply with the desired goal, is rewarded for his action in the gatherings of the rewarded ones, but he does not attain what he wanted due to his deficiency. However, he returns to the world and is qualified for a body of a kind specialized in asceticism. The divine inspiration in the other body grants him success to gradually achieve what his will was in the first body, and his heart begins to obey him. He continues to be purified in the bodies until he attains salvation through the succession of births.' Basudeva also said: 'If the soul is stripped of matter, it is knowing; but if it is clothed in it, it is ignorant due to its turbidity, thinking that it is the doer and that the works of the world are prepared for its sake. So it clings to them, and the sensory things are imprinted in it. When it separates from the body, the traces of the sensory things remain in it, so it does not separate from them completely; it yearns for them and returns towards them. Its acceptance of the contrasting changes in those states compels upon it the necessities of the first three powers. So what can it do if it is not prepared, being clipped of wing?' He also said: 'The best of people is the perfect scholar, because he loves Allah and Allah loves him. How often death and birth have repeated upon him while he, in the spans of his life, was diligent in seeking perfection until he attained it.' In 'Vishnu Dharma', there is the saying of 'Markandeya' when mentioning the spiritual beings: 'Each of Brahma, Kartikeya son of Mahadeva, Lakshmi the extracting of happiness from the sea, Daksha whom Mahadeva struck, and Umadeva the wife of Mahadeva, are in the middle of this Kalpa, and they were like that many times.' And 'Varahamihira' said in 'The Judgments of the Comets': 'And what befalls people upon their appearance of calamities that force evacuation from homes, emaciated from wasting away, wailing from affliction, taking the hands of children, walking them, whispering to each other, \"We have been seized for the sins of our kings,\" and answering each other, \"Nay, this is the recompense of what we earned in the previous abode before these bodies.\"' Mani [Manichaeism] was exiled from Iranshahr [Iran], so he entered the land of India and transferred the concept of transmigration from them to his sect.

    "text": "...Mysteries': 'When the disciples knew that souls do not die and that they are, in the repetition, turning into the likeness of every image they wear, and every creature they are molded into, and the likeness of every form poured into its hollow, they asked the Messiah [Jesus] about the fate of the souls that did not accept the truth and did not know the origin of their being. He said: \"Any weak soul that did not accept its companions from the truth is perishing, having no rest.\" He meant by its perishing its punishment, not its annihilation. For he also said: \"The Daisanites [Bardaisanites] thought that the ascension of the living soul and its purification is in the corpse of humans, and they did not know the enmity of the corpse toward the soul, its prevention of it from ascending, and that it is a prison and painful punishment for it. If this human form were true, its Creator would not have let it wear out and let harm occur in it, nor would He have necessitated reproduction by sperm in wombs.\"' As for the book of 'Patanjali', it is said: 'The likeness of the soul amidst the attachments of ignorance, which are the causes of bondage, is like rice within a husk. As long as it is with it, it is prepared for growth and harvest, wavering between being born and giving birth. But if the husk is removed from it, those accidents are cut off from it, and it remains in its state.' As for recompense, its existence is in the genera of beings in which the soul wavers according to the lifespan in length and shortness, and in the form of blessing in narrowness and abundance. The questioner said: 'What is the state of the spirit when it is caught between rewards and sins, then becomes entangled with the genus of beings for favor or vengeance?' The answerer said: 'It wavers according to what it sent forth and committed between ease and hardship, and fluctuates between pain and pleasure.' The questioner said: 'If a human earns what necessitates recompense in a mold (body) other than the mold of earning, the time between the two states is distant and the matter is forgotten?' The answerer said: 'Action is inherent to the spirit because it is its acquisition, and the body is a tool for it. There is no forgetfulness in psychic things, for they are outside of time which necessitates nearness and distance in duration. The action, by its adherence to the spirit, molds its character and nature to the likeness of the state to which...",

Its light is only covered by the turbidity of the body when it unites with it, like the example of a human remembering something he knew then forgot due to madness that befell him, or an illness that afflicted him, or intoxication that overcame his heart. Do you not see children and youths rejoicing at supplications for their long life and grieving at supplications for their speedy annihilation? What is it to them regarding these two, were it not that they tasted the sweetness of life and knew the bitterness of death in the past cycles in which they transmigrated for the existence of recompense?' The Greeks were in agreement with the Indians in this belief. Socrates said in the book 'Phaedo': 'We mention in the sayings of the ancients that souls go from here to Hades, then come also to what is here, and the living are from the dead, and things are from opposites; so those who died are among the living. Our souls in Hades are existing. The soul of every human rejoices and grieves for a thing and sees that thing as its own. This passivity binds it to the body, nails it to it, and makes it bodily in form. That which is not pure cannot go to Hades, but exits the body while full of it, such that it falls into another body quickly, as if it is deposited in it to remain. Therefore, it has no share in being with the one pure divine substance.' He said: 'If the soul is existing, then our learning is nothing but remembering what we learned in the past time, because our souls were in a place before becoming in this human form. When people see something they were accustomed to using in childhood, this passivity befalls them and they remember from the cymbal, for example, the boy who used to play it, whom they had forgotten. So forgetfulness is the departure of knowledge, and knowledge is the remembrance of what the soul knew before it came to the body.' Proclus said: 'Remembrance and forgetfulness are specific to the rational soul. It has become clear that it has always existed, so it must be that it has always been knowing and forgetting. Knowing when it separates from the body, and forgetting when it approaches the body. For in separation, it is from the domain of the intellect, so it is knowing; and in approaching, it descends from it, so forgetfulness befalls it due to the dominance of potentiality over it.'

The upper world is called 'Svarloka', which is Paradise. The lower world is 'Nagaloka', meaning the gathering of serpents, which is Hell; it is also called 'Naraloka', and perhaps they call it 'Patala', meaning the bottom of the earths. As for the middle one which we are in, it is called 'Madhyaloka' and 'Manushyaloka', meaning the gathering of humans. It is for earning, the upper is for reward, and the lower is for punishment. In them, the one who deserves them receives the full recompense of the deed for a set period according to the duration of the deed. Being in each of them is for the spirit alone, stripped of the body. For the one falling short of rising to Paradise or sinking to Hell, there is another Loka called 'Tiryagloka', which is plants and irrational animals. The spirit fluctuates in their individuals through transmigration until it transfers to humanity gradually from the lowest ranks of the growing (plants) to the highest ranks of the sensing (animals). Its being in it is for one of two reasons: either due to the deficiency of the amount of recompense for the two places of reward and punishment, or due to its return from Hell. For according to them, the one returning to the world is humanized in the beginning of his state, while the one returning to it from Hell fluctuates in plants and animals until he reaches the rank of a human. From the perspective of traditions, they multiply the number of hells, their descriptions, and names, and designate a place for every sin.

Some of them view the intermediate state for earning as humanity, and the fluctuation in it with recompense falling short of (great) reward and punishment. Then they view Paradise as high above it for the bliss deserved for a duration due to good deeds, and the fluctuation in plants and animals as lower than it for the torment and punishment deserved for a duration due to bad deeds; they do not see Hell as anything other than this descent from humanity. All of this is because the seeking of liberation from bondage might not be on its straight path leading to certain knowledge, but rather on conjectured paths taken by imitation. The deed of a doer, which is the conclusion of his deeds after balancing the two types of earning, will not be lost, but the recompense will be according to the intended purpose, so he attains it in degrees: either in his mold (body) in which he is, or in the one he transfers to, or after his exit from his mold and before obtaining another. This is the place of their turning from theoretical inquiry to religious report regarding the nature of the two abodes of reward and punishment, and being in them without being embodied in a body, and the return after fully receiving the wage of the work to embodiment and humanity to prepare for what is for him. For this reason, the author of the book 'Samkhya' did not count the reward of Paradise as good due to its expiration and lack of eternity, and due to the similarity of the state in it to the state of the world regarding competition and envy because of the disparity of degrees and ranks, for resentment and regret do not disappear except with equality. The Sufis do not count it as good from another perspective, which is distraction by other than the Truth (Allah) and being occupied from the Pure Good by what is other than Him. We have said: They view the spirit in these two places as stripped of corporeality; but this is the opinion of their elite who conceive the soul as self-subsistent. As for those who fall below their rank and can hardly conceive its existence without a body, they hold different opinions on that. Among them is that the cause of death is the spirit waiting for a prepared mold, so it does not leave the body until the existence of an attachment resembling its action and earning from what nature has prepared as a fetus in wombs or a seed sprouting in the belly of the earth; then it leaves the body it is in. Among them are those who say, from the perspective of traditions, that it does not wait for that, but rather leaves its mold due to its frailty, and a body called 'Ativahika' has been prepared for it from the elements. Its interpretation is 'that which comes into being quickly,' because it does not obtain by way of birth. So it remains in it for a year...",

Therefore, the heir of the deceased among them performs the rites of the year for the deceased, and they do not end until its expiration, because the spirit then goes to the place prepared for it. We mention here also from their books what declares these meanings. In 'Vishnu Purana': 'Maitreya' asked 'Parashara' about the purpose of Hell and punishment with it? He answered him that it is to distinguish good from evil, knowledge from ignorance, and to manifest justice. Not every sinner enters Hell, for some of them are saved by offering repentance and expiations, the greatest of which is adherence to the remembrance of 'Vishnu' in every action. And some of them fluctuate in plants, birds, and the vile and filthy creeping things like lice and worms until the duration of desert. In the book 'Samkhya': As for the one who deserves elevation and reward, he becomes like one of the angels, mixing with the spiritual gatherings, not veiled from acting in the heavens and being with their inhabitants, or like one of the eight genera of spiritual beings. As for the one who deserves lowness due to burdens and sins, he becomes an animal or a plant and fluctuates until he deserves a reward, so he escapes from hardship, or comprehends his essence, so he vacates his vehicle and becomes liberated. Some of the theologians (Mutakallimun) who inclined towards transmigration said: It is of four ranks: Naskh (Abrogation/Copying), which is reproduction among humans because it copies from one person to another; its opposite is Maskh (Transformation), and it is specific to humans being transformed into monkeys, pigs, and elephants; Raskh (Firmness), like plants, and it is more severe than Naskh because it is firmly rooted and remains over days and endures like mountains; and its opposite is Faskh (Dissolution), which is for plucked plants and slaughtered animals because they vanish and do not leave successors. Abu Yaqub al-Sijzi, the nicknamed, held the view in a book of his named 'Kashf al-Mahjub' (Unveiling the Veiled) that species are preserved and that transmigration in each of them does not cross into another species.

    "text": "...that he believed that rational souls become clothed in the bodies of beasts, and that he followed in that the myths of Pythagoras. Socrates said in the book 'Phaedo': 'The body is earthy, heavy, and weighty. The soul that loves it is transported and attracted to the place it looks at due to its anxiety over what has no form, and from \"Hades\", the gathering of souls. So it becomes polluted and wanders around graves and burial places. I have been shown in it souls that appeared in the form of shadow and imagination, from the souls that did not separate a pure separation, but rather contained a part of the object looked at.' Then he said: 'It is likely that these are not the souls of the good, but the souls of the people of gluttony. They wander in these things as a retribution they take from them due to the badness of their first sustenance. They remain so until they are bound again in a body by the lust of the bodily form that followed them. Their binding is in bodies of their character, like the characters they had in the world. For example, he who had nothing but eating and drinking enters the genera of donkeys and predatory beasts. And he who advanced injustice and domination, into the genera of wolves, falcons, and kites.' He said regarding the Gatherings: 'If I did not see myself going first to wise, master, good gods, then afterwards to humans who died better than those here, my leaving grief over death would be an injustice.' He said regarding the two places of Reward and Punishment: 'When a human dies, a \"Daemon\", who is one of the guards, goes with him to the gathering of judgment and carries him with those gathered there as an ordered guide to \"Hades\". Until he stays there what is appropriate of time, many and long cycles.' \"Telephus\" said: 'The road to Hades is simple.' He [Socrates] said: 'And I say if it were simple or single, the guide would not be needed on it. As for the soul that desires the body, or whose action was bad and unjust, and resembling the killer souls, it fled from there and took refuge in every species until times pass over it, so it is brought by necessity to the dwelling that resembles it. As for the pure one, it encounters companions and god-guides and inhabits the place that is appropriate.' He said: 'Whoever among the dead was of medium conduct, they ride upon mounts prepared...",

As for those who committed major sins such as stealing from the offerings of the gods, usurping great wealth, or killing unjustly and deliberately contrary to the laws, they are cast into \"Tartarus\" and never exit it. As for those who regretted their sins during their lifetime, and their sins fell short of that degree, such as offenses against parents and overcoming them with anger, and accidental killing, they are cast into Tartarus for a full year being tormented. Then the wave throws them to a place from which they call out to their adversaries, asking them to limit themselves to retaliation so they may escape the evils. If they accept from them, (good), otherwise they are returned to Tartarus. This remains their habit in torment until their adversaries are satisfied with them. Those whose conduct was virtuous are delivered from these places of this earth, rest from the prisons, and inhabit the pure earth.' Tartarus is a great chasm and abyss into which rivers flow. Every human expresses the punishment of the Hereafter with the most terrible thing known to his people. The western region is plagued by eclipses and deluges, although he describes it with what indicates the flaming of fires in it, as if he means by it the sea or an ocean containing a whirlpool. There is no doubt that these are the expressions of the people of that time regarding their beliefs.",

    "text": "VII. On the Manner of Liberation from the World and the Description of the Path Leading to it. Since the soul is bound in the world and its binding has a cause, its liberation from the bond is by the opposite of that cause. But we have related their doctrine that the cause of the bond is ignorance, so its liberation is then by knowledge, if it encompasses things with a comprehensive, distinguishing definition that dispenses with induction and negates doubts. Because if it details existents by definitions, it comprehends its essence and what it possesses of the honor of permanence, and what matter possesses of the baseness of change and annihilation in forms. So it dispenses with it and realizes that what it thought was good and pleasure is evil and hardship. Thus it obtains the reality of knowledge and turns away from clothing itself in matter, so the action is cut off, and they [soul and matter] are liberated by separation. The author of the book 'Patanjali' said: 'Singling out the thought on the Oneness of Allah occupies a person with perceiving something other than what he was occupied with. Whoever wants Allah wants good for all creation without excepting a single one for a cause. Whoever occupies himself with his soul to the exclusion of what is other than it, He does not make for it a drawn or sent breath. Whoever reaches this goal, his psychic power overcomes his bodily power, so he is granted power over eight things, by the attainment of which dispensing occurs. For it is impossible for anyone to dispense with what incapacitates him. One of those eight is the ability to make the body subtle until it is hidden from eyes. The second is the ability to make it light until treading on thorns, mud, and dust becomes equal to him. The third is the ability to make it great until he shows it in a...",

    "text": "...terrifying, amazing form. The fourth is the ability of wills (to attain wishes). The fifth is the ability to know what he seeks. The sixth is the ability to lead whatever group he seeks. The seventh is the submission of the led and their obedience. The eighth is the folding of distances between him and distant destinations.' Similar to this are the indications of the Sufis regarding the Knower (Gnostic) when he reaches the station of Knowledge (Ma'rifa); they claim that he obtains two spirits: an ancient one upon which change and difference do not pass, by which he knows the unseen and performs miracles, and another human one for change and coming into being. The sayings of the Christians are not far from the like of this. The Indians said: 'When he is capable of that, he dispenses with it and graduates to the objective in ranks. The first of them is knowing things by name and attribute and details that do not give definitions. The second is surpassing that to definitions which make the particulars of things universal, except that it is not devoid of detail therein. The third is the cessation of that detail and encompassing them united, but under time. The fourth is its stripping for him from time and his dispensing in it with names and titles which are tools of necessity; in it, the intellect, the intellecter, and the intellected unite until they become one thing.' This is what 'Patanjali' said regarding the knowledge that liberates the soul. They call its liberation in Indian 'Moksha', meaning the End/Consequence. They also call the complete clearing in solar and lunar eclipses by it, because it is the end of the eclipse and the occurrence of separation between the clinging ones. According to them, the senses and faculties were made for knowledge, and pleasure was placed in them as an incentive for research, just as the pleasure of eating and drinking was placed in taste to sustain the individual through nutrition, and the pleasure of sex to sustain the species through reproduction. Were it not for desire, the animal or human would not do them for these two purposes. In the book 'Gita': 'Man is created to know, and for the equality of knowledge, he was given tools equally. If he were created to work, the tools would have varied like the variation of works due to the variation of the first three powers. However, the bodily nature rushes to work because of its opposition to knowledge, so it seeks to cover it with pleasures which are in reality pains. Knowledge is what leaves this nature prostrate and clears the soul from darkness like the clearing of the sun from an eclipse or clouds.' This is like the saying of Socrates: 'When the soul is with the body and wants to investigate...",

    "text": "...something, it is deceived then by it. Through thought, something of the identities becomes clear to it. So its thought is in the time when nothing harms it of hearing, sight, pain, or pleasure; that is when it becomes by itself and leaves the body and sharing with it as much as possible. The soul of the philosopher specifically is the one that disdains the body and wants to separate from it. If we, in this life of ours, did not use the body and did not share with it except out of necessity, and did not acquire its nature but dissociated from it, we would approach knowledge by resting from its ignorance, and we would become pure by our knowledge of our essences until Allah releases us.' It is likely that this is the truth. Then we return to the context of the speech and say: Likewise, the rest of the faculties are for knowledge, and the Knower finds pleasure in deploying them in knowledges until they become his spies. Perception of things has different times. The senses that serve the heart (mind) perceive the present thing only. The heart reflects on the present and remembers the past. Nature takes over the present, claims it for itself in the past, and prepares to contend for it in the future. The intellect knows the quiddity of the thing, not attached to time or season, and the past and future are equal to it. The closest of its helpers to it are thought and nature, and the furthest are the five senses. Whenever they deliver to thought a partial piece of knowledge, it refines it from sensory fallacies, hands it over to the intellect, which makes it universal and informs the soul of it, so it becomes knowing by it. According to them, knowledge is obtained by the Knower in one of three ways: One is by inspiration and without time, but rather with birth and the cradle, like 'Kapila' the Sage, for he was born with knowledge and wisdom. The second is by inspiration after a time, like the sons of 'Brahma', for they were inspired when they reached their prime. The third is by learning and after a time, like the rest of people who learn when they mature. Arriving at salvation through knowledge only happens by abstaining from evil. Its branches, despite their multitude, return to Greed, Anger, and Ignorance; by cutting the roots, the branches wither. The pivot of that is upon the leadership of the powers of Lust and Anger, which are the most hostile enemy and most destructive to man; they deceive him with pleasure in foods and rest in revenge, while they are more deserving of leading to pains and sins.

And upon turning away from the works of the world; and he is not able to leave them except by rejecting their causes of greed and domination; by that, the second power of the first three is secluded. However, leaving work is of two ways: one is by laziness, delay, and ignorance according to the requirement of the third power; this is not the desired one, for its outcome is blameworthy. The second is by choice, insight, and preferring the better for betterment; this is the one of praiseworthy consequence. Leaving works is not complete except by seclusion and isolation from distractions to be able to withdraw the senses from external sensory objects so that he does not know that there is anything behind him, and quieting movements and breathing. For it is known that the greedy one is striving, the striver is tired, and the tired one is panting; so panting is then the result of greed. With its cessation, breathing becomes like the breathing of one who does not need air in the depth of water. Then the heart settles on one thing, which is seeking salvation and purity to the absolute Oneness. In the book 'Gita': 'How can one attain salvation who has scattered his heart and did not single it out for Allah, and did not make his work pure for His face? He who turns his thought from things to the One, the light of his heart becomes steady like the steadiness of the light of a lamp with pure oil in a shelter where no wind shakes it. That occupies him from sensing any pain of heat or cold, due to his knowledge that everything other than the One Truth is a false imagination.' In it also: 'Pain and pleasure do not affect the real scholar, just as the continued pouring of rivers into the sea does not affect its water.' And can anyone scale this mountain pass except one who has suppressed Lust and Anger and nullified them? For the sake of this which was mentioned, thought must be connected with a connection from which number disappears, because number applies to times (instances), and times do not exist without heedlessness intervening between them, separating them and preventing the union of the thought with the object of thought. This is not the desired goal; rather, it is the continuity of thought. One graduates to it either in a single body or in bodies by adhering to virtuous conduct and habituating the soul to it until it becomes a nature and an essential attribute for it. Virtuous conduct is what religion imposes. Its principles, after the multitude of branches, return according to them to several comprehensive points: that he does not kill, does not lie, does not steal, does not commit adultery, and does not hoard. Then he adheres to holiness...",

    "text": "...and purity, perpetuates fasting and asceticism, holds fast to the worship of Allah with glorification and praise, and perpetuates the passing of 'Om', which is the word of formation and creation, over his heart without speaking it. That is because leaving killing in animals is a type whose genus is refraining from harm and injury; usurping what belongs to others and lying enter into it, beyond what is in it of ugliness and baseness. In leaving hoarding is the shaking off of fatigue, safety from the seeker of surplus, and obtaining relief from the humiliation of slavery through the glory of freedom. In adhering to purity is an awareness of the filth of the body and a motive to hate it and love the pure soul. In punishing the soul with asceticism is its refinement, the quieting of its greed, and the sharpening of its senses. As 'Pythagoras' said to a man who cared for fattening his body and giving it desires: 'You are not falling short in constructing your prison and strengthening your bond and tightening it.' In holding fast to the remembrance of Allah Almighty and the angels is familiarity with them. In the book 'Samkhya': 'Everything a man thinks is his goal, he does not go beyond it.' In the book 'Gita': 'Everything a man perpetuates thinking about and remembering is imprinted in him such that he is guided by it without intent. And because the time of death is the time of remembering what he loves, if the spirit separates from the body, it unites with that thing and transforms into it.' Everything that has a going and a return, union with it is not pure salvation. Although it was said in this book: 'He who knows at his death that Allah is everything and from Him is everything is saved, even if his rank falls short of the ranks of the truthful.' In it also: 'Seek salvation from the world by leaving attachment to its ignorances, sincerity of intention in works, fire sacrifices to Allah without greed for reward and recompense, and withdrawal from people, the reality of which is that you do not prefer one for friendship over another for enmity. Contradict heedlessness in sleep at the time of their waking, and waking at the time of their sleep, for it is withdrawal from them while witnessing with them. Then guarding the soul from the soul (self), for it is the enemy if it desires, and an excellent ally if it abstains.' Socrates said upon his lack of concern for being killed and his joy at joining his Lord: 'My rank should not be lower with any of you than the rank of the \"Cygnus\" [Swan], which is said to be the bird of \"Apollo the Sun\", and that it knows the unseen for that reason, and that if...",

    "text": "...it senses its death, it increases its melodies in rapture and joy at going to its master. My joy at reaching my worshipped one should not be less than the joy of this bird.' For this reason, the Sufis said in defining Love (Ishq): 'It is being occupied with the creation (or distraction) from the Truth (Allah).' In the book 'Patanjali': We divide the path of salvation into three sections. One is practical, by habituation and management of withdrawing the senses from outside to inside until they are not occupied except by You. Sufficiency (moderate living) has been permitted for whoever seeks this. In the book 'Vishnu Dharma': 'Parikshit' the King, who is from the lineage of 'Puru', asked 'Shatanika', the head of a group of sages who attended him, about a meaning of the divine meanings? He answered him that he would not say anything about it except what he heard from 'Shaunaka', and he from 'Ushanas', and he from 'Brahma': 'Allah is He who has no beginning and no end, was not born from anything and did not beget anything, except that He who cannot be said to be \"He\" cannot be said to be \"other than Him\". How can I have the capacity to mention One who is pure Good in His satisfaction and pure Evil in His wrath? Is it possible to attain knowledge of Him so He is worshipped as He deserves except by being occupied with Him from the world entirely and perpetuating thought on Him?' It was said to him: 'Man is weak and his life is scant and slight. His soul hardly obeys him to leave the necessities in his livelihood, so that prevents him from the path of salvation. If it were in the first time when lifespans extended to thousands of years and the world was good due to the absence of evils, doing the duty would be hoped for. As for the end of time, what do you see for him in the rotating world so that he can cross the sea and escape drowning?' Brahma said: 'Man must have food, shelter, and clothing, so there is no harm in them. But rest is only in leaving what is other than them of superfluities and the troubles of works. So worship Allah purely, prostrate to Him, draw near to Him in the place of worship with gifts of perfume and flowers, glorify Him, bind Him to your hearts so they do not leave Him, give charity to Brahmins and others, vow to Him special vows like leaving meat and general ones like fasting. Animals belong to Him, so do not distinguish them from yourselves and kill them. Know that He is everything, so whatever you do, let it be for His sake. Even if you enjoy something of the ornaments of the world, do not forget Him in intention, and that your purpose in it is piety and empowerment...",

    "text": "...to worship Him. By this, you attain salvation, not by anything else.' It was said in 'Gita': 'Whoever kills his desire does not exceed the necessary needs, and whoever sticks to sufficiency is not disgraced nor deemed base.' It is also said in it: 'If man cannot dispense with what nature compels him to, of food to quell the fire of hunger, sleep to remove the aggression of tiring movements, and a seat to rest in, then its condition is cleanliness, softness, moderation in height from the face of the earth, sufficiency for the body to spread on it, and a place of moderate temperament not harmful with cold or heat, safe from the approach of vermin. For that aids in defining the heart for perpetuating the thought on Oneness. Because what is other than necessities in food and clothing are pleasures, and they are covered hardships; resting in them is interrupted, and [resting] in the hardest hardship is impossible. Pleasure is only for him who has killed the two enemies that cannot be tolerated, I mean Lust and Anger, in his life not his death, and rested from his inside not his outside, thus dispensing with his senses.' 'Basudeva' said to 'Arjuna': 'If you want pure Good, guard the nine gates of your body, know the one entering and exiting them, restrain your heart from spreading its thoughts, and quiet the soul by remembering the aperture of the fontanelle which closed and hardened after its softness so it was not needed. And do not view sensation except as a nature in the instruments of the senses so that you do not follow it.' The second section is Intellectual (by neglect/renunciation), by knowing the vileness of changing existents and perishing forms until the heart flees from them, greed is cut off from them, and supremacy is obtained over the first three powers which are the cause of actions and their difference. That is because the one who encompasses the conditions of the world knows that its good is evil and its rest is impossible in recompense to hardship, so he turns away from what confirms entanglement and generates remaining. In the book 'Gita': 'People have gone astray in commands and prohibitions and have not been guided to distinguish good from evil in actions; so leaving them and abandoning them is the Action.' In it also: 'The purity of knowledge exceeds the purity of all other things, because by knowledge is the eradication of ignorance and the exchange of certainty for doubt which is the substance of torment; for there is no rest for a doubter.' It is known from that that the first section is a tool for the second. Then the third section is more worthy to be a tool for both, which is Worship, so that Allah grants success for attaining salvation and qualifies for a mold in which graduation to happiness is attained.

Upon the body are fasting, prayer, requirements of the law, serving the angels and Brahmin scholars, cleaning the body, dissociating from killing entirely and from looking at what belongs to others of women and others. Upon the voice are recitation, glorification, adhering to truth, being gentle with people, guiding them, and enjoining them to good. Upon the heart are rectifying the intention, leaving arrogance, adhering to patience, and gathering the senses with expansion of the chest (joy/peace). Then he followed it with a fourth legendary section called 'Rasayana' [Alchemy], which are managements with medicines that run the course of alchemy in obtaining impossible things by them. Mention of it will come, and it has no connection to this art except from the side of determination and correcting the intention by believing in it and striving to obtain it. They only went in liberation to Union because Allah is independent of hoping for reward or fearing opposition, free from thoughts due to His transcendence above hated opposites and loved peers, knowing by His essence not by knowledge occurring for what was not known to Him in some state. This is also the attribute of the liberated one according to them; he does not separate from Him in it except in the beginning (origin). For he was not like that in the pre-eternal past because he was before that in the place of entanglement, knowing the known, and his knowledge was like imagination acquired by effort, and his known was in the guarantee of covering. As for the place of salvation, the covers are lifted, the lids are removed, the obstacles are cut, and the essence is knowing, not eager to know a hidden thing, separated from the decaying sensory things, united with the permanent intelligible things. Therefore, the questioner asked at the end of the book 'Patanjali' about the nature of salvation? The answerer said: 'If you wish, say it is the suspension of the three powers and their return to the mine from which they issued. And if you wish, say it is the return of the soul, knowing, to its nature.' The two men disagreed about the one who obtained the rank of salvation. The hermit asked in the book 'Samkhya': 'Why does death not occur at the cessation of action?' The Sage said: 'Because the cause for separation is a psychic state, and the spirit is still in the body. Nothing separates them except a natural state that separates the union. Perhaps the effect remains after the disappearance of the cause for a period in which it slackens and retreats until...",

It does not stop with the removal of the spinning stick from it, but its movement slackens little by little until it ceases. Likewise the body, after the lifting of the action, the trace remains in it until it is spent in hardship and ease towards the cessation of the natural force and the annihilation of the previous trace; so the perfection of salvation is at the falling down of the body.' As for the book 'Patanjali', what witnesses to the like of the foregoing is his saying regarding the one who withdrew his senses and feelings like the turtle withdraws its limbs upon fear: 'He is not trusted because he untied the knot, nor is he liberated because his body is with him.' That which contradicts it from his speech is his saying: 'Bodies are nets for spirits to fulfill recompense. The one who reaches the degree of salvation has fulfilled it in his mold regarding past action, then became suspended from earning for the future. So he unraveled from the net, dispensed with the mold, and moved in it without being entangled. He is capable of moving to wherever he likes and whenever he wants, not by way of death. For the dense, cohesive bodies are not hindering to his mold, so how about his body to his spirit?' The Sufis go to something close to this. It has been narrated in their books about some of them: 'A group of Sufis came to us and sat at a distance from us. One of them stood up to pray. When he finished, he turned and said to me: \"O Sheikh, do you know a place here suitable for us to die in?\" I thought he wanted to sleep, so I pointed to a place. He went and threw himself on his back and became still. I went to him and moved him, and lo, he had become cold.' And they said regarding the saying of Allah Almighty \"Indeed, We established him upon the earth\" [Quran 18:84]: 'That if he wishes, it is folded for him, and if he wishes, he walks on water and air; they support him in it, and mountains do not resist him in purpose.' As for those who lagged behind the rank of salvation despite their diligence, their degrees vary. It is said in 'Samkhya': 'He who advances towards the world with good conduct, generous with what he owns of it, is recompensed in the world by obtaining wishes and will, and fluctuating in it in happiness, envied in body, soul...",

The ascetic in the world without knowledge wins elevation and reward but is not liberated due to the lack of the instrument. The content, dispensed one, if he is empowered over the eight mentioned states and is deceived by them and succeeds and thinks they are salvation, remains at them.' A parable was struck for those differing in degrees of knowledge by a man who went out early in the dark with his students for a need. An upright figure obstructed them on the road; the darkness of the night prevented knowing its reality. The man turned to his students and asked them about it one after another. The first said: 'I do not know what it is.' The second said: 'I do not know it, and I have no power to know it.' The third said: 'There is no benefit in knowing it, for the rising of the day will reveal it. If it is a hidden thing, it will leave by morning, and if it is otherwise, its matter will become clear to us.' All three fell short of knowledge: the first by ignorance, the second by incapacity and a defect in the instrument, and the third by laxity and satisfaction with ignorance. As for the fourth, he did not find an answer before verification, so he aimed for it. When he approached it, he saw a pumpkin vine wrapped around it. He knew that a living, choosing human does not remain standing in his place until that wrapping occurs on him, and he verified that it was inanimate, erected. Then he did not feel safe that it might be a hiding place for a deceptive thing, so he approached it and kicked it with his foot until it fell, and the doubt about its matter was removed. He returned to his master with the certain news, having won knowledge from his own hands. As for the resemblance of the Greeks' speech to these meanings, 'Ammonius' narrated from Pythagoras his saying: 'Let your eagerness and diligence in this world be for connection with the First Cause which is the Cause of your cause, so that your remaining may be eternal and you escape corruption and extinction, and proceed to the world of true sense, true joy, and true glory in uninterrupted joy and pleasures.' Pythagoras said: 'How do you hope for dispensing while wearing bodies, and how do you attain emancipation while you are imprisoned in them?' 'Ammonius' said: 'As for Empedocles and those before him up to Heraclitus, they saw that filthy souls remain clinging to the world until they seek help from the Soul...'",

    "text": "Universal [Soul], so it humbles itself to the Intellect, and the Intellect to the Creator, so He pours His light upon it, and the Intellect pours from it upon the Universal Soul while it is in this world. It becomes illuminated by it until the Particular [Soul] sees the Universal [Soul] and connects with it, joining its world, except that this happens after many eons pass over it. Then it proceeds to where there is no place, no time, and nothing of what is in this world of fatigue or interrupted joy.\nSocrates said: The soul by itself proceeds to the Holiness that is Ever-Living, eternally steadfast, due to what is in it of similarity upon abandoning spatial confinement. It becomes like it in permanence because it is affected by it in a manner resembling contact, and its affection is called Intellect. He also said: The soul is very similar to the Divine Substance which does not die and does not dissolve, and the One Intelligible steadfast in eternity, while the body «1» is contrary to it. When they join, nature commands the body to serve and the soul to rule. When they separate, the soul goes to other than the place of the body and becomes happy with what resembles it, resting from spatial confinement, foolishness, anxiety, passion, loneliness, and other human evils. That is if it was pure and hating the body. But if it became defiled by agreeing with the body, serving it, and loving it until the body subjugated it with desires and pleasures, it does not see anything more worthy than the corporeal type and touching it.\n\"Abruqlus\" [Proclus] said: The body which the rational soul occupied before the spherical shape is like the ether «2» and its individuals. And that which the non-rational [soul] occupied before uprightness is like the human. And that which the non-rational [soul] occupied alone before uprightness with bending is like the non-rational animals. And that which was devoid of both and nothing existed in it other than the vegetative power before uprightness, and its bending was completed by inversion and its head was planted in the earth, is like the condition in plants. Since it became contrary to the human, the human is a heavenly tree whose root is towards its origin, which is the sky, just as the root of the plant became towards its origin, which is the earth.\nThe Indians went regarding nature to something similar to that. \"Arjun\" [Arjuna] said: What is the example of Brahm in the world? \"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva/Krishna] said: Imagine him as the \"Ashvattha\" «3» tree, which is known...",

Its nourishment became abundant until it thickened, and its branches spread «1» and clung to the earth and hung from it. Its branches and roots resembled each other in both directions so they became confused. Brahm is the upper roots of this tree, its trunk is \"Bed\" [Veda], its branches are opinions and doctrines, its leaves are explanations and interpretations, its nourishment is by the three powers, and its thickening and cohesion is by the senses. The wise person has nothing but cutting it with a sharp axe, which is asceticism in the world and its adornments. If he succeeds in cutting it, he seeks from its Originator the place of settlement in which return (rebirth) is nonexistent. If he attains it, he leaves the harm of heat and cold behind him and arrives from the light of the two luminaries and fires to the Divine Lights.\nThe Sufis went to the path of \"Patanjal\" [Patanjali] in occupation with the Truth. They said: As long as you point, you are not a monotheist until the Truth takes over your pointing by annihilating it from you, so neither a pointer nor a pointing remains. In their speech is what indicates the saying of Union (Ittihad), like the answer of one of them about the Truth: \"How do I not verify He who is 'I' in I-ness and 'Not I' in where-ness? If I returned, then by return I separated; and if I neglected, then by negligence I lightened; and by Union, I joined.\" And like the saying of Abu Bakr al-Shibli: \"Cast off the all, you reach us in totality, so you be and not be; your reporting is about us and your action is our action.\" And like the answer of Abu Yazid al-Bistami when he was asked, \"By what did you attain what you attained?\": \"I shed myself as the snake sheds its skin, then I looked at my essence, and lo, I was He.\" They said regarding the saying of Allah the Exalted \"So We said, strike him with part of it\" «2»: The command to kill the dead to revive the dead is information that the heart does not live by the lights of knowledge except by killing the body through striving until it remains a trace with no reality, and your heart is a reality with no trace of the traces upon it. They said: Between the servant and Allah are a thousand stations of light and darkness. The striving of the people is only in cutting through the darkness to the light. When they reached the stations of light, they had no return.",

    "text": "H - On the Genera of Creatures and their Names\nThis is a chapter difficult to obtain with verification because we view it from the outside, and those people do not refine it. Because of our need for it in what follows, we establish from it all that has been heard up to the time of writing these letters. We narrate first what is in the book \"Sank\" [Samkhya] of it. The Ascetic said: How many are the genera of living bodies and their types? The Sage said: Their genera are three: the Spirituals in the highest, Humans in the middle, and Animals in the lowest. As for their types, they are fourteen. Of them for the Spirituals are eight: Brahm [Brahma], Indra, Prajapat [Prajapati], Saumya «1», Gandharb [Gandharva], Yaksh [Yaksha], Rakshas [Rakshasa], and Pishach [Pishacha]. And of them for the Animals are five: cattle, wild beasts, birds, creeping things, and growing things, meaning trees. And Humans are one type. The author of this book enumerated them in another place in it with other names thus: Brahm, Indra, Prajapat, Gandharb, Yaksh, Rakshas, Pitr [Pitri], Pishach. These are a people who rarely observe order and guess greatly in enumeration, so names with them are many and the field is empty.\n\"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva] said in \"Gita\" [Gita]: Indeed the first power of the three first [Gunas], if it dominates, is composed on intellect, purification of senses, and work for the angels; therefore, comfort becomes of its followers and salvation of its results. If the second dominates, it is composed on greed and leads «2» to fatigue and incites to the works...",

If the third dominates, it is composed on ignorance and deception by wishes until it generates sleeplessness, negligence, laziness, delaying of the obligatory, and constant slumber. If he works, it is for the genera of \"Bhut\" [Bhuta] and \"Pishach\" [Pishacha], the devils, and for \"Pret\" [Preta] carrying souls in the air, neither in Paradise nor in Hell; and its consequence is punishment and descent from the rank of humans to animals and plants. He said in another place in it: Faith and virtue are from the Spirituals in \"Dev\" [Deva]. Therefore, he who resembles them among humans becomes a believer in Allah, holding fast to Him, yearning for Him. Disbelief and vice are in the devils named \"Asur\" [Asura] and \"Rakshas\" [Rakshasa]. He who resembles them among humans becomes a disbeliever in Allah, not turning to His commands, stripping the world of Him, occupied with what harms in both abodes and does not benefit.\nIf these sayings are combined, the disorder appears from them in names and in order. As for what is famous among the public of the eight genera of Spirituals, it is \"Dev\" [Deva], and they are the angels; they have the direction of the North and their specialty is India. It has been said: \"Zardusht\" [Zoroaster] opposed the Shamaniyya [Buddhists] in naming the devils with the name of the most noble class among them, and that remained in Persian from the side of Magianism. Then \"Daitya Danava\", and they are the Jinn who are in the direction of the South; in their share is everyone who opposed the creed of India and was hostile to the cow. Despite the closeness of kinship between them and the angels, they claimed: Conflict does not cease between them nor do their wars calm down. Then \"Gandharb\" [Gandharva], the masters of melodies and songs before the angels; their harlots are called \"Apsaras\". Then \"Yaksh\" [Yaksha], the treasurers of the angels. Then \"Rakshas\" [Rakshasa], deformed devils. Then \"Kinnar\" [Kinnara], in the form of humans except their heads, for they are heads of horses, contrary to the Centaurs (Qantursat) of the Greeks, for the form of the horse is in the lower half of the body and the form of the human is in its upper «1» half, and of it is the image of Sagittarius. Then \"Nag\" [Naga], and they are in the form of serpents. Then \"Vidyadhar\" [Vidyadhara], and they are Jinn sorcerers whose magic does not last in currency. So the Angelic power is at the first end, devilry is at the lower end, and mixing is between the two ends.",

    "text": "Their attributes only differed because they attained this rank by work, and works are different according to the three powers. Their duration was long due to their stripping from bodies. Obligation was removed from them, and they were capable of what humans were incapable of, so they served them in demands and drew near to them in needs. We should know from what we narrated from \"Sank\" that it is not verified. For \"Brahm\", \"Indra\", and \"Prajapat\" are not names for types. Rather, Brahm and Prajapat are close in meaning; their names differ by the difference of a certain attribute. And \"Indra\" is the chief of the worlds. Also, \"Basdiv\" counted \"Yaksh\" and \"Rakshas\" together in one class of devilry, and the \"Puranas\" speak regarding Yaksh: That they are treasurers and servants of treasurers.\nWe say after this: The mentioned Spirituals are a class that attained their rank by work at the time of being human and left bodies behind them, for they are weights removing ability and shortening duration. Their attributes and conditions differed according to the dominance of the three first powers over them. \"Dev\", meaning the angels without matter, were specialized with the first of them [Sattva], and comfort and happiness were obtained for them, and the conception of the intelligible outweighed in them, just as the conception of the sensible in matter outweighed in humans. \"Pishach\" and \"Bhut\" were specialized with the third [Tamas], and the ranks between them with the second [Rajas]. They said regarding the number of Dev: It is thirty-three Koti (Crore); of it for Mahadev is eleven. Therefore, this number became one of his titles and his name indicating it. The total of the mentioned number for the angels is [330,000,000]. Then they allowed for them the meaning of eating, drinking, intercourse, life, and death because they are in the realm of matter, even if they are from it in the subtler, simpler side, and because they attained that by work, not knowledge. In the book of \"Patanjal\": \"Nandikeshvara\" «1» increased sacrifices to Mahadev, so he transferred to Paradise in his corporeal mold. And \"Indra\" the Chief committed adultery with the wife of \"Nahusha\" the Brahmin, so he was transformed into a snake by way of punishment. Beneath them is the rank of \"Pitrin\" [Pitris], the dead fathers. Beneath these are \"Bhut\", humans who have connected with spirituality and mediated. As for those who passed the rank not stripped of the body, they are called \"Rishi\" and \"Siddha\" [?] and they differ...",

Siddha is the one who attained by his work power over what he wills in the world and restricted himself to that and did not strive in the path of salvation. He has the ascent to the rank of \"Rishi\". To it the Brahmin graduates and is called \"Brahmarshi\". If a \"Kshatriya\" graduates to it, he is called \"Rajarshi\", and that is not for those below them. \"Rishis\" are the sages who, despite their humanness, are better than the angels due to knowledge; therefore, the angels benefit from them. There is none above them except Brahm. Below these are their classes existing among us, and for their mention is a separate chapter.\nAll of these are under Matter. As for the conception of what «1» is above it, we said «2»: The Hyle (Hayula) is an intermediary between Matter and what is above it of psychic and divine meanings. In it are the three first powers in potentiality. It is as if the Hyle, with what is in it, is a bridge from the high to the low. What flows in it upon the first power [Sattva] purely is called \"Brahm\" [Brahma] and \"Prajapat\" [Prajapati] and many other names from the perspective of law and reports. Its meaning returns to Nature in the prime of its action, because creation until the creation of the world is attributed to Brahm by them. What flows in it upon the second power [Rajas] is called \"Narayan\" [Narayana] in the reports. Its meaning returns to Nature at the end of its action reaching its limit, for it strives then in preservation, just like the striving of Narayan in rectifying the world so it remains. What flows in it upon the third power [Tamas] is called \"Mahadev\" and \"Shankar\" [Shankara], and his most famous name is \"Rudra\", and he is for corruption «3» and annihilation, like Nature in the ends of its action and the languor of its power. Their names only differ after the flowing in these ascents and steps to the low, so their actions differ. As for before that, the source is one. Therefore, they combine them in it and do not separate one of them from the other and call him \"Bishn\" [Vishnu]. This name is more appropriate for the middle power; rather, they do not distinguish between it and the First Cause. They go the way of the Christians in distinguishing the names of the Hypostases (Persons) by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit from each other and combining them in one substance.

One should not wonder «1» at their sayings regarding the class of \"Dev\" which we expressed as angels «2» and their allowing for them what minds do not allow of what the theologians of Islam cleared them from regarding its permissible, let alone its forbidden. For if you combine those sayings of theirs with the sayings of the Greeks in their creed, the strangeness disappears. We have presented that they used to call the angels \"gods\". So review what was narrated for them regarding \"Zeus\" so that you verify what we said. As for what proceeds in it from the resemblance of animality and humanity, it is their saying: That when he was born, his father wanted to eat him. His mother preceded by wrapping a stone in rags and fed it to him until he left. Galen mentioned that in the \"Book of Miamir\" in his saying: That \"Philon\" «3» spoke in riddles in describing the electuary of \"Philonia\" in his poetry and said: Take red hair «4» from the hair from which the scent of perfume wafts, which is the offering of the gods, and its blood; and weigh from it weights according to the minds of people. He meant by that saffron, five mithqals, because the senses are five. He mentioned the rest of the mixtures with their weights in types of symbols which Galen interpreted. Among them: And from the root lied against, which grew in the land in which \"Zeus\" was born. He said: This is the spikenard because it is lied against in its name; it was named \"Sumbul\" (Spike) but it is not a spike; rather it is a root. He ordered it to be \"Cretan\" because the people of proverbs say about \"Zeus\" that he was born on Mount \"Dicte\" in \"Crete\" where his mother used to hide him «5» from his father \"Cronus\" so he would not swallow him as he swallowed others.

That was far in time from the exit of the Children of Israel from the Wilderness to the land of Palestine. And what was mentioned that he died in Crete and was buried there in the time of \"Samson\" the Israelite, and he was seven hundred and eighty years old. And that he was named \"Zeus\" when his life became long after he used to be called \"Dios\". And that the first who named him by this name was \"Cecrops\" the first king in Athens. The situation between them in collusion was on what they inclined to of releasing the phallus right and left and easing the leadership of leadership on the resemblance of the situation of \"Zoroaster\" with \"Gushtasp\" in what they aimed for of strengthening the kingdom and politics. Historians have claimed that scandals among the people occurred from Cecrops and the kings who rose after him. They meant by that the likeness of what is in the accounts of Alexander, that \"Nectanebo\" King of Egypt, when he fled from \"Artaxerxes\" the Black (Ochus) and hid in the city of \"Macedonia\" «2» practicing astrology and divination, tricked \"Olympias\" the wife of \"Philip\" its king while he was absent, until he used to cover her deceptively and show himself in the form of \"Amun\" the god in the figure of a ram-horned serpent until she became pregnant with Alexander. \"Philip\" almost disowned him and exiled him upon his return, then he saw in a dream that he was the offspring of the god Amun, so he accepted him and said there is no opposition with the gods. The death of \"Nectanebo\" was at the hands of Alexander by way of hugging «3» (pushing into a pit) during astrology, and from that he knew that he was his father. The likes of this are many in their accounts, and we will bring «4» its counterparts in the marriages of the Indians.

The commentator on the book \"Phenomena\" claimed that he differed from the poets in their beginning with the gods, that he decided to speak on the sphere. Then he looked also as Galen looked into the lineage of \"Asclepius\" and said: We would love to know which Zeus Aratus meant, the symbolic or the natural?

Then if that relied on a side of the sides of a creed, the two twins met, and the matter was completed by the meeting of Kingship and Religion, and there is no goal beyond perfection that is intended.\nThe ancient kings concerned with their craft used to direct most of their concern to classifying people into classes and ranks, guarding them from mixing and chaos, forbidding intermingling upon them because of it, binding every class to what is for it of work or craft and profession, not licensing anyone to exceed his rank, and punishing whoever was not satisfied with his class.

The Indians in our days have the most ample shares of that, such that our differing from them and our equalizing among the whole except by piety is the greatest of barriers between them and Islam. They call their classes \"Varna\", meaning Colors, and they call them from the perspective of lineage \"Jataka\" [Jati], meaning Births. These classes in the beginning of the matter are four. Their highest is the \"Brahmins\". It has been mentioned in their books that their creation is from the head of \"Brahm\" [Brahma], and that this name is a metonymy for the power called \"Nature\". The head is the highest part of the animal, so the Brahmins are the choice of the genus, and therefore they became with them the best of mankind. The class that follows them is \"Kshatriya\". They were created, by their claim, from the shoulders of Brahm and his hands. Their rank is not very far from the rank of the Brahmins. Below them are \"Vaishya\". They were created from the legs of Brahm. These two last ranks are close. Despite their distinction, cities and villages bring them together; the four of them are mixed in dwellings and houses. Then the possessors «1» of professions below these are not counted in a class other than the craft, and they are called \"Antyaja\". They are eight types by crafts, and they intermingle with what resembles them of other crafts except the fuller, the shoemaker, and the weaver, for the rest of them do not descend to their craft. They are the fuller, the shoemaker, the juggler, the weaver of baskets and shields, the sailor, the fisherman, the hunter of wild beasts and birds, and the weaver. The four classes do not dwell with them in a town; rather, they shelter in dwellings near it and outside it. As for \"Hadi\", \"Dom\", \"Chandala\", and \"Badhatau\", they are not counted in anything. They are only occupied with the vilest of works of cleaning villages and serving them. All of them are one genus distinguished by work like the child of adultery. For it was mentioned that they return to a \"Shudra\" father and a \"Brahmin\" mother, having come out of them by fornication, so they are outcasts, degraded. Marks and titles attach to every one of the people of the classes according to his action and way. Like the Brahmin, for example; this is his mark absolutely if he keeps to his house in his work. If he keeps to serving one fire, he is titled \"Ishti\". If he serves three of the fires, he is \"Agnihotri\". If he offers to the fire along with that, he is \"Dikshit\". Likewise are these, except that \"Hadi\" is the most praiseworthy of them...",

After them, one becomes a candidate for killing and punishments as a craft and takes charge of it «2». The worst of them is \"Badhatau\" «3», for he does not restrict himself to eating the usual carrion but exceeds it to dogs and the likes of that. Each class of the four lines up in eating separately. A row does not include two individuals of different classes. If in a row of Brahmins, for example, there are two individuals among them who are mutually averse and their seats are close, a separation is made between the two seats by a board placed between them, or a cloth extended, or another thing; indeed, a line is drawn between them as a distinction. Because the leftover from food is forbidden, it necessitates being solitary with the eaten, because if one of the eaters takes from a single bowl, what remains by the taking of the other and the cessation of the eating of the first becomes a forbidden leftover.\nThis is the condition of the four classes. \"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva] said when \"Arjun\" «4» asked him about the natures of the four classes and what morals they must characterize themselves with: The \"Brahmin\" must be of ample intellect, calm heart, truthful tongue, apparent endurance, controlling the senses, preferring justice, of apparent cleanliness, approaching worship, his concern directed to religion. And the \"Kshatriya\" must be awesome in hearts, brave, aggrandizing, eloquent of tongue, generous of hand, indifferent to hardships, eager to ease difficulties. And the \"Vaishya\" must be occupied with agriculture, acquiring cattle, and trade. And the \"Shudra\" must be diligent in service and flattery, endearing himself to everyone by it. Everyone of these, if he remains firm on his custom and habit, attains the good in his will if he is not falling short in the worship of Allah, not forgetting His mention in most of his works. If he transfers from what is for him to what is for another class, even if it is nobler than him, it is a sin by transgression in the command.

For reward is not attained except by that. If he wins, then to kingship and bliss; and if he perishes, then to Paradise and mercy. Beyond what you show of softness for the enemy and panic over the killing of this group is the spreading of your news of cowardice and failure, the departure of your reputation from among the tyrants and the strong brave ones, and your fall from their eyes and your name from their whole. I do not know a punishment more severe than this condition. So death is better than exposure to what bequeaths shame. If Allah commanded you and qualified your class for fighting and created you for it, then execute His command and implement His will with a resolve stripped of greeds so that your work is for Him. As for Salvation (Moksha), they differed regarding who is prepared for it among these classes. Some of them said: It is for none other than the \"Brahmins\" and \"Kshatriya\" what is not possible for them alone of learning the \"Bed\" [Veda]. The verifiers among them said: Salvation is common to the classes and to all the human type if intention is obtained for them perfectly. That is by the indication of the saying of \"Byas\" [Vyasa]: Know the twenty-five by way of verification, then profess whatever religion you wish, for you are saved inevitably. And by the indication of the coming of \"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva/Krishna] from the offspring of a \"Shudra\" (Vasudeva is usually Kshatriya/Yadava, text might imply something else or referring to a specific tradition) and his saying to Arjun «1»: Indeed Allah is capable of reward without injustice or favoritism. He counts evil as good if He is forgotten in it, and good as evil if He is mentioned in it and not forgotten, even if its doer is a \"Vaishya\" or a \"Shudra\" or a woman, let alone being a \"Brahmin\" or a \"Kshatriya\".",

Likewise, their kings used to do it. For \"Minos\", when he ruled over the islands of the sea and the \"Cretans\", and that was after the days of Moses by close to two hundred years, established laws for them claiming they were taken from \"Zeus\". In that time \"Minos\" established the laws. In the time of \"Darius\" the First, who was after \"Cyrus\", he sent messengers of the Romans to the people of \"Athens\", and they took the laws from them in twelve books, until \"Numa Pompilius\" ruled them and took charge of establishing the laws for them. He made the months of the year twelve after they had been ten for them. What indicates his compelling them is that he established their transactions with pottery and hides instead of silver, for that would be from rage at one who does not obey. In the first essay of the \"Book of Laws\" [The Laws] by Plato, the stranger from the people of Athens said: Who do you think was the cause of establishing laws for you? Is it some angel or some human? The \"Knossian\" (Clinias) said: It is some angel. As for in reality with us, it is Zeus. As for the people of \"Lacedaemon\", they claim that the establisher of laws for them is \"Apollo\". Then he said in this essay: It is obligatory on the establisher of laws, if he is from Allah, to make his purpose in establishing them the acquisition of the greatest virtues and the utmost justice.

The \"Athenian\" said in the second essay of this book: When the gods had mercy on the race of humans because it is molded on fatigue, they prepared for them festivals for the gods and for the Sekinas (Muses?), and for Apollo the manager of the \"Sekinas\", and for Dionysus the granter of wine to humans as a medicine for the astringency of old age, so they return young by forgetting melancholy and the transfer of the soul's character from hardship to safety. He also said: Indeed they inspired them «1» with the measures of dance and rhythm of even weight as a reward for fatigues, and so they become accustomed with them in festivals and joys. Therefore, a type of types of music in the symbol for the prayers of the gods was named \"Hymns\".\nThis was the condition of these people. Upon the like of it is the matter of the Indians. For they see the Sharia and its laws issuing from the \"Rishis\", the sages, the bases of religion, not the Messenger who is \"Narayan\" [Narayana/Vishnu] imaged upon his coming in the forms of humans. He will not come except to cut off the material of evil looming «2» over the world or to remedy a reality. There is no substitution in anything of the matter of laws; rather, you work «3» by them as you find them. For this reason, dispensing with messengers occurred among them in the chapter of law and worship, even if the need for them occurred in the interests of creation. As for their abrogation, it seems it is not impossible for them, because they claim that many things were permissible before the coming of \"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva/Krishna] then were forbidden, among them the meat of cows. That is due to the change of the natures of people and their inability to bear duties. Among them is the matter of marriages and lineages. For lineage at that time was on one of three types: One of them from the loins of the father in the womb of the wedded mother, as it is now with us and with them. The second from the loins of the son-in-law in the womb of the daughter conducted [to him] if it was stipulated that the child belongs to her father; so the child of the daughter then belongs to the stipulating grandfather, not the sowing father.

That is because there presented to this king, by the curse of some ascetics upon him, what prevented him from approaching his women, along with the lack of a child. So he asked \"Byas bin Parashar\" [Vyasa son of Parashara] to raise for him from his women a child to succeed him. He sent one of them to him. She feared him when she entered upon him and trembled, so she conceived from him, according to that condition, a sickly yellow one (Pandu). Then he sent the second to him. She was shy of him and veiled herself with her veil, so she gave birth to \"Dhritarashtra\", blind and unfit. He sent the third and advised her to reject awe and shyness. She entered laughing and rejoicing, and conceived \"Vidura\" who surpassed people in jest and cleverness. The four children of \"Pandu\" had a common wife among them who stayed with each one for a month. Indeed, in their books: \"Parashar\" the ascetic rode a boat in which the boatman had a daughter. He fell in love with her and seduced her «1» until she yielded, except that there was no screen on the shore from eyes. A \"Tamarisk\" grew immediately to facilitate the matter. He lay with her behind the tamarisk and impregnated her with his son, this virtuous \"Byas\". All of that is now annulled and abrogated. For this reason, the permissibility of abrogation is imagined from their speech. As for these scandals in marriages, some of it exists now and in the pasts of Ignorance (Jahiliyyah). For the inhabitants of the mountains extending from the region of \"Panjhir\" to near \"Kashmir\" make obligatory the gathering on one woman if they are brothers. The marriage of the Arabs in their Jahiliyyah was on types. Among them is that one of them would prescribe to his wife to send to So-and-so and seek intercourse from him, then he would avoid her during the days of her pregnancy out of desire for the nobility of the child. This is the third division of the Indians. Among them is that he would say to the other: get down from your wife for me and I will get down for you from my wife; so they do it by exchange. Among them is that a group would cover her, and when she delivered, she would attach him to his father; if she did not know him, the physiognomists would know him. Among them is \"Nikah al-Maqt\" (Marriage of Abomination) with the wife of the father or the son; the name of the child from it is \"Dayzan\". It is not far from the Jews, for it was prescribed upon them that a man marry the wife of his brother if he died and did not leave offspring, and generate for his deceased brother a progeny attributed to him not to himself, so his mention does not perish from the world. They call the doer of that in Hebrew \"Yabam\". Likewise...",

Due to its tranquility with the example, many of the people of creeds turned to imaging (representation) in books and temples, like the Jews and Christians «1», then the Manichaeans specifically. Sufficient witness to what I said is that if you showed the picture of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, or Mecca and the Kaaba to a commoner or a woman, you would find, from the result of joy in it, motives of kissing, dusting the cheeks, and rolling [in dust], as if he witnessed the imaged one and performed by that the rites of Hajj and Umrah. This is the cause motivating the creation of idols with the names of magnified persons from the prophets, scholars, and angels, reminding of their matter at absence and death, remaining as traces of their magnification in hearts upon loss, until the era became long for those who made them, and centuries and epochs revolved over them, and their causes and motives were forgotten, and they became a custom and a sunnah «2» used. Then the owners of laws entered them from their door since that was more imprinted in them, so they made them obligatory upon them. Thus the reports arrived regarding those who preceded the era of the Flood and those who came after it.

Then Romulus killed his brother. Earthquakes and wars followed successively after him until Romulus humbled himself, so he was shown in a dream that that would not calm down unless he seated his brother on the throne. So he made an image of gold and seated it with him. He used to say, \"We commanded such-and-such.\" The custom of kings after him ran on this address, and the earthquakes calmed. He took a feast and a playground to distract possessors of grudges regarding the brother. He set up four statues for the sun on four horses: the green one for the earth, the sky-blue for water, the red for fire, and the white for air. They remain standing in Rome until now.

He answered him: I am pleased to see you and grateful for what you offered of success and aid, but I do not ask from you but from Him who created you. \"Indra\" said: The purpose in worship is the good reward for it, so obtain the purpose from the one you found it from and do not critique saying 'not from you but from other than you'. The King said: As for the world, it has been obtained for me, and I have turned away from all that is in it. My intended purpose from worship is seeing the Lord, and it is not yours (in your power), so how can I ask my need from you?

I am among those who turned away from the world and turned to worship. I am not leaving it as long as I am alive. I do not know a sin for myself for which I deserve killing from you. If you are doing it without a crime from me, then [do] your affair and what you want. However, if my intention is pure for Allah and my certainty is not mixed with impurity, you will not be able to harm me. What you distracted me with from worship is enough for me. He returned to it. When he began it, the Lord appeared to him in the form of a human of the color of the dark blue water lily (Nilotpala), in yellow clothing, riding the bird named \"Garuda\". In one of his four hands was \"Shankha\", which is the conch shell blown on the backs of elephants.

I do not want after it other than liberation from this bond. The Lord said: It is by abandoning the world in solitude «2» and holding fast to thought and withdrawing the senses to yourself.

Man must have food and clothing, and they are connectors between him and the world, so is there other than that?

He said: 'I have done so and have inspired \"Vasistha\" your judge with everything needed, so rely on him for the issues.' Then the figure disappeared from his sight. The King returned to his seat and did what he was commanded. They said: From that time on, idols were made, some with four hands as we described, and some with two hands, according to the story and description and according to the owner of the image. They also reported that Brahma had a son named \"Narada\" who had no ambition other than seeing the Lord. It was his custom in his wanderings to hold a staff with him; when he threw it down, it would become a snake, and he would perform wonders with it, and it never left him. While he was contemplating his desire, he saw a light from afar. He headed towards it and was called from it: 'What you ask and wish for is impossible to exist, for you cannot see me except like this.' He looked, and behold, there was a luminous figure in the likeness of human figures. From that time on, idols were established with forms. Among the famous idols is the idol of \"Multan\" [Multan, Pakistan] in the name of the Sun, and for that reason, it was called \"Aditya\". It was made of wood covered with red Cordovan leather, and in its eyes were two red rubies. They claim that it was made in the earlier \"Krita Yuga\". Suppose it was at the end of that time, then from it to us is 216,432 years. When Muhammad bin Qasim bin al-Munabbih conquered Multan, he looked into the reason for its prosperity and the wealth gathered therein, and he found that idol, as it was a destination visited from every direction. He saw it prudent to leave it, after hanging cow meat on its neck in mockery of it, and he built a congregational mosque there. When the \"Qarmatians\" took over Multan, \"Jalam ibn Shayban\", the usurper, broke that idol, killed its custodians, and made its house, which was a palace built of baked brick on a high place, into a congregational mosque instead of the first mosque, which he closed out of hatred for what was built in the days of the Umayyads.

So how could the wood remain for that duration given the humidity of the air and the earth there! And Allah knows best. The city of \"Taneshar\" (Thanesar) [Thanesar, India] is venerated among them. Its idol was called \"Chakrasvamin\", meaning the owner of the Chakra, which is a weapon we have described. It is made of copper, close in size to the size of a human. It is now thrown in the hippodrome in Ghazna [Ghazni, Afghanistan] along with the head of \"Somnath\", which is a representation of the genitalia of \"Mahadeva\" (Shiva). This image is called \"Linga\". The news of Somnath will come in its place. As for Chakrasvamin, they said: It was made in the days of \"Bharata\" as a memorial of those wars. Inside \"Kashmir\" [Kashmir], a journey of two or three days from the capital towards the mountains of \"Bolor\" [Gilgit-Baltistan], there is a wooden idol house called \"Sharada\" which is venerated and visited. We mention the summaries of a chapter from the book \"Samhita\" regarding the making of idols, which aids in knowing what we are discussing. \"Varahamihira\" said: If the image made is for Rama son of Dasaratha or for Bali son of Virochana, make the height one hundred and twenty digits of the idol's digits. For others, reduce that by a tenth, meaning one hundred and eight. Make the hands of the idol of \"Vishnu\" eight, or four, or two. On his left side under the breast is the image of the woman \"Sri\" (Lakshmi). If you make him with eight hands, place in the right a sword, in the second a mace of gold or iron, in the third an arrow, and the fourth as if scooping water. In the left, a shield, a bow, a Chakra (discus), and a conch. If you make him with four, drop the bow and arrow. If you make him with two hands, let the right be scooping and in the left a conch. If the image is \"Baladeva\", the brother of \"Narayana\", put earrings in his ears and make his eyes intoxicated. If you make both images, join with them their sister \"Bhagavati\" (Ekanamsha), her left hand on her hip, turning away from...",

If you make the Seven Mothers, group them together. \"Brahmani\" has four faces in the four directions. \"Kaumari\" has six faces. \"Vaishnavi\" has four hands. \"Varahi\" has a head like a boar's head on a human body. \"Indrani\" has many eyes and a mace in her hand. \"Bhagavati\" is sitting as is customary. \"Chamunda\" is deformed, with protruding fangs and a shrunken belly. Then join to them the two sons of \"Mahadeva\": \"Kshetrapala\" with bristling hair, a grim face, and deformed appearance; and \"Vinayaka\" (Ganesha) whose head is the head of an elephant on a human body with four hands as previously mentioned. Near the group of these idols, sheep and buffaloes are killed with Kataras (daggers) so they may feed on their blood. All idols have measurements in their digits determined for their limbs, and perhaps there is disagreement in some of them. If the maker maintains them and does not add or subtract, he is far from sin and safe from the owner of the image causing him harm. If he makes the idol one cubit and with its throne two cubits, he attains safety and fertility. If he increases upon that, it is praiseworthy, provided he knows that excessive largeness of the idol, especially the idol of the Sun, is harmful to the ruler, and its smallness is harmful to its maker. Shrinking its belly brings continuous hunger to the region, and making it emaciated destroys wealth. If the hand of the maker slips so that he makes a mark on it like a blow, a blow will also occur on his body by which he will be killed. If he falls short in leveling so that one of its shoulders rises above the other, his wife will perish. If he turns its eye upwards, he will go blind in his life, or if downwards, his worries and anxieties will increase. When the sculpted idol is of one of the gems, it is better than wood, and wood is better than clay. For the benefits of the gem encompass the men of the kingdom and its women.

Likewise, the \"Linga\" that \"Rama\" set up upon finishing the battle with the demons was of sand he piled up with his hand, which petrified quickly because the chosen time for setting it up preceded the workers' finishing of the carving of the stone one he had ordered. As for building its house and the portico around it, cutting trees of specific kinds, choosing the time for setting it up, and establishing the rituals for it, it is a matter that is long and tedious. Then he ordered the establishment of servants and custodians for it from various sects. For the image of \"Vishnu\", the sect of \"Bhagavata\"; for the image of the Sun, the sect of \"Maga\", i.e., the Magians; for the image of \"Mahadeva\", the sect of \"Uragara\" (or similar ascetics), who are ascetics that grow their hair long, smear their skins with ash, hang the bones of the dead on themselves, and wander in the thickets. For the Eight Mothers, the \"Brahmins\". For Buddha, the \"Shramanas\". For \"Arhant\", the sect of \"Nagna\" (naked ones). In summary, for every idol, there are people who formed it, for they are more guided to its service. The purpose of recounting this nonsense was to know the image from its idol if seen, and to verify what we said that these idols are set up for the common people whose ranks are low and whose knowledge is short. For no idol was ever made in the name of One who is above matter, let alone Allah the Almighty. And to know how the low-minded are enslaved by delusions. Therefore, it is said in the book \"Gita\": 'Many people draw near to Me in their desires through other than Me, and seek means through charities, glorification, and prayer to other than Me; so I strengthen them upon it, grant them success in it, and bring them to their will because of My independence from them.' And in it also, \"Basudeva\" (Krishna) said to Arjuna: 'Do you not see that most of the hopeful ones address in sacrifices and service the genera of spiritual beings, the Sun, the Moon, and other luminaries? If Allah does not disappoint their hopes due to His independence from them, and increases upon their request and gives them that from the direction they intended, they turn to worshipping their intended ones due to the shortness of their knowledge of Him, while He is the one completing their matters in this mode of intermediation.

    "text": "...and intermediaries, as it is according to merit. Permanence is only for what is attained through Allah alone when one becomes weary of old age, death, and birth.' This is what is in the speech of Basudeva. These ignorant people, if they find success by chance or determination, and added to that is some trickery of the custodians by collusion, their veils (of ignorance) strengthen, not their insights, and they rush to those images, destroying their own forms before them by shedding their blood and mutilating themselves in front of them. The Greeks in ancient times used to place idols as intermediaries between themselves and the First Cause, and worshipped them with the names of the stars and the high substances, since they did not describe the First Cause with anything of affirmation, but rather by negating opposites to honor and exalt Him; so how could they intend Him for worship! When the Arabs transported idols from Sham (Syria) to their land, they worshipped them likewise to bring them closer to Allah. Here is Plato saying in the fourth treatise of the book \"The Laws\": 'It is obligatory upon he who gives complete honors to set up idols for the gods and the Shekinahs with a secret (mystery), and not to prioritize specific idols for the ancestral gods. Then the honors for parents if they are alive, for it is the greatest of duties according to ability.' He means by the 'secret' the 'mention' (Dhikr) in the special sense, which is a term frequently used among the \"Harranian Sabians\", the \"Manichaean Dualists\", and the theologians of India. Galen said in the book \"Ethics of the Soul\": 'In the time of \"Commodus\" one of the Caesars, which is close to five hundred and some years ago (from Galen's time), two men came to an idol seller in Alexandria and bargained with him for an idol of \"Hermes\". One of them wanted to set it up in a temple to be a memorial for Hermes, and the other wanted to set it up on a grave to remember the deceased by it. Neither trade was concluded, so they delayed his matter to the next day. The idol seller saw in his sleep that night as if the idol was speaking to him and saying: \"O virtuous man! I am your creation. I have benefited from the work of your hands a form attributed to a star (planet), so the attribute of stoniness by which I was named before has departed from me, and I became known as Mercury. So the matter is up to you now in making me a memorial for something that does not corrupt or for something that has corrupted.\"' There is a letter by Aristotle in response to questions from the Brahmins sent to him by Alexander...",

This was an elevation by him above the rank of the stupid and the commoners, and a demonstration from himself that he does not occupy himself with that. It has been known that the primary cause in this affliction is remembrance and consolation, then it increased until it reached the corrupt and corrupting rank. Mu'awiyah went to the first cause regarding the idols of \"Sicily\" [Sicily, Italy] when it was conquered in the year fifty-three in the summer expedition. He carried from it gold idols crowned and encrusted with gems, and sent them to \"Sind\" [Sindh, Pakistan] to be sold there to their kings, for he saw selling them as objects worth a dinar for a dinar, and turned away from the latter affliction in the judgment of governance, not religion.",

It is speech they attributed to Allah the Almighty from the mouth of \"Brahma\". The \"Brahmins\" recite it as a recitation without understanding its meaning. They learn it likewise among themselves, one taking it from another. Then, only a few of them learn its interpretation, and fewer than that are those who engage in its meanings and interpretations by way of examination and debate. They teach it to the \"Kshatriya\", so he learns it without being permitted to teach it, even to a Brahmin. Then it is not lawful for a Vaisya or a Sudra to hear it, let alone pronounce it and read it. If that is proven against one of them, the Brahmins hand him over to the ruler, who punishes him by cutting off the tongue. The Veda contains commands, prohibitions, encouragement, and intimidation with specification, designation, reward, and punishment. Most of it is on hymns and fire sacrifices of types that can hardly be counted due to number and difficulty. They do not allow writing it down because it is read with melodies, so they refrain from the inability of the pen and its causing addition or subtraction in the written text. For this reason, it was lost to them several times. For they claim that in the addresses of Allah the Almighty with Brahma in the beginning, according to what \"Shaunaka\" narrated - transmitted by the planet Venus from him: 'You will forget the \"Veda\" at the time when the earth drowns, and it will go to its bottom. No one will be able to bring it out except the Fish, so send it so it hands it over to you; and send the Boar so it lifts the earth with its tusks and brings it out of the water.'

In \"Vishnu Purana\": It is renewed at the beginning of every time of the \"Manvantara\", the owner of a turn whose children own all the earth, and a chief who heads the world, and angels for whom people perform fire sacrifices, and the \"Daughters of Na'sh\" (Ursa Major/Seven Rishis) renew the perished Veda at the end of every turn. For that reason, near our time, \"Vasukra\" the Kashmiri, one of the eminent Brahmins, volunteered to interpret the Veda and preserve it in writing. He bore the burden of sin that others refrained from out of fear that it would be forgotten and lost from memories, and that was when he saw the corruption of people's intentions and their lack of desire for good, indeed for duty. Then they claim that there are places in it that are not read in settlements for fear of causing miscarriages in pregnant women and animals, so they go out to the desert to read them. No assigned text is free from such scaremongering. We had previously presented regarding their books that they are measured by meters like Rajaz poems, and most of them are in a meter called \"Sloka\" for the reason we presented. Galen approves of this and says in the book \"De Compositione Medicamentorum\" (On the Composition of Drugs): 'Single letters for the weights of medicines are corrupted by copying and are also corrupted by the obscuring of the envious. For this reason, \"Democritus\" deserved that his books on medicines be chosen, their matter publicized, and praised because they are written in measured poetry in Greek, for that would be beautiful.' This is because prose is more susceptible to corruption than verse. The \"Veda\" is not on that common meter, but on a meter other than it. Some of them say: It is miraculous; no one among them can compose the like of it. The verifying scholars among them claim that this is within their power, but they are prohibited from it out of respect for it. They said: \"Vyasa\" divided it into four parts: \"Rigveda\", \"Yajurveda\", \"Samaveda\", and \"Atharvaveda\". He had four \"Shishyas\", meaning students, and he taught each one one part or burdened him with it. They are, in the order of the mentioned parts: \"Paila\", \"Vaisampayana\", \"Jaimini\", \"Sumantu\". For each of the...",

Rigveda was named by it as if it is the collection of Ric. It contains fire sacrifices. It is read with three types of reading: one is evenly like the custom in all readings; the second is by stopping at every single word; and the third, which is the best of them and promised abundant reward, is to read a small segment of it with known words, repeat it, add something from the unread to it, then repeat this added part alone, read it, and add another to it, and continue doing this so the recited text is repeated upon its completion. As for \"Yajurveda\", its verse is composed of \"Kandali\" (Kandika?), and its name is derived from it, meaning the collection of Kandali. The difference between it and the first is that this one can be read continuously, while it is not possible in the first. It contains what is in that one of fire works and sacrifices. I heard regarding the reason for the separation of \"Rigveda\" from continuity in reading that \"Yajnavalkya\" was with his teacher, and the teacher had a Brahmin companion who wanted to travel. He asked him to send someone to his house to establish the conditions for \"Homa\", meaning his fire, and preserve it from extinguishing during his absence. The teacher used to send his students there by turn. Yajnavalkya's turn came, and he was handsome in appearance, clean in dress. When he started what he was sent for in the presence of the absent man's wife, she disliked his adornment. Yajnavalkya sensed what she concealed. When he finished and took water in his hand to sprinkle it on the woman's head—for that stands in place of blowing (spitting lightly) after supplication, as blowing is disliked and impure among them—the woman said: 'Sprinkle it on that pillar.' He did so, and the pillar turned green immediately. The woman regretted her excess and came to the teacher the second day asking him to send the one sent yesterday. Yajnavalkya refused to go except in his turn. Persistence did not work on him, and he did not care about the teacher's anger, but he said to him: 'Take back from me what you taught me.' When he said that, he was made to forget what he knew. He went to the Sun and asked him to teach him the \"Veda\". The Sun said: 'How is that possible with my perpetual motion and your inability to do the like!' So Yajnavalkya clung to the wheel of the Sun and began learning the Veda from him, and was forced to break up the reading due to the disturbance in the movement of the wheel. As for \"Samaveda\"...",

The reason for its melodies is that \"Narayana\", when he came in the form of \"Vamana\" and came to King \"Bali\", made himself a \"Brahmin\" and began reading Samaveda with a melodious tune that enchanted him until his affair happened as it did. As for \"Atharva\", it is continuous, not from the first two verses, but from a third called \"Bhara\", and is read with a melody with nasalization. People's desire for it is less. It also contains fire sacrifices and commands regarding the dead and what must be done with them. As for the \"Puranas\", and the interpretation of \"Purana\" is the First Ancient, they are eighteen. Most of them are named after animals, humans, and angels because they contain their news or because the speech in them or the answer to questions is attributed to them.

The second is \"Aranya\", which is going out to the desert by the departure of the children of \"Pandu\". The third is \"Virata\", which is the name of a king in whose kingdom they were during the time of hiding. The fourth is \"Udyoga\", which is preparation for fighting. The fifth is \"Bhishma\". The sixth is \"Drona\" the Brahmin. The seventh is \"Karna son of the Sun\". The eighth is \"Shalya\" brother of \"Duryodhana\". These are among the great brave ones who took charge of the fighting one after the killing of the other. The ninth is \"Gada\", which is the mace. The tenth is \"Sauptika\", which is the killing of the sleepers when \"Ashvatthama son of Drona\" attacked the city of \"Panchala\" at night and killed its people. The eleventh is \"Jalapradanika\", which is giving water in the name of the dead, scoop by scoop, and that is after washing from the impurity of handling and touching them. The twelfth is \"Stri\", which is the wailing of women. The thirteenth is \"Shanti\", twenty-four thousand \"Slokas\" on removing rancor from hearts, and it is four sections: \"Rajadharma\" on the reward of kings, \"Danadharma\" on the reward of charities, \"Apaddharma\" on the reward of the distressed and tested, and \"Mokshadharma\" on the reward of the one liberated from the world. The fourteenth is \"Asvamedha\", which is the sacrifice of the horse sent out with the army to roam the world, and it is proclaimed over it that it belongs to the King of the World, and whoever refuses that let him come forth, and the \"Brahmins\" follow it to establish fire sacrifices at its stopping places. The fifteenth is \"Mausala\", which is the mutual killing of \"Yadu\", the tribe of \"Basudeva\". The sixteenth is \"Asramavasika\", meaning leaving the homeland. The seventeenth is \"Prasthana\" (Mahaprasthanika), which is leaving the kingdom to seek salvation. The eighteenth is \"Svargarohana\", which is rising towards Paradise. Following these eighteen is one other part called \"Harivamsa Parva\", containing the news of \"Basudeva\". In this book, there are passages like riddles, bearing in the language...",

We are not guided to anything of it because it is a branch of a root we lack, I mean the language itself. What I heard of the names of their books in this chapter is: The book \"Aindra\", attributed to \"Indra\" the head of the angels; the book \"Candra\", made by \"Candra\" who was one of the Red-Robed ones, the companions of Buddha; the book \"Sakata\" (Sakatayana) by the name of its author, and his tribe is also called by it \"Sakatayana\"; the book \"Panini\" by the name of its author; the book \"Katantra\" made by \"Sarvavarman\"; the book \"Shisya-hita-vritti\" made by \"Ugrabhuti\"; the book \"Durgavritti\"; and the book \"Shishyahitavritti\" made by \"Ugrabhuti\". It was told to me that this man was the tutor of the Shah in our time, \"Anandapala son of Jayapala\", and his instructor. When he made this book, he sent it to \"Kashmir\" [Kashmir], but its people did not pay attention to it due to their pride in that (field) and their arrogance. So the man complained about that to the Shah, who guaranteed him, by the right of discipleship, to achieve his desire.

They said regarding the origin of this science: One of their kings, named \"Samalvahana\", and in eloquent speech \"Satavahana\", was one day in a pool playing with his wives. He said to one of them: \"Ma udakam dehi\", meaning 'Do not sprinkle water on me'. She thought he said: \"Modakam dehi\", meaning 'Bring sweets'. So she went and came with it. The King denied her action, and she was harsh in reply and rough in speech. The King became distressed by that and abstained from food as per their custom, and secluded himself until one of their scholars came to him and consoled him by promising to teach him grammar and the inflections of speech. That scholar went to \"Mahadeva\" praying, glorifying, fasting, and supplicating until he appeared to him and gave him simple rules, just as Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali established in Arabic, and promised him support in what follows of the branches. The scholar returned to the King and taught him them, and that was the beginning of this science. Following it is \"Chandas\", which is the measure of poetry corresponding to the science of Prosody. They cannot dispense with it because their books are in verse, and their intent in that is to make memorization easy. They do not refer to the book in sciences except out of necessity. That is because the soul yearns for everything that has proportion and order and is disgusted by what has no order. For this reason, you see most Indians raving about their poetry and eager to read it even if they do not know its meaning, and they snap their fingers in joy with it and approval of it, and they do not desire prose even if its knowledge is easy. Most of their books are \"Slokas\". We are in trials from it in what I translate for the Indians from the book of \"Euclid\" and the \"Almagest\" and what I dictate on the craft of the Astrolabe to them, out of my eagerness to spread knowledge and that what they do not have falls to them. They busy themselves with making them into Slokas where the meaning is not understood because the verse necessitates affectation which becomes clear when we mention their numbers. Otherwise, I would confront them with writing it as it is in prose, and they would be alienated; may Allah grant me justice from them. The first to extract this art were \"Pingala\" and \"Chalit\" (?). The books made in this chapter are many. The most famous is the book \"Gitam\" (?) by the name of its author so that prosody is also nicknamed by it, and the book \"Mrigalanchan\", and the book \"Pingala\", and the book \"Oliyand\" (?). I have not seen any of them nor much of the treatise in \"Brahmasiddhanta\" regarding its calculation such that I can verify the laws of their prosody.

In counting letters, they depict something similar to what Al-Khalil bin Ahmad and the prosodists among us depicted for the quiescent and the moving (consonants/vowels), and they are these two forms: [Symbol]. The first, which is on the left because their writing is so, is called \"Laghu\" (Light) - |, and the second which is on the right is \"Guru\" (Heavy) - S. Its measure in estimation is that it is double the first; nothing fills its place except two of the Light. Among their letters are what is also called Long (Dirgha), and its measure is the measure of the Heavy. I think they are the ones whose quiescents (sukoon) are defective (vowels). Although I am until now not certain of the state of the Light and Heavy such that I can represent them in Arabic, the most likely opinion is that the first is not a quiescent (sukoon) and the second is not a moving (vowel), but rather the first is a moving only (short vowel) and the second is a combination of moving and quiescent (long vowel/closed syllable) like the 'Sabab' in our prosody. I only doubt the matter because of what I find of them gathering a large number of consecutive signs of Light, and the Arabs do not combine two quiescents, while that is possible in other languages. These are what the prosodists of Persian called moving letters of light movement, for exceeding three of them is difficult for the speaker, indeed pronouncing them is impossible, and they do not flow like the flow of combined moving letters in our saying: \"Badanuka kamithli sifatika wa famuka bi-sa'ati shafatik\" (Your body is like your description and your mouth is the width of your lip). Also, due to the difficulty of starting with a quiescent, most Indian names start with what is not quiescent, so it is from the hidden movements. If the beginning of the verse is like that, they drop that letter from the count because the condition of the Heavy is that its quiescent follows, not precedes. Then I say, just as our companions made form 'Fa-a-la' (Arabic meter roots) molds for the structures of poetry and numbers for the moving and quiescent among them to express the meter, likewise the Indians named what is composed of Light and Heavy by advancing and delaying and keeping the measure in estimation without counting the letters, titles by which they indicate the assumed meter. I mean by estimation that \"Laghu\" is one Matra, meaning measure, and \"Guru\" is two Matras. So attention is not paid to the count in writing without estimation, just as the stressed letter (Shaddah) is counted as a quiescent and a moving, and the Tanween (nunation) as a moving and a quiescent, even if each of them is one in writing. As for the two individually, the Light is called...",

The verse is divided into three feet and four, which is the most common. Perhaps a fifth foot is added in the middle.

We burdened ourselves with that so that the condition of the \"Shloka\" [Sloka] is established by it, because the structures of books are upon it. So we say: It is of those possessing four feet, each one having eight letters. They are not similar in the feet. The ends of the four are of one genus, which is the Heavy [Guru]. One of its conditions is that the fifth letter in all its feet be light [Laghu] always, and the sixth in them be heavy, and the seventh in each of the second and fourth feet be light, and in the remaining two heavy. Then the rest of the letters are however they happened or were intended. In order that the manner of using calculation in it be known, we say, narrating from \"Brahmagupta\": Indeed the first of the genera of poetry is \"Gayatri\", and it possesses two feet. If we assume the number of letters of this genus to be twenty-four, and the minimum number of letters of the foot to be four, the two feet would be thus: 4:4 on the minimum possible. But the assumed for them is 24, so the remainder 16 we add to the right foot until they become 20:4. If it were possessing three feet, it would be 16:4:4, for the right foot is distinguished always, named by a name separately, and what is before it of the feet are combined as one sentence and named by a name separately. If it were possessing four feet, it would be 12:4:4:4. If we do not work on the four which is the minimum possible in the foot, and we wanted the pairings occurring in the one with two feet from the twenty-four letters, we add one to the left foot and subtract one from the right, and place the two results under them, each one in its side. One continues to do that until ending at the like of the two numbers which are in the beginning of the two lines, exchanged, on the example of this image: [Table/Image]. The number of these pairings is seventeen, like the difference between the first two numbers with one added to it.

For Galen says in the book \"Katagenes\": Indeed the medicine made with the juices which \"Menecrates\" extracted, \"Democrates\" described it in measured poetry possessing three hemistichs.",

Its sign is the desire of people for them and their honoring of them and of their people, and those most worthy of that are those who follow them. For its action empties the hearts occupied with the necessities of the world and shakes «1» the sides for increase of praise and satisfaction. For hearts are molded on the love of that and the hatred of its opposite. Our time is not of the mentioned description, but of its opposite, inevitably. So when will a science grow in it or a grower develop? What exists in it are only remnants and dregs from the times that were on that description. If a thing encompasses the earth, every sect on it takes its share, and the Indians are one of them. Their belief regarding the regression of days accords with what is found by viewing. The science of astronomy among them is more famous due to the connection of the matters of the religion with it. He who does not know the judgments (astrology) among them, the attribute of astronomy does not apply to him by mere calculation. What our companions know as \"Sindhind\" is \"Siddhanta\", meaning the Straight that does not become crooked nor change. This name applies to everything whose rank is high among them of the science of the calculation of stars, even if it is deficient with us compared to our Zijes (astronomical tables). It is five: One of them is \"Surya Siddhanta\" attributed to the Sun, undertaken by \"Lata\". The second is \"Vasishtha Siddhanta\" attributed to one of the stars of the Great Bear (Ursa Major), made by \"Vishnuchandra\".

The fifth is \"Brahma Siddhanta\" attributed to Brahm, made by \"Brahmagupta bin Jishnu\" in the city of \"Bhillamala\" [Bhinmal], which is between \"Multan\" and \"Anhilvara\" sixteen \"Yojanas\". All of them rely on the book of \"Pitamaha\" attributed to the First Father, who is Brahm. \"Varahamihira\" made a small-sized Zij named \"Pancha Siddhantika\". The name necessitates its containing what is in the five, but it is not so. Then it is not better than them so that it could be said it is the most correct of the five; rather the name establishes the five for their number. Then \"Brahmagupta\" says: Indeed the Siddhantas are many; among them is \"Surya\", and among them is \"Indu\", and among them is \"Paulisa\", and among them is \"Romaka\", and among them is \"Vasishtha\", and among them is \"Yavana\", meaning the Greek. Despite their multitude, they do not differ except in wording, not in meaning. Whoever contemplates them with true contemplation knows their agreement. I have not obtained until now a copy except that of Paulisa and that of Brahmagupta, without their translation having been completed for me yet. I mention the index of the chapters of \"Brahma Siddhanta\" for that is beneficial in knowledge: 1. On the conditions of the globe and the form of the heaven and the earth. 2. On the cycles of the planets and the manipulation of times and extracting the mean motions of the planets and making sines for arcs. 3. On the true positions of the planets. 4.

On the eclipse of the sun. 9. On the shadow of the moon. 10. On the conjunction of planets and their association. 11. On the latitudes of the planets. 12. On the criticism of what is in the books and Zijes and distinguishing the correct from the incorrect. 13. On arithmetic and its manipulation in areas and other things. 14. On verifying the mean motions of the planets. 15. On verifying the true positions of the planets. 16. On verifying the three questions. 17. On the deviations of the eclipse. 18.

I did not mention it here because the causes are removed by calculation. I think that what he pointed to is the proofs of the operations, otherwise when is anything extracted from this art without calculation? Everything that falls below the rank of \"Siddhanta\" is called mostly either \"Tantra\" or \"Karana\". As for Tantra, its meaning is what is disposed under the hand of the worker. As for Karana, its meaning is the follower, meaning of the Siddhanta. Also, its workers are the \"Acharyas\", meaning the ascetic scholars, and they are followers of Brahm. Each of \"Aryabhata\" and \"Balabhadra\" has a known \"Tantra\". And \"Bhanuyasas\" has the book \"Rasayana Tantra\"; and Rasayana is explained in its chapter. As for \"Karana\", it is attributed to his name. For Brahmagupta is \"Karana Khandakhadyaka\". This is a name for a type of sweetmeat among them. I heard regarding the reason for naming it that, that \"Sugriva the Buddhist\" made a Zij he named \"Dadhigrah\" [Dadhigram?], meaning the Ocean of \"Mast\" (Yogurt). A student of his made a Zij he named \"Kurubabya\" [?], meaning a Mountain of Rice. Then he made \"Lavanamushti\", meaning a Handful of Salt. Therefore, \"Brahmagupta\" named his book Sweetmeat to complete the meal. What is in it is according to the opinion of \"Aryabhata\". Therefore, he followed it with a book he named \"Uttara Khandakhadyaka\", meaning its verification. Another book follows it; I do not verify if it is his or another's, called \"Khandakhadyaka Tippa\", containing the causes of the numbers used in it and what they are, although I strongly suspect it is by Balabhadra. For \"Vijayananda\" the Commentator in the city of \"Varanasi\" is a Zij known as \"Karana Tilaka\", meaning the Blaze of the Followers. And for \"Viteshvara bin Mahadatta\" from the city of \"Nagarapura\" is a Zij he named \"Karana Sara\", meaning the Extracted from the Followers. And for \"Bhanuyasas\" is the book \"Karana Para Tilaka\", by which, they claimed, the true positions of the planets are extracted from each other. And for \"Utpala\" the Kashmiri \"Rahunrakarana\" [?], meaning the Breaker of the Followers, and \"Karana Pata\", meaning the Killer of the Followers, and \"Karana Chudamani\"; and I do not know its author.

    "text": "15 - Mentioning Knowledge of their Measurements so mentioning them becomes easy during the speech\nEnumeration is imprinted in the human being. A thing becomes known in magnitude if it is added to what is named of its genus as 'one' by convention. By that, the difference between it and another that is of its genus becomes known. As for weight, by it the amount of heaviness is known from the perspective of transport when the column of the instrument is parallel to the horizon. The Indians rarely need a balance because their Dirhams are numerical (counted), and their fractions by Fuls (copper coins) are also counted. The dies of both are different such that they are attributed by them to their cities and borders. They only weigh gold with the balance, stamped or stamped non-minted. They use in it a measure they call \"Suvarna\". Three-quarters of it is called \"Tola\". Their usage of Tola is frequent, analogous to our usage of the Mithqal. According to what I knew of it from their side, it balances of our Dirhams by the weight of seven, three Dirhams (meaning 7 Tolas = 3 Dirhams? Or relation 7:3? Likely text corruption or specific context). So the Tola of our Mithqals is two Mithqals and a tenth of a Mithqal. The greatest parts of the Tola are twelve, and they are called \"Mashas\". For the Suvarna, it is sixteen Mashas. Each Masha of it is four \"Andi\", which is the seed of a tree called \"Karu\" [?]. Each Andi is four \"Java\" (Barleycorn). Each Java is six \"Kala\", and a quarter Kala «1». Each Kala is four \"Pada\". Each Pada is four \"Mudri\" [?]. So then in every Suvarna there are 16 Mashas, 64 Andis, 256 Javas, 1600 Kalas, 6400 Padas, 25600 Mudris. Every six of the Mashas is called \"Drakshma\" [Dramma/Drachma?].

So Drakshma is like the Mithqal and like a quarter of a fifth. It is as if the answerer intended the Mithqal due to approximation, so he expressed it as its double. After that approximation, and because the One is not One in reality in these things, but rather it is a quantity agreed upon for its unity, it accepts division in action and imagination. Its parts differ in places at one time, and in times at one place. Their names change in them upon the variation of the original languages and their accidental change. Some who lived near \"Somnath\" mentioned: That their Mithqal is our Mithqal, and it is divided into eight \"Ruva\" [?]. Each Ruva is \"Palan «1»\". Each Pala is sixteen \"Java\", meaning barleycorn. So the Mithqal then is eight Ruvas, sixteen Palas, and two hundred «2» and fifty-six «3» barleycorns. It is known from this that he erred in equalizing between the magnitudes of the two Mithqals, and that what they have is \"Tola\", and he provided another name for the Masha, which is Ruva. Whoever was arbitrary in this chapter, he claimed according to what \"Varahamihira\" mentioned in the estimation of the making of idols: That every ten dust particles «4», and its name is \"Renu\", is called \"Raja\". Every eight Rajas is «5» \"Balagra\", which is the tip of the hair. Eight of it is \"Liksha\" «6», which is the nit in the hair. Eight of it is \"Yuka\", which is the louse. Every eight lice is a Java, meaning a barleycorn. He goes from it there to the estimation of distance. As for in weights, he agrees with what preceded and says: Indeed every four barleycorns is \"Andi\". Every four Andis is \"Masha\". Every sixteen Mashas is \"Suvarna\", which is gold. Every four Suvarnas is \"Pala\". As for in dry things, every four \"Pala\" is \"Kudava\". Every four Kudavas is \"Prastha\". Every four Prasthas is \"Adhaka\".

I do not think it is anything but corrupt, like the corruption of the rest of the things I know. For this, in our script, is necessary, especially with the people of our time who do not care for correcting what they copy. He said: \"Atreya\" said that six atoms, meaning dust particles, are \"Marichi\". Six Marichis are a mustard seed. Eight mustard seeds are a red rice grain. Two red rice grains are a great bean (Masha?). Two beans are \"Andi\", which is an eighth of a Daniq, given that the Dirham is seven Daniqs. Four Andis are \"Masha\". Eight Mashas are \"Shana\". Two Shanas are \"Karsha\", which is \"Suvarna\", and it weighs two Dirhams. Four Suvarnas are Pala. Four Palas are Kudava. Four Kudavas are Prastha. Four Prasthas are Adhaka. Four Adhakas are Drona. Two Dronas are \"Surpa\" «1». Two Surpas «1» are \"Goni\". The magnitude of Pala is used in the transactions of India, except that it is different in commodities and in countries also. They say it is a third of a fifth of a \"Mana\". Then there is one who claims it is fourteen Mithqals, while the Mana is not two hundred and ten Mithqals. And one who says it is sixteen, while the Mana is not two hundred and forty Mithqals. And one who says it is fifteen Dirhams, while the \"Mana\" is not two hundred and twenty-five Dirhams, unless its number in the Mana or the number of the Mana from it is other than that. From the saying of Atreya: \"Adhaka\" would be sixty-four \"Pala\" and one hundred and twenty-eight Dirhams, and that balances the Ratl. But \"Andi\", when it is an eighth of a Daniq, the \"Suvarna\" contains sixty-four of it, so the share of the Dirham according to him is thirty-two. If they were eighths of Daniqs, they are four Daniqs, and its double is a Dirham and a third, falling short of two Dirhams. This is from the results of guessing in translation and mixing different opinions without knowledge. As for the first saying based on Suvarna being three Dirhams of our Dirhams, and they did not disagree that it is a quarter of a Pala, it would be twelve Dirhams. If it was a third of a fifth of the Mana, it would be one hundred and eighty Dirhams. This creates the illusion that Suvarna is three Mithqals of our Mithqals, not Dirhams. \"Varahamihira\" said in another place of \"Samhita\": Make a round vessel whose diameter is a cubit and its depth...",

This is said by approximation because Adhaka, according to what preceded of its definition, is seven hundred and sixty-eight, either Dirhams as they said, or Mithqals as «2» I inferred. \"Sripala\" narrated from Varahamihira: That fifty Palas are two hundred and fifty-six Dirhams, and that is Adhaka. He erred in the narration; these are not Dirhams, but rather the number of what is in Adhaka of Suvarna. What is in it of Pala is sixty-four, not fifty. As for the detailing of \"Jivasharman\" of these measures according to what I heard from him: Four \"Pala\" is \"Kudava\". Four Kudavas is \"Prastha\". Four Prasthas is \"Adhaka\". Four Adhakas is \"Drona\". Twenty Dronas is \"Khari\". Before this, it must be known that sixteen \"Masha\" is \"Suvarna\". If the weight is for wheat and barley, then four Suvarnas is Pala. If it is for water and oil, then eight Suvarnas is «3» Pala. The balances of India for commodities are \"Steelyards\" (Qarastunat) with fixed weights and moveable hangers on numbers and lines. The balance of them is called \"Tula\". The beginnings of the lines in them are for the units of weight up to five, then after the five it becomes ten, then twenty, stepping down ten by ten. They claim the reason for that is the saying of \"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva/Krishna]: I will not kill \"Shishupala\", the son of my maternal aunt, without a crime, and I will pardon «4» him up to ten, then I will punish him. We will mention his story later. \"Al-Fazari\" used in his Zij the name Pala in place of the minutes of days. I did not find a mention of it in the books of the people except that they name the modification (Equation) by it. They have a measure in weight called \"Bhara\". Its mention comes in the battles and conquests of \"Sindh\". It is obtained from two thousand Palas, because they say it is a hundred times twenty «5» Palas. It is as if it is the load of an ox.

If the two measured things are of one genus, they are, with their equality in volume, equal in weight. If their genera differ, nothing but the equality of the two bulks is obtained. They have a measure they call \"Sibi\" [?] «1». Each of the \"Kannaujis\" and \"Somnathis\" mentioned it. As for the Kannauji, he mentioned that four times it is called \"Prastha\" and that a quarter of it is called \"Kudava\". As for the Somnathi, he mentioned in its multiples that sixteen of it is \"Patha\" and twelve Pathas is called \"Mura\" [?]. In the multiples of Sibi also from another aspect, that twelve «2» of it is called \"Kalsa\" and its quarter is \"Mana\". He indicated in its weight of wheat to be close to five \"Manas\". So Sibi is twenty Manas. That is similar to the \"Sukh\" in Khwarazm according to their old custom, and Kalsa is similar to the \"Ghur\" for it is twelve times the Sukh. As for the Cubit (Dhra'), it is for distances by straight lines and for areas in planes. The requirement of analogy in planes is that they be measured by a part of them, a plane like them, except that the measuring of the lines which are their limits substitutes for them. We were, upon narrating from \"Varahamihira\", when we reached the size of the barleycorn, deviated from it to the weights and used it in heaviness. We returned now to use it in distances. We say: Eight joined barleycorns are \"Angula\", which is a finger/digit. Four digits are called \"Rama\" [?], which is the fist. Twenty-four digits are \"Hasta\", which is a cubit, and it is also called \"Dasta\". Four cubits are \"Dhanu\", meaning a bow of their bows, and the fathom (Ba') equals it. Forty bows are \"Nala\". Twenty-five Nalas are \"Krosa\". The result of this is that the cubits of \"Kroh\" are four thousand, and the cubits of the mile with us are likewise. So the mile then is equal to Kroh. Likewise, \"Paulus\" the Greek mentioned in his \"Siddhanta\" that Kroh is four thousand cubits. The cubit is two measures (Miqyas), meaning twenty-four digits.

    "text": "...that they «1» name half of a sixth of the gnomon absolutely a finger (digit) as we do. But their gnomon is always a span. The span is what is between the tips of the thumb and the little finger after stretching the palm and fingers to the utmost possible. It is called \"Vitasti\" and also \"Kishku\" [?]. If the tip of the ring finger is measured to the tip of the thumb, the distance between them after stretching is called \"Gokarna\". If the tip of the index finger is measured to it, it is \"al-Fitr\" (span between thumb and index) and is called \"Karabha\" «2», and is estimated at two-thirds of the span. As for measuring the tip of the middle finger with the tip of the thumb, the distance between them is called \"Tala\". By it, they claimed, its owner is eight times [its length], whether the stature is short or extended, as was said in ancient times that it is seven statures (feet?). In the making of idols from the book \"Samhita\", he made the width of the palm six in a length of seven. The length of the middle finger is five, the ring finger like it, the index finger less by a sixth, the little finger by a third, and the thumb like two-thirds of the middle finger, of two equal divisions. These estimations and numbers are by the fingers of the idol. Since the magnitude of \"Krosa\" which we said is equal to the mile is verified, let it be known that they have in distances a magnitude called \"Yojana\". It contains eight miles. So it is then thirty-two thousand cubits. Some people might think that \"Kroh\" is a quarter of a Parsang (Farsakh), so they claim that the Parsangs of India are estimated at sixteen thousand cubits. It is not so; those are half Yojanas. This magnitude is the one mentioned in the Zij of Al-Fazari as \"Ajwan\" «4» for the circumference of the earth. All their ancients held regarding the circumference of the circle that it is three times the diameter. In \"Matsya Purana\", when he mentioned the Yojanas of the diameters of the Sun and Moon, he said: And the circumference is three times the diameter. In \"Aditya Purana\" also, when he mentioned the Yojanas of the width of \"Dvipas\", which are the islands, and the seas surrounding them, he said: And the circumference is three times the diameter. Likewise in \"Vayu Purana\". But their later ones realized the fraction following the integers. \"Brahmagupta\" goes in it to the seventh (1/7?), but he takes another approach, which is that the root...",

    "text": "...of ten, since it was three and a seventh by approximation, the ratio of every diameter to its circumference became the ratio of one to the root of ten. Therefore, he multiplies the diameter by itself, and the product by ten, and takes the root of the sum. So the circumference is irrational like the irrationality of the root of ten. But in any case, it comes out weightier than what is necessary. \"Archimedes\" restricted it between ten parts of seventy and eleven of seventy (i.e., between 3 10/70 and 3 11/70). Brahmagupta narrated from \"Aryabhata\" criticizing him: That he assumed the circumference 3393, then claimed in a place: that its diameter would be 1080, and in another 1050. As for the first saying, it necessitates the ratio as one to three and seventeen parts of a hundred and twenty of one (3.1416), and that is less than the seventh by a part of seventeen parts of a seventh. As for the second saying, there is no doubt in its corruption by the copy, not its author. It implies in the ratio as one to three and more than a quarter of one. As for \"Paulus\", he uses this ratio as one to three and [root?] of 1250 of one (Probably 3.1416, based on sqrt(10)? or ratio 177/1250 error in text). That is also less than the seventh by what is less than the opinion of \"Aryabhata\". That is borrowed from the ancient opinion which Ya'qub bin Tariq narrated in \"Composition of the Spheres\" from the Indian regarding the Yojanas of the circumference of the zodiacal sphere: That it is 1256640000, and regarding the Yojanas of its diameter: That it is 400000000. That is because the ratio is as one to three and 56640000 to 400000000. They fold by the agreement of 360000, so the fraction becomes 177 and the denominator 1250. That is what Paulisa held fast to.",

Therefore, it was restricted to the current time resembling the Now. How would the transfer of news from the past time to its future be possible on tongues, especially with the prolongation of times, were it not for what the power of speech in the human produced of the innovation of writing which flows in places like the flow of winds and from times to times like the flow of spirits? So glory be to the Perfecter of creation and the Rectifier of the affairs of creation. The Indians do not have the custom of writing on skins like the Greeks in ancient times. Socrates said when asked about his abandoning the authoring of books: \"I am not one to transfer knowledge from the living hearts of humans to the skins of dead sheep.\" Likewise, in the beginning of Islam, they used to write on leather, like the covenant of the Khaybaris among the Jews, and like the letter of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, to Chosroes, and as the copies of the Qur'an were written on gazelle skins, and the Torah is written on them also. So His saying, Exalted is He, \"They make it into Qaratises (papers/parchments)\" «1», means scrolls (Twamir). For the Qirtas (Papyrus) is made in Egypt from the pith of \"al-Bardi\" (Papyrus plant) cut «2» into its flesh. Upon it the letters of the Caliphs were issued until close to our time, as it does not submit to scraping anything from it and changing it; rather, it gets corrupted by it. Paper belongs to the people of China. Its manufacture was innovated in Samarkand by captives from them. Then it was made in various countries, so it was a filling of a need.

They call them \"Tari\" [Tala/Palm]. They write on them. A thread gathers their book from them, organizing them through a hole in their middles, passing through all of them. As for in the middle of the kingdom and its north, they take from the bark of the \"Tuz\" tree [Birch], a type of which is used in the coverings of bows. They call it \"Bhurja\" «2». In length of a cubit and width of extended fingers or less. They perform on it an operation like oiling and polishing by which it hardens and becomes smooth. Then they write on it. They are separate; their order is known by the numbers of the consecutive count. The whole book is wrapped «3» in a piece of cloth and fastened between two boards of their size. The name of these books is \"Pothi\". Their letters and all their causes are executed on the Tuz also. As for their script, it was said regarding it that it had been obliterated and forgotten, and no one cared for it until they became illiterate. That increased their ignorance and distance from knowledge until \"Vyasa the son of Parashara\" renewed their fifty letters by inspiration from Allah. The name of the letter is \"Akshara\". Some of them mentioned that their letters were fewer then increased. That is possible, indeed necessary. \"Asidhas\" [?] had pictured «4» for the immortalization of wisdom sixteen figures, and that was in the time of the dominion of the Children of Israel over Egypt. Then \"Cadmus\" and \"Agenor\" came with them to the Greeks, so they added four letters to them and used them as twenty. In the days in which Socrates was poisoned, \"Simonides\" added another four to them, so they were completed at the people of \"Athens\" then to twenty-four. That was in the time of \"Artaxerxes son of Darius son of Artaxerxes son of Cyrus\" according to the opinion of the historians of the people of the West. The letters of the Indians only multiplied because of isolating a form for the single letter when the diacritic alternates on it, and the hollowness (Anusvara?), and the Hamza (Visarga?), and the slight extension beyond the measure of the vowel.

Their writing is from left to right, like the custom of the Greeks, not on a baseline from which the heads rise and the tails descend as in our script. Instead, the line is above and straight for every single letter, and from it, the letter and its form descend downwards. If anything rises above the line, it is a grammatical sign establishing its inflection. As for the famous script among them, it is called \"Siddhamatrika\". It might be attributed to \"Kashmir\" [Kashmir], for the writing is among its people. It is used in \"Varanasi\" [Varanasi, India]; it and Kashmir are the two schools of their sciences. Then it is used in \"Madhyadesha\", I mean the middle of the kingdom, which is what surrounds \"Kannauj\" [Kannauj, India] in its directions; it is also called \"Aryavarta\". In the borders of \"Malwa\" [Malwa, India], there is also a script called \"Nagari\", which does not differ from that one except in forms only. It is followed by a script called \"Ardhanagari\", meaning half-Nagari, because it is mixed from both; it is written in \"Bhatia\" and some lands of \"Sindh\" [Sindh, Pakistan]. After that, among the scripts are \"Malwari\" in \"Malwashau\" in the south of Sindh towards the coast; \"Saindhava\" in \"Bahmanwa\", which is \"Al-Mansura\" [Brahmanabad, Pakistan]; \"Karnata\" in \"Karnatadesh\" [Karnataka, India], from which comes the group known in the armies as Kannara; \"Andhri\" in \"Andhradesh\" [Andhra Pradesh, India]; \"Dravidi\" in \"Dravidadesh\" [Dravida/Tamil Nadu, India]; \"Lari\" in \"Lardesh\" [Gujarat, India]; \"Gauri\" in \"Purvadesh\", meaning the eastern region; and \"Bhaikshuki\" in \"Udunpur\" [Odantapuri, India] there, which is the script of the \"Buddha\" (Buddhists).

They do not apply any calculation (numerology) to their letters as we do to ours in the arrangement of Abjad (Alphanumerical system).

The people of \"Kashmir\" mark the pages with figures that are like engravings or like the letters of the people of \"China\", which are not known except by habit and frequent practice, and they are not used in calculation on dust (sand tables). Among what all nations agree upon in calculation is the proportionality of its nodes (orders) by tens. There is no order in it except that its unit is one-tenth of the unit of the one after it, and ten times the unit of the one before it. I have tracked the matter of the names of the orders from whom I found among the nations specialized in languages, and I found them returning (repeating) in them from the thousands, like the Arabs, which is the most correct and most similar to the natural order; I have devoted a treatise to that. As for the Indians, they exceeded the order of thousands in naming with a variation where some improvise, some derive, and some mix one with the other. The names extended to the eighteenth order for religious reasons, in which the people of language assisted their owners by deriving names. The name of the eighteenth order is \"Parardha\", meaning half of the heaven, and in verification, half of what is above. That is because if the composition is of a \"Kalpa\", the unit of that order is a day for Allah the Almighty. Since there is nothing beyond the heaven, it is the greatest of bodies, and its half was likened to half of the greatest of days. By doubling it, a night is added to a day, and the Greatest Day is completed. Inevitably, the name Parardha rises from it and becomes \"Para\", which is the entire heaven. As for the names of the orders up to the eighteenth, they are what is in this table. I am describing their differences. One of them is that some of them claimed that beyond \"Parardha\" is a nineteenth called \"Bhuri\", then there is no calculation beyond it. Calculation is not finite except by convention, so that its orders also have an end. It is as if the expression of calculation is about the name. It has been known that the unit of...",

Nothing reporting (tradition-based) has been transmitted from them in this chapter; what remains in the reports is the composition of something from the Greatest Day as we will mention. This, then, is from the additions of the pretenders. Among them is that some of them claimed that the limit of calculation is to \"Koti\" (Crore), and from it, it returns to being attached to tens, hundreds, and thousands, because the number of the \"Devas\" (gods/angels) is in it. For they say they are thirty-three Koti, and for each of \"Brahma\", \"Narayana\", and \"Mahadeva\" there are eleven Koti. As for the names after the eighth, the grammarians only made them for what we mentioned. Among them is that the famous (term) among them for the fifth is \"Dasa-sahasra\" (Ten Thousand) and for the seventh \"Dasa-laksha\" (Ten Lakhs), because what we mentioned of their two names is rare in usage. In the book of \"Aryabhata of Kusumapura\" [Patna, India], the names of the orders from tens of thousands to tens of Koti are like this: \"Ayutam, Niyutam, Prayutam, Koti-padma, Parapadma\". Among them is that some of them pair many of them, so the sixth is called \"Niyutam\" following the pattern of the name of the fifth, and the eighth is named \"Arbudam\", so the ninth follows it in pattern, just as the twelfth follows the eleventh.

What is transmitted to us from \"Pulisa Siddhanta\" after \"Sahasram\" (Thousand), the fourth, is \"Ayutam\" the fifth, \"Niyutam\" the sixth, \"Prayutam\" the seventh, \"Koti\" the eighth, \"Arbudam\" the ninth, \"Kharva\" the tenth, and what is after it is according to what is in the previous table. As for the use of figures in calculation, it is according to the customs we have. I have composed a treatise on what increase they might have in it. We have previously reported about them that they compose books in \"Slokas\" (verse). If they need to express numbers in orders in their astronomical tables (Zijes), they express them with words designated for each number in one or two orders. However, they have designated several words for each number, so that if citing a word in a place is difficult, it is replaced by what is easy from its sisters. \"Brahmagupta\" said: If you want to write one, express it with everything that is one, like the earth and the moon. And for two, with everything that is two, like black and white (or eyes/hands). And for three, with everything containing three. And for zero, with the names of the heaven (sky/void). And for twelve, with the names of the sun. I have deposited in the table what I used to hear from them, for it is a great principle in solving their astronomical tables.

They braid beards into plaits to preserve them. They argue for leaving the pubic hair that shaving it is a stimulant for desire and increases the affliction, yet the one fond of sexual intercourse and eager for coitus among them does not shave it. They grow their nails long, boasting of idleness, for manual labor cannot be done with them, and for relief in scratching the head and picking lice from the hair. They eat singly, one by one, on a tablecloth of dung, and they do not return to the leftover food. They throw away the eating vessels if they are earthen. They redden their teeth by chewing \"Fufal\" (Areca nut) after consuming betel leaf and lime. They drink wine on an empty stomach then eat. They sip cow urine but do not eat its meat.

This is erroneous by collusion, not calculation. If they claim the difference is against us as we claimed it against them, we make the test in their children a judge. I have not found an Indian boy, new to falling into the lands of Islam and untrained in the customs of its people, but that he places the sandals before his master opposite to their true placement, I mean the right for the left foot, folds clothes inside out, spreads mats reversed, and the like, due to what is in the instinct of reflected nature. I do not single out the Indians for blame regarding ignorance (Jahiliyya); the Arabs used to commit enormities and scandals in the like of it, such as marrying menstruating and pregnant women, a group gathering to cohabit with one woman in a single period of purity, adopting adopted sons and children of guests, and burying daughters alive. Leave aside what was in their worship of whistling and clapping and in their food of filth and carrion. Islam has abolished it, just as it abolished most of what was in the land of India whose people accepted Islam. And praise be to Allah.",

    "text": "Chapter 17: On Sciences of Theirs That Skirt the Horizon of Ignorance. Magic (Sihr) is showing something to the senses contrary to its reality by a mode of deception. If looked at from this perspective, it is found common among people. If it is believed, as the commoners believe, that it is the bringing into existence of impossibilities, its matter has departed from verification. For if a thing is impossible, it does not exist either; so falsehood is apparent in its definition. Therefore, magic does not enter into science at all. Among its types is \"Alchemy\" (Kimiya), even if it is not named so. Do you not see that if someone took a piece of cotton and showed it to another as a piece of silver, it would only be attributed to magic? There is no difference between that and taking silver and showing it as gold, except from the side of custom. The Indians are not unique in delving into the matter of Alchemy; no nation is free from it, but some exceed others in fondness for it. That is not attributed in them to intellect or ignorance, for we find many intelligent people infatuated with it and many ignorant people mocking it and them. As for those intelligent ones, they are not blameworthy for undertaking it even if they were excessive in it, because what drives them to it is excessive eagerness to attract good and avoid harm. A wise man was asked about the reason for scholars frequenting the doors of the wealthy and the wealthy turning away from seeking the doors of scholars. He answered that it is due to the knowledge of the former of the benefits of wealth and the ignorance of the latter of the honor of knowledge. As for those ignorant ones, they are not praised for fleeing from it even if they abstain, because their motives for it are causes that are materials of evil...",

Therefore, it did not happen for me from the side of the Indians to know their methods in it, and to which origin they refer in it—mineral, animal, or plant—except that I used to hear from them sublimation, calcination, analysis, and waxing of talc, which is in their language \"Talaka\". So I guess from it that they incline towards the mineral path. They have an art similar to this chapter which the Indians are specialized in, and they call it \"Rasayana\". It is a name derived from gold, for it is \"Rasa\". It is for a craft restricted to managements, pastes, and compound medicines, most of which are from plants and their roots. They restore health to the sick who were despaired of, and youth to decreasing old men until they become in the state of adolescents regarding blackness of gray hair, sharpness of senses, and strength for action and sexual intercourse, indeed their attaining longevity in the world for long times. And why not? We have narrated previously from \"Patanjali\" that one of the ways of salvation is Rasayana. Who hears this and listens to its truth, then does not soil his trousers in joy and rapture and does not feed his teacher mouthfuls of his fresh (wealth/food)? Among those mentioned in this chapter is \"Nagarjuna\" from a fortress called \"Daihak\" near the place of \"Somnath\" [Somnath, India]. He was excelled in it and produced a book fulfilling (the subject) over others, rare. His time does not precede our time except by close to a hundred years. In the days of King \"Vikramaditya\"—and mention of his era will come—in the city of \"Ujjain\" [Ujjain, India], there was a man named \"Vyadi\" who devoted his ambition to this art and exhausted his life and wealth in it. His effort did not find for him what would ease his goal. When he was forced regarding expenses, he became weary of the diligence he had put forth in it. He sat on the bank of a river, regretful, distressed, and bored, holding his pharmacopoeia from which he used to take the recipes of medicines. He began throwing...",

The passage of the pages was by her, so she was gathering them and looking at \"Rasayana\" from them while he did not see her, until the pages were finished. She came to him asking the reason for what he did with his book. He answered her: 'Because I did not benefit from it, nor did I reach any of my desire, and I went bankrupt because of it after abundant treasures, and I suffered after long hope in attaining happiness.' The harlot said: 'Do not turn away from what you spent your life on, and do not despair of the existence of something the sages before you have established. Perhaps the barrier between you and reaching its reality is an accidental matter whose removal is also possible. I have much accumulated wealth, and all of it is offered to you to spend on seeking your objective.' So the man returned to his work. Books of such arts are written in code. An error used to occur to him in the recipe of the medicine from the linguistic side regarding the oil and human blood needed in it, for what was written was \"Raktamala\", and he thought they were red Myrobalan (Amalaka) and used it, so the medicine failed and did not succeed. When he started cooking the medicines, the fire hit his head and dried his brain, so he anointed himself with oil, pouring much of it on the crown of his head. He stood up from the fireplace for some business. The direction of his head coincided with a protruding peg from the roof beams, so it cracked his head with the impact and made him bleed. He returned looking down due to the pain that afflicted him. Drops of blood mixed with oil dripped from his fontanelle into the cauldron while he was unaware of that. Until the cooking was done, and he anointed himself with it for testing, he and the woman, and they flew in the air. \"Vikramaditya\" was informed of that, so he went out from his palace to the hippodrome to see them. The man called out to him: 'Open your mouth for my spit.' The King did not do that out of pride. The spit fell at the door, and the threshold was filled with gold. He went with the woman to where he wanted, flying. He produced famous books in this art, and he is with her until now, not having died, they claimed. Similar to this story is that in the city of \"Dhar\" [Dhar, India], the capital of \"Malwa\", which \"Bhojadeva\" owns in our time, on the governor's door in the house of the emirate is a piece of pure silver, square and rectangular, containing the likenesses of human limbs.

He said to the King: 'Throw yourself into it so I may complete the matter for you.' What he saw terrified the King, and he shrank from risking himself. When the man sensed his failure, he said to him: 'If you do not dare to do it and do not want it for yourself, would you approve it for me so that I do it myself?' The King said: 'That is up to you.' The man brought out packets of medicines and informed him of signs that would appear from him, to throw a specific packet upon him at the appearance of each one. The man stood to the oil and threw himself into it; he dissolved and disintegrated. The King began doing what he described to him until completion neared and one packet remained unthrown. The King feared him for his kingdom if he resurrected as mentioned, so he stopped throwing the packet. The pot cooled, and the man was gathered in it, and he is that ingot. They talk regarding \"Vallabha\", the King of the city of \"Vallabhi\" [Vala, India]—and we have mentioned his history in its chapter—that a man among those who attained the rank of \"Siddha\" asked some herdsmen about a plant called \"Thuhar\" (Euphorbia?), which is among the spurges that exude milk when plucked: Did he see any of it exuding blood instead of milk? He said: Yes. The man bribed him with something to show it to him. He did so. When he saw it, he lit a fire under it and threw the herdsman's dog into it. The herdsman became angry and took the man and did to him what he did to his dog. He waited until the fire died down and found both of them golden. He took his dog and left the man. Some villager stumbled upon him, cut off his finger, and brought it to a greengrocer who was nicknamed \"Rank\", meaning the Poor, for he was the most stingy of the poor and the most apparently destitute. He bought from him what he needed. He returned to the golden man and found his finger had grown and returned to its state. He began cutting it off and buying with it from that greengrocer what he wanted, until the greengrocer asked him about it. He guided him to it out of his stupidity. \"Rank\" went to the body of the \"Siddha\", carried it on a cart to his house, and became rich by its place. He (became so rich that he) took over the properties of the town. King \"Vallabha\" coveted him and demanded money from him. He refused him, then feared his malice, so he took refuge with the Lord of \"Al-Mansura\" [Brahmanabad, Pakistan], offered him monies, and asked for his help with a water army in ships. He answered him to that and aided him. He attacked King Vallabha at night, killed him, destroyed his people, and ruined his town. It is said...",

The greed of their ignorant kings for this chapter reaches such an extent that one of them might desire a matter, and the killing of a number of young, handsome boys is presented to him (as a requirement), so he does not care about the atrocity regarding them and devotes himself to throwing them into the fire. Such a precious quest, if referred from places to what cannot be reached, would be more correct. Among the speech of \"Isfandiyar\" at his death was: 'Kay Ka'us' was given the ability and the wondrous matters mentioned in the book of religion when he went to Mount Qaf as an old man bent by age, and returned from it a young man, joyous, of moderate stature, filled with strength, having taken the clouds as a vehicle by the permission of Allah. As for incantations and charms, their faith in them is sincere, and the majority of them are inclined towards them. The book for them is attributed to \"Garuda\", which is among the birds the vehicle of \"Narayana\". Some of them describe it with attributes indicating the stork/bustard and infer (its power) by its action, which is that it is the enemy of fish in hunting. In the nature of animals is aversion to the opposite and guarding against the enemy. Furthermore, if it flutters over the water and cries, the fish emerge from the depth of the water to its face, and hunting them becomes easy for it, as if it bound them with its magic. Some of them describe it with attributes not exceeding anxiety. It was described in \"Vayu Purana\" with yellowness, and it is closer to the stork than the bustard due to what it is naturally disposed to of destroying snakes. Most charms are directed towards the bitten person. Their excess in this chapter reaches such that I heard some of them claiming to have seen a bitten person who died, then was charmed after his death until he lived and remained in the world alive moving about like others. I heard another claiming to have seen a bitten person dead who rose by the charm, spoke, made a will, pointed out deposits, and defined things, and when he inhaled the smell of food, he fell down dead and lifeless. It is their custom that if the bite injures its victim and a charmer is not found, they tie the bitten person on a bundle of reeds and place on him a paper on which is written 'A prayer for whoever finds him and saves him by the charm from the predicament'.

I found nothing with them regarding it other than habituation, graduation, and steadiness on a single tune. We find our people likewise in hunting deer, which are wilder than gazelles. If they see them crouching, they start circling them chanting with a single voice that does not change until they get used to it. Then they start narrowing the circle until it reaches the extent of being able to strike while they are still. Indeed, hunters of sandgrouse at night beat copper vessels with a rhythm that does not change, so they hunt them by hand. If the rhythm changes, they fly away completely.

Imagine regarding the Inhabited World (Oikoumene) that it is in the northern half of the earth, and from this half in a half; so the Inhabited World is then in a quarter of the four quarters of the earth. A sea surrounds it called in the directions of the West and East \"Muhit\" (Surrounding Ocean). The Greeks call what is adjacent to the West of it, which is their region, \"Oceanus\". It is a separator between this Inhabited World and what might be behind this sea in the two directions of land or habitation on an island, as it is not traversed due to the darkness of the air, the thickness of the water, the disturbance of the routes, and the greatness of the risk with lack of benefit. Therefore, the ancients made signs in it and on its coasts preventing traversing it. As for the direction of the North, habitation is cut off by the cold before it, except in places where tongues and gulfs enter from it. As for the direction of the South, habitation ends at the coast of the sea connected to the Ocean on both sides. It is traversed, and habitation is not cut off at it; rather, it is filled with large and small islands. This sea and the land dispute the position so that one of them enters the other. As for the land, it enters the sea in the western half, and its coast becomes distant in the south. So in those deserts are the \"Sudan\" (Blacks) of the West from whom servants are brought, and the \"Mountains of the Moon\" from which are the sources of the Nile River. On the coast and islands are the races of the Zanj. Gulfs enter the land in this western half of the sea, such as the Gulf of \"Berbera\", the Gulf of \"Qulzum\" [Red Sea], and the Gulf of \"Fars\" [Persian Gulf]. The land of the West enters into it between these gulfs to some extent. As for in the half...",

This sea is called in most cases by the name of what is in it or what is adjacent to it. We need from it what is adjacent to the land of India, so it is named after them. After that, imagine in the Inhabited World towering connected mountains, as if they are vertebrae of a spine in it, extending in the middle of its latitudes lengthwise from East to West. They pass through \"China\" [China], \"Tibet\" [Tibet], the \"Turks\", then \"Kabul\" [Kabul, Afghanistan], \"Badakhshan\" [Badakhshan, Afghanistan/Tajikistan], \"Tokharistan\", \"Bamiyan\" [Bamiyan, Afghanistan], \"Ghor\" [Ghor, Afghanistan], \"Khurasan\" [Khorasan], \"Al-Jibal\" (Media), \"Azerbaijan\" [Azerbaijan], \"Armenia\" [Armenia], \"Rum\" (Byzantium/Anatolia), \"Franks\" (France/Western Europe), and the \"Jalaliqa\" (Galicians in Spain). In its extension, it has width with distance and bends surrounding deserts and inhabitants within, and rivers exit from it to both directions. The land of India is from those deserts; their mentioned sea surrounds it from its south, and from the rest of the directions those lofty mountains, and to them (the seas/lands?) is the pouring of its waters. Indeed, if you thought while observing it and its rounded stones found wherever digging reaches—large near the mountains and the intensity of the flow of river waters, and smaller at a distance and the slackening of the flow, and sands upon stagnation and nearing the sinks and the sea—you would hardly imagine their land to be anything but a sea in ancient times that was filled by the loads of the floods. Its middle is what is around the country of \"Kannauj\" [Kannauj, India], and they call it \"Madhyadesha\", meaning the Middle of the Kingdoms. That is from the perspective of location because it is between the sea and the mountain, and between the hot lands and the cold lands, and between its eastern and western borders. From the perspective of kingship, Kannauj was the dwelling of their great ones, the tyrant Pharaohs. The land of \"Sindh\" [Sindh, Pakistan] is to its west. Reaching Sindh from us is from the land of \"Nimruz\", I mean the land of \"Sijistan\" [Sistan, Iran/Afghanistan], and to India from the side of \"Kabul\". However, that is not obligatory, for reaching it is possible from every side when obstacles are removed. In the mountains surrounding their land, there are people of them or resembling them, rebellious, up to the borders where their race cuts off. The city of Kannauj is situated on the west of the river \"Ganges\" [Ganges River]. It is very large, and most of it now is a deserted ruin due to the removal of the seat of the Kingdom from it to the city of \"Bari\", which is east of the Ganges; between them is a journey of three or four days.

The river Ganges comes out from those mentioned mountains, and its source is called \"Gangadvara\" [Haridwar, India], and likewise the sources of most of their rivers are from them, as we mentioned in its place. As for their countries and the distances between them, the reliance for one who has not witnessed them is on reports. Ptolemy continues to complain about their carriers and their eagerness for guessing in them. I have found another rule for their lying, which is that the Indians might assume for the load of an ox two thousand Mana or three thousand, so they are compelled by that to move the caravan back and forth between the two ends of every stage for many days until the ox transports all its load from one side to the other. Then they calculate the distance between the two countries as a journey of days summed from the repetitions. We have no way to correct the reports except by the utmost diligence and caution, and leaving what we know for what we do not know is ugly.

Also, from Dhar in the South to the valley of \"Namiyah\" [Narmada?] is seven, and to \"Mahrat Desh\" [Maharashtra] eighteen, and to the province of \"Konkan\" and its capital \"Thana\" [Thane, India] on the coast twenty-five. They mention that in the wilds of Konkan called \"Dang\" is an animal called \"Shara\" [Sharabha] with four legs, and on its back like the legs are four others towards the top, with a small trunk and two great horns. It strikes «3» the elephant with them and cuts it in two halves. It is in the form of a buffalo, greater than the \"Ganda\" (Rhinoceros). They claim that it might butt a beast and lift it or part of it towards its back, so it falls between its upper legs and rots and becomes wormy, so it takes hold in its back, and it does not cease rubbing against trees until it perishes. They say that it might hear the sound of thunder and think it is an animal, so it intends it and climbs the peak of the mountain passes towards it and jumps from it to it, so it falls and is crushed. As for the Ganda, it is plentiful in the land of India and especially around \"Ganges\". It is in the form of a buffalo, black-skinned, scaly, with dewlaps, and with three hooves on each leg, yellow, one large to the front and two on the sides. Its tail is not long, and its eyes are lowered from the usual place to the cheek. On the tip of its nose is a single horn having a curve upwards. The \"Brahmins\" specialize in eating its meat. I witnessed a young one of it strike an elephant that obstructed it, so it wounded «4» its arm with the horn and butted it. I used to think it was the Karkadann (Rhinoceros) until some who arrived from \"Sofala of the Zanj\" [Sofala, Mozambique] informed me that the \"Kark\" whose horn is used in the handles of knives there is close to this description. It is called in Zanj \"Impila\". It has various colors. On its crown is a conical horn, wide at the bottom, of little height; its arrow in the inside is black and the rest is white.

It has hooves and a tail like the tail of a donkey, hairy. Crocodiles are found in the rivers of India as they are in the Nile, such that Al-Jahiz thought, due to the soundness of his heart and his distance from knowing the courses of rivers and the forms of seas, that the river \"Mehran\" [Indus] is a branch of the \"Nile\". Indeed, there are found «1» in it also wondrous animals of crocodiles and \"Makar\" (Makara) and strange types of fish, and an animal like a wineskin that appears to ships and swims and plays, which they call \"Barlu\". I think it is the Dolphin or a type of it, for it has been said that on its head is a slit for breathing as the Dolphin has. In their southern rivers is an animal called \"Krah\" [Graha?] and perhaps called \"Jalatanta\" «2», and also \"Tandua\". It is thin, very long. They claimed that it lies in wait for whoever enters the water and stands in it, whether human or beast. It intends him and begins circling him at a distance from him until its length is exhausted, then it contracts and knots on his legs and fells him and destroys him. I heard some of them narrate from witnessing that it has a head like the head of a dog and a tail with many long branches which it wraps on the animal when unawares, then it drags him by it to the tail until it twists it on him and the matter is tightened so he does not escape from it.

Its south and east belong to the Indians, and its west to kings, the nearest of whom is \"Bolor Shah\", then \"Shughnan Shah\" and \"Wakhan Shah\" to the borders of \"Badakhshan\". Its north and some of the east belong to the Turks of \"Khotan\" and \"Tibet\". From the pass of \"Bhoteshar\" to Kashmir on the land of Tibet is close to three hundred Farsakhs. The people of Kashmir are pedestrians; they have no riding animals or elephants. Their nobles ride \"Katuts\" [?], which are litters carried on the necks of men. They maintain the fortification of the place, so they are always cautious in securing its entrances and paths. Therefore, mixing with them has become difficult. In the past, one or two strangers used to enter it, especially Jews. Now they do not let an unknown Indian enter it, let alone others. Its most famous entrance is from the village of \"Babrahan\", which is on the middle of the road between the rivers \"Sindh\" and \"Jhelum\".

Then it exits to the plain and ends at \"Adhishtana\" [Srinagar], the capital of Kashmir, in two days, in which one descends to the town of \"Ushkara\" [Ushkura], and it and the town of \"Baramula\" [Baramulla] are on both sides of the valley. The city of \"Kashmir\" is four Farsakhs built lengthwise on the two banks of the water of Jhelum, and between them are bridges and boats. Its source is from the mountains of \"Harmakut\" [Harmukh], from which is also the source of \"Ganges\". They are cold highlands not trodden; their snows do not melt nor perish. Behind them is \"Mahachin\", meaning Great China. When the water of Jhelum exits from the mountains and extends a journey of two days, it penetrates Adhishtana, then enters at four Farsakhs from it a swamp (lake) [Wular Lake] whose size is a Farsakh by a Farsakh. Their farms are on its banks and what they reclaim from it. Then it exits from the swamp to the town of Ushkara and leads to the gorge. As for the water of \"Sindh\" [Indus], it exits from the mountains of \"Unang\" in the borders of the \"Turks\". That is because if you emerge from the gorge of the entrance, the mountains of \"Bolor\" and \"Shamilan\" are on your left. At a journey of two days are Turks called \"Bhattavaryan\", and their king is \"Bhatta Shah\". Their lands are \"Gilgit\", \"Asura\" [Astore?], and \"Shaltas\" [Chilas?]. Their language is Turkish. Kashmir is in affliction from their raids. The traveler on the left extends in the built areas to the Capital, and on the right to connected villages on the south of the Capital, and leads to Mount \"Kalarjak\" [Pir Panjal?], which is like a dome resembling Mount \"Damavand\". Snow never recedes from it, and it is always seen from the borders of \"Takishar\" [Taxila?] and \"Lohawar\" [Lahore]. Between it and the plain of \"Kashmir\" is two Farsakhs. The fort of \"Rajagiri\" is to its south and the fort of \"Lahur\" [Lohara] to its west. I have not seen stronger than them. At three Farsakhs from it is the town of \"Rajauri\" [Rajouri], and to it our merchants trade and do not go beyond it. This is the border of the land of India from the direction of the North. In the western mountains of it are varieties of Afghan tribes until they end near the land of Sindh. As for the Southern direction of it, it is the sea. Its coast takes from \"Tiz\" [Tiz, Iran], the capital of \"Makran\", traveling towards between the South and the East towards the region of \"Daybul\" [Debal/Banbhore, Pakistan] forty Farsakhs.

After the mentioned Gulf is \"Manhah\" the Small, then the Great, then the Bawarij [Pirates], thieves, and their places are \"Kutch\" «1» and \"Somnath\". They were named this because they commit piracy in boats named \"Bira\".

From Rameshar «5» to \"Setubandha\", meaning the Bridge of the Sea, is two Farsakhs. It is the dam of \"Rama bin Dasharatha\" to the fort of \"Lanka\". It is now mountains cut off, between which is the sea. At sixteen Farsakhs from it towards the East is \"Kihkand\" [Kishkindha?], which are the mountains of monkeys.

Whoever falls to them and recites the poetry of Rama to them and incites his incantations upon them, they listen to them and calm down to listen to them, guide the lost, and give food and drink. If there is anything of this, it is from the side of the melody as preceded in the chapter on gazelles. As for the Eastern Islands in this sea, which are closer to the border of China, they are the islands of \"Zabaj\" [Srivijaya/Malay Archipelago], and the Indians call them \"Suvarna Dvipa\", meaning the Islands of Gold. The Western ones are the islands of \"Zanj\" [East Africa]. The middle ones are the islands of \"Ramm\" and \"Dibajat\" (Maldives/Laccadives), and among their whole are the islands of \"Qumayr\" [Khmer/Madagascar?]. The islands of \"Diva\" [Maldives] have a property, which is that they arise, so a piece of sand appears from the sea, continuing to rise, spread, and grow until it solidifies; and another of them over days weakens, withers, and melts until it sinks and perishes. When its people sense that, they seek a new one increasing in freshness, so they transfer the coconut, palm, crops, and furniture to it and move to it. These islands are divided into two parts by what rises from them. They are called \"Diva Kudha\", meaning the Islands of Cowrie Shells (Wada'), which they gather from coconut branches they plant in the sea; and \"Diva Kanbar\", the yarn spun from coconut fiber (Coir) for stitching ships. The island of \"Waqwaq\" is from the whole of Qumayr. It is a name not as the common people think from a tree whose fruit is like the heads of people crying out. Rather, Qumayr are a people whose colors tend towards whiteness, short in stature, on the forms of the Turks and the religion of the Hindus, with pierced ears. The people of the island of \"Waqwaq\" among them are black in color. People are more desirous of them. Black Ebony is imported from them, which is the heart of a tree that sheds its bark. As for \"Mulamma'\" (Spotted/Variegated wood?), \"Shawhat\" (Yew/Boxwood?), and Yellow Sandalwood, they are from Zanj. There was in the gulf of \"Sarandib\" a pearl fishery which became void in our time, then appeared in Sofala of the Zanj after it had not been, so they say that it has moved to it.

I have heard them claiming that the number of the names of the Sun with them is a thousand. Inevitably, every planet has the like or close to that of multitude, for it is necessary. The names of the days of the week with them are the names of the seven planets by their most famous names. They call the position in the week \"Vara\". So the name of the planet follows, on the form of following \"Shanbeh\" in Persian, the number of the day of the week. So Sunday is \"Aditya Vara\", meaning for the Sun. Monday is \"Soma Vara\", meaning for the Moon. Tuesday is \"Mangala Vara\", meaning for Mars. Wednesday is \"Budha Vara\", meaning for Mercury. Thursday is \"Brihaspati «1» Vara\", meaning for Jupiter. Friday is \"Shukra Vara\", meaning for Venus. Saturday is \"Shanaishchara «2» Vara\", meaning for Saturn. And the matter returns to the Sun. The astrologers among us call them the Lords of the Days. The approach of the matter in it is by counting the hours from the Lord of the Day according to the order of the spheres of the planets descending towards the bottom. For example: The Sun is the Lord of Sunday, and it is also the Lord of the first hour. Then the second is for the planet whose sphere is below the sphere of the Sun, which is Venus.

Based on this, the twenty-fifth «2» is for the Moon, and that is the first of Monday, so the Moon is its Lord and the Lord of the Day. There is no difference between these and those except in one thing, which is that our astrologers «3» use in that the uneven (temporal) hours, so the thirteenth from the Lord of the Day is the Lord of the Night following the Day, and it is the third from the Lord of the Day, contrary to that counting, meaning by ascent towards the height. As for the Indians, they make the Lord of the Day the Lord of the whole Day (24 hours), so the night follows the day, not specified with a Lord separately. This is the path of their majority. Perhaps the matter of the uneven hours is imagined from their conventions, for they call the hour \"Hora\". By this name, they also call half of the Zodiac Sign in the work of \"Nimbaharat\" (half-divisions?). I saw in some of their Zijes (astronomical tables) in extracting the Lord of the Hour that what is between the Sun and the degree of the Ascendant in equal degrees is divided by fifteen, and one is added to what comes out of whole numbers, and the fraction is discarded if there is any. Then that amount is counted from the Lord of the Day in the sequence of the spheres towards the bottom. This is closer to working with uneven hours than with even ones. The Indians have acquired a habit in arranging the planets by days to which they hasten in their Zijes and books and turn away from other arrangements, even if they are closer to the truth. For the planets, according to the Greeks, there are symbols by which the terms (limits) are established in astrolabes for alleviation, and they are not from the figures of letters. Likewise, the Indians do in abbreviation, but the symbols are not original, but rather the first letter of the name of every planet, like the Alif from \"Aditya\" for the Sun, the Jim from \"Chandra\" «4» for the Moon, and the Ba from \"Budha\" for Mercury.

Among them is \"Savita\", which is a name applying to everyone to whom a child is born; since the births of the world are from it, it was named by it. Among them is \"Ravi\" because it dries up moistures; that is because the water in the plant is called \"Rasa\", and whoever takes it is called \"Ravi\". Then the Moon is its companion and follower. Its names are also many. Among them is \"Soma\" because it is a benefic (Sa'd), and benefics are called \"Soma Graha\" and malefics \"Papa Graha\". Among them is \"Nishisha\", meaning the Owner of the Night, and \"Nakshatranatha\", meaning the Owner of the Mansions, and \"Dvijeshvara\", meaning the Owner of the Brahmins, and \"Shitamshu\", meaning Cold-Rayed because its sphere is watery and in it is happiness. If the ray falls on it, it cools like its coldness and reflects, illuminating the darkness, cooling the night, and extinguishing what the Sun corrupted by burning. For this also it was named \"Chandra\". It is the left eye of \"Narayan\" just as the Sun is his right eye. I have deposited in this table the suns of the months. The affliction of difference in it is like what preceded in the enumeration of the earths:\n[Table Columns 1-5]",

His magnifiers open the months from \"Margashirsha\", and his name in it is \"Keshava\". If his names are counted, his name in the month of \"Chaitra\" agrees to be \"Bishn\" [Vishnu] as it is in Vishnu Dharma. He also said in \"Gita\": I am like \"Vasanta\", meaning the Equinox (Spring) in the sixths of the year. That testified to the correctness of what is in the beginning of the table. As for the names of the months, they share the names of the Mansions. Each month is specialized with a number of Mansions; its name is derived «1» from one of them. We have written that in the table in red so the sharing appears. Also, if Jupiter rises in one of the Mansions, the month which that Mansion is in its domain becomes the Owner of the Year, and the whole year is attributed to that month.

The name of the third Sign is \"Mithuna\", which is a name applying to a boy and a girl together; that is the meaning of the Twins which are the image of the Sign. \"Varahamihira\" mentioned in the Great Book of Nativities: That it is in the image of a man holding a lute and a club. It is as if he went to the image of Orion (al-Jabbar) as the majority of commoners went to it until the Sign became famous as Gemini (al-Jawza) which is not its image. He mentioned in the image of the sixth Sign that it is a ship and in its hand is a spike of grain (Spica). It is as if something fell from our copy, for a ship has no hand. The name of the Sign among them is \"Kanya\", which is the Virgin Girl. It is as if it was said a virgin in a ship with a spike in her hand. It is Spica (Al-Simak Al-A'zal). It is thought of the ship that it is the stars of Bootes (Al-Awwa) which is one of the Mansions of the Moon, for it is on a line whose end curves. He said in the image of the seventh Sign: That it is a fire, and its name is \"Tula\", which is the Balance (Libra). He said in the tenth Sign: That its face is the face of a goat and the rest is \"Makara\". If Makara is said, the face of the goat is dispensed with. The Greeks only need it because they composed the image from two animals; what is above the chest of it is a goat and what is below it is a fish. The sea animal named Makara is like that according to what they described, dispensed from composition. He said in the image of the eleventh Sign: That it is a jar, and its name \"Kumbha\" «2» agrees with what he said, except that their counting it or part of it in the images of humans is proof that they follow in it the doctrine of the Greeks of the Man Pouring Water (Aquarius). He mentioned in the last Sign that it is on the image of two fish, even if its name implies one fish in all languages. He mentioned for the Signs names in their language not familiar; we placed them in this table. It is of their custom, if they establish the Signs by numbers, they do not begin with zero for Aries and one for Taurus, but they begin with one for Aries and two for Taurus until twelve is for Pisces. «1» «2»",

When they count the heavens, they say: Indeed their totality is \"Brahmanda\". These are among those who lacked training in the science of astronomy (Hay'ah) and did not conceive it correctly, so they do not see for the heavens other than stillness, especially because they make them the settlement of the Sects. They think of them transfer and reliance towards the bottom when they describe the bliss of Paradise with the likeness of what is witnessed in the world on earth. In their informative symbols: Indeed water was before everything, and the place of the world was filled with it. Inevitably that was in the first day of the Soul and the beginning of formation and composition. They said: The water foamed by waving, so a white thing emerged from it. The Creator created from it the Egg of \"Brahm\". Some of them say: It split and Brahm came out of it. The heaven became from one of its halves and the earth from the other and the rains from the broken pieces between them. If they had said the mountains, it would have been more appropriate for it than rains and more similar. Some of them say indeed Allah the Exalted said to Brahm: I am creating an egg to make it for your dwelling in it. He created it from the foam of the mentioned water. When it dried and sank, He broke the egg then into two halves. The Greeks went to something close to it regarding \"Asclepius\" «1» the deviser of the art of medicine.

Asclepius is not of a lower rank than Brahma, for they mentioned regarding him that he is a divine power derived by this name from his action, which is the prevention of dryness, because death occurs when dryness and cold prevail. Although in natural lineage they say of him that he is the son of 'Apollo', and he is the son of 'Phlegyas', and he is the son of 'Coronis', which is the planet Saturn; all of that is due to the power of trigons. As for the precedence of water according to the Indians in creation, it is because by it is the cohesion of every mixture and the growth of every growing thing and the sustenance of life in every possessor of spirit. Thus, it is an instrument and tool for the Creator if He intends creation from matter. The Revelation (Quran) spoke likewise in the saying of Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He: 'And His Throne was upon the water', whether carried from the apparent wording upon a specific body named by this name commanded to be magnified, or carried upon interpretation as dominion and the like. The meaning is that at that time, after Allah, there was nothing but water and His Throne. Were it not that our book is restricted to the doctrines of a single sect, we would have cited from the doctrines of the sects that were in Babylon and around it in ancient times what resembles the story of this egg and exceeds it in absurdity. As for the Indians' reference to halving the egg, it is because the author of this speech was a commoner who did not know the encompassing of the heaven around the earth like the encompassing of the shell of 'Brahmanda' around its yolk. Rather, he conceived the earth as below and the heaven as above from one of its sides only. If he had verified the matter, he would not have needed to split the egg, but he aimed to spread half of it as earth and erect the other half over it as a dome. So he surpassed Ptolemy in flattening the sphere, but he did not excel him. Symbols have remained thus, interpreted by every taker according to what agrees with his belief.

Thus he referred to the two motions and to the spheres of the planets by way of symbolism as is his custom. And 'Brahmagupta' said in the first treatise of 'Brahmasiddhanta' when he enumerated the heavens and placed the moon in the first of them and ascended with the planets to the seventh, placing Saturn in it: That the fixed stars are in the eighth, and that it was made round to endure, so the doer of good is rewarded in it and the evildoer punished, as there is nothing beyond it. He indicated in this chapter that the heavens are the spheres, and in their arrangement contrary to what is in their religious traditional books as we will recount in its place, and in rounding (circularity) to the slowness of being affected, and to what 'Aristotle' holds regarding the round and circular motion, and to the fact that there is no existing body beyond the spheres. If it is so, it is not hidden that 'Brahmanda' is the collection of spheres, I mean the Ether, indeed the Whole, because recompense according to them occurs in its interior as well. 'Paulisa' said in his 'Siddhanta': The totality of the world is the sum of earth, water, fire, wind, and heaven created beyond the darkness. The heaven appeared azure in color due to the falling short of the sun's rays from it so that it would be illuminated by it like the illumination of the non-luminous watery spheres, I mean by them the bodies of the planets and the moon, which if the sun's ray falls upon them and the earth's shadow does not reach them, their blackness goes away and their figures appear at night. So the Luminous One is one, and the rest are illuminated by it. He indicated in this chapter the perceived limit and called it heaven and placed it in darkness by mentioning its being in the place which the ray does not reach. The investigation into the visible greyish color would be very long. Brahmagupta said in the mentioned treatise: Multiply the cycles of the moon, which are 57,753,300,000, by the 'Yojanas' of its sphere, which are 324,000, and the sum is 18,712,069,200,000,000, and those are the Yojanas of the sphere of the Zodiac.

As for 'Vasistha', he said: 'Brahmanda' encompasses the spheres, and these numbers are its measure because the sphere of the Zodiac is connected to it. As for 'Balabhadra' the commentator, he said: We do not make these numbers the measure of the heaven, for we cannot determine its greatness, but we make them for the limit of sight, for no perceptible object is higher than it, despite the disparity of other spheres in greatness and smallness. The followers of 'Aryabhata' said: Knowing the place reached by the ray suffices us, and we do not need what it does not reach even if it is great in itself, for what the ray does not reach, sensation does not perceive, and what is not sensed is not known. What results from the speech of these people: From the saying of Vasistha, it is that Brahmanda is a sphere encompassing the eighth sphere marked by the Zodiac signs containing the fixed stars, and they are touching. We were compelled to the eighth sphere. As for what is above it, there is nothing compelling the necessity of a ninth sphere. People differ regarding it; some necessitate it for the sake of the westward motion, moving by it, overpowering what it contains upon it; and some necessitate it for its sake while it is stationary. As for the first group, their purpose is known, but 'Aristotle' has shown that every mover is moved by a mover not within it. That ninth sphere must have an external mover, so what prevents it from moving the eight spheres without the mediation of the ninth? As for the second group, it is as if they heard what we recounted and that the First Mover is unmoving, so they made their ninth sphere stationary and the westward motion issuing from it. But Aristotle has also shown that He is not a body, so describing Him with sphericity, circularity, encompassing, and stillness necessitates His corporeality. Thus, the ninth sphere leads to the impossible. In this sense, 'Ptolemy' says in the preface of the book 'Almagest': The First Cause of the first motion of the whole, if we imagine motion singly, we see that it is a god, invisible and unmoving, and we named the class of inquiry about it divine. We conceive this action in the highest height of the world only, completely distinct from sensible substances. This is what Ptolemy says about the First Mover without pointing to the sphere narrated from him by John the Grammarian in his refutation of 'Proclus', and he mentioned that 'Plato' did not know the ninth sphere which has no stars, which is what Ptolemy understood, he claimed.

The people referred to in the chapter title have held regarding the earths that they are seven layers, one above the other, and regarding the division of the highest of them into a heptad (sevenfold division), not according to what astronomers among us hold regarding the Climes (regions), or the Persians regarding the 'Kishvars'. We want, after presenting the declaration of their sayings extracted from the side of the masters of their laws, to stand for fairness. If something appears to us in it or agreement with others, even if they are not correct in it together, we will establish it, not by way of defending them, but intending to sharpen the nature for those who study them. They did not differ in the number of earths nor in the number of divisions of the highest one, but they differed in their names and in the order of names. Perhaps I attribute that difference to the breadth of the language, for they name a single thing with very many names. An example is the sun; they named it with a thousand names as they mentioned, similar to the Arabs naming the lion with close to that. Some are improvised improvisation, and some are derived from the varying conditions in it or the issuing actions. They and those like them boast of that, while it is one of the greatest defects of language. For its subject is applying a name to each of the existents and their effects by agreement among a group, by which they know each other's purpose when expressing that name in speech. If the single name itself applies to several named things, it indicates the narrowness of the language and forces the listener to ask...",

John the Grammarian said in his refutation of 'Proclus': A group of theologians saw in the sphere called 'Galaxias', meaning milk, which is the Milky Way, that it is a dwelling and resting place for rational souls. The poet 'Homer' says: You made the pure heaven an eternal dwelling for the gods, not shaken by winds, nor wet by rains, nor damaged by snows, but in it is splendid clarity with no clouds covering it. 'Plato' said: God said to the seven wandering planets: You are gods of gods, and I am the father of works, making you with a making in which there is no undoing; for everything bound, even if dissolvable, corruption does not attach to what is well-ordered. 'Aristotle' said in a letter of his to Alexander: The world is the system of all creation. As for what is above it and surrounds it from its diameters, it is the place of the gods, and the heaven is full of their bodies which we call stars for expression. He says in another place in it: The earth is surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by Ether. For this reason, the upper region became the place of the gods and the lower was estimated as the place of aquatic animals. In 'Vayu Purana' there is something similar: That the earth is held by water, water is held by pure fire, fire is held by wind, wind is held by heaven, and heaven is held by its Lord. He did not differ except in the order. Disagreement did not occur in the names of the 'Lokas' like it occurred in the earths. We also place their names in a table like the first: All of these are agreed upon except what happened to the commentator of the book 'Patanjali'. He heard that the 'Pitris', who are the fathers (ancestors), their gathering is in the sphere of the moon, which is speech based on the sayings of astrologers.

It was obligatory for him to leave Brahma Loka aside and establish 'Pitri Loka' in place of the first and not drop 'Svarloka'. This is what is regarding the seven earths and seven heavens. Let us also mention the divisions of the face of the upper earth, then what must follow that. We say: 'Dvipa' in their language is the name for island.

What the Indians hold from the side of religious traditions is that the earth we are on is round, surrounded by a sea, and on the sea is land like a collar, and on that land is a sea also round like a collar. On this system until each of the number of dry collars called islands (Dvipas) is completed, and the number of seas is seven, on the condition that each one of a genus is double the one within it of its genus, I mean the one adjoining it so it surrounds it. Thus the magnitudes of each of them follow the progression of numbers of the power of two. If the middle earth is one, the total of the seven collar earths is 127. If the sea surrounding the middle earth is one, the total of the seven collar seas also is 127. The total of seas and earths together is 254. However, the commentator of the book 'Patanjali' assumed for the middle earth one hundred thousand 'Yojanas', so the total for the earths would be 12,700,000. He assumed for the sea surrounding the middle earth two hundred thousand, and for the one after it four hundred thousand, so the sum for the seas is 25,400,000. The total of that is 38,100,000. He did not mention the total so we could compare it with this, except that he mentioned in 'Vayu Purana': That the diameter of the total of Dvipas and islands is 37,900,000. This does not agree with the first; indeed, there is no way for it unless the seas are six and starting in doubling from four. As for the number of seas, it can be interpreted that he omitted mentioning the seventh because he intended dry land, and if he mentioned it, he would need to mention what surrounds it. As for starting with four in doubling, I do not see a way for it in the established law. Each of the Dvipas and seas has a name; we place what we have of it in a table so our excuse is accepted: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8",

Let us recount now what resembles that and matches it, even if it is connected to places more worthy of it. That is that the commentator of the book 'Patanjali', when he wanted to define the world, started from its bottom and said: The magnitude of the darkness is one 'Koti' and eighty-five 'Lakh Yojanas', that is 18,500,000. Above it is 'Naraka', which is hells, thirteen Koti and twelve 'Lakh', that is 131,200,000. Then darkness of one Lakh, that is 100,000. Above it is the earth of 'Vajra' due to its hardness, which is diamond or the molten thunderbolt, 34,000. Then 'Garbha', which is the middle, 60,000. Above it is the Golden Earth, 30,000. Above it are the seven earths, each one ten thousand, so that is 70,000. The highest of them possesses the Dvipas and seas. Beyond the sea of fresh water is 'Lokaloka', meaning no-gathering, i.e., in which there is no habitation or sociable person. After it is the Earth of Gold, one Koti, that is 10,000,000. Above it is 'Pitri Loka' 6,134,000. The total of the seven Lokas whose sum is called 'Brahmanda' is fifteen Koti, that is 150,000,000. Above that is the darkness of 'Tamas' like the lower one, 18,500,000. We used to find mentioning the seven seas with the earths heavy until this man lightened it for us by adding lands beneath them. As for in 'Vishnu Purana' regarding the like of this art, he claimed: That under the seventh lower earth is a snake called 'Shesha' venerated by the spiritual beings, and also called 'Ananta', with a thousand heads, carrying...",

That these earths, layered one upon another, possess bounties and grace, adorned with gems, shining with their own light without the two luminaries, for they do not rise in them. Therefore, their climates are moderate, and aromatic plants and the blossoms of trees and fruits are perpetual in them. Times are hidden from their inhabitants as they do not sense movements by counting them. Their magnitude is seventy thousand 'Yojanas', each one ten thousand. That 'Narada' the Rishi arrived at them for viewing and witnessing who inhabits them of the two genii 'Daityas' and 'Danavas', so he considered the bliss of Paradise meager beside their bliss and returned to the angels recounting that to them and making them marvel at their description. He said: And that beyond the Fresh Sea is the Earth of Gold, double all the Dvipas and seas, not inhabited by human or jinn. Beyond it is 'Lokaloka', a mountain whose height is ten thousand Yojanas and width the like of that. The total of that is 1,500,000,000 (?), meaning fifty 'Koti'. This whole aggregate is called in their language sometimes 'Dhatri', meaning holder of all things, and sometimes 'Vidhatri', meaning their releaser, and also called the resting place of every living thing. How similar is this to what those differing on the Void hold, the affirmers of it making it the cause of attracting bodies to it, and the deniers of it making it non-existence. Then he returned to the Lokas and said: Everything that a foot can tread or a ship can sail in is 'Bhu Loka', as if he referred by that to the face of the upper earth. He said: And what is between the earth and the sun of the air in which 'Siddhas', 'Munis', and 'Gandharvas', the companions of Paradise, frequent is 'Bhuvar Loka'. The sum of the three is called 'The Three Prithivis' (Earths), and what is above them is 'Vyasa Mandala', meaning the province of Vyasa. From the earth to the place of the sun is one hundred thousand 'Yojanas'. From the place of the sun to the place of the moon is the like of that. From the moon to Mercury is two Lakhs, meaning two hundred thousand. From it to Venus likewise. From it to Mars, then Jupiter, then Saturn are equal distances, each one two hundred thousand. From Saturn to the Seven Rishis (Ursa Major) is one hundred thousand. From the Seven Rishis to the Pole is one thousand Yojanas. Above that is 'Mahar Loka', twenty...",

In 'Vayu Purana': The heaven rotates on the Pole like the potter's wheel, and the Pole rotates on itself and does not move from its place, completing the rotation in thirty Muhurtas, i.e., in a day and night. I did not hear from them regarding the South Pole except that a king they had named 'Somadatta' deserved Paradise for his good deeds, but his heart was not pleased with removing his body from his soul upon his transfer. So he sought 'Vasistha' the Rishi and informed him that he loved his body and did not want to leave it. He made him despair of carrying the earthly body from the world to Paradise. He also presented his need to the sons of Vasistha, but they confronted him with their spit and mocked him, turning him into a Chandala with pierced ears in a new tunic. He came to 'Visvamitra' the Rishi in that state. He found it atrocious and asked him about it. He informed him and told him the whole story. He became angry out of indignation for him and summoned the Brahmins to make a great sacrifice, Vasistha's sons being among them. He said to them: I want to make another world and another Paradise for the sake of this righteous king where he attains his desire.

'Indra' the Chief and the spiritual beings feared him, so they came to him pleading, asking him to neglect what he had started on condition that they carry Somadatta with his body as it is to Paradise. They did that. So he left the making of the second world except what he had made of it up to that time. It is known that the North Pole is marked among us by the Great Bear (Banat Na'sh) and the South by Canopus (Suhail), except that some of those resembling the commoners among our companions claim that in the southern direction of the sky there is a Great Bear in the form of the northern one rotating around that pole. That is not impossible nor innovative if its report is obtained from someone deeply experienced in sea travels, trustworthy and reliable. Unknown stars may appear in the southern regions. 'Sripala' claimed that in summer in Multan a red star appears lower than the orbit of Canopus which they call 'Shula', which is the wood of crucifixion, and that the Indians take it as a bad omen. Therefore, if the Moon is in 'Purva Bhadrapada', they do not travel towards the south because it is in it. Al-Jayhani mentioned in the 'Book of Routes': That in the island of 'Langabalus' (Nicobar?) a huge star is seen known as 'Dhu al-Hamma' (The Venomous/Feverish?) in winter at the time of dawn from the direction of the sunrise at an altitude like the height of a mast. From the tail of the Little Bear and its rear and small stars there, an elongated shape is formed called 'Fas al-Raha' (The Mill Axle?). 'Brahmagupta' mentions it as the Fish. The Indians have haphazard reports regarding depicting it in the form of an aquatic animal with four legs called 'Sakvara' (?) and also called 'Sishumara'. I think this Sishumara is the large lizard (Dhab), for its name in Persian is 'Susmar' and there is a resemblance between them. There is an aquatic one like the crocodile and the skink. Among those myths is that 'Brahma', when he wanted to generate humans, divided himself into two halves. The name of the right is 'Viraj' and the name of the left is 'Manu', after whom the turn 'Manvantara' was named. Manu had two sons, one 'Priyavrata' and the other 'Uttanapada', the King with clubfeet (or lame).",

His appearance was in 'Svayambhuva Manvantara', which is the first of the turns, and he remained in his place forever. In 'Vayu Purana': The wind moves the stars around the Pole, and they are tied to it by ties that people do not see, so they move like the example of the wood that is turned in the oil presses, for its base is like fixed and its end is rotating. In the book 'Vishnu Dharma': 'Vajra', who is one of the children of 'Balabhadra' brother of 'Narayana', asked 'Markandeya' the Rishi about the Pole. He answered him that 'Brahma', when he made the world, it was dark and desolate, so he made then the sphere of the sun luminous and the spheres of the stars watery, accepting its light from the face with which it faces them. He placed fourteen of them around the Pole in the form of 'Sishumara' (Porpoise/Dolphin) turning the rest of the stars around the Pole. Of them towards the North from the Pole on the upper jaw is 'Uttanapada', on the lower is 'Yajna', on the head is 'Dharma', on the chest is 'Narayana', on the hands towards the East the two stars 'Asvins' the physicians, on the feet 'Varuna' and 'Aryaman' towards the West, on the penis 'Samvatsara', on the anus 'Mitra', and on the tail 'Agni', 'Mahendra', 'Marichi', and 'Kasyapa'. He said: The Pole is 'Vishnu' the obeyed among the people of Paradise, and he is also Time which creates, grows, wears out, and destroys. Then he said: Whoever reads this and knows it with verification, Allah forgives him the sins of his day and adds fourteen years to his decreed lifespan. How safe (simple) are the hearts of the people! Among us are those who encompass a thousand and some twenty stars and no breath is taken from them nor is cut from their lifespan except for that. These stars are rotating however the placement of the Pole is from them. If I found among the Indians someone who could point to them with his finger, I would have been able to transfer them to what we know of the Greek and Arab constellations for the stars, or what approximates them if they are not of them.",

We begin with the description of this mountain as it is the center of the Dvipas and seas and the middle of 'Jambudvipa' among them. 'Brahmagupta' said: People's sayings have multiplied regarding the description of the earth and Mount 'Meru', especially from those who study the Puranas and religious books. Some of them describe this mountain as rising above the face of the earth excessively high, and that it is under the Pole and the stars rotate around its foot, so rising and setting occur from it. It was named Meru because of its power over that, and because the Head (Rahu) only eclipses the two luminaries by its power. The day of its inhabitants, the angels, is six months and their night is six months. He said: In the book of 'Jina', who is the 'Buddha': That Mount 'Meru' is square, not round. 'Balabhadra' the commentator said: Some people say: The earth is flat and Mount Meru is luminous and shining. He said: If it were as they claimed, the planets would not rotate around the horizon of those who inhabit Meru. And if it had rays, it would be seen due to its height as the Pole above it appears. Some of them say: It is of gold. Others say: It is of gem. 'Aryabhata' believes that it does not rise high, but rises one Yojana on a roundness not squareness. It is the kingdom of angels. It became invisible despite its rays because it is far from the lands, northern in all places in the cold regions in the middle of a desert called 'Nandana Vana'. If it were of great height...",

Balabhadra is weak in speech and meaning, so I do not know how he volunteered for interpretation, although his interpretations are like that. As for his invalidation of the flatness of the earth by the rotation of stars around the horizon of Meru, it is closer to affirmation. Rather, if it were flat and statures were parallel to the column of the mountain, the horizon would not change and it would be the equator in all places. As for what he narrated from Aryabhata, let the sphere of the earth be AB on center E, and A a dwelling whose latitude is sixty-six degrees. We isolate arc AB equal to the maximum declination, so B is the place aligned by the Pole. We pass on point A line AC touching the sphere, so it is in the plane of the sensible horizon where sights pass around the earth. We join AE and extend EBG meeting AC at C, and drop perpendicular AT on EC. It is known that AT is the sine of the maximum declination and TB is its versine (sagitta) and TE is the cosine of the maximum declination. Because we address 'Aryabhata', we work the sines also by his Kardajas (units), so AT is 1397 and TE is 3140 and BT is 298. Due to the right angle EAC, the ratio of EC to EA is like the ratio of EA to ET. The square of EA is 11,819,844 (using Aryabhata's Radius R=3438) and its dividend by TE (3140) is 3764 (approx). The difference between it and TE (should be EC - EB?) ... (Mathematical reconstruction: EC = R^2 / TE = 3438^2 / 3140 ≈ 3764. BC = EC - EB = 3764 - 3438 = 326. The text says difference between it and TB is 324 which is BC). And its ratio to BE assuming it is the total sine which is 3438 is like the ratio of 'Yojana' BC to Yojana BE, which is according to Aryabhata eight hundred. Its product in the previous difference: 259,200 (using 324*800) and its dividend by the total sine: 75. That is the Yojana of BC, and it would be six hundred miles and two hundred parasangs. If the column of the mountain were two hundred parasangs, the one ascending it would be close to double it. Whenever 'Meru' is of this magnitude, nothing of it appears at latitude sixty-six and it does not hide anything of the Tropic of Cancer at all. If it is there under the horizon, then in dwellings whose latitudes are less than that latitude, it is lowered from the horizons. So grant that it is the sun in light, is it seen while it is under the earth absent? For this mountain...",

The mountain is not hidden from us because of its distance in the cold highlands, but because of its being lower than the horizon due to the sphericity of the earth and the attraction of heavy things towards its center. Also, his inference of the mountain's low height by the appearance of the Tropic of Cancer in what equals in latitude the complement of the greatest declination is not necessary. Because we only knew the properties of the tropics and other things in those places by proof without viewing or transmission of a report, for those places are uninhabited and their paths are not traveled. If someone came to him from there informing him of the appearance of this tropic in that latitude, then someone has come to us informing us of the disappearance of part of it. There is no screen for that other than this mountain, and were it not for it, all of it would appear. So who made one of these two reports more worthy of acceptance? In the book of \"Aryabhata\" who is from \"Kusumapura\": Indeed Mount \"Meru\" is in \"Himavant\", which is the cold highlands, and does not exceed a \"Yojana\". It occurred in the translation: That it does not exceed Himavant by more than a Yojana. This man is not Aryabhata the Elder; rather, he is one of his followers, for he mentions him and follows him. I do not know which of the two namesakes \"Balabhadra\" means. In summary, the properties of the location of this mountain are known to us by proof, and the mountain itself according to them by reports, whether they made it a Yojana or more, and whether they made it square or octagonal. Let us mention now what the Rishis said about it.

It was mentioned in \"Aditya Purana\" regarding its side what preceded, but I did not find its height in it. It was said: Indeed its eastern side is of gold, the western of silver, the southern of red ruby, and the northern of various jewels. These excessive magnitudes for the mountain do not persist except with the excessive magnitudes they mentioned for the earth. If guessing is not limited, the field of slander for the guesser is open, like the commentator of the book of \"Patanjal\", for he exceeded the square in it to elongation (oblongness) and made one of its squares fifteen \"Koti Yojanas\", which is 150,000,000, and the other five Koti, on a third of the first. He mentioned regarding its four sides that in its east are Mount \"Malyavat\" and the sea, and between them are kingdoms called \"Bhadrasva\".

As for what is in the meanings, either something results from it that is desired to be understood and its subject matter, or the contradiction of everything that has no basis is known by it. We have mentioned the condition of the Middle Island where we mentioned what is around the mountain that is in its middle. It was named \"Jambu Dvipa\" «1» by the name of a tree in it whose branches extend a hundred \"Yojanas\". When mentioning the inhabited world and its division, its complete description will be. We will mention now the rest of the islands surrounding it, and we rely in the arrangement of names on what is in \"Matsya Purana\" for the reason we mentioned, after mentioning regarding the Middle one something that is in \"Vayu Purana\", which is that in \"Madhyadesha\" (Middle Land?) they claimed two genera. One of them is called \"Kimpurusha\"; their men are known by the color of gold and their women \"Srinari\" [?]. They live a long life, do not get sick for the duration of their life, do not commit a sin, and do not envy each other. Their food is what they squeeze from the fruit of a palm called \"Madhu\". The other genus is \"Harivarsha\", on the color of silver. They live eleven thousand years, do not grow beards, and their food is sugar cane. From the perspective of what was mentioned of the lack of beard and the color of gold and silver, the mind went to the Turks, but «2» from the perspective of feeding...",

In the Zanj (Black Africans) is something of that, which is that they have no grief and no envy among them because they do not own anything by which that occurs. Life among them is inevitably longer than it is in our lands, but slightly, not reaching doubles. Even if the Zanj, due to their dullness, do not know a natural death but attribute it to poison only and follow it with accusations if the dead was not killed by a weapon. This is when «1» a consumptive spits it. So let us come now to \"Shaka Dvipa\" «2». In it, according to what is in \"Matsya Purana\", are seven great rivers; one of them is parallel in purity «3» to Ganges. In the first sea are seven mountains possessing jewels; some inhabited by \"Dev\" and some by devils. Among them is a towering golden one from which the cloud rises then comes to us and rains. Among them is one possessing all medicines, and from it \"Indra\" the Chief takes the rain. Among them is one called \"Soma\". Of its story: \"Kashyapa\" had two wives, one of them \"Kadru\" mother of the snakes, and the other \"Vinata\" mother of the birds. They were in the desert and in it was a gray horse. The mother of the snakes said: It is black. They bet on the enslavement of the liar and delayed the examination until the morrow. The mother of the snakes sent her black children by night until they twisted on it and covered its color. So the mother of the birds was enslaved for a time. She had two sons, one of them \"Aruna\" the guardian of the Rukh of the Sun drawn by horses, and the other \"Garuda\" «4». This one said to his mother: Ask the children of your co-wife by what your emancipation is possible. She did. They said to her: By the Amrita (Nectar) which is with \"Dev\". Then \"Garuda\" «5» flew to Dev and asked them for it. They answered him that Amrita is of their specialties, and if obtained by others, they would remain as long as they remain. He pleaded with them to enable him with it just until he frees his mother with it then returns it. They had mercy on him and gave it to him. He came to Mount \"Soma\" and they intended «6» it. He gave it to them and freed his mother, then said...",

He said: The people of that land are righteous, long-lived, having dispensed with the policy of kings by abandoning envy and conflict. Their time is all \"Treta Yuga\", not changing. In them are the four colors, meaning the distinct classes; they do not intermarry and do not mix. They are always joyful, not grieving.

Another mountain is called \"Hari\", like the black cloud. In it is a fire called \"Mahisha\" which came out of the water and inhabited it until the time of the annihilation of the world, and it is the one that burns it. In it are seven kingdoms and uncounted rivers flowing to the sea; \"Indra\" takes them for rain. Among the great ones is \"Jumna\" [?], purifier from sins. Nothing of its people was mentioned in it.

They do not get sick and do not grieve. They have dispensed with kings by rejecting competition in acquisition and became content, so they became safe. They chose beauty and loved good. The air does not change for them with heat or cold necessitating protection. They do not have rain; rather water springs for them from the earth and seeps from the mountains. Such is the condition of what is beyond it of the Dvipas. They are one genus not distinguished by classes. Each one of them lives three thousand «3» years. In Vishnu Purana: Indeed they are beautiful of face, worship \"Bhagavat\", and sacrifice to the fire. Each one lives ten thousand «3» years.

It extends guiding, spread out, clear, surrounding places like islands until it reaches \"Al-Mansura\", which is between its branches. It pours into the sea in two places, one of them at the city of \"Lohrani\" and the other more inclined to the East in the borders of \"Kutch\". It is known as Sindhu Sagara, meaning the Sea of Sindh. Just as the meeting of the five rivers was named here, likewise the rivers flowing from the mentioned mountains towards the North, as when they gathered at Termez and the river of \"Balkh\" [Oxus/Amu Darya] came from them, were named the Meeting of the Seven Rivers. The Magians of Sogdia mixed both «1» matters and said: Indeed the sum of the seven rivers is \"Sindh\", and its highest is \"Baridish\" [?]. He who descends it sees the decline of the sun on his right if he faces the West, as we see it here on our left. As for the river \"Sarsat\" [Sarasvati], it falls into the sea east of \"Somnath\" by the amount of a bowshot. The water of \"Jumna\" [Yamuna] pours into the river \"Ganges\" below the city of \"Kannauj\", which is on its west. Then the two combined fall into the Great Ocean at \"Gangasagara\". Between the mouths of the rivers Sarsat and Ganges is the mouth of the river \"Narmada\". It comes from eastern mountains and extends on the South to the West and falls into the sea near the town of \"Bharuch\", which is east of Somnath by close to sixty Yojanas. Behind the water of Ganges is the water of \"Rahab\" and the water of \"Kuhini\" [?]. They gather to the water of \"Saru\" [Saryu] near the town of \"Bari\". Among the belief of the Indians regarding the river Ganges: That its course was in ancient times on the land of Paradise. The news of its descent to the earth will come. It was said in \"Matsya Purana\": Indeed Ganges, when it settled on the earth, divided into seven branches. The middle of them is its column known by this name.

Rather, it is in necessary things with them like the alignment of feather to feather (perfect match) and with precision without similarity. It also did not contain anything of what was disputed and despaired of reaching of what resembles histories. Even though Islam was plotted against in its beginnings by a group of its opponents who manifested it by pretense and narrated to those of sound hearts from their books what Allah did not create anything of in them, neither little nor much. So they believed them and wrote it from them, deceived by their hypocrisy, and left what they had of the True Book because the hearts of the common people are more inclined to superstitions, so the reports became confused because of that. Then another calamity came from the side of the heretics (Zanadiqah), the followers of \"Mani\", like Ibn al-Muqaffa' and like Abdul Karim ibn Abi al-Awja' and their likes. They made those of weak instincts doubt the First One from the perspective of justice and injustice, and inclined them to Dualism, and adorned for them the biography of Mani until they held fast to his rope. He is a man not restricted by his ignorances in his doctrine without speaking on the form of the world with what reveals his deceptions. That spread on tongues and was added to what preceded of Jewish plots, so it became an opinion attributed to Islam—Glory be to Allah from its like—and he who opposes it and holds fast to the Truth conforming to the Qur'an regarding it is branded with disbelief and atheism, his blood judged to be spilled, not permitted to have his speech heard.

The prolongation of partisanship might incline us with it from the ideal path for zealotry. May Allah make firm the foot of him who intends Him and intends the Truth in it. As for the Indians, their religious books and informative Puranas all speak on the form of the world with what contradicts the clear truth according to their astrologers. Except that the people, due to them, are compelled in establishing the laws and carrying the great majority on them to astrological calculations and judicial warnings. So they show inclination to them and speak of their virtue and seek blessing by meeting them and declare decisively that they are of the people of Paradise, none of them entering Hell. Their astrologers reward them with belief and conformity to what they are upon, even if most of it opposes the truth, and undertake for them what is needed from them. Therefore, the two opinions mixed over days, and the speech obtained with the astrologers became disordered, especially with those who imitate and take principles by reports and do not go in them the way of verification, and they are the majority of them. Let us narrate now what they are upon and say: Indeed the heaven and the world according to them are round, and the earth is spherical in shape. Its northern half is dry land and its southern half is submerged in water. Its magnitude with them is greater than what it is with the Greeks. Among what the moderns found and find, they have deviated in it from mentioning the seas and Dvipas and the many Yojanas estimated for it, and followed the owners of the creed in what is not impugning the art (astronomy) regarding Mount \"Meru\" being under the North Pole and the island of \"Vadavamukha\" under the South Pole. As for the Mountain, whether it is there or not, since what is needed from it is the properties of the millstone rotation, and they are, due to the zenith alignment, existing for the place on the surface of the earth and for what is at its zenith in the air. As for the Southern Island, it is likewise a harmless report. However, it is possible, indeed like the necessary, that two quarters of the quarters of the earth are dry land and the other two are submerged in water.

If the wordings oppose what is customary, let the meanings be considered by them, for they are the sought. \"Paulisa\" said in his \"Siddhanta\": Indeed Paul «1» the Greek mentioned in a place: That the earth is spherical in shape. And he said in another place: That it is planar (disk-like). He was truthful in both, because roundness is in its surface and straightness is in its diameter. He did not believe in it other than sphericity by many proofs from his speech and the consensus of scholars on that, such as \"Varahamihira\", \"Aryabhata\", \"Deva\", \"Srishena\", \"Vishnuchandra\" «2», and \"Brahm\". For if it were not round, the latitudes of places would not be marked, nor would day and night differ in summer and winter, nor would the conditions of planets and their orbits be found as they were found. As for its place, it is the center. Half of it is clay and half of it is water. Mount \"Meru\" is in its dry half, the dwelling of \"Dev\", the angels. Above it is the North Pole. In its half submerged in water under the South Pole is \"Vadavamukha\", and it is dry land like an island, inhabited by \"Daitya\" and \"Naga\", the relatives of the angels who are in Meru. Therefore, it was also named \"Daityantara\". The line separating the dry and wet halves of the earth is called \"Niraksha\", meaning that which has no latitude, and it is the Equator. In its four directions are four great cities. As for in the East, \"Yamakoti\". As for in the South, \"Lanka\" «3». In the West, \"Romaka\". And in the North, \"Siddhapura\". The earth is fastened by the two poles, and the axis holds it. If the sun rises on the line passing through \"Meru\" and \"Lanka\", that time is noon for \"Yamakoti\", midnight for Rum (Romaka), and evening for Siddhapura. Aryabhata says likewise. \"Brahmagupta son of Jishnu\" of Bhillamala said in \"Brahma Siddhanta\": Indeed the sayings of people have multiplied regarding the form of the earth, especially among those who study the Puranas and the religious books. Some of them see that it is like a mirror, flat. Some of them see that it is like a bowl, hollow. Some of them claim that it is level...",

The magnitude of every sea of them or land is double that which is inside it, until the furthest land is sixty-four times like the middle land, and the furthest surrounding sea is sixty-four times the nearest surrounding sea. However, the difference of rising and setting, such that one in \"Yamakoti\" sees the single star at the single time on the horizon of the West, and one in Rum sees it then on the horizon of the East rising, is among what necessitates the shape of the sphere for the heaven and the earth. Likewise, the seeing of one in \"Meru\" of the single star at the single time on the horizon in the direction of \"Lanka\" «1», the homeland of the devils, and the seeing of one in \"Lanka\" «1» of it above their heads, indicates the like of it. Then calculations are not correct except with it. So by necessity we say: Indeed the heaven is a sphere because of our finding its properties in it, and indeed these properties are not correct in the world except with its being a sphere. So the invalidity of other sayings regarding it is not hidden then. \"Aryabhata\" investigates the world and says: It is earth, water, fire, and wind, and they are all round. Likewise \"Vasishtha\" and \"Lata\" say: Indeed the five elements, which are earth, water, fire, wind, and heaven, are round. \"Varahamihira\" says: Indeed the apparent sensed things testify to sphericity for it and negate other shapes from it. \"Aryabhata\", \"Paulisa\", \"Vasishtha\", and \"Lata\" have agreed that if it is noon in \"Yamakoti\" «2», it is then midnight in Rum, the beginning of the day in \"Lanka\" «2», and the beginning of the night in \"Siddhapura\". This is not possible except on circularity. Likewise, the times of eclipses are not consistent except on it. \"Lata\" said: Every place on the earth, only half the sphere of the heaven is seen in it. According to the latitude in the North, \"Meru\" and the Pole rise on the horizon as they descend according to the latitude in the South. In both of them, the Equator descends from the zenith according to the latitude. Everyone who is in a direction of the two directions, North and South, does not...",

These are their sayings regarding the sphericity of the heaven and the earth and what is between them, and the earth being in the center of the world with a very small magnitude compared to what is seen of the heaven. These are the principles of the science of astronomy which the first book of the Almagest contains, and what resembled it of other books, even if they are not with the verification and refinement that we follow. That is because the earth is heavier than water, and water is fluid like air. The spherical shape of the earth is necessary, natural, unless a divine command removes it from it. It is not possible that the earth moves aside towards the North and the water towards the South so that half the total is dry land and half of it is water except after hollowing out the dry land. As for us, our inductive finding necessitates dryness in one of its two Northern quarters, and for its sake we infer the like of that in the quarter diagonal to it. We allow the island of \"Vadavamukha\" but do not necessitate it because its matter and the matter of Meru is report-based. As for the Equator, it is not, in the quarter known to us, on the common separation between land and sea. For the land crowds the sea in places, so it enters it an entry by which it crosses the Equator, like the deserts of the \"Sudan\" (Blacks) of the West (Africa), because they butted the sea and entered it to places behind the Mountains of the Moon and the sources of the Nile. We did not verify them because from the land side they are a wilderness not traveled, and from the sea side behind Sofala of the Zanj likewise; no ship returned from there having risked itself so as to report what it witnessed. Likewise, there enters it from the land of India above the lands of Sindh a great piece in which it is imagined that it crosses the Equator to the South. Between that is the land of the Arabs and Yemen on this image without penetration into the sea crossing the Equator. Just as the land enters the sea, likewise the sea enters the land and pierces it in places and makes it gulfs and inlets «1», as it spread a tongue from the west of the land of the Arabs to near the middle of al-Sham (Syria) and tapered at al-Qulzum, so it was known by it. And another greater than it from the east of their land known as the Sea of \"Fars\" (Persian Gulf). It also bent between the lands of India and China, a bending to the North greatly. Thus the shape of the coast departed by that from sticking to the Equator or being at a distance...",

What was mentioned of the difference of times is from the consequences of the sphericity of the earth and its adhering to the middle of the world. If its inhabitants were mentioned with it—and cities must have civilized inhabitants—that would be from the consequences of the inclination of weights towards its center, which is the middle of the world. What is in \"Vayu Purana\" approximates it: That noon at \"Amaravati\" is sunrise at \"Vibhavari\" [?], midnight at \"Sukha\" [?], and sunset at \"Samyamani\" [?]. And what is in \"Matsya Purana\": That it mentioned in it that from Mount \"Meru\" towards the East is the city of \"Amaravati Pura\", which belongs to \"Indra\" the Chief, and in it is his wife. Towards the South is the city of \"Samyamani Pura\", in which is \"Yama\", son of the Sun; he punishes people there and rewards them. Towards the West is the city of \"Sukha Pura\", in which is \"Varuna\", meaning Water. Towards the North for the Moon is \"Vibhavari Pura\". The Sun and the planets revolve around Meru. If the Sun is at the noon of Amaravati Pura, it is the beginning of the day in Samyamani Pura, midnight in Sukha, and the beginning of the night in Vibhavari Pura. If it is at the noon of Samyamani Pura, it is rising on Sukha Pura, setting on Amaravati Pura, and at midnight of Vibhavari Pura. His saying: \"Indeed the Sun revolves around Meru,\" means like a millstone for those on it. There is neither East nor West there due to the form of the movement, nor does the Sun rise in it from one specific place but from different places. He only pointed to the direction of a city and named it East, and to another direction and named it West. It is possible that these four cities are the ones their astrologers mentioned, but he did not clarify the distance between them and the Mountain. The rest of what we narrated from them is the truth which proof necessitates. But it is their custom not to mention the Pole unless this Mountain is mentioned with it in conjunction. They believe regarding the Low (Bottom) what we believe regarding it, that it is the center of the world, were it not that the expression for it is weak, especially since it is from the issues of the stalwarts which only great men undertake. \"Brahmagupta\" said: Indeed the scholars claimed that the sphere of the earth is in the middle of the heaven. From it is Mount \"Meru\", the dwelling of \"Dev\", and lower than it is \"Vadavamukha\", the dwelling of their opponents of...",

They did not go from this Low except to rank (hierarchy), otherwise the condition of the earth from all its directions is one, and everyone on it stands upright towards the High. Heavy things fall to it naturally just as holding things and preserving them is in its nature, flowing is in the nature of water, burning is in the nature of fire, and moving is in the nature of wind. If a thing seeks lowliness from the earth, let it go down, for there is no low other than it. Seeds descend to it wherever they are thrown and do not ascend from it. \"Varahamihira\" said: Indeed the mountains, seas, rivers, trees, cities, people, and angels are all around the sphere of the earth. It is not possible to say regarding the opposition of \"Yamakoti\" and \"Rum\" (Rome/Romaka) that it is lowliness, as there is no low. How can it be said regarding one of them that it is low while its condition is like the condition of the other? Neither of them is more worthy of falling; rather, each one in itself and to itself says \"I am the high one and the rest are low.\" All of them are around the sphere like the emergence of blossoms on the branches of the tree called \"Kadamba\", for they surround it. Each one in its place is like the example of the other; one of them does not hang down nor does another stand upright. The earth holds what is on it because it is low from all directions and the heaven is high in all directions. So the speech of the people in this chapter, as you see, issues from knowledge of correct laws, even if they compromised with the owners of reports and laws. For \"Balabhadra\" the Commentator says: Indeed the most correct of sayings, despite their multitude and difference, is that the earth and \"Meru\" and the zodiacal sphere are round. The \"Apta Puranakara\", meaning the Truthful Ones who follow the Purana, say: Indeed the earth is like the back of a tortoise; it has no roundness from below. He said: And they have spoken the truth, for the earth is in the middle of the water, and what appears of it is on the form of the back of a tortoise, and the sea surrounding it is not traveled. As for the roundness of the zodiacal sphere, it is witnessed by viewing. So look how he believed them in the roundness of the back and ignored their negation of roundness from the belly, and occupied himself with a talk unconnected to that. He said: Indeed the sight of man does not reach from the earth and its roundness five thousand «1» \"Yojanas\" except to a part of ninety-six parts of it, that is fifty-two...",

Those Truthful Ones did not deny the roundness of the back of the earth; rather, they established it by the example of the back of the tortoise. \"Balabhadra\" only denied it from their saying because he carried its meaning to the encompassing of water around it. What protrudes from the water is allowed to be spherical of face and [also] to be flat rising from the water like an inverted tambourine, meaning a segment of a round cylinder. As for roundness exiting from being sensed due to the smallness of man's stature, it is incorrect because even if the stature were like the column of the greatest mountain, then the contemplation was from one place on it without moving and using the method of measurement regarding what is found in it of the difference of conditions, its length would not benefit and one would not sense the roundness of the earth alone. But how does this speech connect to the doctrine of the people? If he had established roundness for the earth in the side opposite to roundness, meaning that which is below metaphorically, then mentioned what he mentioned to show it as intelligible benefited from sense, his saying would have had some face. As for his specifying the seen magnitude of the earth, let the sphere of the earth be for him: AB on center: E, and point: B of it the standing place of the viewer looking at what is around him, and the stature: BC, and CA comes out touching the earth. It is known that the seen is: BA. Let us assume it a part of ninety-six parts of the circumference, and that is three degrees and a half and a quarter of a degree if the circumference is three hundred and sixty. Like what preceded in the chapter of Mount \"Meru\", we divide the square of: TE (Hypotenuse/Secant?) which is 50625 by: 5 T (Cosine?) which is 3431, so TC comes out 1 «1» 4 45 (minutes?), and BC the stature is: «1» 7 45 (minutes?). That is on the basis that: EB the total Sine is: 3438. But the radius of the earth according to what was mentioned of its circumference: 795 27 16 (Yojanas?). If we convert: BC to it, it would be one Yojana «2» and six Krohs and one thousand and thirty-five «2» cubits. If we assumed: BC four cubits, its ratio to: AT by the magnitude of the Sine would be like the ratio of 57035 «3», which is the cubits of what came out for the stature, to: AT by the magnitude of the Sine which is 225.

But the share of one degree of the roundness of the earth as mentioned is thirteen Yojanas and seven Krohs and three hundred and thirty-three cubits and a third of a cubit. So the seen of the earth then is two hundred and ninety-one cubits and two-thirds of a cubit. The way from which \"Balabhadra\" was approached is what is in \"Paulisa Siddhanta\" when he cut the Sine for the quadrant of the circle into twenty-four Kardajas (segments). Then he said: If a questioner asks about the cause of that, let him know that one Kardaja of these is a part of ninety-six parts of the circumference, and its minutes are 225. When we extracted its sine, its minutes were 225. So we knew from that that sines equal their arcs in what is smaller than this Kardaja. Since the total Sine according to \"Paulisa\" and \"Aryabhata\" is on the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of three hundred and sixty, \"Balabhadra\" was deluded by this numerical equality and thought that the arc had become straight. Whatever does not have «1» a convexity, a protrusion preventing vision from passing, and did not become small, is perceived. This is the great error, for the arc never becomes straight nor...",

As for the saying of Paulisa regarding the earth: Indeed the axis holds it, he does not mean by it that a physical axis is there such that were it not for it the earth would fall. How could he say this when he sees the four cities around the earth inhabited, and those are necessitators of the descent of heavy things to the earth from all sides? But he meant by it that the movement of what is on the circumference is a cause for the stillness of what is in the center. Movement in the sphere is only on two poles, and the line connecting them seemingly is the axis. It is as if he says: Indeed the movement of the heaven is holding the earth in its place, making it natural for it, impossible to be in other than it. It is on the axis of movement, then on its middle, because the rest of the diameters of the sphere are possible to be imagined «1» as axes, for they are so potentially. If it were not in the middle, the existence of an axis away from it would be possible, so it is as if in the image it is supported by axes. As for the stillness of the earth, which is also one of the principles of astronomy where resolving the doubts occurring in it is difficult, they are also upon believing it. \"Brahmagupta\" said in \"Brahma Siddhanta\": Indeed some people claimed that the first movement is not in the meridian (Equator/Daily motion?), but rather it belongs to the earth. \"Varahamihira\" refuted them saying that that necessitates that a bird does not return to its nest whenever it flies from it towards the West. And it is as he said. Then Brahmagupta said in another place of it: Indeed the companions of \"Aryabhata\" say: Indeed the earth is moving and the heaven is resting. It was said in refuting them: Indeed if that were so, stones and trees would fall from it. Brahmagupta did not approve of that and said: Indeed it does not necessitate that for them. It is as if he meant by that from the perspective that heavy things are attracted to their center. He said: Rather, if that were so, the minutes of the heaven would not steal the \"Prana\" of times. Perhaps the confusion in this chapter is from the side of the translator. For the minutes of the heaven are: 21600 «2» and are called Pranas, meaning breaths, because they claim that every minute of the meridian...",

We narrate first their sayings in it, even if what we found of that is very little. \"Paulisa\" said: The Wind turns the sphere of the fixed stars, and the two Poles hold it. Its movement which is to the West is seen by the inhabitants of Mount \"Meru\" from left to right, and the inhabitants of \"Vadavamukha\" see it from right to left. He said in another place: If a questioner asks about the direction of the movement of the stars despite what he sees of their rising from the East and their rotation towards the West until they set, let him know that the movement which we see for them towards the West differs in direction according to the perception of the people of the dwellings of it. So the inhabitants of Mount \"Meru\" see it from left to right, and the people of the island of \"Vadavamukha\" find it the opposite of that, from right to left. The inhabitants of the Equator [see it] towards the West only. Those who are between these places [see it] inclined according to the latitudes of the dwellings. It is in summary issuing from the Wind which turns the spheres so the stars and others adhere to rising from the East and setting in the West accidentally. As for essentially, their movements are towards the East. This movement is the one which is from \"Ashvini\" (Sheratan) towards \"Bharani\" (Butain), for Bharani is to the East of Sheratan. If the questioner does not know the Lunar Mansions and is unable to measure the Eastern movement upon them, let him contemplate the Moon itself in its distancing from the Sun first by first, then its approaching it likewise until it conjoins it, to conceive from that its second movement. \"Brahmagupta\" said: Indeed the Sphere was created moving on two poles with the fastest...",

The stars were created where there was no Belly of the Fish (Andromeda/Pisces?) nor Sheratan (Aries), meaning in the common separation between them, which is the Vernal Equinox. \"Balabhadra\" the Commentator said: Indeed the whole world is suspended by two poles and moving with a rotation starting «1» from \"Kalpa\" «2» and ending at Kalpa «2». So it is not permissible to say regarding the world, due to the continuity of its movement: That it has no beginning and no end. \"Brahmagupta\" said: The place which has no latitude, and it is the one divided into sixty Ghatis (Kahris), is a horizon for one in \"Meru\". East in it becomes West. Behind this place in the South is \"Vadavamukha\", and the sea surrounds it. If the spheres and stars rotate, the Equator becomes a common horizon for the angels and for Daitya; they see it together. The direction of movement differs between them. What the angels see of it as moving to the right, \"Daitya\" see as moving to the left, and vice versa, on the example of one who has something in his right hand; if he looks into water, he sees it in his left hand. The cause of this even movement which does not increase nor decrease is a Wind. It is not the wind witnessed among us, for this one calms down and agitates and varies, and that one does not calm down. He also said in another place: And the Wind turns all the fixed and wandering stars towards the West in one rotation. The wandering ones (planets) move towards the East a slight movement on the example of an ant moving on the potter's wheel in the opposite direction of the turning. For what is seen of its movement is the turning, and its essential movement is not sensed. This is a saying agreed upon by \"Lata\", \"Aryabhata\", and \"Vasishtha\", except a group who saw movement for the earth and stillness for the heaven. As for the movement which people consider from the East to the West, the angels see it from left to right and Daitya from right to left. This is what I studied of their books regarding it. As for the Wind which they point to in moving, I think it is only for approximation to understandings, for it is witnessed in moving winged instruments and vanes when it blows on them.

Likewise, denying languor from it is an indication of its innocence of different conditions, for languor and fatigue only belong to the composite of opposites in quality. As for the preservation of the two poles for the sphere of fixed stars, its meaning is on order, not from falling. It was narrated about some of the ancient Greeks that he saw in the Milky Way that it was in some times a path for the Sun then it moved from it. This is the cessation of movements from the order which is possible to attribute to the preservation of the poles. As for the saying of \"Balabhadra\" regarding the finiteness of movement, its meaning is that what exits into existence falling under number is inevitably finite «1» from the perspective of its beginning, because number comes from the compositions of the One and its multiples, and it precedes them inevitably. And from the perspective of what exists of it in the 'Now' of time. That is a necessity. If the days and nights are increasing in number by the permanence of being, they have a first from which they began. If a denier denies their existence in the sphere and claims that day and night exist relative to the earth and its inhabitants, and that if they were lifted from the middle of the world, night and day would be lifted by their lifting, and enumeration would cease for the composites of their sums which are the days; Balabhadra turned away from inferring by the requirement of the first movement to the requirement of the second, which is the cycles of the planets, for they are relative to the sphere not the earth. He expressed it as Kalpa «2» because it is the collector of them and that which all of them begin from its start. As for the saying of \"Brahmagupta\" regarding the Equator: That it is the one divided into sixty, it is like the saying of a sayer if he were from our companions: That it is the one divided into twenty-four. That is because it is the measurer of times and the counter of them. Its rotation contains twenty-four hours as it contains according to the Indians sixty Ghatis (Kahris). Therefore, they calculated the ascensions of the Signs by Ghatis not by the times (degrees) of the Equator. As for his saying...",

    "text": "...regarding the Wind turning the fixed and wandering stars, then his specifying the wandering ones with the slight movement towards the East, it creates the illusion from him that he does not see a movement for the fixed ones. Otherwise, they also move a slight movement towards the East like the wandering ones; it does not differ from it except in magnitude and in the perplexity (retrograde) occurring to those in return. A group narrated about the ancients: That they did not realize their movements until long times guided them to them. What confirms that illusion is the emptiness of the cycles in his book of mentioning cycles for the fixed stars and his hanging their appearance and disappearance on degrees of the Sun that do not change. As for his negating right and left from the first movement for the one inhabiting the Equator, let it be known that the one dwelling under one of the poles, wherever he turns, faces the moving things. Because they are to one direction, they are necessarily taking from the alignment of one of his hands towards the direction of his face and from it to the alignment of the other hand. The matter is exchanged in the hands for the dwellers under both «1» poles due to their opposition, its exchange in water and the mirror. For sight, if reflected from them, becomes like another human opposite this viewer perceiving with his right his left and with his left his right. Likewise, the rest of the dwellings with Northern latitudes, their people face the moving things towards the South. And the Southern ones, their people face the moving things towards the North. So the matter of movement for them is on the analogy of the dwellers of \"Meru\" and \"Vadavamukha\". As for the one existing on the Equator, the moving things rotate over him approximately, so he does not face them in a direction. As for precisely, they distance from him a little. If he faced them in both directions in one form, the movement of the Northern ones over him would be from right to left, and the Southern ones contrary to that. So he combined the property of both poles together, and the exchange happened for him with himself not another. As for what rotated over his zenith, it is what \"Brahmagupta\" indicated of divisions. As for the sayings of the authors of the Puranas, they «2» made the heaven a dome over the earth, static, and the stars by themselves moving from East to West. So when would they have knowledge...",

We mention what reached us «1» from their side not for benefit, for there is no benefit in it. It was said in \"Matsya Purana\": Indeed the Sun and the stars pass towards the South with the speed of an arrow, revolving around Meru. The rotation of the Sun is on the example of a wood with a flaming end if you speed up its rotation. It does not set in itself, but hides from some people excluding others of the four cities which are in the four directions of the Mountain. It revolves around it to the North of Mount \"Lokaloka\"; it does not cross it nor illuminate its Southern side. Its hiding at night is because of its distance. A human might see it from thousands of \"Yojanas\", then a small thing hides it from him if the thing is close to the eye. If the Sun aligns with \"Pushkara Dvipa\" «2», it moves in three-fifths of an hour a part of thirty of the earth. So for this duration is twenty-one «3» Lakhs and fifty «4» thousand Yojanas, and that is 2,150,000. Then it inclines to the North, so its travel becomes three times what it was; therefore the day lengthens. The rotation of the Sun in the Southern day is nine \"Koti\" and ten thousand «5» and forty-five «6» Yojanas. If it returns to the North and rotates over \"Kshira\", meaning the Milky Sea, its day is three Koti and twenty-one \"Lakhs\". Look at the disorder of these sayings in the subject. Because his saying regarding the passing of stars: That they speed like an arrow, even if it is by way of exaggeration in description for common understanding, the South is not specialized with it excluding the North. If they have in both directions two limits for fluctuation, and the time of their passing from the Southern limit to the Northern limit equals the time of their passing between them conversely, their passing to the North is also with the speed of an arrow.

If he means by this passing the second movement, while that is the first, then the stars by it do not pass around \"Meru\" but incline from its horizon close to half a sixth of a rotation (30 degrees). Then how far is his example in the movement of the Sun by the flaming wood. If we were seeing the moving Sun as a connected round collar, his example would be useful in informing us that it is not so. As for when we see the Sun as a piece in the sky like standing, his example is nonsense. If he means by that that it makes a round orbit, the flaming in his wood is filler, for a stone suspended from the head of a string makes an orbit like it if spun above the head. The rising of the Sun on people and its absence from others is true were it not for what we mentioned of his belief. Mount \"Lokaloka\" and the falling of the sun's ray on it from its inner side which he named North and the outer South testifies against him. The hiding of the Sun at night is not due to distance, but by a screen which is the Earth for us and Mount Meru for him, but he conceived the orbit around the Mountain and we are in a side from it, so the distances from us to it differed. What is after that of speech testifies that it is originally thus and its hiding at night is not for its distance. As for the numbers that were mentioned, I think they are corrupt, changed, and we have no work with them. But he made the travel of the Sun in the North three times its travel in the South and made that the cause of the length of the day and its shortness, while the sum of the day and its night is always in its state, and they in the North and South compensate each other. It must be that what was mentioned is said regarding the latitude whose summer day is forty-five Ghatis and winter [day] is fifteen. Along with that, the speeding of the Sun in the North needs presenting a cause for it, for its positions narrow the Northern orbits due to their proximity to the Pole and widen the Southern ones due to their proximity to the Tail (skirt/edge). If the Sun speeds in the smaller distance, its time becomes shorter than the time of the larger distance, and it has slowed in it also, and the matter is the reverse. Then his saying: That if it rotated on \"Pushkara Dvipa\" «1» is an expression for the orbit of the Winter Solstice, and he has made the day in it...",

Similar to it is what is in \"Vayu Purana\": That the day in the South is twelve \"Muhurtas\" and in the North eighteen, and it inclines between the North and South 17,221 \"Yojanas\" in 183 days, so the share of the day is 94 Yojanas. As for Muhurta, it is four-fifths of an hour. The proposition is said regarding a latitude whose longest day is fourteen hours and a fifth of an hour. What was mentioned of the number of Yojanas, the apparent matter requires that it be the share of double the declination of the sphere. The declination with them is twenty-four parts, so the Yojanas of the whole sphere then are 129,157 and a half Yojanas. The days in which the Sun cuts double the declination are half its year with the fraction forced (rounded), for it is close to five-eighths of a day. In Vayu Purana: That the Sun in the North slows by day and speeds by night, and in the South conversely. Therefore, the day lengthens in the North and reaches eighteen Muhurtas. This is the speech of one who does not know the Eastern movement at all and is not guided to estimate the arc of the day by viewing. In the book \"Vishnu Dharma\": That the orbit of the Great Bear is below the Pole, and below it is the orbit of Saturn, then Jupiter, then Mars, then the Sun, then Venus, then Mercury, then the Moon. They rotate towards the East like a millstone with a movement of equal magnitude in every planet, because among them are fast and slow. Death and life have repeated on them in ancient times thousands of times. This speech, if it is intended to be conducted on the paths of correctness, is disordered. Because if we went regarding the being below of the Great Bear from the Pole to [the idea] that the place of the Pole is the High, the Great Bear is lower than the zenith of the heads of the people of \"Meru\", and he spoke truth in it. Then he lied regarding the wandering planets, for 'below' in them is said regarding nearness and distance from the earth. It will never be consistent on that «1» unless Saturn is the greatest of planets in declination of course «2» from the Equator, then Jupiter, then the rest of them the first then the first, and with that fixed on that amount of declination.

If they are added to the world, other names «1» obtain for them. Since rising and setting are in the horizon and the first movement appears by it, it is more appropriate for the directions to be defined in it. The four which are East, West, North, and South are famous. Those between every two of them are less famous. They with them become eight, and with Up and Down, which we do not occupy ourselves with mentioning, ten. As for the Greeks, they used to go in them to the risings of the Signs and their settings, then attribute them to the winds, so their number is sixteen. Likewise the Arabs attributed the four directions to the blowing places of the winds from them. What blew between two of them is \"Nakba'\" absolutely, and in special oddities named by special names. As for the Indians, they did not consider in them the blowing of a wind. They named the four directions first with names, then followed them with naming what is between every two directions of them, so they became eight in the horizon as in this image:\n[Image/Table]",

It was named by the name of a man, Bharata, who used to govern them and provision them. The people of this inhabited land are the ones upon whom reward and punishment fall, excluding others. This inhabited land is divided into nine divisions called \"Nava Khanda Prathama\", meaning the Nine First Pieces. Between every two of those pieces are seas in which one crosses from one to another. The width of the inhabited land from North to South is a thousand \"Yojanas\". His indication here to Himavant is to the mountains that are in the North at the cut-off of habitation due to cold; habitation is necessarily to its south. His indication to its people that they are the obligated ones is proof of the removal of obligation from others. Its removal is only by rising from humanity to the rank of angels who, by the simplicity of their substances and purity of their natures, do not disobey a command and do not weary of worship, or by descending from it to the rank of beasts that do not reason. So there is no one of mankind outside the inhabited land then. Bharata Varsha is not the land of India only, like the belief of the Indians regarding it that it is the World and they are the People only. No sea penetrates their land by which a piece in it is distinguished from a piece. One does not go in cutting to the Dvipas (Islands), for he declared that those seas are crossed in from side to side.

For the sixth Sindh and \"Sauvira\". For the seventh \"Harahaura\". For the eighth \"Madra\". For the ninth \"Kulinda\". All of these are regions of the land of India, not others. As for the names of the countries, most of them are different from what they are known by now. \"Utpala\" the Kashmiri commented on the book \"Samhita\" and said in this chapter: The names of countries change, especially in the Yugas. For \"Multan\" used to be called \"Kasyapapura\", then \"Hamsapura\", then \"Bagapura\", then \"Sambhapura\", then \"Mulasthana\", meaning the Original Place, for \"Mula\" is the root and \"Sthana\" is the place. The matter of the Yuga is of long duration, but names are quick to change when strangers of different language take over the place. Their tongues might falter in them, so they transfer them to their language like the custom of the Greeks, or take them by meaning, so the names vary. Do you not see that Shash (Tashkent) is taken from its name in Turkish which is \"Tashkand\", meaning the Village of Stone? Thus is its name in the book Geographia \"The Tower of Stone\". So they differ if they express them by their meanings or convert them to what is easy for them of letters and words, like the action of the Arabs in Arabizing names, so they become distorted, like \"Pushang\" in their books as \"Fusanja\", and like \"Sagalakand\" as \"Farfaz\" in their diwans. How far and grave the matter is! Rather, we find the single language itself in the single nation itself changing, so strange things appear in it that only the rare person understands, and that in a few years without anything happening to them to necessitate that. However, the Indians intend to multiply names and use derivation in them and boast of it. As for what is mentioned in \"Vayu Purana\" of the names of...",

What they mentioned regarding the rising and setting in it indicated that between Yamakoti and Rum (Rome/Byzantium) is half a circle. It is as if they counted the lands of the Maghreb as part of Rum due to their opposition on the two coasts. Otherwise, the lands of Rum possess latitudes and penetrate deep into the North, and none of them has little latitude, let alone being on the Equator as they mentioned. We have finished mentioning \"Lanka\". As for Yamakoti, it is in the place where Yaqub and Al-Fazari mention that there is a city in the sea called \"Tara\". I did not find any trace of this name in Indian books at all. Because \"Kot\" is the name of the fortress and \"Yama\" is the Angel of Death, scents of \"Kang-diz\" waft from it, which the Persians mention that \"Kay Ka'us\" or \"Jam\" built in the furthest East beyond the sea, and that \"Kay Khusraw\" crossed to it following \"Afrasiyab\" the Turk, and went to it at the time of asceticism and leaving the kingdom. That is because \"Diz\" in Persian is the name of the fortress. Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi based his Zij (astronomical table) on this place. As for Siddhapura, I do not know from where they extracted it. They do not disagree with us that beyond the inhabited half-circle are untraversed seas. As for latitude, no statement from them defining it has reached me. The saying that the longitude of the Inhabited World is half a circle is one of the common opinions among the people of the art (astronomers), but they differ in it regarding the starting point. The Indian opinion, if considered from the perspective of what is known to us, which is the city of \"Ujjain\", they placed it at the quarter from the eastern limit, and the limit of the completion of the second quarter is before the cessation of habitation in the direction of the West, as we will mention regarding the difference between the two longitudes. The opinion of the Westerners (Maghrebis/Muslim astronomers) is of two types. One is taken from the coast of the Surrounding Ocean (Atlantic), and the completion of the quarter from it would be around \"Balkh\". Therefore, when he gathered what cannot be gathered, he made Al-Shaburqan and Ujjain on one meridian. Far from it is what cannot be verified.",

Whenever the earth is in its natural shape, no place deserves the name Cupola more than another, except by way of analogy due to the equality of distance of the two ends of habitation from it in the directions of East and West, like the equality of distances of the tent skirts from the head of the tent or the cupola.

Beyond that is Mount Meru. The city of Ujjain is the one mentioned in the tables of countries as \"Arin\" on the sea (likely confusion with Uzain/Ujjain as zero meridian but Arin is erroneous transcription of Ujjain). However, between it and the coast is close to a hundred Yojanas. It is also not as assumed by those of our astronomers who do not distinguish, that it is on the meridian of Al-Shaburqan which is one of the districts of Guzgan; rather, it is east of this district by many time degrees of the Equator. Its matter is confused only for those who mix different opinions regarding the origins of the longitude of the Inhabited World in the directions of East and West and are not guided to distinguish them. No one who roamed the sea around the place indicated for this fortress and traveled on its path informed us of news of it matching their reports or resembling them so that it becomes closer to possibility by hearing.

It is recounted that some of them foresee its agitation before it happens, then time its reaching region after region.

He who hovers around verification in this chapter intends what is between the meridians of the two towns. As for our companions (astronomers), they take times (degrees) which are from the Equator, and what resembles them between the mentioned two circles from the parallel of one of the towns, and they call it \"The Difference Between Two Longitudes\" because they take the longitude of every town as its distance in its parallel from the great circle passing through the pole of the Equator chosen at the limit of habitation. The choice of them is in the West. Whether these times are taken assuming the circle is three hundred and sixty, or taken as sixty to be minutes of days, or taken as parasangs or Yojanas according to what is for the whole circle. The Indians have operations for that; what we have of them has not settled on one matter but differed. Despite their difference, it is apparent from their state that they deviate from correctness. Just as we preserve for every town its longitude, they preserve for it the Yojana distance from the meridian of the city of \"Ujjain\", western deserving addition or eastern deserving subtraction. They call it \"Desantara\", meaning the difference between kingdoms. They multiply it by the motion of the planet in the mean for a day and divide the amount by 4800. The result is what pertains to those Yojanas from the motion of the planet, I mean what must be added to its mean derived for the noon of Ujjain or its night so it transfers from it to the intended town. As for the number they divide by, it is the Yojanas of the circumference of the earth, because the ratio of the distance between the meridians of the two towns to the distance of the circumference of the whole earth is like the ratio of what the planet travels between the two towns...",

When the circumference is 4800, the diameter is close to 1527, although according to \"Paulisa\" it is 1600, and according to \"Brahmagupta\" 1581 in Yojanas, meaning each of them is eight miles. In the Zij of Arkand it is 1050, but this number in the accounts of Ibn Tariq is for the radius of the earth, and the whole diameter is 2100 assuming one of them is four miles, and its circumference is 6596 and nine twenty-fifths. As for Brahmagupta, he used the number 4800 in the Zij \"Khandakhadyaka\". As for in his correction, he used the rectified circumference of the earth instead, agreeing with Paulisa. Its rectification is to multiply the Yojanas of the earth's circumference by the sine of the complement of the town's latitude (cosine latitude) and divide the amount by the total sine. The result is the rectified circumference of the earth, which is the Yojanas of the parallel of the town, and perhaps it is called \"The Collar of the Parallel\". Because of this, it might occur to the imagination that 4800 is the rectified circumference of the earth for the city of \"Ujjain\", but if we test it, its latitude comes out as sixteen degrees and a quarter degree, and the latitude of Ujjain is not so; it is twenty-four degrees. The author of the Zij \"Karanatilaka\" went in this rectification to multiplying the diameter of the earth by twelve and dividing the total by the equinoctial shadow in the town. The ratio of the gnomon to this shadow is like the ratio of the radius of the town's parallel to the sine of the town's latitude, not to the total sine. The author of this operation only went to the equivalence of ratio which the Indians call \"Vyastatrairasika\", meaning positions by reversion (Inverse Rule of Three). Their example in it is that if the wage of a harlot when she is fifteen years old, for example, is ten dirhams, how much will it be when she becomes forty? His method is to multiply the first by the second and divide the result by the third; the fourth comes out, her wage at middle age, three dirhams and a half and a quarter. Likewise, when he found the equinoctial shadow increasing with the increase of latitudes and the diameter of the parallel decreasing, he thought there was a proportionality between this increase and decrease. Therefore, he set the decrease of the diameter of the parallel from the diameter of the earth according to the increase of the equinoctial shadow.

The Yojanas between the two towns come out, which is correct, but what comes out is what is on the great circle on which \"Lanka\" is. \"Brahmagupta\" does likewise, multiplying by 4800, and its mention has preceded. Their intent and purposes have been known up to this point, whether their work in it is correct or flawed. As for extracting \"Desantara\" from the latitudes of the two towns, Al-Fazari mentioned it in his Zij. It is to sum the squares of the sines of the latitudes of the two towns and take the square root of the sum, which is the Share (Hissah). Then the difference between these two sines is squared and added to the Share, and the total is multiplied by eight and the result divided by 377. The Grand Distance between them comes out. Then the difference between the two latitudes is multiplied by the Yojanas of the earth's circumference, and the amount is divided by three hundred and sixty. It is known that this is the conversion of what is between the latitudes from the amount of degrees and minutes to the amount of Yojanas. He said: The square of what comes out is subtracted from the square of the Grand Distance, and the square root of the remainder is taken; it will be the Straight Yojanas. It is apparent that it is what is between the meridians of the two towns on the parallel. It is known from it that the Grand is the distance between the two towns. This operation is found in the Indian Zijes agreeing with what we narrated except in one thing, which is that the mentioned Share is the square root of the difference between the squares of the sines of the two latitudes, not their sum. However the work was, it deviates from correctness. We have fulfilled it in several books of ours restricted to this meaning. It is known from them that by the two latitudes alone, neither the distance between the two towns nor the longitude between them is known, unless one of these two is known, so the other is known from it and the two latitudes. An example of this operation was found unattributed to its author: that if the Yojanas between the two kingdoms are multiplied by nine and the amount is divided by the difference between one (and?) the square root of the difference between its square and the square of the difference between the two latitudes, and divided by six, the minutes of days between the two longitudes come out.

But its double, which is 6400, is close to what Ibn Tariq mentioned, falling short of it by only nearly two hundred Yojanas. Let us now say according to what is correct with us regarding the latitudes of some places... It is agreed upon in their Zijes (astronomical tables) that the line connecting \"Lanka\" and Mount \"Meru\" bisects the habitation in longitude and passes through the city of \"Ujjain\", the fortress of \"Rohitaka\", the river \"Yamuna\", the plain of \"Thanesar\", and the cold mountains. From this line, the distances of cities in longitude are taken. I did not find any disagreement among them regarding it except what is in the book of \"Aryabhata\" of Kashmir, and this is his wording: People say that \"Kurukshetra\", meaning the plain of Thanesar, is on the line passing from Lanka to Meru through the city of Ujjain, and they attribute it to \"Paulisa\". He is too excellent for that to be hidden from him, for the times of the eclipse belie that. \"Prithusvami\" claims that the difference between the two longitudes contains one hundred and twenty Yojanas. This is what Aryabhata said. As for Yaqub bin Tariq, he said in \"Tarkib al-Aflak\" (Composition of the Spheres): The latitude of Ujjain is four degrees and three-fifths. He did not mention to us whether it is in the North or the South. Then he narrated in it from the Arkand that it is four degrees and two-fifths of a degree. As for us, we found it in the Arkand in an example of what is between Ujjain and Al-Mansura, and he expressed it as Brahmanabad, which is \"Bahmanwa\". As for the latitude of Ujjain, it is twenty-two degrees and twenty-nine minutes. As for the latitude of Al-Mansura, it is twenty-four degrees and one minute. He mentioned for \"Lohaniyya\", which is \"Lohrani\" (?), that the equinoctial shadow is five digits and three-fifths of a digit. It is agreed upon in the Zijes regarding the latitude of Ujjain that it is twenty-four degrees, the sun aligns with it at the summer solstice. \"Balabhadra\" the commentator mentioned that the latitude of \"Kannauj\" is 26:35...",

He built upon that his doctrine which originated from him. He differentiated between Time (Zaman) and Duration (Muddah) by the application of number to one of them and not the other, due to what attaches to number of finiteness, just as philosophers made Time a duration for what has a beginning and an end, and Eternity (Dahr) a duration for what has no beginning and no end. He mentioned that the five in this existing existence are necessary. For what is sensed in it is Matter formed by composition, and it occupies space, so there must be a Place. The variation of states upon it is among the necessities of Time, for some of them are prior and some posterior, and by Time precedence and event, and the older and newer, and simultaneity are known, so there must be it. In existence there are living beings, so there must be a Soul. And among them are rational beings, and the Artifice is of utmost perfection, so there must be the Wise, Knowing, Perfecting, Rectifying Creator to the utmost possible extent, pouring forth the power of intellect for salvation. Among the people of speculation are those who made the meaning of Eternity and Time one, and applied finiteness to the motion that counts it. And among them are those who assigned Eternity (Sarmad) to circular motion, so it adhered to the moving object by it inevitably, and it possessed the honor of permanent subsistence. Then he ascended from the moving object to its mover, and from the moved mover to the First Mover who does not...",

Were it not so, those differing in it would not have become extremely divergent, to the point that some said: There is no Time at all; and some said: It is a substance self-subsistent. Alexander of Aphrodisias says: \"Aristotle\" demonstrated in the book \"Physics\" (Al-Sama' al-Tabi'i) that every moving object is moved by a mover. \"Galen\" says in his face (countering him): He did not explain it, let alone demonstrate it. As for the Indians, their speech in this chapter is scant and unverified. \"Varahamihira\" said at the beginning of the book \"Samhita\" when mentioning what has pre-eternity: It has been said in the ancient books that the first thing and the oldest is Darkness, which is not blackness but rather non-existence like the state of a sleeper. Then Allah created this world for the sake of \"Brahma\" as a dome for him, and made it two parts, upper and lower, and ran the sun and moon in it. \"Kapila\" said: Allah and the world with Him, with its substances and bodies, have always existed, but He is a cause for the world and is superior by His subtlety over its density. \"Kumbhaka\" (?) said: The Eternal is \"Mahabhuta\", meaning the sum of the five elements. Others said pre-eternity belongs to Time. Some said to Nature. Others claimed that the Governor is \"Karma\", meaning Action. In the book \"Vishnu Dharma\", \"Vajra\" said to Markandeya: Clarify the times for me. He answered him that Duration is \"Atman Purusha\", meaning his spirit, and Purusha is the Owner of the Whole. Then he began clarifying for him the partial times and their lords as we presented each one in its chapter. The Indians divided Duration into two times: a movement that estimated Time, and a rest that could be estimated by imagination parallel to the First Moving Estimator. The Eternity of the Creator became for them estimated but not counted due to the negation of finiteness from it, although imagining an estimated uncounted thing is very difficult and far-fetched. We will mention from their sayings in this chapter according to our knowledge what suffices. As for what circulates among them of the mention of Creation, it is common (popular/vulgar), because we have recounted their opinion on the eternity of Matter. So they do not mean by creation origination from nothing, but they mean by it the artifice in the clay (matter) and the bringing about of compositions in it, forms, and managements leading to intended purposes and goals in it. Therefore, they attribute creation to angels and Jinn, even humans, either fulfilling the right of a benefactor or out of satisfaction...",

This is like the saying of \"Plato\" in \"Timaeus\": The gods who undertook the creation of man, when their father commanded them, took a non-mortal soul and made it a beginning, then turned a mortal body over it. Here is a duration our companions call \"Years of the World\" according to the doctrine of the Indians. It is thought from it that Creation and Annihilation are at its two ends by way of origination (from nothing). The subject of the people is not that, but rather it is the Day of \"Brahma\", followed by a Night like it for him, because Brahma is entrusted with bringing into being (growth). Growing is a movement in the growing thing from another, and its most apparent causes are the upper movers, I mean the planets. They will not be influential in what is beneath them with moderate influences except with their movement and the changing of their positions in every direction. That is restricted to the Day of Brahma because the planets according to them are traveling in it and their spheres rotating according to the system destined for them, and growth is therefore continuous on the face of the earth. In the Night of Brahma, the spheres rest from their movements, and all planets settle in one place with their apogees and nodes. The earthly conditions therefore become a single state that does not vary. So growth ceases by the rest of the Grower and the suspension of action and passivity. The elements rest from transformations and mixtures, their rest now in... and they prepare by their purity for the resumed existences in the future Day. The matter revolves on that for the duration of the life of \"Brahma\" as we will recount in its place. So Creation and its Annihilation according to them occur from this perspective on the face of the earth without obtaining by creation in existents the existence of clay (matter) that was not, nor at annihilation the non-existence of clay that was.

Their phrasing is not denounced for applying to what has a beginning and an end in its duration. The sum of Brahma's life, with the alternation of movement and rest in the world during it, counts for existence, not non-existence, due to the presence of clay in it, indeed the Form also with it. Brahma's entire life is a Day not followed by (Night? or not elevated?), so when he dies, compounds dissolve in his Night, and what Nature was entrusted to preserve is suspended due to its vanishing. That is the rest of \"Purusha\" and his vehicles. Their commoners followed the Night of Purusha with the Night of Brahma in description. And because Purusha is the name of Man, they attached sleep and waking to him, and established for annihilation from his sleep a snoring by which every connected thing breaks, and sweat of the forehead in which every standing thing drowns, and such things that minds reject and ears spit out. Therefore, their elite did not share with them in it, knowing the reality of sleep and that the body composed of opposing humors needs it for rest and the return of every needy thing to its natural place, like its need due to constant dissolution for eating to restore what dissolved, and due to its mortality for intercourse to perpetuate the species by replacement, and other evils we are compelled to, which simple substances dispense with, and He who is above them, there is nothing like unto Him. They also claimed regarding Annihilation and the corruption of the world that it is by the gathering of the twelve suns that alternate now in the months, and their insistence on the earth with burning and calcination, drying up moistures and desiccation. Then the gathering of the four types of rains that alternate now in the seasons until the calcined is attracted by the driving to itself and dissolves by it. Then the disappearance of light and the dominance of darkness and non-existence until it becomes dust and scatters.

It is known from the content of these stories that this annihilation is at the end of a Kalpa. Abu Ma'shar's opinion on the Flood at the conjunction of planets is adapted from them, because this configuration for them exists at the end of every \"Chaturyuga\" and at the beginning of every \"Kaliyuga\", even if it is not at the utmost perfection. Thus, there is no doubt that the Flood is also not for complete extermination and destruction. Whenever we delve deeper into the chapters, these meanings increase in openness and these names and terms in clarity and exposition. Al-Iranshahri narrated from the Shamaniyya (Buddhists) what resembles these myths: That in the directions of Mount \"Meru\" are four worlds alternated by habitation and ruin. Its ruin is by the dominance of fire over it upon the rising of a sun after a sun until the completion of seven; the water of springs dries up and the blazing fire is enabled to enter it. Its habitation is by its exit from it to another. When the powers of the wind exit in it and carry the clouds and rain on it until it becomes a sea, shells are generated from its foam, to which spirits attach, and humans come from them when the water recedes. Some of them believe that a human from the other world falls into that world and becomes lonely in it from his solitude, and a mate is formed for him from his thought, and offspring begin from them.",

    "text": "XXXIII. On the Types of the Day, Its Daytime and Its Night. The \"Day\" in custom and habit among us, the Indians, and others is the duration between the sun's leaving of a great half-circle (meridian) until its return by the motion of the whole to that very half of it. The Day is divided for eyesight into \"Daytime\", which is the duration of the sun being visible to the people of an assumed dwelling on earth, and into \"Night\", which is the duration of its being absent from them. Visibility and absence are only relative to the horizon. It is known that the horizon of the Equator, which the Indians call \"The Kingdom that has no latitude\", cuts the parallels parallel to the Equator into two halves; therefore, daytime and night are always equal in it. And that the horizons which intersect the parallels without passing through their pole divide the smaller ones into two unequal parts, so the daytime differs for that reason from its night in their dwellings, except at the times of the two Equinoxes. For they encompass all the earth except \"Meru\" and \"Vadavamukha\" in the equality of daytime in it with its night, so that its dwellings then share with the dwellings of the Equator, then differ from them in other times. The beginning of the daytime is the rising of the sun from the horizon, and the beginning of the night is its setting in it. The daytime according to the Indians precedes its night, which is what follows it. For this reason, they called it \"Savana\", meaning a rising day, and also called it \"Manushya Ahoratra\", meaning the day of humans, because their majority know no other. When this day is known, we made it a basis for what is other than it and a standard in estimating others. We said: That which follows the day of humans is \"Pitrya Ahoratra\", meaning the day of the ancient Fathers (Ancestors), due to their belief regarding their spirits that they are in the sphere of the moon. This is a day whose...",

That is that if the light of the moon is in its upper parts towards them, that is daytime for them, and if the light is in its lower parts, it is night for them. It is apparent that their noon is the time of Conjunction (New Moon) and their midnight is the Opposition (Full Moon). Their day then is the entire lunar month. The beginning of the daytime in it is the halving of light in its body increasing, and the beginning of the night is the halving of light in its body decreasing. That is by way of necessity regarding the two halves of daytime and night, and by way of analogy, for the halving of light in the moon is similar to the rising of half the sun's disk from the horizon and the setting of half of it in it. So the daytime of the Fathers then is from the last quarter in the month to the first quarter in the month that follows it, and their night is from the first quarter to the second quarter (last quarter?) in the single month itself, and their sum is their day. Thus the author of \"Vishnu Dharma\" mentioned it in summary, detail, and definition. Then he returned with lack of verification and made the daytime of the Fathers the dark half of the month, which is from Opposition to Conjunction, and the other white half their night. The correct view in the subject is what preceded. Even in their subject is giving charity to the Fathers on the day of Conjunction, and they stated that noon is the time of lunch, and for that reason charity reaches them at the time of their nutrition. Following the day of the Fathers is \"Daiva Ahoratra\", which is the day of the Angels (Gods). It is known that the horizon of the extreme latitudes, which is ninety degrees when the Pole is at the zenith, is the Equator approximately because it is slightly lower than the sensible horizon for the place of Mount \"Meru\" on earth. As for its smallness and what is between it and its foot, it is possible that it is the Equator itself and the sensible horizon is lower than it. It is apparent that the Zodiac belt is halved by its intersection with the Equator, so half of it falls above the horizon and half below it. As long as the sun is in the signs of northern declination, it rotates a mill-like rotation because the daily paths are parallel to the horizon like almucantars. As for the one under the North Pole, its visible part is above the horizon, and therefore it is daytime for him. As for the one under the South Pole, it is hidden below the horizon...",

When the sun moves to the southern signs, it rotates mill-like below the horizon, so it is night for the one under the North Pole and daytime for the one under the South Pole. Under both Poles are the dwellings of \"Daivika\", meaning the spiritual beings, so the day was attributed to them. \"Aryabhata\" of Kashmir said: The \"Devas\" see half the solar year and the \"Danavas\" see its other half, and the \"Pitris\" see half the lunar month and humans see the other half. Thus the cycle of the sun in the sphere of the Zodiac comprised a daytime and a night for each of the Devas and Danavas, and their sum is a day. So our year then is a day of the \"Deva\". Its daytime is not equal to its night because the sun slows down in the northern half of the declination around its apogee, so the daytime is more abundant in magnitude. The difference between the sensible horizon and the true horizon does not compensate for it, for it is imperceptible in the sphere of the sun. Also, the inhabitants of that place according to them are elevated above the face of the earth because they are in Mount \"Meru\". The believer in this opinion believes regarding the height of this mountain what is mentioned in its place. That height necessitates for the horizon an amount of depression by which the increase of daytime over night is doubled. Were it not a religious report and disagreed upon besides, we would have busied ourselves with extracting that amount in which there is no benefit. Among the common Indians are those who heard the mention of daytime for this day in the North and night in the South, along with their use of the two divisions of the year by the two halves of the Zodiac belt: the ascending from the winter solstice attributed to the North, and the descending from the summer solstice attributed to the South. So they made the daytime of this day in the ascending half and its night in the descending half and immortalized it in books. Like the author of \"Vishnu Dharma\", for he said: The half whose beginning is Capricorn is the daytime of the \"Asuras\", who are the \"Danavas\", and the beginning of their night is the sign of Cancer, after saying: The half which is from the beginning of Aries is the daytime of the \"Devas\". He did not notice because nothing occurs at the Poles except the exchange. However, the verification of the one knowing the story, learned in astronomy, is far from this issue.

The magnitude of Brahma's day in our years is 8,640,000,000. Half of it is daytime in which the Ether with what is in it is moving, the earth is inhabited, and the fluctuations of generation and corruption on its face are continuous. Half of it is night in which the matter is contrary to what is in the daytime, and the earth is unchanging due to the stillness of the changers and the suspension of the movers, like the rest of the created being at night and in winter and its gathering prepared for new existence in the daytime and in summer. Each of Brahma's daytime and his night is a \"Kalpa\", which our companions call \"Years of Sindhind\". After this day is \"Purusha Ahoratra\", meaning the day of the Universal Soul, and it is called \"Mahakalpa\", meaning the Greatest Kalpa. As for them, they do not establish it except as an estimation of duration standing in place of time without detailing it into daytime or night. It is imagined from it that its daytime is the duration of the soul's attachment to matter, and its night is the duration of their separation and the rest of the spirits, and that the state necessitating attachment and connection for them returns at the completion of this day. In the book \"Vishnu Dharma\": The life of \"Brahma\" is the daytime of \"Purusha\" and the like of it is his night. They have agreed on the life of \"Brahma\" as one hundred years of his years. The composition of years according to them is from multiples of three hundred and sixty. The magnitude of Brahma's day has preceded; so his year in our years is 3,110,400,000,000, and one hundred years for him in our years is like that with the addition of two zeros so its total is ten zeros (digits?). That is the daytime of \"Purusha\", and his day is double that, which is 6,220,800,000,000,000.

You hardly study them from two books or hear them from two people in one state. Among them is that the day is divided into sixty minutes, each called \"Ghati\". It is mentioned in the book \"Sarodhaya\" by Utpala the Kashmiri: That if a piece of wood is hollowed out cylindrically, the diameter of its round hollow being twelve fingers and its height six fingers, holding three Manas of water; if a hole is pierced in its bottom accommodating six hairs twisted from the hair of a young woman, not an old woman nor a child, the three Manas of water exit from it in the duration of one \"Ghati\". Then every minute of the day is divided into sixty seconds, each called \"Cashaka\" or \"Cakaka\" (Vighati/Pala), and also called \"Vigahatika\". Each of these seconds is divided into six parts, each called \"Prana\", meaning breath. In the mentioned book \"Sarodhaya\" regarding its definition: It is the breath of a sleeper who has slept in a moderate state, neither sick, nor retaining urine, nor hungry, nor full, nor occupied in thought with worry or fear. That is because psychological symptoms from desire or fear and physical ones from emptiness or fullness or a symptom corrupting the praised temperament change the breath of the sleeper.

For \"Brahmagupta\" called the seconds which are Cashaka \"Vinadi\", and \"Aryabhata\" of Kashmir called them likewise, but he also called the minutes of the day \"Vinadi\". Both did not descend below Prana which corresponds to the minutes of the sphere. For \"Paulisa\" says: The minutes of the sphere which are 21600 are similar to the breaths of humans which are average at the times of the two Equinoxes and in the state of health. So a minute of the sphere rotates and a duration of a breath of time passes. Some of them mediated between minutes and seconds an amount they called \"Kshana\", which is a quarter of a minute. They made each one of it fifteen parts, calling each \"Kala\", which is one-sixteenth of the minute which is \"Casha\", except that he named it Kala. At the bottom of this division are three names they did not differ in ordering. The highest is \"Nimesha\", which is the duration of the opening of the eye naturally between two blinks. The middle is \"Lava\". The lowest is \"Truti\", which is the snapping of the index finger from the inside of the thumb when they admire something and approve of it.

Thus it is in \"Sarodhaya\", and to it went \"Sammya\" (?), who is one of their verifying astrologers. He increased in precision claiming that below Truti is another name which is \"Anu\", and every eight of it is one Truti. As for above Nimesha, it is \"Kashta\" and \"Kala\".

    "text": "...they call \"Sankha\" and in Persian \"Spid Muhra\". I saw that in the town of \"Purushavar\" (Peshawar). For them and those in charge of them are times and rations. The day is also divided into thirty Muhurtas, and their matter is confusing. Sometimes it is thought that they are equal in estimation when they relate them to the Ghati and say: Every two Ghatis is a \"Muhurta\", or to the turns and say: Every \"turn\" is three Muhurtas and three quarters. By that, their matter runs the course of equal hours (constant hours). But the number of these hours differs in the daytime of every parallel with declination and its night. Therefore, it is thought of Muhurta that its magnitude in daytime is different from its magnitude at night. Then if they enumerate their lords, the thought is reversed, for they make them fifteen in each of the daytime and night. By that, their matter runs the course of crooked temporal hours (seasonal hours). This is confirmed by an operation of theirs in knowing the Muhurta from the fingers of the person's shadow at the time, if the fingers of the shadow of noon are subtracted from it and the remainder is entered into the middle table which we copied from their poetry. Indeed, the commentator of \"Paulisa Siddhanta\" declares this last opinion and denounces whoever generalizes the statement on the magnitude of \"Muhurta\": That it is two Ghatis, claiming that the number of \"Ghatis\" of the daytime differs in the year while the number of Muhurtas does not differ. Even though he belies himself in explaining the magnitude of Muhurta, that he only made it seven hundred and twenty Pranas because breath is composed of \"Apana\" which is inhaling air and \"Prana\" which is sending it out. They are also called \"Niswasa\" and \"Ucchwasa\". But if one of them is mentioned, it implies the other like nights in the mention of days if mentioned. So it is...",

Therefore, he limited the magnitude of Ghati to one of the two types, making it three hundred and sixty breaths absolutely. When Muhurta is estimated by breaths, it is on the standards of Ghati and equal hours. But he refuses that and disputes his opponents who claim that Muhurta is only fifteen for the daytime if the one counting them is on the Equator or at the times of the two Equinoxes not on the Equator, by (arguing that) \"Abhijit\" falls on noon and the beginning of the other half; if the number of Muhurtas in the daytime were different, their number for the mentioned name for noon would be different. \"Vyasa\" said regarding the birth of \"Yudhishthira\": That it was in the white half (waxing moon), at noon, in the eighth Muhurta. If the opponent thinks from that that it was the day of the Equinox, \"Markandeya\" said regarding it: That it was at the fullness of the full moon of the month \"Jyaishtha\", and this is far from the time of the Equinox. Vyasa also said regarding the birth of \"Basudeva\" (Krishna) that it was in \"Abhijit\" at the passing of the youth of the night and its middle on the eighth of the black half (waning moon) of the month \"Bhadrapada\". That is also far from the time of the Equinox. \"Vasistha\" said: In Abhijit, \"Basudeva\" killed \"Shishupala\", the son of the sister of \"Kamsa\". They claimed in his story that he was born with four hands, and his mother was called from above \"His killer is the one who, if he touches him, his extra hands fall off.\" So they began placing him in the lap of everyone who attended. When Basudeva touched him, his hands fell off as was said. The aunt said to him: You are undoubtedly the killer of my son. Basudeva, while among the boys, said: I will not do that unless he deserves it by a crime he intends, and I will not punish him until he exceeds ten sins. After a time, \"Yudhishthira\" was performing a fire sacrifice, and every notable attended. He consulted \"Vyasa\" on the ranking of the attendees and who the foremost among them deserved of offering water and flowers in a basin to him. He advised putting Basudeva forward. His cousin was present, so he started quarreling and that he was more entitled to honor than Basudeva. He exceeded boasting to...",

Then he took the basin and threw it at him in the manner of their throwing the Chakra weapon, and severed his head. This is the story of the mentioned. The one arguing with what we described is not successful in his argument unless he verifies that Abhijit falls on noon and also falls on the middle of the eighth \"Muhurta\" equally. For if he does not do so, Muhurta has a width in duration, and with the little difference of days and nights in the land of India, it is possible that noon in times far from the Equinoxes is on one side of the eighth \"Muhurta\" and is within it. Evidence of the poor acquisition of the arguer is that he narrated among his arguments from \"Garga\" his saying: That the shadow disappears in \"Abhijit\" of the Equator line, while that does not happen in it except on the two days of the Equinoxes only; indeed, even if it were so always, what does he have in what he is in of that. As for the lords of Muhurtas, they are in this table: The Indians do not use hours except their astrologers in the lords of the hours which is the cause of the lords of the days. The lord of the day is the lord of the night also; they do not separate the daytime from it nor mention the night at all. Then they arrange the lords in the equal hours. The name of the hour is \"Hora\", so this name opens the usage of crooked hours. That is that the halves of the signs which we know as Nim-Bahra, they also call Hora. That was because the ascendants of each of the daytime and night are six signs always. If the hour is marked by the name of half the sign, the hours in each of the daytime and night are twelve. So they are then in the lords of hours crooked as used in our lands and marked on astrolabes for them. This is confirmed by the saying of \"Vijayanandi\" in \"Karanatilaka\", meaning the Blaze of Zijes, when he mentioned knowing the lord of the year and month: As for \"Horapati\", meaning the lord of the hour, make what rose since the morning to the degree of the ascendant minutes all of it and divide it by nine hundred.

It became natural only due to the similarity of its conditions to the conditions of natural things, which are not devoid of a beginning for them as if from non-existence, and of increase and rise in origination and growth, and something like pausing at the peak, then a decline following it towards decay and extinction, and a decrease in origination and growth until it returns to that non-existence. Likewise, the light of the moon in its body is on this path when it appears from the waning crescent (Mahaq) as a crescent, then a moon, then a full moon, and retreats from it likewise to the concealment (Sarar) which is like non-existence relative to sensation. As for the stay in the waning crescent, it is known to all. As for in fullness, it might be confusing to some of the elite, until when the smallness of the moon's body and the greatness of the sun are known, it is known that the illuminated piece of it exceeds the dark one, and that is what necessitates a duration of stay at fullness as a full moon by necessity. Also, from the perspective of its influence on moistures and the apparent affection of them by it so that the matters of increase in tide and ebb and decrease in them revolve with it, that is not hidden from the inhabitants of the coasts and passengers of the sea. Just as its influence on the humors of the sick and the turning of their crises with it is not hidden from physicians. And on the naturalists, the attachment of the affairs of animals and plants to it. And on the experimentalists, its effect on marrows, brains, eggs, and the dregs of wine in its jars and vats, and what it excites in the heads of sleepers in its moonlight, and what it brings to linen clothes placed in its light.

This is the month, and twelve «1» of it is a year by convention called \"Lunar\". As for the \"Natural Year\", it is the duration of the return of the sun in the zodiacal sphere, because it includes «2» the beings of tillage and offspring circulating in the four seasons. By it, the rays of the sun return from the spheres «3» and the shadows of gnomons exactly to their magnitudes, positions, and directions in which or from which they take. This is the year, and it is called \"Solar\" for the sake of the Lunar. Just as the lunar month was half a sixth of its year, likewise the part of twelve of the sun's year is a month for it by convention if the taking is from its mean motion. If it is from its true motion, its month is the duration of its being in a Sign. These are the two famous months and years. The Indians call the Conjunction \"Amavasya\" and the Opposition \"Purnima\" and the two Quartiles \"Atuh\" [?]. Some of them use in the lunar year its lunar months and days. Some of them use the solar months by the heads of the Signs, and the transition in them is called \"Sankranti\". That is by way of approximation, because if it continued with them, they would have used the year of the sun itself and its months, and dispensed by that with intercalating the year with months. Of the users of the moon's months, some of them begin them with the Conjunction, and it is the approved school. Some of them begin them with the Opposition. I heard that \"Varahamihira\" does that, but I have not verified it from his books yet. That is forbidden, and it seems ancient, for in the \"Veda\": Indeed people say the full moon is complete and the month is complete by its completion. That is from their ignorance of me and my interpretation, for the Creator of the world began it from the white half, not the black. It may be permissible that this narrated is from the saying of people. Then «4» the month, from the perspective that the number after Conjunction begins with the name \"Pratipada\" from the lunar days (Tithis), is like its beginning with it after Opposition. Every...",

In them, light and darkness in the body of the moon are equal, and the hours of rising in one of them and setting in the other are equal. They have a calculation for it, which is to multiply the past lunar days of the month if they are less than fifteen, or their excess over fifteen if they are more than it, by the number of \"Ghatis\" of that night, and add two to the product always, and divide the sum by fifteen. So Ghatis and what follows them come out for what is between the beginning of the night and the setting of the moon in the white days or between its rising in the black days. This is because the difference of this duration in nights is by two degrees (minutes?), and the magnitudes of nights hover around thirty degrees (minutes?). If thirty degrees «1» is taken for each day and the product is divided by its half, two degrees come out for each one. Except that he adjusted for the difference of nights, so he multiplied by the magnitude of the night. It would have been more precise to multiply by half the sum of this night and the first of the month. There is no benefit in adding the two degrees, for it is the station of the sighting of the crescent. If the month were taken from it, it would have moved by them to the Conjunction. Because months are composed of days, the types of months are according to the types of their days. Each one of them is thirty «2». As for by the civil days (Savana), which are the standard, the lunar month according to the cycles of the two luminaries in a \"Kalpa\" with them is twenty-nine days and 189,005 of 356,222 of a day. It is what results from dividing the days of a Kalpa by the months of the moon in it. The months of the moon in it are the difference between the cycles of the two luminaries in it, and that is 53,433,300,000. As for the month by the days of the moon (Tithis), it is thirty because this is the number assigned for the month just as the number assigned for the year is three hundred and sixty. The solar month by its days is thirty, and by civil days is thirty days and 1,362,987 of 3,110,400.

Among them is what happens to have a system and a law, and among them is what does not have that. Of that is speech which fell to me, and I have forgotten its source. He said: Indeed thirty «1» -three thousand years of the years of people become a year for the Great Bear (Banat Na'sh), and thirty «2» -six thousand years of the years of people become a year for Brahm, and ninety «3» -nine thousand years of the years of people become a year for the Pole. As for the year of \"Brahm\", \"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva] said to Arjun «4» in the battle between the ranks that the day of Brahm is two Kalpas. In \"Brahma Siddhanta\", a narration from \"Vyasa son of Parashara\" and from the book \"Smriti\": That \"Kalpa\" is a day for Daivika, who is Brahm, and the like of it is a night for him. So then this saying is apparently invalid. The thirty-six thousand years is only the duration of the rotation of the fixed stars in the zodiacal sphere one rotation if their traversing is every degree in a hundred years. The Great Bear is of them, except that they, from the perspective of reports, distinguish it from them and assign to it a distance from the earth different from their distance; therefore it is specialized with states other than their states. If he meant by its year a rotation for it, how fast it is and how false to existence. The Pole does not have a rotation to make a year for it. I only imagine from that that its sayer was very far from the sciences and leading in the group of the foolish (Nuka), and that he attributed these years to those he mentioned by way of magnification.

Then they do not agree in them also on one thing so that we may deal with them in it however they dealt. But they differ in them like their difference in the parts of the day descending from breaths. In the book \"Sravadhava\" by Utpala: That \"Manvantara\" is the lifespan of \"Indra\" the Chief. Twenty-eight Manvantaras is a day for Pitamaha, who is Brahm. His lifespan is a hundred years, which is a day for Keshava. His lifespan is a hundred years, which is a day for Mahadev. His lifespan is a hundred years, which is a day for Ishvara the Near. His lifespan is a hundred years, which is a day for Sadashiva.

However the matter was, it is somewhat orderly due to its foundation on the day and on the hundred years from its beginning to its end. But others build in it on the diminishing parts of the day which we mentioned. So they differ in the composite as they differ in the divided. We mention one of them for those who went to [the view] that a \"Ghati\" is sixteen \"Kala\", and a Kala is thirty «2» \"Kashta «3»\", and a Kashta «3» is thirty «3» \"Nimesha\", and a Nimesha is two «4» of \"Lava\", and a Lava is two «4» of \"Truti\". They claimed that the reason for this division is the composition of the day of \"Shiva\" from what resembles them. That is that the lifespan of Brahm is a Ghati for Hari, who is \"Vasudeva\".

The need for them is religious for the washing of the Brahmins in them, and in the noon between them for food, so that he who has no knowledge of that thought it is a third Sandhi. As for others, they do not exceed the two. In the Puranas, from the story of \"Hiranyakashipu\", the king who was of the genus of \"Daitya\": That he prolonged worship until he deserved answering. He asked for permanence, but was answered to its length because permanence is of the attributes of the Creator, Glory be to Him. When he did not attain it, he asked for his death that it not be at the hands of a human or angel or jinn, and not be on the earth or the sky, and not be in night or day. All of that was a trick to escape from death which is inevitable. He was answered to his request. This is like the asking of Iblis for respite until the Day of Resurrection because it is a day of resurrection from death. Therefore he was not answered except to the day of the known time, about which it was said: That it is the last of the days of obligation. He had a son named \"Prahlada\". He handed him to the teacher when he grew up. He summoned him one day to know what he was in. He recited poetry to him whose meaning was: That there is nothing but \"Bishn\" [Vishnu] only, and what is other than him is false. That was contrary to the desire of the father, for he hated Bishn. So he ordered the changing of his teacher and that he be taught who is the ally and who is the enemy. He stayed for a while then he asked him.

He said: No, but Allah who created you and gave to you protects me. His rage increased and he ordered throwing him into the abyss of the sea. It spat him out and he returned to his place. He threw him before him in a great raging fire, but it did not burn him. He began debating him while in its flames regarding Allah and His power. It ran on his tongue: That Bishn is in every place. His father said: Is he in this pillar of the portico? He said: Yes. The father leaped to it and struck it. \"Narasimha\" came out of it, like the head of a lion on the body of a human, not in the form of a human nor angel or jinn. He and his companions began defending against him, and he repelled because the time was day, until evening came and they got into the \"Sandhi\" of twilight, neither in day nor in night. Then he took him and lifted him to the air and killed him in it, neither on earth nor in sky. He took his son out of the fire and made him king in his place. The astrologers among them need these two times for the strength of some Signs in them as will be reported in its place. So they use them on the apparent matter and make the time of each one of them a \"Muhurta\", meaning two Ghatis, and that is four-fifths of an hour. As for \"Varahamihira\", due to his virtue in the art, he did not know other than day and night and did not allow himself to follow the common opinion regarding Sandhi. He explained it with what is the truth and claimed that it is the time of the being of the center of the sun's body on the reality of the circle of the horizon, and he made it the time of strength of those Signs. After that, the astrologers and others exceeded the two Sandhis of the natural day to others by what is by convention, not nature or sense. They made for each of \"Ayana\", meaning the two halves of the year in which the sun ascends and descends, a Sandhi which is seven days before the arrival of its beginning. Something possible not far-fetched is imagined by me in it, which is that this is innovated, not ancient, and said near the year one thousand three hundred of Alexander (approx 1000 AD) upon their stumbling on the precession of the solstice [relative to] their calculation. For \"Punjala\", the author of the small \"Manasa\" book, says: That in 854 of \"Shaka Kala\" (932 AD) the solstice preceded his calculation by six degrees and fifty minutes, and that will be in the future increasing every year by a minute.

It is the duration at whose two ends the seven planets and their apogees and nodes gather in the beginning of the Sign of Aries. Its days are called \"Kalpa Ahargana\", meaning the total days of Kalpa, for \"Ahar\" is days and \"Gana\" is the total. Because they are civil (rising), they are also called \"Days of the Earth\" because rising is from the horizon and the horizon is of the necessities of the earth. By that name also the past of them to the assumed time is called. Our companions call them \"Days of the Sindhind\" and \"Days of the World\". They are 1,577,916,450,000.

So the day is two thousand 'Chaturyugas'. Similarly, \"Vyasa son of Parasara\" says: That he who believes that one thousand Chaturyugas are a daytime and the like are a night, he is the one who knows Brahma. Within a Kalpa, every seventy-one Chaturyugas is a 'Manu', meaning 'Manvantara', which is the turn of a Manu. And fourteen Manus also constitute a Kalpa. If seventy-one is multiplied by fourteen, the total Chaturyugas for the Manvantaras is nine hundred and ninety-four. The remainder to complete a Kalpa is six of them. However, if they are divided by fifteen, because what borders consecutive things on their two sides is greater than their number by one, the result is two-fifths. So if we start from the beginning of the Manvantaras and place before it two-fifths of a Chaturyuga, and likewise between every two Manvantaras, the fifths will be exhausted following its exhaustion (?), and two-fifths will result at the end of it, just as we placed at its beginning. It is a 'Sandhi' between them, I mean a common interval (Sandhi/Twilight). By it, a Kalpa of one thousand Chaturyugas is completed as was said. The conditions of a Kalpa are consistent, witnessing for each other. For its beginning opens with the vernal equinox, on Sunday, with the conjunction of planets, their apogees, and their nodes, such that there is no 'Revati' nor 'Ashvini', meaning between them, and with the beginning of the month 'Chaitra', and rising over 'Lanka'. Whenever one of these conditions is changed, the others are disturbed and dissolved. We have mentioned the days of a 'Kalpa' and its years. It is known that the days of a 'Chaturyuga', having set a tenth of a tenth of a tenth of a Kalpa (1/1000), are 1,577,916,450, and its years are 4,320,000. So the ratio between a Kalpa and a Chaturyuga is known, and the magnitude of one is known by knowing the other. All of this is according to the opinion of \"Brahmagupta\" and his citations for his position. As for the great \"Aryabhata\" and \"Paulisa\", they composed 'Manvantara' from seventy-two Chaturyugas and composed a Kalpa from fourteen Manvantaras of them, a composition not interspersed with any 'Sandhi'. It is known that the number of Chaturyugas of a Kalpa according to them is 1008, and the years of a Kalpa in 'Deva' years are 12,096,000, and in human years 4,354,560,000.

According to the narration, the days of a Kalpa with him would be 1,590,540,840,000. The opening of a Kalpa and Chaturyuga according to them is from midnight, after the day from whose beginning is their opening according to \"Brahmagupta\". \"Aryabhata\" of \"Kusumapura\" mentioned in a small book of his on excerpts (Tantra?), and he is from the faction of the great Aryabhata, that one thousand and eight 'Chaturyugas' is a day of 'Brahma'. Its first half, which is five hundred and four, is called 'Utsarpini', and the sun in it tends towards elevation. The other half is called 'Apasarpini', and the sun in it tends towards declination. Their limits are named: as for the middle, it is 'Sama', which is equality because it is midday; and its beginning and end are named 'Durtama' (?). This is consistent with the analogy between the Day and 'Kalpa', except for the elevation and declination of the sun. If he meant by it the sun of our day, he must explain their quality for it. And if he meant a sun specific to the day of Brahma, he must show it to us or point to it. It is as if he went in its meaning to the advance of matters and their increase in the first half, and to their retreat and decline in the last half.",

The author of the book \"Vishnu Dharma\" said: That one thousand two hundred years of 'Deva Yuga' years is named 'Tisya' (Kali), and its double is 'Dvapara', and its triple is 'Treta', and its quadruple is 'Krita'. The total is twelve thousand years, and that is a Chaturyuga, meaning the four Yugas, and its meaning is the Totality. He said: Seventy-one Chaturyugas is a 'Manvantara', and fourteen Manvantaras with a 'Sandhi' between every two of them whose duration equals the duration of 'Krita Yuga' constitute a Kalpa. Two Kalpas are a day for Brahma. His life from it is one hundred years, and it is a day of 'Purusha', the First Man for whom no beginning or end is known. He said: This is what 'Varuna', the master of water, informed 'Rama son of Dasaratha' in the first time, as he knew it truly. Likewise, 'Bhargava', who is 'Markandeya', informed of it; he reached such knowledge of times that no one from the numbers (?) opposed him. They had a likeness of the Angel of Death annihilating them with the throne he had, which is 'Apradhrishya' (Invincible?). \"Brahmagupta\" said: The book \"Smriti\" states that four thousand years of 'Daivika' (divine) years is Krita Yuga, and four hundred years with it is Sandhi (twilight) and four hundred 'Sandhyamsa' (portion of twilight). The total is 4800, and it is 'Krita'. Then three thousand years is 'Treta Yuga', and three hundred Sandhi and three hundred Sandhyamsa...",

Then one thousand years is 'Kali', and one hundred years Sandhi and one hundred Sandhyamsa, and the total is 1200, and it is 'Kali Yuga'. This is what he narrated from the book. Converting 'Deva' years to human years is by multiplying them by three hundred and sixty. So the four Yugas in human years: As for Krita Yuga, it is 1,440,000, and each of Sandhi and Sandhyamsa is 144,000, and the total is 1,728,000, and that is 'Krita'. As for 'Treta Yuga', it is 1,080,000, and each of 'Sandhi' and 'Sandhyamsa' is 108,000, and the total of that is 1,296,000, and it is 'Treta'. As for 'Dvapara', it is 720,000, and each of Sandhi and Sandhyamsa is 72,000, and the total is 864,000, and that is Dvapara. As for 'Kali', it is 360,000, and each of Sandhi and Sandhyamsa is 36,000, and the total is 432,000, and that is 'Kali Yuga'. The sum of Krita and Treta is 3,024,000, and with Dvapara 3,888,000. Then \"Brahmagupta\" narrated from \"Aryabhata\" that he considers the four Yugas as quarters of 'Chaturyuga' equally. This contradicts what we narrated from \"Smriti\", and the opponent is an enemy. He said: As for \"Paulisa\", he is praised for what he did since he did not oppose Smriti, because he subtracted from 4800, which is for Krita Yuga, its quarter, and continued subtracting it from what remained, so the Yugas resulted agreeing with Smriti, even if there was no Sandhi and Sandhyamsa in them. Although the Romans (Byzantines/Greeks) are outside the Sunnah (tradition) of Smriti, for they do not measure time by Yuga, 'Manvantara', and 'Kalpa'. This is what he says. It is known that the years of the entire Chaturyuga are not disputed. According to this, the magnitude of every 'Yuga' in it according to Aryabhata in 'Deva' years is 3000, and in human years 1,080,000. The years of two Yugas in Deva years is 6000, and in human years 2,160,000. The years of the three Yugas in Deva years is 9000, and in human years 3,240,000.

He subtracted the same from it (the quarter) because he made it a base for subtraction, so twenty-four remained. He subtracted it also from it, so twelve remained. Then he multiplied each of the remainders by one hundred, so the years of the Yugas in 'Deva' years resulted. If he had made sixty the base because the pivot of most matters is upon it, and made its fifth the base for subtraction, or made the subtraction successive fractions of the fifth decreasing—I mean he subtracted from sixty its fifth, and from what remained its quarter, and from what remained after that its third, then from what remained its half—he would obtain what obtained first. It is possible that this is from him a narration of an opinion among opinions other than the one he holds. For it did not happen that his book in its entirety came out into Arabic because the belief is what appears in practical objectives. \"Paulisa\" deviated from the law he presented when he wanted to make what passed before this Kalpa of ours from the life of 'Brahma' into years of our years. That is by estimating his years as eight years, five months, and four days, which would be by the estimate of 'Kalpa' 6068 (?). So he made them first Chaturyugas by multiplying them by the number of Chaturyugas of a Kalpa according to him, which is 1008, so it totaled 6,116,544. Then he made them Yugas by multiplying them by four, so they became 24,466,176. And he made them years by multiplying them by the years of one 'Yuga' according to him, which is 1,080,000, so it totaled 26,423,470,080,000. These are the years passed from the life of 'Brahma' before our Kalpa. It is possible that it crosses the mind of the companions of \"Brahmagupta\" that he did not make the Chaturyugas into Yugas, but rather made the Chaturyugas into quarters, then multiplied the quarters by the years of one quarter. We do not ask him about the benefit in making them quarters when there is no fraction with them necessitating this homogenization. Multiplying the number of whole Chaturyugas by the years of one whole of them, which is 4,320,000, would have been sufficient instead of lengthening. But we say to him: That is permissible for him to do, were it not that when he wanted...",

And he multiplied the number of complete Chaturyugas passed from the broken Manvantara by the years of one of them, so it totaled 116,640,000. Three of the Yugas have passed from the broken Chaturyuga, and their years according to him are 3,240,000. This number is three-quarters of the years of a Chaturyuga. He used them likewise in considering the position from the week by its days, citing it. If he believed in the previous law, he would have used it in the place of need and taken for the three Yugas nine-tenths of a Chaturyuga. It has become clear that there is no basis for what \"Brahmagupta\" narrated about him and approved. He was only blind to this because of his hatred for \"Aryabhata\" and his excessive attacking of him. He and \"Paulisa\" are on one matter regarding this meaning. Testifying to my saying is his statement: That Aryabhata subtracted from the cycles of the Head (Node) and the apogee of the Moon, so the eclipse calculations were corrupted by the corruption of the cycles. He likened him in his ignorance of that to the woodworm eating the wood, so there forms in what it eats what resembles letters while it does not know them nor intend them. But he who verified them stood against \"Aryabhata\", \"Srishena\", and \"Vishnuchandra\" like the lion against gazelles, so they could not show themselves to him nor show him their faces. With this arrogance, he leaned on Aryabhata and wronged him. We have mentioned the magnitude of \"Chaturyuga\" in civil days according to the three. The increase of \"Paulisa's\" opinion over \"Brahmagupta's\" opinion in days is 1350, but the number of years of Chaturyuga according to both is one. So the days of the solar year according to Paulisa are inevitably more than according to Brahmagupta. According to his narration from Aryabhata, the decrease of his opinion from Paulisa's opinion in days is 300, and the increase of his opinion over Brahmagupta's opinion in them is 1050. So the days of the solar year according to him are more than according to Brahmagupta and less than according to Paulisa.",

The Greeks used to believe regarding the name of the earth—and let the example be one of them—that the calamities that befall it from above and below differ in quality and quantity, and that perhaps what exceeds in one of them or both covers it, so no trick is useful against it, nor escape and caution from it. So it comes upon it. That is like the drowning floods and the destructive earthquakes by swallowing or drowning and burning by what gushes from them of waters or is thrown of heated rocks and ash, then thunderbolts, tremors, and storms, then epidemics, diseases, and death, and the like. When a wide region becomes empty of its nation, then revives after its destruction upon the lifting of that calamity from it, a scattered people gather to it like wild beasts who were fortifying themselves before that in hiding places and mountain tops. They become civilized, helping each other against the adversary whether from predatory beasts or humans, and assisting each other in passing life in safety and joy until they multiply. Then competition fluttering over them with the wings of anger and envy disturbs the goodness of their life.

Then that decreases and its opposites mix with it until the good in the beginning of \"Treta Yuga\" is three times the attacking evil, and the reward is three quarters. The multitude is in \"Kshatriya\" not the Brahmins, and the moon as presented first according to what is in \"Vishnu Dharma\". Analogy would necessitate its decrease according to the decrease of reward. In it, in fire sacrifices, they begin killing animals and plucking plants without having consumed that before it.

In the beginning of \"Tisya\", which is \"Kali Yuga\", evil is three times the remainder of good. Famous news passed for them in \"Treta\" and Dvapara, such as \"Rama\" who killed \"Ravana\", and such as \"Parashurama\" the Brahmin who killed whomever of Kshatriya he overcame since he was avenging his father from them; according to them he is alive in heaven and has come twenty-one times and will return. And such as the war of the children of \"Pandu\" with the children of \"Kuru\". As for in Kali Yuga, evil increases until it churns in its end with the annihilation of good entirely. That is the time of the destruction of the inhabitants of the earth and the return of offspring from the gathering of those scattered in the mountains and hiding in caves for worship, fleeing from the evil human devils. Therefore, that time was called \"Krita Yuga\", meaning the completion of works for departure. In the report of \"Shaunaka\" transmitted by Venus from \"Brahma\": That Allah the Almighty made him hear His saying: If Kali Yuga enters, I will send \"Buddhodana son of Suddhodana\" the Righteous to spread good among creation. The \"Red-Robed\" (Buddhists) attributing themselves to him alter what he brought. The status of Brahmins goes away from that time until \"Sudra\", their servant, dares against them and shares with them and the \"Chandala\" in gifts and presents. People's concerns turn to gathering dirhams (money) and hoarding, not caring about committing sins and crimes in them. That leads them to the disobedience of the younger against their elders, children against their fathers, and servants against their masters and lords. Colors (Castes) mix in chaos until lineages corrupt, the four castes are nullified, and religions and sects multiply. Books composed in them are numerous, by which the masses gathered before him on one matter separate into single individuals. Devalayas (Temples) are demolished and schools are ruined. Justice rises until kings know nothing but injustice, oppression, taking, and breaking, as if they eat people, devouring, deceived by long hopes, not learning from lifespans shortened according to sins and the dominance of epidemics according to the corruption of intention.

What is in the book \"Vishnu Dharma\" is an addition to what we mentioned: That they are ignorant of the quiddity of reward and punishment and deny the knowledge of angels in reality. Their lifespans differ so their measures are hidden from them; some die as fetuses, some as children and youths. The sincere ones are cut off and do not live long, while he who commits sins and disbelieves in religion remains longer. Kings become among the \"Sudra\", so they are like snatching wolves, robbing others of what they see. Brahmins resemble them in action. The multitude is in Sudra and in thieves. The rights of Brahmins are withheld. He who tires himself with asceticism is pointed at with fingers due to his rarity and is mocked. One wonders at whoever serves \"Vishnu\" after they were like that in total. Therefore, the answer is hastened and the reward magnified for little work, and the place and honor are attained by little worship and service. The consequence of the matter at the end of \"Yuga\", when evil reaches its utmost extent, will be the emergence of \"Kalki son of VishnuYashas\" the Brahmin, who is \"Kali\" by whom the Yuga was nicknamed, with a power no one resists and with sharpness with every weapon in which he is unique. He draws his sword against the successors of the successor, purifies the face of the earth from their filth, and empties it of them.

When they became greedy, they strove in gathering, so it became hard on some and easy on some. Thoughts, troubles, and worries entered upon them and called for war, deceptions, and lying.

None of its people knew destructive dispute in deed or word, nor was there among them a blameworthy sect. Rather, they lived a neglected life (simple/carefree). The sea was rejected, not ridden by ships. Cows used to bring provisions.

Then she used to come to the great cities, warn their people, reproach them for bad deeds, and blame them for corrupting the race left by the Golden fathers. She informed them of the coming of a race worse than them and the existence of wars, blood, and great calamities. When she finished, she disappeared from them to the mountains until the Silver ones became extinct and people became of a Bronze race. They extracted the sword, the doer of evil, and tasted the meat of cows, and they were the first to do that. Justice hated their neighborhood and flew to the sphere.

We turned away from recounting them due to their little benefit. In it, \"Maitreya\" the King, and he was a Kshatriya, asked \"Parashara\" the father of \"Vyasa\" about the past and remaining Manvantaras. He mentioned what each \"Manu\" was known by as we placed them in the table. He claimed that the children of every Manu are the ones who own the earth, and he named from their first ones what we established of their names. He claimed that whoever was in the second, third, fourth, and fifth 'Manvantara' was from the children of \"Priyavrata\", and he was an ascetic who drew near much to \"Vishnu\", so he honored his children with this rank.",

    "text": "XLV. On the Mention of the Daughters of Na'sh (Ursa Major/Seven Rishis). The Daughters of Na'sh are called in their language \"Saptarshayah\", meaning the Seven Rishis. They mention that they were ascetics who sought their sustenance from the lawful. With them was a righteous woman, \"Al-Suha\" (Arundhati). They avoided the stalks of lotus from the ponds to feed on them. Religion came and hid her from them. Each one of them was ashamed of the other, so he swore oaths that Religion approved of, and He raised them to the place they are seen in as an honor to them. We had reported that the books of the Indians are composed in poetry, and accordingly they are fond of similes and praises that are novel to them. In \"Samhita\" of Varahamihira is a description of the Daughters of Na'sh before judging by them. That is, according to our translation: The direction of the North is adorned with these stars like the adornment of a beautiful woman with a necklace of strung pearls and a collar of arranged white lotus. Rather, they are in it like dancing maidens rotating around the Pole as he orders them. I say, narrating from \"Garga\" the ancient old man, that the stars of the Daughters of Na'sh were in \"Magha\", the tenth of the Lunar Mansions, when \"Yudhishthira\" ruled the earth. The \"Shakakala\" was after that by two thousand five hundred and twenty-six years. They stay in every Mansion for six hundred years. Their rising is between the East and North. The one adjacent to the East then of them is \"Marichi\", and towards...",

These names might be confused, so we define them by what is known in the constellation of the Great Bear: Marichi is the twenty-seventh of it (Eta Ursae Majoris), Vasistha is the twenty-sixth (Zeta), Angiras is the twenty-fifth (Epsilon), Atri is the eighteenth (Delta), Kratu is the sixteenth (Alpha), Pulaha is the seventeenth (Beta), and Pulastya is the nineteenth (Gamma). These stars take in our time, and the Shakakala in it is 952, from eight and a third degrees of Leo to thirteen and a half degrees of Virgo. According to the motion we find for the fixed stars, they were in the time of Yudhishthira from eight degrees and two-thirds of Gemini to twenty degrees and five-sixths of Cancer. According to the motion the ancients and \"Ptolemy\" worked on, they were then from twenty-six and a half degrees of Gemini to eight degrees and two-thirds of Leo. The mentioned Mansion (Magha) takes from the beginning of Leo to the completion of eight hundred minutes of it. This time (our time) is more worthy for the Daughters of Na'sh to be attributed to \"Magha\" than the time of \"Yudhishthira\". If they went in it to the star Heart of the Lion (Regulus), it was then in the beginning of Cancer. There is no basis at all for what \"Garga\" mentioned; rather, it indicates his lack of guidance to what is needed in associating stars by observation or instruments to the degrees of the signs. I saw in the notebooks of the calendar brought from Kashmir calculated for the year 951 of the \"Shakakala\" that the Daughters of Na'sh have been in the Mansion of \"Anuradha\" for seventy-seven years. This Mansion takes from three and a third degrees of Scorpio to the completion of sixteen degrees and two-thirds of it. The Daughters of Na'sh precede it by close to...",

Let us grant first that Garga is truthful, even if he did not clarify the position from Magha, so we posit it as its beginning, which is the beginning of Leo. From the time of Yudhishthira to our year which is 1340 of Alexander is 3479. We also believe \"Varahamihira\" in the stay of the Daughters of Na'sh in every Mansion for six hundred years. So its position for our year would be in Libra six degrees and seventeen minutes, and that is in the Mansion of \"Svati\", ten degrees and thirty-eight minutes. If we assume what we posited in the middle of \"Magha\", we end up at three degrees and fifty-eight minutes of \"Visakha\". If we assume it at the end of Magha, we end up at ten degrees and thirty-eight minutes of Visakha. What is mentioned in the Kashmiri calendar does not agree with what is in \"Samhita\". Likewise, if we made the position what is in the calendar and went back from it with this motion to the past, we would not end up at Magha at all. We used to consider the speed of the fixed stars in our time great and their slowness in the past and seek reasons for it in the configuration of the sphere. Their motion according to us is a degree in every sixty-six solar years. So the matter of \"Varahamihira\" became more amazing because it implies their motion is a degree in forty-five years, and his time precedes our time by close to five hundred and twenty-five years. In the Zij \"Karanasara\" for the motion of the Daughters of Na'sh and knowing its position, its author ordered to subtract 821 from \"Shakakala\". The Origin remains, which is what exceeds the completion of four thousand years from the beginning of \"Kali Yuga\". Then the Origin is multiplied by 47 and 68000 is added to the sum. The sum is divided by ten thousand. Signs and what follows them come out, and that is the position of the Daughters of Na'sh. As for the addition, it is necessarily the position of the Daughters of Na'sh for the beginning of the Origin multiplied by ten thousand. If the addition is divided by it, six signs and twenty-four degrees come out. It is known that we divided the ten thousand by the forty-seven, the duration of the motion of one sign came out as two hundred and twelve years and nine...",

What a difference between \"Varahamihira\" and \"Vatesvara\" if there is no error in the transmission. If we follow this operation for our year, it comes out in \"Anuradha\" nine degrees and seventeen minutes. The people of \"Kashmir\" used to believe regarding the motion of the Daughters of Na'sh that it is one hundred years for the Mansion. It was in the mentioned calendar that the remainder for it to complete the hundred is twenty-three years. All of this is due to lack of exercise in the conditions of astronomy and mixing it with religious reports. Their authors among them believe regarding the Daughters of Na'sh that they are higher than the positions of the fixed stars. They claim that in every \"Manvantara\", a \"Manu\" is renewed, so his children own the earth, and the presidency is renewed for Indra, as well as the groups of angels and the Daughters of Na'sh. As for the need for angels, it is for people to make sacrifices for them and deliver their shares to the fire. As for the need for the Daughters of Na'sh, it is to renew the \"Veda\", for it perishes at the end of every Manvantara.

Rather, it is repelling corruption and evil with what is possible. Reform, according to it, precedes corruption. If it is not consistent and not possible, then with the corruption that is inevitable.

When he approached completion or almost finished ninety-nine of them, the Spirituals feared for their position and knew that what they have from people would be cut off if they dispensed with them. They gathered to \"Narayan\" calling him for help. He answered their request and descended to the earth in the form of \"Vamana\" [Dwarf], which is the human whose hands and legs fall short of the magnitude of his body so his appearance becomes ugly because of that. He came to \"Bali\" the King while he was in the act of sacrifice, and the Brahmins were with him around the fires, and Venus his vizier was before him. The treasuries had been opened and jewels poured «1» in heaps for gifts, grants, and charities. Vamana began, like the Brahmins, reciting the \"Veda\" from the place called now \"Sama Veda\" with a sad «2» enchanting melody that shook the King to generosity towards him regarding what he wanted and proposed. Venus whispered to him that this is Narayan who has come to steal your kingdom, but he did not heed his saying due to the intensity of his joy. He asked him what he wanted. He said: An amount of four steps from your kingdom to live in. He said: Choose what you want and how you want. He asked for water to pour on his hand to execute by that what he ordered, and it is a custom for them. Venus entered the jug due to his intense love for the King and blocked its spout so it would not let out «3» water, blocking the hole of the spout with the grass of the ring finger's ring. He (Vamana) poked the eye of Venus and removed him, so the water flowed. Vamana stepped one step to the East and another to the West and a third upwards reaching \"Svarloka\". No place remained of the world for the fourth, so he enslaved him by it and placed his foot between his shoulders as a mark of enslavement and sank him into the earth until he sank to \"Patala\", the lowest of the low. He took the worlds from him and handed the leadership to \"Purandara\" [Indra]. In \"Vishnu Purana\": That \"Maitreya\" the King asked \"Parashara\" about the Yugas.

The farmer selects his crop, leaving in it what he needs and uprooting other than it. The keeper leaves of the branches what he knows nobility in and prunes what is other than it. Indeed, the bee kills from its kind the one who eats and does not work in its hive. Nature does likewise, but it does not distinguish because its action is one. So it destroys the leaves and fruit of the tree and prevents it from the action prepared for it, so it removes it. Likewise the world, if it is corrupted by multitude or almost is, and it has a Manager and His care totally in every part of it exists, He sends to it one who reduces the multitude and cuts off the materials of evil. Of that, according to what the Indians claim, is \"Basdiv\". For he arrived in the last time in the form of a human named Basdiv when the tyrants multiplied in the earth and it was filled with injustice until it was swaying from the multitude and trembling from the intensity of the tread. Basdiv was born in the town of \"Mathura\" to the sister of \"Kamsa\" its ruler then.

The brothers of Basdiv and his tribe were scoundrels, jesters. One of them hid under his clothes an iron frying pan and asked the ascetic about his pregnancy, mocking him. He said: In your belly is what is the cause of your destruction and the destruction of all your family. \"Basdiv\" heard that and grieved for it due to his knowledge of the truth of his saying. He ordered that that frying pan be filed with a file and thrown into the water. That was done. A remnant remained which the one in charge of that deemed insignificant and threw as it was. A fish swallowed it and was caught; the fisherman found it in its belly and fashioned it for his arrow as a point. When the destined time came, Basdiv was on the coast sleeping under the shade of a tree, one of his legs over the other. The hunter thought him a gazelle and shot him, hitting his right foot. The wound was the cause of his death. Arjun's left twitched, then his upper arm. His brother \"Sahadeva\" advised him not to enable him (Basdiv) to embrace him lest he take away his strength. He came to him, and due to what was in him, he did not «1» enable him to embrace him. He asked for his bow and handed it to him, so he tested his strength with it. He advised him regarding his body and the bodies of his tribe for burning, and regarding his women to carry them from the fort, and he died. As for the filings, they grew reeds (sedge). \"Yadava\" came to it and tied bundles from it for sitting and drank. A brawl occurred between them; they fought in it with the bundles of reeds and killed each other. All that was near the mouth of the river \"Sarasvati\" in the sea at the place of \"Somnath\". Arjun did «2» all that he was ordered. He carried his women, but thieves intercepted them. Arjun was not able to string his bow, so he realized the departure of his strength. He began circling the bow above his head; what was under it survived, and what went out of it the thieves captured.

The Indians, even if they did not find the multitude of number heavy but rather rejoiced in it, they are compelled in usage to reduce it. Among their eras is the beginning of the being of \"Brahm\". Among them is the beginning of the day of his day now, which is the beginning of \"Kalpa\". Among them is the beginning of the seventh \"Manvantara\" which we are in. Among them is the beginning of the twenty-eighth \"Chaturyuga\" which is the one we are in. Among them is the beginning of the fourth Yuga of it, called \"Kalikala\", meaning the time of \"Kali\", for the Yuga is known by it even if its time is in its end, but they mean by it the beginning of \"Kali Yuga\". Among them is \"Pandava Kala\", which is the time of the wars of \"Bharata\" and its days. All these eras are ancient; their years have exceeded hundreds to thousands and beyond. Astrologers, let alone others, found them heavy. We, to define them, make the first example the Indian year most of which falls in the year four hundred of Yazdegerd (400 Y.E. / 1031 AD). For its hundreds are stripped of units and tens, so it was specialized by that and distinguished from other years. Then it became famous by the collapse of the most impregnable pillars and the passing of the like of Sultan Mahmud, Lion of the World and Rarity of Time, Allah's mercy upon him, less than a year before it. As for the Indian year, its Nowruz (New Year) precedes by twelve days and follows the mentioned obituary by ten complete Persian months. If what we assumed is known, we drive the years to this Conjunction which is the opener of the Indian year, for it completes at it, and the mentioned Nowruz is close to it and follows it.

He said: And whoever encompasses the detail of that and conceives it with true conception is a Knower ('Arif). The Knower is the one who serves the One Lord and seeks the neighborhood of His place called \"Brahma Pura\" (Padam?). If what he mentioned is known—and we have indicated the magnitudes of these things with a sufficient indication from which it becomes clear that the past of the life of \"Brahm\" to the time we assumed for the example in our years is 26,215,732,948,132 «2». And from his day which is the \"Kalpa\" of the Day 1,972,948,132. And from the seventh Manvantara 120,532,132. It is also the date of the imprisonment of King \"Bali\" because it was in the first \"Chaturyuga\" of the seventh Manvantara. Everything we mentioned and mention in dates is their complete years, as there is no custom for them to use the broken year in them. In the book \"Vishnu Dharma\": \"Markandeya\" said in answer to \"Vajra\": Six Kalpas have passed over me, and from the seventh six Manvantaras, and from the seventh twenty-three \"Treta Yugas\". In the twenty-fourth \"Rama\" killed \"Ravana\", and it was said \"Lakshmana\" brother «3» of Rama [killed] \"Kumbhakarna\" brother «3» of Ravana, and they conquered all \"Rakshasas\". At that time \"Valmiki\" «4» the Rishi made the story of \"Rama and Ramayana\" and immortalized it in books. And I narrated it to \"Yudhishthira son of Pandu\" in the grove of \"Kamyakavana\". As for his counting \"Treta Yuga\", it is because the mentioned conditions were in it. Also, counting by one is better than one that expresses four. The end of Treta Yuga is more worthy of those conditions than its beginning due to its proximity to evil. There is no doubt that the date of \"Rama and Ramayana\" is known to them, but it did not fall to us. The years of twenty-three Chaturyugas are 99,360,000.

And from the twenty-eighth \"Chaturyuga\" 3,892,132. All of this is on the estimations of \"Brahmagupta\". He and \"Paulisa\" agree that the \"Kalpas\" of the life of \"Brahm\" before our Kalpa are 6,068. The dispersal «1» is only in their Chaturyugas. For with Paulisa they are 6,116,544, and with Brahmagupta with a decrease of 48,544. If we work according to the school of Paulisa that a Manvantara is 72 Chaturyugas without \"Sandhi\" and a Kalpa is 1008 Chaturyugas and every \"Yuga\" is a quarter of it, the past of the life of Brahm to the time of our example would be 26,425,456,200,000. And from Kalpa 1,986,124,132. And from Manvantara 119,884,132. And from Chaturyuga 3,244,132. As for what is after \"Kali Yuga\", there is no disagreement in its complete years. So it is according to both of them from Kali Yuga 4,132, which is \"Kalikala\". And from the wars of \"Bharata\", which is \"Pandava Kala\", 3,479. They have an era called \"Kala Yavana\". I did not verify it, except that they claimed it was in the end of the Lower \"Dvapara\". The mentioned Yavana was dominant over their land, corrupting their religion. All these eras are large in number, distant in beginning. Therefore, they turned away from them and came to the eras of \"Sri Harsha\", \"Vikramaditya\", \"Shaka\", \"Vallabha\", and \"Gupta\". As for Sri Harsha, they believe regarding him that he used to contemplate the earth and see what is in its belly to the seventh [earth] of hoarded treasures and stored burials, extract them, and dispense by them from burdening his subjects. His era is used in Mathura and the regions of \"Kannauj\". From him to Vikramaditya is four hundred years according to what some people of that region mentioned. I saw it in the Kashmiri Almanac later than Vikramaditya by 664. So I obtained doubt and certainty has not cleared it yet. The users of the era of Vikramaditya in the southern and western countries in the land of India place 342 and multiply it by three always, so 1026 gathers. Then they add to it the past of \"Shadabda\" (Samvatsara?), which is the Sexagenary Cycle, so that is the era of Vikramaditya. I found his name in the book \"Sravadhava\"...",

If they had placed in the beginning of the matter 1026 as they placed 342 without a necessitating cause, it would have been sufficient. Suppose it was consistent in one \"Samvatsara\", what is the way in it if it doubled? As for the era of Shaka, which is \"Shakakala\", it is later than Vikramaditya by 135. The mentioned Shaka was dominant over what is between the river Sindh and the sea of their land. He had made his residence \"Aryavarta\" in the middle. He prohibited them from attributing to other than the Shaka era. Some of them claimed that he was a Shudra from the city of Al-Mansura. Some of them claimed that he was not Indian but came to them from the direction of the West. They were in severe affliction from him until succor came to them from the regions of the East by \"Vikramaditya\" intending him, until he defeated him and killed him in the region of \"Karur\" which is between \"Multan\" and the fort of \"Loni\". The time became famous according to the joy at his killing and was dated by, especially by the astrologers among them. They attached \"Sri\" to the name of Vikramaditya out of reverence for him. Due to the extension of the period between «1» the date we attributed to him and the killing of \"Shaka\", I think he is not the killer but his namesake. As for the era of \"Vallabha\", who is the owner of the city of \"Vallabhi\" which is south of the city of \"Anhilvara\" by close to thirty \"Yojanas\", its beginning is later than the era of Shaka by two hundred «2» and forty-one years. Its users place \"Shakakala\" and subtract from it the sum of the cube of six and the square of five, so the era of Vallabha remains. Its news will come in its place. As for \"Gupta Kala\", they were, as was said, a wicked powerful people. When they became extinct, they were dated by. It is as if Vallabha was the last of them, for the beginning of their era is also later than Shakakala by 241. The era of the Astrologers is later than Shakakala by 587. Upon it is built the Zij \"Khandakhadyaka\" by Brahmagupta, which is known among us as Al-Arkand. So then the years of the era of \"Sri Harsha\" for our year represented «3» by it is 1488. And the era of Vikramaditya 1088. And Shakakala 953. And the era of Vallabha which is also Gupta Kala 712. And the date of the Zij Khandakhadyaka 366. And the date of \"Pancha Siddhantika\"...",

These eras attributed to the Zijes are the ones their authors deemed suitable for driving calculation from. It is possible they were in their times, just as it is possible they precede them. The commoners of India count years hundred by hundred and call it \"Samvatsara\" of the Hundred. Whenever a hundred expires, they leave it and start counting a hundred after it. They called it \"Laukika Kala\", meaning the Era of the Public. They differed in reports about that, a difference with which verification of it disappeared from me. To the extent of their difference in it, they differed in the principle of the year and its opening. I present of it what I heard specifically until the matter in it reveals a law. I say that he who uses the era of \"Shaka\", and they are the Astrologers, opens the year with the month of \"Chaitra\". It was said that the people of \"Kanir\" [Kanauj? / Kunar?] bordering Kashmir open it from the month of \"Bhadrapada\", and their date for our year is 84. And that those living between \"Bardari\" and \"Marigala\" open it from the month of \"Kartika\", and their date for our year is 110. He claimed in the Kashmiri that it is six of the New Hundred, which is the school of the people of \"Kashmir\". And that those living in \"Nirahar\" behind Marigala to the last borders of \"Takishar\" and \"Lohawar\" open it from \"Margashirsha\", and their date for our year is 108. The people of \"Lanbaga\", meaning \"Lamghan\", follow them in that. I heard the people of \"Multan\" say that this was the opinion of Sindh and the people of \"Kannauj\", and that they used to open the year from the conjunction of Margashirsha, and that the people of Multan left that since a few years and moved to the opinion of the people of Kashmir and agreed with them on opening it with the conjunction of Chaitra. I have presented the excuse in this chapter, and that its dates are not verified because of what is in them of the addition to the hundred. Although I witnessed them in the year of the uprooting of \"Somnath\", which is four hundred and sixteen of the Hijra, and \"Shakakala\" in it is 947. If they intended it, they placed 242 and under it 606 99. Then they sum them, so it is Shakakala. It was imagined by me that 242 is the years of the delay of their beginning with the Hundred, and that they began in that from \"Gupta Kala\". And that 606 is the Samvatsaras of the complete Hundred, and it necessitates that each one be 101. As for 99, they are the past years of the incomplete. It is so, and a leaf I found from a Zij made by \"Durlabha\" the Multani verifies it. He says in it: Place 848 and add to it \"Laukika Kala\", meaning the era...",

They had kings in Kabul, Turks, said in their origin that they were from Tibet. The first of them came, \"Barhatakin\", and entered a cave in Kabul which cannot be entered except lying down crawling «1», and in it is water. He placed food there for days. This cave is now known there called \"Baqar\" [?]. He who seeks blessing by it enters it and exits with some of that water with effort. At its door were groups of farmers working. The likes of these things are not possible nor circulate «2» except by collusion with someone. The one who colluded with him made the people persist in work night and day by shifts so the place would not be empty of people. Upon the passing of days since his entry, one exits from the cave while people are gathered, and they see him as born from the mother, wearing the dress of the Turks of tunic, cap, boots, and weapon. So he was honored with the honor of a being invented and for the kingdom created. He took over those places styling himself the Shah of \"Kabul\". The kingdom remained in his children for generations numbering around sixty. Were it not that the Indians are negligent in the matter of order and heedless of the system of the dates of kings in succession and resorting to guessing at confusion and necessity, we would have presented what a group of them mentioned. Although I heard that that lineage is on brocade found in the fort of \"Nagarkot\". I was eager to examine it, but the matter was prevented for reasons. Among their whole was \"Kanak\" [Kanishka], and he is the one to whom the Vihara in Peshawar is attributed, so it is said \"Kanak Chaitya\". They claimed that the \"Rai of Kannauj\" gifted him among what he gifted a fine wondrous robe. He wanted to cut clothes for himself, but the tailor refrained from working on it and said: Here is the image of a human foot, and however I strive, it does not come except between the shoulders.

The vizier said: You have stirred a still one and done what is not obligatory. So cut off my nose and lips now and mutilate me so I may find a way to plot, for there is no face for open confrontation. The Rai did to him what he said and left him and went to the far ends of the kingdom. When the army stumbled upon the vizier and knew him, they brought him to Kanak. He asked him about his condition. The vizier said: I was forbidding him from opposition and calling him to obedience and advising him. He accused me and mutilated me. He passed on his face to a place to which taking the main road is long, and it is easy from the side of traversing a desert between us and him if carrying water for such-and-such days is possible. \"Kanak\" said: This is easy. He carried water as he said and asked him to guide the direction. He preceded him and entered him into a wilderness with no limit to its ends. When the days expired and the road did not end, he asked the vizier about the condition. He said: There is no blame on me in protecting my master and destroying his enemy. The nearest exit from this desert is what you entered from. So do with me what you want, for there is no escape for anyone from it. Kanak rode and galloped his horse around a low place. Then he planted his spear in its center, and water gushed forth, a gushing that sufficed the army for drink and provision! The vizier said: I did not intend by the trick the capable angels, but I intended by it the incapable humans. Since the matter is so, accept my intercession for my benefactor and forgive him. Kanak said: I am returning from this place to the back. I have answered your request. What was obligatory has been executed in your master. He departed. The vizier went to his master \"Rai\" and found him having lost his hands and legs on the day Kanak planted the spear in the earth. The last of them was \"Lagaturman\" and his vizier from the Brahmins was \"Kallar\". Time helped him, so he found by chance buried treasures by which he became strong and powerful. According to that, the state turned away from his master due to the antiquity of its era with the people of his house «1».

    "text": "50 - On the Cycles of the Planets in each of \"Kalpa\" and \"Chaturyuga\"\nIndeed, among the conditions of Kalpa is that the wandering planets be gathered in it at the beginning of the Sign of Aries, meaning the point of the Vernal Equinox, with their apogees and nodes. So there are for each one of them in the days of Kalpa complete cycles inevitably. In the Zij of Al-Fazari and Ya'qub bin Tariq, those cycles are benefited from the Indian man who was in the group of the delegation of Sindh to Al-Mansur in the year one hundred and fifty-four of the Hijra (771 AD). If we compare between them and what the Indians are upon, we find differences between them whose cause I do not know. Is it from the transmission of the two men? Or is it from the dictation of the Indian? Or is it from the correction of \"Brahmagupta\" or another of them? Inevitably, he who is vigilant, what he sees in the planets of the disorder of calculation concerns him, so he strives to correct it, like Muhammad bin Ishaq al-Sarakhsi. For he found a lagging in the calculation of Saturn and continued considering until he became certain that it was not from the side of the equation. Then he began adding a cycle to its cycles and inducing until the calculation from them agreed with his witnessing. So he established them thus in his Zij. Brahmagupta narrated from \"Aryabhata\" regarding the cycles of the apogee of the Moon and its node a difference we mention as he narrated, since we did not study that except imitating him. In this table is all of that to be encompassed if Allah the Exalted wills. These cycles are by mean motions. Because \"Chaturyuga\" is a tenth of a tenth of a tenth (1/1000) of \"Kalpa\" according to \"Brahmagupta\", if we take from each one of these cycles a part of a thousand parts of it, it is the movement in Chaturyuga. Just as if we take instead of this part a part...",

They did not understand it correctly and thought that Aryabhata is the name of the part. The Indians pronounce this 'D' (in Aryabhata) between it and 'R', so it transferred to 'R' and became \"Aryabhar\". Then it was misread after them and the first 'R' became 'Z' (Arjabhar -> Arjazhar/Uzjahar?). If it were returned to the Indians, they would not know it. Abu al-Hasan al-Ahwazi presented the motions of the planets in the years of 'Arjabhar', meaning in a \"Chaturyuga\". I establish them in tables as he mentioned, for I guess in them that they are the dictation of that Indian. Perhaps they are according to the opinion of \"Aryabhata\".

    "text": "LI. On Establishing the Matter of \"Adhimasa\", \"Unaratra\", and the \"Aharganas\" of Different Days. Because the months of the Indians are lunar in solar years, necessarily the beginning of their year advances in its position from the solar year in every year by the difference between the two lunar and solar years. When one month is completed from that advancement, they do with it what the Jews do in making the leap year thirteen months by repeating \"Adar\", and like the action of the Arabs in the Jahiliyya with the year of Nasi' (intercalation) by delaying the beginning of the year so that the one preceding it becomes thirteen months. The Indians call the year in which a month is repeated, in common usage, \"Malamasa\". \"Mala\" is the wick of dirt on the palm (when rubbed), for it is thrown away just as this month is thrown from the calculation so the number of months of the years remains twelve-fold. In books, it is called \"Adhimasa\". The one repeated of the months is the one in which the calculation of the month is completed. If it is completed in its beginning before its entry and before anything of it passes, that month is repeated and not another, for even if it has not entered it, the completion is also not in the month before it. If the month is repeated, the first of them is named by its name, and \"Dwi\" (Double/Second?) is attached to the second from its beginning to distinguish between it and the first. As if, for example, the month of \"Ashadha\" is repeated, so the name of the first of them is Ashadha and the second \"Dwi Ashadha\". The first is the discarded one, which is considered ominous and in which nothing is performed of what is performed in the other months. Its most unlucky time is the day of the completion of its calculation. The author of the book \"Vishnu Dharma\" said: That the decrease of \"Chandra\" (Lunar) from \"Savana\" (Civil), meaning the decrease of the lunar magnitude from the rising (civil) one, is six days...",

And that the increase of \"Saura\" (Solar) over Chandra is eleven days, so from it gathers in two years and seven months the intercalary month \"Adhimasa\". All of this month is inauspicious; nothing should be done in it. This is speech in gross terms. Its verification is that the year of the moon in its days is three hundred and sixty, and the year of the sun in them is three hundred and seventy-one days and thirty-one parts out of four hundred and eighty parts of a day (likely referring to tithis/lunar days). According to the difference between them, thirty days for Adhimasa gather in 976 and 4156 out of 47799 lunar days. That is thirty-two months, meaning two years, eight months, and sixteen days, then the fraction we mentioned, which is approximately five minutes and thirteen seconds. As for the religious command necessitating that, what was read to us from \"Veda\" has this meaning: If the day of Conjunction (Amavasya), which is the first of the lunar days of the month, passes devoid of the sun's transition (Sankranti) from one sign to another, then there is a transition in the day following it, the month before it is dropped from the calculation. This is not correct, and the matter was from the reader/translator. That is because the month in lunar days is thirty days, and half of a sixth of the solar year in these days is thirty days and 5311 out of 5760. That in minutes of days is 55 19 22 30 (55 days?). If we assume for example the Conjunction in the beginning of a sign, and we start adding these fractions to the time of that Conjunction time after time, the times of the sun's transitions in the signs after it appear. Because the difference between the months of the two luminaries is a fraction less than a day, it is impossible for a day in the month to be devoid of a transition; rather, perhaps two consecutive transitions gather in a single day of it. That is when the earlier of them happens in the day in less than 4 40 37 30 (?), for the next one happens necessarily in the like of that mentioned fraction which does not suffice to complete a day. So then the narration from \"Veda\" is incorrect. What I guess is correct is thus: If a month passes and the sun does not have a transition in it from one sign to another, then that month is dropped from the calculation. That is because if the transition happens from the twenty-ninth day in not less than 4 40 37 30, the transition precedes the month after it, so it is devoid of transition...",

It is known with that the reason for taking this annulled month as ominous, because it is stripped of the time designated for earning reward. As for \"Adhimasa\", if the derivation of the name is from the first month because \"Adi\" is the beginning, this name appears in the books of Yaqub bin Tariq and Al-Fazari as \"Padamasa\", and \"Pada\" is the end, so it is possible the Indians name it with both, although the two men are prone to misreading and their narration is not relied upon. I only mentioned this because \"Paulisa\" declared regarding the latter of the two namesake months that it is the intercalary one. As for the month from Conjunction to its like, it is a return of the moon obtained distancing from the sun following the signs to it, and it is the difference between their motions because they are towards one direction. The returns of the sun in a \"Kalpa\", I mean its cycles, if subtracted from the returns of the moon in it, the lunar months in a Kalpa remain inevitably. Whatever is in every Kalpa, let us call it Universal for ease, and what is in part of it, Partial. The months of solar years are twelve solar. The months of the moon likewise, either in its own year it exhausts them. As for in the sun's year, due to the excess between the two years, the months of the year in \"Adhimasa\" become thirteen. It is known that the difference between the Universal months of the two luminaries are those extra months by which the year becomes thirteen months. So they are then the Universal Adhimasa months. As for the Universal Solar months, they are 51,840,000,000. As for the Universal Lunar months, they are 53,433,300,000. The difference between them, which is Adhimasa months, is 1,593,300,000.

But they are not the desired, because it is their Civil (rising) days, and they are less than the Lunar in number because the unit of one is greater than the unit of the Lunar. So a number needs to be subtracted from them to obtain the desired. This decrease is the one called \"Unaratra\". What pertains to the Partial Lunar Days from it is according to the ratio of the decrease of Universal Civil Days from Universal Lunar Days to Universal Lunar Days. Universal Lunar Days are 1,602,999,000,000, and their excess over Universal Civil Days is 25,082,550,000, which is the Universal Decrease.

Yaqub ibn Tariq erred in deriving Solar Days and claimed that obtaining them is by subtracting the cycles of the Sun in a \"Kalpa\" from its Civil Days, I mean the Universal. It is not so. Rather, he multiplies its cycles by twelve to become months, then thirty to become days, or multiplies the cycles by three hundred and sixty. He stuck to correctness in Lunar Days, multiplying its months by thirty, then returned to error in deriving Decrease Days, claiming they are obtained by subtracting Solar Days from Lunar Days.

We give an example of this operation for the beginning of the Indian year and \"Shakakala\" 953, which is what we made an example for our operations. We take from the beginning of the life of \"Brahma\" according to the laws of \"Brahmagupta\". We have said that what passed of it before our Kalpa is 6068 Kalpas. The days of a Kalpa are known, so the total of its days is 9,574,797,018,600,000. If weeks are cast away, five remain.

If we multiply them by the Decrease days for Chaturyuga and divide the amount by the Lunar Days in it, Decrease days come out as 18,835,700, and 598,055 out of 2,226,389 remains. By it, the Civil Days from the beginning of Chaturyuga become 1,184,947,570, which is the required. We now transfer from \"Paulisa Siddhanta\" his work in the like of what we worked to increase the clarity of meaning and firmness in the heart. Paulisa said: We place what passed before the Kalpa of the life of \"Brahma\", which is 6068 Kalpas. We multiply them by the number of Chaturyugas of a Kalpa, which is 1008, so 6,116,544 gathers.

We multiply them by twelve, so 317,081,640,960,000 months gather. We place them in two places. We multiply one of them by the number of \"Adhimasa\" months in \"Chaturyuga\", which is 1,593,336, or the number we presented standing in its place, and divide the amount by the Solar months in Chaturyuga, which is 51,840,000. Adhimasa months come out as 9,745,709,750,784. We add them to the other place, so 326,827,350,710,784 gathers. We multiply it by thirty, so it becomes 9,804,820,521,323,520, which are Lunar days. We place them in two places. We multiply one of them by the Decrease of Chaturyuga, which is the difference between its Civil and Lunar days, and divide the amount by its Lunar days. 153,416,869,240,320 comes out, and that is Decrease days.

If those days are cast away as weeks, nothing remains of them. So they ended on Saturday, and this Kalpa began on Sunday. It is known that the implication of this is that the beginning of Brahma's life is Sunday also.

Twenty-seven Chaturyugas have passed from it; their days by the like of the previous operation are 42,603,780,600. Their completion is on Monday, and the opening of the twenty-eighth is on Tuesday. Three Yugas have passed from it; the total of their years is 3,240,000. So by the like of what preceded, their days are 1,183,438,350, ending on Thursday, and \"Kali Yuga\" began on Friday. The days of what passed of \"Kalpa\" are 725,447,708,550, and the days of what passed of the life of \"Brahma\" to the beginning of Kali Yuga which we are in are 9,651,219,099,791,750. According to the narration from \"Aryabhata\" without seeing a book of his, if the days of \"Chaturyuga\" according to him are 1,577,917,500, what passed of Kalpa to the beginning of Kali Yuga was 725,447,570,625, and to the day of our example 725,449,079,845, and the days past of the life of Brahma before our Kalpa 9,651,401,817,120,000. This is the straight path in analyzing years, and to it is measured all else that comes for understanding. We have pointed to the error of Yaqub in taking the Universal Solar and Decrease days. Since he was transmitting from the tongue of the Indian a calculation whose reasons he did not understand, at least he should have tested it and induced its conditions. He mentioned in his book the operation of \"Ahargana\" also, I mean the analysis of years, but he erred in his saying: Multiply the months of the given years by what passed of \"Adhimasa\" months to the time you want according to what is indicated in Adhimasa.

The error in this is something a copyist discovers in writing, so how about the calculator who calculates it if he multiplied by the Partial Adhimasa instead of the Universal. In his book is another good operation for analysis, which is that if the months of the years are obtained, they are multiplied by Lunar months and the amount divided by Solar months. Adhimasa months come out added to the months of the years. If they are multiplied by thirty and added to what passed of the days of the broken month, Lunar Days gather. If the multiplication of the first months by thirty is advanced and what passed of the month is added to it so the Partial Solar Days gather, then what preceded is done with them, Adhimasa days come out added to Solar Days. The reason for this is that if we multiply as preceded by the Universal Adhimasa months and divide by Universal Solar months, the share of what we multiplied of Adhimasa comes out. It is known that Lunar months are the sum of Solar months with Adhimasa months. If we multiply by them while the division remains as is, the output is also the sum of the multiplicand with the required, and that is Lunar Days. It has preceded that if they are multiplied by Universal Decrease days and the amount divided by Universal Lunar Days, its share of Decrease days comes out. But Civil Days in \"Kalpa\" are less than Lunar by Decrease days. So the ratio of what we have of Lunar Days to it (Civil), with its share of Decrease subtracted from it, is like the ratio of all Lunar Days to it, with all Decrease subtracted from it; and that is Universal Civil Days. So if we multiply what we have by Universal Civil Days and divide the sum by Universal Lunar Days, the days of the given date come out as Civil, which is the required. 3,506,481 stands for all Civil Days in multiplication, and 3,562,220 stands for all Lunar Days in division. The Indians have another operation in this chapter: They multiply what passed of \"Kalpa\" years by twelve and add to the amount what passed of the year of complete months. They place the amount over 69120. What comes out they subtract from the middle. They divide double the remainder of it by 65. Partial \"Adhimasa\" months come out. They add them to the upper. Then they multiply the total by thirty and add to it what passed of the month. Partial Solar Days gather. They place them...",

Partial Decrease days come out. They subtract it from the upper place, so the required Civil Days remain. The reason for this operation is that if Solar months are divided by Universal Adhimasa months, the magnitude of one Adhimasa comes out from it as 32 months and a fraction of a month which is 8544 out of 15933. Double that is 65 months 1155 out of 15933. If double the months of the given years is divided by it, Partial Adhimasas come out. However, if the division is by integers with fractions and one wants to cast a piece from the dividend such that the division of what remains of it is by integers only with equality of matter in both, the ratio of the whole divisor to its fraction which follows it is like the ratio of the dividend to that piece. If we homogenized the divisor in our example, it would be 1,036,800 and the fraction 1155, and after them the fifteen, so the first becomes 69,120 and the second 77. It was possible to work this on the single \"Adhimasa\" without doubling it so as not to need doubling the remainder. It seems he preferred this to reduce the two numbers because the fraction in the single one is 8544 and the homogenized total is 518,400; they agree in 96, so the first multiplied becomes 89 and the second divisor 5400. His subtlety in that and the reason for his work has become clear until he obtained Partial Lunar Days and made the multiplicand smaller. As for his work in extracting Decrease days, Universal Lunar Days if divided by Universal Decrease days, sixty-three days come out and a remainder remains which is reduced by the factor 450,000. So the fraction becomes 50,663 from a denominator of 55,739. That is of Lunar Days in which one day of Decrease days is completed. If the denominator of the fraction is made eleven, its fraction becomes nine and 55,642 out of 55,739 of one-eleventh of a day, which in minutes is 59 54. Due to its closeness to becoming whole, they were lenient and made it ten out of eleven. The day according to them is completed from Decrease days in sixty-three lunar days and ten parts of eleven of a day, which after homogenization is 703 out of eleven. If Lunar Days return in reality from multiplying Decrease days corresponding to them by sixty-three...",

Therefore, if it is desired to divide Lunar Days by 703 so that the output of the division equals the first, a piece must be added to it, which is what he extracted by way of approximation, not verification. For if we multiply Universal Decrease days by 703, 17,633,032,650,000 gathers, which is more than Universal Lunar Days. Multiplied by eleven is 17,632,989,000,000. The difference between them is 43,650,000. If the product of Universal Lunar Days by eleven is divided by it, 403,963 comes out. This is the number he used. If no remainder remained from it, the work would be verified. But 405 out of 4365 remains from it, and that is 9 out of 97, which is the amount of leniency. If he took it without a fraction and divided by it the product of Partial Lunar Days by eleven, that necessary increase from the side of the increase of the dividend part came out. The rest of the operation is apparent. Because the majority of Indians need \"Adhimasa\" in the matter of their years, they detail this operation and take the description of the one for knowing it without knowing Decrease days and without the sum of days, for it does not concern them. Among their methods in that from \"Kalpa\" years or other \"Chaturyuga\" and \"Kali Yuga\" years is that they place the years in three places. They multiply the upper by ten, the middle by 2481, and the lower by 7739 (text says 77139 then 7739 in ex). They divide each of the middle and lower by 9600. Days come out from the middle and \"Avama\" (Decrease) from the lower. They sum what comes out of them and add it to the upper. The completed past Adhimasa days gather, and the sum of what remained from the other two places is the fraction of the broken one. If the days are divided by thirty, they become months.

From the lower came out 1,590,483,915 and 9548 remained. The sum of the two remainders is 17,840; one (unit of divisor) rises from them. So the total of integers in the three places becomes 21,829,849,018, which are \"Adhimasa\" days. The remainder of the broken day is 103 out of 120 (after simplification?). If we raise these days to months, 727,661,633 of them are completed, and 28 days remain. It is called \"Shuddhi\". It is what is between the first of the non-discarded \"Chaitra\" and the Vernal Equinox. Also, if what came out of the middle is added to the years, they become 2,482,831,914. If weeks are cast away, three remains. So the Sun's entry into Aries in this year is on Tuesday. As for the two numbers assumed for multiplication in the middle and lower place: If Civil Kalpa days are divided by the Sun's cycles in it, the share of the year comes out from it; its excess over three hundred and sixty is five days followed by 1,116,450,000 out of 4,320,000,000. They are reduced by the factor 450,000, becoming 2481 out of 9600. Although these two also reduce by three, it was intended by leaving them at this amount that they and what follows them be of one genus. If Universal Decrease days are divided by Solar years in \"Kalpa\", the share of the year comes out as five days followed by 3,482,550,000 out of 4,320,000,000.

One of the two ends, which is the year of the moon, is the used one, and the other end, which is the year of the sun, is the sought one. So the sum of the two quotients is what is between the two years. In the sum of the whole days is the multiplication of the upper, and in each of the two fractions is the multiplication of the middle and the lower. When we wanted brevity and did not want what they wanted of extracting the mean motions of the two luminaries, we added the two numbers of the multiplication for the middle and lower positions, so it was 10,220. We added to it for the upper position the product of the part divided by in ten, and that is 96,000. So 106,220 gathers, related to 9,600. They fold by half, so the related becomes 5,311 and to it 480. It has become clear from what preceded that if we multiplied the days by 5,311 and divided the sum by 172,800, the days of Adhimasas come out. If we multiplied the number of years instead of days, the total would be a part of three hundred «2» and sixty of what would gather by days. If we wanted what came out first to come out of the division, it would be necessary to divide by a part of three hundred and sixty of what we divided by, and that is 480.

So the months of \"Adhimasa\" come out, and what remains is the past of the broken ones. If it is multiplied by thirty and what results is divided by 32, its days and what follows them come out. The cause of that is that the months of the sun in \"Chaturyuga\" «3», if divided by the months of Adhimasa in it according to him, 32 comes out and 35,552 of 66,389 remains. If the months are divided by it, the complete months of Adhimasa in the past of Chaturyuga «3» or \"Kalpa\" come out.

Paulisa has done this work of his with the solar days resulting from the date (era) instead of months. He said: These days are placed in two places. One of them is multiplied by 271 and the sum is divided by 4,050,000. What comes out is subtracted from the other, then the remainder is divided by 974. So the months of Adhimasa and what followed them of days and their fractions come out. Then he said: That is because the days of Chaturyuga «1» if divided by the months of Adhimasa, 976 comes out, which are days, and 104,064 remains. The agreement (common factor) between it and the divisor is 384. If we divide them by it, they become 271 and 2,050,000 (Correct is 4,050,000 as in text previously). I suspect the copy or the translator in it, for \"Paulisa\" is too majestic to overlook «2» the like of it. That is because the days divided by the months of \"Adhimasa\" are the solar ones by necessity. What comes out of their integers is correct, and the remainder is as he mentioned. The fraction folds with its denominator by an agreement of twenty-four, so the numerator becomes 4,336 and the denominator 66,389. If we comply with what preceded regarding months and genericize the magnitude of Adhimasa, it becomes 47,800,000 «3». The agreement between it and its fraction is 16. By it, the multiplied becomes 271 and the divisor 2,800,000 (Text has 2800000 but calculation suggests 4050000?). As for the number which he placed for division, if we multiplied it by the agreement he mentioned, which is 384, 1,555,200,000 gathers, which are the days of the sun in \"Chaturyuga\" «4». It is impossible that it be a divisor in this part of the work. This work, if built on the principles of \"Brahmagupta\" and the total months of the sun are divided by the months of Adhimasa, what preceded in the method in which he used double Adhimasa results. Then it is possible that the like of this method be done for the days of Decrease (Una Ratra) by placing the partial days of the moon in two places, and multiplying one of them by 50,663 and dividing the sum by 3,562,220, and casting away what comes out from the other place, then dividing...",

There is no benefit in what increases length, especially with the need for \"Avama\", which is the remainder of the partial Decrease, because the two remainders from the two divisions are attributed to two different denominators. Whoever encompasses what preceded in analysis is guided to synthesis if the past of the days of \"Kalpa\" or \"Chaturyuga\" «1» is assumed known to him. But we repeat its mention for caution and say that if the sought is the years and the given is the days, they are by necessity civil (rising), and they are the difference between the lunar ones and their decrease. The ratio of this difference to its decrease is like the ratio of the difference between the total lunar days and the total days of decrease, and that is 1,577,916,450,000, to the total days of decrease. 3,506,481 substitutes for that. So if the given is multiplied by 55,739 and what is reached is divided by 3,506,481, the days of partial Decrease come out. If they are added to the civil ones, they turn into lunar, which are the sum of the partial solar ones with the partial days of \"Adhimasa\". The ratio of these solar ones to the days of Adhimasa which are in them is like the ratio of the sum of the total days of the sun and days of Adhimasa, and that is 160,299,900,000, to the total days of Adhimasa. 178,111 substitutes for that. So if what resulted of the partial days of the moon is multiplied by 5,311 and the sum divided by 178,111, the partial days of Adhimasa come out. If they are subtracted from these lunar days, the solar ones remain. They are then raised to months by division by thirty, and the months to years by division by twelve. That is the sought. For example, the partial civil days for the time we gave as an example were 720,635,951,963. So as if we were given them and asked how many Indian years and months they are. We multiplied them by 55,739 and divided what gathered by 3,506,481. The days of Decrease came out 11,455,224,575. We added them to the civil ones, so the lunar days gathered 732,091,176,538.

We raised them by twelve, so 1,972,948,132 rose, which are the Indian years returned as they were first in the example. For that also is a method Ya'qub mentioned, which is to multiply the given civil days by the total days of the moon and divide the sum by the total civil days. What comes out is placed in two places. One of them is multiplied by the total months of Adhimasa and what gathers is divided by the total days of the moon. So the months of Adhimasa come out. Their product in thirty is subtracted from the other place, so the partial solar days are obtained in it. They are raised to months and years. That is because we said before that the given days are the difference between their lunar ones and their decrease, just as the total civil days are the difference between their total lunar ones and total decrease. So they are proportional. Therefore, the partial lunar days which we place in two places come out. Since they are equal to the sum of their solar ones and their days of Adhimasa, just as the total days of the moon are equal to the sum of the total days of the sun and days of Adhimasa, the partial and total Adhimasa are on their ratio whether they are together months or days. As for what Ya'qub mentioned of extracting the days of partial Decrease from the months of partial Adhimasa, which is in all copies: by multiplying what passed of Adhimasas and parts of the broken ones by the days of total Decrease and dividing the sum by the total months of the sun; what comes out he adds to Adhimasa, and that is the number of what passed of Decrease. I think it is stripped of knowledge and not confirmed by induction and experiment. For the months of \"Adhimasa\" in the past of \"Chaturyuga\" «1» according to the opinion of \"Paulisa\" to the time of our example are 1,196,525 and 1,337 of 1,500. If we multiplied them by the decrease of Chaturyuga «1», gathered...",

We present first what is in the Zij \"Khandakhadyaka\" because this Zij is more famous and their astrologers «1» prefer it more. \"Brahmagupta\" said: Place \"Shakakala\" and subtract from it 587. Multiply the remainder by twelve and add to it what passed of the year of complete months. Multiply the sum by thirty and add to it what passed of the month of days. So partial solar days gather; place them in three places. Add to each of the middle and lower ones five. Divide the lowest of them by 14,945. What comes out, subtract it from the middle and discard what remains in the division. Then divide the middle by 976.

Subtract the days of Decrease from the upper, so the civil days remain, and they are \"Ahargana Khandakhadyaka\". If you cast them by sevens, the position of your day in the week remains. An example of that for the time of the mentioned example is that \"Shakakala\" for it is 953. We subtracted from it 587, so 366 remained. We multiplied it by the product of the twelve «1» in thirty because it is devoid of months and days, so it became 131,760, which are solar days. We placed them in three places. We added to the two lower ones five, so each became 131,765. We divided the lower by 14,945, so 8 came out. We subtracted it from the middle, so 131,757 remained. We discarded what remained of the division. Then we divided the middle by 976, so 134 came out, which are months, and 973 of 976 remained. We multiplied the months by thirty, so 4,020 gathered.

Cast from it 587, so the years of \"Al-Shakh\" remain. Easier than that: Take the complete years of Yazdegerd and cast from them 33 always, so the years of Al-Shakh remain. Or take the origin of the years of Al-Arkand, the ninety, multiply it by six and add to it fourteen, then add to it the years of Yazdegerd and cast from it 587, so the years of Al-Shakh remain. I do not think this Shakh is anything but \"Shaka\". However, what results from the date is not its date, but rather the date of \"Gupta Kala\" which is analyzed into days. If he were to place this ninety multiplied by six with eight added to it, which is 548, unchanging with the increase of years, the matter would be the same and far from affectation. Safar which he pointed to corresponds first to the eighth day of \"Dai Mah\" year 103 of Yazdegerd. For this reason, he suspended the matter of \"Chaitra\" on the crescent occurring in Dai Mah. But the months of the Persians have advanced since then due to neglecting «1» the quarter day in them. The subject necessitates the advance of the date of the kingdom of Sindh which he mentioned over the date of \"Yazdegerd\" by seven years. So its years for the time of our example would be 405. With the years of Al-Arkand which is its origin, meaning 548, it is 953, which is \"Shakakala\". With the subtraction he ordered from it, it becomes \"Gupta Kala\". What remains of the work in analysis is according to what we narrated from \"Khandakhadyaka\". Perhaps division by a thousand instead of division by 976 is found in some of its copies; that is an error in copying, not that it is a method. We follow this with the work of \"Vijayananda\" in his Zij known as Karana Tilaka, which is this: Place Shakakala and subtract from it 888. Multiply the remainder by twelve and add to what gathered what passed of the year of complete months. Place the sum in two places. Multiply one of them by 900 and add to what gathered 661. Then divide the sum by 29,282. So the months of \"Adhimasa\" come out. Add them to the other place and multiply what reached by thirty and add to the sum what passed of the days of the month.

As for the divisor, it is the sevenths of the duration of one Adhimasa, and he has taken it as thirty-two «2» months and seventeen days and eight \"Ghatis\" and thirty-four \"Chashaka\" approximately.

What is between the first of the mentioned Sha'ban to it of months is 2,695. With the placed months, 3,559. We placed them in two places. We multiplied one of them by 7 and divided it by 228. The months of \"Adhimasa\" came out 109. We added them to the other place, so it became 3,668. We multiplied it by thirty, so 110,040 gathered. We placed it in two places.

Then we subtracted what came out from the upper, so 108,318 remained in it, which are the civil days. The correction of this work is to know that from the origin of the date which was placed to the first of Sha'ban which was dated from is 25,958 days, and they are 876 Arabic months, meaning seventy-three «1» years and two months.

This work has preceded universally. When the man assumed it for a time, he added additions in it and the rest remained as it was. As for what is in \"Karana Sara\", the turning of its author from analysis to another method prevented presenting what is in it, and the corruption of translation in what resulted from it. What can be narrated is that he subtracted from \"Shakakala\" 821, so the origin remained, which is for our example 132. He placed it in three places. He multiplied the first by 132 degrees, so 17,464 «1» gathered for our example. He multiplied the second by 46 minutes, so 6,072 gathered. As for the third, he multiplied it by 34, so it became 4,488. He divided it by 50, so minutes and what he wanted to follow them came out, and that is 89 46. Then he added to the degrees gathered in the upper 112 «2» and raised what rose of the sums to what is above them and the degrees to cycles. So after forty-eight cycles, 328 40 46 was obtained. That is the mean moon for the time of the sun entering Aries. He divided the degrees of the mean moon by twelve, so days came out. He multiplied the remainder by sixty and added to it the minutes of the mean moon. He divided the total by twelve, so \"Ghati\" came out. On this analogy what follows it. What came out for us was 27 23 29. That is the days of \"Adhimasa\". There is no doubt that it is the past of the Adhimasa which we are in. regarding the generation of its magnitude, he divided the numbers of the moon which we mentioned, which is Kalpa revolutions, by twelve. So the share of the year came out 11 3 52 50, and the share of the month from it 0 55 19 24 10. He extracted the duration of the gathering of thirty days from this share, so it was two years «3» and eight months and sixteen days and four \"Ghatis\" and forty-five «4» \"Chashakas\".",

As for the Sun and Moon, they were in the middle of their course at the beginning of Aries, and there was no separation for Adhimasa nor for the days of Decrease. As for in the Zijes which we mentioned, \"Ahargana\", meaning the days of the date, is multiplied for every planet by an assumed number, and you divide it by another assumed one. So the complete cycles and what followed them of the mean come out. Perhaps it is completed from them; and perhaps its completion is by returning to the days of the date and dividing them either as they are or after multiplication by a number by another number, and appending what comes out to the first. Perhaps numbers are assumed like the origin to be added or subtracted so the mean at the beginning of the date is driven from the beginning of the wholes. This is the method of \"Khandakhadyaka\" and \"Karana Tilaka\". As for in \"Karana Sara\", he extracts the means for the Vernal Equinox and Ahargana is from his side. Because those are partial methods not stopping from multiplication, narrating them lengthens without benefit. Then what is after that of the Equation and the rest of the works does not have connection with what we are in.",

    "text": "55 - On the Order of the Planets, their Distances and Sizes\nA narration from \"Vishnu Purana\" and from the commentary of \"Patanjal\" preceded in the mention of the Lokas necessitating the lowness of the Sun below the Moon in the order of the spheres. That is their religious opinion. Especially, it was said in \"Matsya Purana\": That the distance of the heaven from the earth is by the magnitude of half the diameter of the earth. The Sun is lower than all. The Moon is above it. The Mansions and their stars are above the Moon. Above them is Mercury, then Venus, then Mars, then Jupiter, then Saturn, then the Great Bear, then the Pole above it. The Pole is connected to the heaven. It is impossible that the stars fall under the counting of a human. Whoever defended this opinion claimed that the Moon is hidden by conjunction from the Sun as the lamp is hidden in its light, then appears by distancing from it. We mention now some of what is in the books of this opinion of the descriptions of the two luminaries and the planets, then we follow it with the astronomical opinion, even if only a little of it fell to us. It was said in \"Vayu Purana\": That the Sun is spherical in shape, fiery in nature, having a thousand rays by which it takes water. Four hundred of them are for rain, three hundred for snow, and three hundred for the air. It was said in another place of it: That some of them are for the coexistence of \"Dev\" in happiness, and some for the coexistence of people in amenities, and some for the Fathers. He also divided it in another place over the sixths of the year. He said: It illuminates the earth in the third which is from the beginning of Pisces with three hundred rays, and rains in the third following it with four hundred rays, and cools and snows in the remaining third with three hundred. In it also: That the ray of the Sun and the wind lift water from the sea to the Sun. If it dripped from...",

In it also: That the heat of the Sun and its light are a quarter of the heat of the fire and its light. It falls into the water at night in the North, therefore it reddens. In it also: That there was in ancient times earth, water, wind, and heaven. \"Brahm\" saw a spark under the earth, so he extracted it and made it into thirds. A third of it is the familiar fire needing wood, extinguished by water. A third is the Sun and a third is Lightning. In the animal also is fire, and this is not extinguished by water. For the Sun attracts water, and Lightning flashes through rain, and that which is in the animal is among moistures and feeds on them. It is as if they went in this to the nutrition of the celestial bodies by vapors as Aristotle narrated that from a group. That is because the author of \"Vishnu Dharma\" declared that the Sun feeds the Moon and the stars. If there were no Sun, there would be no star, no angel, and no human. Their belief regarding the bodies of all stars is that they are spherical in shape, watery in substance, not luminous; and the Sun among them is fiery in substance, luminous by essence, illuminating others accidentally if it faces them. In the totality of stars by vision is what is not stars in reality, but rather lights of rewarded people whose seats are in the high heaven on chairs of crystal. It was said in Vishnu Dharma: That the stars are watery and the ray of the Sun illuminates them at night. Whoever obtains by his good work a place in the high sits in it on his throne. If he shines, he is counted among the stars. He named all of them \"Tara\", which is a name derived from \"Tarana\", which is the crossing (Passage). The meaning: As for these, it is as if they crossed the evil of the world and settled in bliss. As for the stars, because they cross the heaven by rotation. The name \"Nakshatra\" is restricted to the stars of the Mansions. Because all of them are characterized as fixed stars, the name Nakshatra applies to all of them also, for its meaning is that it does not increase nor decrease. As for me, I think that this increase and decrease applies to number and the distances between them, but the author of the book diverted it to light. He said: As the moon increases and decreases. Then he said, and the speech belongs to Markandeya: The stars which do not perish before the completion of \"Kalpa\" are in the rank of \"Nikharva\", meaning 100,000,000,000. Those falling before the completion of Kalpa are of unknown number; hardly anyone knows it...",

He said: If they were fixed in their state not changing to their duration, I would not be ignorant of them. But He continues to ascend one of the virtuous and bring down another; therefore I do not record them. As for the diameters of the two luminaries and the Shadow, it was said in \"Matsya Purana\": That the diameter of the body of the Sun is nine thousand «1» \"Yojanas\" and the diameter of the Moon is double that, and the Head (Rahu/Node) is like their sum. Likewise it is in \"Vayu Purana\", except that it was said regarding the Head: That if it is with the Sun it is like it, and if it is with the Moon it is like it. Another said regarding the Head: That it is fifty thousand \"Yojanas\". As for the diameters of the wandering planets, it was said in \"Matsya Purana\": That the circumference of Venus is a part of sixteen parts of the circumference of the Moon. The circumference of Jupiter is three quarters of the circumference of Venus. The circumference of each of Saturn and Mars is three quarters of the circumference of Jupiter. The circumference of Mercury is three quarters of the circumference of Mars. Likewise it is in \"Vayu Purana\". As for the fixed stars, in both of them is that the circumference of the great fixed stars is equal to the circumference of Mercury. That which is smaller than that is five hundred Yojanas. Then they decrease by a hundred until they reach two hundred; there is not among them smaller than a hundred and fifty. This is what is in Vayu Purana. As for in Matsya Purana, it was said: Then they decrease by a hundred until they reach the hundred, and there is not among them less than half a Yojana. I suspect this from the side of the copy. The author of \"Vishnu Dharma\" said, narrating from \"Markandeya\": That \"Abhijit\", Vega, and \"Ardra\", Sirius, and \"Rohini\", Aldebaran, and \"Punarvasu\", the heads of Gemini, and \"Pushya\", and \"Revati\", and \"Agastya\" «2», which is Canopus, and the Great Bear, and the owner of \"Vayu\" (Svati?), and the owner of \"Ahirbudhnya\" (Uttara Bhadrapada?), and the owner of \"Vasishtha\" (Mizar?): each one is five Yojanas. The rest are each one four Yojanas. I do not know what is not counted after them; they are from below four Yojanas to two Krohs, meaning two miles. What falls short of two Krohs people do not see; rather \"Dev\" sees it. I found...",

This is what we found of their confusions in this chapter. Let us turn away from them to the opinions of the astrologers among them. There is no disagreement between us and them in the order of the planets, that the Sun is their middle, Saturn and the Moon their ends, and the fixed stars their highest. A part of it has passed during the preceding narrations. \"Varahamihira\" said in the book \"Samhita\" «1»: The Moon is always below the Sun. It «2» casts its ray upon it and illuminates half its body, and the other half remains dark possessing a shadow, like the jar if you set it up to the eye of the sun, until it illuminates its half facing the sun and the half which does not face it remains dark. The Moon is watery in origin; therefore it reflects the ray falling on it as water and the mirror reflect it to the wall. If the Moon is with the Sun, the whiteness is from it to it, and the blackness to us. Then the whiteness descends towards us little by little according to the distance of the Moon from the Sun. Everyone who has an outcome from the owners of their reports, let alone the astrologers, sees that the Moon is below the Sun, indeed below all planets. What fell to us of their reports about the distances of the planets is what Ya'qub bin Tariq mentioned in his book on \"The Composition of the Spheres\": He benefited them from the Indian in the year one hundred and sixty-one of the Hijra (777/778 AD). He codified a principle in it which is: That the finger (digit) is six barleycorns arranged in width, the cubit twenty-four fingers, and the Farsakh sixteen thousand cubits. But the Indians do not know the Farsakh; this magnitude as we presented is half a \"Yojana\". Then he mentioned: That the Farsakhs of the diameter of the earth are 2,100 and its circumference 6,596 «3» and 9 of 25. Upon it he calculated the distances as we established in the table. What he mentioned of the magnitude of the earth is not agreed upon by the Indians, for its diameter according to \"Paulisa\" in Yojanas is 1,600 and its circumference...",

    "text": "This is an opinion contrary to what \"Ptolemy\" based the matter of distances on in \"The Book of Hypotheses\" (Planetary Hypotheses), and the ancients and moderns followed him in it. For their principle in them is that the furthest distance (apogee) of every planet is the nearest distance (perigee) of the one above it, and there is no place between their two spheres idle from action. In this opinion (of the Indians), there would be between the two spheres a place empty of them containing a holder like an axis upon which rotation occurs. It is as if they believed in the Ether some heaviness so that a holder was needed for the inner sphere to hold it in the middle of the outer one. Among what is known among the people of the art (astronomers) is that there is no way to distinguish the higher of two planets from the lower except by way of Occultation or by way of the increase of Parallax. As for Occultation, it happens rarely. As for Parallax, it is imperceptible in other than the Moon. However, the Indians went in that to the equality of motions and difference of distances. So the cause of the slowness of the higher became the wideness of its sphere and the speed of the lower the narrowness of its sphere. Thus, a minute in the sphere of Saturn is two hundred and sixty-two times a minute in the sphere of the Moon. Therefore, the time of traversing them differed despite the equality of the two motions. Then I did not see any speech in this chapter except what comes amidst the books mentioning corrupt numbers in them, like the answer of \"Paulisa\" to one who objects to him for making the circumference of the sphere of every planet twenty-one thousand and six hundred and its radius three thousand four hundred and thirty-eight, while \"Varahamihira\" says regarding the distance of the sun that it is 2,598,900 and regarding the distance of the fixed stars that it is 321,362,683. That the first is in minutes and the latter in Yojanas, along with his saying that the distance of the fixed stars is sixty times the distance of the sun. It should have been that the distance of the fixed stars is 155,934,000. As for the method we pointed to from their side, it is built on a principle unknown to me according to what I knew until Allah facilitates the translation of their books. That principle is that the area of a minute in the sphere of the Moon is fifteen Yojanas.",

That is because he said: The time of the moon's passing over the horizon, I mean from the shining of the beginning of its body to the rising of all of it, or from the beginning of its setting to the completion of its disappearance, was observed and found to be in thirty-two minutes of the rotation of the sphere (daily rotation), although observing degrees is difficult let alone minutes. So the \"Yojana\" of the diameter of its body was observed and found to be 480. It was divided by the minutes of its body, and the share of a minute came out as fifteen Yojanas. That was multiplied by the minutes of the circle (360 degrees x 60), and 324,000 gathered. This is the area (circumference) of the sphere of the Moon in Yojanas which it traverses in every cycle. If it is multiplied by its cycles in a \"Kalpa\" or \"Chaturyuga\", what it traverses of it in it gathers. That according to \"Brahmagupta\" in the duration of a Kalpa is 18,712,069,200,000,000. He calls it \"Yojanas of the sphere of the Zodiac\". It is known that if they are divided by the cycles of every planet in a Kalpa, the Yojanas of one cycle come out. But the motion of the planets according to them, as we said, is one in distance. So the output is the area (circumference) of the sphere of that planet. And because the ratio of the diameter to the circumference according to him is approximately the ratio of 12,959 to 40,980, if the area (circumference) of the planet's sphere is multiplied by 12,959 and the amount divided by 81,960 (should be 40980?), the radius comes out, which is its distance from the center of the earth.

He calls it \"Yojanas of the Heaven\". It is what the Moon traverses in every \"Chaturyuga\". The ratio of the diameter according to him to the circumference is the ratio of 1250 to 3927. So when the circumference of the sphere of every planet is multiplied by 625 and the amount divided by 3927 (using radius ratio?), the distance of the planet from the center of the earth comes out. We have done with them the like of what preceded and established what resulted according to his opinion in a table also. As for the radii, we dropped the fractions falling short of half in them and rounded up those exceeding it. We did not do the like of that in the circumferences, but we verified them because they are needed in the motions. That is that the Yojanas of the Heaven in a \"Kalpa\" or Chaturyuga if divided by its Civil Days, 11,858 comes out, and for Brahmagupta 25,498 out of 35,419 remains, and for Paulisa 209,554 out of 292,207. This is what the Moon traverses every day, but the motion is one; so it is then what every planet travels every day. Its ratio to the Yojanas of the circumference of its sphere is like the ratio of its required motion to the Circle (360 degrees), assuming it is three hundred and sixty. So then, when the common motion for all planets is multiplied by three hundred and sixty and the sum is divided by the Yojanas of the circumference of the intended planet, its mean \"Bhukti\" comes out, which is its mean for a day: [Table]",

Its Yojanas according to \"Brahmagupta\" were 6522 and according to \"Paulisa\" 6480. When Paulisa obtained the minutes of the Moon's body as 32, which is an even number (power of 2), he divided it for the planets by halving down to one. He made half of it for Venus, a quarter for Jupiter, an eighth for Mercury, half an eighth for Saturn, and a quarter of an eighth for Mars. It is as if he admired the order, otherwise the diameter of Venus is not half the diameter of the Moon in vision, nor Mars a quarter of its eighth. As for the calculation of the two bodies of the luminaries at every time according to their distance from the earth, which is the Modified Diameter obtained in the two operations of their rectification (equation): Let AB be the diameter of the Sun's body, GD the diameter of the Earth, and GDH the shadow cone, with its axis HL. We extend GR parallel to DB, so AR is the difference between AB and GD. And the perpendicular GT is the mean distance of the Sun, I mean the radius of its sphere extracted from the Yojanas of the Heaven. The Modified Diameter of the Sun differs constantly, increasing over it and decreasing from it. Let it be GK, and it is inevitably in parts of the Sine. Its ratio to GT, assuming it is the Total Sine, is like the ratio of Yojanas GK to Yojanas GT. By this it is converted to them. The Yojanas of AB to Yojanas KG is like the ratio of minutes AB to minutes KG, assuming it is the Total Sine. So AB in minutes of the sphere is known because the Total Sine is taken according to the magnitude of the Circle. Therefore Paulisa said: Multiply the Yojanas of the radius of the sphere of the Sun or Moon by its Modified Diameter and divide the sum by the Total Sine. Divide by what comes out for the Sun 22,278,240 and for the Moon 1,650,240. The minutes of the diameter of the body worked for come out. These two numbers are the product of the \"Yojanas\" of the diameters of the two luminaries by 3438, which are the minutes of the Total Sine. Likewise \"Brahmagupta\" said: Multiply the Yojanas of the Luminary by 3416, which are the minutes of the Total Sine, and divide what results by the Yojanas of the radius of its sphere. This division is incorrect because the magnitude of the body does not change by it. Therefore \"Balabhadra\" the commentator saw, as \"Paulisa\" saw, that the division should be by the Converted Modified Diameter. For knowing the diameter of the Shadow, called in our Zijes \"The Magnitude of the Sphere of the Node\" (Jawzahar), Brahmagupta said: Subtract the Yojanas of the diameter of...",

Then multiply the diameter of the Earth by the Modified Diameter of the Sun obtained upon its rectification, and divide what results by the Preserved. The Rectified Diameter comes out. As for the similarity of triangles ARG and GDH, it is apparent. Except that the perpendicular GT does not change from its magnitude, and the Modified Diameter is what changes the vision of AB while it remains constant in its magnitude. Let this diameter be GK. Extend AYR and parallel YKW parallel to AB; it is equal to the Preserved. Extend YGM, so M is the head of the shadow cone at that time. The ratio of YW, the Preserved, to KG the Modified Diameter is like the ratio of GD the diameter of the Earth to ML, which he called a Rectified Diameter, and it would be in minutes of the Sine, because KG... For this reason, I suspect what follows it of omission of something from the manuscript, for he said: Then multiply it by the diameter of the Earth; the distance between the center of the Earth to the tip of the Shadow gathers. Subtract from it the Modified Diameter of the Moon and multiply the remainder by the diameter of the Earth, and divide what gathered by the Rectified Diameter. The diameter of the Shadow in the sphere of the Moon comes out. Assume the Modified Diameter of the Moon LS and FN from the sphere of the Moon whose radius is LS. Since LM came out in minutes of the Sine, its ratio to GD assuming it is double the Total Sine is like the ratio of MS in minutes of the Sine to AS in minutes of the Sine. But I think he intended converting LM the Rectified Diameter to the magnitude of \"Yojanas\". That would be by multiplying it by the Yojanas of the Earth's diameter and dividing the sum by double the Total Sine. So the mention of division fell from the original. Or multiplying the Rectified Diameter by the Earth's diameter is an extra redundancy not needed in the operation. Also: if LM is obtained in Yojanas, LS the Modified Diameter must also be converted to them so MS is of that magnitude. On this basis, what comes out of the diameter of the Shadow would be Yojanas. He said: Then multiply the resulting Shadow by the Total Sine...",

If the Shadow resulting for him were in Yojanas, he would have had to multiply it by double the Total Sine and divide the sum by the Yojanas of the Earth's diameter for the minutes of the Shadow to come out for him. Since he did not do so, it is known that he limited himself in the operation to the Rectified Diameter in minutes without converting it to Yojanas, and used the Modified Diameter unconverted. So the Shadow came out for him in the circle whose radius is LS the Modified Diameter, while he needs it in the circle whose radius is the Total Sine. The ratio of SA resulting for him to SL the Modified Diameter is like the ratio of SA in the required magnitude to SL assuming it is the Total Sine. On this basis, he converted it. Then in another place he said: That the diameter of the Earth is 1581, the diameter of the Moon 480, the diameter of the Sun 6522, and the diameter of the Shadow 1581. Subtract the 'Yojanas' of the Earth from the Yojanas of the Sun, 4941 remains. Multiply this remainder by the Yojanas of the Modified Diameter of the Moon and divide the sum by the Yojanas of the Modified Diameter of the Sun. Whatever comes out, subtract it from 1581; the magnitude of the Shadow in the sphere of the Moon remains. Multiply it by 3416 and divide the sum by the Yojanas of the radius of the mean sphere of the Moon. The minutes of the diameter of the Shadow come out. It is known that if the Yojanas of the Earth's diameter are subtracted from the Yojanas of the Sun's diameter, the remainder is AR, I mean YW. Extend WGF and perpendicular KG on its straight line to H. The ratio of the excess YW to KG the Modified Diameter of the Sun is like the ratio of SF to HG the Modified Diameter of the Moon. Whether these two Modified ones are converted or unconverted, SF comes out in the magnitude of Yojanas. Make AN equal to HF, so HN necessarily equals diameter GD. His requirement is SA. So he must subtract what comes out for him from the Earth's diameter for SA to remain. The author of the operation is not suspected in the like of this, but the suspicion is on the corrupt manuscript. We do not pass it due to the obscurity of what is in the correct one from us. As for the assumed magnitude of the Shadow which he ordered subtracting from, it cannot be mean because the mean stands between decrease and increase. Nor...",

Then the ratio of SA obtained for him in Yojanas to SL the 'Yojanas' of the Moon's Modified Diameter is like the ratio of SA in minutes to SL assuming it is the Total Sine. By this, his requirement is obtained correctly without dividing by the radius of the mean sphere of the Moon which is extracted from the Yojanas of the sphere of the Heaven.

The derivation of the Mansions according to them is in reality like the derivation of the Zodiac Signs in dividing the Zodiac belt by them into twenty-seven equal parts, like its division in the Signs into twelve equal parts. The share of each Mansion in degrees is thirteen and a third, and in minutes eight hundred. The planetary stars enter them and exit from them and oscillate in latitude to their north and south. Each Mansion is specialized from the side of the art of astrology with what the Signs are specialized with of description, nature, indication, and property. The derivation of this number is that the Moon traverses the entire belt in twenty-seven days and a third of a day deserving cancellation. Just as the derivation of the number with the Arabs is from the first western visibility (New Moon) to the last eastern visibility. Its method is to add the motion of the Sun in the lunar month to the cycle, and subtract from the total the motion of the Moon for the two days specific to the waning (darkness), and divide the remainder by the motion of the Moon for a day. Twenty-seven comes out, and a fraction more than thirty (meaning 27 and a fraction), which deserves rounding. But the Arabs are an illiterate people who do not write or calculate. They rely only on counting and eyesight, as they know nothing but visibility and do not define the Mansions except by the stars that are in them of the fixed ones. When the Indians sought the like of that definition, they agreed with the Arabs in some stars and differed with them in some. Although the Arabs do not stray far from...",

The Indians do not adhere to this condition, but they consider alignment and opposition (zenith/nadir?) in it. Then they include the Falling Vulture (Vega/Abhijit) in the total, so the number becomes twenty-eight with it. For this reason, our astronomers and authors of books on 'Anwa' (weather stars) were deluded in this meaning and mentioned that the Mansions according to the Indians are twenty-eight and that they dropped one which is always hidden by the rays of the Sun. As if they heard the Indians naming the Mansion in which the Sun is \"Burnt\" (Combust), and the one it left \"Separated after embrace\", and the one before it \"Smoking\". Some of our companions stated the dropping of Al-Zubana (Libra scales), then explained it by the matter of the Burnt Path (Via Combusta) in the end of Libra and beginning of Scorpio. All of that from them is a conjecture that the Mansions according to the Indians are twenty-eight then dropping attaches to them. It is not so; rather, they are twenty-seven then addition attaches to them. \"Brahmagupta\" narrated that in the book \"Veda\" from those who inhabit Mount \"Meru\", that they see two suns and two moons and the Mansions are fifty-four, and the days also double for them. Then he started contradicting it by saying that we do not see the fish of the Pole rotating twice a day but once. As for me, tricks exhausted me in directing a face for this false proposition. As for knowing the position of a planet or an assumed degree from the Mansions, it is: To make its distance from the beginning of Aries all minutes and divide by eight hundred. Complete Mansions preceding the one it is in come out. The remainder is what it traversed of the broken Mansion. Either relate it to the eight hundred as they are, or folded (simplified) by agreement, or raise the minutes to degrees, or multiply by sixty and divide the sum by eight hundred to get what it traversed of it assuming the Mansion is one divided by sixty. All of these cover the Moon and planets and others. Then the Moon is specialized by dividing the product of the remainder by sixty by its Bhukti (daily motion), so what passed of the Mansion Day comes out. The Indians in the matter of fixed stars are of little yield. I did not find among them anyone who knows the stars of the Mansions by sight and points to them with fingers.

The proof of what I described them with is not apparent on them. For example, his saying on \"Ashvini\" (Sheratan), which is among the six Mansions, that vision precedes calculation in it. Its two stars in our time are in two-thirds of Aries, and the time of Varahamihira precedes us by close to five hundred and twenty-six years. By any opinion he worked regarding the motion of the fixed stars, they do not advance beyond the third of Aries. Grant that they were in it in his time or near it according to what is in \"Khandakhadyaka\", and the calculation of the two luminaries in it is correct, not showing yet what appeared in our time of its lagging by eight degrees. How then does vision precede calculation in it when the Moon, if it conjoined them, had traversed close to two-thirds of the first Mansion? On this analogy are the rest of them. Mansions only expand and contract from the side of their marks, I mean the stars, not their essences, for they are equal. This is not known to be the custom of the Indians, along with what we narrated from them regarding the Daughters of Na'sh. \"Brahmagupta\" said in \"Uttara Khandakhadyaka\", meaning his correction: That among the Mansions are those whose magnitude exceeds the magnitude of the Moon's mean motion for a day by its half. So the Mansion is 19 45 52 18 (degrees/min/sec?). They are six Mansions named \"Rohini\", \"Punarvasu\", \"Uttara Phalguni\", \"Visakha\", \"Uttara Ashadha\", \"Uttara Bhadrapada\". Their total is 118 35 13 48. Among them are six short ones, each falling short of the Moon's mean motion for a day by its half. So the Mansion is 6 35 17 26. Their names are \"Bharani\", \"Ardra\", \"Ashlesha\", \"Svati\", \"Jyeshtha\", \"Shatabhisha\". Their total is 39 31 44 36. The fifteen remaining equal each the mean motion of the Moon for a day. So the Mansion is 13 10 34 52. Their total is 197 38 43. The sum of the three totals is 355 45 41 24. There remains to the completion of the Circle 4 14 18 36, which is the share of...",

As for the Indians' lack of guidance to the motion of the fixed stars, a sufficient witness to it is the saying of \"Varahamihira\" in \"Samhita\": That it was mentioned in the books of the ancients that the summer solstice was in the half of \"Ashlesha\" and the winter one in the beginning of \"Dhanishta\". That was correct at that time. As for now, the summer one of the solstices is in the beginning of Cancer and the winter one in the beginning of Capricorn. If anyone doubts that and claims it is as the ancients mentioned not what we mentioned, let him go out to a level place where he guesses the approach of the summer solstice. Let him draw a circle in it and set up at its center a gnomon standing perpendicular to the horizon. Let him mark the tip of its shadow until it meets the circumference of the circle on one of the eastern and western sides. Let him return the next day around the like of that yesterday's time and observe like he observed first. If he finds the tip of the shadow in the line deviating from the first mark towards the south, let him know that the sun has moved towards the north and has not turned yet. If he finds it deviating towards the north, he knows that the sun has moved towards the south and has turned. If he observes that constantly and determines the day of the solstice, he will verify what we mentioned. This is proof from \"Varahamihira\" that he did not know that the fixed stars have a motion towards the east. So he made them (fixed) like their name and moved the solstice towards the west. Because of this imagination, he mixed the two matters in the Mansions. Let us distinguish between them so the doubt is removed and the speech refined. That is that the Zodiac Signs, if started from half of the sixth of the belt which is from the intersection towards the north following the second motion, the summer solstice is always at the head of the fourth Sign, and the winter one at the head of the tenth Sign. In the Mansions, if started with a third of a ninth of the belt which is from the beginning of the first Sign, the summer solstice is at three quarters of the seventh Mansion always and the winter one at a quarter of the twenty-first Mansion. That does not change throughout the duration of the world. However, if the Mansions are marked by stars and named with names following the stars, they must transfer with them.

As for their operation regarding the visibility of planets and the crescent, it is what the Zijes of Sindhind among us contain. They call the degrees assumed for the necessity of visibility \"Kalamsa\". According to what the author of \"Ghurrat al-Zijat\" mentioned: As for Canopus, Sirius, Vega, Capella, the two Simaks (Arcturus and Spica), and Antares, it is thirteen degrees. But for Botein, Heka, Praesepe, \"Ashlesha\", \"Shatabhisha\", and \"Revati\", it is twenty degrees. For the rest, fourteen degrees. Thus the matter regarding them is divided into three limits. It occurs to the imagination from them that the first limit is restricted to the stars counted by the Greeks in the first and second magnitude; the middle limit to those counted in the third and fourth magnitude; and the last limit to those counted in the fifth and sixth magnitude. This detailing was more worthy of Brahmagupta in his correction \"Khandakhadyaka\", but he did not do it. Rather, he generalized and made the degrees of visibility for all Mansions fourteen degrees. \"Vijayanandi\" said: There are stars which the rays do not hide nor does the sun strike them, and they are Capella, Arcturus, the two Vultures (Vega and Altair), \"Dhanishta\", and \"Uttara Bhadrapada\".

They see it when the sun enters the Mansion of \"Hasta\" and its setting when it enters the Mansion of \"Rohini\". \"Paulisa\" said: Double the sun's apogee; when the sun's true longitude equals it, it is the time of its disappearance. The sun's apogee according to him is two Signs and two-thirds of a Sign (80 degrees). Its double falls in the third of Virgo, which is the beginning of the Mansion Hasta. Half the apogee is in the third of Taurus, which is the beginning of the Mansion Rohini. As for \"Brahmagupta\", he claimed in the correction of Khandakhadyaka that the position of Canopus is in twenty-seven degrees of Gemini and its latitude in the south is seventy-one degrees, and its degrees of visibility are twelve. The position of \"Mrigavyadha\", which is Sirius, is in twenty-six degrees of Gemini and its latitude in the south is forty degrees, and its degrees of visibility are thirteen. If you want the time of their rising, assume the sun is in the position of the star, and the past of the day is its degrees of visibility. Set up the Ascendant on that. When the sun obtains the degree of this Ascendant, the star is seen at its first visibility. To know the time of its setting, add six Signs to the degree of the star, subtract from the sum its degrees of visibility, and set up the Ascendant on what remains. If the sun enters its degree, it is the time of its setting. In \"Samhita\", there is mention of sacrifices and customs performed at the rising of some stars. We recount them according to our translation fulfilling the condition of exhausting the stories in their manner. \"Varahamihira\" said: When the sun rose in the past and aligned with the lofty Mount \"Vindhya\" in its passage, it resented its height, and pride incited it to rise towards it to prevent it from its intent and hold back its wheel from passing over it. So it rose until it neared Paradise and the dwellings of the \"Vidyadhara\" spirits. They rushed to it for its pleasantness and the beauty of its gardens and meadows and settled it joyfully, their women frequenting it and their children playing. Until when the wind blew on the garments of their white daughters, they moved like fluttering flags. Beasts and lions are seen in its ravines, black in color from the abundance of the animal called \"Bhramara\" (Large Black Bee) and its gathering upon them longing for what their bodies were stained with upon rubbing with the stained claws, intoxicating the rutting elephants that engaged them.

When \"Agastya son of Varuna\", that is Canopus son of Water, saw that action of the mountain, he offered it companionship in what it aimed for and asked it to stay and wait until he returns to it, thus diverting it by that from what it was intent on. He turned to the sea swallowing its water until it receded and the foothills of Mount Vindhya appeared. \"Makara\" (sea monsters) and water animals clung to it scratching it until they notched it with pits and pierced it with furrows in which gems and pearls remained. So it was adorned by them and by the trees protruding on its skirts and snakes moving twistingly on its face. By Canopus wronging it, it was compensated with what it gained of adornment from which the angels benefited for the examples of their crowns and wreaths. Just as the sea was compensated by the drying of its water with the beauty of the shining of fish when they move in it, the appearance of gems in its bottom, and the movement of snakes and elephants in its remaining water. If fish, conch, and shell rise on it, you would think it ponds whose water surface is covered by white lotus in the sixth of \"Sharad\", the Autumn season. You could hardly distinguish between it and the sky due to the adornment of the sea with gems like the adornment of the sky with stars, the resemblance of the multi-headed snakes to the threads of rays emanating from the sun, and the likeness of the crystal in it to the body of the moon and the white vapor which the clouds of the sky surmount. How can I not praise him who did this great deed, alerted the angels to the beauty of crowns, and made the sea and Mount \"Vindhya\" a treasury for them! That is Canopus by whom the water is purified from the earthy dirts mixing with it, like the purification of the heart of the righteous man from what overcame it in the company of the wicked. Whenever he rose and water decreased in rivers and valleys in his time, you saw rivers offering to the moon what is on the water surface of types of white and red lotus and blue lotus, and types of ducks and flamingos swimming in it as an offering to him, like the young girl offers flowers and gifts upon her entry.

If you saw the ponds then, the moonlight shining upon them illuminating their stagnant water, and what had closed upon Bhramara of their white lotus opening, you would think them the face of a beautiful woman looking with a black eye from a white eyeball. If the flood coming from the torrents of \"Varsha-kala\" (Rainy Season) had flowed to them with snakes, poisons, and filth, the rising of Canopus upon them purifies them from impurity and saves them from harm. If the thought of mentioning Canopus at the door of a human is erasing of his sins necessitating punishment, then the loosening of the tongue in praising him is more effective in removing burdens and earning reward! The early Rishis mentioned what offering is obligatory at the rising of Canopus. I present the kings with its story and make it an offering to him. I say: His rising is at the time when some light of the sun appears from the East and the darkness of the night gathers in the West. His first appearance is difficult to perceive; not every observer is guided to it. Ask the astrologer at that time about the direction of his rising. Present the offering called \"Arghya\" to that direction. Spread on the ground what agrees of fragrant flowers and aromatic plants according to that spot. Throw upon it what appears to you of gold, clothes, and sea gems. Present incense, saffron, sandalwood, musk, and camphor with a bull, a cow, much food, and sweets. Know that whoever does that for seven consecutive years with good intention, strong belief, and trust will possess after that all the earth and the sea surrounding it from the four directions if he is a \"Kshatriya\". If he is a \"Brahmin\", he attains his desire, learns the \"Veda\", possesses a beautiful wife, and is blessed with noble children from her. If he is a \"Vaisya\", he obtains many lands and acquires a great chieftainship. If he is a \"Sudra\", he obtains wealth. Then health, security, disappearance of afflictions, and attainment of reward encompass all of them. This is what was mentioned of the offering of Canopus. As for the judgments of \"Rohini\", \"Varahamihira\" said in it that \"Garga\", \"Vasistha\", \"Kasyapa\", and \"Parashara\" told their students that Mount \"Meru\" is built of plates of gold. It has appeared...",

The harlots of \"Deva\" frequent it with enchanting songs, distracting amusements, and constant joy. This mountain is in the wilderness of \"Nandana Vana\", which is the garden of Paradise. They said: Jupiter was in it once, so \"Narada\" the Rishi asked him about the judgments of \"Rohini\" until he explained them to him. I recount them as is their duty. Look in the black days of the month \"Ashadha\" until the moon reaches Rohini. Seek in the direction of the North from the town or in its East a high place. The Brahmin entrusted with the houses of kings should go to it. He lights a fire in it and depicts the planets and Mansions around it with their colors. He performs the duty of reading what is for each one of them, giving it its share of flowers, barley, and oil, and pleasing it by throwing them into the fire. Let there be around it in the four directions what is possible of gems and jars filled with the sweetest waters, and what exists at that time of fruits, medicines, tree branches, and plant roots. Grass cut with a sickle is spread there for sleeping. Then he gathers types of seeds and grains, washes them with water, places gold in their middle, deposits them in a jar, and puts it aside. He performs \"Homa\", which is throwing barley and oil into the fire while reading passages from \"Veda\" attributed to directions, which are \"Varuna Mantra\", \"Vayavya Mantra\", and \"Saumya Mantra\". He sets up a \"Danda\", which is a long high spear, hanging from its head two streamers, one equal to the spear and the second like three times its double. Let him do all of that before the moon reaches \"Rohini\" so that when it reaches it, he is free to estimate the times of the wind blowing and the directions of its blowing. That is known from the streamers of the spear. If the wind blows on that day from the hearts of the four directions, its matter is praised. If it blows from between them, it is blamed. Its steadiness on one direction with strength without variation is also praised. The time of its blowing is estimated by eighths of the day, and for each...",

If nothing decreases from them, the summer rain is complete. Likewise, evidence is taken from the jars regarding the castes. The North jar is for Brahmins, the East jar for Kshatriyas, the South jar for Vaisyas, and the West jar for Sudras.

Face the East in weighing. Place the weight in the right pan and the weighed items in the left. While you recite over them and say to the balance: You are the straight one, you are \"Deva\" and the wife of Deva, and you are \"Sarasvati daughter of Brahma\" manifesting truth and honesty. You are more correct than straightness itself. You are like the sun and stars in their passage from East to West on one mode. By you the order of the world is straightened, and in you is gathered what all angels and Brahmins have of honesty and correctness. You are the daughter of Brahma and your household is \"Kasyapa\". Let this weighing be in the evening. Then put them aside and repeat their weighing in the morning. Whatever increased in weight is thriving and fortunate in that year, and what decreased is bad and unfortunate. Do not limit yourself with this weighing without doing it in \"Rohini\" and in \"Svati\". If the year is \"Adhimasa\" and the weighing happens in the repeated month, repeat the operation in it.

As for the reason for the sea water remaining as it is, it is said in \"Matsya Purana\": That sixteen mountains in ancient times had wings with which they flew and rose. The rays of \"Indra\" the Chief burned them until they fell around the sea clipped of wings, four in every direction. The Eastern ones: \"Rishabha, Valahaka, Chakra, Mainaka\". The Northern ones: \"Chandra, Kanka, Drona, Suma\". The Western ones: \"Vakra, Vadhra, Narada, Parvata\". The Southern ones: \"Jimuta, Dravina, Mainaka, Mahasaila\". Between the third and fourth of the Eastern mountains is the fire \"Samvartaka\" which drinks the sea water. Were it not for that, it would have filled up due to the constant pouring of rivers into it. They said: It is the fire of a king they had named \"Aurva\". It is that he inherited the kingdom from his father who was killed while he was a fetus. When he was born and grew up and heard the news of his father, he became angry at the angels and drew his sword to kill them because of their neglect in preserving the world despite people worshipping them and drawing near to him (them?). They pleaded with him and placated him until he refrained. He said to them: So what should I do with the fire of my anger? They advised him to throw it into the sea, and it is the one that drinks its water. They also said: The water of rivers does not increase in the seas because Indra the Chief takes them with the cloud and sends them as rains. It is also said in Matsya Purana: That the dark spot called \"Shashalakshana\", meaning the image of the hare, is the reflection of the images of the sixteen mentioned mountains by the moon's light onto its body. In the book \"Vishnu Dharma\": The moon is called \"Shashalakshana\" because the sphere of its body is watery accepting the image of the earth as a mirror accepts it.

It is also called \"Mrigalanchana\", meaning the mark of the deer, because a group likened the dark spot in its face to the image of a deer. They said regarding the Lunar Mansions that they are the daughters of \"Prajapati\" and that the moon married them. Then he became fond of Rohini among them and preferred her over them. Jealousy drove her sisters to complain about him to their father. He strove with him to treat them equally and admonished him, but it did not work on him. Then he cursed him until his face became leprous. The moon regretted his deed and came to him repenting for his sin. Prajapati said to him: My word is one, there is no return in it. But I will cover your disgrace for half of every month. The moon said: So the past sin, how will its trace be erased from me? He said: By setting up the image of \"Linga Mahadeva\" as an object of service for you. He did so. It is the stone of \"Somnath\". \"Soma\" is the moon and \"Natha\" is the master, so it is \"The Master of the Moon\". Prince Mahmud (of Ghazni), may Allah be pleased with him, uprooted it in the year four hundred and sixteen Hijri. He broke its top and carried it with its gold covering encrusted and crowned with gems to his residence in Ghazni. Part of it is thrown in its hippodrome with \"Chakrasvamin\", the copper idol carried from \"Thanesar\", and part of it is at the door of its congregational mosque for feet to wipe dust and wetness on it. As for Linga, it is the image of the penis of Mahadeva. I heard regarding its cause: That a Rishi saw him with his wife and thought ill of him and prayed against him to lose his penis. It separated from him and fell off immediately. Then he established signs of his innocence with that Rishi and verified them with proofs, until what he harbored in his heart was removed. He said: I will compensate you by making the image of the organ that separated from you verified among people, used as a means and approached. \"Varahamihira\" mentioned regarding its making: After choosing the stone for it free from defects, the length intended to be made for it is taken. It is divided into thirds. The bottom third of it is squared as if it is a cube or square cylinder. The middle third is octagonalized by removing its four corners. The top third is rounded and its head rounded off until it becomes like the glans. In setting it up, the square third of it is placed in the belly of the earth. For the octagonal third, a cover called \"Pinda\" is made, square on its outside matching the squareness of what entered the earth from it, and the octagon of the inside fits the middle third protruding from the earth. The round part remains outside the cover. Then...",

A little depression in it or protrusion from it sickens them. If it is hit during manufacture by a peg, the chief and his household perish. If it is bumped on the way of carrying it and the bump leaves a mark on it, its maker perishes and corruption and diseases spread in that land. In the southwestern lands from the lands of Sindh, this image abounds in the houses designated for their worship. However, \"Somnath\" was the most venerated of them. A jar of Ganges water and a basket of Kashmir flowers were carried to it every day. Their belief in it is that it heals chronic illnesses and cures every incurable disease that has no medicine. It became famous because it is a harbor for travelers in the sea and a station for those going back and forth between Sofala of the Zanj and China. As for the matter of tides in this sea: Tide in their language is \"Bharana\" and Ebb is \"Uhara\". They believe, as for their commoners, that in the sea is a fire named \"Vadavanala\" constantly breathing. The tide is from its inhaling breath and swelling with wind, and the ebb is from its exhaling breath and the disappearance of swelling from it. Like what \"Mani\" believed when he heard from them that there is a demon in the sea whose breathing in and out causes the tide and ebb. As for their elite, they know them in the day by the rising and setting of the moon and in the month by the increase and decrease of its light, even if they are not guided to the natural cause in them. They attached the name of the moon to \"Somnath\" because this stone was set up on the coast west of the mouth of the river \"Saraswati\" in the sea by less than a third of a mile and east of the place of the golden fortress \"Baroi\" (?) which appeared to Basudeva until he inhabited it, and near his killing place and the killing places of his tribe and the place of their burning. Whenever the moon rose and set, the sea water rose by the tide and drowned it (the Linga). When it reached the meridian of noon and night, it receded by the ebb and revealed it. So it was as if the moon was diligent in serving and washing it. Therefore, it was attributed to it. As for the fortress built around it and around its treasures, it is not ancient but was made nearly a hundred years ago. It is mentioned in \"Vishnu Purana\": That the maximum...",

That is because the Maldives islands on this example originate and protrude from the water like a gathered sand dune, and increase in height and expanse and remain for a time. Then old age afflicts them, so they dissolve from cohesion and spread in the water like a melting thing and disappear. The people of those islands move from the old island whose corruption appeared to the young fresh one whose time of appearance is near. They move coconut palms to it and inhabit and dwell in it. The attribution of the fortress also to gold is possible to be a conventional name, and possible to be a true description, for the islands of the Zanj are called \"The Land of Gold\" because much gold settles in the washing of little soil from it.",

As for the fact that the eclipsing agent of the moon is the earth's shadow and the eclipsing agent of the sun is the moon, their astrologers have verified it and built their calculations in the Zijes and others upon it. \"Varahamihira\" said in the book \"Samhita\": That some scholars claimed that the Head (Rahu) was among the \"Daityas\" and his mother was \"Simhika\". That the angels when they extracted Amrita from the sea asked \"Vishnu\" to distribute it among them. He did so. The Head came resembling the angels in form and entered among them. When Vishnu handed him the share of Amrita, he took it and drank it. Vishnu knew his matter, so he struck him with the round Chakra and severed his head. The head remained alive because of the Amrita in the mouth, and the body died as it had not reached it nor had its power spread in it. The Head pleaded saying: For what sin was this done to me? So he was compensated by being raised to the sky and made one of its inhabitants. Some of them said that the Head has a body like the two luminaries except that it is black and dark, so it is not seen in the sky. \"Brahma\", the First Father, ordered him not to appear in the sky at all except at the time of the eclipse. Some said that it has a head like a snake's head and a tail like its tail. Others said that it has no body other than this blackness that is seen. When \"Varahamihira\" finished recounting the myths, he said: If the Head had a body, its action would be by contact, yet we find it eclipsing at a distance when there are six Signs between it and the moon.

If a goer goes to that by committing (an error), let him inform why cycles were made for its motion and why they were correct with its uniformity. If a snake with a head and tail is imagined in it, why does it not eclipse in what is less than six Signs or more? And its body is there present between its head and tail and they are connected by it. So it does not eclipse anything of the two luminaries nor of the stars of the Mansions unless they are two heads opposite eclipsing. If it were so, then the moon rose eclipsed by one of them, the sun must set eclipsed by the other. Likewise, if the moon set eclipsed, the sun rose eclipsed. None of that exists as such. So the lunar eclipse, according to what the scholars supported by Allah mentioned, is its entry into the shadow, and the solar eclipse is the moon covering it from us. For this reason, the beginning of the eclipse in the moon is not from the west side nor in the sun from the east side. An elongated shadow may extend from the earth like the extension of a tree's shadow, for example. If the moon's latitude is little while it is in the seventh Sign from the sun and its magnitude in north or south is not much, it enters the earth's shadow and is eclipsed by it. The first contact is from the east side. As for the sun, the moon comes to it from the west side and covers it like a piece of cloud covers it. The amount of covering differs in locations. Because the coverer of the moon is large, its light vanishes when half of it is eclipsed, and the coverer of the sun is not large, therefore it has strong rays with the eclipse. The entity of the Head has no entry in the eclipse itself. On this is the agreement of scholars in their books. When \"Varahamihira\" finished describing the quiddity of the two eclipses according to his knowledge, he was pained by those ignorant of them and said: But the common people multiply riot in attributing the eclipse to the Head and say were it not for the appearance of the Head and its undertaking of the eclipse, the Brahmins would not perform a mandatory washing then. Varahamihira said: The reason for that is that the Head, when it pleaded at the cutting, \"Brahma\" allotted him a share of the Brahmins' offering to the fire at the time of the eclipse.

Therefore, people's mention of him abounds then, and they attribute the eclipse to him, while he has nothing to do with it from his side; rather, it is from the alignment of the moon's path or its deviation. This from Varahamihira, along with the preceding evidences of his verification of the configuration of the world, is denounced, were it not that he humors the Brahmins sometimes, for he is one of them and must be of their group. Then he is not blamed given the firmness of his foot on the truth and his declaration of it, like what we recounted about him also regarding the nature of \"Sandhi\". Would that all virtuous men imitate him! But look at \"Brahmagupta\", and he is the best of this class among them. Since he was of the Brahmins who read from their Puranas the lowness of the sun below the moon, they need a Head to bite the sun to eclipse it. He rejected the truth and supported falsehood, even if it is possible that he was mocking or compelled like one fainting from death due to intense indignation with them. This is his speech in the first treatise of \"Brahmasiddhanta\": That some people view that the eclipse is not from the Head. That is an impossible opinion, for he is the eclipsing one, and the majority of the people of the world say that the Head is the one who eclipses. In \"Veda\", which is the word of Allah from the mouth of \"Brahma\", that the Head eclipses. Likewise it is in the book \"Smriti\" which \"Manu\" made, and in \"Samhita\" which \"Garga son of Brahma\" made. As for \"Varahamihira\", \"Srishena\", \"Aryabhata\", and \"Vishnuchandra\", they claim that the eclipse is not from the Head but is from the moon and the earth's shadow. This from them is opposition to the majority and hostility to the mentioned speech. For if the Head were not the eclipsing one, what the Brahmins do of anointing with heated oil and other rituals of worship prescribed for the time of the eclipse would be waste with no reward for it. In invalidating that is a departure from consensus, which is not permissible. Manu said in Smriti: If the Head takes one of the luminaries by eclipse, all water on earth becomes pure and becomes like the water of \"Ganges\" in purity. In Veda: That the Head is the son of a woman from the daughters of \"Daitya\" named \"Simhika\". For this reason, what is done of acts of righteousness is done. So it is obligatory on these to leave stubbornness against the majority because all that is in \"Veda\", \"Smriti\", and \"Samhita\" is correct. Since \"Brahmagupta\" in this place is among those about whom Allah Almighty said: \"And they rejected them, while their...",

And you calculated their eclipse according to the requirement of the opinion of these opponents, not the opinion of those you saw fit to agree with? Even if the Brahmins are commanded to establish worship or something else at the existence of the eclipse, the eclipse is a time for it, not that the action is for its sake. Just as we were commanded to prayers and forbidden from them at states of the sun and its light made as signs for their times, without the sun having any entry in our worship.

The land of India compared to its totality is small and little, and those who differ with the Indians in opinion and religion are more than those who agree with them. If he means by it the majority of Indians, their commoners are more than their elite, and the majority in our revealed books is blameworthy and described with ignorance, doubt, and lack of gratitude. I do not think anything led Brahmagupta to what he said except a branch of Socratic tribulation he was afflicted with despite the abundance of his knowledge and sharpness of his mind with his young age and youthfulness. For he made \"Brahmasiddhanta\" while he was thirty years old. If this is his excuse, we have accepted it, and peace. As for the mentioned people who should not be opposed, when do they submit to the subject of astronomers regarding the moon eclipsing the sun when they have placed it in their Puranas above the sun, and the higher does not cover the lower from who is lower than both. So they needed a grabber of the two luminaries like the fish grabbing the loaf and shaping it with the shape of the eclipsed one of them. No nation is devoid of ignorant people and leaders for them who are more ignorant 'bearing their burdens and burdens with their burdens' and increasing their minds in rust to their rust. Then among the wonders is what \"Varahamihira\" narrated from the ancients...",

    "text": "...whose pardon is obligatory if differing from them is not obligatory, that they used to infer the occurrence of the eclipse by pouring a small amount of water with the like of it of oil in a wide flat-bottomed vessel on the eighth day of the lunar days, and observing the places of the oil's gathering and separation. They used to attribute the beginning of the eclipse to the gathered and its end to the place of separation. He narrated from some that they thought the cause of the eclipse was the conjunction of the wandering planets, and that some of them used to infer its occurrence from the occurrences of misfortunes which are meteors, shooting stars, halo, darkness, storms, tremors, and earthquakes. He said: These things do not always happen with the eclipse nor are they the cause of its occurrence, but they share with it in the nature of misfortune. The path of reason is far from these myths. The man, with his achievement over the nature of his people in mixing mung bean with soup (?) and pearls with dung, said without quoting anyone: If a strong wind blows at the time of the eclipse, the eclipse following it will be after it by six months. If a star shoots (meteor), the eclipse following it will be after twelve months. If the atmosphere becomes dusty, then after eighteen months. If the earth quakes, then after twenty-four months. If the air darkens, then after thirty months. If hail falls, then after thirty-six months. I see silence about this as an answer. However, I say that what is in the Zij of Al-Khwarizmi regarding the colors of the eclipse, even if organized in speech, is contrary to witnessing. What the Indians hold of it is more correct and right, which is that the eclipse falling short of half the moon's body is smoke-colored. If it completes half, its color becomes jet black. If it exceeds half, redness mixes with its jet-blackness until if it is complete, it is after that yellow with blondness.",

Multiply one of them by fifty and divide the sum by 1296 and round up its fraction if it does not fall short of half. Add 1063 to the result and the sum to the other place. Then divide the amount by 180. What comes out of integers is the complete Parvas. Cast away sevens; what remains is not more, so count from their first which is for Brahma. What remains of the division less than 180 is the past of the \"Parva\" you are in. Subtract it from one hundred and eighty. If less than fifteen remains, a lunar eclipse is possible then necessary. If more remains, it is impossible. On this basis, the past should be considered by its like. It was found in another place: Take \"Kalpa Ahargana\", I mean what passed of Kalpa days, and subtract from them 96031. Place what remains in two places.

What comes out cast it away, and what remains divide it by seven. The Parva comes out, and their first is \"Brahma\". There is no agreement between the two operations. It seems something fell from the second operation or was changed by copying. What \"Varahamihira\" mentioned of the judgments of Parva contradicts what he had of good achievement. That is that he said: If there is no eclipse in the assumed Parva then it occurs in the other cycle, rains are lacking and hunger and killing rise. This, if no oversight occurred from the translator in it, covers every preceding Parva in which there is an eclipse. More amazing than this is his saying: If vision precedes in the eclipse and calculation delays, rain decreases and the sword is drawn. If vision delays and calculation precedes, there is epidemic, death, and corruption in crops, fruits, and aromatic plants. He said: This is among what I found in the books of the ancients so I transmitted it. As for him who masters calculation and perfects it, precedence or delay does not occur in what he calculates.

The strictness in it is less than the strictness in the matter of \"Yajnopavita\", for Yajnopavita is something he never separates from. If he puts it down so he eats or relieves himself without it, he becomes thereby a sinner whom nothing purifies except expiation by fasting or charity.

He carries to the fire its firewood from the two trees \"Palasha\" and \"Darbha\" for making the sacrifice. Fire is venerated among them and approached with lights, and likewise among other nations. They used to see the acceptance of the offering by the descent of fire upon it, and worship of idols, stars, cows, donkeys, or images did not dissuade them from it. For this reason Bashar bin Burd said: 'And Fire has been worshipped since Fire existed.' As for the second section, it is from the twenty-fifth year to the fiftieth.

So he marries and establishes a household (Grihastha) and intends offspring, on condition that he does not have intercourse with his wife more than once a month following the woman's purification from menstruation. He is not allowed to marry a woman whose age has exceeded twelve. His livelihood is either from teaching Brahmins and \"Kshatriyas\", and what reaches him from it is by way of honor not by way of wage; or from a gift given to him because of what fire sacrifices he performs for others; or by asking from kings and nobles without persistence from him in request or dislike from the giver.

It was only permitted for necessity if it is unavoidable. The Brahmin is not obligated to kings what is obligated to others of taxes and duties. As for dealing in beasts, cows, dyes, and benefiting from usury, it is forbidden for him. Indigo dye among the dyes is impure; if it touches his body, washing is obligatory upon him.

He devotes himself to thought and stripping the heart of friendships and enmities, and rejecting desire, greed, and anger. He does not associate with anyone at all. If he intends a place of virtue seeking reward, he does not stay on his way in a village more than a day and in a town more than five days. If anyone gives him something, he does not leave a remainder of it for tomorrow. He has nothing but diligence on the conditions of the path leading to salvation and reaching \"Moksha\" in which there is no return to the world. As for what is obligatory upon him in all his life generally, it is acts of righteousness, giving charity and taking it—for what is given to Brahmins returns to the Fathers—and continuous reading and performing sacrifices, and maintaining a fire he kindles, offers to, serves, and preserves from extinguishing so he is burned with it after his death; its name is \"Homa\". And washing every day three times: at the \"Sandhi\" of rising which is dawn, at the Sandhi of setting which is twilight, and at noon between them. As for in the morning, it is because of the night's sleep and the relaxation of vents in it, so it is purification from occurring impurity and preparation for prayer. Prayer is glorification, praise, and prostration according to their custom on the two thumbs of the joined palms towards the sun, for it is the Qibla wherever it is except the South. Nothing of good deeds is done towards this direction, nor does one advance towards it except in every bad thing. As for the time of the sun's decline from noon, it is designated for earning reward, so he must be pure in it. Evening is the time of supper and prayer, and he is allowed to do them in it without washing.",

The washing obligatory upon him at night is only at times of eclipses for establishing their conditions and sacrifices. The Brahmin lunches in all his life twice a day at noon and evening. If he wants food, he begins by setting aside charity from it for a person or two, especially for the wild (ascetic) Brahmins who come at the time of Asr (afternoon) to beg. Neglecting feeding them is a great sin. Then for beasts, birds, and the fire. He glorifies over the remainder and eats it. What remains of it he places outside the house and does not approach it as it is not lawful for him. It is only for whoever happens to pass by of those in need of it, whether human, bird, dog, or other. The water vessel must be separate, otherwise it is broken, and likewise his eating utensils. I have seen Brahmins who permitted eating with their relatives in one bowl, while the rest of them denied that. He is required to dwell between the river \"Sindh\" towards the North and the river \"Charmanvati\" (Chambal) towards the South. He does not exceed them to the borders of the Turks and the borders of Karnata and the sea on the sides of the East and West. For it is mentioned that it is not lawful for him to stay in a land that does not grow the grass he wears as a ring on the ring finger, and in which black-haired gazelles do not graze. That is the description of what is beyond the mentioned borders. If he crosses them to what is beyond, he is a sinner and expiation is required of him. As for the lands where the entire floor of the house prepared for food is not plastered with mud, but a \"Mandala\" is made for each of the eaters by pouring water on a spot and plastering it with cow dung, the shape of the Brahmin's Mandala must be square. He who makes the Mandala claimed as a reason for it: That the place of eating becomes impure by eating; and that when finished, it is washed and plastered to be pure. If the impure place is not specified, all places are reckoned due to ambiguity. Five types of plants are forbidden to him by text: Onions, Garlic, Gourd, a root of a plant like carrots called \"Ghrinjana\", and another plant growing around their ponds called \"Nali\".",

He is allowed to wear only one Yajnopavita made of two threads. As for the \"Sudra\", he is like a slave to the Brahmin, attending to his affairs and serving him. If he wants not to be without a Yajnopavita for asceticism, he wears the cotton one only. Every deed specific to the Brahmin of glorifications, reading Veda, and fire sacrifices is forbidden to him to the extent that if it is proven against him and the Vaisya that they read the Veda, the Brahmins raise them to the ruler so he cuts off their tongues. As for the remembrance of Allah and doing good and charity, he is not prevented from it. Whoever undertakes what is not for his class to undertake, like the Brahmin trading and the \"Sudra\" farming, is a sinner, even if the amount of his sin falls short of theft.

Rama began investigating that until he was guided to a \"Chandala\" striving in worship and self-mortification. He rode to him and found him on the bank of the river \"Ganges\" having hung himself upside down. Rama strung his bow and struck his neck (or chest?) with the arrow, piercing it. He said: Here it is! I kill you for a good deed that is not yours to do. He returned, and the Brahmin's son placed at his door had come to life. Then other people below the Chandala who are not Indians are called \"Mleccha\", meaning impure ones, and they are those who kill, slaughter, and eat cow meat. All these are of the disparity of degrees in which some take others in mockery. Otherwise, \"Basudeva\" said regarding the seeker of salvation: The wise man equates the Brahmin and the Chandala, the friend and the enemy, the trustworthy and the traitor, indeed the snake and the weasel. If it is reason that equated, then it is ignorance that separated and differentiated. Basudeva said to Arjuna: If the cultivation of the world is the intended goal, and policy in it does not proceed except by fighting to suppress corruption, it is obligatory upon us, the assembly of the wise, to work and fight, not to complete a deficiency in us but for its obligation from the side of treatment and negation of ruin.

They differ also in duration so that only one whose life is long is capable of them, and that is nonexistent in this time. Therefore, many of them were suspended and few remained for use. Fire according to them is an eater of all things. Therefore, it becomes impure by the entry of impurities into it like water. Because of that, Indians are not lenient regarding both if they are with someone not of them due to their becoming impure by him. Whatever fire is fed of its share returns to the \"Devas\" because it comes out of their mouths. What the Brahmin feeds it is oil and various grains of wheat, barley, and rice he throws into it. He reads from the Veda what is prescribed for that if the sacrifice is for himself. He does not read anything over it if it is for another.

In every place described with virtue, the Indians build tanks intended for bathing. That became for them a craft in which they exaggerate, such that when our people see them, they marvel at them and are unable to describe them, let alone construct them. For they build them from very large stones, extremely well-fitted, fastened with thick iron clamps, as stairs like shelves. The step circles the sides of the tank with a thickness taller than the stature of a man. Then they make on the face between the two steps ascents like crenellations. So the first steps become like paths, and the crenellations are steps. If many people descended and others ascended, they would not meet, nor would a path be blocked for them due to the multitude of steps, and the one ascending in them can turn to other than the one the descender descends upon. Thus, the hardship of crowding is removed. In Multan, there is a tank in which they worship by bathing if they are not interfered with. In \"Samhita\" of \"Varahamihira\", there is a tank in Thanesar which the Indians seek from afar and bathe in its water. They claim that its cause is the visit of the waters of other honored tanks to it at the time of the eclipse, and that bathing in it for that reason substitutes for bathing in each one of them. Then he says, narrating: They say, were it not that the Head (Rahu) is the eclipser of the two luminaries, the tanks would not visit that tank. The fame of tanks for virtue is either by the occurrence of a great matter in them or a text mentioned in books and reports. I have mentioned speech narrated by \"Shaunaka\", transmitting it from Venus from \"Brahm\", that he was addressed with it. In that speech is the mention of King \"Bali\" and what will be done to him until \"Narayan\" sinks him into the lower earth.

Then if the preference of spots is from the side of a religious command, there occurs in those acting upon it what is not uprooted from their hearts forever.

They say that the shedder of blood is held accountable for his sin, requited for his crime, unless he enters the city of Varanasi, where he attains pardon and forgiveness.

The custom at that time was that the head of the slain be taken by the hand of the slayer and remain suspended from it for disgrace and sign. Likewise, it adhered «2», so the head of Brahm stuck to the hand of Mahadev. He used to roam with it in his destinations and activities, not separating from it in whatever lands he entered, until he reached Varanasi. The head fell from his hand when he entered it and separated from it. Among the likes of those lands is \"Pushkara\". Its cause: That Brahm was establishing a sacrifice to the fire in it, and a boar came out of it. Therefore, they made his idol in the form of a boar. Outside the town in three places of it, honored tanks were made which are places of worship. Among them is \"Thanesar\", called \"Kurukshetra\", meaning the land of \"Kuru\".

Wealth is not left until a year passes over it or a month passes, for that is referring to an unknown; man does not know if he will reach it. As for what he obtains from the side of crops or cattle, the obligatory in it is to begin for the ruler by paying the tax (Kharaj) which is due on the land or pasture, and the sixth as a wage for him for defending the subjects and protecting their wealth and harem. That exactly is obligatory on the common people (merchants/craftsmen), except that they lie about it and betray. Taxes are obligatory on trades for the like of it.

Then regarding the yield after taking that out of the property, some of them see in it the ninth for charity, because he sees in a third of it saving so the heart is reassured by it, and in a third of it to be spent in trade to bear fruit by profit, and in the remaining third to give a third of it in charity and spend two-thirds in the house. The matter regarding what comes out of profit is on this rule. Some of them see dividing it into quarters: a quarter of it for expenditure, a quarter for adornment and establishing chivalry, a quarter for charity, and a quarter for saving if it is sufficient for expenditure for three years. If the quarter for saving exceeds this amount, he separates from it what does not fall short of expenditure for three years and gives the excess in charity.

I heard others say that the Brahmins used to be harmed by eating cow meat because their lands are hot lowlands and the interiors of bodies in them are cold, the natural heat in them is lukewarm, and the digestive power is weak. They strengthen them by eating Betel leaves after food and chewing Areca nut. The Betel with its sharpness inflames the heat and dries the moisture of the lime on it, and the Areca nut strengthens the teeth and gums and astringes the stomach. Since it was so, they forbade it for its thickness and coldness. I think in that one of two matters: Either politics, for the cow is the animal that serves in travels by carrying loads and weights, and in agriculture by plowing and sowing, and in household management by milk and what comes out of it. Then benefit is derived from its dung, indeed in winter from its breath. So it was forbidden as Al-Hajjaj forbade it when the ruin of the Sawad (fertile lands of Iraq) was complained to him. Or, it was narrated to me that in some of their books: That all things are one thing, and in prohibition and permission equal. They only differ due to inability and ability. So the wolf is capable of smashing the sheep, so it is its food, and the sheep is incapable against it, so it became its prey. I found in their books what testified to the like of it, except that this is for the Knower with his knowledge if he attains in it a rank where the Brahmin and the \"Chandala\" are equal to him. If it is so, other things are also equal to him in refraining from them. So whether they were all lawful since he is dispensed «1» with regarding them, or were forbidden, he is not desirous of them. As for him who has a need in them due to the mastery of ignorance over him, some are lawful for him and some are forbidden to him, and the wall between them is set up.",

Whoever contemplates the pairing of animals and the restriction of each pair of them to a mate and the cutting off of the greeds of others from them, deems marriage necessary and contains fornication out of disdain for falling short of the rank of what is below him of animals. Every nation has customs in it, especially those among them who claimed a Sharia and divine commands for themselves. It is the affair of the Indians that marriage among them is at a young age; therefore the parents contract it for their children. The Brahmins establish the rites of sacrifices in it, and charity is spread among them and others, and instruments of joy appear. No dowry is named between them. Rather, there is in it for the woman a gift according to ambition and a present given in advance which is not permissible to take back unless the woman gives it willingly of herself. Nothing separates the spouses except death, as they have no divorce. A man may marry more than one up to four. What is above four is forbidden to him unless one of those under his hand dies, then he completes the number with another and does not exceed it. As for the woman, if her husband dies, she does not have the right to marry. She is between one of two matters: either to remain a widow all her life or to burn herself, and that is the better of her two states because she remains in torment for the duration of her life. Of their custom regarding the wives of their kings...",

They do not leave of them except the old women or those with children if the son guarantees the maintenance of the mother and her protection. The law in marriage according to them is that strangers are better than relatives. What is farther in lineage of relatives is better than what is near in it. As for what ran straight downwards, meaning the daughter of children and children of children, and upwards of mother and grandmother and their mothers, it is forbidden absolutely. As for what «1» deviated from straightness and branched to the two sides, of sister, sister's daughter, paternal aunt, maternal aunt, and their daughters, it is likewise in prohibition unless they are separated by generations of five consecutive wombs in birth; then the prohibition ceases with the persistence of dislike. Some of them view the number of women according to classes, so that the Brahmin has four, the Kshatriya three, the Vaishya two, and the Shudra one. It is permissible for each one of the people of the classes to marry in his class and what is below it, and it is not lawful for him to marry from a class above his class. The child is attributed to the class of the mother, not the father. If the wife of the Brahmin, for example, is a Brahmin, the child is likewise; and if she is a Shudra, he is a Shudra. But the Brahmins in our time, even if that is lawful for them, do not do it and do not exceed in marriage other than their class. As for menstruation, its maximum by visibility is sixteen days, and by verification it is the first four days. Approaching a woman in them is forbidden; indeed nearing her in the house is likewise, for she is then impure. If the four days expire and she bathes, she is pure and approaching her is lawful. If the blood does not stop from her, then that is not menstruation but rather material for embryos. It is obligatory on the Brahmin if he wants to approach women seeking a child to establish a sacrifice to the fire called \"Garbhadhana\". He only does not do it because he needs the presence of the woman in it, and shame prevents that. So it is delayed and combined with the one following it in the fourth month of pregnancy and called \"Simantonnayana\". If the woman delivers her load, a third sacrifice is established between the birth and breastfeeding called \"Jatakarma\". He is not named with a name except after the expiration of the days of puerperium. The sacrifice of the name is called \"Namakarma\". As long as the woman is in puerperium, she does not approach a vessel, and nothing is eaten in her house...",

It is, by my life, a virtuous way, but the people of the world are not all philosophers. Rather, most of them are ignorant, astray; nothing straightens them except the sword and the whip. Since \"Constantine\" the Victorious became Christian, neither of them «1» rested from movement (sword and whip), for without them politics is not complete. Likewise the Indians. They mentioned that matters of governance and wars were in the past to the Brahmins, and in that was the corruption of the world from the perspective that they conducted politics according to the requirements of the books of the creed of rational conduct, and that was not consistent for them with those of mischief and viciousness. The matter almost incapacitated them from undertaking what was to them of the matter of religion, so they pleaded to their Lord regarding it, until \"Brahm\" singled them out for what was to them and assigned politics and fighting to \"Kshatriya\". Therefore, the livelihood of the Brahmins became from begging and solicitation. Punishments among people for sins occurred from the side of kings, not scholars. As for the matter of killing, if the killer is a Brahmin and the killed is from other classes, nothing is binding on him except expiation, and it is by fasting, prayer, and charity.

The greatest of them is killing a Brahmin, and its burden is called \"Brahma Hatya\". Then killing a cow, then drinking wine, then fornication, especially with who belongs to his father or his teacher. However, the rulers do not exact retribution (Qisas) from a \"Brahmin\" or \"Kshatriya\", but they confiscate his wealth and exile him from their kingdoms. As for those below the Brahmins and Kshatriyas, if some of them kill others, it is expiated by expiation, but the rulers execute retribution among them for example. As for theft, the punishment of the thief is according to its magnitude. It might necessitate mutilation by excess and moderation, and it might necessitate discipline and fining, and it might necessitate restricting to scandal and publicizing. If the amount is great, the rulers blind the Brahmin or cut him from opposite sides (hand and foot), and cut the Kshatriya and do not blind him, and kill others. The punishment of the adulteress is to be expelled from the husband's house and exiled. I used to hear that he who flees from the Indian slaves returning to their lands and religion, fasting is imposed on him for expiation, and he is soaked in cow dung, urine, and milk for numbered days until he ferments in them, and he exits from impurity and is fed what resembles what he is in, and likes of that. I asked the Brahmins about it, and they denied it and claimed that there is no expiation for him and no license in returning him to what he was in.

The debts of the deceased are on the heir; he pays them from what he inherited or from his own money, whether the deceased left something or did not leave. Likewise, the mentioned expenses are binding on him in any case. The principle regarding heirs, and they are males inevitably, is that the lower from the deceased is more confirmed in matter and more entitled to inheritance than the one above him. I mean that the son and his children are more entitled than the father and grandfathers. Then what is in one side of low and high, the closer to the deceased is more entitled than the farther from him. I mean that the son is more entitled than the son's son, and the father is more entitled than the grandfather. What deviated from lineal straightness like brothers is weaker and they do not inherit except upon the lack of the stronger. It is known from that that the daughter's son is more entitled than the sister's son, and the brother's son is more entitled than both. If they are a number in one genus like sons or brothers, the division among them is equal. Their hermaphrodite is in the group of males.

It is said that Allah did that to them so «2» the dead earthly part of them perishes by fire, then He attracts after that their part which does not accept death and lifts their souls to the sky. This is an indication to burning, and it seems it was only for the great ones. Likewise, the Indians say that in man is a point by which man is man, and it is the one that is liberated upon the dissolution of the mixtures by burning and their scattering. They saw in this return that some of it is by the ray of the sun to which the spirit clings and ascends, and some of it is by the flame of fire and its lifting it. As some of them used to pray that Allah makes his path to Him on a straight line because it is the shortest of distances, and to the height there is only fire or ray. The Ghuzz Turks went to what resembles it regarding the drowned; they place his carcass on a bed on the bank and hang a rope from its leg and throw its end in the water so his spirit ascends by it for resurrection.

Then a virtuous one does not do it with that; rather a \"Vaishya\" or \"Shudra\" prefers it in hopeful virtuous times seeking a state better than what he is in upon return. That is not permissible by text for a Brahmin or \"Kshatriya\". For this reason, he who kills himself among them kills it at the times of eclipse or hires someone to drown him in the river \"Ganges\" and undertakes holding him until he dies. At the confluence of the rivers \"Jumna\" and Ganges is a great tree known as Prayaga of the genus of trees called \"Bar\" (Banyan). Its property is that two types of branches emerge from its branches: one to the top as for other trees, and the other to the bottom in the form of roots without leaves. If it enters the ground, it becomes for the branch like a pillar. That was prepared for it due to the excessive spreading of its branches.

Just as we narrated about the Indians, so \"Socrates\" said equally: It is not appropriate for anyone to kill himself before the gods cause «1» for him a compulsion and coercion like that which attends us now. He also said: That we, the assembly of people, are like those in a prison, and that it is not appropriate that we flee «2» nor that we release ourselves from it, for the gods care for us because we, the assembly of people, are servants to them.",

Then it differs according to the amount of the duration and according to the form of the act. As for the middle matter by which the condition of fasting is obtained, it is to designate the day fasted and keep in mind the name of whom he draws near to by it and fasts for his sake, of Allah or one of the angels or others. Then this doer proceeds and has his meal on the day before the day of fasting at noon, cleans the teeth by picking and miswak (tooth-stick), and intends the fast of the morrow. He refrains from that time from food. When the day of fasting breaks, he uses the miswak again, washes, establishes the obligations of his day, takes water in his hand and throws it in his directions, manifests the name of whom he fasts for with his tongue, and remains in his state until «1» the morrow of the day of fasting. When the sun rises, he has the choice in breaking the fast if he wills it at that time, and if he wills he delays it to noon. This type is called \"Upavasa\", and it is Fasting, because eating if it is from noon to noon is called \"Ekanakta\" and is not called fasting. From it is another type called \"Kricchra\", which is: To eat on a certain day at noon, and on the second day at the time of darkness (evening), and not eat on the third day except what is given to him unasked, then fast the fourth day.

From it is a type called \"Chandrayana\", which is: To fast the day of the Full Moon, and take on the day following it of food the amount of a morsel filling the mouth, and double it on the day after it, and make it on the third day three times it, until reaching the day of the Conjunction with this increase. So he fasts it, then retreats from the amount his food reached by decreasing morsel by morsel «1» until it vanishes upon reaching the Full Moon. From it is a type called \"Masavasa\" (Masopavasa?), which is: To fast continuously the days of a month consecutively, not breaking fast in them at all. Then they detail the reward of this fasting in the months upon the return after death. They say: If he continues the fast of the days of \"Chaitra\", he attains wealth and delight of the eye with noble children. If he continues \"Vaishakha\", he heads his tribe and becomes great in his army. If he continues \"Jyeshtha\", he is favored by women. If he continues \"Ashadha\", he attains ease. If he continues \"Sravana «2»\", he attains knowledge. If he continues \"Bhadrapada\", he attains health, courage, wealth, and cattle. If he continues \"Ashvina\", he remains victorious over his enemies. If he continues \"Kartika\", he becomes majestic in eyes and attains his will. If he continues \"Margashirsha\", he attains birth in the best and most fertile kingdom. If he continues \"Pausha\", he attains high lineage. If he continues \"Magha\", he obtains uncounted wealth.

    "text": "75 - On Determining the Days of Fasting\nIt must be known absolutely that the eighth and eleventh day of the white half of every month is a fast, except in the intercalary month, for it is suspended, inauspicious. The eleventh day is specific to \"Basdiv\" [Vasudeva/Krishna] because when he ruled in the city of \"Mathura\" and its people before him used to celebrate a day in the name of \"Indra\" in every month, he induced them to transfer it to the eleventh to be in his name. They did so, and Indra became angry and sent upon them rains like deluges to destroy them and their cattle with them. So \"Basdiv\" lifted a mountain with his hand and protected them with it, until the rains flowed around them not upon them, and his image was repelled (became ugly/unnatural?). So they marked that in a mountain near \"Mathura\". Therefore, this day is fasted with utmost cleanliness and its night is spent awake in the manner of obligation, even if it is not obligatory. In the book \"Vishnu Dharma\": That if the Moon is in the mansion of \"Rohini\", which is the fourth of its mansions, on the eighth day of the black half, it is a fasting day called \"Jayanti\". Charity in it is an expiation for all sins. It is known that this condition does not apply to all months, but is specific to \"Bhadrapada\" in which Basdiv was born on this day of it while the Moon was in Rohini. Due to \"Adhimasa\" and the delaying and advancing of years, the two conditions of the Moon's mansion and the day of the month do not coincide except once every few years. It was said in the mentioned book also: That if the Moon is in the mansion of \"Punarvasu «1»\", which is the seventh of the mansions, on the eleventh day of the white half...",

Acts of righteousness in it enable obtaining wills as \"Sagara\", \"Kakutstha\", and \"Dhandhumara\" were enabled by them and attained kingship when they did them. The sixth day of \"Chaitra\" is a fast in the name of the Sun. In \"Ashadha\", if the Moon is in the mansion of \"Anuradha\", which is the seventeenth of the mansions, it is a fast for Basdiv called \"Devasayani\", meaning that \"Deva\" is sleeping, because it is the first of the four months which he slept. Some of them add to the condition the being of the day the eleventh of the month. It is known that that does not happen every year. Whoever is of the sect of \"Basdiv\" avoids in them meat, fish, sweets, and approaching women, and makes his eating once every day, and makes the earth his bed without a mattress or elevation from it on a bed. It has been said regarding these four months that they are the night of the angels, excepted from its beginning a month for twilight and from its end a month for dawn. But the sun is then close to the beginning of Cancer, which is the noon of the angels, so I do not know how it connects to its two Sandhis «1». The day of the Full Moon of \"Sravana\" is a fast in the name of \"Somnath\". In \"Ashvina\", if the Moon is in Cancer and the Sun in Virgo, it is a fast.

According to them, he used to rule the whole world. This is their habit regarding most of their kings. Then they approximate his date as we mentioned, so their lying appears. Even if it is possible that an Indian takes over as a Greek, Roman, Babylonian, and Persian took over, but most of the reports close to us are as established with us. This mentioned one was the king of the land of India in its entirety, for they know no other than it nor other than its people. The eleventh day of the month is called \"Hindoli Chaitra\". They gather in it at \"Devahara Basdiv\" (Temple of Vasudeva) and swing his idol as was done with him in the swing when he was a boy. Likewise, they do in their houses all day and rejoice. The Full Moon of this month is called \"Bahand\" (Vasant?). It is a festival for women in which they adorn themselves and propose gifts to their husbands. The twenty-second day of \"Chaitra\" is called \"Chaitra-ashtami\". It is a festival and joy in the name of \"Bhagavati\". In it one bathes and gives charity. The third day of \"Vaishakha\" is a festival for women called \"Gauri-tritiya\", in the name of \"Gauri\" daughter of Mount \"Himavant\", who is the wife of \"Mahadev\".

Their lighting of them is in sixteen places, every four of them separately. A \"Brahmin\" undertakes the sacrifice in them to be four according to the number of \"Veda\". Then they return on the sixteenth day. In this month is the Vernal Equinox called \"Vasanta\". They extract it by their calculation, celebrate it, and host the Brahmins. The first day of \"Jyeshtha\", which is the day of Conjunction, they celebrate and throw the first fruits of crops into the water by way of blessing.

On the eighth day of \"Ashvina\" while the Moon is in the mansion of \"Mula\", the nineteenth of the mansions, is the beginning of sucking sugar cane.

When it is morning, they bring them to the tanks, wash them, bathe, and give charity. The sixth day of Bhadrapada is called \"Kaphashthi\" (?) in which feeding is done. The eighth day, when the light of the Moon is half in its body, is called \"Dhruva-griha\" (?). They bathe in it and eat sprouted grains so their children remain safe. Women celebrate it due to pregnancy and seeking a child. The eleventh day of Bhadrapada is called \"Parvati\". It is the name of a thread the custodian makes from what is gifted to him. He dyes a place of it with saffron and leaves another. He estimates it according to the stature of the idol of \"Basdiv\", then casts it on his neck so it hangs down to his foot. It is a magnified festival. The sixteenth day, which is the first of the Black Half, is the first of seven days called \"Karara\" (?). They adorn the boys in them and perfume them, so they play with types of animals. When it is the seventh, the men adorn themselves and celebrate it. In what remains of the month, they return to adorning the boys «1» «1» in the late parts of the day, give charity to the Brahmins, and do good.

Its water whitens in these two days, so they attribute that to the bathing of \"Mahadev\" in it. The first day of \"Kartika\", which is the day of Conjunction in the sign of Libra, is called \"Diwali «2»\". They bathe in it, adorn themselves, exchange gifts of Betel leaves and Areca nut, ride to the Devaharas (Temples) for charity, and play rejoicing until noon. In its night, they increase the lighting of lamps in every place until the air is illuminated. Its cause is that \"Lakshmi\", wife of \"Basdiv\", releases \"Bali son of Virochana «3»\", the King imprisoned in the seventh earth, every year on this day and brings him out to the world. So it is called \"Bali-rajya\", meaning the Emirate of Bali. They claim that he was in \"Krita Yuga\", the time of good, so we rejoice because our day resembles that time.

They hold a banquet in it with meats and large black pulse (Mash). The eighth day of \"Phalguna\" is called \"Purartak\" (?). They make in it for the Brahmins from flour and ghee types of foods.

The remainder is divided by 365, and what comes out is discarded. If «2» nothing remains from the division, it is the time of this festival.

So it is the first of the month of \"Chaitra\" and the time of the Vernal Equinox together. Likewise, the rest of the Yugas, each one according to the opinion of its author. Because according to \"Brahmagupta\", the civil days of Chaturyuga are 1,577,916,450, the solar months in it are 51,840,000, the months of \"Adhimasa\" 1,593,300, the days of the Moon 1,602,999,000, and the days of \"Unaratra\" 25,082,550. These are the things by which analysis and synthesis run in dates. The orbit of the matter of the Yugas according to him is on tenths, and each one of these numbers has a correct tenth. So the condition of the beginnings of the Yugas is the condition of the beginning of Chaturyuga. As for according to \"Paulisa\", the civil days of Chaturyuga are 1,577,917,800, the solar months in it 51,840,000, the months of Adhimasa 1,593,336, the days of the Moon 1,603,000,010, and the days of \"Unaratra\" 25,082,280. The orbit of the matter of the Yugas according to him is on quarters, and each one of these numbers has a correct quarter. So the beginnings of the Yugas like the beginning of \"Chaturyuga\" do not depart from the first of \"Chaitra\" and from the Vernal Equinox. They only differ in the week (day). So there is no face then for what they mention unless they take it by interpretation. The times in which reward is earned are called \"Punyakala\". \"Balabhadra\" said in his commentary on Khandakhadyaka: If a Yogi man, who is the ascetic who intellects the Creator and prefers good and refrains from evil, persisted in his conduct for thousands of years, his reward would not catch up to the reward of one who gave charity in Punyakala and established its conditions of bathing, anointing, prayer, and glorifications. Inevitably, most of the preceding festivals are of this genus, for they are for charities and banquets. Were they not hopeful, joy and rejoicing would not be approved in them. Then of Punyakala are what are auspicious along with that, and of them what are inauspicious. Among the auspicious are the transitions of the planets from Sign to Sign, especially the transition of the Sun. These times are called \"Sankranti\". Their choicest are the two Equinoxes and the two Solstices. The best of them is the Vernal Equinox, called \"Bikhuv\" (Vishuva) and \"Bishu «1»\"...",

Because these times pass with an instant of time, and making a sacrifice \"Shanti\" to the fire with oil and grains is needed in them, they made them possessors of width (duration) with a beginning for them when the eastern edge of its (Sun's) body touches the first of the Sign, and a middle when its center meets it, which is the time of transition by calculation, and an end when its western edge touches it. So from the beginning of this time to its end in the Sun became close to two hours. To know the positions of the times of the transitions of the Sun into the Signs from the week, there are methods. Among them is what \"Simha\" dictated, which is to subtract from \"Shakakala\" 847, multiply the remainder by 180, and divide the sum by 143. Days and what follows them of their minutes and seconds come out. It is the Origin. Whatever Sign the time of the Sun's transition into it is wanted in that year, what is opposite it is taken and added to the Origin, each chapter to its chapter.

That is known in the Zijes. We do not present of their works except what we find strange or know that it did not ring in the ears of our companions who do not know of their works other than what is in their Sindhind. Among those times are the two times of the solar and lunar eclipse. In them, they claimed, all the waters of the earth become pure like the purity of the water of \"Ganges\". Their magnification of them reaches such that many of them kill themselves choosing death in the virtuous time. Only \"Vaishya\" and \"Shudra\" do that. As for \"Brahmin\" and \"Kshatriya\", that is forbidden to them and they do not do it. And the times of \"Parva\", meaning those in which eclipse is possible, even if it does not occur, they are comparable to the eclipse in virtue. And the times of the Yogas are like eclipses, and they have a separate chapter. When it happens within the civil day that the Moon is in the last of its mansions and moves to the one following it and completes it and moves in it to a third so that it is in that day in three consecutive mansions, they call it \"Tryahasparsha\" and also \"Tri-harkasha\" (?). It is inauspicious; they take it as an evil omen, and it is among the whole of \"Punyakala\". Likewise is the condition in the civil day that includes a complete lunar day, its beginning on the last of the lunar day before it and its end on the beginning of the one after it. It is called \"Treyahkatata\" (?). It is inauspicious, but chosen for earning reward. When a day is completed of \"Unaratra\", which are the days of Decrease, it is inauspicious and counted among the whole of Punyakala.

According to \"Paulisa\", the fraction of the civil and lunar is 63,379, the fraction of the solar is 274, and the denominator for all of them is 69,673. As for \"Adhimasa\", the time in which its month is completed and its fraction is removed is inauspicious and not Punyakala. That is because it occurs according to Brahmagupta from the civil days in 990 and 3,663 of 10,622, from the solar days in 976 and 464 of 5,311, and from the lunar days in 1006, and the fraction and its denominator are like those for the solar.",

Just as they were called days, likewise the first half of each one was called a day for it and the last a night. Each one has a name, and their total is \"Karana\". Of those names are what come once and do not return, and they are around the Conjunction. Their number is four, and they are called \"Fixed\" from the perspective that they are not in the month except once and from the perspective that their positions do not differ by day and night. Of them are what rotate and come in the month eight times. They are called \"Moving\" because of their rotation and because each one of them comes in the day and in the night together. Their number is seven. The last of them, the seventh, is the inauspicious one (Vishti/Bhadra) by which boys are frightened and by whose name children turn gray. We have investigated their matter in other than this book. No arithmetic book of the Indians is devoid of mentioning them. If you want to know them, precede with knowing the lunar days and the position of the assumed time in them. That is to subtract the corrected Sun from the corrected Moon.

So \"Ghati\" and what follows it past of the broken day come out. This is according to what is in their Zijes.

Then they applied an analogy to it that is better organized than the subject itself in origin, so it became something else.

They made the first twelve hours for the Sun, burnt and inauspicious, then the like for Venus, then for Mercury, and so on according to the order of the spheres. Whenever the turn returned to the Sun, they called its twelve hours 'hours of Vishti' (Visti), which is 'Bhadra'. But the Indians do not measure its times by civil days but by lunar days, and they do not start with this burnt one from the Conjunction.

However, the agreed-upon ones among them are two. One is the existence of the two luminaries together on two declination circles... meaning every two circles whose declinations are in one direction are equal; this is called 'Vyatipata'. And their existence together on two equal circles, meaning every two circles whose declinations are in two different directions are equal; this is called 'Vaidhrita'. The sign of the first is the sum of the corrected positions of the two luminaries from the beginning of Aries being exactly six signs. The sign of the second is this sum being exactly twelve signs. If they are corrected for a specific time and their corrected positions added, if it is like one of the two signs, it is the time of one of them. If the sum falls short of the amount of the sign or exceeds it, the time of equality is extracted by the difference between this sum and the limit set for it, and by the sum of the daily motions of the two luminaries representing the modified daily motion, similar to the operation of the time of Conjunction and Opposition in the Zijes (Astronomical Tables). If the distance of the time from noon or midnight—whichever the correction was based on—is known, its time is called the 'Mean', because if the Moon adhered to the ecliptic as the Sun adheres to it, this time would be the required one. But it has latitude from it, so at this time it is not on the declination circle of the Sun or the circle equal to it by vision. Therefore, the positions of the two luminaries and the Node are extracted for the Mean time, and the declination of the Sun and Moon is calculated for it. If they are equal, it is...",

If its latitude was added to the declination of its degree in its calculation, subtract the latitude of the Moon from the declination of the Sun. If its latitude was subtracted from the declination of its degree, add its latitude to the declination of the Sun. Then find the arc of the result in the units of declination, and preserve this arc. It is the one used in the Zij 'Karanatilaka'. Then look at the Moon for the Mean time. If it is in the odd quadrants of the ecliptic, which are the vernal and autumnal, and its declination is less than the Sun's declination, then the time of equality of the two declinations, which is the required, is after the Mean, meaning future. If its declination is more than hers, then the time is before the Mean, meaning past. In the even quadrants, the matter is the opposite. Then 'Paulisa' adds the declinations of the two luminaries in 'Vyatipata' if their directions differ, and in 'Vaidhrita' if they agree. And he takes the difference between the declinations of the two luminaries in 'Vyatipata' if their directions agree, and in 'Vaidhrita' if they differ. This becomes the First Preserved, and it is for the Mean time. Then he places minutes of days 'Masha' (Matra?) provided it is less than a quarter of a day. He extracts for it from the daily motions of the luminaries and the Node their motions, and from them their positions according to its state from the Mean time in past and future. He calculates the Second Preserved from them. He identifies the state of past and future in it and compares it to the Mean time. If the time of equality of the two declinations is past or future in both, the difference between the two Preserved values is the divisor. If it is past in one and future in the other, the sum of the two Preserved values is the divisor. Then he multiplies the minutes of days placed in the First Preserved and divides the sum by the divisor. The minutes of distance from the Mean time come out, and it was established whether they are past or future. According to that, the time of equality of the two declinations becomes known.

If it is more than it, it is past. Then multiply the difference between the two Moons by the daily motion of the Sun and divide the sum by the daily motion of the Moon. Add what comes out to the position of the Sun at the time of correction if the Second Moon is more than the First, and subtract it from the Sun if the Second Moon is less.

Extract by them the positions of the two luminaries, the Node, and the two declinations. If they are equal, it is the required. Otherwise, repeat the operation and iterate until they are equal and the time is correct. Then extract the magnitude of the two luminaries, and cast away half their sum; half of the two magnitudes remains.

As for 'Varahamihira', he considers inauspicious their duration which calculation brings out, and likens it to the wound of a gazelle whose arrow was poisoned; for its harm does not exceed what is around it, so if the poisoned spot is cut, the harm ceases. They have multiplied the number of 'Vyatipata' by the Mansions according to what 'Paulisa' narrated from 'Parashara', and its reference is to what he mentioned, for the species did not increase by it, but its particular individuals multiplied. Bhattila the Brahmin said in his Zij: There are eight times here having standards; if the sum of the corrected positions of the two luminaries equals them, they occur. The first is 'Gandanta', and its standard is four signs (120 degrees). (The second?) and its standard is four signs and thirteen degrees and a third. The third is 'Lata', which is the absolute Vyatipata, and its standard is six signs. The fourth is 'Chapas', and its standard is six signs, six degrees, and two-thirds of a degree.",

Because they are so, no duration in minutes of falling was obtained for them, but rather unknown estimations. The duration of each of Vyakshata and Gandanta, according to what Varahamihira mentioned, is one 'Muhurta', and the duration of each of Kaladanda and Barha is two Muhurtas. Then they also lengthened and detailed without benefit, and we have recounted them in that book. It is mentioned in the Zij 'Karanatilaka': Twenty-seven Yogas. Their calculation is to add the corrected position of the Sun to the corrected position of the Moon, make the sum all minutes, and divide by eight hundred. Complete Yogas come out. Multiply the remainder by sixty and divide the sum by the sum of the daily motions of the two luminaries. Minutes of days and what follows them come out, passed from the broken Yoga.

    "text": "LXXX. On the Mention of Their Introductory Principles in Judicial Astrology and Indicating Their Origins Therein. Our companions in these lands have not known the methods of the Indians in judicial astrology, nay, they have never looked at a book of theirs regarding it. Therefore, they think they agree with them and narrate stories about them of which we found nothing among them. Just as we pointed previously to a portion of everything, likewise we point in this chapter to what would be informative and facilitate studying with them. For if we intended sufficiency in that, the matter would be long, while we intend the summaries, not the branches. Let it be known first that their reliance in most judgments is on what resembles omens and physiognomy, and reversing the obligation of inferring beings from the seconds of the stars which are the events of the atmosphere. As for the planets being seven, there is no disagreement between us and them in it. They call the wandering planets 'Graha'. Among them are benefics absolutely, which are three: Jupiter, Venus, and the Moon, and are called 'Saumya Graha'. And three malefics absolutely, called 'Krura Graha', which are Saturn, Mars, and the Sun. The Head (Node), even if not a planet, is mentioned with the malefics. And one whose states change, so it is added to who is with it, benefic or malefic, and that is Mercury; if it is alone by itself, it is a benefic. We have placed the conditions of the planets in a table: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1",

As for the months of pregnant women, it is the completion of the table. They assign the eighth month to the Ascendant of the falling of the sperm (conception). They claim that the fetus in it takes the subtleties of foods. If it completes them then is born, it lives; and if it is born before completing them, it dies due to deficiency. The ninth month belongs to the Moon and the tenth to the Sun. They do not exceed it in staying (gestation). If it happens, they claim there is an affliction in it from the wind. They look into the time of the falling of the sperm, known by reports not by extraction by calculation, at the conditions of the planets and their powers, and judge the months of their turns according to them. The matter of friendship and enmity among them is very strong, like the strength of the lordship of the House. Perhaps it transforms in time from the original nature. An example for it and its years will come later. There is no disagreement between us and them regarding the Signs being twelve and what planets follow them in Lordship.

They do not attribute the Triplicities to the elements and natures as is our custom, but they attribute them to the directions in general, and their detail is in the table.

    "text": "These are the principles upon which the axis of judicial astrology truly revolves, I mean the planets, the Signs, and the Houses. He who is capable of extracting their indications deserves the label of graduated and advanced in his craft. Following them is the division of Signs into parts. The first of them is the 'Nim-bahras' (Half-Signs), called 'Hora' by the name of the hour, because the rising of half a Sign is in close to an hour. The first half of every male Sign belongs to the malefic of the two luminaries, I mean the Sun, due to masculinity; and the last to the benefic of them, due to femininity, which is the Moon. That is reversed in the female Signs. Then the thirds, called 'Drekkana' (Decans). There is no benefit in mentioning them because they are exactly what are called among us 'Darijanat'. Then the 'Nuh-bahras' (Ninths), called 'Navamsha'. Because they are of two types in the books of introductions among us, we mention what the Indians are upon to know the inciter upon them. It is to make from the beginning of the Sign to the minute whose Navamsha is desired into total minutes and divide by two hundred. Complete ninths come out, counted from the cardinal Sign which is in the triplicity of that Sign consecutively for every ninth a Sign. The one the turn of the fraction ends at is the owner of the required Navamsha. The first ninth of every cardinal Sign, the fifth of every fixed, and the ninth of every bicorporeal is called 'Vargottama', meaning the greatest of shares. Then the Twelfths, called 'Dvadasamsa'. Knowing it for the assumed place of the Sign is to make from its beginning to it into total minutes and divide the sum by one hundred and fifty. Complete half-sixths (twelfths) come out, counted from that Sign consecutively for every one a Sign. The one the fraction ends at, its lord is the lord of the twelfth of that place. After that are the Degrees, called 'Trimsamsa', meaning the thirty degrees, standing as the Terms (Hudud) among us. Their system is that Mars has five degrees from the beginning of every male Sign, then Saturn the like of it, Jupiter eight, Mercury seven, and Venus five.

The condition of every Sign regarding the Aspect (Drishti) is the condition of the Ascendant that «1» rises above the horizon «1». Its law is that the Sign does not look at the two [signs] on its sides (2nd and 12th). Every two Signs between whose beginnings is a quarter of the sphere, or its third, or its half, correspond (aspect) each other. If there is a sixth of it between them, the aspect is only in the sequence of the Signs. If there is the sum of its quarter and its sixth between them, the aspect is only contrary to the sequence of the Signs. The aspect has ranks: That which is between a Sign and its fourth «2» or between it and its eleventh is a quarter aspect. That which is between it and its fifth or ninth is half an aspect. That which is between it and its sixth or tenth is three-quarters of an aspect. That which is between it and its seventh is a full aspect. They do not mention the aspect regarding two planets present in one Sign. As for the transformation of friendship and enmity, it is among their principles that if a planet happens to be in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, the Sign itself, second, third, or fourth [from another planet], it moves from its state with it to a better one. If it was among its enemies, it becomes intermediate (neutral); if it was among the intermediate, it becomes a friend; and if it was among friends, it becomes a closer friend. As for in the other Signs, it moves from its state with it to a worse one. If it was a friend, it becomes intermediate; if intermediate, it becomes an enemy; and if an enemy, it becomes a bitter enemy. This is an accidental state in the moment, folded over the original one. Since this is established, we mention the four strengths that belong to a planet. The first of them is the Positional, called \"Sthana-bala\". Its attainment for a planet is by its being in its exaltation, its house (Mul-trikona), the house of its friend, or the \"Navabhaga\" (Navamsa) of its house, or its exaltation, or its \"Mulatrikona\", meaning its joy in «3» the line of benefics. The Sun and Moon are distinguished in it by being in the benefic Signs, just as the wandering planets are distinguished in it by being in the malefic Signs.

It is obtained for the planet by being in the Angle (Kendra) in which it is strong. Some of the people add to that the two houses adjacent to the Angle. It is obtained for the Ascendant by day if it is bipedal, and by night if it is quadrupedal; and at the two times of \"Sandhi\" (twilight) for the rest of the Signs. This is what pertains to Nativities. As for in Questions (Horary Astrology), they claim that this strength is obtained for the tenth [house] if it is quadrupedal, for the seventh if it is Scorpio or Cancer, and for the fourth if it is Aquarius or Cancer. As for the third strength, it is the Motional (or Victorious) called \"Chesta-bala\". It is obtained for the planet by retrograding and by emerging from invisibility (combustion) up to a limit of four Signs of visibility, and its declination to the North, except for Venus, for the South is for it like the North for others. The two luminaries are distinguished in it by being in the ascending half approaching the Summer Solstice, and the Moon specifically by being with the planets other than the Sun, so it prepares for it from them. This strength is obtained for the Ascendant by its lord being in it, if we look at the aspect of Jupiter and Mercury to it, and its freedom from the aspect of malefics and their presence in it except its lord; for the presence of a malefic in it weakens the aspect of Jupiter and Mercury to it until their utility «1» in this strength is nullified. As for the fourth strength, it is \"Kala-bala\", meaning the Temporal. It is obtained for diurnal planets by day and nocturnal ones by night, and for Mercury in its Sandhi (twilight)—and some of them claim that it has this strength perpetually because it is attributed to the day and night together. It is also obtained for benefics in the white half of the month (Waxing) and for malefics in the black (Waning). It belongs to the Ascendant always. Some of them add to the citation: because it is one of the four times of years, months, days, and hours. These are the strengths extracted for the planets and the Ascendant. Preference belongs to the one whose number of them is greater. If two are equal in the number of \"Bala\", the one who has «2» precedence in magnitude is prioritized.

We have placed the magnitudes of the first and second types in the table. \"Shadaya\" and \"Bisharkah Qaqa\" (?) [act as] the degree of exaltation. As for the first, it is extracted if the mentioned strengths of the Sun exceed the strengths of each of the Moon and the Ascendant. As for the second, it is if the strengths «2» of the Moon exceed the strengths of each of the Sun and the Ascendant. The third type is called \"Amshaya\" (Amsayu); it is extracted when the strengths of the Ascendant exceed their strengths. As for extracting the years of the first type for every planet, if it is not at the degree of its exaltation, its distance from it is taken if it is more than six signs, and the completion of this distance to twelve signs if it is less than six signs. Then it is multiplied by its years placed in the table. So, months gather from signs, days from degrees, and minutes of days from minutes. They are raised to what they are raised to: every sixty minutes a day, every thirty days a month, and every twelve months a year. Its extraction for the Ascendant is that for every sign of the distance of its degree from the beginning of Aries, a year is taken, for every two and a half degrees a month, for every five minutes a day «4», and for every five seconds a minute of a day. As for extracting the years of the second type for the planets, it is that its distance from the degree of exaltation is taken with the condition that preceded, and multiplied by its years which are in the table, and done with what gathered as preceded. The Ascendant is taken from the distance of its degree from the beginning of Aries: for every \"Navabhaga\" (Navamsa) a year, and the months and what follows them according to that calculation. Then what resulted of years is cast twelve by twelve, and what remains not exceeding twelve is the years of the Ascendant.

The name \"Ayurdaya\" encompasses all these years. Before the equation, they are called \"Madhyamaya\", and after it \"Sphutaya\", meaning corrected. As for the years of the Ascendant in all types, they are corrected and do not need equation by the two types of reduction: one according to the place in the Ether «5» (Zodiac) and the other according to the position from the Horizon. The third type is distinguished by the equation of increase in one manner, which is that if the planet is in its greatest portion (Exaltation?), or in its house, or the \"Drekkana\" of its house, or the Drekkana of its exaltation, or the Navabhaga of its house, or the Navabhaga of its exaltation, or in most of that, its years become double the mean. If it is retrograde or in most of that, its years become double the mean. If it is retrograde or in its exaltation or both, the years become three times the mean.

If an increase and a reduction gather for it, present one of them and follow with the other «1», for it does not differ. So the years become equated, and their sum is the life span of the owner of the nativity. It remains now to explain their method in turns (periods/Dasha). The life span is divided over these years. The beginning is from birth with the years of the two luminaries. The prioritized of them is the one with more strength and effect; if they are equal, then the one with more luck in its position, then the other follows. Following them is either the Ascendant or the planet being in the Angles (Kendras) with the abundance of strengths and portions. If several planets gather in the Angles, prioritize them according to their strengths and shares «2».

If several planets gather in one place, each one shares the fraction which the place necessitated. The method of extracting the years of partnership is to place for the owner of the years a one for the numerator and the like of it for the denominator because he takes over the whole. Then place for every partner the fraction of its denominator. Multiply every denominator of them by all the numerators and its quotient except itself and its numerator.

Their method in extracting the life span is known from what we mentioned. The quality of the state of division is known from the positions of the planets in the Origin and in the Time. Let us follow it regarding the matter of nativities with what others do not busy themselves with. That is that they look for the father at the time of birth, was he present? They infer his absence by the Moon not aspecting the Ascendant, or the sign of the Moon being confined between the signs of Venus and Mercury, or Saturn being in the Ascendant or Mars in the seventh. They look whether the newborn is legitimate. If the two luminaries gather in a sign and with them is a malefic, or the Moon and Jupiter fall from aspecting the Ascendant, or Jupiter falls from aspecting the gathered luminaries, he is illegitimate. They look into the matter of the lamp at the sign of the Sun. If it is movable (Cardinal), the lamp was moving, transferred from one place to another. If fixed, then fixed. If it was double-bodied (Mutable), it was moving once and resting another. They look at the ratio of the degrees of the Ascendant to thirty; according to it is the burnt part of the wick. If the Moon is full, the lamp was full of oil; then it is in it according to the amount of light in the body of the Moon. They infer the door of the house by the strongest planet in the Angles, for its direction is to its direction, or the direction of the sign of the Ascendant if the Angles are empty. They look at the planet in the house «2». If it is the Sun, the house is dilapidated; the Moon, sound; Mars, burnt; Mercury, arched; Jupiter, strong; and Saturn, old. Then if Jupiter is in its exaltation in the tenth, the house has two legs (pillars) or three. If its testimony is strong in Sagittarius, it has three; and in the other double-bodied signs, it has two legs. They look for the bed/couch and its legs (the third house) and its squares «3» and its length from the twelfth to the third.

If Jupiter is in his exaltation in the sixth or the eighth or one of the Angles, or the Ascendant is Pisces and Jupiter is in his exaltation in it, and the figures of the time of death agree with the figures of the time of birth, the soul is liberated and does not return. I only narrated this so that the contrast of the methods of our people and the methods of the Indians in astrological judgments is known. As for their methods in atmospheric and worldly events, despite their length, they are very weak. Just as we restricted ourselves regarding the matter of nativities to mentioning life spans, likewise we restrict ourselves regarding this art to the type of comets from the saying of the one among them thought to have superior attainment, so what is beyond it may be measured by it. We say that the name of the Head of the Dragon (Node) is \"Rahu\" and the name of its Tail is \"Ketu\". The Indians rarely mention the Tail; they only use the Head alone. All tailed stars (comets) occurring in the atmosphere are also called \"Ketu\" generally. \"Varahamihira\" said: The Head has thirty-three sons called \"Tamas-kilaka\". They are types of comets, whether they extend (have a tail) or do not extend. The judgment on them...",

The worst of them is the one formed in the image of a crow, the one formed in the image of a beheaded man, and the one in the image of a sword, dagger, bow, and arrow. They are always around the luminaries, agitating the waters until they become turbid, stirring the atmosphere until it reddens, and shaking it until its storms uproot great trees and strike the legs and knees of people with pebbles. They shift the natures of time until the seasons of the year move from their places. So whenever misfortunes and evils multiply, such as earthquakes, crashes, inflammation of heat, redness of the sky, frequency of the noise of wild beasts and the screaming of birds, know that that is from the sons of the Head. If those conditions appear with an eclipse or the emergence of a comet, be certain of what you perceived, and do not occupy yourself in inferring by other than the sons of the Head. Point in the place of evil to their direction from the body of the Sun in the eight directions. \"Varahamihira\" said in the book \"Samhita\": I did not speak on comets except after exhausting what is in the books of \"Garga\", \"Parashara\", \"Asita\", \"Devala\", and what is in other books despite their multitude. Recognizing their calculation is impossible unless knowledge precedes the time of their appearance and disappearance, because they are not one type but many. Among them are the high ones distant from the earth which appear between the stars of the lunar mansions and are called «1» \"Divya\". Among them are the intermediate in distance which are between the heaven and the earth and are called \"Antariksha\". Among them are those close to the earth which fall on it and on mountains, houses, and trees. Perhaps a light is seen falling on the earth and it is thought to be fire; if it is not fire, it is \"Ketu Rupa\", meaning «2» in the form of a comet. As for the animals which if they fly in the air are like sparks or fires remaining in the houses of \"Pishacha\" (devils) and demons, or other shinings of jewels and others, they are not of the genus of comets. Therefore, knowledge of their quiddity must precede judging upon them, for the judgment is according to them. That which is in the air falls on banners, weapons, houses, trees...",

Some of them said it is one hundred and one, and some of them said it is a thousand. \"Narada\" the Sage said: It is one, but it differs by the multitude of forms; it sheds one and wears another. He said regarding the duration of their influence: It is months like the number of days of their appearance «2». If it exceeds a month and a half, subtract from it forty-five days; the remainder is the months of its influence. If it exceeds two months, make the years of its influence according to the number of the months of its appearance. The number of comets does not exceed «3» a thousand. He presented what we deposited in this table to facilitate contemplation, even if the cells of the table are not filled due to the deficiency «4» of what is in the book regarding the sections, either the original or the copy that fell to us.

He also mentioned from the high and intermediate section what is in our table, each one separately. He mentioned that the intermediate, if its light connects to the instruments of kings such as banners, parasols, fans, and fly-whisks, indicates the destruction of the rulers. If it connects to a house, tree, or mountain, it indicates the corruption of the kingdom. If it connects to the furniture of the house, its people perish. If it connects to the sweepings of the house, its owner perishes. He said: If a meteor swoops down obstructing the tail of the comet, safety ceases, and rains and trees attributed to \"Mahadev\" are corrupted—and there is no benefit in enumerating them because they are unfamiliar in name and body to us—and conditions are disturbed in the kingdom of \"Gaur\" [Gauda/Bengal], \"Sata\" (Sita?), \"Huna\" [Huns], and \"China\" [China]. He said: Look at the direction of the comet's tail, whether it hangs down, stands up, or inclines, and to the Mansion (Nakshatra) whose tip it touches. Judge corruption there and the attack of armies on its people «1», swallowing them as the peacock swallows snakes. Exclude from them what is indicative of good. Then contemplate in the remaining ones the Mansion in which their tails appear or which they occupy or reach. Judge corruption in the kings of the regions which the Mansions indicate and the rest of the things which are attributed «2» to them «3», and which the people of the Torah describe with our description of the Kaaba (Orientation/Qibla?).

    "text": "This is their method regarding comets and judging upon them. Few of them occupy themselves with verification like the occupation of the naturalists among the Greeks in researching them and the quiddity of celestial effects, for they are not free in them from the speech of the establishers of their creed. It was mentioned in \"Matsya Purana\" that rains are four and mountains are four, and their origin is water. And that the earth is set up on four elephants in the four directions, lifting water with their trunks to purify the crops, spraying them as rains in summer and snows in winter. And that smoke is the servant of rain; it rises to it and adorns the cloud with blackness. Because of the four elephants, it was said in the book of Elephant Medicine (Hastyayurveda) that among their males is what people advance as a trick so it is taken as an evil omen; it is a blaze in the herd (distinctive?), called \"Manqana\" (?). Among them is what presents one tusk, then there are among them those with three and four tusks, and they are of the offspring of the bearers of the earth. They are not interfered with, and if they fall into a trap, they are released. It was mentioned in \"Vayu Purana\": That wind and ray lift water from the sea to the Sun. If the dripping were from it, the rain would be hot, but it pushes it to the Moon so it drips from it and the world is revived by it. It was said regarding atmospheric events that thunder is the voice of \"Airavata\", which is the mount of \"Indra\" the Chief among elephants, when it drinks from the pond \"Manasa\" and becomes rutting and roars. And that the rainbow is the bow of this Chief, just as our commoners attribute it to Rustam «1». We see in what we have narrated sufficiency for him who wants to interact with the Indians and address them in demands with the reality of what they are upon. Let us cut the speech which has become boring by its length and breadth. We ask Allah for forgiveness in the narrations except for the truth, and we ask Him for support to hold fast to what pleases Him, and we ask Him for guidance to recognize falsehood to avoid it. Indeed, good is from Him, and He is Compassionate to His servants. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and His blessings be upon the Prophet Muhammad and all his family.",
