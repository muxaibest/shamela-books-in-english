    "text": "Investigation Introduction. Praise be to Allah who guided to His obedience and inspired, and taught man what he did not know. I ask Him for gratitude for what He has bestowed and favored, and for a good outcome by which He completes His blessings and concludes. Peace and blessings be upon Muhammad His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and upon his family. To proceed... Here is a work among the works of one of the scholars of the ninth Hijri century in the science of Hadith Terminology. Its author mentioned in its opening that he collected its material from several books he listed; however, upon investigation, we find that his book is considered an abridgment of the book \"Al-Khulasah fi Ma'rifat al-Hadith\" by Sharaf al-Din al-Tibi (died 743 AH). Yes, he quoted others, but the majority of his book is summarized from the book of Al-Tibi, may Allah have mercy on him. The book is brief and concise, suitable as a text (Matn) in terminology. The author said in his preface: \"These chapters are the texts of the fundamentals, and summaries of books on Hadith sciences. I wrote them in a concise manner so they are easy to recall, for this art has become strange.\" He said in his introduction: \"This is a summary containing the minimum that is indispensable for a student of Hadith, indeed for every student of any type of legal sciences regarding the knowledge of Hadith sciences. I wrote it when I arrived in the city of Nishapur, at the suggestion of a group of scholars, refined, clarified, summarized, and purified from the books of the great Hafiz scholars and the Imams of the regions and reports.\" As for the author, he died in the first half of the ninth century, and information about him is scarce. I did not find anyone who mentioned him except later scholars like Ismail Pasha al-Baghdadi and Haji Khalifa. Did one of the scholars whose heritage has not yet been printed write a biography for him? Or is his case like...",

    "text": "...some authors about whom only a little has been transmitted to us that does not satisfy?! Perhaps what has not been printed of our ancestors' books will unveil and answer many questions of this kind. I investigated his treatise based on two manuscripts, close in time to the author. My plan was as follows: I transcribed the text from Copy (A) and reconciled it with the two copies. I attributed the quotes in the treatise to their sources. I referenced the Hadiths, clarifying their ruling regarding authenticity and weakness. And I created an index for the sources. In conclusion... whatever success there is, it is purely a favor from Him, Glory be to Him, and whatever error there is, mistakes are a trait of humans. Sufficient for me is the saying of the first one: \"I do not absolve myself, for I am human... I forget and err as long as fate does not protect me. And you see no excuse more fitting for one who errs... than to say, admitting: Indeed, I am human.\" And our final prayer is that praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and may Allah bless and grant peace to Muhammad, his family, and his companions.

All of it is Haram, one of the greatest major sins, and the ugliest of ugly deeds by the consensus of Muslims who are counted in consensus, contrary to the Karramiyyah, the innovated sect, in their false claim that it is permissible to fabricate Hadith in encouragement and warning. Many ignorant people who attribute themselves to asceticism followed them in this [or ignorant people like them attribute them] (3). The doubt for their false claim is that it came in a narration \"Whoever lies about me intentionally to mislead thereby let him take his seat in the Fire.\" Some of them claimed that (8/A) this is lying for him [not lying about him. This which they adopted, did, and used as evidence] (4) is the height of ignorance and the end of negligence, and the greatest proof of their distance from knowing anything of the rules of Sharia. They have collected in it sets of fallacies befitting...",

If one looks into their saying, he finds a lie against Allah Almighty due to His saying: \"Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination.

This is ignorance from them of the Arabic language and the address of the Sharia, for all of that [according to them] (3) is lying about him. As for the [Hadith] (4) which they clung to, the scholars answered it with answers, the best and briefest of which are: First: That the saying: \"to mislead (8/B) people\" is a false addition. The Hafiz scholars agreed on invalidating it, and that it is not known to be authentic in any way. Second: The answer of Abu Ja'far al-Tahawi, may Allah have mercy on him, that if it were authentic, it would be for emphasis, like His Almighty saying \"And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah a lie to mislead the people.\" Third: That the Lam in: \"Li-yudilla\" (to mislead) is not the Lam of reasoning, but rather the Lam of consequence and outcome...",

So if it is seen that Hammad narrated it and was not followed up on it, then one looks: did a trustworthy narrator other than Ayyub narrate it from Ibn Sirin? If that is not found, then a trustworthy narrator other than Ibn Sirin narrated it from Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him? Otherwise, a Companion other than Abu Hurairah narrated it from the Prophet, peace be upon him? So whichever of that is found, it is known by it that the Hadith has a basis; otherwise, no. The Mutaba'ah (Follow-up): Is that someone other than Hammad narrates it from Ayyub. This is the Complete Follow-up. Or someone other than Ayyub from Ibn Sirin. Or someone other than Ibn Sirin from Abu Hurairah. Or someone other than Abu Hurairah from the Prophet, peace be upon him. All this is called Incomplete Follow-up due to its distance.

Some people of Hadith introduced into it what is not of it due to the hiddenness of its meaning.

It is known in Fiqh and its principles that all of that is called Mursal, and Al-Khatib decided this. He said: Except that most of what is described as Irsal in terms of usage is the narration of the Tabi'i from the Prophet, peace be upon him. Even if a junior Tabi'i like Al-Zuhri, for example, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said; and we held the view of Al-Hakim, the famous view is that it is Mursal like the senior Tabi'i. Ibn Abd al-Barr recounted: That a people call it Munqati' not Mursal, because most of their narration is from the Tabi'i. Branch: It was said Mursal is used as proof absolutely, and a group rejected it absolutely. The priority is that if its exit is valid by its coming from another way as Musnad without the men of the first, then it is a proof. The masses of scholars and Muhaddithin are upon this. Therefore, Al-Shafi'i, may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, used the Mursals of Ibn al-Musayyib as proof when Musnads were found from other ways.

    "text": "Second: Integrity is known by the explicit designation of two just witnesses or by widespread fame (Istifadah). His precision is known by comparing his narrations with the narrations of trustworthy narrators (Thiqat); if he agrees with them, he is precise, but if he frequently opposes them, we know his precision is flawed, and his hadith is not used as evidence. General endorsement (Ta'dil) is accepted without mentioning the reason according to the correct view, while criticism (Jarh) is not accepted unless it is explained. Criticism and endorsement regarding narrators are established by the statement of one person according to the correct view, though it is said: two are required, like testimony. If criticism and endorsement coincide regarding a person, criticism takes precedence. Third: The narration of one known for carelessness in hearing or conveying hadith is not accepted, such as one who sleeps during the hearing, or is distracted from it, or narrates not from a corrected original, or one known to accept prompting (Talqin) in hadith without [referencing] books or memory, or for frequent absent-mindedness if he does not narrate from a correct original, or one whose narrations contain many anomalies (Shadh) and rejected reports (Munkar). (17/a) Ahmad and others said: Whoever's mistake is pointed out but does not retract it and persists in it, his narration falls. The narration of one whose state is unknown (Majhul al-Hal) outwardly and inwardly is not accepted. The chosen view is accepting the narration of one whose integrity is unknown inwardly but not outwardly, and this is the 'Mastur' (veiled). The narration of one who is unknown in person (Majhul al-Ain) is not accepted, which is anyone whom the scholars do not know, and whose hadith is not known except through a single narrator. Fourth: The narration of an innovator who becomes a disbeliever due to his innovation is not accepted by consensus. Regarding the innovator whose innovation does not reach disbelief, there are three opinions: It is said: Not accepted absolutely. It is said: If he does not deem lying permissible to support his people and sect, he is accepted; but if he deems it permissible, like the Khattabiyyah, he is not accepted.",

Most of the early Hadith scholars call it 'Presentation' ('Ard), because the reader presents it to the Sheikh, whether he reads it himself or another reads while he hears, and whether he reads from a book or from his memory, and whether the Sheikh has memorized it or not, provided he holds his original copy, or a trustworthy person holds it. It is a valid narration by consensus, contrary to some who are not counted. [They differed on whether reading to the Sheikh is equal to hearing from his wording in merit, or above it, or below it?

It is narrated from Malik, his companions, and his teachers from the scholars of Medina that they are equal, and this is the school of most scholars of Hijaz and Kufa, and Al-Bukhari] (3). If the listener narrates via this method, he has several expressions. The most cautious is to say: 'I read to So-and-so', or 'It was read to him while I was listening and he acknowledged it.'

This is the school of Al-Shafi'i and his companions, Muslim, and the majority of the people of the East, and it is the common prevalent practice now. The Third Method: Abstract License (Al-Ijazah Al-Mujarradah). It has types: First: The highest of them, [a license from a specific person to a specific person, such as: 'I license you Sahih Al-Bukhari' for example] (1). The correct view according to the majority of scholars of Hadith and Fiqh is the permissibility of narrating and the [obligation] (2) of acting upon it. Second: A license from a specific person for a non-specific thing, like saying: 'I license you my heard materials or my narrations.' The majority hold the permissibility of narration by it and the obligation of action. Third: General license, like saying: 'I license the Muslims', or 'those who caught my time.' Al-Khatib permitted it absolutely. Fourth: License to an unknown person, or for an unknown thing. This is an invalid license (19/b) with no benefit. Fifth: Suspended license, such as: 'I license whomever So-and-so wills', or 'If Zayd wills the licensing of someone, I license him.' The apparent view is that it is not valid. Qadi Abu al-Tayyib gave a fatwa to this effect. Abu Ya'la Ibn al-Farra al-Hanbali and Ibn Amrus al-Maliki said: It is valid. Sixth: License to a non-existent person, like saying: 'I license whoever is born to So-and-so.' There is a disagreement regarding it. Al-Khatib permitted it and narrated it from Ibn al-Farra and Ibn Amrus. Qadi Abu al-Tayyib and Ibn al-Sabbagh invalidated it, and that is the correct view.",

    "text": "Seventh: License for what the licensor has not borne (received) yet, for the licensee to narrate it when the licensor bears it. Some late scholars considered it weak, and some forbade it, which is the correct view. Eighth: License of the licensee, such as saying: 'I license to you what I have been licensed.' The correct view is its permissibility; Al-Daraqutni, Abu Nu'aym, and Abu al-Fath al-Maqdisi affirmed it decisively. Branch: License is only considered good if the licensor is knowledgeable about what he licenses, and the licensee is a person of knowledge; because it is an expansion needed by people of knowledge. (20/a) Some made this a condition, and it was narrated from Malik. Ibn Abd al-Barr said (1): 'The correct view is that it is not permissible except for one skilled in the craft, and regarding a specific thing whose chain is not obscure.' The Fourth Method: Munawalah (Handing over). It is of two types: One: Coupled with License, which is the highest type of License. The Second: Bare of License, which is handing him a book and saying: 'This is my hearing,' limiting it to that. The correct view is that it is not permissible for him to narrate by it. This was stated by the Jurists and the Usulis, and they criticized the Hadith scholars who permitted it. Branch: Al-Zuhri and Malik permitted the unrestricted use of 'Haddathana' and 'Akhbarana' in Munawalah. This is befitting the school of those who consider the purpose of Munawalah coupled with License to be [equivalent to] hearing.",

    "text": "It is reported from Abu Nu'aym al-Asbahani, Al-Marzubani and others regarding its permissibility in License bare of Munawalah. The correct view held by the majority and the investigators is preventing that, and restricting it to a phrase that indicates license, such as 'Haddathana Ijazatan' (He narrated to us by license), (20/b) or 'Munawalatan' (by handing over), or 'Idhnan' (by permission), or 'Ajazani' (He licensed me), or 'Nawalani' (He handed me), and similar phrases. A group of late scholars agreed on using 'Anba'ana' for License; a group chose this, and Al-Bayhaqi inclined towards it. The Fifth Method: Correspondence (Mukatabah): It is writing his heard material for an absent or present person in his handwriting, or authorizing its writing. It is also of two types: Coupled with License, and bare of it. The one coupled with License is like Munawalah coupled with it in validity and strength. As for the bare one, many early and late scholars permitted it. The expression for it is: 'Kataba ilayya fulan' (So-and-so wrote to me), or 'Akhbarani fulan kitabatan' (So-and-so informed me by writing). The Sixth Method: Notification (I'lam). It is when the Sheikh informs the student that this book is his narration or hearing, limiting it to that. Many scholars of Hadith, Usul, and Fiqh permitted narration by it. The Seventh Method: Bequest (Wasiyyah). It is when a narrator, upon his death or travel, bequeaths a book he narrates to a person. Some of the Salaf permitted the legatee to narrate that from the testator like I'lam. (21/a) The correct and right view is that it is not permissible. The Eighth Method: Finding (Wijadah): It is finding a book in the handwriting of a person containing hadiths narrated by that person, which the finder did not hear from him, nor does he have a license from him or the like. He may say: 'I found in the handwriting of So-and-so' and similar phrases. Branch: If he finds a hadith in a person's compilation but not in his handwriting, he may say: 'So-and-so said' or 'So-and-so mentioned'.",

I have written something about it at the beginning of the book. There remain chapters: First: Discussion on Correction (Tashih), Indication of Weakness (Tamrid), and Tadbib (Marking). This is the concern of the [meticulous ones] (2). Tashih: is writing 'Sahh' (Correct) over speech that is correct in narration and meaning but is prone to doubt or disagreement. Tadbib: sometimes also called Tamrid, is extending a line starting like the head of the letter 'Sad' over something established in transmission but corrupt in wording or meaning, or weak, or incomplete. Among the incomplete is the place of Irsal (omission of the companion) or Inqita' (disconnection). Perhaps some of them limited the correction mark to (21/b) the 'Sad', so it resembled the 'Dabbah'. Second: It became dominant among Hadith scribes to limit 'Haddathana' and 'Akhbarana' to symbols, and it became so common that it is not hidden. They write for 'Haddathana': 'Athna', or 'Na', or 'Dana'. And for 'Akhbarana': 'Abna', or 'Ana', or 'Rana'. If a hadith has two or more chains, they write 'Ha' (H) when switching from one chain to another. They said: We have received no explanation of its matter from those who preceded, but some Huffaz wrote 'Sahh' in one place, indicating it is his symbol. It is said: It stands for 'Tahwil' (Transition) from one chain to another. It is said: It is from 'Haylulah' (Intervention) because it intervenes between the two chains. It is not part of the hadith, so nothing is pronounced in its place. It is said: It is a reference to our saying 'Al-Hadith'.",

He should write above the line of naming the names of those who heard with him and the date of hearing. If he likes, he writes that in the margin of the first sheet of the book; this is what the Sheikhs did. There is no harm in writing it at the end of the book, where it is not hidden. The writing of the hearing class (Tabaqat al-Sama') should be in the handwriting of a trustworthy Sheikh with known handwriting. There is no harm then if the [narrating] Sheikh does not certify it. And there is no harm if he writes his hearing in his own handwriting if he is trustworthy. Fourth: He should place a circle between every two hadiths. Al-Khatib recommended it to be empty, i.e., without a mark, so when he collates, he dots its center. The Fourth Type: On the manner of narrating Hadith (1). A group became strict in narration and went to extremes, while others were lenient and negligent. Some strict ones said: There is no proof except in what one narrates from memory. This was narrated from Abu Hanifa, may Allah be pleased with him, Malik, and Al-Saydalani, may Allah have mercy on them. Some said: It is permissible from his book unless it left his possession. Some lenient ones said: Narration is permissible from copies not collated with their originals. Al-Hakim made them (22/b) disparaged (Majruhin). This is frequent and was undertaken by a group of great scholars and righteous men. The correct view is what the majority holds, which is the middle path between excess and negligence.

He should not recite the hadith in a rush such that some cannot understand. He should open and close his gathering with praise of Allah and prayers upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and a supplication befitting the situation.

They write 'Sami'a' (He heard) for a five-year-old, and for one younger: 'Hadara' (He attended) or 'Uhdira' (He was brought). He should begin by hearing from the Sheikhs of his city who have the weightiest Isnad and knowledge. He should pay the Zakat of Hadith. He should honor his Sheikh. If he gains a benefit, he should guide other students to it; for concealing that is meanness. Shyness and pride should not prevent him from taking from one who is below him (24/a) in age, lineage, or status. He should be patient with his Sheikh's harshness. He should attend to the important matters, prioritizing the Sahihain (Bukhari and Muslim), then the rest of the Imams' books, like the Sunan of Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah, then the Great Sunan of Al-Bayhaqi, for we know nothing like it in its field. Then the Masanid, like the Musnad of Ahmad bin Hanbal and others. Then from the books of Ilal (Defects): his book, and the book of Al-Daraqutni. From the Histories: [Histories] (1) of Al-Bukhari and Ibn Abi Khaythama. From the books of Jarh and Ta'dil: the book of Ibn Abi Hatim. From the problematic names: the book of Ibn Makula. He should attend to books of Gharib (strange) Hadith and its commentaries. Whenever he encounters a difficulty, he searches for it and masters it, then memorizes and writes it. He should memorize hadith little by little, and occupy himself with Takhrij (extraction) and Tasnif (authorship) if he is qualified, attending to its explanation, clarifying its difficulties, and perfecting it. Rarely does one become skilled in the science of Hadith who does not do this. The scholars of Hadith have two methods in classifying it: The better of them is by Chapters (Abwab), as Al-Bukhari and Muslim did, mentioning in every chapter what he has regarding it. The second is by Munsads (24/b) [collecting] (2) in the biography of every Companion what he has of his hadith, sound and weak. In this method, it is arranged alphabetically, or by tribes, putting Banu Hashim first, then the closer and the closer. Or it may be arranged by precedence, putting the Ten [Promised Paradise] first, then the people of Badr, then Hudaybiyyah, then those who migrated between it and the Conquest, then the younger Companions, then the women, starting with the Mothers of the Believers, may Allah be pleased with them.",

Ibn al-Athir compiled a good comprehensive book on this, in which he was precise and excellent. It contains chapters: First: There is a difference regarding the definition of a Sahabi (Companion). The known definition among Hadith scholars and some Usulis is: Everyone who saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) while being a Muslim. Al-Bukhari stated this in his Sahih. (25/a) Al-Khatib (2) attributed to Ahmad bin Hanbal that he said regarding the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Whoever accompanied him for a year, a month, a day, or an hour, or saw him, is among his Companions. According to some Usulis: It is one whose sitting with him was prolonged in the manner of following and taking from him.

This is a majestic art; ignorance of it is ugly for people of knowledge, especially people of Hadith. Whoever does not know it, his mistakes multiply. It is what corresponds in writing, i.e., its form is the same, but differs in pronunciation. Like: Sallâm, all are emphasized (with Shaddah) except five: the father of Abdullah bin Salam the Companion, Muhammad bin Salam the Sheikh of Al-Bukhari, Salam bin Muhammad Al-Maqdisi, Salam the grandfather of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab bin Salam Al-Jubba'i the Mu'tazilite, and Salam bin Abi al-Huqayq. The Eighth Type: The Agreed and Separated (Al-Muttafiq wa Al-Muftariq) (2). It is what agrees in writing and pronunciation but the named persons are different. Al-Khatib has a book on it. Like Al-Khalil bin Ahmad; there are six, the first of whom is the teacher of Sibawayh. The Ninth Type: What is composed of the two types. It is when their names agree and correspond, but the names of their fathers or lineages differ, or vice versa. Al-Khatib has a good book on it, (26/b) he named it: 'Talkhis al-Mutashabih fi al-Rasm'. Like: Musa bin 'Ali, with Fatha on the 'Ayn, there are many. And Musa bin 'Ulay, with Damma on the 'Ayn. And Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Mukharrimi, with Damma on the Mim, Fatha on the Kha, and Kasra on the emphasized Ra; a famous Muhaddith attributed to Al-Mukharram in Baghdad. And Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Makhrami, with Fatha on the Mim, Sukun on the Kha, and light (non-emphasized) Fatha on the Ra; he narrated from Al-Shafi'i.",

    "text": "Conclusion. The weak servant, lover of Hadith and its people, may Allah forgive him, says: These chapters are the texts of the principles and the summaries of the books of Hadith sciences. I wrote them with brevity to facilitate their recall, for this art has become strange. I read to our Sheikh, the Imam, the Allamah, our Master Husam al-Din Muhammad bin the Ascetic Sheikh Jalal al-Ubaydi, in the beginning of the book 'Ulum al-Hadith' by Al-Hakim Abu Abdullah Al-Naysaburi, may Allah have mercy on him, (29/b) Al-Hakim said (1): 'When I saw that innovations in our time had multiplied, and people's knowledge of the principles of Sunan had decreased, despite their persistence in writing reports and their great pursuit of them with neglect and heedlessness, this called me to compile a light book containing the mention of types of Hadith sciences.' I say: If Al-Hakim said this statement in his time, then what should we say in this time? For neither a trace nor a name of the science of Hadith principles remains, nor are ears struck by any of this in schools. You are aware of the truth of this speech, although this science deserves to be prioritized over all Sharia sciences; for all of them need it. It is established that attaining eternal happiness and everlasting perfections is by following the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that is only facilitated after knowing his actions, words, and approvals, which are the second evidence of Islamic sciences, the material of principles and rulings, and following the speech of Allah, the King, the All-Knowing. It is among the best sciences in benefit and the noblest in return. No one desires its spread (30/a) except every pious person, and no one abstains from supporting it except every wretched hypocrite. If you see a man abstaining from hearing Hadith and its narration, know that he has a sign of heresy (Ilhad).",
