    "text": "**Dayr Darmalis (Monastery of Darmalis)**\nThis monastery is in the Raqqa of Bab al-Shamasiyah in Baghdad, near the house built by the Daylamite Ahmad bin Buwayh at Bab al-Shamasiyah. Its location is excellent. It is a pleasant place with many gardens and trees. Nearby is a reed thicket. It is large, populated with its monks, priests, and those devoted to worship within it. It is one of the places bustling with revelry, intended for picnics and drinking. The feasts of the Christians in Baghdad are distributed among known monasteries, including the feasts of the Fast (Lent): The first Sunday of it is the feast of Dayr al-Asiyah, which is a mile from Samalu. The second Sunday: Dayr al-Zurayqiyah. The third Sunday: Dayr al-Zandaward. And the fourth Sunday: this Dayr Darmalis. Its feast is the best feast; the Christians of Baghdad gather at it, and no one who loves amusement and licentiousness remains except they follow them. People stay there for days and visit it at times other than feasts. Abu Abdullah bin Hamdun the Boon Companion has [poetry] about it: 'O Dayr Darmalis, how beautiful you are... and O gazelle of the monastery, how enchanting you are. If you inhabit the monastery, O my master... then in the core of my heart is your dwelling. Woe to you, O heart, will you not cease... from the intensity of passion for one who saddened you? Be gentle with him, by Allah, O my master... for from his time he has enabled you.' The story of this poem is what Ahmad bin Khalid al-Sarifini mentioned. He said: We were with Abu Abdullah bin Hamdun at the time when Al-Mutawakkil exiled him. We discussed monasteries, their pleasantness and beauty during feasts, and the gathering of people there. He said: 'By Allah, you have made me desire to attend these places, watch within them, and find solace in them. So which monastery's feast has arrived?' I said: 'Dayr Darmalis, and tomorrow is its feast!' He said: 'So with Allah's blessing.' I prepared everything needed and suitable for such an occasion, and we went early to the monastery. We looked at the gathering of people and their celebrating. Those who left, left, and I stayed with him in the monastery that day and the next. We sat in a place overlooking those gardens and farms. He drank, his soul was pleased, and he was delighted. Some of the youths of the place attended to us, fulfilling our needs and bringing us novelties and greetings. He became fond of them and found his time with them pleasant, and he recited the aforementioned verses. The reason for Al-Mutawakkil exiling him was that Al-Fath bin Khaqan was in love with Shahik, Al-Mutawakkil's servant, and the matter became famous until it reached him. He has poems about him, among them: 'O Shahik, my night since you abandoned is long... and my eye sheds blood after tears. And I have from you, by the Merciful, what I cannot bear... and there is no way to complain to you. O Shahik, if a lover were rewarded for his affection... I would be rewarded, but loyalty is scarce.' Abu Abdullah used to strive for what Al-Fath loved. Al-Mutawakkil learned the news, summoned Abu Abdullah, and said to him: 'I only wanted you and brought you close to be my boon companion, not to pimp for my boys!' He denied that and swore an oath which he broke [pertaining to divorce and freeing slaves], so he divorced whoever was free of his wives, freed whoever was a slave, and obligated himself to Hajj for thirty years, so he used to perform Hajj every year. He said: So Al-Mutawakkil ordered his exile to Tikrit, where he stayed for days. Then Zarafa came to him at night by post. When that reached him, he thought—meaning Al-Mutawakkil, when he drank at night and got drunk—he had ordered his killing, so he surrendered to Allah's command. When [Zarafa] entered upon him, he said: 'I came for something I would not like to come for the like of!' He asked: 'What is it?' He said: 'The Commander of the Faithful ordered the cutting of your ear!' And he said: 'Tell him: I am only treating you as youths (fityan) are treated!' He saw that as easier than what he thought of killing. So he cut the cartilage of his ear from the outside, not completely, put it in camphor with him, and left. He remained exiled. Then Abu Abdullah was brought down to Baghdad, to his house. He stayed there for a period. Abu Abdullah said: I met Ishaq bin Ibrahim al-Mawsili after he had become blind. He asked me about the news of people and the Sultan. I informed him and then complained to him of my grief over the cutting of my ear. He began consoling and comforting me, then said to me: 'Who is the prominent one today with the Commander of the Faithful and the special one among his boon companions?' I said to him: 'Muhammad bin Umar al-Baziyar.' He said to me: 'And who is this man? And what is the extent of his literature and knowledge?' I said: 'As for his literature, I do not know, but I will tell you what I heard from him recently: We attended the palace on the day Al-Mutawakkil arranged the covenant for his three sons. Marwan bin Abi al-Janub bin Abi Hafsa entered and recited his Qasida in which he says: \"A white one, in her cheeks... are roses, so how can we smell them?\"'",

    "text": "Al-Mutawakkil was extremely pleased with that and ordered a purse of dinars to be scattered over him, and that it be picked up and thrown into his lap. He ordered him to sit and assigned him the governance of Yamama and Bahrain. [Muhammad bin Umar al-Baziyar] said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, I have never seen the like of today, nor will I see, may Allah keep you as long as the heavens and earth endure!' Before that, [Al-Mutawakkil] had said to him: 'What do you say about his literature?' He said: 'Is it more than Kathir says?' Ishaq said to me: 'Woe to you! You panicked over your ear and its cutting grieved you? Why? To hear such speech? Then he said to me: Woe to you! If you had a measure (makkuk) of ears, what benefit would it be to you with these people?' He said: Al-Mutawakkil returned him to his service. Whenever he called for him, he would say jokingly: 'O Abu Ubayd.' When he was pleased with him, he said to him: 'Would you like a slave girl I gift to you?' He considered that great and denied it [modestly]. So he gifted him a slave girl called Sahib, from his own slave girls, beautiful and of perfect manners, except that one of the servants had pushed back a blowpipe against her mouth when she wanted to shoot him, cracking one of her front teeth so it turned black, which marred her in his eyes. He sent with her all that belonged to her, which was a great deal. When Abu Abdullah died, Sahib married an Alawite. Ali bin Yahya bin al-Munajjim said: I saw him in a dream saying to me: 'Abu Ali, do you not see the wonders... My body has become absent in the dust. And Sahib has replaced me with a companion (Sahib) after me.' Abu Abdullah has good poetry. Among his poetry reproaching Ali bin Yahya: 'Who will excuse me from Abu Hasan... when he shuns me and cuts me off? He was a friend to me and I to him... like the mixing of the soul with the body. But a slanderer slandered, so he changed him... and he used to envy me over him. He will only increase in knowledge... of my affection when he loses me.' He said: It reached Najah bin Salama that Abu Abdullah bin Hamdun mentions him and makes jokes about him in front of Al-Mutawakkil. Najah met him one day and said to him: 'O Abu Abdullah: I have heard of your mentioning me in the presence of the Commander of the Faithful with other than what is beautiful, and your saying is not hidden from me! Would you like me to convey to him your saying when you were alone with him: \"Do you think I love him, when he has done to me what he did? By Allah, I never put my hand on my ear except a hatred for him was renewed in my heart.\"' Ibn Hamdun said: 'Divorce is binding on him if he ever said this, and his wife is divorced if I ever mention you with other than what you like!' He said: Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Mudabbir used to play backgammon with Abu Abdullah. If he won something from him, he gave it to Kurdiyyah the singer, the slave girl of Muhammad bin Raja. One day he won twenty dinars from him, took them from him, and gave them to her. Abu Abdullah wrote to him after that: 'You pay rights with my money... while you know my condition. If this continues against me... you will impoverish me and my family!' His father Ibrahim, and I think he is the one nicknamed Hamdun bin Ismail, was a boon companion to Al-Mu'tasim, then Al-Wathiq after him. He used to joke with Al-Mutawakkil at that time. He came to him once with a snake in his sleeve and brought out its head, alluding to his mother Shuja' (Snake), and Al-Wathiq liked that. He said: When Al-Wathiq died, Hamdun became a boon companion to Al-Mutawakkil. He said: One day, Al-Mutawakkil ordered the presence of Farida, the slave girl of his brother Al-Wathiq—and she was of beauty and proficiency the likes of which had not been seen. He said to the servants: 'If she does not come, bring me her head!' She was brought against her will. A lute was given to her, and she sang a song resembling wailing and elegy. He listened to her and ordered her to sing something else. She wept and sang a sorrowful song with sadness. That increased the goodness of her singing. Hamdun was struck dumb by the pity that entered him! Al-Mutawakkil got angry and saw that he did that because of his brother Al-Wathiq, out of grief for him, and he hated everyone who leaned towards him! So he ordered his exile to Sind and that he be flogged three hundred lashes! He asked that the flogging be over the clothes due to his weakness, and that was granted. He remained exiled for three years. Al-Mutawakkil married Farida after that, and she bore him his son Abu al-Hasan. He said: Ibrahim invited a group of singers, including Jahza and Qasim bin Zarzar, and his uncle Abu Muhammad bin Hamdun was among them. Ibrahim began imitating the singers one by one. His uncle said to him: 'Do not imitate Jahza, and let there be no action between you and him!' He did not accept and imitated him. Jahza kept plotting for something to write about him until he found a note, on which he wrote: 'I obtained the imitation of one who sings... He imitated for us the old woman when she sang. And he imitated for us Labib when he came to her... and gave her the strong [penis] as she wished.' His uncle said to him: 'Did I not tell you: A scorpion, do not approach!'",

    "text": "Jahza narrated from Ibrahim bin al-Qasim Zarzar that Lakuhkayfi was a good, proficient singer, and he used to envy Ibrahim bin Abi al-Ubayyis for his singing and the pathos of his voice. When Ibrahim died—and his death was in the days of Al-Muktafi—Lakuhkayfi entered upon me with tears in his eyes. He said: 'What is the matter?' I said: 'Ibrahim died!' He said: 'With peace! By Allah, if he hadn't died, I would have killed him!' \n\n**Dayr Samalu (Monastery of Samalu)**\nThis monastery is east of Baghdad, at Bab al-Shamasiyah, on the Mahdi Canal. There are water mills there, surrounded by gardens, trees, and palm trees. The place is pleasant, well-constructed, populated by those who visit it and by the monks within it. The feast of Easter in Baghdad is a wondrous sight there. Because no Christian remains but attends and offers sacrifice there, nor any Muslim lover of music and amusement but heads there to picnic. It is one of the famous parks of Baghdad and mentioned places of revelry. Muhammad bin Abdul Malik al-Hashimi has [poetry] in it: 'How many a day in Samalu was complete for me... in joy, and its sorrows were absent. And a brother who mixes his speech with sweetness... his boon companions delight in the return of his speech. Pure nectar of wine is his drink... and beautiful, friendly women are his affair. The visit came early to me with him, so he went... in delight to me, and his coming pleased me. So I ordered our cupbearer and said to him, give us drink... the time of our drink and its moment has come. Its intoxications played with our minds... and its fires ignited in our cheeks. Until I thought the carpet was a ship for us... and the monastery's walls were dancing around us.' Khalid the Writer has [poetry] in it: 'O abode of revelry in Samalu... I have no departure from your goodness. Hail to your past days... and life is pure in them, clear water. That is truly the life of souls... and for you, anything less is impossible.' He is Abu al-Haytham Khalid bin Yazid the Writer. He had beautiful, delicate poetry, speaking only of love (Ghazal), not exceeding four verses, nor increasing upon them. He had no poetry in praise or satire. Maymun bin Hammad mentioned, saying: Abu Abdullah Ibn al-A'rabi entered upon me one day. I said: 'O Abu Abdullah, have you heard anything of this little boy's poetry?' He said: 'Who is he?' I said: 'Khalid bin Yazid.' He said: 'No, and indeed I would like that!' So he called for him. He came and stood. I said: 'Recite to Abu Abdullah something of your poetry.' He said: 'I only speak of the sorrows of my own soul; I neither praise nor satirize.' I said: 'Recite to him.' So he recited: 'I say to illness: Return to my body... out of love for something that is from your cause.' Ibn al-A'rabi said: 'Enough, O boy! For I imagine that delicacy has been gathered for you in this verse.' Jahza said: Khalid the Writer told me: 'I was at Dayr Samalu, when suddenly the messenger of Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi came to me. I entered upon him, and behold, a black man with thick lips had sunk into the mattress. He asked me to sit, so I sat. He said: \"Recite to me something of your poetry.\" I said: \"O Emir, I am a boy who speaks of the sorrows of my own soul; I hardly praise or satirize.\" He said: \"That is stronger for the causes of tribulation.\" So I recited to him: \"My eye saw two sights from him as it saw... from the full moon and the sun illuminating the earth. In the evening he greeted me with a rose as if it were... cheeks added some to some. And he handed me a cup as if its saliva was... my tears when my sleep was barred from my eye. He turned away, and drunkenness did to his movements... from the wine, the action of the wind on the tender branch.\" He crawled until he was in the two-thirds of the prayer rug. Then he said: \"O my son, people likened cheeks to roses, and you likened roses to cheeks! Give me more.\" So I recited to him: \"I reproached my soul regarding your love... but I did not find it accepting. And I answered its caller to you... and obeyed not him who blames. No, by the One who made faces... exemplify the beauty of your face. I did not say that patience from you... is more beautiful than youthful passion.\" He crawled until he was outside the prayer rug. Then he said: \"Give me more!\" So I recited to him: \"Live, for your two loves are quickly my killer... and wasting away, if you do not join me, is my joiner. Love won a heart sick... with you, and illness a wasting body. So between depression and wasting... they left me like the withered branch. And the blamer wept for me out of my mercy... so my weeping is for the weeping of the blamer.\" He shouted and said: \"O Balayq: How much gold do I have with you?\" He said: \"Six hundred and fifty dinars.\" He said: \"Divide it between me and them [the women/singers?], and give the fraction completely to the boy.\"'",

    "text": "Ahmad bin Sadaqa the Singer mentioned, saying: I passed by Khalid the Writer one day, and said to him: 'Make me some verses that I can sing to the Commander of the Faithful'—meaning Al-Ma'mun. He said: 'What luck is there for me in that? You take the prize, and I get the sin!' So I swore to him that if he rewarded me with anything, I would share it with him. He said to me: 'You are too base for that! But remind him of me, perhaps he will give me something.' I said: 'I will do it.' So he recited to me: 'She says: He forgot. Then who is the sick one... and from whose eye are tears always flowing? And who has an anxious, beating heart... over you, while his guts tremble?' I memorized the poetry and composed a melody for it. We attended Al-Ma'mun the next day with the singers. There was an estrangement between him and one of his favorites. She sent him an amber apple with 'O my master, I have forgotten' written on it in civet. Allah knows I knew nothing of the news. The turn came to me, and I began to sing Khalid's poetry. When I sang it to him, Al-Ma'mun's face turned red, his eyes rolled in his head, and anger appeared on his face. He said: 'Do you have spies on my harem?' I stood up out of reverence for what I saw from him and said: 'I seek refuge for the Commander of the Faithful with Allah that he thinks this thought of his slave, and I declare his house far above having a spy upon it for anyone!' He said: 'Then from where did you know my news with my slave girl when you sang about what is between us?' So I swore to him that I knew nothing of that, and told him my story with Khalid. When I reached his saying: 'You are too base for that!', he said: 'I testify that you are like that,' and his face brightened. He said: 'How amazing is this coincidence!' He ordered five thousand dirhams for me, and the like for Khalid. From Khalid's beautiful poetry: 'How does the lover's liver melt... [from] what hearts endure from eyes? How do you see the lover's body... a sorrow that has no doctor but him? Where, where is sleep, O my eye, from... the heat of his guts, a watcher over it? O place of love, you are devoid of patience... so solace has no share in you.' From his beautiful poetry: 'I did not know the strain of love and its trial... and its intensity until I found you in my heart. My glance obeyed you regarding my heart, so it possessed it... for your glance, until it became in the grip of love.' From his poetry, which has a melody: 'Beauty borrowed from his face... and the soft branch from his stature. We reproached each other with our eyes... regarding what the breach of his promise committed. Until we wounded each other by our repeating... of the glance in my cheek and in his cheek.' He also has: 'What would it harm the angry one if he were pleased... and pitied me for the prolonging of my illness? He said to me when I complained of love... Praise Allah, thus it was decreed. I said: Allah forbid that He decrees this... rather the owner of the radiant face decreed it. You chased away my sleep unjustly... so make justice a substitute for it.' He also has: 'You departed, so how many a moan after a sigh... clarifying to people my longing for you. I had freed the eyelids from weeping... but my sadness over you returned them to slavery.' He also has: 'He visited me in a rosy [robe] like his cheek... and a necklace whose beads are camphor. A night in which there was no fault... nor shortcoming except the shortness of the night.' Jahza said: I was with Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz one day, and I looked for my sandal but did not find it. So I began to say: 'O people, who is for my sandal... or in a copy (Mushaf) a Na'l (Sura/Verse)?' This verse traveled until children recited it. He said: Ubaydullah invited me one day, and I was slow to come to him, so he wrote to me: 'Do not abandon the Emirs who have gone far on... a horse of al-h[aqq?] qirat [unclear phrase].' So Jahza wrote back to him: 'Whoever is a servant of your likes, his horse... is the horse of barefootedness and his religion is a Tassuj (fraction of a dirham/small measure).' Jahza said: I used to love a girl among the singing slave girls called Sherwin. She got drunk at my place one night and defecated in my pail and my bathing vessel and left. Al-Hadahidi wrote to me: 'A friend visited me whom I am pleased with... sweet of character, outweighing in intellect. So by the right of Sherwin who defecated... in the basin and the pitcher and the pail. Unless you come hastening quickly... and relieve from distress and delay. So that I see you when you get drunk and have... shared with her in that deed!' Jahza wrote to Ibn Tarkhan inviting him: 'We have, O my brother, a plentiful meal... and a pot hurried, present. And whatever you wish of good news... and a rare joke after a rare joke.",

    "text": "'And wine that shows you, when purified... the flash of lightning on a rainy night. And a proficient [singer] whom correctness has not betrayed... and a flute player, what a flute player! So you missed out, and if you were, O son of the noble... and God forbid you from that, in the Hereafter. Do I not know where the heart resides... O place of the heart, where is the heart? The guts pushed it away from what is next to them... so burning and kindling melted it.' He has: 'You went far, but wasting did not go far from him... and you returned, so he returned to his relapse. And patience parted from him in his day... due to what he missed of you in his yesterday. And a lonely one, familiar with weeping... over his heart and over his intimacy. His passion pities his guts... and longing mourns for him from himself.'\n\n**Dayr al-Thaalib (Monastery of the Foxes)**\nThis monastery is in Baghdad, on its western side, at the place known as Bab al-Hadid (Iron Gate). The people of Baghdad visit it and picnic in it, and it is hardly devoid of a visitor or passerby. It has a feast which no one, Christian or Muslim, misses. Bab al-Hadid is the most populated place in Baghdad and the most pleasant, due to the gardens, trees, palm trees, and aromatic plants in it, and its central location in the city and proximity to everyone. It is not devoid of idle people, nor do people of revelry and pleasures neglect it. Its spots are always populated, and its grounds are filled with picnickers. Poets have spoken about the Monastery, Bab al-Hadid, and Qabruniya extensively, and described the beauty of those places. Ibn Dihqana al-Hashimi has [poetry] in it: 'Dayr al-Thaalib is the haunt of errors... and the place of every gazelle (female) and gazelle (male). How many a night I revived in it, and my boon companion... in it is heavy-hipped, distinct of limbs. Generous, giving his soul, so when he passed... and died, I was generous to him and gave my wealth. And excellent is the religion of the Son of Mary as a religion... coquetry mixing his licentiousness with pampering. I gave him drink and drank the remainder of his cup... so I drank pure water from sweet taste.' This Ibn Dihqana is from the descendants of Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas, known as Abu Ja'far Muhammad bin Umar. He has beautiful poetry. Jahza mentioned that he recited to him: 'Is it when I cut off those who connected for you... and was generous to you and not miserly? You betrayed and showed me cruelty... and wronged me and were not just? Should I hope in another who loves you... when you did not observe the sanctity of the first for me?' Jahza mentioned that he was the governor of Basra during the days of the Zanj, and that he took thirty thousand dinars from the Najim (rebel) there and surrendered Basra to him. Jahza used to stay with him frequently and not miss him. He said: 'I was late in visiting him at one time due to an obstacle that occurred to me. He sent for me inviting me. I wrote to him: \"I am, by Allah, ill! And it is not the decoration of the tongue and its crafting... but it has mixed with the flesh and blood.\" He sent me fifty dinars and a robe, and said: \"This removes the illness, so by my life, come to me!\" So I went to him.' Jahza mentioned that he used to be a boon companion to Al-Mu'tamid and Al-Muwaffaq. He was large in build, heavy in body. When the Caliph stood up and returned, and the boon companions stood up, he would sleep and say: 'This is the compensation for standing since I was unable to do it.' He was a glutton, so he used to say: 'I have eaten until I became chronically ill, and I want to eat until I die!' From his poetry: 'If there was rest in my panic... I would have been the most panicking of those who panic. I will be patient with my effort upon what you see... and if my patience is exhausted, what shall I do?' Al-Nashi' mentions Bab al-Hadid and Qabruniya: 'The sturdy one is not sturdy on the day of dew... you went far, though the shrine is not far. Tears informed of her conscience... becoming a helper against the lovesick heart. O nights of pleasures, by Allah, return... between Qabruniya and Bab al-Hadid. Between those hills, when the rain has woven... with the hand of spring the sheets of robes. His cheek is opposite his temple just as the promise... when you test, is the opposite of the threat. The drum demanded benefits from the flute... and joy returned when my oud returned.' From his delicate poetry: 'I did not forget you, nor betray you, nor was there... in the heart of mine a place for solace. But I saw you had tired of my affection... so I knew that your medicine was abandonment.' \n\n**Dayr al-Jathaliq (Monastery of the Catholicos)**",

    "text": "This monastery is near Bab al-Hadid. It is a large, beautiful, pleasant monastery, surrounded by gardens, trees, and aromatic plants. It parallels Dayr al-Thaalib in pleasantness, goodness, and the population of the area, because they are in one spot. It is intended and visited, never devoid of picnickers and those seeking it. In it are its monks, youths, and those who frequent it from the people of licentiousness and idleness. Poets have spoken of it and described it. Muhammad bin Abi Umayya the Writer has [poetry] in it, with a light Ramal melody: 'My sorrow for a moon imprisoned in the monastery... in the form of humans, with the cunning of devils. By Allah, my eye never saw his beauties... except I went out for him obediently from the religion.' He also has in this monastery: 'I remembered Dayr al-Jathaliq and youths... with whom joy was complete for me there and aided. Through them the world became good and its joy complete... and the vicissitudes of time made peace with me and were just. O how many a day I enjoyed its shade... rushing to the pure pleasures of my life. I flirt in it with a black-eyed, slender one... and I am given to drink in it a wine of musky taste. So hail to days passed for me in their proximity... they extended to me kindness and sympathy. And woe to days that threw me among them... and a time that demanded repayment for what it had lent.' This Muhammad bin Umayya is one of the early poets, of delicate nature, good conduct in poetry, and strange meanings. Most of his poetry is in Ghazal (love poetry). He and his brother Ali used to write for Al-Fadl bin al-Rabi'. He is the uncle of Abu Hashisha the Tanbur player. From his beautiful poetry: 'I saw you as my ornament, world and religion... life for the bedfellow and the companion. It appeared to me, after my right hand preceded... with abandoning you, that I should atone for my oath.' He has: 'I did not forget you, nor betray you, nor was there... in the heart of mine a place for solace. But I saw you had tired of my affection... so I knew that your medicine was abandonment.' From his delicate poetry: 'O stranger weeping for every stranger... who has not tasted before it the separation of a beloved. Patience overcame him, so he rested in tears... and in tears is rest for hearts. Would that I see you one day as you were... near, so I could complain to a near one.' He has: 'Many a day from you I do not forget... obligated thanks even if you did not do [good]. I cut through time with good thought... and cleared a flood that would not clear. And I see the days do not bring near what... I hope from you, but bring near my term. Whenever I hoped for a good day... abandonment presented itself before the hope.' From his rare poetry: 'I will surely hold a funeral soon... there is nothing after separation but wailing. Calamities have darkened me regarding you, so I was not able... to repel the injustice of calamities. Lord, how painful is love to hearts... no, especially the separation of the beloved. I did not know separation, so I advanced... upon it inexperienced, without trial.' He also has: 'Today my patience has bereft me of your separation... thus is the greatest thing, the loss of a beloved. I was in spaciousness before regarding you... so today I have become, from sorrows, in a strait. And a time I used to trust assassinated me... woe to its treachery after documentation. Indeed, I did not break your affection by covenant... O you who sees breaking covenants as good.' He has: 'The soul has not tasted upon desire... anything sweeter than the affection of a trustworthy friend. Whoever misses the affection of a righteous brother... that is the cheated one in truth of certainty.' He has, and it is of his beautiful poetry: 'O longing do not run out, and O tear overflow and increase... and O longing alternate between side to side. And O my blamer blame me, and O worshiper miss me... I disobeyed you both until I am hidden in the dust. If my Lord is knowledgeable of my secret... then people are not greater in my eye than my Lord.' He has, describing a garden: 'In gardens as if spread over... their soil is a green silk. The eyes of the fresh narcissus are stars... and the greenness of the meadows in them is a sky. For the soil beneath them is sleep, and for the water... is a murmur, and for the branches is singing.' He has: 'So here I am, overlooking for your satisfaction and patient... upon the like of a polished cutting sword. And withdrawing from what you hated, and placing... your satisfaction as an example between my eye and my eyebrow.' He has:",

    "text": "'How many a joy was, and how many a sorrow... suspicions fabricated for me regarding you. If hearts show other than what... they conceal, eyes inform you about them.' He has: 'He raises a breath in the guts... and stays awake if a youth dozes. He remains treating the sighs... whether he sleeps or sits. He fed his soul with longing... and distracted himself with \"perhaps\". A lover who turned the complaint to his companions into intimacy.' Abu Bakr Muhammad bin al-Qasim al-Anbari used to end his dictations in his sessions with a piece of Ibn Abi Umayya's poetry, admiring it and finding its words sweet, and he would always praise and describe him. \n\n**Dayr Madyan (Monastery of Madyan)**\nThis monastery is on the Karkhaya canal in Baghdad. Karkhaya is a canal that splits from the Great Muhawwal, passes by Al-Abbasiya, splits Karkh, and pours into the Tigris. It was anciently populated, and the water in it flowing, then it was blocked and its flow cut off by the breaches that opened in the Euphrates. It is a beautiful, pleasant monastery, surrounded by gardens and buildings. It is intended for picnicking and drinking, and is never devoid of a visitor or passerby. It is one of the beautiful, pleasant spots. Al-Husayn bin al-Dahhak has [poetry] in it: 'Urge the wine, for the cup is full... of what stirs the motives of longing sometimes. Indeed, I was delighted by monks answering... in holiness, after the quiet of the night, monks. So they startled a sorrow from me by which I remembered... Karkh of Iraq, and brothers and sorrows. So I said, while the tear in my eye was flowing... and longing ignited fires in the guts: O Dayr Madyan, may you not be stripped of inhabitants... how much illness you stirred, O Dayr Madyana. Does your priest have knowledge to inform me... how the face of patience aids the one who departed? Hail and care to Karkhaya and its inhabitant... between Al-Junayna and Al-Rawha', whoever was.' He said: Abu Ali bin al-Rashid used to stick to this monastery and drink in it. He had singing girls he brought to it, and he would stay there for days, not ceasing from music and revelry. He was excessively dissolute! Those neighboring the place complained of what they encountered from him. The news reached Ishaq bin Ibrahim al-Tahiri, who was the deputy of the Sultan in Baghdad. He sent to him reproaching his action and forbidding him from repeating the like. He said: 'What hand does Ishaq have over me? And what command does he have regarding me? Do you think he prevents me from listening to my slave girls and drinking where I desire?' When this saying of his reached him, it angered him, and he waited until night fell. He rode to the place, surrounded it from all sides, and ordered the door of the monastery to be opened and him to be brought down in the state he was in. He was brought down drunk in dyed clothes, smeared with saffron perfume. He said to him: 'Shame on you! A man from the children of the Caliphate in such a state?' Then he ordered a rug to be spread at the door of the monastery, laid him on it, and flogged him twenty lashes, saying: 'The Commander of the Faithful did not appoint me his deputy so that I waste affairs and neglect them, nor so that I let you and others of his family disgrace him and expose him, and go out to what you went out to of indecency, notoriety, violating sanctity, and taking them [women] out to monasteries and taverns. In disciplining you is a preservation of the Caliphate, and a deterrence for you and others from this scandal.' Then he ordered litters that were with him, mounted him in them with his harem, and returned him to his house. That reached Al-Mu'tasim, so he wrote to him approving his opinion and action, and ordering him not to permit anyone of his family the like.",

    "text": "The mother of this Abu Ali is known as Shakl. Al-Rashid had bought her and a companion of hers known as Shadhar on the same day. Shadhar became pregnant and gave birth to Umm Abiha; Shakl envied her, and envy led her to a great matter of enmity, until it became famous. Shakl became pregnant and gave birth to Abu Ali. Their mothers died, but the enmity remained between Abu Ali and Umm Abiha, until the matter reached the point that they satirized each other with poetry, and their affair became widespread among all the family of Al-Rashid! When Al-Amin was killed and Al-Ma'mun arrived in Baghdad, he sat one day with his uncle Ibrahim bin al-Mahdi, his brother Abu Ishaq, and his son Al-Abbas, and they discussed the enmity between these two. He said: 'I have heard the news of their enmity in Khurasan, and I have resolved to reconcile them.' He sent for Umm Abiha and she was brought. He began reproaching her while she looked down, not returning an answer. Then he ordered the presence of Abu Ali. When Umm Abiha saw him, she veiled herself and covered her face. Al-Ma'mun said: 'You were unveiled, then when your brother arrived you veiled yourself?' She said: 'By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, my unveiling before Abdullah bin Tahir and Ali bin Hisham is more obligatory than my unveiling for Abu Ali! By Allah, he is not a brother to me nor a son to Al-Rashid! Allah Almighty said regarding Quraysh: \"Who fed them from hunger and secured them from fear.\" Ibn Abbas said: Secured them from leprosy and elephantiasis. And he, by Allah, is leprous, and he is nothing but the son of So-and-so the carpet spreader!' So Al-Ma'mun ordered his brother Abu Ishaq, and he flogged her a Hadd punishment. She said: 'Shame, O Commander of the Faithful, that you inflict a Hadd on your sister for the sake of the son of the carpet spreader, and establish the Hadd on the daughters of the Caliphs! By Allah, I thought his matter would be concealed, but now, by Allah, the narrators will transmit it and talk about it until the Hour rises!' And she rose. Al-Ma'mun said: 'May Allah curse her! If she were a man, she would have been more entitled to the Caliphate than many of the Caliphs!' Abu Ali used to refuse to pray over the funerals of the Caliphs' children to ward off the defect from himself. We return to mentioning Ishaq bin Ibrahim and present a portion of his news regarding his firmness and control, as much as befits the book. This Ishaq is the nephew of Tahir bin al-Husayn, and his kunya is Abu al-Hasan. Al-Ma'mun had adopted him and appointed him as deputy to Abdullah bin Tahir in his presence when Abdullah was sent to Khurasan. He was the most advanced of people with him and most specialized to him. Abdullah bin Khurdadhbih mentioned that he attended Al-Ma'mun's assembly one day, and Ahmad bin Abi Khalid presented petitions to him, including a petition from people complaining about Ishaq bin Ibrahim. When Al-Ma'mun read it, he took the pen and wrote on its back: 'There is nothing in these rabble but every slandering backbiter! Ishaq is my cultivation by my hand, and whom I planted produced noble offspring and did not fail. I will not help anyone against him.' Then he wrote a note to Ishaq, saying: 'From a compassionate educator to a prudent educated one. O my son, whoever is mighty should be humble, whoever is capable should forgive, whoever observes should be just, and whoever watches should be cautious. The consequence of presumption is not praiseworthy, and the believer is clever and intelligent. Peace.' Ishaq governed for Al-Ma'mun, then for Al-Mu'tasim, then for Al-Wathiq, then for Al-Mutawakkil. He died in the days of Al-Mutawakkil. He established his son Muhammad in his place, who remained a short while and died. Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir was summoned from Khurasan, and what was Ishaq's was returned to him. They mentioned that one of Al-Rashid's children—who had a position of lineage and a place of knowledge and literature—fell ill in Baghdad with a prolonged illness. He could not ride and desired to relax and picnic in the water. He wanted to build a Zallal (a type of boat/structure) to sit in. Ishaq prevented him and said: 'This is something we do not like the like of to be made except by the command and permission of the Commander of the Faithful.' He wrote to Al-Mu'tasim asking his permission for that. The order came out to Ishaq to allow it for him. Ishaq wrote: 'A letter came to me from the Commander of the Faithful allowing the building of a Zallal, but he did not define for me its length or width, so I suspended his matter until I seek opinion on that.' He wrote to him praising him for his caution and defining for him the dimensions of the Zallal. He said: When Al-Mu'tasim moved to Surra Man Ra'a, people used to visit Al-Ma'mun's house on the day of the procession and sit in it according to their custom during his life, out of reverence for the Sultan and honoring his command. Muhammad bin Ishaq returned on one of the hot days, having ridden for a long time. He passed by Al-Ma'mun's house, having twisted his cap on his head, shielding himself with it from the sun. That reached his father, so he beat him, punishing him for passing by the Caliph's door in a casual manner!",

    "text": "Abdullah bin Khurdadhbih mentioned that he went out one day from before Al-Ma'mun following Ishaq bin Ibrahim. When he reached the second vestibule, he stopped, and the commanders and people stopped because of his stopping! Then he said: 'Where is the deputy of Ali bin Salih?' Ali was at that time the master of the house affairs and titled with Chamberlainship (Hajabah). His deputy was brought, so he flogged him one hundred lashes, then said: 'To prison!' Then he said: 'Bring the deputy of the Postmaster.' He was brought, so he flogged him one hundred lashes, then said: 'To prison!' Then he called for Ali bin Salih and the Postmaster and said to them: 'Do you entrust your deputyship in the Caliph's house to those who waste affairs and neglect them? You were more deserving of this discipline than these two!' They said: 'And what was their matter that you disapproved of, O Emir?' He said: 'A postmaster sits in the Caliph's house, laughing and guffawing, and the master of the house is sitting and does not disapprove?' Then he left! He said: I used to enter the house after that, and I would not see anyone laughing in it! He said: Ishaq entered upon Al-Mutawakkil on the day of Nayruz, and the Samaja (masked entertainers) were before him. On Al-Mutawakkil was a heavy embroidered robe. The owners of the Samaja had increased until they came close to him to pick up the dirhams scattered over them, and they pulled his hem! When Ishaq saw that, he turned away angry, saying: 'Uff and Tuff! What does our guarding the kingdom avail with this negligence!' Al-Mutawakkil saw him turning away, so he said: 'Woe to you! Bring back Abu al-Husayn, for he has gone out angry!' The chamberlains and servants went out behind him. He entered while making Wasif and Zarafa hear every unpleasant thing, until he reached Al-Mutawakkil. He said: 'What angered you, and why did you leave?' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, perhaps you imagine that this kingdom does not have enemies like it has friends! You sit in an assembly where the likes of these dogs debase you, pulling your hem, and each one of them is disguised in a hideous form. What secures that there might be among them an enemy who has counted himself for religion, having a corrupt intention and bad conscience, so he jumps on you! When could this be rectified, even if I emptied the earth of them?' He said: 'O Abu al-Husayn, do not be angry! By Allah, you will never see me in the like of it again.' A balcony was built for Al-Mutawakkil after that, from which he looked at the Samaja. Musa bin Salih bin Sheikh mentioned that he spoke to Ishaq bin Ibrahim regarding a woman of his family, asking him to look into her matter. He said: 'O Abu Muhammad, who is the story of this woman, and what is her condition, and who is her husband?' He said: By Allah, he did not cease describing her until I was bewildered. Abu al-Barq the Poet said: Ishaq used to allocate stipends for me. I recited to him one day, so he asked me about my family and what I needed for them. Then he said to me: 'Your family needs every month so much flour, and so much of this...' He kept informing me of things about my household affairs that I was ignorant of and he knew! He said: A letter from Al-Mu'tasim arrived to Ishaq while he was sitting drinking, and with him was Muhammad bin Rashid al-Khannaq, who was special to him and favored by him. He did not finish reading the letter before he said: 'Whips, racks, and executioners!' They were brought. He ordered Muhammad bin Rashid, so he was raised from his seat, his clothes ripped, and he was set up on the racks, saying: 'O Emir, what is my condition? What is my story?' He said: 'The jewel box that belonged to So-and-so, of such and such description, you bring it to me now, or else you have finished yourself!' He began to hesitate, so he said: 'Hurt him!' When he felt the beating, he said: 'I will bring it, O Emir.' He said: 'By the right of the Commander of the Faithful, you will not leave your place until you bring it!' So he brought it immediately. When Ishaq saw it, he was relieved, his face brightened, and he said: 'Bring clothes.' A robe was brought, and he dressed him. He returned him to his place. He answered the letter and sent the box immediately to Al-Mu'tasim. Muhammad said: 'O Emir, how far is what is between the two actions?' He said: 'Woe to you! I fulfilled the service and advice, and I fulfilled the affection after that its due.' Abu Hashisha the Tanbur player mentioned, saying: I was in my house one day, when the Postmaster knocked on the door and said: 'Answer!' When he said answer, I knew it was a high matter. I dressed and went with him until we entered the house of Ishaq bin Ibrahim. He turned me to a long corridor with facing rooms, from all of which the smells of food wafted. I was put into one of the rooms, and food of the utmost cleanliness and good smell was presented to me, so I ate. They brought me three rotls (cups), and I drank. They brought me a box with tanburs, so I chose a tanbur from them, tuned it to the mode, and was taken out from the place to a room the likes of which I had never seen better. Behold, in its sitting area were two men sitting; on one was a mulham tunic and a sable cap, and on the other silk clothes; and a curtain was drawn in it. I greeted and was ordered to sit, so I sat. The owner of the sable cap said to me: 'Sing!' So I sang: 'I do not see myself but that I will abandon... one who does not see me capable of abandonment. He bored of me, trusting in the goodness of my loyalty... How harmful is loyalty to a human being!'",

    "text": "I sang it, so he drank a rotl, pecked the curtain, and said: 'Sing it!' The song was sung with the best singing in the world, and I thought the room was dancing! He said to me: 'How do you see?' I said: 'By Allah, O my master, they have made this song hateful to me and ugly in my eyes.' He laughed and asked me to repeat it three times, drinking a rotl each time. Then he said: 'Do you know me?' I said: 'No!' He said: 'I am Ishaq bin Ibrahim, and this is Muhammad bin Rashid al-Khannaq. By Allah, if the story of this gathering appears from you, I will flog you three hundred lashes! Stand up if you wish!' I stood up from before him, and the boy caught up with me with a purse containing three hundred dinars. I strove for him to take something from it, but he refused! Amr bin Bana mentioned, saying: Ishaq bin Ibrahim sent for me at the end of the day. I went to his house and was entered upon him while he was sitting in a pavilion (tarima) lined with silk, overlooking the Tigris. The moon had spread over the window and the Tigris, and it was one of the most beautiful sights I ever saw! All the singers were before him, and Badhl was sitting behind a screen in the pavilion. He remained sitting in his place, and we were before him, until the dawn prayer was called. He stood up and we stood up. The servants said to us: 'Depart!' We went down to the riverbank and called for a Sumerian boat. We all sat, and I said to them: 'My house is closer than your houses, so make your stay today at my place.' They did so. We arrived at the house, and I sought something to eat in it but found nothing! I ordered the table to be brought, so it was brought empty. I threw into its center one hundred whole dirhams and said: 'Let each one of you send and buy what he wants.' It was not long before it was filled with everything! We ate and drank, and a good day passed for us. We dispersed at the end of the day, with lumps in our throats from what Ishaq did to us, and what we missed of that beautiful night in that beautiful place! I went after that to Badhl and asked her about the reason for what he did. She said: 'I asked him about that, and he said: Woe to you! I have desired to drink on a night like this for a year, and I have been putting myself off. When I obtained everything I wanted and desired, I wanted to show my soul my authority over it and my conquering of it and preventing it from what it loves, lest it lead me to what it wants. So I did what you saw.' Despite that, he was of good chivalry, generous of soul. Abu Hashisha mentioned, saying: He invited me one day, so I went to him and sat singing to him. On him was a green silk tunic, the likes of which I had never seen. I kept looking at it, and he noticed my look. He called the treasurer and said: 'They brought us days ago ten green silk garments; this is one of them, so bring me the rest.' He brought nine garments, whose beauty exceeded all description. He gave them to me, and I sold the worst of them for one hundred dinars! He said: Ahmad bin Yusuf the Writer visited Ishaq bin Ibrahim at night. He presented to him every beautiful thing of food and instruments. Curtains were hung, and fruits and wine were brought. A day passed the likes of which had not been. Then he asked Ahmad to stay with him the next day. Ahmad said: 'I will miss the hunt.' So he brought a slave girl, a boy, and a horse, the likes of which had not been seen, and said: 'This is your hunt tomorrow.' Then he prepared for him the next day, and Ahmad saw something the likes of which he had never seen. Ishaq said to him: 'Yesterday was youthfulness (futuwwa), and today is chivalry (muruwwa).' Al-Ma'mun used to go to his house and stay with him for days, he and his servants and retinue, out of familiarity with him and trust in his place. Zubaydah passed by one day on the Tigris in her haraqa (barge). She went up to Ishaq's house for some need of hers. Ishaq offered her food, so she ordered it to be brought. She marveled at what she saw and what he presented. She said: 'By Allah, I had no need for it, but I wanted to test his chivalry. I found him the most complete of people in chivalry, and this was without preparation for me or knowledge of my coming.' \n\n**Dayr Ashmuni (Monastery of Ashmuni)**\nAshmuni was a woman; the monastery was built in her name, and she was buried in it. It is in Qatrabbul, west of the Tigris. Its feast is the third day of October (Tishrin al-Awwal). It is one of the great days in Baghdad; its people gather for it like their gathering for some of their feasts. No one of the people of music and play remains but goes out to it. Some are in Tayyarat (fly-boats), some in Zabazib (skiffs), and some in Sumerians, each person according to his ability. They compete in what they display there of their attire, boast of what they prepare for their revelry, and populate its bank, its sides, its monastery, and its taverns. Tents and pavilions are pitched for those of means among them, and singing girls play for them. Every person remains busy with his affair, devoted to his amusement; it is the most amazing sight and the best and most beautiful scene! There is also a monastery there called Dayr al-Jarjuth, surrounded by gardens and farms. Whoever finds Dayr Ashmuni crowded diverts to it.",

    "text": "Jahza said: I went out on one of the feasts of Ashmuni to Qatrabbul. When I reached the bank, I stretched my eyes to see an empty place to go up to, or some elegant people to descend upon. I saw two youths of the handsomest faces, cleanest clothes, and most novel instruments! I advanced my Sumerian towards them and said: 'Do you permit me to ascend to you?' They said: 'With welcome and spaciousness!' I ascended and said: 'Boy, my Tanbur and my wine!' They said: 'As for the Tanbur, yes; as for the wine, no.' I sat with people of the best character and most pleasant companionship. We started our affair. Then I took the Tanbur and sang a poem of mine: 'Hail to Ashmuni and its pleasures... and the life amidst its gardens. Hail to days passed for me in it... between its two banks and its taverns. When my morning drink was in its orchards... and my evening drink in its monasteries.' The group shouted [in joy], and drank by the rotls, and I drank. The time was pleasant for us until the end of the day. Then I said to one of them: 'May I be your ransom, I do not see in this gathering anyone softer in nature than you two, nor softer in wine.' He answered me saying: 'My wine is thin [delicate] as you have seen... and a friendship with an arrow mixed with a fly.' He pointed to the group, then said: 'So how can I be equal to them... where am I compared to your intellect, or is this a fart?' Then he said: 'Shall I give you more?' I said: 'No.' And the best and most beautiful day passed for us! Muhammad bin al-Mu'ammal al-Ta'i said: I was with Abu al-Atahiya in a Sumerian, and we were traveling to Ashmuni. He heard singing from some direction, admired it, and was delighted by it. He said to me: 'Can you dance?' I said: 'Yes!' He said: 'Stand up let us dance.' I said: 'We are in a Sumerian, and I fear we will drown!' He said: 'And if we drown, what will we be? Will we not be martyrs of delight?' Al-Tharwani has [poetry] in it: 'Drink to the striking of the bells (Nawaqis)... in Dayr Ashmuni at dark dawn. Do not fear the cup of drink, while the night is in... a limit of bliss, no, nor misery. Except to the striking of bells... or the voice of priests and deaconing (Tashmis). For a thing is by its causes... and precise description is by foundation. So drink like this, otherwise be... neighbor to some tombs (Nawawis).' He said: Yahya bin Kamil wrote to Abdul Malik bin Muhammad al-Hashimi on the day of Ashmuni: 'Today is Ashmuni, O Abu al-Fadl... and it is wonderful, pleasant of shade. And you are a victim to the day, so what... shall Yahya do, O Abu al-Fadl?' He sent him what he rode. Al-Jammash knew the news, so he wrote to him: 'Say to the skilled Abdul Malik... and to the cousin of the pure Chosen One. Do you not see the day, and its conditions... call for your urging of the circulating [cup]? A feast and a cloud visited in our day... so fulfill the right of the feast and the visitor. Today is Ashmuni, so hasten with us... urging it in its radiant day. You gifted Yahya then neglected me... you turned away from your Jammash the poet.' So he sent for him and brought him. And a pleasant day passed for them. Abu al-Shibl al-Burjumi has [poetry] in it: 'I witnessed all the places of pleasures... and roamed their spots by sea and land. I did not see a place like Ashmuni... more delicious to its attendees nor more joyful. In it are two armies of horses and ships... they knelt in its shelter and settled. As if they are crawls of war, but... to pleasures they attacked and fled. Their weapons are jugs and bottles... and cups circulating, drag along. And their striking is the third and second strings... when the striking in war intensifies. And the gazelles of the monastery capture them willingly... when the lions of wars are captured by force. Indeed, war has dragged good for us... if war ever dragged evil.' This Abu al-Shibl was one of the pleasant ones, having beautiful poetry and a delicate nature. He was devoted to drinking, never leaving it, and never found except drunk. He used to throw himself into monasteries, taverns, and places of amusement, never missing them nor delaying from them. There was affection between him and Mahmud al-Warraq, and they never separated. Abu al-Shibl mentioned, saying: I and Mahmud went to Qatrabbul. We called the vintner and said: 'Bring us a daughter of ten [years] whom the heat has matured.' He brought it to us. We said: 'Give us drink!' He gave us drink. We said: 'Drink and give us drink!' He said: 'I am a Muslim'—he was a Jew who had converted to Islam. Mahmud said to me: 'A people with whom the vintner is a scrupulous Muslim, while they are disbelievers in the vintner's view, do you think Allah has a need for them?'",

    "text": "He said: Abu al-Shibl used to joke with Khansa, the singing girl of Hisham the Blind Grammarian. She used to compose poetry. He joked with her one day and went too far. She got angry and said: 'I wish I knew, on what do you rely? I am, by Allah, more poetic than you! And if I wish, I will satirize you until I expose you!' He turned to her and said: 'Khansa has exceeded against us... so there is no protector for us from her. She acted haughty with her poems against us... as if Jarir had fucked her.' She became ashamed until it was visible on her, and she stopped answering him. Abu al-Shibl has [poetry] about a black slave girl he loved, for whom he was reproached, as he was fond of blacks: 'A blamer began with prolonged blame... blaming me for blackness and intense black eyes. Woe to you, how is solace from blazes... tarred of faces like obsidian. They carry between the thighs humps... whose wool flies from the glow. May Allah not punish a believer with them... other than me, nor may my relief come from them. For I am delighted with blackness... and I am not very delighted with whites.' He has [poetry] about a girl he loved named Tibr (Gold Dust): 'You were not fair, O namesake of gold... my soul perishes while you are in play. O cousin of the fragrant musk, and who... were it not for you, would not be collected nor smell good. The musk resembled you in blackness and in scent... so how noble is that lineage.' \n\n**Dayr Sabir (Monastery of Sabir)**\nThis monastery is in Bazugha, which is between Al-Mazrafah and Al-Salihiyya, on the western side of the Tigris. It is populated, pleasant, with many gardens, fruits, vineyards, taverns, and vintners, inhabited by people of music and drinking. It is a home of the dissolute. The monastery is beautiful, populated, never devoid of a picnicker in it and a music-seeker to it. Al-Husayn bin al-Dahhak has [poetry] in it: 'And young women I approached among gardens... so I deflowered them when they were authentically beautiful. I followed the pricking of that one with the pricking of this one... until I drank their blood as wounds. I brought them out of the boudoirs unveiled... and left the protection of their sanctity permissible. In Dayr Sabir while the morning loomed to me... so I gathered a full moon, and the morning, and wine. So go with your thought however you wish, for all of it... is from what I committed of arrogance and unruliness.' Al-Husayn bin al-Dahhak was among the literary poets and people of licentiousness and debauchery, and is known as Al-Khali' (The Dissolute). He was a boon companion to a group of Abbasid caliphs, among them: Al-Amin, Al-Mu'tasim, Al-Wathiq, and Al-Mutawakkil. As for Al-Ma'mun, he did not enter upon him nor mix with him, because he elegized Al-Amin, saying about him: 'Would that you remained to fill our need... among us, and destruction was for other than you. There was in you a successor for those who passed... so today the successor is lacking after you.' When Al-Ma'mun arrived from Khurasan to Baghdad, he ordered that the names of those suitable for his companionship from the people of literature be recorded for him. A group was recorded for him in which Al-Husayn bin al-Dahhak was mentioned, as he was among the sitters of Muhammad the Deposed. He read their names until he reached the name of Husayn. He said: 'Is he not the one who said about Muhammad: \"And destruction was for other than you\"? By Allah, I have no need for him, nor shall he see my face except on the main road!' So he did not gain anything throughout the days of Al-Ma'mun! At the time of his service to Al-Mutawakkil, he became weak with old age, so he wrote to him asking to be excused from service, saying: 'I advanced to your ancestors in the past... of my service, one and sixty [years]. I was twenty-five, and I have... completed some and eighty. I am known for the weakness of powers... even if I endure at times. And if I bear in my old age... the service of the sons of thirty. My powers have collapsed and my bones have weakened... and I have become Azzun in illness. And I feared that a hastener would hasten with me... to that which baffles the healers.' This Azzun whom he mentioned was a boon companion to Al-Mu'tasim, then he drank with Al-Mutawakkil. This Azzun mentioned, saying: We were with Al-Mu'tasim in some of his picnics. We needed to wade a river, and Husayn bin al-Dahhak was with us, and he almost drowned. Al-Mu'tasim grabbed his upper arm and carried him from the saddle until he crossed the river with him, out of pity for him. Al-Husayn was very infatuated with servants (eunuchs/boys), and he did not cease from that until he died. Al-Mutawakkil said: Husayn recited to me his saying: 'If you wished, you would have been easy... as you were named, O Yusr. No, by Allah, I will not leave... until the matter is decided. Either prevention and blame... or giving and thanks. So leave me from your promises... since time has destroyed you. So say: Which of them was it? ... He said: Giving and thanks.'",

    "text": "Abu Abdullah bin Hamdun said: We were with Al-Mutawakkil on the day of Nayruz, and gifts were being presented to him, including statues of amber. Shafi' the servant was standing, wearing rose-colored tunics and a rose-colored cloak, and he was the most handsome of people in them. Al-Mutawakkil began giving Shafi' piece after piece of that amber, saying: 'Give it to Husayn,' and squeezing his hand so he would do that. The last thing he gave him was a red rose with which he greeted him. He [Husayn] recited saying: 'And like the white rose, he greeted with a red... rose, moving in robes like the rose. He has playful gestures at every greeting... with his palms, inviting the empty-hearted to passion. I wished to be given a drink by his palms... reminding me of what I had forgotten of the covenant. May Allah water a time in which I did not spend a night... of time except upon a promise from a beloved.' Al-Mutawakkil ordered that he give him drink, and said: 'We have given you your wish.' Husayn used to drink with Salih bin al-Rashid. He drank with him once in a picnic spot in Babbari, which is one of the districts of Kalwadh. He had there a beautiful, majestic garden, its wall and traces remaining until now. He said describing the garden and their morning drink in it—and it is of his beautiful poetry: 'Did he not whisper to you with eloquent gaze... and groan to you from a wounded heart? I wish you, when you abandon him out of harm... would bestow upon him a restful death. In your beauty was the first good opinion of mine... Does your beauty not forbid you from ugliness? He does not cease accusing my advice... with myself, the soul of an accused advisor. I love the shade of the palms of Babbari... and its pavilion built with tin. And the swaying of its two thickets pleases me... towards me with the scent of calendula and wormwood. And I will not forget the wrestling places of the drunks... and the wailing of the dove on the acacias. And a cup in the right hand of a king's confederate... whose attributes are adorned by the blaze of praise. Pure wine, I loved a pure one... and does the pure one fault the pure? O Amr, do you have a desire for the morning drink... come to the friend of every soul. He stood upon the weakness of his eyes... and chained [the wine] with the Saniḥ and the Bariḥ [omens]. And he followed a drunkenness that passed with another... and left sobriety for the stingy misery.' Amr bin Bana mentioned, saying: We were with Salih bin al-Rashid in this garden of his, and with us was Al-Husayn bin al-Dahhak. Around us was a great amount of narcissus, and the moon had risen over the trees and blossoms. Our time was of the best time seen. A servant of Salih whom he loved was serving him drink. He said to Al-Husayn: 'Say something in this gathering of ours that Ibn Bana can sing.' He pointed to the servant and said: 'The moon described the beauty of your face until... I thought that I, while not seeing you, see you. And when the fresh narcissus breathed... I imagined it the breeze of your scent. Deceptions of wishes distracting me with you... by the radiance of this and the joy of that. I will surely continue as long as I live on affection... for this and that since they resembled you.' Amr said: 'So I sang it. And the pleasantest and best time passed for us!' Al-Husayn bin al-Dahhak said: I was sitting in my house on the day of Washk (a fast day?), and Al-Ma'mun had broken the fast and ordered the people to break the fast. A note came to me from Al-Hasan bin Raja, saying in it: 'I shook you for the morning drink, as the Commander of the Faithful has forbidden me... from fasting. And I have ten of the daughters of Karkh [wine/girls]... with whom the shaking of wine is pleasant. And from the likes of them, if we get drunk... you see us harvesting the fruit of the forbidden. So be the answer, for there is nothing... more beloved to me than omitting speech.' His note reached me, and Muhammad bin al-Harith bin Biskhannar had sent me a boy of his, clean-faced, whom he favored, and with him three peer boys of beautiful faces, and an open note whose bottom was sealed like decrees, in it: 'Go in the name of Allah, O more beautiful... than a branch of silver. Among three of the sons of the Romans... to the house of Husayn. Send the old man to your master... O cool of my eye. Show him violence if he rebels... and demand a debt from him. And leave words and address him... with the wink of eyebrows. And beware returning from your direction... with the boots of Hunayn [empty-handed].' So I went with the boy of Ibn al-Harith, and left going to Al-Hasan. \n\n**Dayr Quta (Monastery of Quta)**",

    "text": "This monastery is in Al-Baradan, on the bank of the Tigris. Between Al-Baradan and Baghdad are continuous gardens and successive parks. From it to Balshakar, then to Al-Muhammadiyya, then to Al-Tuluni al-Saghir, then to Al-Tuluni al-Kabir, then to Al-Baradan. All of that is gardens, vineyards, trees, and palm trees. Al-Baradan is among the beautiful places, pleasant spots, and described locations. It has many visitors and picnickers. This monastery is in it. It combines many conditions, among them: the population of the town, the abundance of its fruits, and the availability of everything needed in it. Also, wine is freely available there, and taverns are many. Also, in this place is what the people of idleness and licentiousness seek of beautiful faces and pleasant, refreshing spots, so it is hardly ever empty. Abdullah bin al-Abbas bin al-Fadl bin al-Rabi' has [poetry] in it: 'O Dayr Quta, you have stirred in me a delight... that removed from my heart sorrows and distress. How many a night in you I continued joy in it... when I connected the rounds and selections for it. Among youths who spent in revelry what they owned... and spent in youthful passion money and property. And a fawn to whom my eye saw no likeness... among people, neither Persians of them nor Arabs. If he appeared approaching, I called out: O joy!... And if he passed turning away, I called out: O war! I stayed in the monastery until it became a home for me... for his sake, and I wore the hairshirt and the cross. Its deacon became a companion and brother to me... and its priest became a father and dad to me. A gazelle, whose glances are swords against lovers... so whoever approaches him deceived, he strikes with them. If I ask him for union, he shows cruelty and withdraws... or if I ask him for sympathy, he turns away rejecting and refuses. And if I complain to him of the length of his migration... and what I encounter of his distancing, he frowns. By Allah, if he asked me for my soul, I would give it generously... and I would not be stingy with him regarding what he asked.' This Abdullah was among the witty literati, a man of ghazal and licentiousness, frequently throwing himself into monasteries and taverns, and following the people of amusement and debauchery! He has beautiful poetry which is sung, and he also sings his own and others'. Muhammad bin Abdul Malik al-Zayyat said to him one day: 'Recite to me some of your poetry.' He said: 'And what is the worth of my poetry, O Vizier?' He said: 'Are you not the one who says: \"And a fawn aimed, when he passed... on Palm Sunday, at my killing. He says to me: How have you become?... How does the likes of me become?\" Whoever says this, says what is the worth of my poetry?' He said: Abdullah fell in love with Asalij, the slave girl of his aunt Ruqayya. Badhl the Elder said to him: 'Show me Asalij, so I either excuse you or blame you!' He said: So he invited her to his house, and Badhl attended. Asalij began and sang: 'Have you betrayed my covenant in absence, so why do you... show the boldness of one adhering to the covenant? Connect and do the deed of one bold in his union... otherwise, turn away and do the deed of one turning away.' She brought every beautiful thing in it. He said to Badhl: 'How do you see, O my lady?' Asalij cut the singing and said: 'O Abdullah, you consult about me? By Allah, I did not consult about you when I loved you!' Badhl shouted and said: 'Yes! You did well, by Allah, O girl! Even if you did not do anything well and had no praiseworthy trait, you deserve to be loved for this word. You did well, by Allah!' Then she said: 'You did well, by Allah, O Abdullah, I excuse you!' From Abdullah's poetry: 'Give me wine, I have cast off restraint... and bore regarding you \"he said\" and \"it was said\" (gossip). Give me the expeller of worries and do not mix... of it in the morning except a little.' From his poetry: 'O hail to my day at Al-Daliyah... we drink it Qufsiyya (from Qufs), pure. With every chief wasting his money... no remainder remains for him in the world. So take from the world and its pleasures... for we are but borrowed in it.' He said: Abdullah wrote to a friend of his inviting him: 'May I be your ransom, I and a pen, and you know!' Abdullah used to love a Christian slave girl and was mad about her. He has regarding her: 'An image in a church tempted us... May Allah tempt the one who painted her. The engraver increased in beautifying her... that when he fashioned her, he made her Christian.' He has a melody in it. Masabih, the slave girl of Al-Ahdab the Barber, used to sing this song, and sing much of his poetry. She was the best narrator of it and most knowledgeable of singing it. She was described with beauty and proficiency. Abdullah loved her. Among what she sang of Abdullah's poetry:",

    "text": "'Do give me a morning drink on Palm Sunday... of a coffee-colored wine aged in Karkh. At the place of people whom my heart is fond of... even if they follow a religion other than my religion.' For Abdullah regarding Masabih—and he had said this poetry and sung it while she was present, so she took it from him, and Mutayyam al-Hashimiya also sang it: 'Indeed I loved an enemy... so may God water my enemy. I ransomed her with my relatives... and my family and my neighbors. She was braided like the braiding of bamboo... and bent so she swayed. And she became certain that the heart... loves her, so she acted boldly.' He said: Masabih got angry with Abdullah bin al-Abbas over something she heard about him. He tried to please her, but she refused. He wrote her a note, swearing in it that he did not do anything of what she denied, and invoking against the wrongdoer. She did not answer him anything of what he wrote, but signed under the invocation: 'Against the wrongdoer. Amen.' She did not add to that. He wrote to her: 'As for my joy with the answer... it will not perish as long as we remain. And the most secret letter in it to me is... Amen, Lord of the Worlds.' From his poetry: 'Gold in gold circulated... by a branch of silver. So a delight of an eye came... in the hand of a delight of an eye. A moon carrying a sun... welcome to the two luminaries. A thousand intoxications, two thousand... together, combined. May no bird of separation run between me... nor between them. Rather we remained as long as we remained... forever embracing. In morning drink and evening drink... we did not sell cash for credit.' \n\n**Dayr Mar Jarjis (Monastery of St. George)**\nThis monastery is in Al-Mazrafah. It is one of the monasteries and intended places. Picnickers from the people of Baghdad always go out to it in Sumerians, due to its proximity and goodness. It is on the bank of the Tigris. The waterwheels are before it, gardens surround it, and taverns neighbor it. Everything picnickers need is present in it. Al-Mazrafah is among the best populated lands and most pleasant spots, having gardens that no other land has. Abu Jafna al-Qurashi has [poetry] in it—he was of the dissolute, addicted to drinking, throwing himself into monasteries and taverns. He was never without beardless boys, some serving him and some singing to him: 'The birds trilled after their silence... and the cold retreated in its reins. And the rose and spring flower approached... a time of revelry walking with its rope. How good is union if I escape, so... her abandonment does not sting me with its venom. And like the color of blood, pure wine... goes with a man above his ambition. I contended for it with one whose warp is always... in love and debauchery like his woof. In Dayr Mar Jarjis, when the dawn... wafted upon us the spirits of its flower. I want from him, and nothing prevents me... from that thing except his shyness. He fulfilled his promise and his visit... and I was most fulfilling to him in his covenant.' From his beautiful poetry: 'And a groom seeking the morning drink, and I am... a youth whom the morning drink suits early. I knocked pure wines with the water of a cloud... so they produced joy when I knocked them. I drank then gave him drink, as if... I poured camphor over his uvula. And a youth circulating to you in his delights... a wine that generates languor in the bones. And if your lips sipped its saliva... the wine wrote light on your beautiful face. I did not cease drinking it and giving my companion drink... until I saw his tongue broken. From what the merchants selected in Babylon... or what the Jews aged in Sura.' He has: 'And one of turned-away face, the like of whom people have not seen... I circulated the cup to him when he got angry. He blames me if I seek a kiss on the cheek... and turns away from me whenever I say: Welcome. Were it not for what shakes under his waist-wrapper... I would have stung him from me, when he turned away, a scorpion. I circulated to him a Babylonian coffee-colored wine... showing you its potency on the cup as a star. When the cupbearer mixed it with water, it donned... over the mix a shirt of gilded pearls.' Al-Numayri has [poetry] in it: 'I stayed at Mar Jarjis, the best dwelling... I remembered in it days of amusement that passed for me. Joy encompassed us in it and surrounded us... so from below joy comes and from above. Time made peace in it and aided... and the vicissitudes of accidents stood aside. A belted gazelle circulates the cup to us... urging its cups, not falling short. O life, how pure! And O amusement, last for us... and O arrival of pleasures, you are greeted, so dismount.'",

    "text": "He is Abu al-Tayyib, Muhammad bin al-Qasim al-Numayri. He was of the people of literature and virtue, with beautiful poetry and a delicate nature. He had status and wealth. He used to drink frequently in monasteries and taverns, finding pleasure in that. Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz used to be familiar with him and not leave him. There were correspondences, poetic contests, and pleasant banter between them. We mention some of it: Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz said: Al-Numayri wrote to me one day, after I had invited him: 'I saw you inviting me to drink late... and cutting off the drink from me while the night is enjoyable. So either you drink wine all your night... or you drink wine while the sun is shining. Whichever you prefer, I fulfill its right... and that which you desire is a dissolute drink.' He said: I wrote to him on a feast day, and he had not come to me that day: 'By my father, has something become sweet in your eye... that consoled you, O my friend, after me? The taste of my cup is bitter if you do not visit me... and it is sweet if I see you with me.' He wrote to me: 'My master, you did not want me, so what is... my trick since I am afflicted by rejection from you? Allah knows what I endure of my longing... and my heartbreak and grief at my distance.' Abdullah said: I wrote to him once inviting him, and he wrote to me: 'I have people, and perhaps I can get rid of them.' He suspended the promise. I wrote to him: 'O you who delay my promise... if you wished you would come at its time. So fall upon us a falling... and do not flutter for his treachery. For if I seize your two legs... after this time... I will imprison you with me... upon harm and injury.' Abdullah said: Al-Numayri wrote to me at the end of Sha'ban: 'O Abu al-Abbas, Sha'ban has tucked up... his waist-wrapper. And went striving so no human... catches his dust. So go early, let us drink the purity of the jar... and rob it of its dignity. And if reason is mentioned... we drink to its memory.' He said: He wrote to me, when our meeting was delayed: 'With you, death in company is better... than life in loneliness and isolation. Inform me of their meeting on this day of theirs... and they monopolized against me in the appointment. And Al-Hariri is their head, and sufficient for me... is Al-Hariri as the head of every corruption. If he sees a singing girl, he is moved to passion... and loosens his wing for mounting. And he addresses her and moves his sides... and she pleases the desire of the children.' I apologized to him and asked him to come to us, so he came. Abdullah said: He wrote to me: 'If I am absent I am not sought, and if I come I am not connected... and I am more deserving of blame but I am not blaming. I will endure the excruciating longing hating it... and watch for a good day in the consequences. Not everyone you accompanied is like Qasim... so measure him and think about the path of those who went.' He said: He wrote to me on a Thursday I was fasting: 'Abu al-Abbas, O best of mankind... you fast, and this is not a day of fasting. Do you have a desire for the wine of a witty brother... who helps in the lawful and the forbidden?' He said: Al-Numayri wrote to me, finding my messenger slow and apologizing for his delay from me, mentioning that he was busy cultivating his garden. I answered him: 'As for what you mentioned of my messenger's delay from you to ask about your news in these days and check on you, I saw you turned the sayer's saying: \"Catch the thief before he catches you!\" Otherwise, I did not fall short in asking about you and sending to you. But what do I say to one whose sick friend relapsed and he did not visit him? And he missed him but did not visit him? Busy knocking on taverns and monasteries, riding Zallals (boats), flirting with singing girls, and drinking the daughter of the jars, combining the two ends of his day with an evening drink whose night-talkers do not calm, and a morning drink whose early risers do not slacken, in two armies of amusement: one beating the water with its oars, and another striking the earth with its trot and gallop. You asked about my news in these rains; what can I say about the favor for which thanks is obligatory to Allah Almighty, as it skipped us after it drew its sword and we feared its injustice.' Abdullah said: Al-Numayri wrote to me: 'An Emir I used to hope for my time... if it struck with a grave matter.",

    "text": "I fell ill, but he did not visit me in my illness... and wandered away from visiting and the messenger. I have no need calling for what... I humiliate myself for to the possessor of nobility who gives. Nor to one crowned with kingship who is proud... when I am content with little.' So I wrote him a note, at the end of it: 'In every day obedience and disobedience... and boredom and flattery and abandonment. Characters as if they are ghouls.' He said: I invited him for a day I named, but my messenger was late to him, so he wrote to me: 'You invited us then changed your mind... fuck in his ass whoever is loyal to you.' He said: Al-Numayri wrote to me: 'Longing to drink has exhausted me... with a master who flees from my proximity. I did not know him to be harsh... but he began shunning me without sin. By Allah, I know no sin for me with him... except excess in love. And that I never displeased him for an hour... in present seriousness or play.' He wrote to him: 'O you who shun and is shunned... your accusation is not of wit. You and longing for us are like one who... believes in Allah on an edge. You erased your traces from our affection... except your legends in the pages. And if you took upon yourself a visit to us... one day, you bore it with weakness.' He said, and he wrote to me: 'I came to you happy, so drinking was pleasant for me... and the eye and heart attained their wish with you. But the Cup was unjust to me so I abandoned it... three days as the sin required.' I wrote to him: 'Why did you abandon the Cup when its rule was unjust... and there is no amusement unless you are, so what is the sin? May Allah perpetuate joy for you and perpetuate for me... life and comfort through you, and may closeness connect.' Abdullah said: Al-Numayri sent a messenger to me on Friday, and I said to him: 'Ride with us to the prayer.' The messenger found him having taken a morning drink. He said to him: 'Tell him: I have been praying since the morning prayer.' I wrote to him: 'O you who prays a prayer... in which is obedience to Iblis. If you accept my thanks... then thanks in this is shamelessness!' He said: I wrote to him when I was ill, and he did not visit me: 'Praise be to Allah, even you shun me... after purity, a shunning not little. I was expecting this so you brought it... and no creation is safe from treachery.' He wrote apologizing with a business of his and the illness of his mount. I wrote to him: 'Do not apologize! We have known... you will do your deed. You mentioned a business, so why not... make me some of your business? Or did you not have a donkey... so you could ride your sandals?' He said: He wrote to me: 'If I committed a sin... I have trusted in your grace. I have come to you walking... as you decreed with your justice.' And he came to me walking. Al-Numayri said: Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz used to criticize love greatly, to the point of saying: 'It is a side of stupidity.' If he saw one of us looking down or thinking, he accused him of this meaning and said: 'You have fallen, O So-and-so, and your mind has diminished and you have become foolish!' Until we saw him struck by severe absent-mindedness and constant thought, until verses began to slip from him about the meaning of love. Once he says: 'Love captured a prince... who was not a captive before. So have mercy on the humiliation of a mighty one... who became a slave seeking refuge.' And once he says: 'The mind of the lover is absent-minded... in his heart are calamities.' I said: 'May Allah make me your ransom! These are things you used to criticize the likes of from us, and we now deny them from you!' He returns feigning, but it is not long before a slip slips from him. He said once: 'Maktum, O most beautiful of Allah's creation... do not leave me like this, by Allah.' Then he sighed. I said: 'Love has won over Abdullah... and the veil is torn, praise be to Allah.' So say to him: Name to us, by Allah... this one whom you love, by the right of Allah! He laughed and said: 'No, and no honor.' I wrote to him the next day: 'His eye wept and he complained of a burning... from passion in the heart that does not extinguish. I said to him: My master, what is it... I see in you? He said: A hidden illness. I said: Is it love? He said: Limit yourself... to what you see; does it not suffice?' He wrote to me: 'O you who talks about me... with the suspicion of hearing and eye. If you are seeking my secret... then return with the boots of Hunayn.' I wrote to him: 'Far be it, your luck, by Allah... is that you reveal your love.",

    "text": "'Leave the boots of Hunayn... and strive to untie your saliva [speak]. Come let us scheme in what... you desire, with my gentleness and your gentleness.' Then I went to him. He told me his story, so I strove for him with gentle strategy, and he aided me with firm opinion, until he won the victory and attained the desire. \n\n**Dayr Bashahra**\nThis monastery is on the bank of the Tigris, between Samarra and Baghdad. It is a beautiful, populated, pleasant monastery, with many gardens and vineyards. It is one of the intended places and famous monasteries. Those descending from Surra Man Ra'a (Samarra) and those ascending to it stay there. Whoever makes it a way station spends the night there and stays if it pleases him. Whoever intends it stays for days in the most delicious and good life, and the most beautiful and pleasant place! Abu al-Ayna' has [poetry] in it; he had stayed there, remained for days, found it pleasant, and said about it: 'We stayed at Dayr Bashahra... upon its priest, at noon. Upon the religion of Jesus... so he did not give a legal opinion nor keep a secret. He bestowed beautiful action... that enslaves the free. He gave us drink and quenched us... from the pure virgin [wine]. The time was pleasant in the monastery... so we garrisoned in it for ten [days]. We were given the sun to drink... and served by the moon. The pleasure of the cup revived... but killed with drunkenness. We attained all we desired... of our pleasures, openly. We engaged in youthful passion, sang... and spiteed time with it. We fucked, and were dissolute... and the likes of me tore the veil. Our Lord helped us... willingly from Him, not by force. May Allah reward him for good... with which we met good. I extended thanks to him... as he extended kindness.' Abu al-Ayna' was among the witty. Al-Mutawakkil used to admire his speech, quick answers, and anecdotes. He went blind at the age of forty. Indicating that is the saying of Abu Ali al-Basir about him: 'I had feared the hand of time... upon you when sight went. I did not know that by blindness... you become rich and mankind becomes poor.' He had good poetry, good improvisation, beautiful writing and epistolary style, and a sharp tongue in insulting people and alluding to them. We mention a part of his news, in an amount that does not lead to lengthiness, nor violates the condition. Al-Mutawakkil said to Abu al-Ayna': 'What is the hardest thing you passed through in the loss of your sight?' He said: 'Missing seeing you, O Commander of the Faithful, given the consensus of people on your beauty.' He said to him one day: 'O Muhammad, how long will you praise people and blame them?' He said: 'As long as they do evil and do good.' Ubaydullah bin Sulayman said to him: 'We have ordered something for you at this time, so take it and excuse.' He said: 'I will not, O Vizier! If you apologize in calamity, and apologize in power, when will you not apologize?' He asked Sa'id bin Makhlad for a letter to write for him to Egypt. He began saying: 'To Egypt, O Abu al-Ayna', to Egypt?' He said: 'And why do you consider Egypt far for me, may Allah honor you? By Allah! Reaching what is in your chests is farther for me than what is in Egypt!' He entered upon Abu al-Saqr, who brought him near and seated him close. He said: 'O Vizier! Bringing the friend close and depriving the enemy!' He entered upon him one day. He [Abu al-Saqr] said: 'What delayed you from us, Abu Abdullah?' He said: 'My donkey was stolen!' He said: 'And how was it stolen?' He said: 'I was not with the thief to know how he stole it!' Then he came to him after a period. He said: 'What delayed you from us, Abu Abdullah?' He said: 'From obstacles and the humiliation of the muleteer.' So he ordered fifty dinars for him. He said: Abu al-Ayna' entered one day upon Muhammad bin Abdul Malik al-Zayyat, who did not raise his glance to him nor speak to him! He said: 'Indeed, part of the right of Allah's blessing upon you, when He qualified you for the state you are in, is that you make openness to those in need of you a character trait. For he who is lonely withdraws from asking. By frequent asking with success, joy lasts, and by fulfilling needs, blessings last.' Muhammad said to him: 'I know you as a meddler, talking much. Do you think the length of your tongue prevents your discipline if you slip?' And he ordered him to prison! Abu al-Ayna' wrote to him from prison: 'I knew that the imprisonment was not for a sin that preceded from me, but you loved to show me your power over me, because everything new is enjoyed. There is no harm if you show us of your pardon what you showed us of your power!' So he ordered his release. He met him after a long time on the road. Muhammad stopped his beast and said: 'I do not see you, Abu Abdullah, connecting with us according to our saving of you!' Abu al-Ayna' said: 'As for the knowledge of your care, it is confirmed. But I reckon that what renewed your finding me slow is the emptiness of your prison of those in it, so you wanted to populate it with me!'",

    "text": "He said: He entered one day upon a man who had been removed from a position he held. He said: 'If the blessing was ugly on you, the vengeance has been beautiful on you!' He said: 'Why is that?' He said: 'Because I asked you less than your capability, and you rejected me with uglier than your face.' Then he said: 'Say to Zayd bin Sa'id... Removal came to you with kindness. So swallow the worry and be patient... for upon your Lord is the compensation. You too, if you govern... do not increase in arrogance.' He said: Ibn Badr passed by Abu al-Ayna' while he was sitting at his door. He said: 'Is this your house, Abu Abdullah?' He said: 'Yes! If you wish to see your bad effect in it, dismount!' He said: He passed by the house of Abdullah bin Mansur one day while he was sick and had recovered. He said to his servant: 'What is the news of Abu Muhammad?' He said: 'As you like!' He said: 'Then why do I not hear screaming in the house?' He said: Abu al-Ayna' mentioned Maymun bin Ibrahim, saying: 'If a man contemplated his actions and avoided them, he would dispense with seeking etiquettes!' Abu al-Ayna' said: Muhammad bin Mukram said to me: 'Do you not know me?' I said: 'Yes, but a knowledge I pity you for!' Muhammad bin Mukram said to him one day: 'O Abu Abdullah, everything you have is from people, even your children!' Abu al-Ayna' said: 'I saw Ibn Mukram, and I saw his belly as the belly of a pregnant woman, his soul as the soul of a love-struck woman, his snot as the snot of a bereaved mother, and in his ass is the greatest calamity!' Ibn Mukram said to him one day: 'O Abu Abdullah, are you fasting anything with us this month?'—and it was the month of Ramadan. He said: 'Will the old woman let us fast?' A man said to Ubaydullah bin Sulayman: 'If you see fit, may Allah honor you, to issue a sustenance for me.' He said: 'Who is the man, so the sustenance comes out according to that?' He said: 'From the children of Adam!' Abu al-Ayna' said: 'Preserve, may Allah honor you, this lineage, for its origin has been cut off!' He said: Al-Jahiz and Abu al-Ayna' met at Al-Hasan bin Wahb's. Al-Jahiz said to him: 'I knew that Muhammad bin Abdullah is better than Amr bin Bahr, and Abu Abdullah is better than Abu Uthman. But Al-Jahiz is better than Abu al-Ayna'.' Abu al-Ayna' said: 'Far from it! You came to what is hidden of our affairs and preferred me over yourself in it, and to what is known, and preferred yourself in it. Abu al-Ayna' indicates a kunya (nickname), and Al-Jahiz indicates a defect (bulging eyes)! The kunya, even if ugly, is better than the defect, even if successful!' Abu al-Ayna' said: A woman in Basra fell in love with me without seeing me, but she used to hear the sweetness of my speech. When she saw me, she found me ugly and said: 'May Allah make him ugly, is this him?' So I wrote to her: 'And I was told, when she saw me, she denied... and said: Ugly, cross-eyed, he has no body. If you deny from me cross-eyedness, indeed I am... literary, intelligent, neither inarticulate nor stupid.' She signed on the note: 'O biter of his mother's clitoris, did I want you for the Bureau of Correspondence?' Abu al-Ayna' has about Ali bin al-Jahm: 'Ali wanted to say a poem... in praise of the Commander of the Faithful, so he called the Adhan. I said to him: Do not hasten with Iqama... for I am not in a state of purity. He said: Nor am I.' Abu al-Ayna' said: I came to Abdullah bin Dawud al-Khuraybi and asked him to narrate [Hadith] to me. He considered me too young and said: 'Go and memorize the Quran.' I said: 'I have memorized it.' He said: 'Read from the beginning of the sixties of Yunus.' I read the ten. He said: 'You did well. Go and learn the laws of inheritance.' I said: 'I have memorized them.' He said: 'So which is closer to you: your uncle or your nephew?' I said: 'My nephew.' He said: 'Why is that?' I said: 'Because this one is from my father's children, and this one is from my grandfather's children.' He said: 'You did well. Go and learn Arabic.' I said: 'I have done so and learned of it what is sufficient.' He said: 'So why did Umar bin al-Khattab say'—meaning when he was stabbed—'Ya lillahi, Ya lil-Muslimin (O for Allah, O for the Muslims)?' I said: 'Because the first is a call for help (Istighatha), and the second is a call (Nida).' He said: 'If I were to narrate to anyone of your age, I would narrate to you!'",

    "text": "Abu al-Ayna' said: I entered upon Abu Ahmad Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir. It was a summer day, and people were before him playing chess. He said: 'O Abu Abdullah, we are playing for stakes until our food is ready. In which of the two parties would you like to be?' I said: 'In the Emir's party, may Allah support him, for it is higher and more splendid.' So we lost! Abu Ahmad said: 'O Abu Abdullah, we have lost! And your share [of the loss] is twenty rotls of snow. Bring it, O Emir.' I jumped up and went to Abu al-Abbas bin Thawaba. I conveyed greetings to him from Abu Ahmad and said to him: 'He misses you and wanted to write you a note, but he feared your dodging, so he sent me as a messenger and burdened me with a message, and we will not separate except in his presence!' So he rode with me, and we came. When I stood before him, I said: 'O Emir, I have brought you the mountain of Hamadan as snow, so deduct from it what we gambled, and play with your friends for the rest!' He laughed until he lay on his back! He asked Ibn Thawaba about the story, so he knew the news. When he understood it, he cursed me and left! Abu al-Ayna' said: I entered upon Al-Mutawakkil, prayed for him, and spoke to him. He admired my speech and said to me: 'It reached me that there is evil in you!' I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, if evil is mentioning the doer of good with his goodness and the doer of evil with his evil, then Allah, Glorious and Exalted, has praised and blamed. He said in praise: \"Excellent is the servant, indeed he was repeatedly turning back [to Allah].\" And He said in blame: \"A slanderer, going about with calumnies. A hinderer of the good, transgressor, sinful. Cruel, moreover, and an illegitimate pretender.\" So He blamed, Exalted is His Name. The poet said: \"If I do not praise the one of good constantly... and do not curse the mean, blameworthy coward. Then for what did I know good and evil by name... and why did Allah split for me hearing and a mouth?\" But if evil is like the act of the scorpion that stings the Prophet and the Dhimmi by a nature that does not distinguish, then Allah has protected your servant from that.' He said to me: 'And it reached me that you are a Rafidi (Shia).' I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, and how can I be a Rafidi when my city is Basra, my upbringing in its congregate mosque, my teacher Al-Asma'i, and my neighbors Bahila? People are not devoid of wanting religion or world. If they want religion, the Muslims have agreed on advancing those they delayed and delaying those they advanced. And if they want the world, you and your ancestors are the Commanders of the Faithful; there is no religion except by you and no world except with you. Your father is the desolator of Al-Ayth, and in your hands are the treasuries of the earth, and I am your client.' He said: 'Ibn Sa'dan claimed that about you!' I said: 'And who is Ibn Sa'dan? By Allah, that one does not distinguish between the Imam and the Ma'mum, nor the follower and the followed. That is but a carrier of a stick, a teacher of boys, taking a wage for the Book of Allah.' He said: 'Do not do that, for he is the tutor of Al-Mu'ayyad.' I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, he did not tutor him for free, but tutored him for a wage. If you give him his due, you have fulfilled his right.' Ibn Sa'dan stood up and said: 'O Abu al-Ayna', no, by Allah, the Commander of the Faithful did not speak the truth in anything he narrated about me!' Then he turned to Al-Mutawakkil and said: 'What is easier for you, O Commander of the Faithful, than that your session ends as you like, then this one goes out and tears me apart!' He said: So Al-Mutawakkil laughed. Then he said: 'How is this house of mine?' I said: 'I saw people built their houses in the world, and you put the world in your house!' He said to me: 'What do you say about Ubaydullah bin Yahya?' I said: 'A servant to Allah and to you, divided between His obedience and your service, preferring your satisfaction over every benefit, and what returns with the welfare of your subjects over every pleasure.' He said: 'What do you say about the Postmaster Maymun bin Ibrahim?' He knew that I was angry with him for a shortcoming of his towards me. I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful: A hand that steals and an ass that farts! He is like a Jew who stole half his Jizya; so he has boldness for what he paid, and with it hesitation for what remained. His evil is nature, and his goodness is affectation!' He said: 'I want you to sit with me.' I said: 'I cannot bear that, nor am I strong enough for it. I do not say this out of ignorance of the honor I have in this assembly; but I am a man who is screened. The signal of the screened varies, and your gesture is hidden from him. It is possible for me to speak with the speech of an angry one while your face is pleased, and with the speech of a pleased one while your face is angry. If I do not distinguish between these two, I perish. So I choose safety over exposure to calamity.' He said: 'You spoke the truth! But you must visit us.' I said: 'The obligation of a mandatory duty.' He gave me ten thousand dirhams. He said to me one day, when I entered upon him: 'O Muhammad, no one remained in the assembly but backbit you except me.' I said: 'If the noble of my clan are pleased with me... may their mean ones never cease to be angry with me.' He is Abu Abdullah, Muhammad bin al-Qasim bin Khallad bin Yasir bin Sulayman. His origin is from Yamama, from Banu Hanifa themselves. His residence was in Basra. Then he moved to Baghdad, and went to Surra Man Ra'a, met Al-Mutawakkil, and stayed there.",

    "text": "He had good writing, eloquent speech, beautiful poetry, a tongue loose in blame and complaining, quick answers, and present wit; no one could stand against him. Al-Mutawakkil said: 'I desire to have Abu al-Ayna' as a boon companion were it not that he is blind!' That reached Abu al-Ayna', so he said: 'If the Commander of the Faithful excuses me from sighting the crescents, stringing pearls and rubies, and reading the engravings of rings, then I am suitable for him.' Muhammad bin Mukram screened Abu al-Ayna' [from entering], then wrote apologizing to him. Abu al-Ayna' wrote to him: 'You screen me face-to-face and apologize to me in writing!' His stories are many, but we have presented as much as the book can bear and the condition requires, without driving its reader to boredom. Ibn Mukram wrote to Abu al-Ayna': 'I have Sikbaj that terrifies the madman, and talk that delights the sad one, and your brothers the jokers (Mahazun? Unclear). So do not rise against me and come.' Abu al-Ayna' answered him: 'Be driven into it and do not speak to Me.' [Quran 23:108] \n\n**Dayr al-Khawat (Monastery of the Sisters)**\nThis monastery is in 'Ukbara. It is a large, populated monastery, inhabited by women who became nuns and devoted themselves in it. It is in the middle of gardens and vineyards, well-located, a pleasant place. Its feast is the first Sunday of the Fast (Lent). Everyone near it from Christians and Muslims gathers there; these celebrate and those picnic. In this feast is the Night of Mashush, which is a night where women mix with men; no one restrains his hand from anything, and no one refuses anyone anything. It is one of the mines of drink, abodes of revelry, and places of amusement. Al-Najim Abu Uthman has [poetry] in it: 'Ah, my heart, from passion, ah... from adorned, beautiful maidens. And a girl like a willow branch... with a face like the light of morning. O people of Dayr al-Khawat, by Allah my Lord... is there any sin decreed upon a lover?' This Abu Uthman was the narrator of Ibn al-Rumi. He had beautiful poetry, a gentle nature, and good meanings in describing wine, songs, and love. From his beautiful poetry: 'Circulate, O Salama, the cup of wine... and match with your singing the singing of turtledoves. And take it aged, tangy... pouring upon the night the robe of day. The cheek disputes its color... and gifts it to the eye on the day of hangover.' From his beautiful poetry: 'Salama bin Sa'id... excels in urging the wine. If he sings, we play the reed [Zamr]... upon him with cups.' He has: 'Atib and her lute never spoke... except we intended amusement and joy. She has singing like healing in a body... wasted by long illness and grief. The wine worships her, so when she speaks... our pitcher is prostrating to the cup.' He has: 'Atib and her lute never spoke... except we remained working the wine. Their strings demand worries with strings... so they do not wake up, killing them.' He has, and it has a melody: 'Longing did not call me except... the eye shed tears. I only weep because... I have become a suckling to love. O most beautiful of people and most worthy of... people for beauty, all of them. I do not see for myself, from my beloved... a pulling away for the eternity of time.' \n\n**Dayr al-'Alth (Monastery of al-'Alth)**\nAl-'Alth is a village on the bank of the Tigris, on its eastern side. Before it in the Tigris is a difficult place, a narrow passage with large stones and strong current, where ships pass with difficulty. These places are called Al-Abwab (The Gates). When ships arrive at Al-'Alth, they dock there. Crossing is not possible for them except with a guide from its people whom they hire. He holds the rudder and navigates them through those places, not landing them until he clears them. This monastery overlooks the Tigris. It is one of the best situated monasteries and most pleasant places, intended from every land, and visited by everyone. It is hardly devoid of a descender or ascender. Whoever enters it does not pass it to another due to its goodness, pleasantness, and the availability of everything needed in Al-'Alth and in it. Jahza has [poetry] in it: 'O two sailors, by Allah, strive... and fix for me the sail and the rudders. Make me reach, may you be guided, Al-Baradan... and bring down for me jars from the jars. And turn me to Al-Qabisa then Al-Zahra... perhaps I can relieve the sorrows. And if I stay a full year... then head with me to the vineyards of Awana. And bring me down to an old wine... its Jews have aged it for eras. And lower the sail for me at the monastery in Al-'Alth... perhaps I may associate with the monks.",

    "text": "And gazelles reciting a book of the Gospel... they went early at dawn for an offering. Wearing clothes of haircloth... Allah made willow branches beneath them. Shy, until when the cup circulated... they uncovered throats and crosses. Thin, until I thought it the cheek of one who... exchanged my union for abandonment. Al-Mu'tamid has: 'O length of my night at Fam al-Sulh... I followed my loss with profit. My sorrow for a time of ours that passed... at the Palace, Al-Qatul, and Al-Shalh. At the monastery in Al-'Alth and its monks... between Palm Sunday to Epiphany.' Al-Mu'tamid had good poetry and unmeasured poetry. Perhaps he said verses, some correct and the rest corrupt. He used to give them to singers, who would compose melodies for them, so his defect in scansion and melodies would be hidden except from the elite. Bid'a said: Al-Mu'tamid used to send his poetry to 'Arib to compose melodies for it. She used to say: 'Woe is me! How much shall I sing in the letters A, B, T, Th?' Al-Suli said: Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz recited to me from his measured poetry: 'Praise be to Allah, my Lord... You owned the owner of my heart. So I became a slave to my possession... and he became a master to my love.' From his poetry, when Al-Muwaffaq moved him frequently from place to place: 'I became accustomed to distance and alienation... so every day I tread a soil. And every day I see an event... that brings a distress to my liver. Time is bitter to us in its taste... so we do not see a sweet hour.' This is good poetry, correct in its meaning. From his measured poetry: 'I was afflicted with a fawn like the full moon in beauty... torturing me with types of cruelty. I have two eyes whose tears are abundant... and their sleep is less than loyalty.' Al-Suli mentioned that Al-Muktafi brought out to them scrolls written in gold of Al-Mu'tamid's poetry. Among the measured ones was: 'By Allah, my torment has prolonged... and my concern and my depression. Because of a gazelle from the children of the Yellow (Romans)... who does not care about what is in me. I am fond of his love... and he is fond of avoiding me. And if I say: Connect me... \"No\" was his answer.' It also contained: 'Love hastened with his separation... so in my heart is a burning from it. Possessing my slavery by love... and I am the king of his slavery. The lover only finds rest... if he reveals his love.' Al-Mu'tamid has poetry sung by Shariya, in the Ramal mode: 'I was deliberate in love for a long time... but I did not see a day of joy in love.' And among what she sang of his poetry: 'O soul, woe to you, what is wrong with you... indeed I deny your condition.' And he has: 'I have become unable to repel what... I am subjected to of eclipse and humiliation. The affairs of people proceed without me and... no paucity is felt of me in their mention. If I desire a thing, they turn it away... from me, and say: Here is a cause.' He said: Al-Mu'tamid asked for three hundred dinars to give to 'Arib, who was present with him, but they were not found! So he asked for two hundred dinars, but they were not found! So he wept and said: 'Is it not among the wonders that the likes of me... sees what is little denied to him? And the whole world is taken in his name... yet nothing of that is in his hands! To him wealth is carried from everywhere... yet he is denied some of what is collected for him!' It was, when he delegated affairs to his brother Abu Ahmad (Al-Muwaffaq), and found rest in his sufficiency to undertake them, and his freeing him for amusement, drinking, and play, and abandoning looking into anything of the kingdom's affairs or asking about it, Abu Ahmad coveted, monopolized the command, and dominated the kingdom. Al-Mu'tamid wanted to change the situation after that, but it was difficult and impossible for him, and he was denied. People coveted him when they saw him overcome in his affair and saw neither harm nor benefit in his hand.",

    "text": "Ishaq bin Ruh mentioned that Muflih sent him to Al-Mu'tamid and said: 'Tell him: I have heard Hazar, the Commander of the Faithful's slave girl, and I liked her and wanted to own her; and I saw Badr al-Julnar and I liked him, and wanted to own him. Let the Commander of the Faithful send them to me.' I delivered the message to Al-Mu'tamid after asking his permission. When he heard it, he got angry, tore his clothes, and said: 'Is this how slaves do to masters, forcing them regarding their harems and boys?' He spoke great things. We left, then he returned us having calmed down, and said: 'The likes of Abu Salih is not turned away from his request. I have ordered Hazar to be carried with her clothing, furniture, maids, and all she has. As for Badr al-Julnar, he has fallen into our service and has a place with us. Tell him to aid us by leaving him.' I returned to Muflih and informed him of a part of the first and of the last. He was about to leave for Basra to fight the Leader of the Zanj. He said: 'O Abu Ishaq, Hazar is secured. When we return from this war, we will take Badr al-Julnar from him, whether he wills or refuses.' He went out, was hit by an arrow, and died. Al-Mu'tamid was one of the most generous of the Abbasids. Comparisons were made between him and Al-Musta'in, and it is said no one more generous than them ruled. He was of good management, understanding affairs. When his command was undermined and his opinion overcome, his status diminished among people. Muhammad bin Ubaydullah bin Yahya bin Khaqan said: My father sent me to Al-Mu'tamid for something. He said to me: 'Sit.' I considered that great and returned the matter to me, apologizing that it was not permissible for me. He said to me: 'O Muhammad, your politeness in accepting from me is better than your politeness in opposing me.' He said: Some associates of Musa bin Bugha wronged Muhammad bin Ali the Scribe, known as Badhinjanah. When Musa died, he satirized him, saying: 'Musa the priest of the monastery died... May the Merciful curse Musa. For he was weak... in the piety of Allah, base. So my joy is released and sad... ness has become a prisoner.' This poetry reached Al-Mu'tamid, so he refuted it, saying: 'The best of people, Musa, died... May the Merciful have mercy on Musa. For he was majestic... of high rank, a chief. He released sadness and left... my joy stopped, imprisoned.' From his rejected poetry is his saying: 'What is with me and this love, what is with me... If I could, I would ransom it with my money. And this beloved does not connect with me... So I am in a fight with his abandonment. It appeared to me according to what I see, so I love him... and, by Allah, I was not what appeared to me.' And he has of this art: 'Whoever says I am in love, if they depicted... Love, it would be a foolish man. I go around the roofs and do not see him... as if I am a piebald cat. I wished from my longing for him... to look upon him, so I be a stork. People's love is gathered at me... and their love is distributed upon them.' He said: Al-Radi wrote in his handwriting under these verses: 'None said this poetry except... one ignorant of poetry, a fool. Or an afflicted one with madness... lost of thought, piebald.' From his poetry: 'I wondered at this love, not... is the beloved matched in it. I see you, O unjust one, not wanting me... This, by Allah, is inverted love. You in your beauty are Yusuf... and I in my harm am Jacob. I do not mean Ya'qub al-Saffar... You are Al-Saffar crucified.' He has: 'I loved a human in Kaskar... his face is like the bright moon. When I complained to him of his love... he lowered his head and thought. He is pure gold in his beauty... and he is the red ruby. Whoever guides me to him, has from me... all he wished and estimated. When I thought him obtained in my hand... no doubt he left me and tucked up [ran].' He said: He entered Al-Jawsaq one day and saw a bird, so he hunted it. Al-Muwaffaq said: 'I have not seen anything more beautiful than it, so give it to me, O Commander of the Faithful.' So he gave it to him. When he got it in his hand, it escaped and began clapping its wings and flying. Al-Mu'tamid laughed intensely and said: 'I entered Al-Jawsaq one day... and hunted a piebald bird. Al-Muwaffaq took it from me... and when he took it, it clapped. And flew from him in fear.' He said: When Abu Ahmad left for Basra with the army, and Al-Mu'tamid remained in Surra Man Ra'a, he said: 'Important, important, important, important... and a terrible matter and a cut matter. Is it good that you all go... I sit in the house as if I am a woman? And Emir Abu Ahmad goes... and strikes the drum Kardam Kadam.' He said: A pimple appeared on the foot of Badr his servant. He was informed of that, so he grieved. When it was after dark, he went out to his room visiting him, and said: 'I visited him after dark... for an illness occurring on the foot. I went walking in the darkness... alone, so no creature knew.' And he has: 'Ramadan has come to you with a piercing nose-ring... so sit behind your doors and break [bread]. For our intention is in the garden of Sarhak in it... he eats the meat cold when he slices. And Al-Rathitha and the soldiers with him pounded... and Al-Tal'la' and the red eggshell.' \n\n**Dayr al-Adhara (Monastery of the Virgins)**\nThis monastery is below Al-Hazira, on the bank of the Tigris. It is a beautiful, populated monastery, surrounded by gardens and vineyards, containing everything needed. It is never devoid of a picnicker seeking it for drinking and playing. It is one of the beautiful monasteries, and its spot is one of the pleasant spots. It was named Dayr al-Adhara only because in it are virgin nuns devoted to worship; they are its inhabitants and residents, so the monastery was named after them. Yamut bin al-Mazra' mentioned, from Al-Jahiz, saying: Ibn Faraj al-Tha'labi told me that a group from Banu Tha'labah wanted to cut the road for the Sultan's money. Al-Ma'aniyah came to them and informed them that the Sultan had been warned about them. They marched, then decided to hide. The hooves of horses fell in pursuit of them. When they were safe and the horses passed them, each of them secluded with a slave girl he had who was a virgin. When the priest had finished with them, one of them said regarding that: 'And more sodomitic than a monk claiming... that women are forbidden to him. He forbids a white, slender woman... and a boy suffices him regarding the vulva instead of her. When he walks, he lowers his gaze... but in the monastery at night he has ferocity. Dayr al-Adhara is a scandal for them... and with the thieves is a complete story.' In Baghdad also is a monastery known as Dayr al-Adhara in the Fief of the Christians on the Dajjaj Canal. It was named that because they have a fast of three [days] before the Great Fast (Lent), called the Fast of the Virgins. When the fast ends, they gather at this monastery to worship and draw near. It is a beautiful, pleasant monastery. Ibn al-Mu'tazz has [poetry] in the aforementioned Dayr al-Adhara: 'My friend, rise so we die of drunkenness... in a vintner's tavern, a death without a grave. And drink of a golden Karkhi wine... and pardon the sin of accidents and time. O how many days passed praiseworthy... in Dayr al-Adhara, the cells, and the palace. And how many nights aiding the lover... I dared upon pleasures in them with boldness. My friend, do not seek my success and leave me... for I have no patience against what you blame me for.' Some of them have in it: 'My excuse stood regarding the gazelle of the Monastery of the Christians... when I saw his lovers bewildered. A trial that encompassed creation and over... came their Muslims and Christians.' He said: When Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir went out from Baghdad to Surra Man Ra'a—Al-Mu'tazz having summoned him—he stayed at this monastery. He remained there for two days, found it pleasant, drank in it, then said these verses: 'Do you not see the goodness of our time, O Sa'id... a laughing time and arranged garden. And gardens like robes... every day they have a new dye. As if the anemone in it is a lover... and the chamomile is a love-struck admirer. As if the leaning branches are figures... and the blossoms in them are necklaces. As if the fruits and green leaves... are clothes beneath which are breasts. So give it to me, a wine that relieves from worry... and shows our joy and repeats it. And urge the cup, O Sa'id, for a flute... has urged you to it, and an oud has pulled you. And deflower the virginity of pleasures in Dayr... al-Adhara, perhaps it will not return.' Ubaydullah was among the best of people in literature, poetry, and versatility in all sciences, along with generosity of soul and good character. When Ubaydullah arrived in his mentioned journey to Al-Mu'tazz, he ordered him to stay with him that day, so he stayed. Ubaydullah said: Al-Mu'tazz sent to Shariya to come out. She feigned illness to him. He said: 'I have someone who loves to hear you, and I love that for you and him, and your presence is necessary.' So she came out and sat behind the curtain, then said: 'Were it not for the visitor, we would not have come.' The first song she sang was: 'The dwellings were covered by soft ones... like the curve of the tattoo on the wrist.' Then she sang after it:",

    "text": "Prince Abu Ahmad continues… and he beats the drum with a soft dull sound. It is said that a blister appeared on the foot of Badr, his servant, and when he was informed of this, he became distressed. When the night prayer had passed, he went to his chamber to visit him and said: “I visited him after the night prayer… for a new ailment on his foot. I went walking in the darkness… alone, with no one knowing.” He also said: “Ramadan has come upon you with firmly tied belts… so sit behind your doors. Your jars crackle in the garden of Surhak, wherein… one eats meat cold as it is cut apart, and eats rathitha, jund, daquqa… tallala‘, and the shells of red eggs.”\n\n**The Monastery of the Virgins**: This monastery is below the enclosure, on the bank of the Tigris. It is a fine, thriving monastery surrounded by gardens and vineyards, containing everything one may need. It never lacks a place of recreation sought for drinking and amusement. It is among the beautiful monasteries, and its location is among the pleasant spots. It was named “The Monastery of the Virgins” because it housed devoted young virgins who were its residents; thus it was named after them.\n\nYamūt ibn al-Muzarri‘, quoting al-Jāḥiẓ, said: Ibn Faraj al-Tha‘labī told me that a group of Banu Tha‘lab intended to attack the royal caravan to seize its wealth. Some informants came to them and warned that the ruler had become aware of their plan. They fled and decided to hide, but the sound of horses’ hooves pursuing them reached them. When they felt safe and the riders had passed, each man was alone with a maiden who was with him, a virgin. When the priest finished with them, one of them recited:\n\n“More debauched than a monk who claims… that women are forbidden to him, yet he forbids a fair, slender girl… and finds sufficiency with a boy in place of intercourse. When he walks, he lowers his gaze… and at night in the monastery his desire rages. The Monastery of the Virgins exposes them… and among thieves this is a complete tale.”\n\nThere is also in Baghdad another monastery known as the Monastery of the Virgins, in the Christian district on the River of Chickens. It was named so because they have a fast three days before the Great Fast, called ‘The Fast of the Virgins’. When it ends, they gather at this monastery for worship and devotion. It is a fine and pleasant monastery.\n\nIbn al-Mu‘tazz said regarding the Monastery of the Virgins mentioned earlier:\n\n“My two friends, rise so that we may die of intoxication… in the tavern of a wine seller, a death without a grave. Let us drink from a golden karkhī cup… and overlook the sins of events and time. Oh how many splendid days have passed… in the Monastery of the Virgins, the cloisters, and the palace. And how many joyful nights for the passionate one… where I dared indulge in pleasures upon the bridge. My two friends, do not seek my reformation—leave me… for I have no patience against the blame you cast on me.”\n\nSomeone else said about it:\n\n“My excuse stands firm in the gazelle of the Christian monastery… when I saw the bewildered lovers around him. A temptation that encompassed all creatures… overwhelming both Muslims and Christians.”\n\nIt is said: When ‘Ubayd Allah ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Tahir departed Baghdad for Samarra, having been summoned by al-Mu‘tazz, he stopped at this monastery, stayed there two days, enjoyed it, and drank there. He then recited these verses:\n\n“What do you think of the pleasantness of our time, O Sa‘īd?… A laughing season, and gardens in bloom. Gardens like embroidered garments… each day with new colors. The anemone in them like a passionate lover… and the yellow flowers like a devoted youth. The branches seem like bending forms… and the blossoms like necklaces. The fruits and green leaves… garments beneath which breasts rise. Give me wine that removes sorrow… reveals our joy, and restores it. Urge on the cup, O Sa‘īd, for a flute urges you, and your lute assists. And tear away the virginity of pleasures in the Monastery of the Virgins… for perhaps they will not return.”\n\n‘Ubayd Allah was among the best of people in manners, poetry, and mastery of all knowledge, with generosity and good character. When he arrived at al-Mu‘tazz during that journey, he ordered him to stay with him that day, and he stayed.\n\n‘Ubayd Allah said: Al-Mu‘tazz sent for Shāriyah to come, but she excused herself. He said: “I have someone who wishes to hear you, and I wish it for both you and him. You must come.” So she came and sat behind the curtain, then said: “Had it not been for the visitor, we would not have come.” The first song she performed was:\n\n“I covered the dwellings with gentleness… like the winding of a tattoo on the wrist.”\n\nThen she sang another after it:",

    "text": "'The voice of a dove frightened me for separation... on a willow branch, doves answered it.' Al-Mu'tazz said to me: 'How do you hear?' I said: 'I hear something whose share of wonder is greater than the share of delight.' He approved this speech from me. Then he let me hear the playing of Zanam the Piper, who had become weak, tremulous, and chronically ill with gout. He showed me the instrument made by Ahmad bin Musa the Engineer from copper; water is sent into it, and the playing of the surnay (oboe) is heard from it. Then he took me to a window and ordered the lion and the elephant to be brought together. I saw how they leaped at each other. Then he said to me: 'I remember that I showed you curious things today.' I said: 'Yes, O my master.' He said: 'Which of them is wittiest to you?' I said: 'The singing of Shariya.' He said to me: 'You spoke the truth!' Jahza said: I entered upon Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir one day. Sheikhs came to him, and he ordered them to sit on his right. Middle-aged men came, and he ordered them to sit on his left. Youths entered and stood before him, and he did not order them to sit. I asked him about them. He said: 'These are my sons'—and he pointed to the sheikhs—'and these are their sons'—and he pointed to the middle-aged men—'and these are their sons'—and he pointed to the youths. I said: 'Are your sons from one mother or from various mothers?' He said: 'The mother of all of them is Shaji.' He recited: 'I and Shaji sowed between us in my youth... the plant of love, and it bore sweet fruit. Shaji's sons turned gray while I was alive and matured... and their sons turned gray, and she is the owner of my heart.' He said: 'She has been with me for seventy years. An astrologer had judged my death before her, but she died before me.' So he said: 'O wonder at me and at the one whom I tended... with the strongest causes of love and who tended me. I was hoping to be his ransom... but when the time of death came, he ransomed me.' Ibn Qudama mentioned, saying: I attended Shaji's funeral. When we returned, I entered with Ubaydullah helping and comforting him. He was looking down, tears flowing on his cheeks; I never saw a weeper more beautiful than him. Then he raised his head and turned to us, saying: 'An oath that if I were afflicted by her loss... while I had a pulse of a vein for life and relapse. I would have almost killed myself upon her separation... but she died and my soul has gone.' He said: Then I attended with him to visit her grave. When he intended to leave, he said: 'Whoever visits the abode of loved ones for their life... and is capable of meeting what he hopes for. Let him come to the abode of loved ones who inhabited decay... out of honor and preservation, and the meeting is the Gathering.' He said: A son of Ubaydullah from Shaji died. He visited his grave, then recited: 'O gathering place of loved ones after separation... I see you near, but the meeting is far. O wonder that I visit you compelled... and in you are those I love, and I leave you willingly.' Al-Suli said: When Shaji died, Ubaydullah grieved for her a grief the likes of which was not seen. A group of literati elegized her, and Ubaydullah elegized her with several poems. The best of what passed me in that was a letter from Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz to him and its answer from Ubaydullah bin Abdullah. The text of the consolation was: 'The news of the calamity reached me, may Allah honor you. By Allah, the worry of it has partnered me with you, and what pained you has pained me. So patience, O my brother, upon the decree of fate, rising from the stumble of panic, firmness for the trial, and thanks to the Granter of blessing by sending the harem ahead and obtaining the reward for good patience. Even if she was: Of majestic luck in chastity and piety... and a turtledove cooing at the peak of the branch. She turned away, and even if the earth did not feed other than her... it would have sufficed her, but I do not see the earth satiated. Allah prolonged your enjoyment of her since He gave her to you, and made her loss for your reward which is greater than her since He reclaimed her from you. The likes of you, may Allah support you, is not urged to preserve his religion, because you know it, desire it, and hasten to it. But calamities may storm the anxious one until he remembers or is reminded, so he returns to satisfaction with the judgment of the One who does not wrong, and preempts patience over the calamity by choice, for the solace which he must inevitably come to by necessity. How often a choice is bitter, and praiseworthy in what is disliked. This is Time which we know, and you are not approached from inadvertence regarding it. This is its nature, and thus its custom proceeded, until Allah inherits the earth and whoever is on it, and He is the best of inheritors. Were it not for an illness hindering meeting you, may Allah honor you, I would have come to you instead of every letter and messenger, and fulfilled your right by that and seen it as your due. How often a present one whose affection is not present, and an absent one whose concern is not absent from us. May Allah make your reward great, your recompense abundant, guide your heart to the path of consolation, suffice you your dislikes, grant you success to what agrees with you, have mercy on the one who died, and make what she connected to of the Hereafter better than what she was cut off from of the world. Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we return.'",

    "text": "Ubaydullah bin Abdullah answered him: 'May Allah prolong the survival of the Master hoped for the world and religion, son of the beneficence masters, the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and the noble ancestors. May Allah increase the Master in honor and preference, perpetuate for him glory, happiness, dignity, bliss, and safety, renew for him apparent blessings and successive favors, make me his ransom from every evil and harm, and advance me to every feared and cautioned thing before him. The letter of the Master, may Allah prolong his survival, arrived filled with kindness, virtue, favor, bounty, unique literature, and comprehensive beauties. I received it with its due of reverence, thanks, and knowledge of his high worth, elevated degree, and ascended rank in good composition, agreement of meanings, great correctness, and beautiful address. Allah has raised literature and knowledge and the eyes of their people by the Master, may Allah support him with His care and power. As for sharing, it is known from his kindness, such that even if I said that consolation for this calamity that befell me, had he verbally confronted me with it and consoled for it, the matter would have run its course and placed the intent in its most rightful places. As for patience, it is inevitable, either by necessity or by choice. \"If a calamity strikes a living person... he meets it with endurance and patience. It is not far from turning into a blessing... for which praise and thanks to Allah are due.\" As for panic, what struck, pained, hurt, and frightened, there is no escape from it. If it does not exceed the eye and heart to the body and tongue, its gravity is easier. Thanks to the Master who lightens trials and completes blessings, the refuge in misfortunes and protection in calamities. Even if long enjoyment, may Allah honor the Master, consoles—it consoles from it only for one whom it aided and whose knot it weakened, not for what a distinguishing observer relied upon, even if upon the severest pain, bitterest grief, eternal anguish, and lasting sorrow. I say: \"The most joyful matters of time became its saddest... and every new thing became worn after you. So wonder at honey turning into colocynth... and at a laugher who did not return but remained weeping.\" As for solace, may Allah honor the Master, it is not the act of sincere freemen, neither in life nor in death. It is only seizing the opportunity of reckoning [reward] and continuous earning. I seek refuge in Allah from the loss of consolation and the loss of its reward. By Allah, O my master, the person is humbled, the eye is tearful, and the heart is burning, in pain. This condition encountered a body in which there is no sound limb, prolonged illnesses, and a calamity connected to what remains of time. \"While the youth weeps and mourns his grief... and his familiar one, lo, he becomes wept for and mourned.\" As for what the Master mentioned, may Allah make me his ransom, regarding the matter of the illness—may it not be, nor may mention of it be heard ever—were it not for it, there would have been and been what the tongue cannot unleash mentioning. I seek refuge for him in Allah the Great, who favored him with every noble character, from blaming the action for which the least of it does not suffice the utmost thanks. In what preceded of address and sharing is what reaches the furthest stations of honor and attempts the highest feats of pride. I negotiate with the Master, may Allah prolong his survival, thing after thing of what sadness spoke, and I broadcast it to him. Among that: \"I stopped at the loved ones while the dust is between them... by my soul, faces are under those graves. It was represented to me what decay attained of their beauty... so glory be to my Lord, Knower of secrets.\"' Then he sent him several poems he said about her. He said: When Ubaydullah's condition declined, Al-Mu'tadid sent to him asking him to make room for Shaji to visit him. That was difficult for him, and he argued that she was ill and of disordered appearance. He persisted in asking for her until a threat appeared from him. So he sent her to him. It was mentioned about her that she said: 'I despised myself when I entered upon his slave girls, because of what I saw on them of jewelry and robes. They also despised me until I sang and they sang, so my reverence for them transferred to me from them.' When she left, Al-Mu'tadid loaded with her ten thousand dirhams, clothing, and perfume. Shaji and Ubaydullah's family came. When he saw her, he was relieved. Then he said to her: 'Did you see anything you haven't seen the like of with us and admired?' She said: 'No, by Allah, except an oud of wood (aloeswood/singular piece?), which is carved, not built; I found it novel.' Jahza said: What do you say about one who enters the Caliphate house and does not extend his eye to anything admiring it except an oud? He said: Among what she composed and sang that day for Al-Mu'tadid was: 'What did beauty borrow from his face... and the soft branch from his stature. We reproached each other with our eyes... regarding what the breach of his promise committed. Until we wounded each other by our repeating... of the glance in my heart and in his cheek. So he took revenge and I took revenge... and his turning away from his rejection pleased me.' Among what she sang also:",

    "text": "'It is Time, it gives you only distraction... and takes the gifted only by force. Solace when the demand of a perished one is missed... and patience if practicing patience is more prudent.' Abu Ali Muhammad bin al-Ala al-Shajari said: When Ubaydullah bin Sulayman assumed the vizierate for Al-Mu'tadid, Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir gave me a note, asking me to show it to Ubaydullah bin Sulayman. In it was: 'Our time refused to aid us regarding ourselves... but aided us regarding whom we revere and honor. So I said to it: Your favors upon them, complete them... and leave our matter, for the important is prioritized.' Ubaydullah bin Sulayman admired what he wrote and said: 'Do you not see how he was gentle in complaining of his condition?' Then he took all his notes and signed for him in them with everything he wanted. He said: Abu al-Ayna' said one day to Ubaydullah: 'Shall I be silent, O Emir, or speak?' He said: 'If you are silent, you suffice; and if you speak, I listen to you. Indeed, you settle with us when we need you, and distance from us when you need us.' From his poetry is his saying: 'By my life, if I told myself that... I would miss you, my opinion would be far astray. Because you are to me in the place encompassing me... of the earth wherever doctrines roused me.' Abu Ali al-Awaraji mentioned that Abu Bakr Muhammad bin al-Sari al-Sarraj the Grammarian loved a slave girl from the singers, and spent a large amount of money on her. When Al-Muktafi arrived from Raqqa, people went out to look at him. I, he, and Abu al-Qasim Abdullah al-Mawsili went out and sat on the balcony of Ibn Jahshiyar's house to see him. When he arrived and we looked at him, we all admired him. Abu Bakr bin al-Sarraj was angry with this slave girl and quarreling with her. He said: 'Something has come to me, so write.' So I wrote: 'I compared between her beauty and her deeds... and behold, beauty does not fulfill [balance] treachery. By Allah, I will not speak to her even if she were... like the sun or like the moon or like Al-Muktafi.' Then a long time passed for the story. Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ismail Zanjy the Writer loved a singing girl. He was then writing for Abu al-Abbas Ibn al-Furat, and used to tell him his story with her without being shy. His meeting with her was every Friday, because it was the day of his turn in his house. Abu Ali said: Zanjy told me, saying: I went early on Saturday to Abu al-Abbas Ibn al-Furat. He said to me: 'What was your news yesterday?' I told him of our meeting. He said to me: 'So what was your song [you heard]?' I said: 'I compared between her beauty and her deeds...' Abu al-Abbas said to me: 'Whose poetry is this?' I said: 'Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz.' Then Abu al-Abbas Ibn al-Furat rode to the Vizier Al-Qasim bin Ubaydullah, told him this story, recited the poetry to him, and went with him to Al-Thurayya, then left him and sat in his office. When he knew his departure was near, he went out and met him. When he met him, he told him that he recited the poetry to Al-Muktafi and that he asked him about its sayer, so he informed him it was Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir. He said: 'So he ordered me to carry one thousand dinars to him. I said: I only told you that the poetry is Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz's, so you attributed it to Ibn Tahir. He said: By Allah, it only occurred to me that you said it was Ubaydullah's. This is a provision Allah provided to Ubaydullah, no one has a trick in it.' Zanjy said: When Abu al-Abbas left, he told me this story and said: 'You take the dinars and go with them to Ubaydullah and say to him: This is a provision Allah sent to you from where you did not reckon!' I carried the dinars to him and told him the story. He praised Allah and thanked Abu al-Abbas. This was of amazing coincidence! Ubaydullah used to say: 'Whoever accompanies the Sultan and serves him needs to enter blind and leave mute.' From his poetry is his saying: 'If you do not favor the one of affection... and you and he are in an equal position. Then do not be haughty over him, for... a youth is punished for the sin, not for the satisfaction.' He also said: 'Indeed my heart, from you after what passed... is full of two different matters. A love from you followed by harm to you, and harm... is the enemy of love; they will never be found in a place.' He also said: 'Suffice you of the lowly world as informant... the richness of its misers and the poverty of its nobles. And that the men of benefit are under its soles... and the men of harm are upon its humps.' He also said: 'And they said: Tomorrow he departs, so what are you doing? ... It is nothing but the eyes overflowing. Nay, sighs between which is breathing... cutting my heart, and worries are pullers.",

    "text": "'And humiliation, looking down, thought, and heartbreak... and greater than them is what the ribs conceal.' Abdullah bin al-Mu'tazz said: I wrote to Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir when his son was appointed to the deputy of Yunus over the police of Baghdad: 'I rejoiced at what multiples of it are below your worth... and I said perhaps Time has woken from its sleep. So a Tahirid dynasty returns among us... as it began, and the command after it is the command. Perhaps Allah, for Allah is not heedless... and there must be ease when hardship ends.' Ubaydullah bin Abdullah answered him: 'So we are for you if the injustice of harshness touches us... and from us upon its hardships is patience and excuse. If a dynasty returns from Allah's blessing... to us, then from us at that is praise and thanks.' Ubaydullah has much poetry and interesting news; we selected from it what befits the purpose of the book and does not exit to the limit of lengthiness. The death of Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir was on Saturday night, twelve nights passed of Shawwal, year three hundred. When he died, Shaghab, the mother of Al-Muqtadir Billah, sent Umm Musa the Stewardess to his children and harem, consoled them for him, shrouded him with a Hahiri shroud, gave charity in his funeral of one thousand dinars and one thousand dirhams, and undertook all their affairs. As for his brother Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir, he was generous, noble, bounteous, tolerant, of good character, with literature, good knowledge, mastery in all sciences, control, politics, and advancement in management. Al-Mutawakkil had summoned him from Khurasan when Ishaq bin Ibrahim al-Tahiri and his son Muhammad died, and appointed him his deputy in Baghdad. He confirmed his brother Tahir bin Abdullah over Khurasan, and he was the eldest of his brothers. Al-Shah bin Mikal mentioned that a cloth merchant offered Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir two robes of embroidery. He recognized them and knew they were from his clothes. He summoned Ibrahim bin Harun the Christian, his steward, and ordered him to bring the two robes whose description was such and such. He mentioned he did not know them, and that he returned to the inventory and did not find them in it, and returned to the register and found them established in it, bought for one thousand five hundred dinars. He said: I asked about the news, and was informed that the scribe in the treasury sold them and dropped their number from the inventory. He ordered the imprisonment of the scribe. He said to Ibrahim: 'Woe to you! Do you employ as a scribe one who dares such daring?' He swore he did not know such a condition from him nor knew such a slip for him. He said: 'If the matter is so, let him be released.' He ordered five hundred dinars for him and said to him: 'Be chaste with this, for I think poverty drove you to that. Return the two robes to the merchant and release him.' He said: We were one day at Ishaq bin Ibrahim bin Mus'ab's. The table was presented. He had ordered Harisa to be made. The Harisa was presented to him. He looked at it and saw a hair. He signaled to some of his servants something we did not understand. It was not long before he came with a tray with a cover. He placed it and lifted the cover. Behold, the hand of the cook with its blood in the tray. We lifted our hands, and our eating was spoiled by what came upon us. We stood up, and none of us could benefit himself. Then we gathered ages later at the table of Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir. He had ordered the preparation of a dish he desired. It was made for him, and the cook brought it himself, eager to get close to his heart. When he neared him, he stumbled in his haste, and the tray slipped onto Muhammad. His clothes and the carpet under him became a mess. He stood up immediately, changed his clothes, washed, and returned to us with a cheerful face, unaffected by what happened. He sat at the table, then said: 'Bring me So-and-so the cook.' He was brought, doubting not the descent of vengeance. He said to him: 'I think we scared you. You are free for the sake of Allah, Glorious and Exalted. And So-and-so the slave girl is yours, and I have married you two.' He ordered a gift and clothing for him. We began praying for him, marveled at his action, and mentioned the action of Ishaq. He said: Ibn Abi Fanann, nicknamed Abu Abdul Rahman, was a naturally gifted poet. He had an estate in the fief of Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir. The collector used to come to him and harm him, and perhaps summon him. He wrote to Muhammad complaining of the collector and what he encountered from him of harassment: 'O son of Husayn, indeed I... became in the shelter of the Emir. We have livelihoods in his fief... upon the fresh water. I built a house in its middle... I named it the House of Joy. When I sat facing it... and drank of the milk of the juice. I said: Effacement, when I quenched... to Al-Khawarnaq and Al-Sadir. Were it not for the frequenting of a collector... like a dog on a rainy day. Coming early upon me and going... connecting evening to morning.",

    "text": "'When his face appears to me... I am driven out empty of my joy. So is the Emir, by his generosity... from the ugliness of his face, my protector?' When Muhammad read the verses, he signed under them: 'He has protected you, O Abu Abdul Rahman. We ordered the bearing of your land tax'—and its amount was eight thousand dirhams. He sent him one thousand dinars and swore on him to accept it. Ibn Abi Fanann used to not accept anything from anyone, being well-off and independent. Muhammad bin Abdullah has noble deeds whose explanation would be long to mention; in what we mentioned is sufficiency. From his beautiful poetry is his saying: 'She said with her glance: Approach. So I said to them [eyes]... with tears: At your service, O my hearing and my sight. Until when she knew that I was fond of her... she signaled to me with a tear not hidden. O concealer of his love for fear of the slanderer... Indeed I, by your life, read it from the look. Say with your glance what you desire, I will know it... and make my glance speak, it will inform you of the news.' The birth of Muhammad bin Abdullah was in the year two hundred and nine, on the night in whose morning Kaysum was conquered. In it Ubaydullah bin Yahya bin Khaqan, Ahmad bin Isra'il, and Al-Hasan bin Makhlad were born; all of them held the vizierate. Muhammad died on Saturday, thirteen nights passed of Dhu al-Qa'dah, year two hundred fifty-three. His age was forty-four years. His death was from a pimple that appeared in his throat. He died while the moon was in eclipse. He used to say: 'When the eclipse is complete and begins to clear, I will die.' It was so. He appointed his brother Ubaydullah as his successor, so Al-Mu'tazz confirmed him and sent him robes with Muflih, the deputy of Bakyak. Tahir bin Muhammad disputed the command with him, and his clients and the common people aided him until the messengers and robes came, so the command settled for Ubaydullah. Ibn al-Rumi elegized Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir: 'The Emir spent the night [dead], and the full moon of our sky spent the night [eclipsed]... this one bidding us farewell, and this one eclipsing. A moon saw a moon giving up his soul... so a brother, consoling and fair, wept for his brother. Days assassinated him, knowing... that what cannot be replaced will perish from him.' He said about him: 'And I asked about him, it was said: He died of what was in him... I said: Generosity, no doubt, died of what was in him. And as if we....... ... .......... with him. So for whom do I preserve my tears after him... and for whom do you see them pouring from their causes? For his correctness, his speech, his answer... for his youth, for the best of his manners.' Ubaydullah his brother has about him: 'The full moon and the Emir eclipsed together... so the full moon cleared while the Emir is lovesick [dead]. The full moon's light returned to its manifestation... but the Emir's light is what does not return.' He said: 'I remembered my brother without forgetting his memory... but it is a state that increases and decreases. According to the morals of time, and indeed... a life disturbed upon it will accompany me.' When Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir died, Al-Mu'tazz's grief for him intensified. He used to see that the Turks feared him because of him and for his place. He said about him: 'The joy of the Caliphate has gone from us... when Muhammad became in the graves. Shortly there will be events of time... from the light of whose fire the blaze will ignite.'",

    "text": "He said: As for Sulayman bin Abdullah bin Tahir, he was the son of his brother Muhammad bin Tahir. He sent him to Iraq in the year two hundred fifty-five as his deputy. Al-Mu'tazz ratified that and authorized him, so he established him for days. Ubaydullah went out to him, bestowed a robe on him, appointed him over the police of Baghdad, and removed Sulayman bin Abdullah. Ubaydullah entered Baghdad with a great crowd of loyalists and commanders. People received him and rejoiced at his governorship. Sulayman left before his brother's arrival to Al-Baradan, and stayed there until Musa bin Bugha arrived from the mountain (Al-Jabal). He returned the command of the police in Baghdad and Samarra and the command of Al-Sawad to him, and removed Sulayman. That was in the year two hundred fifty-seven. So Ubaydullah received the governorship in the first [instance]. Then the affair of the Tahirids in Khurasan became disordered, and Ya'qub bin al-Layth entered Nishapur. When he approached it, that being in the year eight [258], Muhammad bin Tahir sent to him asking permission to meet him, but he did not permit him. So he sent his uncles and family, and they met him. He entered Nishapur and stayed at one of its edges. Muhammad bin Tahir rode to him and met him in his tent. He began rebuking him for his negligence in his work. Then he put him and his family under guard and wrote to the Capital mentioning that he is hearing and obeying and controlling what he governs, and attacking Muhammad. Al-Muwaffaq rejected him with the ugliest rejection, and informed him that he does not approve of that. Then Ya'qub bin al-Layth advanced to Baghdad. Al-Mu'tamid marched towards him, and they met. Al-Muwaffaq was in the vanguard, Musa bin Bugha in the right wing, and Masrur al-Balkhi in the left wing. That was on Sunday, seven days passed of Rajab, and it was Palm Sunday. A great number of loyalists were killed. The war intensified, and Al-Muwaffaq uncovered his head and said: 'I am the Hashimi Boy.' Then the turn went against Ya'qub, so he was defeated in the ugliest defeat. Al-Muwaffaq and Musa bin Bugha pursued them, killing a great slaughter of them. The water was released upon them, so more drowned than were killed. Muhammad bin Tahir was with him, heavily burdened with iron. He was released from his iron, given a robe, and lodged in the house of his uncle Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir. His work in Khurasan was returned to him, and five hundred thousand dirhams were released for him. Al-Mu'tamid returned to Baghdad, and Al-Muwaffaq marched to Wasit. He contracted Ubaydullah over the two Harams. News arrived of the death of Ya'qub bin al-Layth and the rise of his brother Amr. Allegiance was taken for Amr, and he was invested with Khurasan, Fars, Kerman, Sijistan, Isfahan, and Sind. Amr wrote to Ubaydullah bin Abdullah appointing him to the police as his deputy, and sent him robes and a gold mace. Al-Muwaffaq ratified that and bestowed a robe on Ubaydullah as well. Sulayman bin Abdullah bin Tahir died in the year two hundred sixty-six in Muharram. His brother Ubaydullah stood at his grave leaning on his sword and said: 'My soul ascends in its ascents... and the tear of the eye flows in its courses. For a spot my eye has not seen the like of its scarceness [of space]... nor the like of the multitude of loved ones who settled in it.' Then Sa'id bin Makhlad appointed Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Tahir bin Abdullah bin Tahir as deputy over the City of Peace in the year two hundred seventy, so he arrested his uncle Ubaydullah and imprisoned him. Then Al-Mu'tadid appointed his slave Badr as deputy over the City of Peace, and the affair of the Tahirids ended in it and in Khurasan. Sulayman had pleasant poetry, literature, understanding, and knowledge. As for Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah bin Tahir, he was younger than his two brothers. He had literature, understanding, and pleasant poetry. From his poetry to his brother Ubaydullah—and his brothers Abdullah and Sulayman had imprisoned him: 'I used to think that I, if... one of the calamities befell me, would seek refuge in a mountain [you]. Until when the matter occurred in which... my help was obligatory without failure. You surrendered me to the lines of time playing with me... this was not my estimation nor my hope. If I were in a land of distant place, I would not have... minded the stumble of my days while the likes of you is for me. I am your brother whom you used to be familiar with... I did not change from your covenant one day nor did I cease. I am your brother, and Allah is looking... at the secrets, so cut after or separate.' From his poetry also to his brother when he was imprisoned—he was accused of writing to the Sijistani—so he wrote from prison swearing on the falsehood of that, and wrote at the end of the note these verses: 'Sulayma says, terrified by my imprisonment... as a painful bereavement terrifies a mother of one. Time refused except that its vicissitude befalls you... like its denied habit with every noble. I said to her: Lower your [eyes], for indeed... the striking calamities strike men. And do not wonder at the imprisonment, woe to you, but wonder... at the denial of what I narrated in the scenes.",

    "text": "'I was imprisoned for a war whose struggle I did not witness... and my jailer became my brother and son of my father.' From his beautiful poetry: 'O shining, blooming moon... bright of beauty, splendid, dazzling. Convey peace to your likeness and congratulate her... on sleep, and inform her that I am awake.' Al-Mu'tadid admired this poetry, so he sang it in the light Ramal mode, and it was one of his songs. Abu Abdullah bin Hamdun mentioned that Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir used to serve as chamberlain to Al-Mutawakkil in Surra Man Ra'a for two months, then descend to Baghdad to stay there for two months, and his deputies would succeed him in Surra Man Ra'a. He came once taking his brother Abdul Aziz with him. He had bought a slave girl who had a place in his heart. Separation from her was hard on him. He said: So he asked me to seek permission from his brother for him to return to Baghdad, on condition that he give me a monthly [horse] I had seen under him. I did so, and he permitted him, so he gave me the monthly. Then he recited this poetry to me: 'I say when memory stirred my heart... and Sirius intercepted in the middle of the sky. As if it is a ruby on a horn... How long is the night in Surra Man Ra'a. O Lord, a release like the release of captives... For if You find for me another escape. Make my nearest steps Basra... until I return with mounts weary. As if they are drunk from fatigue... then I live like the life of Khosrow.' None of the children of Abdullah bin Tahir entered Baghdad except these four: Muhammad, Ubaydullah, Sulayman, and Abdul Aziz. As for Abdullah bin Tahir, he was among the masters of people in literature, virtue, politics, management, generosity, and nobility. Al-Ma'mun adopted him and raised him. His birth was in the year one hundred eighty-two. Abu Ahmad Ubaydullah bin Abdullah mentioned that Abu al-Abbas Abdullah bin Tahir left Al-Ma'mun's house one night, after Tahir's departure to Khurasan. Wine had overcome him, so he slept in the Tahirid Dome in Tahir's house in the City of Peace. A corner of the burlap, having dried, caught fire from the candle, so the Dome burned. Abdullah was carried and taken out of it. The news reached Tahir, so he wrote to Abdullah blaming and rebuking him, saying: 'If the news of your death had arrived, it would have been easier on me than its arrival with your scandal, and that wine reaches with you a level where you do not sense the burning of a place you are in.' He ordered him to prepare and come out to him. That worried Abdullah, and he hid it from all people, sealed the letter, and put it under his prayer rug. Worry appeared on him. Al-Ma'mun asked him about his news, but he hid it. Then he asked his intimates, who informed him that a letter had arrived to him whose contents were unknown. Al-Ma'mun swore on him to bring the letter, so he brought it. Al-Ma'mun wrote to Tahir reproaching him for what he did, informing him of his [Abdullah's] status with him and his placing him in the place of a son, and that Tahir has no authority over him except by right of his deputyship; if he removed him from it, he has no right to disturb him from the Presence. Tahir answered with thanks for his favor since this was his place with him. The Dome was rebuilt, and it remained until it was demolished in the year two hundred ninety-three. Abdullah went out to Sham in the year two hundred nine, fought Nasr bin Shabath until he overcame him.",

    "text": "Ubaydullah bin Abdullah said: Nusayr, Yasir, and a group of the sheikhs of our clients told me that Abu al-Abbas Abdullah bin Tahir, when he overlooked Kaysum, Nasr bin Shabath fortified himself in it. He rode the next day, having mobilized his army for the encounter. He met Nasr who had come out of the fortress. He lined up opposite him and stood facing him until night without war. Then Nasr lit fires. Abdullah consulted his commanders. They said: 'This is night, let us return and spend the night in our camp, then go early to him for war.' He said: 'The return of the warrior is retreat, and I will not leave my position.' He dismounted. He had a quartan fever, and it was its turn that night. He suffered a severe fever attack. He sought something to warm him but there was nothing with them. They said: 'Dig a hole with your swords.' He ordered straw to be gathered from the nosebags of the beasts and thrown into the hole. That was done, then he sat in it. The sky brought down rain and severe hail. He said: 'Cover me with your shields.' We remained like that all our night covering him until morning. We prayed and he prayed, put on his weapons again, rode his horse, and went to the edge, and we were with him. He looked, and behold, there was no one outside the fortress. He said: 'The wretch deceived us and made us imagine he was opposite us, entered his fortress, and appointed someone to light fires. Now he will come out against you with his intensity. So take your caution.' He called Al-Aziz and said: 'Go with two thousand knights, rest and relax'—and he named a place for them to be—'and let none of you leave until Tahir bin Ibrahim bin Mudrik comes to him with my message. If he comes to you, if you and your companions can be on the wings of birds until you join me, do so.' He left. He did not finish speaking before Nasr came out and charged at them. Abdullah emerged to him leading his companions. Attacks and fighting continued between them, Abdullah ransoming his companions, promising them, and throwing himself into every target, until the sun was in the middle of the sky. Everyone with him showed weakness and inability. Tahir sent to Al-Aziz ordering him to hasten, so he arrived. When Nasr and those with him saw the black banners and the black lions—and Abdullah was the one who adopted them—they panicked and failure appeared in them. Abdullah said to Al-Aziz: 'You and your companions towards the people!' It was but an hour until Nasr was defeated and took refuge in his fortress. Abu al-Abbas called for the sappers and ordered the setting up of ballistas, mangonels, and ladders. They looked and saw no one in the fortress. Behold, Nasr had dug a tunnel from behind the fortress and exited from it. He ordered the men, so they opened the door. He entered and he and his companions looted everything in the fortress. He was given glad tidings at that time and congratulated on the victory. 'Awf bin Muhallim al-Khuza'i recited to him: 'Thank your Lord for the Day of the Fortress for His blessing... He has granted you the glory of victory and triumph.' It is a long poem. Nasr went and took refuge in mountains that did not protect him, so he sought refuge in safety (Aman). Abdullah wrote to Al-Ma'mun informing him. He wrote back: 'Give him safety on condition that he treads the carpet of the Commander of the Faithful and his judgment be executed on him.' He agreed to that. Abdullah sent him with Muhammad bin al-Husayn bin Mus'ab to Al-Ma'mun's presence. He said: Nasr had grown old. Al-Ma'mun saw him being carried by two of his boys on the saddle. He said: 'Nasr is carried by two!' He said: 'Yes, O Commander of the Faithful, and two hundred cannot bring him down!' Then Abdullah bin Tahir marched to Egypt in the year ten and conquered it. Ibn al-Sari sought safety from him. He stayed there until the year eleven. He came to Al-Ma'mun having reformed the country, collected its wealth, and stabilized its conditions. Abu Ishaq and Al-Abbas bin al-Ma'mun received him. He arrived with those who had overcome Egypt. He said: Al-Ma'mun said one day: 'Do you know a man who exceeds all people of his time in integrity and good conduct?' A group mentioned people and praised them. He said: 'I did not mean these.' Ali bin Salih, master of the prayer place, said: 'I do not know, O Commander of the Faithful, anyone with such a description except Umar bin al-Khattab.' Al-Ma'mun said: 'O Allah, forgiveness; I did not mean Quraysh.' The group remained silent. Al-Ma'mun said: 'That is Abdullah bin Tahir. I governed him over Egypt while its wealth was abundant. He found for Ubaydullah bin al-Sari wealth that description falls short of. He did not touch a dinar or a dirham of it. He did not leave Egypt except with ten thousand dinars, three horses, and two donkeys. But he is the planting of my hand and the graduate of my discipline. I will recite to you verses in his description.' Then he recited: 'Forbearing with piety, brave with death... generous when the pouring cloud is not moist. Strong in the anchor of the heart in the position where... the hearts of the worlds have palpitations. A youth who is noble without affectation... and polite without the discipline of men.'",

    "text": "He stayed before Al-Ma'mun for a year, then he sent him to Babak, who had appeared and whose power had grown great. He stayed facing him for a year. He had stipulated to Al-Ma'mun that if he overcame Babak, he would return to the Gate (Court), so his residence would be in the presence of Al-Ma'mun, and he would choose for his deputyship over Khurasan whomever he liked of his brothers. He stayed at Dinawar for nine months preparing to fight Babak. While he was so, a letter from the governor of Nishapur arrived to Al-Ma'mun mentioning that the renegades (Kharijites) raided a village of it called Al-Hamra on the main road, and that they burned, captured, and killed women and children. This was grave to Al-Ma'mun. He called Ishaq bin Ibrahim—who was Abdullah bin Tahir's deputy over the police—and Yahya bin Aktham, and sent them to Abdullah. He wrote with them a letter in his handwriting to Abdullah swearing on him to move his camp from the face of Babak to the face of Khurasan, for Khurasan is more important than the entire kingdom after the Capital, and to advise him on whom to send to Babak. He complied with what he ordered him, advised Ali bin Hisham, wrote to those in Khurasan what he liked, and sent his brother Muhammad bin Tahir in his vanguard. Ali bin Hisham arrived and agreed with him on the road regarding fighting Babak. He went on his way to Khurasan, until he reached Nishapur. He wrote to Al-Ma'mun that the Commander of the Faithful urged me to this frontier because of what had overcome it of the matter of Al-Hamra, and what the renegades caused in it. I arrived in Nishapur and found what is around it to be the nest of the renegades, and found it the most important of districts, and the important is more apparent and more severe (Abda wa Ada). He said: Al-Ma'mun admired the letter because of this phrase, and the scribes kept mentioning it among themselves. His stay in Khurasan, until he died there, was fifteen years. Ibn Jadan mentioned from Al-Juludi, saying: Abdullah sat one day in Khurasan and gave justice to the notables of commanders and emirs of soldiers; he struck necks, cut hands and feet, and contracted contracts. When the sun declined, he entered his house. Al-Juludi said: I was closest to his heart and boldest with him. The servants received him; this one took his tunic, another his boot, and another his legging. He remained in a tunic and trousers. He lifted the tunic onto his shoulder and began saying: 'The scent is musk and the faces are dinars... and the tips of the fingers are anemone.' He said: I spoke harshly to him, pulled his garment off his shoulder, returned him to his state, and said to him: 'You sit today the sitting of Alexander and Dara bin Dara, and do now the deed of 'Allawayh and Mukhariq?' He said: He looked at me the look of the assailant, returned his garment to his shoulder, and said: 'The soul must, since it is directed... move from state to state.' When Al-Ma'mun died, Al-Mu'tasim confirmed Abdullah bin Tahir over Khurasan and Ishaq bin Ibrahim over his deputyship in Baghdad, but he had a bad opinion of him. He wrote to him: 'As for what follows: May Allah heal us both. There were in my soul resentments against you, the change of which is the remaining of revenge against you for you. There remain of them small things I fear for you from them. So do not come forward. Suffice you of what I harbor for you my revealing to you what is in my conscience. Peace.' Al-Fadl bin Marwan said: Al-Mu'tasim mentioned Abdullah bin Tahir one day and criticized him. The group followed him and described him with bad obedience while I was present. I stood up and said: 'Write to him to come; he will not reach evening before he sets out.' He said: 'Sit and write to him with the news.' He wrote a letter to Al-Mu'tasim, which he sent folded in my letter to him. He asked me to deliver it from my hand to his hand, so I did. Al-Mu'tasim read it and began asking me about letter after letter. I opened it for him: behold, he had written swearing that if the letter arrived to him to set out, he would not reach evening before setting out. Abu al-'Umaythal said: I entered upon Abdullah bin Tahir. He said: 'You are indeed looking at the roles (Ad'ur? Unclear) little what you see.' He extended his hand to me, and I kissed it. He said: 'You were more undutiful to me with it than you were dutiful.' I said: 'With what?' He said: 'With the roughness of your mustache.' I said: 'Indeed, the spines of the hedgehog do not harm the lion's paw.' He said: 'This, by Allah, is more beloved to me than the praise of a hundred rhymes.' He ordered ten thousand dirhams for me. The death of Abdullah bin Tahir was in the year two hundred thirty, in the days of Al-Wathiq.",

    "text": "Ahmad bin Abi Dawud mentioned that Muhammad bin Abdul Malik advised Al-Wathiq, when the news of Abdullah bin Tahir's death arrived, to send Ishaq bin Ibrahim bin Mus'ab to Khurasan in Abdullah's place. He agreed to that and ordered him to write his letters and oversee his preparation. He said: Al-Wathiq sent for me, so I attended the house. I saw Muhammad bin Abdul Malik and Ishaq bin Ibrahim sitting, and Muhammad writing the letter. When he saw me, he turned it over. I took it as an omen that what they were in would be overturned. I entered upon Al-Wathiq. He mentioned to me the news of Abdullah bin Tahir's death, and that he had decided to send Ishaq to Khurasan, add five thousand men of the army to him, release their stipends, and release five million dirhams to Ishaq as aid. I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, Ishaq is the hostage of the people [Tahirids] with you. If you send him out, you will have nothing of the people in your hand. As for the army, you need to increase them, so how can you disperse them, especially with what is spent on them? Sending out these monies has no justification. Here is what is better than that.' He said: 'What is it?' I said: 'A scroll for two dirhams in which you write to Tahir bin Abdullah offering condolences for his father and renewing the governorship for him. You gain what you would spend, and you would have completed the favor for Abdullah and his child and improved the successorship in him.' He said: 'The right is what you said!' He ordered Muhammad bin Abdul Malik to do that and to abandon what he had decided on. The duration of Abdullah bin Tahir's life was forty-eight years. As for Tahir bin al-Husayn, he was among the masters of people, men of opinion and might. Al-Ma'mun named him Dhu al-Yamanayn (Possessor of Two Right Hands), so he used to write and be written to with it. Al-Mu'tasim asked a group of his intimates about the meaning of naming Tahir Dhu al-Yamanayn, but they did not know. Muhammad bin Abdul Malik said: 'Its meaning is: Possessor of Two Entitlements (Istihqaqayn): entitlement by his grandfather and closeness in the state, for he was one of the Nuqaba'; and entitlement by what he has in Al-Ma'mun's state. Allah Almighty said: \"We would have seized him by the right hand (Al-Yamin),\" meaning by entitlement. And the poet said: \"If a banner is raised for glory... 'Arraba receives it with the right hand (Yamin).\"' Jabhan al-Shi'i mentioned, saying: Al-Husayn bin Mus'ab was of good opinion, excellent in hitting the mark with conjecture. He said: I was one day in the house of Ali bin Isa bin Mahan, and he had ordered Tahir bin al-Husayn, so he was tied with a rope to a pillar. Al-Husayn said to me: 'Do you not see this tied one'—meaning his son—'he will surely kill the owner of this palace.' This saying passed with me as a joke. Then what happened between them happened, so I marveled at Al-Husayn's saying. He said: When Al-Amin sent Ali bin Isa bin Mahan with armies to Khurasan to take Al-Ma'mun and send him to him, Al-Ma'mun contracted Tahir bin al-Husayn over four thousand and sent him to Rayy to fight Ali bin Isa. Ali bin Isa wrote to him to establish provisions for him, not thinking he would fight him. Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Tahir said: Abdul Rahman bin Fahm told me, from his uncle, saying: I set out seeking Al-Ma'mun. I pushed to Tahir's camp on the day of the battle. I saw him arranging the rows, going and coming, with a piece of bread in his hand. With a boy of his was a lead pitcher containing water. I said: 'O Emir, this is not a time for eating!' He said: 'An apology to you and to those who do not know my news. No food has entered my stomach for three [days] due to my preoccupation with this matter, and I feared I might need my self [strength] and it would betray me at this time. So I did what you saw.' I said: 'The Emir knows better what he suffers.' Ubaydullah said: A group of our sheikhs told me, saying: When Ali's army approached, their standard bearer was Hatim al-Ta'i. He had been flogged eight hundred lashes until the flesh of his buttocks was gone. He was huge in build, fierce in might. He had four boys lifting him until he sat in his saddle. Once settled in his saddle, he was counted as a thousand knights. Tahir said: I made him my target and charged at him. When I got close to him, behold he was covered in iron, the blow not reaching him. I saw something that appalled me. I said: 'There is nothing but to strike him on the helmet; if the sword works in it, [good], otherwise it is destruction.' I gathered my hands then struck him on his head. I cut the helmet and the head, until the sword got stuck between his teeth. He said: When Hatim was killed, the people were disturbed. Ali bin Isa was riding in a dome (howdah). He came down from it, and a rusty-legged chestnut horse was brought to him to ride. Dawud Siyah stabbed him before he could settle in his saddle, killing him without knowing him. He went to Tahir and said: 'I have killed the Judge of the Army,' then brought his head. Tahir's caller called out: 'Whoever takes something, it is his, and the obligation is clear of whoever sheds blood.' He wrote to Al-Ma'mun and Dhu al-Ri'asatayn: 'My letter [is written] while Ali bin Isa's head is before me and his ring is on my finger. Peace.' Then Tahir marched to Baghdad, and his affair was what it was.",

    "text": "He said: Al-Ma'mun, upon his entry into Baghdad, was angry with Muhammad bin Abi al-Abbas al-Tusi. He sought refuge with Tahir bin al-Husayn, who was his friend, and asked him to ask Al-Ma'mun to forgive him. Fath the servant was the doorkeeper for wine, Yasir handled the robes, Husayn poured, and Abu Maryam, the boy of Sa'id al-Jawhari, went back and forth for needs. Tahir rode to the house. Fath entered and said: 'Tahir is at the door!' He said: 'It is not one of his times; let him in.' Tahir entered upon Al-Ma'mun while he was drinking. He gave him a rotl to drink and ordered him to sit. He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is not for the Chief of Police to sit before his master.' Al-Ma'mun said: 'That is in the general assembly; as for the private assembly, sitting is permitted for him.' Then he gave him two more rotls. Al-Ma'mun wept, and his eyes welled up. Tahir said to him: 'Why do you weep, O Commander of the Faithful? May Allah not make your eye weep, when the lands have submitted to you, the servants have yielded to you, and you have come to love in all your affairs?' He said: 'I weep for a matter in whose mention is humiliation and in whose concealment is sadness. No one is free of grief. Speak your need if you have one!' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, Muhammad bin Abi al-Abbas erred; forgive his slip and be pleased with him.' He said: 'I have become pleased with him and ordered his gift and the return of his rank. Were it not that he is not of the people of intimacy, I would have brought him!' He thanked that, prayed for Al-Ma'mun, and left, his heart occupied by his weeping. He said to Marwan bin Jabghawayh his scribe: 'Scribes have subtlety, and the people of Khurasan support each other. Take with you three hundred thousand dirhams. Give Al-Husayn the servant two hundred thousand, give his scribe Muhammad bin Harun one hundred thousand, and ask him to ask the Commander of the Faithful why he wept?' He said: He did that. When Al-Husayn was alone with Al-Ma'mun the next day, and his soul was pleasant, he asked him about the reason for his weeping. He said to him: 'Why did you ask about that?' He said: 'Because of my distress for it and my disturbance for its sake.' He said: 'O Husayn, it is a thing that if it leaves your head, I will kill you!' He said: 'O my master, when have I revealed a secret for you?' He said: 'When I saw Tahir, I remembered Muhammad my brother and what humiliation befell him. Tears choked me, so I found relief in pouring them out. Tahir will not escape from me what he hates.' He said: Muhammad bin Harun informed Tahir of that. Tahir rode to Ahmad bin Abi Khalid, who was the Vizier, and said to him: 'A favor with me is not lost, and praise from me is not cheap. Absent me from the Commander of the Faithful.' He said to him: 'Come to me early tomorrow, for I will do it.' He went to him early, and Ibn Abi Khalid went early to Al-Ma'mun. When he reached him, he said: 'I did not sleep last night!' He said: 'Why, woe to you?' He said: 'Because you appointed Ghassan bin Abbad over Khurasan, and he and those with him are a mere mouthful (eaters of a head). I fear a rebel might come out against him and uproot him.' He said: 'I have thought about what you thought about. Whom do you see?' He said: 'Tahir bin al-Husayn.' He said: 'Woe to you, O Ahmad, he is, by Allah, a deposer.' He said: 'I am the guarantor for him.' He kept at him until he answered him. He called for Tahir immediately, contracted him, and he set out the same day. He camped at the garden of Khalil bin Hisham; that was Friday, one night remaining of Dhu al-Qa'dah, year two hundred and five. When Tahir bin al-Husayn arrived in Khurasan, the Shurat (Kharijites) had increased there and their matter intensified. Al-Ma'mun wrote him many letters urging him to combat them and criticizing his sluggishness in their affair. Tahir wrote mentioning the coarseness of their affair and the strength of their power, and that he needed an increase in equipment and men to meet them. That angered Al-Ma'mun, so he wrote to him harshly, saying: 'I have resolved to return you to where your father is.' Kulthum bin Thabit bin Abi Sa'd, nicknamed Abu Sa'da, who was in charge of the post over Tahir bin al-Husayn in Khurasan, mentioned that he sat on Friday near the pulpit when what happened from Tahir became clear upon the arrival of what arrived to him. Tahir ascended the pulpit and preached. When he reached the mention of the Caliph, he refrained from praying for him and said: 'O Allah, rectify the nation of Muhammad with what You rectified Your allies, and spare it the burden of those who transgressed in it and gathered against it, by mending the rift, sparing blood, and reconciling relationships.' He said: 'I knew I would be the first killed, because I could not hide the news, and my letter would not be hidden from Tahir. I left, washed the washing of the dead, wrapped myself in a waistcloth, put on a shirt, donned a cloak, and threw on black [Abbasid color]. I forced myself to write to Al-Ma'mun. But Allah brought from His work, by the proximity of Tahir's death, what I did not reckon.' When the news of that reached Al-Ma'mun, it was hard on him. He called Ahmad bin Abi Khalid and said to him: 'I had told you about Tahir when you advised appointing him to Khurasan what I knew of him, and you guaranteed what would happen. By Allah, if you do not devise a way to fix his affair as you guaranteed his corruption, I will strike your neck.' Ibn Abi Khalid sent gifts and novelties to Tahir, including poisoned white Kamikh (condiment), knowing his fondness for it. When the gifts reached Tahir, he ate from the Kamikh with roast francolin, and died after two days.",

    "text": "The birth of Tahir bin al-Husayn was in Muharram, year one hundred fifty-nine. His death was in the year two hundred seven. When he died, the soldiers in Khurasan rioted and looted Tahir's treasuries. Al-Ma'mun appointed his son Talha in his place, and sent Ahmad bin Abi Khalid to Khurasan to assist him in restoring order. He went there, fixed matters, and calmed their disturbance. Talha sent him three thousand dirhams and goods worth two million dirhams, and gifted Ibrahim bin al-Abbas his scribe five thousand dirhams. \n\n**Dayr al-Susi (Monastery of al-Susi)**\nThis is a small monastery on the bank of the Tigris, at the Qadisiyah of Surra Man Ra'a (Samarra). Between Qadisiyah and Surra Man Ra'a are four farsakhs, and Al-Matira is between them. All these areas are parks, gardens, and vineyards. People visit this monastery and drink in its gardens. It is one of the places of joy and spots of revelry and play. Ibn al-Mu'tazz has [poetry] in it: 'O my nights at Al-Matira and Al-Karkh... and the neighborhood of Al-Susi, by Allah, return. You were to me samples of Paradise... but without eternity.' Qadisiyah is one of the best and most pleasant places; it is a mine of drink and a resting place for pleasure-seekers, gathering what the people of idleness and loss seek. In Qadisiyah, Al-Mutawakkil built his palace known as Barkuwara. When he finished building it, he gifted it to his son Al-Mu'tazz and performed his circumcision there. It was one of Al-Mutawakkil's best and most magnificent buildings. The expenditure on it reached twenty million dirhams. He said: When his resolve was firm on circumcising Abu Abdullah Al-Mu'tazz, he ordered Al-Fath bin Khaqan to prepare for it, and to seek in the treasuries of furnishings a carpet for the Iwan in its width and length. Its length was one hundred cubits and its width fifty cubits. It was only found in what was confiscated from the Banu Umayya; it was found in the belongings of Hisham bin Abdul Malik, matching the length and width of the Iwan. It was a silk carpet with gold stitching, sorted and lined. When Al-Mutawakkil saw it, he admired it and wanted to know its value. Merchants were gathered for it, and it was mentioned that it was valued at the average price of ten thousand dinars. It was spread in the Iwan. A throne was spread for the Caliph at the head of the Iwan. Four thousand gold trays encrusted with jewels were extended before him, containing figures of amber, kneaded musk, and camphor made like images; some encrusted with jewels only, and some with gold and jewels. They were made a spread-out carpet. Al-Mutawakkil and the people had lunch. He sat on the throne. The Emirs, commanders, boon companions, and rank holders were brought and seated in their ranks. A gap was made between their trays and the tablecloth. The carpet spreaders came with baskets covered with leather filled with dinars and dirhams, half and half. They were poured into those gaps until they rose high. The boys stood on top of them and ordered the people on behalf of the Caliph to drink, and that everyone who drinks should transfer with three handfuls what his hands could carry of that money. When what gathered in his sleeve weighed one down, he would go out to his servants, give it to them, and return to his seat. Whenever a place became empty, the spreaders brought what filled it until it returned to its state. Three robes were bestowed on everyone present. They stayed until the Asr and Maghrib prayers were prayed. Upon their departure, they were mounted on horses and noble steeds. Al-Mutawakkil freed one thousand slaves on behalf of Al-Mu'tazz, and ordered for each one of them one hundred dirhams and three garments. In the courtyard of the house, before the Iwan, were four hundred beautiful women wearing types of clothes. Before them were a thousand rattan baskets containing types of fruits: citron, bitter orange—despite its scarcity at that time—Syrian apples, limes, five thousand bunches of narcissus, and ten thousand bunches of violet. He advanced to Al-Fath to scatter upon the beautiful women, the house servants, and the entourage what he had prepared for them, which was twenty million dirhams. No one dared to pick up anything. So Al-Fath took a dirham, and the group bent over the money and looted it. Qabiha had ordered dirhams to be struck, on which was: 'Blessing from Allah, for the circumcision of Abu Abdullah Al-Mu'tazz Billah.' One million dirhams were struck for her, which were scattered on the barber and those in his sphere, the boys, the Shakiriya, the house stewards, and the special servants, white and black. Among those who attended the assembly that day were Muhammad bin Al-Muntasir, Abu Ahmad and Abu Sulayman the sons of Al-Rashid, Ahmad and Al-Abbas the sons of Al-Mu'tasim, Musa bin Al-Ma'mun, the two sons of Hamdun the Boon Companion, Ahmad bin Abi Ruaym, Al-Husayn bin al-Dahhak, Ali bin al-Jahm, Ali bin Yahya al-Munajjim and his brother Ahmad. Of the singers: Amr bin Bana, Ahmad bin Abi al-Ala, Ibn al-Hafsi, Ibn al-Makki, Salmak al-Razi, Ath'ath, Sulayman the Drummer, Al-Masdud, Abu Hashisha, Ibn al-Qassar, Salih the Tambourine Player, Zanam the Piper, Tuffah the Piper.",

    "text": "Of the female singers: Arib, her slave girl Bid'a, Sarab, Shariya and her slave girls, Nadman, Mun'im, Najla, Turkiyah, Farida, Irfan. Ibrahim bin al-Mudabbir said: When Al-Mu'tazz was circumcised, the sheikhs of the scribes gathered before Al-Mutawakkil. Among them was Yahya bin Khaqan and his son Ubaydullah, who was then the Vizier, standing in the position of servants with a tunic and belt. Yahya did not drink wine. Al-Mutawakkil said to Ubaydullah: 'Take a cup from those cups, pour wine into it, put a napkin on your shoulder, go to your father Yahya, and place it in his palm.' He said: He did so. Yahya raised his head to his son. Al-Mutawakkil said: 'O Yahya, do not refuse him.' He said: 'No, O Commander of the Faithful.' Then he drank it and said: 'Your favor has become great with us, O Commander of the Faithful. May Allah congratulate you on the blessing and not strip us of what He bestowed upon us through you.' He said: 'O Yahya, I only wanted a Vizier to serve you before a Caliph in the circumcision of a Crown Prince!' Ibrahim bin al-Abbas said: I asked Abu Harmala the Barber on this day, saying: 'How much did you get until the food was placed?' He said: 'Eighty-odd thousand dinars, besides jewelry, rings, and prepared gems.' He said: Al-Mutawakkil stayed at Barkuwara for three days, then ascended to his Ja'fari palace. He ordered the presence of Ibrahim bin al-Abbas and commanded him to make a report for him of what was spent in this circumcision and present it to him. He did so. The report comprised eighty-six million dirhams. People used to consider excessive what Al-Hasan bin Sahl spent on the wedding of his daughter Buran, such that it was chronicled in books and called the Invitation of Islam. Then came Al-Mutawakkil's invitation, which made that forgotten. The famous invitations in Islam were three which had no equal. Among them: This mentioned invitation of Al-Mu'tazz. And among them the wedding of Zubaydah bint Ja'far bin Abi Ja'far. Al-Mahdi married his son Al-Rashid to Umm Ja'far (Zubaydah), his brother's daughter. He prepared for her what had not been prepared for a woman before her of instruments, boxes of jewels, ornaments, tiaras, wreaths, domes of silver and gold, perfume, and clothing. He gave her the tunic of Abda daughter of Abdullah bin Yazid bin Muawiyah, wife of Hisham; the like of it and the like of the grains (pearls/gems) in it had not been seen in Islam. On its back and front were two lines of red ruby, and the rest of it was of large pearls which had no equal. Al-Rashid consummated the marriage with her in Muharram, year one hundred sixty-five, in his palace known as Al-Khuld. People were gathered from the horizons, and a great amount of money was distributed among them. Dinars were placed in silver bowls, dirhams in gold bowls, musk sacs and amber skulls and ghaliya in glass vessels. This was distributed to the people, and woven embroidered robes were bestowed upon them. Amber candles were lit before him that night in gold torcheres. He brought the women of Banu Hashim and gave each of them a bag containing dinars, a bag containing dirhams, and a large silver tray containing perfume, and bestowed on her a heavy embroidered robe. The like of it was not seen in Islam. The expenditure in this wedding from the privy purse, besides what Al-Rashid spent from his own money, reached fifty million dirhams. Zubaydah's name was Amat al-Aziz. Zubaydah was a nickname. Abu Ja'far used to bounce her when she was small—and she was chubby—and say: 'You are nothing but a Zubaydah (little butter ball/cream), you are nothing but a Zubaydah.' So this name stuck to her. And among them the wedding of Al-Ma'mun to Buran daughter of Al-Hasan bin Sahl, at Fam al-Sulh. The expenditure on it was a great matter. Al-Ma'mun asked Zubaydah about the estimate of expenditure in the wedding. She said: 'Between thirty-five million to thirty-seven million.' This reached Al-Hasan bin Sahl, so he said: 'It seems the expenditure was by Zubaydah's hand! We spent thirty-five million.' Among the total allowances every day was provision for thirty-odd thousand sailors. His consummation with her was in the city he built at Fam al-Sulh on the bank of the Tigris, on the eighth passed of the month of Ramadan, year two hundred ten. He said: Al-Ma'mun gave Buran a dower of one hundred thousand dinars and five million dirhams. Three amber candles were lit before him that night, and their smoke was abundant. Zubaydah said: 'In the chivalry that has appeared is sufficiency; remove these amber candles and bring the [wax] candles.' He said: When Buran was unveiled to Al-Ma'mun, he scattered large pearls upon her which were in his sleeve. They fell on a gold mat that was beneath him. He said: 'How excellent is Al-Hasan bin Hani (Abu Nuwas), what a great eloquent poet he is where he says: \"As if the small and large of its bubbles... were pearl pebbles on a ground of gold.\"' He said: Those present refrained from picking up anything. Al-Ma'mun said: 'Honor her!' So Zubaydah extended her hand and took a pearl, then those present picked up the rest.",

    "text": "Buran's name was Khadija. Her death was in the year two hundred seventy-one, in the days of Al-Mu'tamid, and she was eighty years old. Buran has [poetry] elegizing Al-Ma'mun: 'Aid me in weeping, O my two eyes... You have become, after the Imam, for worry in me. I used to attack Time, but when... he died, Time began to attack me.' Ibn Khurdadhbih mentioned: That Al-Mutawakkil spent on the buildings he constructed—which are: Barkuwara, Al-Shah, Al-Arus, Al-Birka, Al-Jawsaq, Al-Mukhtar, Al-Ja'fari, Al-Gharib, Al-Badi', Al-Sabih, Al-Malih, Al-Sindan, Al-Qasr, Al-Jami', Al-Qallaya, Al-Burj, Qasr al-Mutawakkiliya, Al-Bahw, and Al-Lu'lu'ah: two hundred seventy-four million dirhams. And of gold one hundred million dinars. The value of the silver as gold at the exchange rate of the time, with what was in it of gold, is thirteen million five hundred twenty-five thousand dinars. He said: Al-Mutawakkil drank one day in Barkuwara. He said to his boon companions: 'Do you see that if it is not the days of roses, we do not make a Shadhkulah (Flower Festival)?' They said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, the Shadhkulah is only with roses.' He said: 'Nay. Call Ubaydullah bin Yahya for me.' He attended. He said: 'Order dirhams to be struck for me, in each dirham two grains.' He said: 'What amount, O Commander of the Faithful?' He said: 'Five million dirhams.' Ubaydullah ordered their striking, so they were struck, and he informed him of the news. He said: 'Dye some of them red, yellow, and black, and leave some as they are.' He did so. Then he ordered the servants and entourage, who were seven hundred, that each one of them prepare a new tunic and cap of a different color than the other's tunic and cap. They did so. Then he chose a day when the wind was moving. A dome with forty doors was set up for him. He drank the morning draught in it, and the boon companions were around him. The servants wore the clothing he had prepared. He ordered the scattering of the dirhams as roses are scattered. They were scattered bit by bit. The wind carried the dirhams so they paused between the sky and earth as roses pause. It was one of Al-Mutawakkil's best and wittiest days. Al-Burj (The Tower) was one of his best buildings. He made in it huge images of gold and silver, and a large pool whose lining, exterior and interior, he made of silver plates. He placed on it a gold tree, containing every bird that calls and whistles, crowned with jewels, and named it Tuba. A large gold throne was made for him, upon which were images of two great lions, and on its steps were images of beasts and eagles and the like, according to what the throne of Solomon son of David, peace be upon them, is described with. He made the walls of the palace from inside and outside covered with mosaic and gilded marble. The expenditure on this palace reached one million seven hundred thousand dinars. He sat in it on the gold throne, wearing heavy embroidered clothes. He ordered that no one enter upon him except in woven embroidered clothes or brocade on the outside. His sitting in it was in the year two hundred thirty-nine. Then he called for food. The boon companions and all singers and entertainers attended, and people ate. He tried to sleep but could not. Al-Fath said to him: 'O my master, this is not a day of sleep.' So he sat for drinking. When night came, he tried to sleep, but it was not possible. He called for violet oil, put some on his head and inhaled it, but it did not benefit him. He remained for three days and nights not sleeping. Then he developed a sharp fever. He moved to Al-Haruni, the palace of his brother Al-Wathiq, and stayed there for six months sick. He ordered the demolition of Al-Burj and the minting of those ornaments into coin. \n\n**Dayr Marmar (Monastery of Marmar)**\nThis monastery is in Surra Man Ra'a, at the Bridge of Wasif. It is a populated monastery with many monks. Around it are vineyards and trees. It is one of the pleasant spots and good beautiful places. Al-Fadl bin al-Abbas bin al-Ma'mun has [poetry] in it: 'I exhausted the horses of my pleasures in Surra Man Ra'a... and attained in it the wishes of my soul and my desires. I populated in it the spots of amusement immersed... in revelry between rivers and gardens. In Dayr Marmar when we revive the morning drink in it... and work the cup in it in the evenings. Between bells and holiness at times... and at times between ouds and flutes. And how many a gazelle in it, slender-necked, flirtatious... hunting us with Babylonian glances.'",

    "text": "Al-Fadl mentioned this: He went out one day with Al-Mu'tazz for hunting. He said: I, he, and Yunus bin Bugha became separated from the procession. Al-Mu'tazz complained of thirst. I said to him: 'O Commander of the Faithful, there is a monk in this monastery whom I know; he has good affection and a light spirit, and there are beautiful instruments inside. Would the Commander of the Faithful like to divert to him?' He said: 'Do so.' So we went to the monk (Dayrani). He welcomed us and met us with the most beautiful reception, and brought us cold water which we drank. He offered for us to dismount at his place and said: 'Cool yourselves with us, and we will bring you what is available in our monastery for you to partake of?' Al-Mu'tazz found him charming and said: 'Let us dismount to him.' So we dismounted. The monk asked me about Al-Mu'tazz and Yunus bin Bugha. I said: 'They are two youths from the sons of the soldiers.' He said: 'Rather, they are two escaped ones from the spouses of the Houris!' I said: 'This is not of your religion nor your belief!' He said: 'It is now my religion and belief!' Al-Mu'tazz laughed. Then he brought us bread, condiments, and what is typical in monasteries; it was of the cleanest food, the best taste, and the finest vessels. We ate and washed our hands. Al-Mu'tazz said to me: 'Ask him, between you and him: Who would you love to be with you from these two and not part from you?' He said: I asked him, and he said: 'Both of them, and a date.' Al-Mu'tazz laughed until he leaned against the wall of the monastery from laughter. I said to the monk: 'You must choose.' He said: 'Choice in this is destruction! Allah has not created a mind that can distinguish between these.' Then the procession caught up with us, and the monk was terrified. Al-Mu'tazz said to him: 'By my life, do not cut off what we were in, for I am a master to those there and a friend to those here.' We sat for an hour, and Al-Mu'tazz ordered fifty thousand dirhams for him. He said: 'By Allah, I will not accept it except on a condition.' He asked: 'What is it?' He said: 'That the Commander of the Faithful attends my invitation with whomever he likes.' He said: 'That is up to you.' So we agreed on a day, and we came to him as he wished. nothing was left to be desired; he stood with those who were with him, and brought the children of the Christians who served us with the best service. Al-Mu'tazz was pleased with a pleasure the likes of which I had never seen. He gave him a large sum of money on that day, and he never ceased visiting him when he passed by, eating and drinking at his place for the rest of his life. He said: Al-Mu'tazz was generous in character, broad-minded, possessed literature and understanding, and spoke good poetry. He loved Yunus bin Bugha and could not bear to be without him. He and Yunus bin Bugha were among the most handsome faces and most beautiful of people. There was no one among the Caliphs of Banu Abbas with a more handsome face than Al-Amin and Al-Mu'tazz; they were proverbial for their beauty and comeliness. 'Arib said: 'I was a maidservant for Muhammad al-Amin among the count of servants; I wore a tunic and a belt, stood at his head, and perhaps gave him drink. My age then was seventeen years. He was the most beautiful of Allah's creation; we never saw a male or female like him in beauty and handsomeness, along with good character.' Ahmad bin Abdullah bin Ismail al-Marakibi, who was the son of their client, said: 'Where was Al-Mu'tazz compared to him? For we saw him and did not see Al-Amin.' She said: 'Al-Mu'tazz had a glimpse of him, but as for being his equal, he was not.' He said: Al-Mu'tazz's attachment to Yunus bin Bugha was an attachment of childhood. He would not part from him nor endure his absence. He has many poems about him, among which is: 'I knew the medicine of medicine for my pain... But I did not know the medicine of cunning and deception. I panicked at love, yet for fever I was patient... Indeed, I wonder at my patience and my panic. Whoever is distracted from his beloved by pain... My pain does not distract me from your love.' Al-Mu'tazz was drinking in a garden full of wild thyme (nammam), and among the thyme were anemones. Yunus bin Bugha approached wearing a green tunic. Al-Mu'tazz said: 'I likened the redness of his cheek in his robe... To the anemones in the wild thyme.' Then he said: 'Complete the verse.' Banan the singer hastened and said: 'And his figure when he appears bending... To the branch in softness and goodness of stature.' He said: 'Sing it now.' So he composed a melody for it and sang it to him. He said: Al-Mu'tazz drank one day while Yunus bin Bugha was before him pouring drink, and the companions and singers were before him. He had prepared robes of honor and prizes. Bugha entered and said: 'O my master, the mother of your servant Yunus is dying, and she desires to see him.' So he gave him permission, and he left. Al-Mu'tazz became languid and changed, then drowsy and slept. The companions slept, and the singers dispersed. When it was sunset and Al-Mu'tazz returned to his sitting place, Yunus returned with candles before him. When Al-Mu'tazz saw him, he called for a rotl (a large cup) and drank it, and gave him the like to drink. Then the drinking companions returned, and the singers sang to him, and the gathering returned to better than it was. Al-Mu'tazz said: 'You are absent so I am not happy... I wish you would not leave. Even if you tortured me... by not being generous [with yourself]. So I became between these two... I have a liver that is wounded. Despite that, O my master... your nearness is better for me.'",

    "text": "Then he said: 'Sing to this.' They began to think. Al-Mu'tazz said to Sulayman bin al-Qassar the Tanbur player: 'Woe to you! The melodies of the Tanbur are more fitting and lighter, so you sing it.' So he sang it with a melody. He [Al-Mu'tazz] gave him the dinars of the 'Khareeta' (pouch), which were one hundred Meccan dinars containing two hundred [in value], and written on every dinar of them was: 'This dinar was struck in Al-Jawsaq for the pouch of the Commander of the Faithful Al-Mu'tazz Billah.' Then he called for robes and jewels for the rest of the people. He said: Al-Mu'tazz drank a morning draught one day with Yunus bin Bugha. Two faces more beautiful than theirs were never seen. Three hours had not passed before they became drunk. Al-Mu'tazz said: 'You do not see a sight, if you wish it to be beautiful... Except a fallen one tumbling between two intoxications. The intoxication of youth and intoxication from the love of a fawn... whom you imagine, along with the one who loves him, to be two branches.' Then he ordered, and one of the singers sang it. Among his poetry about Yunus, which has a melody in the Ramal mode: 'Teach me how to shun you... despite the one I banished. And my shunning of you, O Yunus... is coupled with my death. However, Allah may know... what I reveal and what I hide. So may Allah protect me regarding you from Time... lest it comes with a calamity.' Harun bin Abdul Aziz bin Al-Mu'tamid said: Said bin Yusuf, my father's scribe, told me, saying: I was in charge of the clothing treasuries. When Al-Mu'tazz ordered something for Yunus, I would take the finest and best of what was in the treasuries for him. He used to offer me gifts, but I would not accept his gift. Perhaps he entered the treasury, and I would plane wood for him [joke with him] and jest with him. I said to him one day: 'O my master, I am your servant and a saver of your wealth, yet you honor Masrur al-Mu'tasimi with the beautiful greeting from what is before the Commander of the Faithful, while you do not honor me with the like.' He said: 'Tonight is your turn!' When it was night, he sent Wasif the servant to me with a gold tray containing peaches. I said to myself: 'Complete the greatness,' since it was from the Caliph's gathering. I took one and looked at it, and behold, it had been split, its contents removed, and replaced with kneaded musk equal to what was in it. I checked all of them, and it was a great amount. Al-Mu'tazz has regarding Yunus, when he left and returned: 'Allah knows, O my beloved, that I... since you were absent from me, am wandering and distressed. Joy approaches when a dwelling approaches you... And the purity of life disappears when you disappear.' The pledge of allegiance to Al-Mu'tazz was on Thursday, the third of Muharram, year 252, and he was deposed on the third remaining day of Rajab, year 255. He was killed five days after being deposed, and his age was twenty-four years, six months, and fourteen days. He said: Qabiha had incited Al-Mu'tazz against the Turks and said: 'O my son, kill them in every place.' She brought out to him the shirt of his father Al-Mutawakkil, stained with his blood. He said: 'O mother! Put it away, or else the shirt will become two shirts.' Ahmad bin Hamdun mentioned, saying: Al-Mu'tazz built a room in Al-Jawsaq in the Complete Courtyard; his mother designed it for him and modeled its walls and ceilings, so it was the most beautiful room seen. He said: Al-Mu'tazz invited us to it, so we were in the best day seen for joy. Behind the curtain was a female singer singing the best singing I had ever known. He said: We were in that state when a servant entered upon us carrying a tray with a cover. He placed it in the middle of the room. In Al-Mu'tazz's hand was a cup; he drank it and we drank. Then he said to the servant: 'Lift the cover.' Behold, the head of Al-Musta'in was on the tray. When I saw it, I gasped and wept. Al-Mu'tazz said to me: 'O son of a whore, what is this? Is it as if you felt pity for him?' My mind returned to me, and I composed myself and said: 'It was not for pity, but I remembered death!' He ordered the boy to return the cover and remove the tray. He removed it. It seemed as if a languor entered Al-Mu'tazz, as well as everyone present, and we dispersed from the state of joy we were in. He said: While we were like that, we heard a commotion behind the curtain that frightened us. Behold, a woman screaming and another woman cursing the screaming one. The screaming one was saying: 'O people, you took me by force, then you bring me the head of my master and place it before me!' We heard the sound of the oud being used to strike her head. He said: The one cursing and hitting her was Qabiha, and the girl was one of Al-Musta'in's maids. He said: We departed from the gathering in the ugliest departure, and what we were in was spoiled for us. Only a few days passed until the Turks assaulted Al-Mu'tazz and killed him. Then we were called to look at him, so we entered upon him in that room, and behold, he was stretched out in its center, dead. \n\n**Dayr Marihanna (Monastery of Marihanna)**",

    "text": "This monastery is beside Tikrit, on the Tigris. It is large, populated, with many cells and monks, frequented and sought after. It is never devoid of those seeking pleasure and picnickers, nor of a traveler dismounting at it. For everyone who visits it, there is a standing hospitality according to the guest's status, which they do not neglect. It has farms, abundant yields, orchards, and vineyards. It belongs to the Nestorians. At its gate is the hermitage of Abdun the Monk, a man of the Melkites, who built the hermitage and settled in it, so it became known by him. He is currently the one in charge of the monastery and the caretaker of it and those in it. He built a building beside it for passersby to stay, where he establishes hospitality for them and improves their entertainment. Poetry has been recited about this monastery, describing its goodness and pleasantness. Among that is the saying of Amr bin Abdul Malik al-Warraq: 'I see my heart has yearned... for the monastery of Marihanna. To its spacious gardens... to its singing pool. To a gazelle of mankind... who hunts mankind and Jinn. To a branch of the willow... for which my heart has gone mad. To the most beautiful of Allah's creation... whether he chants holiness or sings. When the morning dawned... we broached a jar between us. When the cup circulated... we circulated a melody between us. And when the night-talkers slept... we slept and embraced.' This Amr was among the dissolute libertines, engrossed in idleness and loss, infatuated with beardless boys, and throwing himself into monasteries. He has much poetry in licentiousness and the description of wine. We have mentioned of it what befits the book. Among his poetry is his saying: 'And a favorite in whom is destruction... I paid dearly for her with destruction. I wasted on her what I earned... and what I collected of property. I did not cease until I attained her... in a house of shaky wood. And a Karkhi wine... red from the water of grapes. I drank it deeply among youths... who are not on the religion of the Arabs. In a company who mastered licentiousness... in pleasure and delight. They made licentiousness a veil... for those who blame regarding ranks. Prayer passes them by... and intoxication is in their nerves. So if one wakes up... he is in pursuit of it. And if their prayers pass... they pray Jumada in Rajab.' Among his poetry in licentiousness also: 'O asker about me... I am not of the people of righteousness. I am a suspicious human... I desire the intercourse of the beautiful ones. I have divided time into two days... for debauchery and for wine. I do not care who blames me... I do not obey destiny when it looms.' And of his licentiousness also: 'If you do not drink wine and do not sodomize... then you, by my life, and the donkey are equal. And if you do not fill a house with whores and your bedding... does not spend the night on the ground without a cover. And if you are not a gambling slave at chess... and at backgammon you fulfill the bet. And if you are not quarrelsome in the game of date pits... robbing money or being a match. And if you do not keep a dog, a bow, and pellets... and a pigeon tower, prosperity will not hit you. And if you do not know what life is and do not find pleasure... then you are a donkey in which there is no doubt. So if you do not realize a life you were ignorant of... then take it as long as there is survival in you. And beware of ceasing from overflowing drunkenness... making your evening morning and the morning evening. And sodomize whoever you meet of the time among them, and let there not be... refusal from you if they give to you.' \n\n**Dayr Sabba'i (Monastery of Sabba'i)**\nThis monastery is east of Tikrit, opposite it, overlooking the Tigris. It is pleasant and populated, having a wondrous spacious exterior and farms around it on a river that pours from the Tigris into the Ishaqi, which is a large canal. Those near it visit this monastery during its festivals and the days of spring, as it is then a beautiful sight, containing a large crowd of its monks and priests. A poet said about it: 'The heart yearned for a monastery in Tikrit... between Sabba'i [and another place], and the priest of the monastery is an efreet (demon).' \n\n**Al-Dayr Al-A'la (The Upper Monastery)**",

    "text": "This monastery is in Mosul, at its highest point, overlooking the Tigris and the waterwheels. It is a large, populated monastery, proverbial for the delicacy of its air and the beauty of its view. It is said that the Christians have no monastery like it due to the gospels and places of worship it contains. It has many cells for its monks. It has a staircase carved into the mountain leading to the Tigris, about one hundred steps, upon which water is drawn from the Tigris. Below the monastery is a large spring that flows into the Tigris. It has a time of the year when people visit it to bathe in it, and they mention that it cures scabies and itching and benefits those with ringworm and chronic illnesses. Palm Sunday (Sha'anin) in this monastery is beautiful; people go out to it and stay there for days drinking. Whoever of the governors passes by Mosul stays there. Poets have spoken about this monastery and described its beauty and pleasantness. Al-Tharwani said about it: 'Give me wine in the morning... a ruddy coffee-colored wine. And drink a morning draught in the Upper Monastery... on Palm Sunday. Indeed, whoever does not drink a morning draught today... will not find success. Then adorn me with olive [branches]... and palm leaves as a sash. In Palm Sunday, even if... I meet disgrace in that. Honor the banners and the monks... and the beautiful crosses. And make the church and the palace... all a resting place. Not like one who jokes with fame... and robes a joke. Or leave fame and stick to... everyone who desires righteousness. And stick to the Friday prayer and the early morning... in it and the evening.' Al-Ma'mun passed by this monastery on his way out to Damascus and stayed there for days. His stay coincided with the feast of Palm Sunday. Ahmad bin Sadaqa mentioned, saying: We went out with Al-Ma'mun and stayed at the Upper Monastery in Mosul for its goodness and integrity. The feast of Palm Sunday came, so Al-Ma'mun sat in a beautiful place in it overlooking the Tigris, the desert, and the orchards, watching from it who entered the monastery. The monastery was decorated that day with the best attire. Its monks and priests came out to the altar, surrounded by their young men with censers in their hands, wearing crosses and sashed with embroidered kerchiefs. Al-Ma'mun saw that and admired it. Then the people dispersed to their cells and offerings, and those with them of the slave girls and boys turned to Al-Ma'mun, each holding a gift of the aromatic plants of their season, and groups of them holding cups containing types of drink. He drew them near and began taking a greeting from this one and that one, having been enamored by what he saw of them—and there was none among us but was in this state. During that, he was drinking and the music was playing. Then he ordered the bringing out of those with him of his sash-wearing (Christian-style) maidservants. Twenty maidservants came out to him like full moons, wearing brocade, with gold crosses on their necks, holding palm leaves and olives in their hands. He said: 'O Ahmad, you have said verses about these; sing them to me.' They are: 'Gazelles like dinars... beautiful in the chambers. Palm Sunday revealed them... to us in belts (Zunnars). They have arranged side-locks... like the tails of hornets. And they approached with waists... like the waists of wasps.' Then he brought out Ni'am, his slave girl—she was a young servant—and she sang: 'You claimed that I am unjust so you abandoned me... and shot into my liver a penetrating arrow. Yes, I wronged you, so forgive and overlook... This is the station of the one seeking protection and refuge.' He was delighted, drank, and asked for the song to be repeated several times. Then he said to Al-Yazidi: 'Have you seen anything better than what we are in?' He said: 'Yes, O Commander of the Faithful: That you thank the One who granted you this, so He increases it for you and preserves it for you.' He said: 'May Allah bless you, for you have reminded in the place of remembrance.' Then he ordered thirty thousand dirhams, and gave it as charity immediately. Beside this monastery is the shrine of Amr bin al-Hamiq al-Khuza'i, and a mosque built by the Banu Hamdan connected to the grave. Amr bin al-Hamiq had companionship [with the Prophet] and was one of the companions of Ali bin Abi Talib, Allah's blessings be upon him, and witnessed all his battles. Muawiyah sought him for a long time while he moved from place to place. Then he was found in Mosul; he had developed dropsy and his illness intensified. Abdul Rahman bin Umm al-Hakam al-Thaqafi, Muawiyah's nephew, guided [soldiers] to him. They found him in a cave in Mosul and killed him, and carried his head to Muawiyah. It was the first head carried in Islam from one city to another. His body was buried in this place.",

    "text": "His wife, Amna bint al-Sharid, was in Damascus, and Muawiyah imprisoned her for a long time. When Amr's head was brought to him, he sent it to Amna in the prison and said to the messenger: 'Throw it in her lap and memorize what she says.' When he came to her, she was terrified by it and bent over kissing it. Then she said: 'O loss! In a house of humiliation, you exiled him for a long time and gifted him to me killed. So welcome to one whom I did not despise, and I am not forgetful of him. Tell Muawiyah: May Allah orphan your child, make your family lonely without you, and may He not forgive your sin!' The messenger returned with what she said. He [Muawiyah] ordered for her, so she was brought. With him was a group including Iyas bin Shurahbil, who had a protrusion in his jaws from the bone of his tongue. Muawiyah said to her: 'O enemy of Allah! Are you the owner of the speech?' She said: 'Yes, not retracting it, nor apologizing for it, nor denying it. And, by my life, I strove in the supplication, and I strive, Allah willing. Allah is behind the servants, and Allah is behind you with vengeance.' Muawiyah refrained. Iyas said: 'Kill this one, for her husband was not more deserving of killing than she.' She said: 'What is wrong with you, woe to you? Between your jaws is the body of a frog, yet you order him to kill me as my husband was killed yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land, and you do not want to be of the reformers.' Muawiyah and the group laughed, and shame appeared on Iyas. Then Muawiyah said to her: 'Get out away from me, and let me not hear of you in any part of Sham!' She said: 'I will leave you, for Sham is not a homeland to me, and I will not turn in it to a close friend or a dwelling. My calamity in it has been great, and my eye has not been refreshed in it. I am not returning to you, nor praising you where I was.' He signaled to her with his hand to leave. She said: 'Wonder at Muawiyah! He extends against me the edge of his tongue and points at me with his finger.' When she left, Muawiyah said: 'Carry to her what will cut her tongue from me and hurry her to her land.' She received what was ordered for her and left intending Kufa. When she reached Homs, she died there. \n\n**Dayr Yunus bin Matta (Monastery of Jonah son of Matthew)**\nThis monastery is attributed to Jonah son of Matthew the Prophet, peace be upon him, and was built in his name. It is on the eastern side of Mosul, between it and the Tigris are two farsakhs. Its location is known as Nineveh, and Nineveh is the city of Jonah, peace be upon him. Its land is all flowers and anemones. It has a beautiful, elegant appearance in the days of spring, and it is a destination. Below the monastery is a spring known as the Spring of Jonah. People visit this place for several reasons: among them recreation and play, among them seeking blessings from its location, and among them bathing in the spring beneath it. The Jews, in the days of Al-Husayn bin Abdullah bin Hamdan, infiltrated one of them who entered the temple and desecrated it. The news reached Ibn Hamdan, so he gathered every Jew in Mosul and confiscated a large amount of money from them. Abu Shas Munir said about it: 'O Monastery of Jonah, the rains have watered your direction... until you are seen fresh, smiling with blossoms. Water in Najir [hot summer] never cured a thirst... as your cold water cured the heat of my heart. Nor did a sorrowful one with illness settle in it... except that illness dissolved from him. I seek forgiveness from Allah for a sudden attack by a coquettish one... about whom the pen ran against me in your quarter.' This Abu Shas was among the most natural of people, with beautiful poetry, frequently describing wine, sticking to monasteries, throwing himself into them, and fascinated by their monks and those therein. From his poetry in which he described wine and was witty is his saying: 'Forbearance and dignity lent you... a robe of silence that is not returned. So rise to the wine and test it... when the abodes settle with you. And the birds sang in gardens... whose branches were adorned with greenness. From that which kings preserved... they are the great masters. When it appears while darkness resides... the place of darkness becomes day. As if they, with the wine, are a caravan... led in the darkness by a fire.' And from his beautiful poetry is his saying: 'Do not turn away from the daughter of the vine... by my father! For in it is the health of the body. And know that if you are fond of other than it... clouds of worry will pour upon you. And if you drink, be alert to it... so that the goodness of the taste becomes clear. If there were no rest in drinking it... except deliverance from the hand of grief.' He also said: 'O blamer, there is no way against the likes of me... and your blame regarding wine is impossible. O blamer, do not blame us for loving it... for our reproach regarding it is long. Both of us claim knowledge in wine... so leave me, I will not speak and you do not speak. Is not my mount the waist of a boy... and the connection of my fingertips a cup of chilled wine?'",

    "text": "'If the daughters of the vine are my drink... and my snack is his beautiful handsome face. I am safe with these two from the outcome of nights... and what the blamer says is easy on me. And one apologizing to me with half an eye... having a messenger from the break of its glance. I turned the cup away from him when he sang... although his tongue was heavy from it. Give me rest, for the Pleiades have risen... and every night of yours has been taken by a ghoul [calamity] from you.'\n\n**Dayr al-Shayatin (Monastery of Devils)**\nThis monastery is west of the Tigris, in the district of Balad, between two mountains, at the mouth of the valley. It has a beautiful view and a majestic location. Its air is thin and gentle, its cells are populated and full of trees, and its land has many gardens. It has a wall surrounding it, and a lookout on the roof of its altar overlooking the Tigris and the mountain. People visit it to drink there, and it is one of the places for idle people and locations for those of licentiousness. Al-Khabbaz al-Baladi said about it: 'Monks of a monastery gave me pure wine to drink... like the devils in the Monastery of Devils. They walked to the wine the walk of the Rook [in chess] and turned away... and the wine walked with them the walk of the Queens [Farazin].' Ubadah, when Al-Mutawakkil exiled him to Mosul, used to go to Dayr al-Shayatin and drink there, and he would not leave it. He fell in love with a boy from the monks in the monastery, who was one of the most beautiful people in face and figure. He became infatuated with him and mad about him, and stuck to the monastery for his sake. He kept deceiving him, treating him gently, and giving to him until he stripped the monk from the monastery and left with him. The monks of the monastery realized what Ubadah had done in corrupting the boy, so they wanted to kill him by throwing him from the top of the monastery into the valley. He realized their intent and fled, never returning to the place. Ubadah was among the most pleasant of people, lightest in spirit, and quickest in wit. His father was one of Al-Ma'mun's cooks, and he was with him, so he turned out skilled in cooking. Then his father died, so he became effeminate (Mukhannath) and became a leader in rogueries and licentiousness. He was described to Al-Ma'mun, while he was then a youth, so he summoned him. When he stood before him, he made jokes, imitated, and jested, so Al-Ma'mun found him agreeable. He said: 'Take him to Zubaydah so she can see him and laugh at him.' So they took him to her. When he entered upon her, he found her on a saddle of a Takhtaj (palanquin/seat), and at her head was a maid shooing flies with a palm-leaf fan. Ubadah said: 'O my lady, it is as if you are from the nougat of the pool!' She laughed at him and found him agreeable, so he stayed with her for days. She gave him gifts and clothed him, and she could hardly bear to be without him. He said: Al-Ma'mun sat one day and ordered the meats, animals, and what is needed of cooking utensils to be brought. He said to the drinking companions: 'Let each one of you cook a pot.' He also cooked a pot, and his brother Abu Ishaq cooked a pot. Scents wafted from it that overcame the scents of their pots in goodness and aroma. They were amazed at that, and Ubadah was present, so he envied him. He said: 'If you want to increase the goodness of your pot, pour into it a saucer of caper sauce (Kamikh Kabar).' So he took a saucer of caper sauce and poured it into the pot. The moment he poured the saucer, foul smells wafted from it. Al-Ma'mun said: 'Woe to you! What is this foul smell?' Ubadah said: 'The smell of your brother the cook's pot!' He said: 'What did you throw into it so that it returned to this smell after goodness?' He said: 'A saucer of caper sauce which Ubadah indicated.' He said: 'Did you not know that if you introduce a dead body to a living body, it corrupts it?' Al-Mu'tasim held a grudge against Ubadah for this. When Al-Mu'tasim took power, he ordered his killing, then said: 'This dog does not have the worth to be killed, but exile him.' So he was exiled. When Al-Wathiq took power, he returned him, so he was with him and then with Al-Mutawakkil after him. Then Al-Mutawakkil got angry with him and exiled him to Mosul. Abu Hazim the Jurist said, when Ubadah was mentioned: 'How witty he was.' It was said: 'And how?' He said: 'Al-Mutawakkil had exiled him. When he arrived in Mosul, his creditors followed him and demanded payment, and brought him before Ali bin Ibrahim al-Ghumari, who was the judge of Mosul. He swore to one, then to another, then to another. Ali bin Ibrahim said: \"Woe to you! Do you think these people conspired to wrong you? Fear Allah and return to yourself. If it is hardship, then there should be a respite.\" He said: \"You spoke the truth, may I be your ransom! Not all of them claimed falsehood, nor did all of them claim truth, but I pushed away with [swearing by] Allah what I cannot bear.\"' Then Al-Mutawakkil brought him back. He was among the quickest of people in wit and fastest in answer. Al-Mutawakkil said to Ubadah one day: 'Leave effeminacy so I can marry you off.' He said: 'Are you a Caliph or a matchmaker?' Ibn Hamdun said to him: 'O Ubadah, if you performed Hajj, you would earn reward and people would see you with such a blessed face.' He said: 'Listen, woe to you, to this rogue: He wants to exile me from Samarra on a camel!' Di'bil said to him one day: 'By Allah, I will satirize you!' He said: 'By Allah, if you do, I will bring out your mother in the shadow play!' Sa'd bin Ibrahim the Scribe said: 'I said to him one day: Can there be an effeminate man without prostitution?' He said: 'Yes. But he won't be cute. He would be like a judge without a skullcap!'",

He said: Ubadah entered the bathhouse one day without a waistcloth, exposed and unashamed, and in the bathhouse was a dignified sheikh. He said: 'Woe to you! Do you not feel shame? Cover yourself with your hand!' He said: 'What should I cover? It is but the gift of Mecca: two eyeballs and a toothpick!' Ali bin Yahya al-Munajjim said: Ubadah said one day to Al-Mutawakkil, while Yahya bin Aktham the Judge was present: 'O Commander of the Faithful, tell Yahya to teach me the obligatory duties of crucifixion (Solb - pun on crucifixion/backbone/loins).' Al-Mutawakkil said to Yahya: 'You hear him.' He said, knowing that Al-Mutawakkil had winked at Ubadah to joke with him: 'He asked for the impossible, O Commander of the Faithful.' He said: 'How?' He said: 'Because the poet says: \"Indeed, he whom you educated in boyhood... Is like the wood watered during its planting.\" And this is an old man; education will not succeed with him. But if he has a young male son, let him bring him to me, I will teach him.' Ubadah looked at him and said: 'O Judge, if you were from the people of our trade, no one could overpower you.' He said: 'I am not of the people of your trade, and no one has power over me.' He said: Ubadah went out one day at dawn to the bathhouse and met a boy from the children of the Turks. He gave him ten dirhams and said: 'Cut your uncle's affair!' While the boy was upon him behind the alley, an old woman looked down from a room of hers, saw them, and shouted: 'Thieves!' Ubadah said: 'O old woman of evil! The breach is in my anus, what are you shouting about?' Abu Hazim the Judge mentioned, saying: I was staying in Damascus with Ibn Mudabbir, and no letter would come to him except he read it to me. A letter arrived from Sa'id al-Rasah, a deputy of his in Surra Man Ra'a (Samarra). He read it, smiled, and did not give it to me. I asked him about what was in it. He said: Sa'id wrote to me mentioning that he was standing at Al-Mutawakkil's door, when Musa bin Abdul Malik came out, his face changed. He said to his servant: 'Carry one thousand dirhams to Ubadah and say: Do not repeat increasing your meddling.' I asked about the news, and it was said: Musa entered upon Al-Mutawakkil while he was sitting by the Pool of the Lions, and Ubadah was before him speaking and jesting. Al-Mutawakkil said: 'O Musa, Ubadah has given me a headache, will you not relieve me of him?' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, throw him into the lion's pool!' Ubadah said: 'Yes, throw me into the lion's pool, and carry him to the Lion of Damascus so he can extract the money from him.' Musa's face changed and calamity befell him, so he sent Ubadah money to silence him. \n\n**'Umr al-Za'faran (Saffron Monastery)**\nThis monastery is in Nusaybin, facing its eastern side, in the mountain, and the mountain overlooks the town. It is among the described monasteries and locations mentioned for goodness and beauty. Around it are trees and vineyards, and in it are gushing springs. It has many cells and monks. Its wine is described and carried to Nusaybin and elsewhere. It is never devoid of people of revelry and play, so it and its surrounding areas are populated by those who visit it. In this mountain are three other monasteries, in a single row, the most beautiful thing in view and majestic in location, which are: 'Umr al-Za'faran, Mar Awji, and Mar Yuhanna. The Great Monastery ('Umr al-Kabir) in the place is one of the parks of the world. Below the mountain is Al-Harmas, which is the river of Nusaybin, and springs gushing from the base of the mountain; the place is known as Ras al-Ma (Head of the Water). This mountain is the beginning of Tur Abdin, and it is three farsakhs from Nusaybin. This river runs between two mountains. On its banks are vineyards and trees. When it reaches Nusaybin, it splits into two branches. One passes by the Sinjar Gate, watering the gardens there and pouring into the Khabur. The other turns to the east of the town, turning mills there and watering the gardens and what is there. Mus'ab the Scribe has [poetry] regarding the Monastery of 'Umr al-Za'faran: 'The plots of 'Umr al-Za'faran were populated... by noble, excellent youths. With every youth yearning for youthful passion... loving the drinking of aged jars. With every youth inclining towards amusements... and the sounds of the third and second strings. We remained circulating the cups in it... on a garden like the engraving of Khosrow's carpets. And branches leaning with fruits... close to the picker, hanging low. The winds bend them as... the gazelle of my garden bends with the beauty of his stature. And rivers flowing sequentially... whose whiteness shines like pearls. And birds, if they sing to you, they suffice... instead of Ibn al-Mariqi and Banan. We answer them when they wail with sorrow... with the laughter of jugs and bottles. And gazelles whose pastures are my heart... saddened me from them what has saddened me. And their sons, and Yuhanna and Sha'ya... possessors of beneficence and beautiful forms.'",

    "text": "'I was satisfied with them as my share of the world... I became rich through them without the fair maidens. I kiss this one and kiss the cheek of that one... and this is a helper, compliant in rein. This is life, not [the lover's] basin and distance... nor describing landmarks and dwellings.' This Mus'ab was among the most openly dissolute people, most excessive in licentiousness and obscenity, infatuated with beardless boys, and throwing himself into taverns and monasteries. His poems are all about boys, not crossing this meaning to another. We present from that what is considered witty and salty of his meanings. From his poetry is his saying: 'I am the sodomite rogue, my religion is one... and I am desirous of earning sins. I sodomize and do not commit adultery; so whoever is a sodomite... I am a companion to him until the Resurrection. I follow the religion of the Sheikh Yahya bin Aktham... and I deviate from the religion of adulterers. And [I love] one like a willow branch in the garb of a rogue... when he appears to the eye, the mind wanders away. He has a snort; if I say: Connect me with a visit... the forelocks turn gray for it, O son of the noble. I invited for him a gang from the people of Lot... to whom difficulties submit in calamities. He said, while the tuning peg choked in his throat... the saying of one upon whom paths were difficult: A generous one whom time struck with a misfortune... and which generous one have misfortunes not struck?' From his poetry also: 'Advice from one who possessed an ear and an eye... came to you, and you will be happy if you do it. You must, when you meet [boys], have a good cheerful face... and be of the most dignified bearing among mankind and jinn. Do not leave fingers without rings... and ply people with traditions (Hadith) deeply. Admonish them and forbid them from abominations... and do not leave crying when you admonish. And be a brother to the father of the one you love so that... it is said: The brother of his father, and you have succeeded. And if you see your condition among people... and cannot be patient, then you are a thief if you look. And if they notice, look down then think... as if you did not intend a look. And treat the beardless boys with good gentleness... and do not leave the creeping [touch] if you get drunk. My advice, O Sa'id, do not leave it... for you are among the philosophers if you accept it.' He also said: 'I abandoned my licentiousness so I rested from blame... and I was, in persistence, without equal. O Ibn Yaman, have you heard of a lover... counted among the ascetics among those who passed before me? Did you not see me when I went out glorifying [God]... with the bearing of Abu Dharr and the debauchery of Abu Jahl? I am humble in my walk and turn away my gaze... and my prayer rug on my face is like the Baghle dirham [mark of prostration]. I enjoin good, not out of piety... how could I, when my deeds do not verify my words? I say when I meet people: Fear God... and if they knew my state, my killing would be lawful for them. My inkwell is the head of hypocrisy, and my notebook... and my sandals at dawn or going are my feet. I aim for a jurist, his jurisprudence is not my concern... but the beardless boys are with him, the gathering of my union. O how many a deceived one I deceived with my notebook... but when prudence turned him, my deeds opposed him. And how many a beardless boy whose father said to him... Stick to this one, for he is of the people of intellect. He flees with him from associating with a rogue... like one fleeing from the heat of wounds to death. So I gave him ample sodomy and was not found incapable... and I was to him in lowering [wings] and softness like a husband. And I softened him with kindness after hardness... just as the trainers soften the difficult camel.' He also said: 'And a woman saying, hoping for my righteousness: Until when? ... I said to her: As long as there is a beardless boy on earth. She said: You have worn out in error, striving... mounts of debauchery in which you go back and forth. Do you weep for a young one after a young one? I do not see... your weeping ending until time ends. O blamer, were it not for the beardless boys, I would have become a worshiper... they destroyed my religion upon me and corrupted it. People called me an ascetic when they saw... my humility; nay, in asceticism I have become most ascetic. I set up traps for them under humility... and gentleness sometimes has praiseworthy consequences. I resembled the ascetics, and war is deception... and I showed off with the rosary while the palm is tied [in contract/betrothal?].' He also said:",

    "text": "'Every life without religion is corrupt... and the beardless boys, O Ibn Yaman, corrupted my religion. How many repentances, followed by another I repented... so my time is not safe regarding my religion. If you secured me from what my soul fears... from them in Baghdad one day, I would seek refuge in China. I have asked an expert among their merchants... and he remained informing me with good description. He said: In China are colors [of boys] for which... hard hearts soften, and a matter not lowly. A sayer said: Take refuge in the House of Allah. I said to him... Who will save me from the beardless boys in Ihram? If mounds [hips] appear with waist-wrappers twisted on them... standing as a target for one who shoots me with a glance. Who is for me if they crowd me in their Tawaf... there my conscience reveals every hidden thing. I have no protection from the beardless boys except Allah... Lord of the Mathani [Quran verses], Ta-Ha, and the Ta-Sins. I was before today immersed in asceticism... my love for them mixed with the bearing of Ibn Sirin. I approach with the eye of a pious man, the filling of whose eye... is love for every pure-cheeked, soft one. So now I have repented, so my share of them is my look... I seek forgiveness from Allah, and kissing at the time.' He also said: 'I wept for my body in its diminution... I did not weep for a trace, nor a quarter, nor a house. And a rogue, haughty in his disdain... like a branch, associating with debauchees and rogues. I did not cease with him with my plotting and deception until... his recognition of the truth became denial. I assassinated the boy's mind with the cup, knocking it... with wine, following it with poetry and night-talk. Until when the night lent his soul... and sleep seized hearing and sight. I crept walking on palms touching him... like the walk of one stealing secrets to hear. And my pen returned moving quickly on his parchment... while the night cast curtains on the horizons. He said when slumber cleared from his eye... and he saw a waistband untied and traces: O sleeper of the night, happy at its beginning... indeed accidents may knock at dawn.' And he also has: 'And one dozing over the cup from his drunkenness... I violated what he preserved of his back. I kissed him two hundred kisses... and I was not satisfied except on his mouth. And how difficult it is for me, despite what pleased me... of the power over his affair. When he woke up, I saw him out of... rage coming out of his skin. He had plotted against me in pouring drink... but it was returned to his throat.' And he also has: 'O beardless boys, I have advised you... Fear from Allah the excess of His vengeance. If a beardless boy attacks and is haughty over... his lover, the outcome of his attack is: That Allah sends upon his beauties... hair, extinguishing the light of his splendor. The punishment of the beardless boy whose sins multiplied... is in the emergence of his beard. People deny him after knowing him... and they have advised each other of his long rejection. This is the Prophet of God before you... the eyes of his brothers denied him. And after him, where is the beauty of Abu... Bakr's face and his glances with his temptation? The temple hair has curled over his cheek... upon whiteness from beneath his redness. He became to people, after his glory... like Qu'ays at the door of his aunt.' \n\n**'Umr Ahwisha**\nThe interpretation of Ahwisha in Syriac is 'The Recluse'. This monastery is in Sa'irt (Siirt), and Sa'irt is a large city in Diyar Bakr, near Arzan, and the monastery overlooks Arzan. It is large and great, containing four hundred monks in cells. Around it are orchards and vineyards. It is the ultimate in construction, good location, and abundance of fruits and wines. Wine is carried from it to the mentioned cities. Near it is a great spring that turns three mills. Beside it is a river known as the River of the Romans. This monastery is intended from every place for picnicking and drinking. Libertines and those seeking pleasure prevail over it more than its inhabitants. Al-Labbadi the poet has [verses] about it: 'And youths like your concern from people... light in going early and returning. I rose with them, while the curtain of night was cast... and the light of morning had clipped wings. We intend, in the monastery of Ahwisha, a gazelle... strange in beauty like the bright moon.'",

    "text": "'We endured the night journey longing for him... so we met the morning with the morning. We settled in a beautiful, elegant dwelling... populated in its regions with what we desire. We divided the time in it for an evening drink... upon the beautiful face and for a morning drink. We remained between basil and wine... and strings helping us, eloquent. And time aided us with what we wanted... so we returned with success and victory.' This Al-Labbadi was nicknamed Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Muhammad, among the wittiest and funniest of people, and those of obscenity and licentiousness. He was named Al-Labbadi because he always wore red felt over his clothes. Abu Ali al-Awaraji mentioned that he was in charge of Ardabil. He said: 'I assessed twenty thousand dinars justly upon them according to their conditions at one time. Al-Labbadi was among those upon whom the assessment fell. Twenty dinars were written in his name.' He said: 'While I was sitting in the Diwan collecting, a man entered upon me whose face was plastered with red clay, wearing red felt, a red turban, a red staff in his hand, and red boots on his feet. He greeted, stood, and began reciting a poem he had composed, saying in it: \"If the Emir is in need... of poets in noble lineage. Days have destroyed him until... he sought Iraq from the dogs.\" I said: Who is this? They said: This is Abu Bakr al-Labbadi the poet. I raised his status, then asked him about his poem regarding Ahmad bin al-Hasan al-Madharai and his news with him. He said to me: I sought him and found him traveling towards Qazvin. I stood for him on his way behind a stone, in this attire you see on me. When he approached me, I came out to him. I said: As you see, [time] has made me. He said: What? I said: ........... ... My cutting across the desolate wastes. I cut them time and time... again, by night journey, they cut me. I travel by night on a surpassing [beast]... in her journey, she did not betray. She knows no humiliation nor... was she tied by the fold of a halter. I run with her, traversing blindly... to you, O son of Al-Hasan. Seeking help, so help me... against the vicissitudes of time. For, by the Lord of the Corner... my walking has weakened my corner (strength). How many a gulp has it made me gulp... and a choking has it made me choke. As if it seeks me... in its bitterness with grudges. Praise be to Allah who... turned the turn from my lowly time. O you from whom the fruits... of generosity are picked by the picker. Your generosity from the highest peaks... calls with a declared voice. Come to the son of Al-Hasan... Come to the brilliant full moon. Come to the one whose generosity... is like the downpour of rain water. So I came running, by the One who... from His Throne granted me success. For the love of the family of the Chosen One... and their love saved me. Take them, rhymes... in which I exercised my wits. Your wearing them is better than... wearing the weave of Aden.\" He said: So he ordered ten thousand dirhams for me, and mounted me on a beast with its saddle and bridle.' Abu Ali said: 'So I signed to the collector to give him a clearance for what was assessed upon him. He took the clearance, thanked me, and left.' Al-Labbadi praised Abu al-Qasim Yusuf bin Diwdadh bin Abi al-Saj, so he went to his house. When he entered the vestibule, the doorkeeper spoke to him, denying his attire and felt: 'What thing are you?' He said: 'A poet, and I have praised the Emir.' He said to someone before him: 'Zabtara!' So he 'Zabtara-ed' him (mocked/dismissed him with a noise), and he left. He wrote to Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Ahmad, scribe of Al-Afshin: 'I praised the Emir Abu Qasim... and my soul was waiting for his gift. With praise like the weaving of spring gardens... which the dew covered when it came early. They said: A magnanimous one, abundant in structure... abundant in favors, yet I did not see him. When I reached his house... I was rewarded for his praise with \"Zabtara\". I denied my prize from them... and it was, by my father's life, objectionable. I enabled myself for accidents... and became certain I was a victim of greed. So weep for poetry and noble deeds... and call out to them from the graveyard. For Allah has heated the eye of a man... who is told today \"How poetic he is!\" So is there, O Muhammad, any gift... that moistens the uvula or the throat? Whoever does good, sees good... and whoever does evil, sees evil.'",

    "text": "Abu Bakr said: 'Yes, by Allah, and with honor!' He sent him a note for fifty dinars to the treasurer. The treasurer refused to hand over the payment unless he stayed with him. So he stayed with him, and he gave him the fifty dinars and five from himself. Then Abu Bakr took him to Abu al-Qasim Yusuf and told him his story. He laughed at it, heard his poetry, gave to him, mounted him, and clothed him. \n\n**Dayr Fiq (Monastery of Fiq)**\nThis monastery is at the top of the Aqaba of Fiq, between it and the Lake of Tiberias, in a mountain connected to the Aqaba, carved into the stone. It is populated by those in it and those Christians who visit it due to its great status among them; others visit it for picnicking and drinking there. The Christians claim it is the first monastery built for Christianity, and that the Messiah, peace be upon him, used to seek shelter there, and from there he called the Disciples. In it is a stone they mentioned the Messiah used to sit on. Everyone who enters the place breaks a piece from that stone for blessing. This monastery was made in the place in the name of the Messiah, peace be upon him. Abu Nuwas mentions it: 'By your Hajj intending Mar Sargis... then the Monastery of Nawbahar, then the Monastery of Fiq.' It is a witty poem, addressing a Christian boy he loved. Its beginning is: 'By the baptism of the Old Monastery... by its Metropolitans, by the Catholicos. By Simon, by John, by Jesus... by Mar Sargis, by the interceding priest. By the birth of the Messiah, by the day of Epiphany... by Ba'una, by the payment of rights. By Ashmuni and seven you advanced... and they did not deviate, all of them, from a path. By Saint Mary and by the day of Easter... and by the Eucharist and the old wine. And by the crosses raised by spears... shining when they flash with lightning. By your Hajj intending Mar Sargis... in the Monastery of Nawbahar, then the Monastery of Fiq. By the altar of the Church of God, the ransomed... and priests who came to it from afar. And by the bell in the churches which... prayer is established in them at sunrise. By Mary, by the Messiah, and every cub... a disciple on a firm religion. By the monks of the hermitages in its peaks... they stayed there in effort and distress. By the Gospel of Palm Sunday, the ransomed... and the play of Christians in the road. And by the great crosses when they appear... and by the belt (Zunnar) on the slender waist. And by the beauty composed in you, unless... you have mercy on my burning and the drying of my saliva. Nay, by the closeness after distance... an oath of a youth who is a lover to his sayer. You have become the adornment of every monastery... and a feast, despite your cruelty and disobedience. And your lovers have called to the Christians... announcing leaving Islam entirely.' \n\n**Dayr al-Tur (Monastery of the Mount)**\nAl-Tur is a round, elongated mountain, wide at the bottom and tapered at the top. No other mountains are attached to it, and there is only one path to it. It is between Tiberias and Al-Lajjun, overlooking the Ghor and the meadow of Al-Lajjun. The monastery is at the very peak, with a spring flowing there, and around it are vineyards that are pressed, so wine is abundant with them. It is also known as the Monastery of the Transfiguration, because the Messiah, peace be upon him, according to their claim, transfigured himself to his disciples after he was raised, until he showed them himself and they recognized him. People visit it from every place, staying there and drinking in it. Its location is beautiful, and it is among the pleasant places. Muhalhil bin Yamut bin al-Mazra' has [poetry] in it: 'I rose to the Tur among youths... quick to rise to what I love. Like your concern, of youths who spent... their inherited wealth in the path of delight. Noble of ancestors, handsome of faces... mature of minds, young of play. So which time with them did not please... and which place with them was not pleasant? I made the camels kneel at its monastery... and fulfilled what was due of its right. I settled them amidst its grapes... I give them juice of the grape to drink. And I brought them a shining moon... with whom branches sway in the dunes. We urge the cups with his songs... and the controlled Ramal [melodies] with wonder. And between that is speech that pleases... and their wading into the arts of literature. So whatever you wish of a proverb current... and of rare, selected news. O goodness of that life, if only it did not cease... and O beauty of that happiness, if only it did not vanish.'",

    "text": "Muhalhil was among those naturally gifted in poetry, engrossed in licentiousness and play, throwing himself into places of amusement and delight, sticking to taverns and monasteries. We present of his poetry what befits this book of ours. From his beautiful poetry describing gardens and urging drink is his saying: 'To the madness of love I gave my heart... so leave me, O two blamers. My delight is increasing, so in heat is the one who... blamed me for licentiousness or forbade me. The gardens have revealed to me of the flowers... strange varieties and colors. The opening narcissus appeared gazing... from eyelids of camphor with saffron. Like eyes staring in bewilderment... looking at beautiful faces. The peridot of its stalks bends... out of delight for silver and gold. The dew stood in the eye sockets of it... then died and poured down like pearls. O boy, give me drink, for the time has laughed... and the goodness of this time is complete. Bring the jars near me, line up the pitchers, urge the cups, line up the bottles. Seize the time and take advantage of life's opportunities... and do not lie, for life is fleeting.' From his beautiful poetry in this meaning is his saying: 'The time of gardens is an elegant time... and the life of licentiousness is a delicate life. The time has combined their two states... so who wakes up and who becomes alert? O you who are the request for me and the wish... and who is worthy of love from me. Turn the glance of your eye, let it graze in... the meadows of gardens, for all is pleasing. Scattered bubbles and pure water... and fresh garden and elegant flower. It has copies edited and illuminated... so majestic calligraphy and delicate meaning. Your face laughs at a beloved face... and your nose meets fragrant musk. If the flower laughs at the flower of gardens... then how is escape and where is the road? Ox-eye daisies dazzled others with it... compassionate towards narcissus and anemone. So this is a fearful, timid lover... and that is shy, and likewise the beloved. You are pleased by eyes from it that please... with their glances, and cheeks that excite. Close ones carrying the dew of moisture... so those are gold and these are carnelian. Its leaves contained its pearls... and scattered from it what it could not bear. The breeze sways its branches... so some are drunk and some are sober. So hasten with us [against] the accidents of time... for the face of accidents is a thick [shameless] face.' From his beautiful poetry is his saying: 'Repeat your drinking of the cup in what you repeat... and help, for happiness has encompassed us. And urge the morning draught by the light of the morning... for accidents are asleep away from us. Shall we not thank the deed of our day... and boast of what we are in of eternity? A sky that is generous and arranged garden... and fresh flower and swaying branch. And incense wafting and wine relaxing... and a handsome cupbearer and flute and oud. And a voice that excites and a gentle flute... and elegant life and happy luck. May God perpetuate our life for us... and may the envious not attain his wish from us.' He said in this meaning, and it was sung: 'Burdens have arrived for joy... and Shawwal urged the month of fasting [to leave]. And the cloud approached wearing robes... musk-scented having no tails. Its garden brocaded the earth so it began... spreading in it, and the earth struts. An oud shook and a flute moaned from delight... and rotls [large cups] gulped the wine. And promised fear out of caution... and hopes came near to hearts. Our days in life are a loan... urged to annihilation by terms. So seize the opportunity of time and do not... neglect, for time is an assassin.' And of what is salty in it is his saying: 'A time like youth or like mutual satisfaction... after long rejection and avoidance. The rain impregnated every land so it became... in childbirth, and some in labor. O boy, give me drink, for life has laughed... to us and smiled after contraction. And I see the pearls of bubbles competing with... the pearls of dew upon the flowers of gardens.' He also said: 'I entrust to Allah one who did not deviate from my sight... when a thought passed, while the buttocks attract him.'",

He also said: 'And a wondrous one whom the mind is unable to describe... due to the excessive bewilderment of eyes. He is like the thought whose meaning became fine... so it became roaming in ideas.' He also said: 'As if his eyelids were composed from the body of his lover... so they resemble him in illnesses. In his temple hair is a scorpion stinging the body... the antidote for its sting is in the saliva of his mouth.' He said about a Christian boy he loved: 'He tied his belt (Zunnar) on the slenderness of the waist... and tied hearts in the belt. And he let side-locks flow over a cheek...

Of his news and killing: When Talha and Al-Zubayr took control of Basra, and killed the guards of the treasury, who were seventy men without sin or cause, and took Uthman bin Hunayf al-Ansari, the governor of the Commander of the Faithful Ali bin Abi Talib, blessings of Allah be upon him, plucked his beard and wanted to kill him, Hakim stood among his people as a preacher and said to them: 'O people, Ibn Hunayf is preserved blood and a trust to be returned. By Allah, even if he were not an Emir over us, we would have defended him for the right of neighborhood and his place with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. How then when he has the right and authority? However, the living dies and the dead is questioned. So either you die as nobles or live as freemen.' They responded to what he called them to. Abu Umayya al-Asamm, who was the knight of the people, said regarding that: 'O assembly of Abdul Qays, die for that which... pleases Ali, and beware the shame of treachery. And do not fear in Allah the blame of a blamer... and die as nobles, for it is more honorable for memory.' Hakim went out in the morning with three hundred men of his companions to the enemy, which was Aisha. Talha and Al-Zubayr came out, and they carried Aisha on the camel. That day is called the Day of the Lesser Camel. Hakim fought a fierce battle, and began saying: 'You only want to obtain a share of the world. O Allah, kill them by whom they killed, and do not give them what they asked, and do not let them reach what they hoped, and do not forgive them ever.' He charged at them, while they were twelve thousand against his three hundred. He defeated them until he drove them into an alley. A man from Azd attacked Hakim while he was heedless and struck him on his leg, cutting off his foot. Hakim took his foot and struck the Azdi with it, knocking him down, then came and killed him, and began reciting: 'O soul do not fear... Indeed with me is my arm... even if my leg is cut.' He and three of his brothers were killed, and they expelled Rabi'ah from Basra and evacuated them from it. From the poetry of Yamut bin al-Mazra' about his son Muhalhil: 'Muhalhil, your youth preceded me... and your difficulty made my tears flow. At the borders of their Sham... I die so your trace is erased. If I were pardoned in my life... your danger would be great to them. O my sorrow for a lock of hair... to which your journey is long. And if I perish, then Allah... other than creation, is your shelter.' His poetry and the poetry of his son Muhalhil is abundant in all arts of poetry. We only mentioned what the book could bear and the condition required. \n\n**Dayr al-Bakht (Monastery of the Bactrian Camels)**\nThis monastery is in Damascus, two farsakhs from it. It is a large, beautiful monastery. It used to be called the Monastery of Michael (Dayr Mikha'il), then it was named with this name because of Bactrian camels belonging to Abdul Malik bin Marwan stationed there, so it became known by them. Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas had a small garden in that place, the size of four jaribs. He used to go out to it and picnic in it during the days of his stay in Damascus.",

    "text": "Ali bin Muhammad bin Abi Sayf al-Mada'ini mentioned, on the authority of his men, saying: Abdullah bin Abbas bought a yellow Berber slave girl in Medina. She gave birth to a boy in Abdullah's house, and he named him Salit. He grew up in his house and turned out robust and witty. Then he traveled with Ali bin Abdullah to Syria. He remained in his service until Abdul Malik died and his son Al-Walid took power. He showed prejudice against Ali bin Abdullah and criticized him in the presence of people. A group of Ali's enviers and people of oppression strove and corrupted Salit, adorning for him the claim of being Abdullah bin Abbas's son, saying: 'You resemble him in your beauty and appearance.' So Salit claimed he was the son of Abdullah bin Abbas and disputed with Ali before Al-Walid. Al-Walid ordered them to be raised to the judge of Damascus. Salit brought people who testified for him regarding his lineage, and that was reported to Al-Walid, so he attached him to Abdullah bin Abbas. He disputed with Ali over inheritance, and his conflict with him dragged on until Ali approached him and placed him in his household. He used to attend to Ali's needs and affairs. Ali went out one day to his garden at Dayr al-Bakht. He had people working there, among them Abu al-Dunn, from the descendants of Abu Rafi', the client of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. A quarrel broke out between them and Salit, so they jumped on him and killed him, after Ali bin Abdullah had left for Damascus. They dug a hole for him in the garden and buried him in it. Salit was missing from his mother, so she became suspicious. She went out looking for him and was informed that he entered the garden and did not come out. She came to Al-Walid's door screaming. He said: 'Whom do you accuse?' She said: 'Ali bin Abdullah.' He said: 'Bring me someone who testifies to his entering the garden with him.' She brought witnesses to that. Al-Walid sent to the garden to look if they could see anything or a trace. They dug up several spots but saw nothing. A tiller who was in the garden said to them: 'Run water over it so it becomes clear to you.' They ran water over it, and the spot collapsed. They dug it up and extracted Salit. Al-Walid sent for Ali, rebuked him, spoke harshly to him, and said: 'By Allah, if it is proven to me that you killed him, I will kill you for him!' He swore that he did not kill him nor ordered his killing. So Al-Walid imprisoned him. He wrote to the emirs of the cities and their jurists about his story, what he was accused of, and what was testified against him. Umar bin Abdul Aziz wrote to him from Medina: That he should be flogged, dressed in a wool cloak, and paraded. Al-Walid called for Ali bin Abdullah, flogged him sixty-one lashes—and it is said one hundred—then paraded him, stood him in the sun, dressed him in a hair cloak, and poured water on his head. That reached Abbad bin Ziyad, who was a friend of Ali bin Abdullah and favored by Al-Walid. He came, threw his clothes over Ali, entered upon Al-Walid, and spoke to him about him, saying: 'O Commander of the Faithful, is Ali accused of murder? Ali is more God-fearing and virtuous than to kill anyone!' Al-Walid ordered him to be sent to Dahlak. When he was taken out of Damascus, Sulayman bin Abdul Malik spoke about him and said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, return him and imprison him!' So he sent a messenger, and he was imprisoned where he was overtaken. He was overtaken at Al-Far'a, so he was imprisoned there in a village of it until Al-Walid died and Sulayman took power; he returned him. He settled in Al-Humayma in Al-Sharat of Al-Balqa, and sold his garden at Dayr al-Bakht to Fatima bint Abdul Malik. He said: Abdul Malik, at his death, advised Al-Walid regarding three people: He said to him: 'Ali bin Abdullah, regarding his lineage, kinship, and devotion to us: honor him and know his right. And your brother Abdullah: keep him over Egypt and do not remove him from it. And your uncle Muhammad bin Marwan: keep him over Al-Jazira and know his position.' The first thing he started with regarding his brother: He removed him from Egypt replacing him with Qurra bin Sharik. He removed his uncle from Al-Jazira. And he flogged Ali with the whip twice! When the Banu Abbas took power, they found in the treasuries of Banu Umayya a letter from Sulayman bin Abdul Malik to Al-Walid, asking him regarding Ali bin Abdullah and acknowledging his right. This letter was the reason for leaving Sulayman in his grave at Dabiq, and they did not exhume him as they exhumed his brothers and the Banu Harb.",

    "text": "Abu Muslim, the leader of their propaganda (Da'wa), claimed that he was from the descendants of Salit bin Abdullah bin Abbas! It was among the things Abu Ja'far [Al-Mansur] rebuked him with: 'And you claimed that you are the son of Salit son of Abdullah son of Abbas.' This was the first thing he began his address with, then informing him of his sins. 'So you wrote to Abu al-Abbas saying: Indeed Ibrahim the Imam acknowledged what Muhammad bin Ali entrusted to him regarding your lineage and Abdullah bin Abbas begetting you, and that you are Abdul Rahman bin Salit bin Abdullah bin Abbas, and that he promised you, if Allah completes this mission and kills the infidels of Banu Umayya, to marry you to Umm Ali daughter of Ali bin Abdullah. So what were you saying to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, while you are of unknown lineage: A lout from the louts of Isfahan.' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, your brother Ibrahim bin Muhammad told me this.' This dialogue occurred between them in a long address before he killed him. \n\n**Dayr Zakka (Monastery of Zakka)**\nThis monastery is in Raqqa on the Euphrates. On its sides is the Balikh river. It is among the best positioned monasteries and most pleasant in location. Kings, when passing by it, would stay in it and reside there, because it gathers everything they want of its construction, the value of its buildings, and the goodness of the places in it. Its exterior is a picnic spot, for it has wondrous remnants. In its vicinity are gazelles, hares, and similar things that are hunted with birds of prey, such as waterfowl, bustards, and types of birds. In the Euphrates, before it, are spots for casting nets for fish. So it gathers everything kings and commoners want. It is never devoid of pleasure-seekers due to its goodness, especially in the days of spring: for it has a wondrous view at that time. Al-Sanawbari has [poetry] in it: 'A southerly wind poured its buckets on the two Raqqas... noisy on both sides. And gave to the pavement a pavement of rain... visited repeatedly by the edge of the two forelocks. Monuments, rather remaining familiar places... in the most generous two institutes and two familiar places. It laughs with them at the Euphrates in every gap... so it laughs revealing gold or silver. As if the earth, of yellow and red [flowers]... is a bride displayed in two suits. As if the embrace of the two rivers of Dayr Zakka... when they embrace, is the embrace of two lovers. That Balikh protected the hand of the nights... and that Nile is of two neighbors. They stood like two bracelets, circling... on its sides or like two armlets. O picnicker in Dayr Zakka... was not my picnic with you two picnics? I repeat a glance between the rose of your dew... repeated between the rose of the two cheeks. And a smiling one like my arrangement of chamomile... revealed by the dew between two anemones. O ships of the Euphrates where you fall... the falling of birds between the two sides. Chasing each other coming and going... in haste, chasing two armies. You see us continuing with you as we promised... a connection we do not spoil with separation. O my two companions, take my rein... my passion, you are safe from two companions. The fifty [years] have usurped my youth... and stood between my pleasures and me. Amusement was to me like a brother... so we became after that for two causes.' From his beautiful poetry describing the two Raqqas: 'As for the gardens, their colors have appeared... their branches have crafted arts of their ornaments. Their meanings softened, and their breeze softened... and their beauties appeared and their time became good. They arranged necklaces of their flowers like jewels... arranging their emeralds to their gold. This is its lavender, and this its southernwood... this its anemones and this its ranunculus. If the pools of the clouds were connected... pouring, then its pools would be connected. The eye of every cloud weeps over it... its eyelids never tire of weeping. Led obediently by the south wind when it appears... as if its rein is in the hand of the south wind. Woe to the Southern Rafiqah, a locality... whose rivers and gardens were beautiful. O town whose worth continues to be great... in every quarter, and whose status is great. As for the Euphrates, it is its shallow water... as for the Hani, it is its garden. As if the days of youth are its days... and as if the times of love are its times. Whenever we hunt its gazelles one day... its gazelles continue to hunt our hearts. Urge the cups, for this is their time... Connect the gardens, for this is their season.' And he has: 'Time has become grim-faced... after we used to see it cheerful.'",

    "text": "'Days I drag the train of the days of youth... in the shade of a life that continues to be elegant. In the White Raqqa, when the oryx graze... my rights, and I do not observe rights for them. I go early to pleasures unobserved... by prevention, nor fearing obstruction. Among youths who removed their reins, so they... do not hesitate in the paths of righteousness to exit. I contended with them for its cup, as if its breeze... is musk diffused in the vessel, open. It tore the mask of night when... the hand of the boon companion left its mask torn. It dyed the blackness of its darkness with the redness of its color... so it was as if it was obsidian returned as carnelian. And I say to my two companions: Do pray... for me with the morning draught on the Euphrates a night drink. Indeed the Euphrates is the nectar, and you... are only exchanging nectar upon nectar.' And he has: 'The rose has surrounded the anemone... amidst your elegant garden. As if around it are faces... overlooking a fire. So drink upon this anemone a cup... you drink carnelian upon carnelian.' He also said: 'A groan of longing, and for the lover is a moan... when the eyelids overflowed upon the cheeks. Ah from a sigh created by longing... and a disease buried between the ribs. How can the aggrieved take comfort, or how can the lover forget... or how can the sad one be distracted? Do not blame me for the two Raqqas and leave me... for my heart is held hostage by the two Raqqas. O my boon companion, do you not yearn for revelry... for this is a time when yearning appears. Do you not see the side of the prayer-ground, and... its hills and bellies have shone from it. Chamomile, lily, and anemone... and spring flowers to be picked and calendula. Saddles of rain were saddled in its gardens... and its plains and rugged grounds became pleasant. Indeed March did not leave under the belly... of the earth anything that January had hidden. And the wondrous narcissus appeared like... eyes gazing at eyes. Do you not see the side of Al-Hani, and... the gilliflower and eglantine have shone in it. The nightingale shouted in it, the dove wailed in it... the turtle dove sang in its atmosphere. For this is its southernwood and its lavender... and this is the rose in it and the jasmine. And as if the Euphrates between them is a spring... of silver in which ships swim. Like the bellies of snakes or like the backs of Mashrafi... swords purified by smiths. No year has come to people like this year... no, nor has come the like of this time. A time of a land shining with flowers... and a cloud abundant in downpour, pouring. Waters meet: water from the cloud... and water flowing and spring water. How many a sound heart went towards Dayr Zakka... and returned while it was sad. If you stopped by the Monastery one day, arts would distract you... and arts would delight you. My blamer regarding my passion, enough, slowly... do not blame me, for blame is madness. How many a gazelle in whose palm the rose is offered... and in his cheek is a preserved rose. So if I move my glance in his cheeks... thoughts roam in my heart. No one is happy who is not aided by... a happy grandfather and an auspicious bird. And a tongue like the sword and a heart... true in determination and a firm opinion.' He also said: 'Who is the judge between Time and me... It did not cease until it tamed me with separation. As for my two quarters that became desolate... I did not marvel after them at two quarters. Why did I distance myself from Al-Hani, and I was... unable to distance from it the blink of an eye. O Dayr Zakka, you were the best familiar place... Time bestowed with it upon two friends. And by my soul, the meadow whose sides... smiled at us revealing gold and silver.'",

    "text": "'If the two weights (Jinn and Mankind) were burdened with what I was burdened of... longing, it would be heavy for the two weights to carry.' He also said: 'And to the two Raqqas I fold the villages of the desert... with a submissive mount folded by the back. Hail to Karkh, hail to Al-Umr, no rather... hail to the Monastery, hail to the two Cypresses. Spring has manifested in robes of flowers... and the doves fashioned the jewelry of songs. The hand of spring clothed them with colors... a cloak like the Yemeni Athami. O my two friends, give me, cure me... give me the dark wine, do not ward me off. Remove the water, remove the water, rise... bring near, bring near the daughters of the jars. Give me drink of every color of wine... upon all these colors. Green color like emerald in red... clear of skin like purple. And chamomile like moist pearls... separated between carnelian with coral. And spring flowers like dinars surrounded... by the flower of gilliflower and ranunculus. As if Al-Nu'man untied upon them... robes of the anemones of Al-Nu'man.' Al-Rashid has [poetry] mentioning this monastery: 'Peace upon the displaced stranger... the greeting of a lover depressed by it. A gazelle whose pastures are at Balikh... to Dayr Zakka, then Qasr al-Khashab. O you who aided against himself... by leaving behind, willingly, the one he loved. I will conceal, and concealment is of my nature... the love of the one I love from the one I do not love.' Upon his journey from Al-Rafiqah to Baghdad, he left behind Maridah, the mother of Abu Ishaq Al-Mu'tasim. He missed her, so he wrote to her with these verses. He said: When Al-Rashid's letter reached her, she said to someone who composes poetry: 'Answer him!' So he said on her behalf: 'Your letter came to me, O my master... and in it, along with grace, is every wonder. Do you claim that you are a lover of me... and that you are madly in love and ardent for me? If this were so, you would not have... left me as an opportunity for grief. While you are in Baghdad grazing in it... the gardens of pleasure with whom you love. O you who shunned me while I did not shun him... and O you who saddened me with what is in the books. Your letter has increased me in passion... and ignited the fire of flame in my heart. So grant that yes, I concealed the love... so how with concealing a flowing tear? And were it not for fearing you, O my master... the salvation she-camels would have brought me to you.' He said: When he read her letter, he immediately sent someone to bring her down to him. Salih al-Turki mentioned, and Al-Mu'tasim was in his care, saying: Al-Rashid loved Maridah with an excruciating love, so he said about her: 'And if you look at her beauties... then for every place is a look of an arrow. And she attains from you with the edge of her glance... what the blade does not attain with its edge. She distracted you, and she is a distraction for everyone with sight... who met the beauties of her face. Her heart has a clemency that distances her... from the lover, and her glance has ignorance. And for her face from her face is a moon... and for her eye from her eye is kohl.' Al-Rashid has good poetry, and single verses, which used to be quoted. Most of his poetry is about his slave girls and his love for them. From his poetry: 'She owned the one who became an owner to me... but she is unjust in her ownership. If I wished, power would drive her to me... but the rule of love is binding upon me. I loved [her] from among this mankind... while she is knowledgeable news of my love. Ugly is the action of one whose face is beautiful... the blamer is excused in the likes of him. The most beautiful of what a seer saw... if only he were merciful in his beauty.' And he has: 'Love has turned me to what you see... it wasted my body and seared my heart. Love has written on my forehead... This is a slain one in the path of passion.' He said: Al-Rashid had favored Haylanah, the slave girl of his brother Al-Hadi. He loved her intensely. He left her in Baghdad during some of his travels, then missed her, so he said these verses: 'The beloved sent his peace with the south wind... so return peace to him with the north wind. And know with your heart what his heart contained... and circulate the days with your love. Whenever you weep for him, be certain that... his eyes will overflow with pouring tears. So hold your tears out of mercy for his tears... if you preserve or guard a covenant.'",

    "text": "From his poetry about his three slave girls: 'I distributed my love willingly... between Shajw, and Diya, and Khunath. They contend for love from a lover... secure in a knot that does not unravel. And if Shajw comes visiting... she removes from me the grief of every sorrow.' He said: Al-Rashid was born in Rayy, at the beginning of the year one hundred forty-eight. Al-Fadl bin Yahya was born seven days before him, so Umm al-Fadl suckled him. Allegiance was pledged to him for the Caliphate on Saturday night, with fourteen nights remaining of the month of Rabi' al-Awwal, year one hundred seventy. In this night, Abdullah al-Ma'mun was born from a slave girl named Marajil. So in this night a Caliph died, a Caliph took charge, and a Caliph was born. This is one of the curious coincidences. Al-Rashid died in a village called Sanabadh, of the district of Tus. He was forty-five years old, on Saturday, four days passed of Jumada al-Akhira, year one hundred ninety-three. His caliphate was twenty-three years and a month and a half. \n\n**Dayr Masarjis (Monastery of St. Sergius)**\nThis monastery is in Ana. Ana is a populated city on the Euphrates, and this monastery is in it. It is large, beautiful, with many monks. People visit it from Hit and elsewhere to picnic in it. There are vineyards, presses, orchards, and trees there. The place is of ultimate beauty, gathering what the people of music and recreation need. Ibn Abi Talib al-Makfuf al-Wasiti has [poetry] in it: 'Many a reddish wine from the daughters of the Magians... Babylonian, ancient wine. I sipped it with a flute and oud... before the deacon struck the bell (Naqus). And a kohl-eyed gazelle of coquetry... with enchanting glance, Samaritan, a bride. His religion is announced as the religion of the Christians... but when he is alone, it is the religion of the Magians. We secluded with a gazelle looking at him... a Saturday to the morning of Thursday. Between roses, narcissus, and spring flowers... in the middle of the garden of Dayr Masarjis. Bending with the beautiful neck of a gazelle... possessing a silvered ebony cross. How many times did I kiss the cross on his neck... like a crescent crowned with suns.' In this place is the grave of the mother of Al-Fadl bin Yahya bin Khalid bin Barmak. When Al-Rashid traveled from Raqqa to Baghdad intending Hajj, the Barmakids traveled with him, and Umm al-Fadl died. She had suckled Al-Rashid with Al-Fadl's milk. He used to love and revere her. Al-Fadl's birth was seven days before Al-Rashid's birth. So Al-Rashid ordered, and ten jaribs of an orchard at Wadi al-Qanatir on the bank of the Euphrates were bought for her, and she was buried there and a dome was built over her. It is known as the Barmakid Dome. \n\n**Dayr Ibn Maz'uq**\nThis monastery is in Al-Hirah, in its center, near Dayr al-Hariq. It is a monastery with many monks, beautiful architecture, one of the intended parks and described places. Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman al-Tharwani has [poetry] in it: 'I said to him while the stars were rising... on the night of Easter at the beginning of dawn: Do you have a desire for Mar Fathion and... the monastery of Ibn Maz'uq, unshortened? This breeze overflows from the direction... of Sham, and the pearls of dew are on the trees. And we ask the earth about its vegetation... and its covenant with spring and rain. O what goodness and smelling of a scent... like musk coming with the breath of dawn. In drinking wine and listening to a proficient woman... distracting you between the tongue and the string.' This Al-Tharwani was a Kufan, naturally gifted in poetry, engrossed in idle pursuits, throwing himself into taverns, addicted to drinking wine, and excessive in following beardless boys. He knew nothing other than that. He was not found in any worldly matter except in it. His end was that he was found in a vintner's tavern between two wineskins, dead! From his beautiful poetry is his saying: 'Al-Mihrajan has come to you upon entering... escorted by musical instruments and singing girls. And the pure wine was carried towards you... the jars travel with it and carry it. For this day there is a clear merit... over the days, known and having status. If you revere it, you have honored Khosrow... and the noble Hormuzan has honored you. And Bahram Gur has purified love for you... and Al-Fayruzan hastened in your satisfaction. For the glorification of what they glorified... and their ancestors professed it and they professed. So leave dispute, and \"No\" and \"Until\"... and \"I will come to you\" and \"Yes\" and \"Now\". Your dispute is not permissible against the drinking companions... and Al-Mihrajan is not pleased with that.' He also said:",

You make me doubt, yet I know that this... is love between affection and rejection. Your love is a love renewed by the nights... and does not wear out with the passing of epochs.' From his poetry also: 'Repeat the drink to an intoxicated morning drinker... who woke up to drink it while the rooster had not crowed. And the night is in an army with many lightnings... of stars, and the light of dawn had not cleared. And life is no life unless you approach it early... a reddish wine that kills the soul's worry with joy. Until the one who drank it since he spent the night remains... with no liveliness in him, strutting like liveliness.' \n\n**Dayr Sargis (Monastery of Sargis)**\nThis monastery was at Tiznabadh, which is between Kufa and Qadisiyah, on the edge of the road; between it and Qadisiyah is a mile. Its land was surrounded by palm trees, vineyards, trees, taverns, and presses. It was one of the intended spots and described parks. It is now ruined and void, its traces effaced and its wells demolished. Nothing remains of all its traces except ruined domes and a stone on the main road, which people call the Press of Abu Nuwas. Abu Nuwas has [poetry] in it: 'They said: You will become pious after the Hajj! I said to them: ... I hope for God and fear Tiznabadh. I fear a vine branch disputing with me... the head of the halter even if I hastened the pace. For if I am safe—and my soul is not confident... of safety—I will not be safe in Baghdad. How far is guidance from a heart contained by... Qatrabbul, then the villages of Banna, then Kalwadh.' This monastery was among the best constructed monasteries and most pleasant in location. Al-Husayn bin al-Dahhak has [poetry] in it: 'My two brothers, come to the morning drink in the morning... wake up and do not bypass the boon companion going. As long as a helper stays for the morning drink... and for the evening drink, I will not want departure. Return to our habit of yesterday morning... for return is more praiseworthy as a start and a return. Do you excuse a companion at Dayr Sargis... for sobriety, or do you see that as a sin? I seek refuge for you by a familiarity between us... that you drink pure water in the villages of the Euphrates. Our jugs roared and our priest hallowed... chanting, and we made the chickens clamor with shouting. For the Jashariya is its merit, so hasten... if you see that as right. O Lord, one with heavy eyelids from sleep... I alerted him with wine when he rested. As if the aroma of the cup when I called him... to the cup raised a wing in his gut. So he answered stumbling in the folds of his robe... hasty, mixing stumbling with liveliness. So I tore the veil of his licentiousness with my licentiousness... in every distraction, and I revealed and he revealed. He kept laughing at me and making me laugh at him... he does not wake up from jesting and joking.' \n\n**Dayyarat al-Asaqif (Monasteries of the Bishops)**\nThese monasteries are in Najaf, outside Kufa, which is the beginning of Al-Hirah. They are domes and palaces called the Monasteries of the Bishops. In their presence is a river known as Al-Ghadir. To its right is the Palace of Abu al-Khasib, client of Abu Ja'far, and to its left is Al-Sadir, and between that are the monasteries. This palace of Abu al-Khasib is one of the parks of the world. It overlooks Najaf and that ridge. One ascends from its bottom on a staircase fifty steps long to a beautiful roof and sitting place, so the viewer overlooks Najaf and Al-Hirah from that spot. Then one ascends from it on another staircase fifty steps long to a spacious roof and wondrous sitting place. This Abu al-Khasib is the client of Abu Ja'far al-Mansur and his doorkeeper. Al-Sadir is a great palace from the buildings of the kings of Lakhm in ancient times. What remains of it now are monasteries and churches for Christians. Ali bin Muhammad al-Himmani al-Alawi mentions these places: 'How many a stop you had at Al-Khawarnaq... not equaled by stops. Between Al-Ghadir to Al-Sadir... to the Monasteries of the Bishops. The paths of the monks in... worn clothes, fearful female and male. Ruins whose gardens seem... to be clothed in marked robes. And as if their pools... contain tithes in Qurans. And as if their flowers... shake with the stormy winds. The forelocks of servant girls meet... in them with the forelocks of servant girls. You meet their beginnings... and their ends with colors of ornaments. Marine in their winters... desert-like in which are summer resorts.'",

    "text": "'Pearl-pebbled, camphor-like... are the high lookouts in it. Then she burst pouring like... a weeping woman with four flowing [tears].' Abu Nuwas mentions his days at Al-Sadir: 'Days of revelry returned to me at the Monastery... and joy with boon companions and music. And the eyes of gazelles gazing at us... blessed with every kindness and gentleness. And soft of steps, almost from... delicacy making every limb bleed blood. The cross settled from him in the place of the neck... indeed it specialized him over every intimate. We turned the mill of bliss three times... and connected bliss palm to palm.' He said: When Al-Rashid stayed at Al-Hirah, at the time of his return from Hajj, Ja'far bin Yahya rode to Al-Sadir, toured it, and looked at its construction. Then his eye fell on writing at its top, so he ordered someone to climb to the spot and read it. He said to himself: 'I have made it an omen for what I fear from Al-Rashid.' It was read, and behold it was: 'Indeed the Banu al-Mundhir passed away in a year... where the monk built the church. They became such that no hoper hopes for them... one day, nor does a monk fear them. They became food for the worms of the earth... and the sought and the seeker were cut off.' So Ja'far grieved at that and began reciting the verses and saying: 'By Allah, our matter is gone!' Among these buildings: Al-Masqatat. It is a palace with long roofed corridors east of Al-Hirah on the pilgrim road. Then Al-Qasr. Then Kuwat al-Baqqal. Then the Palace of the Adasis. Then Al-Aqsa al-Abyad. Then the Palace of Banu Buqayla. This palace belonged to Abdul Masih bin Buqayla al-Ghassani. He was named Buqayla (Little Sprout) only because he came out one day to his people in two green suits, having wrapped one as a waistcloth and cloaked himself with the other. His people said: 'He is nothing but a Buqayla.' So he was named that. This Abdul Masih is the nephew of Satih the Soothsayer. Khosrow had sent him to Satih because of the vision he saw. He came to him while he was dying, and said: 'Is the Noble of Yemen deaf or does he hear?' in verses. Satih opened his eye and said: 'Abdul Masih, on a striving camel, came to Satih, while he is on the brink of the grave, from the King of Banu Sasan, due to the shaking of the Iwan, the extinguishing of the fires, and the vision of the Mobadhan.' The news is famous; we left it for its fame. When Khalid bin al-Walid camped at Al-Hirah, Abdul Masih came out to him. Khalid said to him: 'From where is your furthest trace?' He said: 'From my father's loins!' He said: 'I did not ask you about this!' He said: 'And I did not answer except what you asked about!' He said: 'What are you?' He said: 'Arabs who became Nabateans!' He said: 'So what is the matter of these fortresses?' He said: 'We built them to protect ourselves in them from the ignorant until the wise comes and deters him!' He said: 'Do you understand?' He said: 'Yes, and I lead!' He said: 'What is your age?' He said: 'Bone!' He said: 'How much has come upon you?' He said: 'If anything came upon me it would kill me!' He said: 'How much of your life has passed?' He said: 'Four hundred years!' He said: 'So what wonders have you seen?' He said: 'I saw ships docking in this place, and I saw a woman going out from Al-Hirah to Sham with her spindle in her hand and her basket on her head, no one frightening her. And it is now a ruin and wasteland; and that is Allah's habit with His creation.' In his hand was something he was turning over. Khalid said: 'What is this in your hand?' He said: 'Instant poison!' He said: 'What will you do with it?' He said: 'If you give me what I like, [good]; otherwise, I will kill myself with it. I will not be the first to bring humiliation upon his people and drive to them what they hate.' Khalid said: 'Give it to me.' He handed it to him. He threw it in his mouth, said: 'In the name of Allah,' and swallowed it. A swoon overtook him, then he recovered, as if he was released from a shackle. Abdul Masih returned to his people and said: 'I came to you from a man who drank instant poison and it did not harm him.' He carried money to him, made a peace treaty with him, and left them. After it: Dar Awn, then Qubbat Asr Kadha, which is what is next to Najaf. These are the palaces of Al-Hirah remaining now. \n\n**Qubbat al-Shattiq (Dome of al-Shattiq)**\nIt is among the ancient buildings in Al-Hirah, on the pilgrim road. Opposite it are domes called Al-Shakurrah; all of them belong to the Christians. They go out on their feast day from Al-Shakurrah to the Dome, in the best attire, wearing crosses, with censers in their hands. The deacons and priests are with them, chanting holiness in one tune, agreed in melodies. A large crowd of Muslim pleasure-seekers and idle people follow them until they reach Qubbat al-Shattiq. They offer sacrifices and baptize, then return in the same manner. It is a beautiful sight. A poet said about it: 'And the virgins tightening the belts... upon them every firm ornament. Walking from the domes of Sha'anin... to the courtyard of Qubbat al-Shattiq. O my friend, do not blame me on a day... you see play in it in reality.' And for Bakr bin Kharija:",

    "text": "'O my two friends, turn with me to Al-Hirah... how long, how long will you watch the stars? And give me drink from the house of Sijum... wine, a coffee-colored wine, do not bargain with Sijum. A tavern whose filling is beautiful gazelles... they agitated a sick heart with coquetry. And when you give me drink... old sealed wine. Then head for Qubbat al-Shattiq and a gazelle... inhabiting the monastery, who captivated me, soft-voiced. The knot of his belt connected to the heart... so it became pierced within the vitals.' This Bakr bin Kharija was from the people of Kufa. He was among those engrossed in wine, infatuated with throwing himself into taverns and monasteries. Most of his poetry was about that. From his poetry also: 'He went from the tavern drunk... so he increased my worry and sorrows. The tavern of Sijum which made... from her love fires in the heart. A wide-eyed fawn gazes with two eyes... you think him drowsy from drunkenness. The two eyes never saw a likeness to him... among humans if counted nor Jinn. The knots of the belt on his waist... tortured me with love in varieties. I concealed my love and passion for him... for an age, and conditions, and times. Until my body turned to decay... so I cannot bear concealment today.' \n\n**Dayr Hind bint al-Nu'man bin al-Mundhir (Monastery of Hind daughter of al-Nu'man)**\nHind built this monastery in Al-Hirah, became a nun in it, and dwelt in it for a long time, then went blind. This monastery is one of the greatest and most populated monasteries of Al-Hirah. It is between the Trench (Khandaq) and Hisn Bani Bakr. When Al-Hajjaj came to Kufa in the year seventy-four, it was said to him that between Al-Hirah and Kufa is a monastery belonging to Hind bint al-Nu'man, and she is in it, and possesses opinion and intellect. So look at her for she is a remnant. He rode with the people until he came to the monastery. She was told: 'This is the Emir Al-Hajjaj at the door.' She looked out from a side of the monastery. He said to her: 'O Hind, how wonderful is what I saw!' She said: 'The going out of the likes of me to the likes of you! Do not be deceived, O Hajjaj, by the world, for we became morning while we were as Al-Nabigha said: \"I saw you as one for whom the rope of protection is tied... by people; his herds are safe where he pastures.\" And we did not reach evening except that we are the lowliest of people. Rarely does a vessel fill except it overturns.' Al-Hajjaj left angry, and sent someone to evict her from the monastery and demand the land tax from her. She was brought out with three of her maidservants. One of them said upon her exit: 'Exiting ones driven from the Monastery of Hind... submissive in humiliation and disgrace. I wish I knew, is this the beginning of the Gathering [Judgment Day]... or has Time wiped out the jealousy of young men?' A youth from the people of Kufa charged on his horse, rescued them from Al-Hajjaj's police, and went into hiding. Her poetry and the youth's action reached Al-Hajjaj. He said: 'If he comes to us, he is safe; and if we catch him, we will kill him!' The youth came to him. He said to him: 'What induced you to do what you did?' He said: 'Jealousy!' So he gave him a gift and released him. Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas, when he conquered Iraq, came to Hind at her monastery. She came out to him, so he honored her and offered her himself for her needs. She said: 'I will greet you with a greeting our kings used to be greeted with: May a hand that attained poverty after wealth not touch you, nor may a hand that attained wealth after poverty touch you. May Allah not make you have a need from a miser. And may Allah not strip a blessing from a generous one except He makes you a cause for returning it to him.' Then Al-Mughira came to her, when Muawiyah appointed him governor of Kufa. He asked permission to enter upon her. She was told: 'The Emir of this town is at the door.' She said: 'Say to him: Are you from the children of Jabala bin al-Ayham?' He said: 'No!' She said: 'Then from the children of Al-Mundhir bin Ma' al-Sama'?' He said: 'No!' She said: 'Then who are you?' He said: 'Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba al-Thaqafi.' She said: 'So what is your need?' He said: 'I came to you as a suitor!' She said: 'If you came to me for beauty or status, I would have answered you. But you wanted to honor yourself by me in the gatherings of the Arabs, saying: \"I married the daughter of Al-Nu'man bin al-Mundhir!\" Otherwise, what pride is there in the meeting of a one-eyed man and a blind woman?' Then he sent to her, saying: 'How was your affair?' She said: 'I will shorten the answer for you. We reached evening one evening and there was no Arab on earth but he desired us and feared us; then we reached morning and there was no one but we desire him and fear him!' He said: 'So what did your father say about Thaqif?' She said: 'Two men of them disputed before him regarding something; one traced his lineage to Iyad and the other to Bakr bin Hawazin. He judged in favor of the Iyadi, and said: \"Indeed Thaqif was not Hawazin... and did not relate to Amir and Mazin.\"' Al-Mughira said: 'As for us, we are from Bakr bin Hawazin, so let your father say what he wishes!' \n\n**Dayr Zurara (Monastery of Zurara)**",

    "text": "It is a beautiful monastery, between the Bridge of Kufa and Hammam A'yan, away from the road on the right of one leaving Baghdad for Kufa. It is a pleasant picnic spot, with many taverns and drink, populated by those who visit it, never devoid of those seeking play and preferring idleness. It is one of the locations suited for that. He said: Yahya bin Ziyad and Muti' bin Iyas went out for Hajj. When they neared Dayr Zurara, one said to the other: 'Would you like to send our baggage ahead and go to Zurara, drink in its monastery for our night, and provision ourselves from its beardless boys and wine enough for the return, then catch up with our baggage?' They did so. The people marched on, and they stayed. That remained their habit until the pilgrims returned. When they arrived at Kufa, they shaved their heads, rode two camels, and entered with the pilgrims. Muti' said: 'Did you not see me and Yahya when we performed Hajj... And Hajj was of the best trade. We went out seeking Hajj and religion... but the road turned us to Zurara. So the people returned having gained and performed Hajj... and we returned burdened with loss.' Then he also said about it, and it has a melody. It is said the verses belong to Abu Ali al-Basir: 'We went out seeking Mecca... as pilgrims and visitors. When the camel driver reached Al-Hirah... my camel became confused. And the star almost set... for the morning or had set. So I said: Put down my saddle here... and do not care about who marched. So we renewed covenants... that had passed from us and traces. And we fulfilled needs of ours... that were, and desires. And we accompanied in it a monastery... and a priest and a vintner. And a gazelle tying between... the dune [hips] and the waist a belt. We explained news to you... and we integrated news.' Abu Nuwas has [poetry] in this meaning: 'And a sayer: Do you want Hajj? I said to him: ... Yes, when the pleasures of Baghdad are exhausted. By Qatrabbul from it where we see... then the Dome of Al-Fark from the sides of Kalwadh. Then Al-Salihiyya, then Al-Karkh where... the deviants of Baghdad gathered for me with deviants. And how is Hajj for me as long as I am immersed... in the house of a procuress or the house of a winemaker. And granting that you save me from the revelry of Baghdad... how is the escape for me from Tiznabadh?' Among those who did the act of Muti' was Sulayman bin Muhammad al-Umawi. He had prepared the Bactrian camels for Hajj and attended to them all year. When he reached Kufa, he changed his mind and stayed, saying: 'My greed for Hajj spoiled the intellect... since I found no escape nor refuge. I repented to Him from sins and from... an innocent honor satirized with abomination. So He returned me disappointed to my cup... and saying poetry, while His pardon is hoped. Where the wineskins become submissive... you think them from their blackness Zanj. When we placed a vat for the skin... and untied its bond, it spilled. My provision for Hajj became a snack... when I sipped the slippery wine. And my sleeping place became my wineskin, I enjoyed it... full, never leaving the saddlebag. Thus is he who seeks reward but... does not rise except with a lame intention.' Abu al-Madrahi, Salam bin Ghalib bin Shammas, and Abu al-Basir the poet went out wanting Hajj. When they reached Kufa, Abu al-Basir and Salam changed their minds, then Abu al-Madrahi continued. Abu al-Basir said addressing Salam: 'Take the head of the sandgrouse and seek... Allah's choice towards the house of the singing girl of Al-Rammah. Where musical instruments and wine are not denied... and the placing of hands on vulvas.' Muti' bin Iyas was among the wittiest of people, best in poetry, most abundant in jokes, and most intense in licentiousness and debauchery. He did not cease drinking and playing, engrossed in loss, and throwing himself into places of pleasure. Muti', Yahya bin Ziyad, Hammad Ajrad, and Hammad al-Rawiya never separated. All of them were on one path in licentiousness, and all of them were accused of Zandaqa (heresy)! Al-Utbi mentioned from his father, saying: An old man from the people of Kufa came to us; I never saw one better in speech than him. He used to tell me about Muti', the two Hammads, and the wits of the people of Kufa and their wonders. He did not tell about any of them better than what he told me about Muti' bin Iyas. I said to him: 'By Allah, I desired to see Muti'.' He said: 'By Allah, if you saw him, you would have met a great affliction from him!' I said: 'How?' He said: 'You would see a man whom a wise person cannot bear to be without if he sees him, and no one accompanies him but gets exposed by him!'",

    "text": "Ibn Habib mentioned, saying: I saw a man from the people of Kufa, so I asked him about Muti', as he had accompanied him. He said: 'You do not want to ask about him.' I said: 'Why is that?' He said: 'What is your question about a man who, if he attends you, he owns you; if he is absent from you, you miss him; and if you are known for his company, he exposes you!' Muti' was among the veterans of the two dynasties, the Umayyad and the Abbasid. He praised Al-Walid bin Yazid, drank with him, praised his brother, and was favored by him. He said: Muti' bin Iyas, Shura'a bin al-Zandabudh, Yahya bin Ziyad, Waliba bin al-Hubab, Abdullah bin Ayyash al-Mantuf, and Hammad Ajrad attended the gathering of an Emir in Kufa. They all gathered against Muti', plotted against him, and satirized him. He overcame them all, then improvised against them, saying: 'And five who have shown me their enmity... and a frying pan and pot have burned for them. If they could, my flesh would be divided by... a monkey, a dog, its two puppies, and a pig.' So he silenced them, and they acknowledged him. He said: They gathered drinking and remained like that for days. Yahya bin Ziyad said to them one night, while they were drunk: 'Woe to you! We haven't prayed for three days. Stand with us so we may pray.' They said: 'Yes!' Muti' stood up, called the Adhan and Iqama. Then he said to the singing girl: 'Step forward and lead us in prayer.' She stepped forward; she was without trousers, wearing a thin tunic. When she prostrated, her private parts were exposed. Muti' jumped to it and kissed it, then said: 'And when her thing appeared crouching... like a shaven head and she did not lean. I prostrated to it then kissed it... as the diligent worshiper does.' So they cut their prayer with laughter, then returned to what they were doing. He said: Yahya bin Ziyad wrote one day to Muti': 'I am energetic for drinking. If you are free, come to me. And if you have good date wine and singing, I will come to you!' The note came to him while Hammad al-Rawiya, Hakam al-Wadi, and a beardless boy were with him. He answered him: 'Yes, we have date wine... and we have Hammad. And we have our Wadi... and he is no pillar ('Imad). And our good is plentiful... and good is sought for increase. And our amusement is delicious... worshippers have not distracted it. Or do you desire mounting... then we have corruption. Or do you desire a boy... then our Nad (friend) is Ziyad. He has no twisting... away from us nor distance.' When he read the note, he went to them, and they completed the rest of their day. Yahya bin Ziyad said to him: 'Go with us to So-and-so the singer'—he loved her—'for there is anger between us. Perhaps you can reconcile between me and her, though you are a wretched reconciler, by Allah!' They entered upon her. Yahya began reproaching her, and Muti' was silent. He said to him: 'What silences you? May Allah silence your breath?' Muti' said: 'You are acting coy with him while he has... ceased not to debase himself in your love.' Yahya liked what he said, beamed at him, and said: 'Go on!' He said: 'So leave him, and connect with Ibn Iyas... I have made his soul this morning your ransom.' Yahya stood up to him with a cushion to beat his head with it, and said: 'Is it for this I invited you, O son of a whore?'",

    "text": "He said: In Kufa, there was a man named Abu al-Asbagh. He had a son named Asbagh, considered the handsomest among people. Mutai’ ibn Iyas, Yahya ibn Ziyad, and Hammad Ajrad would sneak into his house and were infatuated with his son but could not approach him. Abu al-Asbagh decided to have breakfast one day with Yahya ibn Ziyad, so he sent him gifts during the night: a kid, chickens, fruits, and drinks. Abu al-Asbagh told his servants: 'Yahya ibn Ziyad is with us, prepare everything he desires.' After the meal, there was no messenger to deliver his gifts except his son Asbagh. He said to him: 'Do not leave unless Yahya is with you.' When Asbagh arrived, he told the servant: 'Let him in, you stand aside and close the door. If Asbagh tries to leave, stop him.' When Asbagh entered and delivered the message, Yahya tried to seduce him, but he resisted. Yahya struggled and tried to force him, but could not, and finally cut off his attempt. Afterward, he gave him forty dinars which were under his prayer mat. Asbagh accepted them. Yahya said: 'Go, I am following you.' Asbagh left, and Yahya washed, adorned himself, and perfumed. Mutai’ entered, saw him, and asked: 'How are you this morning?' Yahya ignored him, lifted his nose, and frowned. Mutai’ asked: 'Where are you going?' Yahya did not reply. Mutai’ said: 'What is wrong? Did revelation descend on you? Did angels speak to you? Were you pledged to caliphate?' Yahya gestured: 'No, no!' Mutai’ said: 'You are perplexing us by not speaking, as if Asbagh son of Abu al-Asbagh has pierced you.' Yahya said: 'Indeed! Just now, I gave him forty dinars.' Mutai’ asked: 'Where are you going?' He said: 'To my father’s invitation.' Mutai’ asked: 'What about your wife if you leave? Will she come to you?' Yahya revealed her to him, and he accepted. Mutai’ asked how he managed it. Yahya explained, then prepared to go to Abu al-Asbagh’s house. Mutai’ followed, waited an hour, then knocked and sought permission. The messenger said: 'He is busy today and cannot see you.' Mutai’ sent a note with ink and paper, writing: 'O Abu al-Asbagh, you remain high and distant … do not make me like those … who are cut off, achieving what they desire without end … or neglecting rightful duty … If you saw Asbagh humble beneath … embarrassed, submissive, receiving punishment … you would call him and see a shameful matter.' Abu al-Asbagh asked Yahya: 'Did you do it, son of the woman?' He said: 'No!' He struck his son’s pedestal and found it cut, confirming the scandal. Yahya said: 'What happened has happened. Mutai’ son of the woman approached you. This is my son, more worthy than yours. I am Arab, son of an Arab woman, your son is Nabati, son of a Nabati woman. Take my son ten times for the act against your son, gaining the dinars, eleven in total.' Abu al-Asbagh laughed and gave the dinars to his son, who received them shamefacedly. Yahya said: 'Mutai’ son of the woman has no share!' Abu al-Asbagh and his servants said: 'Let him enter; we are exposed!' He entered, sat with them, drank, while Yahya cursed him, and Mutai’ laughed. Mutai’ had many witty stories, which were not included to avoid length and boredom. He wrote beautiful poetry and sang. Among them: 'Alas for the gazelle whose pursuit I longed for … until its will bent to me, softening … enticing me … until I said I have it and it left.' Also: 'My beloved Khalili is always distant … he promises tomorrow and the day after … and it never ends.' Another: 'Remove your modesty in love … and drink aged wine, join the singing girls openly … for life in their company distracts you only from what you desire, though life is fleeting.' Mutai’ disliked and satirized his father. He was from Banu Kinana. Once, he mentioned the tribes of Quraysh and Arabs, describing each. Someone asked: 'Where is Banu Kinana?' He replied without pause: 'In Palestine, they ride swiftly,' alluding to the poet: 'Circle around me, Banu Kinana … in Palestine they ride swiftly.'",

    "text": "**'Umr al-Anbar (The Monastery of Anbar)**\n\nThis monastery is in Al-Anbar, on the Euphrates. It is a large, beautiful monastery with many cells and monks. It has a strongly built wall, serving as a fortress for it. The congregate mosque is adjacent to it. It is never devoid of picnickers and those affecting wit. It has a beautiful exterior and a wondrous view, especially in the days of spring, because its deserts and all its lands become like robes due to the abundance of rare flowers and artistic blossoms. Whoever among the Caliphs and those below them passes by Al-Anbar stays there for the duration of his residence. Poets have described it and mentioned it in their poems.\n\nAl-Husayn bin al-Dahhak said about it:\n'The bell announced the dawn to you... and the monk chanted in the monastery.\nYour eyes wandered in a garden... laughing with red and yellow [flowers].\nAnd a drunkard yearned for his wine... and the cup came according to measure.\nSo turn away from sleep to drinking it... as you would turn away from death to resurrection.'\n\nAnd Kushajim said about it:\n'Go early, my friend, to Al-Anbar... drink wine in the prime of the day.\nPopulate the monastery with pleasure and revelry... urging the cups and the strings.\nDo you not see that Time has come to you with a face... cheerful after frowning and turning away?\nWearing a suit of flowers that was... before hidden from eyes.\nNarcissus like eyes watching the one it loves... without a watcher or caution.\nAnd when the anemones appear in it... the onlookers think it a flame of fire.\nOr as if red robes were spread... for a prince in a massive army.\nAs if the fresh violet in it... is the trace of a pinch on the cheeks of maidens.\nAnd the sky-colored lavender appeared in it... like rubies arranged in winnowing forks.\nAnd as if the stock is a robe of embroidery... the likes of which merchants' chests never contained.\nWoven in the borders of spring, but... the hand of rains embellished its embroidery.\nChamomile and lily of beautiful blossom... and embellished mugwort with buphthalmun.\nSo seize the negligence of time and hasten... and snatch the pleasure of short nights.'\n\nKushajim is Abu al-Fath Mahmoud bin al-Husayn the Scribe; he had beautiful poetry, a delicate nature, and good description. He has many books and novel compilations. From his poetry regarding a boy he used to associate with:\n'Who will excuse me regarding the cheeks of a fawn... who exposed the heart to causes of destruction?\nA moon, the bliss of beauty roamed in... the water of his cheeks upon the water of luxury.\nHe has a line of downy hair written by... the splendor of glory with the pens of honor.\nWisdom in softness, embroidered... with an embroidery that did not pass the limit of the earring.\nIt pinched his cheeks then bent... Ah, how beautiful is that bending.\nThe hair knew that he who hastened it... was unjust to him, so it stopped.\nSo in its stopping, it confesses... to reaching the limit in transgression and excess.'\n\nHe has in the description of an Oud:\n'She came with an oud whose tone is like... the voice of a girl complaining of a youth's separation.\nSurrounded, souls surrounded it... as if flowers grew around it.\nIts pegs turned in it and differed... like the difference of palms when interlaced.\nIf you moved it behind a defeated man... on a post-horse, he would turn back.'\n\n'O the beauty of their voices, as if they are... two sisters in a craft corresponding with each other.\nAnd he, upon this, substitutes if she falls silent... from her, and she substitutes from him if he falls silent.'\n\nHe has regarding that:\n'And a female singer leaning over a crooner... who has a loud voice but no hoarseness.\nIf you contemplate the gut from it, you think it... contains satiety while it is perforated, empty.\nHe has tones that lead from every listener... to where wine does not lead its drinker.\nIf she strikes it with fingertips and there meets... upon its body from her body the chest and the bosom.\nIt wept with joy, so amusement laughed towards it... and the bonds of causes were broken and patience stolen.\nAnd the right hand grants it a detailed accounting... so it carries in it the five, the six, and the ten [musical intervals/rhythms].\nSo die a victim of drunkenness, the best death... for clemency is nothing but that drunkenness makes you foolish.'\n\nFrom his beautiful poetry:\n'They say: Repent, while the cup is in the hand of a lithe one... and the voice of the second and third strings is loud.",

    "text": "I said to them: If I had harbored repentance... and saw all this, it would have appeared to me [to break it].'\n\nHe has describing a harp (Ma'zifa):\n'Suspended of strings, noisy... it has a yearning like the yearning of a stranger.\nIt exceeded the lute in goodness and has... wandered from the flute with a wondrous creation.\nIts insides are clothed in a skin... white, from the skin of a raised gazelle.\nAs if its nine strings... set up traps to hunt hearts.'\n\nHe has regarding a plectrum:\n'O arrogant one, coquettish with his beauty... be generous to the lover, for you are worthy of generosity.\nBy accepting a plectrum that resembled you in its beauty... good of bending, slender, shaped.\nResembling you when you step playfully... and sway between bodies and necklaces.\nDo not let the envious gloat at me by rejecting it... may every envious female and male ransom you.\nI did not gift it to you, O my desire, but... I gifted it seeking closeness to the Oud.'\n\nHe has elegizing a cup of his that broke:\n'I have tragedies for calamities... but not like our tragedy with the cup.\nThe vessel of wine and the crown of fingertips... and the friend of joy and banisher of sorrow.\nIt returns his image to the person... so if you took it as a mirror, it would serve.\nIt almost, with the water if it touched it... due to what is in it of resemblance, flows away.\nSo a persistent creditor of Time... caused me to lose it despite [my] stinginess with it.\nAs if he has an eye that selects... so he does not intend other than the witty.'\n\nSo do not go far, for how many a gut... is wounded over you, and a heart ulcerated.'\n\nHe has regarding the Nile:\n'As if the Nile when it came to Egypt... and overflowed in it and the canals were broken.\nAnd surrounded the villages from every side... skies whose stars are lost.'\n\nHe said regarding the melon:\n'And a good one who gifted us a good thing... so the gift guided us to the giver.\nO picker of the melon from its planting... you picked the fruit of praise from it.\nIt did not come to us until there came with it... scents that sufficed instead of incense.\nAs if the knife reveals from it... saffron mixed in honey.\nAs if inside it is wine... in which Indian aloe is soaked.'\n\nIn what we have brought of his novel poetry and strange descriptions is sufficiency that fulfills the condition and does not exceed the limit.\n\n**Dayr Qunna (Monastery of Qunna)**\n**Also known as Dayr Mar Mari al-Salih**\n\nThis monastery is sixteen farsakhs from Baghdad, descending on the eastern side. Between it and the Tigris is a mile and a half, and between it and Dayr al-Aqul is a post-stage (Barid). It is a beautiful, pleasant, populated monastery. In it are one hundred cells for its monks and those devoted to worship within it; each monk has a cell. They buy and sell these cells among themselves for from one thousand dinars to two hundred dinars to fifty dinars. Around each cell is a garden containing all fruits, palm trees, and olives. Its yield is sold from two hundred dinars to fifty dinars. There is a great wall surrounding it. In its center is a flowing river. Its feast where people gather is the Feast of the Cross. Poets have described it.\n\nIbn Jumhur said about it:\n'O abode of amusement at Dayr Qunna... my heart has yearned for those hills.\nHail to your days when we were... gathering pleasure and beauty from you.\nDays, no life was softer than ours... when we got intoxicated and sobered up, we returned.\nAnd if a jar finished, we broached a jar... until it was thought we had gone mad.\nAnd a helper [cupbearer] in all we wanted... resembling for us the moist, flexible branch.\nThe most beautiful of God's creation performed a melody... and plucked the high string of his oud and sang.\nBy God, O priest, O Ma Qunna... when did you see the nasal-voiced fawn?\nWhen did you see my temptation, John (Yuhanna)... Ah, when he sways or bends.\nO wish of the heart when it wishes... you assassinated the lover tormented by you.\nThen you turned the shield in love... you tortured him with love, art by art.\nAnd the earth became a prison upon him... so his eyelid does not meet an eyelid [in sleep].\nI ransom you, do not abandon a wasting lover... who was safe from your treachery.\nI did badly when I thought good of you... and my heart became a pawn in your hands.'\n\nHe also said about it:",

    "text": "'And how many a stand at Dayr Qunna I stood... flirting in it with a charming, wide-eyed one.\nAnd how many an impulsive act of mine in it I have not forgotten its goodness... I killed a custom with it and revived a forbidden act.'\n\nHe is Abu Ali Muhammad bin al-Husayn bin Jumhur al-Qummi. His father was among the narrators of the People of the House (Ahl al-Bayt), peace be upon them, and carriers of traditions from them. Abu Ali was witty, literary, with beautiful poetry and writing. He traveled in search of knowledge, threw himself into places of play, associated with people of licentiousness, and visited taverns and monasteries. Then he resided in Basra, his condition improved there, and he acquired much wealth.\n\nFrom his poetry regarding a slave girl who was among the singing girls (Qiyan), known as Zad Mahr, the slave girl of Al-Mansuriyah—and he had witty stories with her among the Qiyan, then it became possible for him to buy her—is his saying:\n'Perhaps a matter is considered difficult and unlikely... while it is near.\nMan gets what he desires... in the purity of time.\nSo the humbled, despairing one sees... the attainment of wishes.\nHe has engaged what he hoped for... in envy and safety.'\n\nHe also said:\n'How much the vicissitudes of time have shown us of wonder... and of a lover severe in illness and pain.\nTime cleared for him until he attained his desire... from the one he loved with the easiest request.'\n\nHis stories with her and other singing girls are amazing. This Zad Mahr said to him once, while she was among the Qiyan and he had invited her: 'Take the omen for me regarding something I have concealed.' He took the stamp (or geomancy instrument) and cast it, saying: 'You asked about a man sick of heart, severe in distress, constant in thought, long in bewilderment, who is on the brink of a great matter in obedience to a dear human.' She laughed, then said quickly: 'Upon the clitoris of the mother of the liar! By God, I asked only about the solid cloth you promised me, when will you send it to me?' He was ashamed and sent it to her.\n\nHe once embroidered a handkerchief with these verses and sent it to her:\n'I am a messenger from a lover... whose tears are flowing on his cheek.\nThis is Ibn Jumhur, so be generous to him... with yourself as he desires, O cruel one.\nFor the soul, even if your love has wasted it... O its mistress, is not forgetting.'\n\nShe returned the handkerchief, having embroidered in its center: 'Is it one who mocks us until his adulterer fucks us!'\n\nHe wrote to her, after she had shunned him:\n'O mistress of her slave, by God, what reached you is false, but I admit it in obedience to you, and I say as Rabi'ah al-Asadi said:\n\"Consider me a man who committed a sin out of ignorance... and I did not come to it intentionally, and the forbearing one may be ignorant.\nGod forgave what has passed, I am not returning... and here I am withdrawing from your anger.\"\n\nAnd I also said:\n\"My hope, if I missed... my right guidance in your love.\nIndeed, I have kept an eye awake... that was sleepless at your sleep.\nSo forgive me and be generous... I have made myself your ransom.\"'\n\nShe signed on the back of the note: 'Why do you distress yourself and be pedantic in writing poems? Send the tunic (Ghulala), and we have reconciled!'\n\nHe has regarding her:\n'Your enemies spent the night as I spent it... and your envier met what I met.\nO you whom I was miserable by loving... connect, may I not be miserable as I was miserable.\nI did not betray your covenant as long as I lived... nor cut off nor forgot.\nBe how you wish, for I... observe your affection as long as I remain.'\n\nHe said to her one day: 'O whore!' She said to him: 'O son of two whores!' He said to her: 'Woe to you, I say to you O whore, and you say to me O son of two whores?' She said: 'Yes! I am refractive (Shamus), I return with the pair (double)!'\n\nWe used to attend his assembly in Basra, and he would dictate the news of the People of the House, peace be upon them. When he finished dictating, his slave girls would begin and recite with melodies, then recite ascetic poems. When they finished that, whoever left would leave, and he would detain those he was familiar with, and singing and drinking would take place.\n\nHe said: Abdun bin Makhlad, the brother of Sa'id bin Makhlad, upon the death of his brother and his release from prison, went to Dayr Qunna, stayed there, and worshipped. This Abdun was lacking in craft, severely backward. Yet he reached a great status in the days of his brother. He said: Riq the singer gifted Abdun early fruit, including figs, pomegranates, and others. He said to his scribe: 'Write her the answer to her note in verse.' He swore that he had never said poetry! Abdun got very angry and said: 'You have been before me for years and do not do well with the seven odes? O donkey, write to her:\n\"Your two gifts came to us... on your festival day (Mihrajan).\nAnd we ate of your pomegranates... because you are our Janjan and we are your Janjan.\"'",

    "text": "Sa'id was among the leading men in determination, control, competence, generosity, and nobility. He performed many charities and prayers night and day. During his vizierate for Al-Muwaffaq, he would ride to Al-Muwaffaq's house, stay in his presence for four hours, then return to his home to look into people's needs and the affairs of the present and absent until noon. Then he would have lunch and sleep. Then he would sit in the evening to look into the Sultan's works until the last evening prayer, not leaving until he tallied all funds: what was brought to us, what was spent, and what remained. A report of that was made for him every day and presented to him, and nothing of what happened in the works every day was hidden from him. Then he would order regarding his estates and causes, and instruct his agents and retinue with what was needed. Then he would occupy himself after that with a boon companion, engaging in his conversation and finding comfort in him. Then he would sleep, and rise in the last part of the night, praying until the dawn rose. Then he would permit people to enter and greet him, then ride to Al-Muwaffaq's house.\n\nHe said: When Sa'id returned from Fars, Al-Muwaffaq complained to him about the matter of Amr bin al-Layth, the lack of funds, and what was needed to mobilize the army. He requested him to scheme for money to send Rashid out to Al-Saffar. He said: By God, I have no trick other than restricting expenses and withholding from the mercenaries. Al-Muwaffaq said: 'Where does that fall regarding what I need? What I want is for you to take a loan from the merchants and impose a tax on them, on yourself, on the scribes, and the workers, money we can use to send Rashid out. When we have abundance, we will return it to them.' Sa'id was distressed by that and wanted to use a trick to distance himself from him. He said: 'As for in Wasit, it is not possible for me. But if the Emir permits me to go to the City of Peace (Baghdad), I hope to scheme for what he wants.' He said: 'Resolve on that.' And he wrote to his son Abu al-Abbas to seize what belonged to Sa'id in Surra Man Ra'a and Baghdad and all his causes.\n\nIshaq bin Ibrahim the Scribe said: I saw Sa'id on the day he was arrested, reluctant to go to Al-Muwaffaq. I kept at him until he sat in the boat (Tayyar) while he was extremely hateful of it. He arrived at Al-Muwaffaq's presence. Al-Muwaffaq had agreed with Rashid to march to Sa'id's house upon his arrival before him, and seize what was in it, his son, and his causes. When Sa'id saw the army on the bridge during his march, he said: 'What is this, may God strengthen the Emir?' He said: 'Rashid asked my permission to review his men who are going out with him to Fars, and he has gone to review them.' He said: 'Then I will stand and go towards them and attend the review of the camels with him.' He said: 'Do so.' Sa'id jumped to go, but was diverted to the room prepared for him, and guards were set over him. What he had in Wasit was seized, and his brother Abdun and all their wealth were seized in one day. The yield of the estates seized from him, his brother, and his son amounted to one million dinars. And of goods, clothing, perfume, jewelry, furnishings, and instruments, what had no value due to its abundance was found for them, and about four thousand heads of beasts and mules, and four thousand slaves between stallion and servant. Only about two hundred thousand dinars of apparent money were found for him. Then he laid his hand on uncovering their funds, deposits, and confiscating their causes; it was a huge affair. He remained imprisoned until the year two hundred ninety-five, then was moved to the house of Ibn Tahir, where he died from a diarrhea that afflicted him. He was buried opposite the house known by him. His brother Abdun died, while being a monk at Dayr Qunna, in the year three hundred and ten.\n\n**'Umr Kaskar (Monastery of Kaskar)**\n\nIt is below Wasit, on its eastern side, in the village known as Barjuni. In it is the Seat of the Metropolitan. It is a large, great monastery, well-built, firmly constructed. Around it are many cells; each cell is for a monk, and their way is the way of the cells in Dayr Qunna. Many gardens surround the place containing trees, palm trees, and all fruits. Every witty person visits it, and every sad person finds solace in it.\n\nMuhammad bin Hazim has [poetry] in it—he had intended it during the stay of Al-Hasan bin Sahl in Wasit, and he praised Al-Hasan bin Sahl, and he has a story with him we will mention after the poetry:\n'At 'Umr Kaskar amusement and joy were good... and mementos, rounds, and selections.\nAnd youths who sacrificed themselves for the cup... and obligated for the foster-brother of the cup what is obligatory.\nThey spent in the path of revelry what they found... and plundered what they had in it and what they earned.\nPreservers, if you sought their help they paid... and generous, if you asked them for gifts they gave.\nI drank with noble masters among them... refined, to whom noble masters gave lineage.\nWe did not cease in the gardens of the monastery populating them... with revelry, and pleasures and joy overwhelmed us.\nThe flowers laugh and the stars are weeping... and the flute aids and the strings clamor.",

    "text": "And the cup in the orbit of pleasures is circling... running, and we are poles to it in its rotation.\nAnd Time, its eyes have turned away from us... so events and calamities do not frighten us.'\n\nMuhammad bin Hazim was one of the naturally gifted poets; he excelled in every art he rode and came up with meanings that were closed to others. Most of his poetry was on contentment, praising preservation, and dispraising greed and covetousness.\n\nMuhammad bin Hazim mentioned, saying: A need arose for me in the camp of Al-Hasan bin Sahl, so I came to him, having recited poetry in the ship. I entered upon Muhammad bin Sa'id bin Salim al-Bahili, introduced myself to him, so he knew me, lodged me, and honored my stay. Then he said to me: 'What did you say about the Emir?' I said: 'I haven't said anything yet.' A man who was with me in the ship said: 'Yes, he has said verses.' He asked me to recite them to him, so I recited:\n'They told me you praised a generous youth... I said: And how can I get a generous youth?\nI have tested people for fifty years... and the experienced one is sufficient for you as a knower.\nNo one prepares for a day of good... nor does anyone return [favor] to an intimate friend.\nAnd a youth impresses me and I think good... then I uncover from him a mean man.\nThey resembled each other so they became... sons of two parents, cut from one leather.\nPeople circled Al-Hasan bin Sahl... their circling of Zamzam and Al-Hatim.\nAnd they said a master who gives abundantly... and removes the distress of the suppressed man.\nI said my poetry went in blaming the people... and the healthy might be approached from the sick.\nAnd news interpreted by conjectures is not... more healing than the witnessing of the prudent.\nSo if what spreads about him is true... I return with the equipment of the resident man.\nAnd if it is other than that, I praise my Lord... and doubt is removed about a prudent man.\nIt is not money that turns me to him... but the generous is the brother of the generous.'\n\nWhen I recited the poetry to him, he said: 'With the likes of this you meet the Emir? By God, if he were your peer, it would not be permissible for you to address him with this.' I said: 'You spoke the truth, and that is why I said I did not praise him. But I will praise him with a praise that befits him.' He said: 'Do so!' He entered upon Al-Hasan, told him the news, and recited the poetry to him, and he marveled at the quality of the last verse. He ordered my admission to him without praise. I was admitted. He ordered me to recite the poetry, so I asked to be excused. He did not excuse me, and said: 'I have accepted this excuse, since you did not include me in the group you blamed! And with this, we owe you a good reward.' I recited it to him, so he laughed and said: 'Woe to you! What is it with you and people that you encompass them with satire? Enough of this pattern now, and spare them.' I said: 'I have gifted them to the Emir!' He said: 'I have accepted, and I demand fulfillment from you, the demand of one who was gifted a gift and accepted it.' Then he gave me a gift and was generous. So I said about him, and recited to him:\n'I gifted the people to Al-Hasan bin Sahl... so he compensated me with abundant reward.\nAnd he said: Leave satire and speak beautifully... for the goal is closer to correctness.\nSo I said to him: I am innocent to you of them... would that they were at the end of the dust.\nWere it not for the favor of Al-Hasan bin Sahl... upon me, I would have subjected them to evil torment.\nI plot against them the plotting of enemies... and trick them the tricking of wolves.\nThey were not transformed into dogs, except that I... saw the people as likenesses of dogs.'\n\nHe laughed and then said: 'Woe to you! Just now you started satirizing them; they haven't escaped you yet.' I said: 'This is a remnant that overflowed on my heart, and I will refrain from them as long as God keeps the Emir.'\n\nHe said: Muhammad bin Hazim had become ascetic and left drinking wine (Nabidh). He entered one day upon Ibrahim bin Shakla, conversed with him, and ate with him. Ibrahim sat to drink and asked him to drink with him. He refused, and said:\n'After fifty I yearn?... And gray hair is a war to ignorance.\nAge, gray hair, and ignorance... is a matter, by your life, difficult.\nO son of the Imam, why not... when the days of my wood were moist?\nAnd the gray of my head was little... and the spring of love sweet?\nAnd when my arrows were hitting the mark... and the blade of my sword sharp?\nAnd when the cure of beautiful women... from me was talk and closeness?\nSo now, when the blamers saw in me... what they liked.\nAnd a people sensed guidance from me... I am blamed if I yearn.\nI swore not to drink a cup... as long as a caravan performs Hajj for God.'",

    "text": "Hamdan bin Yahya mentioned, saying: The last thing I parted from Muhammad bin Hazim upon was that he said to me: 'Nothing of pleasures remains for me except selling cats!' He said: I said to him: 'May God heat your eye! What pleasure do you have in selling cats?' He said: 'The foolish old woman pleases me when she quarrels with me, saying: \"This is my cat, it was stolen from me,\" so I say to her: \"You lied,\" then she insults me and I insult her, and she quarrels with me and I quarrel with her!' He said: And he recited to me:\n'Connect a wine with a hangover... and connect a hangover with a wine.\nAnd take your share of it... as provision to where you know.'\nI said: 'To where, woe to you?' He said: 'To the Abyss (Hell), you fool!'\n\nFrom his beautiful poetry is his saying:\n'O son of Sa'id, you passed the limit of kindness with me... and burdened me with what I cannot bear of thanks.\nAnd if a man gave you the effort of his thanks... and passed away without reaching your extent, he is excused.\nA state changes for a youth after a state... and free favors remain for a free youth.'\n\nFrom his good poetry is his saying:\n'And I am possessor of affection for the one whose affection lasts... and harsh to the one who desires harshness, easily bored.\nAnd indeed a man who takes shelter in a house of humiliation... where hope enslaves him is humiliated.\nAnd in despair from the humiliation of ambitions is rest... and among people, for those you do not like, is a substitute.'\n\nHe said regarding contentment:\n'I praise God, thanking... for His trial is good and beautiful.\nI became covered, healthy... roaming among His blessings.\nEmpty of sorrows, light of... back, the little satisfies me.\nNo greed makes me miserable, nor... covetousness, nor long hope.\nEqual to me is the wealthy... waster and the miserly man.\nAnd I banished wishes with despair... from me, so the resting place became pleasant for me.\nAnd all people, to the one... whose burden is light, are friends.'\n\nMuhammad bin Hazim said: Some of the Tahirids sent me—and I had exaggerated in satirizing him and exceeded the limit—one thousand dirhams and a chest of clothes, and said: 'As for what has passed, there is no way to return it, but I would like you not to add anything to it.' So I returned the dirhams and clothes, and wrote to him:\n'I do not wear favors from a man... whom I clothed in shame forever.'\nThen I refrained from satirizing him.\n\nHe said: Sa'id bin Mas'ud al-Qatrabbuli was a friend of mine. I asked him for a need, but he turned me away from it. So I cut him off. He sent me one thousand dirhams and tried to please me. I returned them and wrote to him:\n'Wide of chest, spacious for what... the changing, turning [heart] narrows from.\nHe returned with favor so I accepted it... and perhaps the sinner makes amends.\nYes, time fulfilled, despite that it is... entrusted with separation, being asked for favor.\nHail and care to a time passed... from me, and the arrow of the gloater is the most disappointed.\nA little money came to me from you, but I did not... expose myself to it, and the free man does not lie.\nMy taking money from you after what... you bestowed upon me is a mount that is difficult.\nI refused to drink at satisfaction... and anger except a drink that is sweet.\nDespair strengthened me and enriched me, so I do not... hope for other than God nor fear.\nKorah (Qarun) to me, in wealth, is destitute... and my ambition is a doctrine above that.\nSo with which of these two do you see me... yearning for your money or desiring?'\n\nFrom his poetry on contentment is his saying:\n'Whoever employs despair, despair makes him... magnified forever in the eyes of people.\nAnd whoever throws the eye of the covetous at them sees... humiliation, and sips the bitterness of denial in a cup.\nDespair is better, and people have no fruit... bring a man who was humiliated before people after despair.'\n\nHe said in this meaning:\n'I made despair the mount of hopes... so it sheltered me to a spacious side.\nThat mount of hopes is unmarked... without a saddle tied nor straps.\nBy your life, for the little I protect my face... with it among the solitary and among the group.\nIs more beloved to me than my asking for much... to which the necks of submission are stretched.\nSo live by nourishment day by day... like the sucking of the child at the times of the udders.\nAnd do not desire from anyone with greed... neither high among mankind nor lowly.\nYouth has departed and gray hair has settled... so do you have any return to your youth?'",

    "text": "Muhammad bin Hazim said: I entered upon Al-Ma'mun. When I stood before him, he said: 'How is your insight into the days of people and the news of the Arabs?' I said: 'I am on the racecourse, let my rein be released!' He said: 'Recite whatever appears to you.' So I left what he hinted at and worked on fixing my own affair, saying [to myself]: 'A Caliph's assembly, and I am not safe from a mishap.' So I recited to him:\n'I was granted intellect but was not granted its chivalry... and chivalry is nothing but the abundance of money.\nIf I want to soar, the thinness of my condition holds me back... from what praises my name.'\n\nAl-Ma'mun said: 'The Sheikh complains of the thinness of his condition; let one thousand dirhams be given to him,' and he smiled. I said: 'Behind the smile is nothing but good,' so I recited to him:\n'You are a sky and my hand is its earth... and the earth may hope for the rain of the sky.\nSo plant a hand [favor] with me that is praiseworthy... you will harvest with it among people good praise.'\n\nHe said: 'This meaning is stronger than the first,' and ordered two thousand dirhams for me. Then he said: 'You deceived me!' I said: 'Two verses on deception have come to me.' He said: 'What are they?' So I recited to him:\n'And if you come to the generous one with a deception... and you see him hastening in what you desire.\nThen know that you did not deceive an ignorant one... indeed the generous one feigns deception by his action.'\n\nHe said: 'They are, by God, better than the first.'

He asked me to recite to him, so I recited:\n'Let not annoyance from a solicitor burden you... for the best of your time is to be seen as asked.\nDo not meet with prevention the face of a hoper... for the survival of your glory is to be seen as hoped for.\nAnd know that you are shortly becoming... news, so be news that pleases, beautiful.\nThe generous is met and his cheerfulness indicates him... and you see the frown on the mean as an indicator.'\n\nHe said: 'How excellent you are! How beautiful are your meanings! Boy, write a check for him for the like of what we gave him.'\n\nHe has in this art and others everything beautiful. Were it not for the book exceeding its drawn limit and the fear of lengthiness, I would have presented of the best of his poetry and beauties what the listener would delight in. In what we have presented is sufficiency.\n\n**Monasteries of Egypt intended for drinking and picnicking, among them:**\n\n**Dayr al-Qusayr (The Little Palace Monastery)**\n\nThis monastery is at the top of the mountain, on the surface of its peak. It is a monastery of beautiful construction, sturdy craftsmanship, pleasant spot. Monks reside in it. It has a well carved in stone from which water is drawn for it. In its altar is the image of Mary with the image of the Messiah, peace be upon him, in her lap. People visit the place to look at this image. At its top is a room built by Abu al-Jaysh Khumarawayh bin Ahmad bin Tulun, having four windows to four directions. He used to visit this monastery frequently, admiring the image in it, drinking while looking at it. The road to this monastery from the direction of Egypt (Cairo/Fustat) is difficult. As for from its southern side, the ascent and descent are easy. Beside it is a hermitage that is never without a recluse in it. It overlooks the village known as Shahran and the desert and the river (Nile/Sea). This mentioned village is a large populated village on the bank of the river; they mention that Moses, peace be upon him, was born in it, and from it his mother threw him into the river in the ark. So this Dayr al-Qusayr is one of the intended monasteries for the beauty of its location and its overlooking of Egypt and its districts. The poets of Egypt have spoken about it and mentioned its goodness and pleasantness.\n\nAbu Hurayra ibn Abi al-Isam has [poetry] in it:\n'How much revelry I had at Dayr al-Qusayr... with every person of youthful passion and wit.\nI played in it with a coquettish fawn... description falls short of his novelties.'\n\nHe also said in it:\n'You reminded me, O monastery, of those who passed... of my people of affection and sincere friendship.\nHow much good days and nights I had... in you and among them together.\nI complain to God of my calamity regarding them... and our loss of the people of chivalries.'\n\nMuhammad bin Asim has, in this monastery:\n'Indeed Dayr al-Qusayr stirred my remembrance... the amusement of my beautiful short days.\nAnd a time that passed praiseworthy, fast... and a youth like the borrowed robe.\nIts quarters knew me after denial... so I knew the quarters by denial.\nIf dwellings complained of longing... they would have complained of my harshness and the distance of my visiting.\nAnd they would have almost walked towards me because of what... I had sent of my poems in them.\nAs if I, when I visited it after abandonment... had not been of my homes and dwellings.\nWhen my ascent was on horses to it... and my descent in the embracing ships.\nWith hawks thirsty for blood... and dogs predatory against wild beasts.",

O my friend, in the monastery, in the best place.\nDayr al-Qusayr, unique in its attributes...

Beside it are gardens, some of which were established by Emir Tamim, brother of the Commander of the Faithful Al-Aziz Billah, peace be upon them both. And a sitting room on columns, of beautiful construction and pretty craftsmanship, painted, established by Emir Tamim also. Near this monastery is a well known as Bir Najati, upon which is a sycamore tree; people gather at it and drink by it. This place is one of the places of play and spots of amusement and joy. It is pleasant in the days of the Nile [flood] and its increase and the fullness of the lake, beautiful in view, pleasant in spots, and likewise in the days of cultivation and blossoms. It is hardly devoid of those throwing themselves [into leisure] and picnickers. Poets have mentioned its beauty and goodness.\n\nIbn Asim has [poetry] in it:\n'O goodness of days I poured with youth... obedient to passion in them at the foot of Al-Manzar.\nAnd the lush Lake, and the Monastery which... has stirred the excess of my passion and thinking.\nSo urge your cups, O boy, and excuse me... for I have become drunk and the wine of your glance is my intoxicant.\nAnd I see the Pleiades in the sky as if they are... a crown whose sides are detailed with jewels.\nSo drink to the beauty of the gardens and sing to me... Look at the nasal-voiced, wide-eyed cupbearer.\nFor perhaps the days of life are few... and perhaps I estimated what was not destined.'\n\nHe also said:\n'Turn my mounts to the sycamore of Al-Arja... at the foot of Helwan and stop at the two berries (Al-Tutat).",

    "text": "Nahya is in Giza. Its monastery is one of the best monasteries, most pleasant and good, populated by its monks and inhabitants. It has a wondrous view in the Nile [flood], because the water surrounds it from all its sides. When the water recedes and it is cultivated, its lands show strange blossoms and varieties of flowers. It is one of the described parks and famous spots. It has a canal to which all birds gather, so it is also a good hunting ground. Poets have described it and mentioned its beauty and the goodness of its location.\n\nAl-Abbas bin al-Basri has [poetry] in it:\n'O you whom, when the boon companion gets drunk with his cup... his glances are seduced by the drunkenness of the awkward one.\nThe morning rose, so give me drink of that which... was wronged, so its color was likened to the lily.\nAnd meet the morning with the light of your face, for it... the joyful one does not meet until he meets.\nMy heart in which nothing of your love remains... except a remnant of a fire of longing that remained.\nDo you not see the face of spring, and its flowers... have boasted in its shining day?\nAnd its birds answered each other and its trees... smiled revealing the mouth of an elegant flower.\nThe dew of the drizzle did not feed it with its cold... until every closed eyelid opened.\nAnd the full moon in the middle of the sky is as if... it is a beautiful face in a blue mask.\nO for the beautiful monasteries and what is in them... of a good day passed for me with yearning.\nDays I was, and I had occupation with them... and the captive of the longing of my passion was not released.\nO Dayr Nahya, I did not mention you for an hour... except I remembered the youth in my parting.\nAnd time was fresh and the era aiding... and our stay and our overnight were in the pavilion (Jawsaq).\nO Dayr Nahya, if you are mentioned, then I... strive towards you the extent of racing horses.\nAnd if you are asked about the birds and their hunting... and their genera, speak truth even if you are not believed.\nThe coot, the curlew, the farur when... it grieves you in its circling flight.\nI witnessed the war of birds in its thickets... when every grouper grouped from it.\nAnd the angry zammuj (bird of prey) in a group of his... swoops down between thundering and flashing.\nAnd I saw for the hawk the power of a rich man... and for others the humiliation of the destitute poor.\nHow often I played in my youth in my zeal... and cut my times by shooting pellets.\nAnd I cast off my ropes in seeking licentiousness... until I was attributed to the deeds of the clumsy.\nAnd a shunner, arrogant, averse... the heart is anxious because of him even if he is not anxious.\nIf the apple saw the redness of his cheek... it would yearn for the brocade of that splendor.\nO carrier of the sword in the morning, and his glance... is sharper than the drawn cutting sword.\nBe gentle with your slave, do not prolong his sorrows... and be gentle with him, O owner of the pure mouth.'\n\nHe also said:\n'Are you active for drinking, O my master... for this day of yours is fine of seams.\nI have for you today two roast chickens... I stole them from the old woman's chickens.\nAnd fifty eggs like stars... she hid them from me inside a jug.\nSo I tricked her and took them... and she did not benefit from the guarded place.\nAre you active at my place for two lotus fruits (nabq)... for two almonds, for a jar.\nAnd we head to Nahya and a monastery of hers... in it is the place of roses and marjoram.\nAnd we drink in it with a rotl and a cup... and a goblet and drafts with a mug.\nAs for the birds, due to excess joy... they are between the gardens and the planted shoots.\nThis one shouts at accidents: ...

    "text": "This Ibn al-Basri was one of the dissolute libertines. He has poetry that runs the course of jest and humor. He served Abu al-Qasim Unujur bin al-Ikhshid, so he treated him well, clothed him, and he began to ride with him. He used to wear a blue shawl (Taylasan), resembling the judges. Unujur had mounted him on a thick yellow packhorse, slow of pace. Whenever he rode with groups of his brothers, he would say to them: 'Describe your location to me so I can catch up with you!' He was pleasant in companionship, frequent in jokes. He used to sell pharmacy goods in the Mosque of Abdullah in Egypt.\n\n**Dayr Tamwayh (Monastery of Tamwayh)**\n\nTamwayh is in the West (Giza side) opposite Helwan. The monastery overlooks the river (sea), and around it are vineyards, orchards, palm trees, and trees. It is pleasant, populated, inhabited. It has a beautiful view in the Nile [flood]. When the land turns green, it is between two carpets of the river and the crops. It is one of the mentioned parks of Egypt and its famous places of amusement.\n\nIbn Asim has [poetry] in it:\n'Shorten your blame of me today, for I... am not of solace nor refraining.\nSo may God water Dayr Tamwayh with rain... with morning clouds connected to night clouds.\nHow many nights I was awakened from the sleep of my drunkenness... by the chanting of monks at dawn.\nAnd the bells shouting, calling... Come alive, O sleeper, early in the morning.'\n\nHe also said in it:\n'And drink at Tamwayh of a pure wine... surpassing the wine of the villages of Hit and Ana.\nUpon gardens of blossoms shining... streams flow from them between gardens.\nAs if the growth of the safflower anemone in it... is cups of wine appearing after cups.\nAs if its narcissus in its beauty is pupils... secretly conversing with signals.\nAs if the Nile in the passing of the breeze on it... is clad in coats of mail.\nDwellings I was fascinated by as a lad... and they were of old my brothels and taverns.\nSince I do not cease persisting in the morning drink to... the striking of bells, fond of the monasteries.'\n\n**The Monasteries Known for Wonders, according to what their people mentioned and described about them. Among them:**\n\n**Dayr al-Khanafis (Monastery of the Beetles)**\nIt is between Mosul and Balad, large, with many monks. It has a day in the year when people gather to it from every place. Beetles appear in it that day until they cover its walls, ceilings, and ground, and all of it turns black from them. When it is the second day, which is the feast of the monastery, they gather to the altar, consecrate, offer sacrifice, and leave, and the beetles have disappeared so that nothing of them is seen until that time [next year].\n\n**Dayr al-Kalb (Monastery of the Dog)**\nIt is between Mosul and Balad. In it, whoever is bitten by a rabid dog is treated. Whoever is bitten by a rabid dog hastens to it, they treat him, and he is cured. Whoever has passed forty days since the bite, the treatment does not succeed.\n\n**Dayr al-Qayyarah (Monastery of Bitumen)**\nIt belongs to the Jacobites, four farsakhs from Mosul, on the western side, in the district of Al-Haditha, overlooking the Tigris. Beneath it is a bitumen spring, which is a spring gushing with hot water pouring into the Tigris, and bitumen comes out of it. As long as the bitumen is in its water, it is soft and stretches; if it leaves the water and cools, it dries. There are people who gather there and collect this bitumen, ladling it from its water with baskets, and throwing it on the ground. It has large iron pots, and sand is sifted for it. It is thrown onto it in a measure they know and fire is lit under it until it melts and mixes with the sand, while they stir it constantly. When it reaches the limit of its firmness, it is turned onto the ground in solidified pieces, hardens, and is carried to the cities. Ships and baths are coated with it, and other things in which bitumen is used. People frequently intend this place to picnic in it and drink. They bathe in that water which comes out with the bitumen, because it stands in the stead of thermal springs in removing pimples. It has a caretaker (Qaim). Every monastery for the Jacobites and Melkites has a caretaker. As for the monasteries of the Nestorians, they have no caretaker.\n\n**Dayr Barquma**\nThis monastery is in Mayyafariqin, two farsakhs from it on a high mountain. It has a feast to which people gather, and it is intended for that. Vows are vowed to it and carried to it from every place. People of idleness and licentiousness intend it to drink in it. Beneath it are cisterns in which rainwater collects. Barquma is the witness (saint/relic) in it; the Christians claim he is seven hundred years old, and that he is one of those who witnessed the Messiah. He is in a wooden cabinet having doors that open on the days of their feasts. His upper half appears; he is standing, and his nose and upper lip are cut off. That is because a woman used a trick until she cut off his nose and lip and left with them, and built a monastery over them in the desert on the road to Tikrit.\n\n**Dayr Bata**",

    "text": "This monastery is in the East. It is a beautiful monastery, populated in the days of spring. It is also called Dayr al-Himar (Monastery of the Donkey). Its witness (saint) is known as Mariks. It is far from the Tigris and the city. It has a stone door; the Christians mentioned that this door is opened by one and two [people] until they exceed seven. If they exceed seven, none of them can open it, and it is not opened then except by seven. They also mentioned that there are two crows in it, breeding there, never devoid of them. Perhaps thieves raid it and enter it. If anyone gets inside, the two crows ascend to the meadow of the monastery. If someone approaches it who raids it or intends it [for harm], the two crows meet him screaming in his face as if warning him, so he knows there are people in the monastery, and returns. If there is no one in the monastery, they do nothing of that.\n\n**Dayr Mar Sham'un (Monastery of St. Simon)**\nIn the regions of Al-Sinn. In this monastery is the seat of the Bishop. There is also a well in it. Whoever is afflicted with vitiligo (Bahaq) intends it and washes from the well; he does not leave until it disappears from him.\n\n**Dayr al-Ajjaj**\nThis monastery is between Tikrit and Hit. Populated, with many monks. Outside it is a water spring pouring into a pool there. In the pool are black fish, good and sweet in taste. Around it are farms and vegetables watered from that spring.\n\n**Dayr al-Judi**\nAl-Judi is the mountain on which the Ship (Noah's Ark) settled. Between this mountain and Jazirat Ibn Umar are seven farsakhs. This monastery is built on the peak of the mountain. It is said it was built since the days of Noah, peace be upon him, and its building has not been renewed to this time. They claimed there is a wonder in it. Some Christians of Jazira told me about it: that its roof is measured by hand spans (Shibr), and it is twenty spans. Then it is measured again, and it is eighteen spans. Then again, and it is twenty-two spans. Every time it is measured, its number differs. And that he tested that and measured it and found it as mentioned.\n\n**Kanisat al-Tur (Church of the Mount)**\nTur Sina (Mount Sinai) is the mountain where He transfigured to Moses, peace be upon him, and he fell unconscious. The church is at the top of the mountain, built with black stone. The width of its fortress is seven cubits, and it has three iron doors. In its west is a small door with a stone of theirs before it; if they want to lift it, they lift it, and if someone intends them [harm], they drop it so it covers the place and the place of the door is not known. Inside it is a water spring and outside it is another spring. The Christians claimed that in it is a fire of the type of the New [Fire] (Holy Fire) that was in Jerusalem; they light from it every evening. It is white with weak heat, not burning, then it strengthens if lamps are lit from it. It is populated with monks, and people intend it because it is one of the described monasteries.\n\nIbn Asim has [poetry] in it:\n'O monk of the monastery, what is this light and illumination... for it has shone in your monastery, Al-Tur?\nHas the sun settled in it without its towers... or has the full moon disappeared in it so it is hidden?'\nHe said: 'Neither sun nor moon settled in it... but flasks [of wine] were offered in it today.'\n\n**Biya'at Abi Hur (Church of Abu Hur)**\nThis church is in Siryaqus in the province of Egypt. Populated, with many monks. It has feasts which people attend. In it, according to what its people mentioned, is a wonder: whoever has scrofula (Khanazir) intends this place to be treated in it. The head of the place takes him, lays him down, brings a pig, and sends it to the place of pain. The pig eats what is in it, not exceeding that place. When the place is cleaned, ash of a pig that did the same action before and oil from the church lamp are sprinkled on it, and it heals. Then that pig is taken, slaughtered, burned, and its ash prepared for the like of this case.\n\n**Dayr Yuhannis**\nThis monastery is in Damanhur, in the province of Egypt. When it is its feast day, its witness (saint) is brought out of the monastery in a coffin. The coffin travels on the face of the earth; no one can hold it or detain it until it reaches the river (sea), dives into it, then returns to its place.\n\n**Biya'at Atrib (Church of Athribis)**\nIts feast is the twenty-first day of Ba'una. They mention that a white dove comes to them on that feast. It enters the altar—they do not know where it came from—then they do not see it until a day like it [next year].\n\nAnd in the regions of Akhmim is a large, populated monastery, intended from every place. It is near the mountain known as the Mountain of the Cave. In a place of the mountain is a cleft. When it is the feast day of this monastery, not a single bird known as Buqir remains in that place—and they are many there—until it comes to the spot. It is a great matter due to their abundance, gathering, and screaming at that cleft. Then they do not cease, one after another, inserting its head into that cleft, screaming, and coming out, and another comes and does like its deed, until the head of one of them gets stuck and caught in the place. It struggles until it dies. Then the rest disperse and return to their places, and not a bird remains of them. And Allah knows best.\n\n**Conclusion of the Manuscript**",
