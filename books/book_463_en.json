    "text": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The earth is spherical, surrounded by water. Both are stationary at the center in the heart of the celestial spheres, and its circumference is three hundred and sixty degrees. Each degree is fifty miles, and a mile is four thousand cubits. The inhabited part of it has a longitude from the Eternal Islands (Canary Islands) in the Ocean in the West to the Sila Islands in the Ocean in the East of one hundred and eighty degrees. The visible part of it is rugged for the settling of seas and the flow of rivers. The latitude of the inhabited world from its furthest point in the South to its furthest point in the North is eighty degrees. What lies beyond that in the South is uninhabitable due to the intensity of the sun's heat at the perihelion there. What lies beyond it in the North is uninhabitable due to the intensity of the cold. The total inhabited area is divided into nine sections: The inhabited area behind the Equator to the South, and the Seven Climes graduating from the Line. Then the ninth section is the inhabited area beyond that to the furthest habitation in the North; explaining the reasons would be lengthy. The inhabited area behind the Equator to the South has a width of sixteen degrees. The Surrounding Ocean does not appear in it from the far West nor in the South. It consists of ten parts. Part One: Contains among the Sudanese cities the city of Kaw (City of the Naked), who are neglected like beasts as reported, where the longitude is ten degrees and the latitude is four. And Zafqu, where the longitude is thirteen degrees and the latitude is ten. Other than that are shifting sands and obliterated paths. Part Two: Contains types similar to the previous one, including Za'nah, where longitude is twenty-four degrees and latitude is seven. And Barsanah, where longitude is twenty-seven degrees and latitude is seven. In it is the first of the Nile rivers descending from a latitude of sixteen degrees from the end of habitation, which is the end of Part Two. Part Three: From its beginning where longitude is thirty-six degrees and minutes to longitude thirty-nine degrees and twenty minutes, and latitude sixteen degrees, are the four sources of the Nile which are after the fifth part and at the end of the second part mentioned earlier. They spring from the flatlands. The other five sources are also in the third part, except they are from the Moon Mountain (Jabal al-Qamar) where longitude is forty-eight degrees to fifty-two degrees and five minutes. The latitude in all these ten sources does not depart from sixteen degrees. The first five (rivers) pour into the first western lake (Batihah) where longitude is forty-two degrees, latitude seventy [sic, likely meant 7 or relative to equator], and diameter five degrees. The second eastern lake is two degrees away from the first, and the center in latitude is the same, as is the diameter. Five rivers exit from each lake, just as they enter from the northern side, except that the second and third from the two lakes become one river shortly after, and all pour into the Great Lake located in the First Clime. In this first region of Sudan is Rafalah, which is between the first two rivers, and between it and the lake is one degree. And Kushah, on springs extending to the last of the rivers from the second lake where longitude is fifty-three degrees and latitude two degrees. Beneath it flows the Nile of Mogadishu coming out north of the Line. The settlements of al-Qamar are between the two lakes, and the settlements of Akar are to their north up to Lake Kura. Part Four: Contains the end of the Moon Mountain according to Ptolemy's view, where longitude is fifty-one degrees fifty minutes and latitude eleven degrees. In it are the settlements of al-Qamar (the Moon people) to whom the mountain is attributed. They are brothers of the Chinese. Famous among them in this part of the Sudanese cities is Damdamah, from which the Damdam emerged against the lands of Nubia and Abyssinia in the year 617 AH, coinciding with the emergence of the Tatars against the lands of the Persians; they are the Tatars of the Sudan. In it is Qaljur, to which the Qaljurian swords are attributed; near it is a mine of superior iron from which they are made. It is where longitude is fifty-five degrees sixty minutes and latitude two degrees thirty minutes. And Berbera, the base of the Berbers whose horses Imru' al-Qais mentioned. Their slaves are appreciated. Most of them have converted to Islam, so they became scarce in Islamic lands. This city is where longitude is sixty-eight degrees and latitude six and a half.",

    "text": "The Nile of Mogadishu continues to ascend in this part until latitude eleven degrees where longitude is sixty-six degrees, then it descends to the east of Berbera, leaving about a degree between them, then descends to the east of Mogadishu. In this part, among the cities of Berbera—and it is the first of their cities on the coast of the Indian Ocean—is Qarfuna, located at the first corner of the sea where longitude is sixty-four degrees thirty minutes and latitude twenty minutes. East of it, among their cities on a high bay, is Barmah, where longitude is sixty-six degrees and latitude one degree. East of it is Hafuni (Hafun), the mountain famous among travelers. It appears entering the land southward about one hundred miles, and enters the sea about one hundred and forty miles to the north curving east. On its visible side are seven heads which travelers count from a distance and share good news when they pass them and clear that cape. East of it, among the famous towns of Berbera on the sea, is Markah (Merca), where longitude is sixty-nine degrees thirty minutes and latitude one degree ten minutes. Its people are Muslims, and it is the capital of the Hawiyah which exceeds fifty villages. It is on the bank of a river that branches from the Nile of Mogadishu and pours out two stages east of the city. From it, a branch forms the Basin of Markah. East of that is the city of Islam famous in that region and frequently mentioned by travelers, which is Mogadishu, where longitude is seventy-two degrees and latitude two degrees. It is on the Indian Ocean and its anchorage is not safe from storms. Part Five: At its beginning, at twelve minutes of the fourth part and latitude two degrees, is the mouth of the Nile of Mogadishu. It crosses its land leaving about twelve miles between them and pours into the Indian Ocean. In appearance, it is smaller than the Nile of Egypt near Mogadishu, but it is deep, and things branch from it that weaken its water. Ibn Fatimah said: This Nile exits from Lake Kura under the Equator from Mount Maqsim, a twin to the Nile of Egypt, at longitude fifty-one degrees and latitude half a degree in the First Clime. It winds and straightens, and rivers branch from it making those regions like the Egyptian lands in sugar and bananas, and like India in bdellium, coconut, and betel nut; all that and more is irrigated by it. They harvest twice, once on it and once on rain. It pours out east of Mogadishu, and its length is about two thousand miles. East of this Nile is the end of the Berber lands and the beginning of the land of the Zanj (East Africa). In this Fifth Part, among the famous cities of the Zanj is Malindah (Malindi), where longitude is eighty-one and a half degrees and latitude two and a half degrees and twenty minutes on a bay. West of it is a large inlet into which a river descends from the Moon Mountain. On the banks of this inlet are many settlements of the Zanj, and in the south are settlements of al-Qamar. East of Malindi is al-Harrani, a mountain famous among travelers, entering the sea about one hundred miles heading north with an eastward tilt, and appearing on land heading south straight for about fifty miles. Among its wonders is that the land part contains an iron mine common to the land of the Zanj and traded elsewhere, while the sea part contains lodestone that attracts iron. In this city are the sorcerers of the Zanj, and the residence of their kings is in the city of Mombasa. Between them is about a degree, and it is on the sea. West of it is a large inlet entered by ships for about two days and extending about three hundred miles. In this part is the desert between the Zanj and Sofala. In it, among the cities of Sofala, is Batinah. It is on the tail of a great bay entering the sea from the Equator four degrees, and the width of its head by curvature is two degrees. The city is where longitude is eighty-seven degrees ten minutes and latitude two and a half degrees. West of it, inside the north and east, is Ajrad. It is a mountain extending into the sea about one hundred miles. The waves make terrifying sounds there. It is a long inlet into which a river pours coming from the Moon Mountain, which is east of it. The length of the inlet and river is a month. On it are forests and settlements. The sea descends from this city a distance of a month until its coast is at the Equator where the Dome of Arin (Azayn) is, which is the pan of the balance of the earth, and from it to every direction is ninety degrees.",

    "text": "Part Six: In it, on the Indian Ocean, are settlements of the Sofalans and less famous cities until their capital, Sayuna, is located upon it, where longitude is ninety-nine degrees and latitude two and a half degrees. It is on a large inlet into which a river descends from the Moon Mountain to its west into a large bay, while the city is to its east. Its length from the Equator is five and a half degrees. In this city is the King of the Sofalans, who are Zanj people who worship idols and stones, pouring fish oil over them. Most of their livelihood comes from gold and iron, and their clothing is leopard skins. Horses do not live among them, so their army consists of foot soldiers. Al-Masudi mentioned that the Zanj fight on cows just as the Nuba fight on camels. From the east of this city, the Gulf of al-Qamar enters from the Indian Ocean to the furthest habitation in the South. Its width there is about two hundred miles. On this course and what approximates it, it passes like an arc to the South and East until it hits the Mountain of Regret (Jabal al-Nadamah) which will be mentioned. East of Sayuna is the Multam Mountain, which is large, extending with the coast of the gulf about two hundred and sixty miles. Often ships driven by the north wind strike it. Travelers guard against it; if they go east of it, they are saved, but if they enter the gulf southward, they maneuver to exit via the south wind so that the waters and winds do not carry them to the Mountain of Regret and they perish. The settlements of al-Qamar in the south of this part are connected with the mountain attributed to them. Located in it are cities: The Island of al-Qamar (Madagascar/Comoros), long and wide, said to be four months in length and the wide part over twenty days. Layranah, Ibn Fatimah mentioned that he entered it and it belongs to Muslims like Mogadishu. Its people are gathered from various regions. It is a place of landing and takeoff. Its sheikhs who manage it flatter the ruler of the city of Malay to their east. Layranah is on the sea where longitude is one hundred and two degrees minus minutes, and latitude half a degree and two minutes. It is on a large inlet descending in Part Seven to its west. Fifty degrees from it is Malay, where a king of the kings of the island resides. He may be a sultan controlling the entire island or most of it, but that is rare due to the distances and the dispersion of opinions and sects. It is at the latitude of Layranah, and to its west is an inlet descending from the great river flowing down to Layranah.",

    "text": "Part Seven: In it ends the land of Sudan, connected from the far West to the Mountain of Regret, then the sea becomes inhabited due to what is in its east along the length of the Island of al-Qamar. The beginning of the Mountain of Regret is the start of this part, where longitude is one hundred and eighty degrees and a minute. It is said its height in the air is about three days, and it is mixed with dust color and redness. It extends with the beginning of habitation where latitude is sixteen degrees for about twenty days. About fourteen days of it are along the sea. Its end is where longitude is one hundred and seventeen and a half degrees. The Surrounding Ocean entering from the East and South strikes its southern corner, and to its north is the Gulf of al-Qamar. If a ship slips from the Indian Ocean and enters this gulf, and the waters and winds carry it until this mountain is seen, one regrets what they neglected in terms of caution and surrenders to fate; either breaking upon it or entering behind it, never to be heard of again nor knowing what happened to them. It is said there are whirlpools there that keep spinning the ship until it sinks. Travelers in the Indian Ocean call that place the Sea of Ruin and the Sea of Suhail (Canopus), because if they reach it, they see Suhail directly overhead. Below this mountain to its north on the Gulf of al-Qamar is the city of Daghutah, the last city of Sofala and the last habitation on the land connected to this sea. It is where longitude is one hundred and nine degrees and latitude twelve degrees. It has an inlet to its north into which a river descends from the Moon Mountain. It is said its source shares the source of the river of Sayuna. In this Seventh Part, among the cities of the Island of al-Qamar which are capitals for its kings, lies Dahmi. It is where longitude is one hundred and twelve and a half degrees and latitude three degrees. An inlet descends to its east, its substance from the Great River, and it curves entering the sea from it until it almost touches the Equator, until at the end of the arc is the city of Balbaq, also a capital of the island's kings. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and eighteen and a half degrees and latitude one degree. East of it is an island attributed to this city, its length about two degrees from west to east and its width nearing a degree. East of Balbaq is the great arced river, the river of Layranah, descending from the Mountain of Springs, a mountain eight stages long from west to east. Five small rivers descend from its springs to the arc of this great river, so it curves and pours into the river of Layranah and the sea of Balbaq. East of Balbaq is the island of Serendib (Ceylon/Sri Lanka), half in this part and the other half in the Eighth. Its southern half is behind the Equator and its northern half in the First Clime. It is famous. The location of its city where its king resides is where longitude is one hundred and twenty-four degrees and latitude one and a half degrees and minutes; its name is Aghna. It has other cities. Splitting it in half at the Equator is the great mountain named al-Rahun (Adam's Peak), which is very high. It is said Adam, peace be upon him, descended upon it from Paradise. In its ravines and valleys, precious types of ruby (yaqut) and diamond stone used to drill ruby are found. In its sea is a famous pearl fishery. It is circular in shape. It is said to be eighty farsakhs by the same. Indian spices are plentiful there. On the arc of its southern sea are the famous inlets (Aghbab) of Serendib towards the South. They are four carved ones; into each inlet pours one of the rivers of the Island of al-Qamar. The western inlet is in Part Seven, the next along the line of Part Eight, then the fourth from the end of the mentioned arc. Part Eight: The first capital of the Island of al-Qamar you encounter is the city of Khafura. It is where longitude is one hundred and thirty degrees and latitude one degree on the last bay to the east of the inlets of Serendib. The Greatest River descending from the mountain overlooking Qumari pours into its north. East of it is the capital Dimli, on the sea where longitude is one hundred and forty-three degrees and latitude half a degree. A river descends into its east from the Greatest River. In this part are two mountains; one south of Dimli from which a long river exits to the third inlet, and the other near the middle of the distance between the two capitals near the southern sea, from which three small rivers exit pouring into this long river.",

    "text": "Part Nine: Contains cities and settlements of the Island of al-Qamar that are not famous. The mentioned one is the ancient capital of the island, whose ruler may sometimes dominate most of it, which is Qamariyah. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and fifty-four degrees, on a great bay rising three degrees from the Equator and widening about that much. This city is attributed to the Qamar (people), who are the sons of Amur bin Japheth, sharing lineage with the Amur of China. They used to live with the Chinese in the eastern parts of the earth, then discord arose, and the Chinese expelled them to the islands. They remained there for a while, and the title of their king was Qamarun. Then discord arose in that island which will be mentioned, so those distant from power left for this Great Island, and their authority was in the city of Qamariyah. Then they multiplied and branched out into the mentioned capitals and became factions and kings of regions. Then they fought when they multiplied, and a great multitude left them and inhabited the South at the beginning of habitation along the length of the mountain attributed to them. Those who do not know call it the Mountain of the Moon (Qamar) with a vowel 'a' on the Qaf. In this large island, whose length is four months and the width of its widest part twenty days, are great rivers. The greatest is the River of Khafura. Due to its depth and width, large sea ships travel in it for cargo. Its length between its mouth and the eastern end of the island—and its mouth is below Khafura—is about two months. On its banks are large trees; from a single tree, they make the ship you know, rowed by a hundred men. It is hollowed out, and the table at which a hundred people sit. That is mentioned in books and famous on tongues. From this wood, they make houses on ships and anchor them with ropes. If one of them dislikes his neighbor, he moves to another neighbor. Likewise, if fire breaks out in his neighbor's house, he unties his house's ropes and escapes. In it is the great bird known as the Roc (Rukh); they claimed it covers a military detachment with its shadow and snatches elephant chicks with its talons to feed its young. They make bridges from its quills over their waters to cross, and from its hollow bases, water jars. They have cows they use for pulling; one calf is the size of three of our land's cows. Each of its horns holds a thousand \"Mann\" of oil. Their oil for lighting comes from the fat of great beasts they hunt in their sea. They have hemp (Hashish) from which they weave fine colored textiles brought to Iraq and Yemen. It has bananas, sugar, and coconuts from which they make ropes for their ships and stitch their planks. Most of what grows there is the Betel (Tanbul), which is like grapevines in its twisting and like laurel in its leaves. They use a leaf of it with a little lime and water, producing a good mood, intoxication, and fragrance they enjoy; it is the wine of the lands of India. Their appearances are more inclined to the Chinese than the Indians, as are their clothes and their worship of idols (Buddhas/Abdad) like the people of India and China. At the head of the city of Qamariyah, the mountain attributed to it rises about three degrees. Many rivers descend from it to the great River of Khafura. Its eastern tip pours into the end of the island from the east side, and its western tip below Khafura. The sea that passes along its southern length mixes from the South with the Surrounding Ocean. It is said no one enters it, neither from the islanders nor others. Whoever falls into it perishes in its whirlpools. Their travel is only in the Northern Indian Ocean and the seas of the eastern and western directions.",

    "text": "Part Ten: In it is the Island of al-Mujah (likely Muja/Ma-iTsu), its length from South to North is twelve days. Its location is at the beginning of the part, its width about two days, and its southern head is at the end of habitation. Its city is where longitude is one hundred and sixty-three degrees and latitude nine degrees. It is an independent kingdom. To its north is the Island of al-Mayd, separated by a strait half a degree wide. It is smaller than the first, counted among the islands of China mentioned in books. Around it are small islands called the Islands of al-Shamsiyah (Solar/Sun); their people are among the filthiest of God's creation, and they bring honey and wax to China. There ends the Indian Ocean and mixes with the Surrounding Ocean where longitude is one hundred and thirty-four degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude twelve degrees thirty minutes behind the Equator, according to what is reported from Ptolemy. The city of al-Mayd is where longitude is one hundred and sixty-three degrees and a minute and latitude four degrees. Travelers used to aim for it in ancient times, then diverted from it to the Island of Java. At the mixing of the two seas is the mouth of Khamdan, the greatest river of China. On its east and west in this part is the city of Khamdan, one of the most famous cities of China behind the Equator. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and sixty-eight degrees and latitude one degree. On its west is the city of Qaytaghur, one of the famous cities of China, its latitude behind the Equator is six degrees. Khamdan is two degrees longer (in longitude). China has settlements and cities east of this center, but they are not famous. At the mixing of the Indian Ocean with the Surrounding Ocean, an arm takes from it to the South. Separating it from the Ocean is the Great Mountain of Clouds (Jabal al-Sahab), a mountain constantly covered by clouds due to its height. It is said it was named so because black clouds emerge from the Island of Clouds beneath it, stirring up the sea with their winds and drowning what is upon it. The sea in this place at the end of Part Ten seems separate from the Indian Ocean and the Surrounding Ocean and is called the Sea of Waq Waq. In it are islands; first is the Island of Clouds, between its northern tip and the Equator is about five degrees. South of it is the Island of al-Dajjal (Antichrist), its length towards the South. The Island of Waq Waq is at the end of habitation of this island towards the East. Separating its sea from the Surrounding Ocean is the Mountain of the Big Head (Jabal al-Ras al-Kabir), which is large. Al-Masudi recounted that in it are trees from which grows a plant like the Abranj (?) and girls are born from it hanging by their hair. One of them cries \"Waq Waq\"; if their hair is cut and they are separated from the tree, they die. It is said gold is abundant in this island. These islands surround the Mountain of Conquest (Jabal al-Fath), inhabited by deformed blacks who cut off the road for people and eat them. None of the neighbors enter the islands of this sea. Talk about its inhabitants and the Island of al-Dajjal is like fables, so Glory be to the Creator. First Clime: Its inhabitants are black (Sudan). Its latitude is sixteen degrees and twenty-seven minutes. It consists of ten parts:",

    "text": "Part One: In it appears the Surrounding Ocean (Atlantic) as reported from Ptolemy where longitude is one degree and latitude ten minutes. From there are the Eternal Islands (Canary Islands) in the seas depicted in geography. They are six, occupying the entire latitudinal strip of the First Clime and a little of the Second. From these islands, Ptolemy took longitudes, just as he took latitudes from the Equator. They are not inhabited, but Alexander the Two-Horned (Dhul-Qarnayn) reached them and attempted to travel across (their sea) but could not achieve what he wanted, either due to vortices and thick fog or fear of getting lost and perishing in nothingness. Then he placed a lighthouse on each island to guide those who are lost and wrote on each one: No passage behind me. There is much to say about them. Ibn Fatimah said: The Islands of Happiness (Fortunate Isles) are between the Eternal Islands and the mainland, scattered in the First, Second, and Third Climes. They are twenty-four islands. Talk about them is like myths. The Surrounding Ocean gradually rises in this part until the mouth of the Nile that passes through Ghana is located where longitude is ten degrees twenty minutes and latitude fourteen degrees. In front of the Nile mouth in the Surrounding Ocean is the Island of Salt; its length from North to South is two degrees and a little, and its width half a degree. At its southern tip on the sea is the city of Awlil, which is free/open like the cities of the Indians, containing many types of reeds and plants. Its people live on fish and turtles, and their trade is salt; they go up with it in boats to the lands on the banks of the Nile. They said there is no salt pan in the lands of Sudan other than it. Next to this island is the Island of Ambergris; between them is a strait measuring half a degree. Between it and the mainland is less than that. Its length is two degrees and its width at the top three degrees. It is also called the Island of Turtles since there are many of them. The people of those lands hunt them, dry their meat, and travel with it. They also find much ambergris in this island. The first thing you encounter on the west of the Nile from the cities of Takrur is the city of Qalanbu, a famous port. In the time of Abu Ubayd al-Bakri, it belonged to the disbelievers. As for our time, no city on the bank of the Nile in the land of Takrur remains except that Islam has entered it, and all belong to the Sultan of Takrur. Its capital is on both sides of the Nile and is named Takrur, by which they are known. Their lineage is called Maghzawa. They are two sections: a section that became urbanized and inhabits cities, and a section roaming in the deserts. Most of their domains are on the northern side of the Nile, and they have little in the south; most of it is the domains of Lamlam, who are neglected disbelievers who eat people. The location of the city of Takrur is where longitude is seventeen degrees and latitude thirteen and a half degrees and minutes. Its ruler captures slaves from Lamlam, who are nomads. They have a city in books like a village called Muyah, containing the house of their Dakakir, which are idols, situated on the Surrounding Ocean where latitude is six degrees.",

    "text": "Part Two of the First Clime: The first thing you meet in it is the city of Barisa, one of the most famous lands of Takrur. If the authority of Takrur weakens, the ruler of Barisa becomes independent. Travelers frequent it. It is the last of the cities of Takrur on the north of the Nile, where longitude is twenty-two degrees and latitude three and a half degrees. The predominant clothing of the Takrur blacks and others is skins. If one of them is modest, the skin is tanned. Those who mix with Whites and specialize adopt clothing of wool and cotton, which is imported for them. Their predominant food is pulses (qataniya) and unfermented porridges. Bread is not found among them except as a novelty with kings who adopt the manners of Whites. Their horses are short and not fast. Their weapons are ebony clubs—ebony is plentiful on the Nile and used for firewood—and they have bows and arrows made of thorny reeds from which they make bowstrings. In their lands is the cotton tree. No one builds with gypsum and brick except a king or one permitted by him among the wealthy and elite. Their nomads are naked. The Muslims among them cover their private parts with bones or skins, while the disbelievers do not cover themselves. East and north of Barisa, the Lami River pours in, descending from the mountains south of the city of Lami. This city is like a village under the obedience of the disbelievers of Lamlam. Its people are Jews; their race is known in slavery in the Maghreb. The Lami Mountain extends from west to east for eight stages. From its western end, the mentioned Lami River exits, passing through their settlements until it pours into the Nile. From its eastern end, the Malal River exits and curves to pass the city of Malal, one of the cities of the neglected disbelievers. The latitude of the city of Lami is ten degrees, and its longitude aligns with the longitude of Barisa. The longitude of Malal is twenty-six degrees. Its river pours into the Nile from the direction of the city of Dirham, a city of the neglected disbelievers, located in the middle of the distance between Lami and Malal. East of what was mentioned is the River \"al-Hu\", one of the rivers mentioned by Ptolemy, descending from Mount al-Hu, which extends behind the Equator. The head of this mountain is where longitude is thirty-two degrees and latitude nine degrees behind the Line. It extends from there crossing the Line by two degrees and minutes. A branch exits from it with the Line, two degrees long. From its western head, the mentioned river exits, twisting north like the letter Nun (ن), then descends to the Nile where longitude at the city of Malal is two and a half degrees. On the banks of this river from its source to near its mouth are the domains of Namnam, brothers of Lamlam in lineage and similar in actions. East of it by miles is Mount Samaqdi, large and overlooking, containing drugs and plants beneficial to those lands. A multitude of neglected disbelieving blacks known as Samaqdi take refuge in it, and the city of Samaqdi is known by them. It is at the peak of this mountain where longitude is thirty degrees and latitude eight degrees. The city of Ghana on the banks of the Nile is located in that part where longitude is twenty-nine degrees and latitude ten degrees fifteen minutes. In it resides the Sultan of Ghana, a descendant of Al-Hussein bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them. He has a large [...] containing a hole where he ties his horse, boasting of that over other kings of Sudan. He wages much jihad against the disbelievers, and his house is known for that. East of the city of Samaqdi is the Island of Gold (Jazirat al-Tibr). Its western head is where longitude is thirty-one degrees, and its eastern head is where longitude is thirty-six and a half degrees. Its center in latitude aligns with Ghana, and its position is two degrees. In this island, they find much gold dust (Tibr) glittering at night when the excess waters recede from its sand. On this island are famous cities, including the city of Samgharah. On this northern arm at the end of this part is the most famous city of gold in this part after Ghana, which is Ghiyaru. It is on a bay exiting from the south of the island's Nile where longitude is thirty-four degrees and latitude fifteen degrees. South of the Nile of Ghana are the previously mentioned domains of Namnam, and north of it are the domains of Wangara (Wanqarah), who are the blacks of the land, and Islam has spread among them.",

    "text": "Part Three of the First Clime: The first thing you encounter is Mount Thala. Its southern head is in Lake Kuri (Lake Chad) from which the Nile exits, and from its northern head the Nile of Ghana exits. To its east is the land of Kawkaw (Gao), named after the city of the land's ruler. He is one of the disbelieving Sudan. Mount Kawkaw is proverbial. It faces the Muslims of Ghana from its west and the Muslims of Kanem from its east. The city of Kawkaw is east of the river attributed to it, where longitude is forty-four degrees and latitude ten degrees fifteen minutes. The source of the river of Kawkaw, branching west from the Nile, is from Mount Maquris (?). It is one of the mountains mentioned by Ptolemy; its northern limit is where longitude is forty-three degrees thirty-five minutes, and the latitude exits from the First Clime to the Second. It connects to Mount Badi, which connects to Lake Kuri from which the Nile exits. It has been said that the river of Kawkaw draws its substance from Lake Kuri, and that much water sinks from it into this mountain, then the river of Kawkaw exits from it north of it, aligning with the Nile of Ghana until it sinks into sands in the Second Part aligning with the middle of the Island of Gold. On its two banks are the domains of Kawkaw, who are naked and neglected. At its western end are the domains of Na'amah, black Berbers of the Kawkaw type. Between Kawkaw and the city of Badi, from whose south the Nile of Ghana exits, and Kawkaw are four degrees. Its exit is from where longitude is forty-eight degrees and latitude six and a half degrees. Ibn Fatimah said: Thus, the distance of its flow from Lake Kuri to the Surrounding Ocean, according to its meanderings, is about three thousand miles. In this Third Part is Lake Kuri, from which the Nile of Egypt, the Nile of Mogadishu, and the Nile of Ghana exit. The descent of the lake rivers to it at the touching of the Equator has been mentioned. Its ascent above the Line revolves around half a degree, increasing or decreasing slightly. Its length is a thousand miles. Its eastern head is where longitude is fifty-one degrees, and its western end is with the line of the Third Part. Its width at the head is nine and a half degrees, then it proceeds gradually as drawn until the width of its middle is four hundred and fifty miles, and the width of its tail is three hundred and sixty miles.",

    "text": "Ibn Fatimah said: I have not seen anyone who saw its (south) side; rather, the Kanemites and their neighbors whom we met on the northern side described it. It is surrounded on all sides by tyrannical nations of disbelieving Sudan who eat people, and no religion reminds them of the inhabitants of the northern side. Among them is Badi. Their city is known by them, and from beneath it exits the Nile of Ghana. Their city is around it. Neighboring it from the western side are the Jabi, who file their teeth. If one of them dies, they give him to their neighbors (to eat), and their neighbors do the same with them. On the south of the lake are the Ankarar, and on its east are the Kuri, to whom the lake is attributed. East of the city of Badi, belonging to the Muslim Kanem, is the city of Jajah. It is the seat of a separate kingdom with cities and lands, currently belonging to the Sultan of Kanem. It is described as fertile with abundant goods, containing peacocks, parrots, spotted chickens, and piebald sheep the size of small donkeys with forms different from our rams. Giraffes are plentiful in the land of Jajah. East of its city, on the corner of the lake, is al-Maghza (The Place of Raid?), where the arsenal of Kanem is located. He often raids from there in his fleet the lands of the disbelievers on the sides of this lake, intercepting their boats, killing and taking captives. The location of the city of Jajah is where longitude is forty-eight degrees twenty minutes and latitude seven degrees, aligned with the corner of the lake where longitude is fifty-one degrees. Among the famous cities of Kanem is Manan, latitude thirteen degrees. East and south of it is the capital of Kanem, Jimi, where longitude is fifty-three degrees and nine minutes. In it is the Sultan of Kanem, famous for Jihad and charitable acts, Muhammadi, a descendant of Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan. The capital of his disbelieving ancestors before they converted was the city of Manan. Then his fourth grandfather converted at the hands of Islamic jurists in the land of Kanem. This Sultan has there the likes of the Sultanate of Tajuh, the Kingdom of Kawar, and the Kingdom of Fezzan. God has supported him and increased his offspring and armies. Clothes are brought to him from the Tunisian capital. He has jurists with him. In the direction of Jimi at the end of this part, he has al-Rudayni, containing Sabin belonging to him and Samtanzah. It is on the west of the Nile coming to Egypt. Between it and Jimi is forty miles. Their fruits do not resemble our fruits; pomegranates and peaches are found abundantly among them. They have cultivated sugar cane, which grew slightly well there, but only the Sultan exploits it, as well as grapes and wheat. The exit of the Egyptian Nile in this part is from Lake Kuri where longitude is fifty-one degrees and latitude six degrees. At its outburst from the lake is the city of Kuri belonging to the Sudan who eat people, located north of it. Its width is at Mount Maqsim extending from the first southeastern corner of the lake. From under this mountain also exits the Nile of Mogadishu near the Equator and from behind the Line. They mentioned that in Lake Kuri is Mount Luratus, located in this Third Part. Ptolemy mentioned that it begins where longitude is forty-three degrees and latitude three degrees twenty minutes, and ends where longitude is thirty-eight degrees forty-five minutes and latitude one. It is also called the Mountain of Gold. The Sudan claim that the gold found in the lands of the Nile during its flood is from the mines of this mountain. No one can approach it due to the abundance of snakes and deadly beasts. Its coastal sides are full of crocodiles and hippopotamuses (horses of the Nile). It is said that the hippopotamus is not hunted in this lake, but rather in the Nile of Ghana and the Nile of Nubia. East of Mount Maquris, separating Kanem and Kawkaw, are the domains of Kanem and their followers among the Berbers who converted at the hands of the Sultan of Kanem. They are his slaves; he raids with them and benefits from their camels that filled those regions in the domains of Manan. East of Manan are the domains of the Zaghawa, mostly Muslims under the obedience of the Kanemi. North of Manan and the domains of Kanem are the domains of the Kawar. Their famous city is located in the Third Clime; they are Muslims under the obedience of the Kanemi.",

    "text": "Part Four of the First Clime: The Western Nile passes from its beginning for three degrees in the land of Bantah, who are black disbelievers separating Kanem and Nubia. Then it dives into the sands where the latitude is nine degrees. It passes underground, according to their claim, winding from South to North, appearing only where longitude is fifty-eight degrees and latitude eleven degrees. It curves like a bow with its back to the East. To its west lies the capital of Nubia, Dongola (Dunqulah), where longitude is fifty-eight degrees and minutes and latitude four degrees fifteen minutes. South of it, among the cities of Nubia, is Nuwabah, after which they are named. It is where longitude is fifty-eight degrees thirty minutes and latitude nine degrees. South and west of it are the domains of the Zanj of Nubia whose capital is Kushah behind the Line. The Nubians are Christians. West and north of Dongola, among their cities mentioned in books, is Alwa, located east and north of the Nile. Between it and Dongola is one hundred and seventy miles, where longitude is fifty-seven degrees and latitude sixteen degrees minus minutes. West of Alwa, the Nile bends greatly, returning to the West until it enters the Third Part from which it exited, ending at half a degree, then descends from there to the Second Clime. On its banks are settlements of Nubia. Between its southern east and Tajuh, the capital of the Zaghawa, is one hundred miles. The location of this city is where longitude is fifty-five degrees and latitude fourteen degrees. Its people have converted to Islam and entered the obedience of the Kanemi. South of it is the city of Zaghawa where longitude is fifty-four degrees and latitude eleven and a half degrees. The domains of the Tajuh and Zaghawa extend in the distance between the arc of the Nile from South to North. They are one race, but sovereignty, good appearance, and morals are with the Tajuh. They are disbelievers rebellious against the Kanemi, frequenting the deserts and mountains in the First and Second Climes. Ibn Fatimah mentioned that the kings of Kanem and Tajuh fled with their capitals away from the Nile only because of mosquitoes, for they abound near the Nile and their harm is severe on humans and horses. They have springs in the sands and waters drawn from the Nile during the days of flood.",

    "text": "In this Fourth Part, among the cities of Abyssinia (Habasha) mentioned in books is Hanbiyah, where longitude is fifty-eight degrees and latitude three degrees. East of it is the land of Kazlah. They are famous in the lands of Abyssinia, and their race is desired. The Abyssinians generally are the best race of the Sudan, and the eunuchs of kings and notables are from them. They are Christians, and among them on the coast are Muslims. The land of Kazlah is from the beginning of the Equator neighboring the Zanj of Abyssinia to the south of Mount Muris, from whose gold and silver mines they claimed the people of Hanbiyah and those regions live. It is four days from Hanbiyah. In its east and north, it starts from there and passes eastward deviating to the North until it cuts the Nile of Abyssinia and ends at their sea. East and south of Kazlah is Lake Hawaras, attributed to a nation of Abyssinian Zanj, naked and wild. It is said gold and tin (Raṣāṣ Qal'ī) are plentiful in their land. Ibn Fatimah said: It is reported from Ptolemy that the center of this lake is on the Equator where longitude is sixty-two degrees and its radius from every side to the center is two degrees. The Nile of Abyssinia exits from it, resembling the Nile of Egypt in its increase during the days of river deficiency and in the presence of crocodiles and hippopotamuses. That is where longitude is sixty-one degrees and latitude two degrees. On its east next to the lake, among their cities mentioned in books, is al-Naja'ah. It passes to the North, so upon it where longitude is sixty-two degrees and latitude six degrees is Maraqatah. North of it is the Mountain of Mines previously mentioned. The city is east of the Nile. North of the mountain is the land of its sorcerers from the Abyssinian races mentioned, and their settlements extend along this Nile on both sides. East of it, among the famous cities of Abyssinia, is Kalghur. It is a gathering place for them from every direction, and a meeting point for those wanting the sea, the Nile, or the wilderness. Its location is where longitude is sixty-three and latitude eleven degrees. North of its sorcerers from the Nile to the sea is the land of Khasah. They are disparaged among the Abyssinian races. It is famous about them that they castrate whoever falls into their hands and give human males as their dowries, boasting of that. East of them to the sea is Samhar, a land where the long Samhari spears (Qana) are found. A strange thing about them is that if they rub against each other, fire sparks from them, burning all or a group of them depending on proximity and wind assistance. Gazelles are plentiful in the land of Samhar. From their skins, they strap onto horses instead of saddles and ride them. Their fighting is with the mentioned Samhari spears, and they are skilled in stabbing and playing with them. They claim that people like Turks, white with hair, reach them from the South and fight them. If this is true, the climes in the South are connected like the climes in the North; discussion on that is lengthy. In their land is the rhinoceros (Karkadann); it has two horns on its forehead, one longer than the other. It is a harmful animal hunted by a horseman running behind it and striking its legs with a sword so it falls. If he does not guard against it, the rhinoceros falls on him and kills him with his horse. They eat its meat. Also on their Nile are lions and elephants. East of Kalghur with a deviation to the North is the city of Najbah, to which the Najibiyah camels are attributed. That is where longitude is sixty-five degrees and latitude twelve degrees. West of it is Mount Khamahin; this stone is found there. It was precious to the Persians; they made seals from it and medicated with water if rubbed in it due to the heat of the Khamahin. It is called mineral sandalwood and enters the category of sandalwood in treating hot ailments. The length of this mountain is one hundred miles from South to North with a curve as it passes north to the East. The first city of Abyssinia you encounter on the Indian Ocean from its western coast, bordering the land of Berbera mentioned before, behind the Equator, is the city of Bata. It is famous on the tongues of Abyssinians in our lands. It is two degrees from the Line, and its longitude is sixty-four and a half degrees. North of it, among their cities at one hundred miles, is Baqsali on a bay entering the West about fifty miles. North of it is Manqubah, which is the mountain of the continuous inlet to the East where longitude is sixty-five degrees and latitude eight degrees thirty minutes. At its two ends, Mount Maquris enters the sea. North of it, among the famous cities of Abyssinia, is the land of Zayla (Zeila). Its people are Muslims who frequent Hajj and travel to the coast of Aden and Zabid. It is a place of landing and takeoff. From it, Abyssinian slaves are distributed to the coastal Islamic lands. Its location is on a corner of the sea where the latitude of its western and northern ends terminates, where longitude is sixty-six degrees and latitude eleven degrees minus minutes. Mentioned in books among the islands of this sea near the coast is the Island of Qanbalu. Between it and Baqsali is two and a half degrees.",

    "text": "Its southern tip is aligned with it, and its length is close to its width, about two degrees. Between its northeastern corner and Aden is four and a half degrees. It was inhabited but is now a ruin where ships that take precaution shelter, needing water and firewood. It was mentioned that the end of the Indian Ocean where the mentioned Abyssinian cities are located is entirely, near the coasts, connected reefs over which water splashes up to Bab al-Mandab. Only small boats travel there, and perhaps winds overcome them and break them on those rocks. The width of the tail of the Indian Ocean from Bab al-Mandab to Berbera is eight courses (Majra). Mount Mandab is the separator between the Great Indian Ocean and the Sea of Qulzum (Red Sea) which exits from it. It is small, extending twelve miles from East to West with a deviation to the North. The sea narrows there so a man can see his companion on the other shore. They say it is the measure of two hundred arrows. Travelers call this place Bab al-Mandab, estimating its length with the mountain. It is located where longitude is sixty-eight and a half degrees and latitude eleven degrees and minutes. Ships must pass through it entering and exiting. Some travelers recounted that a large ship took precaution in the fog early in the morning and exited west of Mount Mandab between those reefs, so God saved it, and its safety was considered a rare tale. The Sea of Qulzum, from south to north, when leaving Bab al-Mandab, begins to increase in width slightly, until its width at 'Awan—between it and Tihama of Yemen—is about sixty miles. It is where longitude is sixty-eight degrees and latitude thirteen and a half degrees. It is famous, and its inhabitants are Muslim Abyssinians. It has piebald cows of preserved lineage belonging to its owner, and they patrol on them out of jealousy. If the weather is clear, al-Janah appears from it, a high mountain in the sea. From there to the Island of Dahlak are small islands belonging to the ruler of Yemen and the ruler of Dahlak. The largest and most famous of these islands is Kamaran Island. It is inhabited, belonging to the ruler of Yemen at the end of Part Four in terms of latitude, closer to the mainland of Zabid. East and north of 'Awan on the coast of Yemen in this part, among the famous ports, is Ghalafiqah, the port of Zabid; between them is forty miles. The location of Zabid, the capital of Tihama of Yemen, is where longitude is sixty-seven degrees forty minutes and latitude fifteen and a half degrees. Between Bab al-Mandab and the city of Aden, the famous port of Yemen in the East and West, is three stages of plain and mountain. It is east of it where longitude is seventy degrees and latitude twelve degrees. The sea gradually enters south from Bab al-Mandab to Aden. An inlet enters from its west surrounding much of it so it remains like an island. Ships from Berbera and ships fearing the storm anchor there, but not large ones, as Aden's anchorage is not safe when the sea rages. Mountains extend from its north, and among them lies the ancient capital of Yemen, Sana'a. That is east and north of Aden, where longitude is seventy-one and a half degrees and latitude fourteen and a half degrees. Between it and Aden is the city of Jibla, built by the Sulayhids, the callers of the Ubaydi (Fatimid) mission in Yemen. It is on two rivers; one descends from Mount al-Mudaykhirah, the high mountain north of Sana'a, passes its west and south, then passes its mountain, mixes with the other river, and they pour into the east of Abyan, a famous small town between it and Aden, two small stages. In the mentioned mountains, Yemeni agate (Carnelian), Wars plant, and Cassia fistula are found. On the mountains extending from South to North in this part lies al-Dumluwah, proverbial for its impregnability and fortification; it is north of Aden. North of al-Dumluwah lies al-Juwa, a famous small town on the main mountain road. Al-Mansur ibn Rasul, ruler of Yemen, often stayed there and built a garden and royal buildings. North of it, where longitude is seventy and latitude fourteen and a half degrees, lies Ta'izz, the capital of Yemen in later times. At the top of its mountain is the stronghold that cannot be aspired to, named Sabir. A small stage north of it is al-Janad, famous for unhealthiness (Wakham); no stranger drinks its water without perishing. In its mountains are many monkeys. Part Five of the First Clime:",

    "text": "The first thing you encounter in it are the mountains of Hadramawt, extending from North to South. They have cities of obscure names because they have little luck/prosperity, and riders do not frequent them on land nor ship owners at sea. Its most famous coastal city in books is Las'a, where longitude is seventy-two degrees ten minutes and latitude twelve degrees; between them is forty miles. Between Las'a and Aden is an extended transverse mountain lengthening travel on land; its distance from the sea to the north of Las'a is eighty miles. The capital of Hadramawt is Tarim, in the mountains north of Las'a; between them is ninety miles. North of Tarim, among its cities mentioned in books, is Shanwah, noted for abundant dates; between them is about ninety miles. Sixty miles east of each is al-Khuzaymah. In the East is Zafar, which was the capital of the Tubba's (Himyarite kings), then fell into ruin. It is where longitude is seventy-three degrees and latitude fifteen degrees. Then on the coast, among the cities of al-Shihr—the land of Ambergris and Frankincense—you meet the city of Mirbat. It is on a bay entering North so this city is at longitude seventy-four degrees and latitude fourteen and a half degrees. East of it on the mentioned bay is the modern Zafar (Dhofar), now the capital of the land of al-Shihr and its famous port. Horses of Arabia are brought to it and from it carried to the land of India. Its ruler, Ibn al-Nahun, has taxes on them. It is said that in the land of this city are many Indian drugs like coconut, betel, betel nut, and Amba (Mango), which is like melon with different tastes found in it. The wasteland between it and Qalhat is not traversed due to emptiness and predatory leopards. This large bay is called the Bay of Hashish (Grass); it enters the land from the sea limit about one hundred miles and extends from west to east about three hundred miles. Ships do not exit it except with a land wind. Travelers from India to Aden often fear falling into it. North of this bay are the sands of al-Ahqaf. There lies the grave of Hud, peace be upon him. North of these sands and cities are the Frankincense Mountains extending from West to East. There is no famous city there; rather, its inhabitants are people from Mahra, like wild beasts in appearance and speech. The Mahri camels are attributed to them. They feed them small fish coming out of their sea called al-Wazaf. Inside this part are Martan and Hartan, two islands. The first is the eastern one, inhabited by people speaking the language of 'Ad. South of it is Socotra, a famous island to which the preferred Socotran Aloe is attributed. It is slanted from South to North eastward, its length about one hundred and eighty miles. Between it and al-Ahqaf is about two hundred miles. Its inhabitants are Christians from the remnants of the Greeks who commit piracy at sea on ships. In it is a spring of water said to increase intellect. At the end of the Bay of Hashish to the East is the great high mountain known in books as the Head of the Skull (Ras al-Jumjumah). That place is also known as Ghubb al-Qamar. Ships of Mogadishu aim for this Head and guide themselves by it, as do others. It is said there is also a round mountain there in the shape of the moon below this great mountain. This bay, the mountain enters from it into the sea about one hundred miles and likewise into the land. At its tip are two branches for which sailors call it the Two-Horned (Dhul-Qarnayn). East of the Western Peninsula there is no habitation or mentioned place until you meet in the beginning of Oman its current capital, Qalhat. Its location is where longitude is ninety-nine degrees sixty minutes, and latitude is at the end of the First Clime. In this sea lie the Islands of al-Mand, known for abundant coconut. The greatest is the Island of Kilwa (Kilwa Kisiwani); this is how travelers know it now. They are many islands mentioned by Ptolemy who called them the Island of al-Mand. They are brothers of Hind and Sindh, but were not granted the luck of fame as Hind and Sindh were. Ibn Fatimah mentioned that the Zanj overcame them and drove many of them out to the mainland of Sindh, keeping the rest as subjects.",

In the southeast side is the city of al-Mand, and in the northwest is the city of Kank. The circumference of the island is one thousand four hundred miles. It approximates a square shape and has inlets from the sea. West of it are small islands of obscure names. Among its islands mentioned in books is the Island of al-Qatrabah west of it; its length from West to East is one hundred and sixty miles and its width about sixty miles. Its people are a nation on the route to India and the Persian Sea route who constantly intercept ships. The sea between it and the Island of Kilwa is a course and a third. South of it is the Island of Monkeys; it is round with mountains and ravines overrun by monkeys. The people of the neighboring island use tricks to hunt them and carry them to lands to sell. Below this island about one hundred and sixty miles, at the southwest corner of Kilwa Island, between it and the sea is about two courses. South of it, among the islands of Kilwa, is the Island of Karmadah; its circumference is about three hundred and thirty miles. Its people are black pirates with their ships. East of it is the Island of the Volcano (al-Burkan); in it is a mountain where fire never ceases burning at night and smoke rises by day, like the volcano of Sicily. Its inhabitants are Zanj, and its circumference is about three hundred miles. Following these islands adjacent to Kilwa are the Islands of al-Zanij (Zabaj/Zanj?), famous on the tongues of travelers. The greatest is the Island of Sarbazah (Srivijaya/Sumatra?); its length from North to South is four hundred miles, and its width at each end, South and North, is about one hundred and sixty miles. It has inlets from the sea. Its city Sarbazah is in its center; a bay from the sea enters it, and it is on a river. Its location is where longitude is eighty-eight and a half degrees and latitude three degrees forty minutes. It has other unmentioned cities. After the Islands of al-Zabaj is the Island of Anfujah. Its ruler has equipment and numbers with which he dominates most times and seizes the Islands of al-Zabaj because of it. In the southern side is the city of Anjabah. Al-Bayhaqi said: \"Most of the livelihood of the people of these islands is from bananas.\" The length of the Island of Anfujah is about one hundred and seventy miles and its width revolves around ninety miles. The width of the strait between it and the Island of Sarbazah is half a course. South and east of Sarbazah are countless small islands of al-Zabaj. Most are inhabited by blacks. Few of these islands fall into this Fifth Part. At its end is the Equator, and the Dome of Arin (Uzin), previously mentioned. Part Six: All of it is sea containing the Diba Islands (Maldives/Laccadives). They are many, the largest being the Island of Duwaybi, known by that on the tongues of travelers. Its city is where longitude is ninety-two degrees and latitude fifteen degrees twenty minutes. The length of the island from West to East is two hundred and twenty miles. Its width revolves around one hundred and forty miles. Most inhabitants of this island are descendants of Arabs; they are Muslims. Travelers to India land with them and buy sugar cane from them. Most of their cane is black in color. Some of these islands fall into the Second Clime. Most of the large island falls into it. Between it and the mainland of Sindh is about a course and a half. Part Seven: Most of it contains the Coconut Islands counted as part of the work of Serendib. They are many, and none are mentioned in books except the Island of Balq. It was mentioned behind the Line, just as the Island of Serendib was mentioned sharing between what is south of the Equator and north of it. Located on the northern coast of this part, among the cities of India famous on the tongues of travelers, is Somnath. It is from the lands of Gujarat, also known as the lands of al-Lar. Its location is in an inlet in the sea, so ships from Aden land there often because it is not in a bay (shallow/dangerous). It has a large bay whose substance descends from the large mountain north of it to its east. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and twenty degrees and latitude fifteen degrees. East of it, at the end of the First Clime by a degree in longitude, is the city of Tana (Thana). It is the last of the famous cities of al-Lar on the tongues of merchants. The people of this Indian coast are all disbelievers who worship idols (Abdad). Muslims live with them, and their ships travel to them. Most of what they worship is the idol of Somnath; it is venerated by Indians who travel to it from regions. It has a white building visible to ships at sea from afar. Most of what grows in the land of al-Lar is Brazilwood (Baqjam), and from it Lac (Lakk) is brought, which is the gum of their trees.",

    "text": "Part Eight: The first thing you encounter from the beginning of its line, where latitude is fifteen degrees, among the famous cities of Pepper in the land of Malabar, is the city of Saymur. It is on a bay and an inlet to its west and inside it to the South. The most famous on the tongues of travelers in this sea is Faknur (Bakanur). It is on an inlet to its east where longitude is one hundred and twenty-nine degrees and latitude thirteen degrees minus two minutes. In its direction regarding latitude is Manjarur (Mangalore); between them in longitude is two degrees, and it has an inlet to its west. About two courses from Manjarur is the Ghat, from which ships descend, for if they fall into its paths they get lost and find no way out unless God facilitates it for them. They are mountains in the sea where the path is from a mile to fifty miles, and its end is blocked with no escape; stories about it are strange. It is from the direction of this city mentioned in the Second Clime. East of Manjarur in a direction intended by ships is Kawlam (Quilon). It is the last of the Pepper lands and famous on the tongues of travelers; ginger is often attributed to it. It is where longitude is one hundred and thirty-four degrees, and latitude twelve degrees. From it to the Island of Ceylon (Saylan) is two courses. This island is long and wide. Ibn Fatimah said: The investigation regarding it states its length is six hundred miles and its width approximates that, so its circumference is over two thousand miles. It has cavities from the sea and unrenowned cities. Mentioned in books is al-Ramin, by which it was known in ancient times. Famous on the tongues of travelers is Saylan; to it, Ceylonese Oud is attributed, though not of the highest quality. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and thirty-nine degrees twenty minutes, and latitude seven and a half degrees. Both cities are on an inlet descending from a mountain in its northwestern corner; between them is two hundred and fifty miles. In this island is the Rhinoceros. In its outskirts are the Naked Ones who leap onto trees due to their lightness. Ptolemy called it the Island of the Naked. South of it are the Islands of al-Najbalus (Nicobar?); they are several, the largest being three. Their people are deformed naked blacks who intercept travelers, and among them are those who eat people. They neighbor the Equator, and the width of the sea between them and the Island of Ceylon is about two courses.",

    "text": "Part Nine: The first Indian Islands you meet is the Island of Nakwarah (Nicobar). It is among the islands famous on the tongues of travelers; its length is about one hundred miles and its width half that. Between it and the sea where the land of Barqali is, is about half a course. Between it and the beginning of this part is a degree. South of it is the Island of Andaman; between them is about two courses, and it is of similar size. In all of them, elephants are found and ivory is prepared from them. East of these two islands, with the entry to the West from the line of the Second Clime, are two cities of the cities of al-Ramin on a bay of the sea; the bay between them is where longitude is one hundred and forty-nine degrees. East and south of that are the Islands of al-Mahraj (Maharaja/Srivijaya). They are many and mentioned in books. Good gold is found in them. Their ruler is one of the richest kings of India and has the most elephants. His large island, containing the city of al-Mahraj, is two hundred miles long and nearly one hundred miles wide. The city is at its western end where longitude is one hundred and fifty-one degrees and latitude twelve and a half degrees. East of the city is an inlet with its source from a mountain to its north. It is said this king's palace is on a wide stream whose bottom is paved with silver and bounded at both ends so nothing placed in it exits. The custom of every king among them since owning these islands is that the king throws a brick of gold every year. When he dies, the bricks are counted, the length of his reign is known, one brick is returned, and the rest is spent on the soldiers during this incumbent king's reign. The single brick has a place and the others have a place. If they want to know how many kings ruled them, they count the single bricks with a rod. They do not remove them from their place; rather, it is in a spot where the sun shines, so that gold glitters through the water. There are gems of ruby and emerald and large pearls, with which he competes with kings and boasts over them. It is mentioned that the place is the treasury of these stores. They said: It is not known that this island has transferred from one lineage to another; they boast of that over their neighbors. Al-Mahraj is a title they inherit. South of the Island of al-Mahraj is the Island of al-Jawah (Java) the Large, famous, intended by ships. Most of what is in it is Indian spices and its people are famous for good conduct with travelers. Its western beginning is where longitude is one hundred and forty-four degrees. In that corner, among its cities famous on the tongues of merchants, is Lamri (Lamuri), and the latitude there is five degrees. South of it in the southwestern corner is the city of Fansur, to which Fansuri Camphor is attributed. It aligns with the other in longitude, and its latitude is one and a half degrees. The Camphor Mountains extend from the city to near the end of the island from west to east. In the middle of the island on the Camphor Mountains is its capital, the city of al-Jawah. In it is the ruler of the island and the adjacent islands attributed to it. To this city is attributed the black, solid Javanese Oud that sinks in water as if it were a pebble; it is said to be the root of the Oud tree. The location of this city is where longitude is one hundred and forty-nine degrees twenty minutes and latitude three degrees. In the southeast corner is the city of Kalah (Kedah/Klang?), famous on the tongues of travelers. To it is attributed the preferred Kalahi (tin/lead) in its rods and paints. It is said they make their ships from that, so there is nothing like them in the Indian Ocean. This city is where longitude is one hundred and fifty-four degrees twelve minutes. In the northeast side is the city of Malayur, famous and intended for landing and takeoff. Its longitude approximates the longitude of Kalah, and its latitude approximates the latitude of Lamri. Every city mentioned in this island is on an inlet. The length of this island is eight hundred miles from West to East, and its width revolves around three hundred and forty miles. When ships overlooking China depart from it, two ends appear to the right and left; the width of the sea between them is about two miles. The water there is not deep; that place is called al-Bintan. There are small islands from which black thieves emerge with poisoned arrows and aggressive boats; they take loot but do not take people. Some trustworthy travelers said: We had two ships; the goods were in one and I in the other. God saved the ship I was in until He brought me to China. He said: I saw there a white bondwoman containing [...] from the land, so I marveled at her being there with those disbelievers. If travelers exit al-Bintan, they give good news of safety. One overlooking al-Bintan encounters the Islands of Qamarun. In the largest of them is the King's city, east of the city of al-Jawah. The city's name is Qamarun. Their lineage was mentioned in the Island of al-Qamar. This island is where longitude is one hundred and fifty-eight degrees",

West of its small islands are islands annexed to Java containing Indian spices and Kalahi tin (lead). Among them is the Island of the Volcano mentioned before. And among them are the Islands of the Abyss whose bottom cannot be reached. After the northern Islands of Qamarun are the Camphor Mountains; they are innumerable, extending into the sea. Ships travel from them to China. They belong to Qamarun, but the owners of China have conquered them or what is near their coast. The trees in it are like willow trees in their leaves, but a single tree shades a hundred men. Camphor is its gum. It is said they tap the tree and pieces of camphor flow from it, then the tree dies afterwards. One who traveled among these mountains said: I saw them at night like stars in the sky illuminating from them. I asked about it and was told: In every mountain of them is a temple (Buddha/Bud) having people who worship God in it, and they revive the night with lamps for the wayfarers.

    "text": "Part Ten: The first thing you encounter in it are the Islands of China. The first, from the side of the Chinese coast to the northern direction, is Sandarfulat (Campa ports/Pulo Condore?), one of the islands mentioned in books. Between it and the Chinese coast is less than two courses. Its length is about two hundred miles. Its widest part is its northern head, about one hundred and fifty miles. South of it is the Island of al-Sanf (Champa), famous in books, to which the noblest Oud (Agarwood) is attributed. It is said to be like wax in which writing can be imprinted, and it is white. The kings of China do not leave it for others. The length of this island from West to East is about two hundred miles, and the width is less than that. The city of al-Sanf is where longitude is one hundred and sixty-two degrees and latitude six degrees. West of it is the Island of Qamar (Khmer?), to which Qamari Oud is attributed; it is inferior to Sanfi and superior to others. The width of the sea between them is less than a course. It is close to the Island of al-Sanf in length and width. The city of Qamar's longitude is one hundred and sixty-six degrees and latitude two degrees. East of these three islands are the small Islands of China; they are many, extending from the North to the end of habitation in the South. The end of the Indian Ocean known as the Green Sea is east of these islands. The longitude there is about one hundred and sixty-seven and a half degrees. Between this Green Sea and the Black Surrounding Ocean (Pacific/unknown) remains land. In its west along the east of the sea passes Khamdan, which is one of the world's great rivers with abundant water. There is no river in China longer or wider than it. Its source is from the Great Mountain separating China and the Turks along the line of the Fourth Clime. Its mouth is where the Indian Ocean mixes with the Surrounding Ocean at the end of habitation in the South. Its distance is about three thousand miles. On it are a large number of cities. Located on it in this Tenth Part is the city of Qantu (Canton/Guangzhou?), where longitude is sixty-nine degrees [sic, likely 169] and latitude eleven degrees. South of it on its east also is the city of Susah; between them is sixteen stages. They are close in longitude; Susah is further east where latitude is two degrees. Three large rivers pour from the rivers of China into the Surrounding Ocean east of Khamdan. Located in the Surrounding Ocean at the far end of this part are the Sila Islands (Korea/Japan). They are like the Eternal Islands in the Surrounding Ocean; there is no habitation behind them. But these are inhabited, possessing fertility and bounties. The last of them to the East is the Island of Sanji, which has the idols indicating \"No passage behind me.\" Its eastern end is where longitude is one hundred and eighty degrees. South of these islands is the Island of Silver. Ptolemy mentioned it and its river. It is said its land has much silver. Beside it at the furthest habitation in the East is the Island of Ruby (Yaqut). The Great Mountain mentioned by Ptolemy encircles it from inside. It is said to be like Mount Rahun in Serendib, where varieties of ruby are found. The end of this part is with the Equator. Second Clime: Inhabitants of what neighbors the First Clime are black, and what neighbors the Third Clime are brown. Its width is twenty-four degrees thirty-one minutes from the Equator, and its breadth (extent) is eight degrees four minutes. Part One: Located in it is the sixth island of the Eternal Islands and four of the Islands of Happiness. The ascent of the Surrounding Ocean in it eastward ends where longitude is ten degrees. Then the Gulf of Tunny (Tuna) ascends from the Second Clime three degrees; its width is less than two degrees. It is called the Green Gulf because it contains reefs and much green grass (seaweed), and in it is the school of Tunny. It enters once into the Sea of the Romans (Mediterranean); people claim it makes pilgrimage to a known stone in the islands of the sea then returns. The people of the coasts of the Berber lands and Andalusia live off it; they dry it and preserve it as jerked meat, carrying it to lands where it sells for the highest price during the time of grapes and figs. Ibn Fatimah mentioned that he rode the Surrounding Ocean once at Nul Lamta. The ship was breached, so he fell into fog and reefs. The sailors got lost and did not know where they were until they left the large ship and took provisions in the small boat. They dragged it over the grass and at times rowed with oars until they ended up after a while at the bottom of this gulf. They witnessed the Tunny in it and its abundance, which amazed them, as well as white birds. They did not reach land until provisions were nearly exhausted. When they ended up under the Shining Mountain (Jabal al-Lamma'), the Berbers of Gudala signaled them not to approach the mountain. They did not know the reason, so they took north away from it until they exited its limit.",

    "text": "When they went out to the coast, they did not understand the language of Gudala until a person came who understood both languages. He asked them about their straying, and they informed him. The people of the boat asked about their warning against the Shining Mountain. They said: It is all deadly, lethal snakes. The stranger sees it shining with stones of beautiful colors and is deceived into approaching it, then its snakes destroy him. They gave them the good news of safety and bought the boat from them. They traveled with them to the city of Taghira, the capital of Gudala, where longitude is eleven degrees and latitude twenty degrees. They stayed with them drinking she-camel milk and eating dried camel meat until their departure to Nul was arranged, so they left with them. He said: Their land, despite being desert and sand, has good sugar cane due to the five rivers descending from the Shining Mountain. Ptolemy mentioned them and reported that the middle river is known as the River of Snakes. They are plentiful near the Shining Mountain and the connecting mountains. God sent them as a punishment on the people of those regions, but they turned them into a blessing, as they prefer eating them over chicken. Connected in this part to the Shining Mountain is the Mountain of Lamtuna, where the Sultanate of the Veiled Ones (Almoravids) was. It extends where longitude is fifteen degrees and latitude three degrees from the line of the Second Clime, passing east taking to the North until it exceeds the Second Clime. In its west is their capital Azqi. Its longitude is fourteen and a half degrees and minutes, and its latitude twenty-two degrees. From it, one enters the Desert of the Lamt (Oryx/Antelope) which is between these lands and the lands of Sudan. Al-Bakri mentioned that this city is in the mountain; it is a fortress with palm trees. From this animal, the Lamt, the impregnable Lamt shields are made and tanned in the city of Kawkadam. They subsist on she-camel milk. This city is north and west of Azqi; between them is eight days. Between it and the Line from which the Third Clime exits is a degree and a half. It belongs to the Muslim Massufa. Their mountain to its east connects to the Shining Mountain, which takes to the North until it connects to Mount Gazula. This mountain is long, from the Surrounding Ocean until it ends where longitude is twelve degrees and latitude is with the line of the Third Clime. In its south is the capital of Gazula, the city of Taghawost. Between it and the line of the Third is a degree. Between it and the Surrounding Ocean is Gazula. West of it is the city of Lamta Nul. It is where longitude is seven and a half degrees. Between it and the line of the Third Clime is half a degree. It has a large famous river descending from Mount Lamta east of it by two stages, and from its south and west until it crosses the line of the Third Clime and descends into the Surrounding Ocean. Between it and Lamta Nul is three stages. The sea continues after ascending east; whenever it takes north from the five rivers, it descends west until it is below Nul where the line of the Third Clime is at longitude six degrees. The end of this part in the desert is the Fortress of Salt (Hisn al-Milh), built on mineral salt. From it, travelers take salt to the lands of Sudan. Between it and the capital of Lamtuna, Azqi, is seven days. Between it and the line of the Second Clime is three and a half degrees. Part Two: Ibn Fatimah said: In its position, there is no water, pasture, or habitation, but flowing sands and misleading, obliterated paths. Most of what is in it is the Lamt (oryx); it is patient against thirst and resembles the gazelle but is thicker. The first thing you meet in this part is the Desert of Nisar (Sir?) which travelers cross between Sijilmasa and Ghana. It is long and wide; they endure intense thirst and glowing heat in it. Perhaps a southern wind blows and dries the water in the skins. So they return to the water in the bellies of camels; they place muzzles on their mouths so they eat nothing. If the wind dries their water, they slaughter them camel by camel and drink what is in their bellies. There is no mentioned city in this part other than Awdaghust. Its inhabitants are a mix of Muslim Berbers, and leadership belongs to Sanhaja. This city and its ruler have prominence in Al-Bakri's book \"Al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik\". It is with the line of the Second Clime where longitude is twenty-two degrees. At its latitude is the city of Zafun, belonging to disbelieving Sudan. Its ruler has a house among the kings of Sudan. Mount al-Kaf extends in this desert from east of Lamtuna until it aligns with Awdaghust, then curves South, leaving five stages between it and Zafun. They guide themselves by it in those deserts, except they do not approach it due to its many snakes. On its northern back is Mount Mizab, which is high. The people of Warglan take refuge in it if oppression from those in power befalls them. Between them is four days.",

    "text": "Part Three: Ibn Fatimah said: The beginnings of this part follow the rule of deserts, flowing sands, and lack of water, running the course of the part before it, until you meet the edge of Mount Maquris from which the River Kawkaw exits entering the First Clime. Then the land of Kawar; they are Muslim Sudan and their capital is named Kawar. It is now under the obedience of the Sultan of Kanem. Its location is where longitude is forty-five degrees and latitude twenty degrees and minutes. West of it by two stages is the famous Lake Kawar. Its length is twelve miles and its width three miles. It is sweet and deep; in it is the Buri fish (Mullet) which they salt and carry to the lands. East of Kawar by a stage is Lake al-Sul. Its length is twenty miles and width four miles. It is sweet, shallow, in which appears fish with many spines. A spring supplies it coming from the south from a small mountain. Conflict often occurs between the inhabitants of Kawar, the desert Berbers, and the Arabs of Fezzan over these two lakes, as these factions constantly graze their directions. North and west of Kawar, among their cities mentioned on the main road, is Qasr Isa (Fortress of Isa), four stages from it. West of it on that course is al-Qasbah. It has palms and pasture; alum (shabb) is found in its land and carried to the lands. Kawar has cities and settlements other than these but they are obscure. They have domains in the Second Clime and in the north of the First. They have adopted the manners of Whites in wearing wool, cotton, and cloaks. The great Mount Luniya extends south of these cities to near the bend of the Egyptian Nile. Therefore, it is said that a branch of the Nile water sinks at it and exits after a long distance in Mount Maquris mentioned before, from which the River Kawkaw exited; others said otherwise. North of this mountain extending from West to East is the land of Barkami. They are Sudan, people of well-being (peaceful/prosperous). They have valleys between mountains with palms, waters, and vegetables. Those of them loyal to the land of Kanem are Muslims. Those loyal to the land of Nubia are Christians. Those loyal to Zaghawa are idolaters. Mount Luniya overlooking them going to the land of Kawar has small rivers descending from it in which travelers find mercy. Ibn Fatimah said: It is said they are from the seepage of the Nile sinking into the mountain. South of Mount Luniya are the domains of the disbelieving Zaghawa; they are called Sha'wah. North of Kawar is Mount Gharghah extending from West to East; between it and the line of the Third Clime is a stage. They recounted that in it are large ants the size of sparrows. East of Kawar with a tilt to the North are the domains of Sandaratah. They are veiled Muslim Berbers, but they give inheritance to the sister's son, following a custom they had before Islam. At the western tip of Mount Luniya between mountains and valleys is the city of Tadmakka. It is known to travelers and mentioned in books. Its people are Muslim Berbers who trade frequently and travel to the land of Sudan; they are under the obedience of Kanem. Its location is south of the mountain and north of the line of the Second Clime where longitude is forty-four degrees and minutes. At the end of this part on the eastern side are the Southern Oases. Most are wastelands containing islands of palms in the sands and waters, mostly not fresh. Part Four: The first thing you meet in its west is the island of the Egyptian Nile. On its two sides are settlements of Nubia until in the middle is the Island of Bilaq (Philae/Bulaq? likely Philae given context), containing the city of Bilaq famous among travelers. It is on this eastern arm, and below it pours the Nile of Abyssinia.",

Then the Nile flows east until the Mountain of the Cataracts (Janadil) is located east where longitude is fifty-six degrees twenty minutes and latitude twenty-two and a half degrees. From its north begins the barrier passing west of the Egyptian Nile until it crosses Fayoum. To the Mountain of the Cataracts is the limit for Nubian ships descending north and Egyptian ships ascending south, because it is high from the south side, and the water descends from it with a terrifying drop. There are large jagged rocks there that prevent ships from crossing. Then the Nile twists North, so on its east is the city of Aswan, the first city of Upper Egypt (Sa'id) of the Egyptian lands, where longitude is fifty-seven degrees and latitude twenty-three degrees. The Nile flows east from it then twists like the letter Nun (ن) on the line of the Third Clime. In the direction of Aswan to the East is the road to Hijaz. Whoever takes east goes on the Wadih (Clear Path). There the road of Qus meets the road of Aswan. It was known as al-Wadih because the road becomes clear there, free of the entangled mountains found in the road of Qus. It is where longitude is sixty-one degrees and latitude close to Aswan. Most pilgrims take the Upper Road inclining to the South. West of it is al-Allaqi, the city of the King of the Beja, where longitude is sixty-three degrees and latitude twenty degrees three minutes. The Beja are blacks; among them are Muslims, Christians, and idolaters. They are the ones who guide pilgrims and merchants in those deserts on their camels. They are famous for honesty. Fear on this road comes from the raids of the Nubians on reddish camels. Mount al-Allaqi is famous; good gold is found in its valleys. Located from it is 'Aydhab, the famous port where longitude is sixty-four and a half degrees and latitude twenty-one degrees twenty minutes. The width of the sea from it to Jeddah is two degrees. Jeddah is tilted in latitude to the North by minutes. Mecca, may Allah honor and glorify it, is to its east tilted slightly South, where longitude is sixty-seven degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude twenty-one degrees thirty-one minutes. East of it is Ta'if, to which Ta'ifi leather is attributed. Between them is a degree in longitude. Ta'if is wider (higher latitude) by minutes. Lemons and grapes are brought from it to Mecca. At the end of the part where longitude is seventy-one degrees seventy-six minutes [sic] and latitude twenty-one degrees twenty-one minutes is al-Yamamah, the capital of its lands in ancient times. Near it is Hajar, which became its capital in early Islam. Then the capital of the lands became the city of Hadramawt (unlikely context, possibly error in text or referring to a different settlement); it is north of the city (Medina? or the city just mentioned) by two stages. Between al-Yamamah and Tihama is the land of Najd, inhabited in tents by the foot soldiers of the Arabs. Between Najd and Tihama are the Sarawat (mountains), extending from south Yemen to north Hijaz, with many plantings, settled by the eloquent Arabs. East of Jeddah and south of it on the coast of the sea, among the mentioned lands of Yemen, is al-Sirrain; between them is three stages. East and south of it, among the mentioned ports of Yemen, is Haly; between them is two stages. East and south of it, among the mentioned ports, is 'Athr. West of it in the sea is the Island of Dahlak, famous on the tongues of merchants. Its length is about eighty miles, and between it and the mainland of Yemen is about thirty miles. It belongs to Muslim Abyssinians; its ruler flatters the ruler of Yemen and taxes ships. East of 'Athr is Sa'dah, the city of leather (Barid/post? likely leather/hides); between them is four stages. Between it and the line of the Second Clime is a degree. Around the Island of Dahlak south and north are islands, inhabited and empty, returning to its ruler. Perhaps he fights over them with the ruler of the Island of Suakin. He is of the Beja (Buhar?), a Muslim, having taxes on ships. Ships divert to him from the mainland of the Arabs, Hijaz, and Yemen because that is easier for them. Suakin is very small, less than a mile. Between it and the Abyssinian mainland is a strait crossed by swimming. Between Suakin and 'Aydhab by sea is about seven stages. West of Suakin on the Nile of Abyssinia is the land of al-Bakah, brothers of the Abyssinians on this Nile.",

    "text": "Part Five: The first thing you encounter in its west is Najran, located at the end of the mountains of Yemen, a capital for its governors, where longitude is seventy-five degrees and latitude seventeen degrees. Near it is a city called Jarash to which many people are attributed. In Najran are the People of the Ditch (Ashab al-Ukhdud) mentioned in the Great Quran. East of it, where longitude is seventy-six and a half degrees and latitude seventeen degrees, is the city of Marib, famous in the time of the Tubba's. It is the last of the mountains of Hadramawt. In it was the Dam mentioned in the Quran. East of that are the wastelands between Hadramawt, al-Yamamah, and Oman; no one can traverse them due to shifting sands and thirst. Suhar is located there; it was the city of Oman in ancient times, where longitude is eighty-one degrees and latitude nineteen degrees fifty-six minutes. Between it and the shifting sands is Mount Nizwa, extending from South to North inhabited by the Kharijites (Ibadi). Their city in it is named Nizwa, where longitude is seventy-eight and a half degrees and latitude nineteen and a half degrees. Between Qalhat, the current capital of Oman mentioned at the end of the First Clime's latitude, and Suhar is Muscat (al-Masqat). It is a guard post on a great bay of the Persian Sea where longitude is seventy-nine degrees fifty minutes and latitude eighteen degrees sixty minutes. Between it and Suhar in the sea is al-Dardur (The Whirlpool), where the three mountains called Kusayr, 'Uwayr, and a third in which there is no good. The water spins there; if a ship falls into it, it breaks it on those mountains. It is at the mouth of the Persian Sea from the Indian Ocean. This mouth is wide; its width from Suhar to the coast of India is about two hundred and eighty miles. Hajar, the capital of the lands of Bahrain in ancient times, is located on the coast of this sea in a bay larger than the Bay of Muscat, where longitude is seventy-eight degrees forty minutes and latitude twenty-two degrees thirty minutes. Its dates are proverbial for abundance. The Qarmatians destroyed it and built the city of al-Ahsa. Between it and al-Yamamah are the domains of Banu 'Amir; no dignity remains with them for any Arab in the lands of al-Yamamah and Bahrain. From them are now the kings of the two regions. The Persian Sea does not occupy the rest of this part except the amount of the land of al-Mand. They are brothers of Sindh and Hind; their business is highway robbery and bloodshed. Their lands are between the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Sindh entering from the Persian Sea in Part Six. The amount of land opening between the two seas from South to North is one hundred and sixty miles. It has a city named al-Mand on the bay of the Gulf of Sindh, where longitude is thirty-five and a half degrees and latitude twenty degrees thirty minutes. Part Six: On its Indian Ocean coast are the Islands of the Diba (Maldives). The largest was mentioned previously. The most famous on the coast of this part among the ports of India intended by merchants from Aden and elsewhere is the city of al-Qusa (?). It is a drainage for ships making it easy to land and takeoff. It is counted in the lands of Gujarat. To it is attributed the Qusi Lac, which is abundant in the lands of Gujarat; it is the gum of trees there. Its people are disbelievers worshipping idol statues, and Muslims live with them. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and seven degrees and latitude seventeen degrees ten minutes. Located in this part among the cities of Sindh mentioned in books is Qandabil, where the Mand shop. It is between the end of the Gulf of Sindh and the Indian Ocean in the wilderness, where longitude is ninety-three degrees forty minutes, and latitude on the alignment of Suhar is nineteen degrees fifty-six minutes. East of it are the Mountains of Bamboo (Khayzuran). In the valleys of these mountains is Teak (Saj) carried to Persia and Iraq by sea, and Indian Canes carried to regions. East of it is the mouth of the rivers of Multan, which is the seat of a kingdom of the kingdoms of Sindh on the western river among them, where longitude is one hundred and four degrees and latitude with the line of the Third Clime. Located in an inlet from the land in the Gulf of Sindh is the famous city of Daybul, from which Daybuli goods are brought. It is the largest and most famous port of Sindh. Its location is where longitude is ninety-two degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude twenty-four degrees thirty-one minutes.",

    "text": "Part Seven: In its coastal south of the Indian lands of Gujarat lies Cambay (Kanbaya). It is famous, intended by merchants of India. Muslims reside there and have mosques. It is on the first line of the Second Clime where longitude is one hundred and seventeen degrees. It has a salty inlet entered by small ships. The large anchorage is half a stage from it. East of it is Somnath, previously mentioned. The sea after it enters into the First Clime. North of it is the city of Nahrawala (Anhilwara), capital of Gujarat, where longitude is one hundred and seventeen degrees and latitude nineteen degrees forty minutes. East and north of it is Gwalior (Jaliyor?), capital of the 'Adisi of the kings of India. It is famous among Muslim merchants passing from Cambay to Delhi. It is where longitude is one hundred and nineteen degrees and latitude twenty-one degrees forty-four minutes. In the South and North of this part are large settlements of India with obscure names. In its west and north are the Mountains of al-Ghushm (The Oppressors?), Indians who do not practice good policy with merchants, so no Muslim enters them nor does anyone other than their religion dwell with them; they are like wild beasts. Part Eight: In it lies the land of Malabar from which pepper is brought. Its famous port enters into the First Clime. In it lies the capital of the lands of the Maknunat (Hidden Ones?), Aknuni (?). Mountains and waters surround it. It belongs to Indian disbelievers, where longitude is one hundred and thirty-five and a half degrees and latitude twenty-three and a half degrees. It is east of the great River Ganges (Kank), venerated by Indians, and west of the River Soliyan. A large number of waters and rivers descend to its lands, all pouring into these two rivers. As for the River Ganges, it pours into the Indian Ocean. West of it is Tarkhinah, the port of the Maknunat, famous among merchants frequenting those lands. It is with the line of the Second Clime where longitude aligns with Aknun. As for the River Soliyan, it pours west of the city of Ma'bar, famous on tongues. It is the capital of the Soliyan (Cholas). From it, clothes whose bleaching is proverbial are brought. It is where longitude is one hundred and forty-two degrees and latitude seventeen degrees twenty-five minutes. North of it, with the line of the Third Clime, are mountains connected to the lands of Ballhara, the King of Kings of India. The end of this part is the capital of Barqali, where longitude is one hundred and forty-three and a half degrees and latitude twenty degrees twenty minutes. South of it is a long salty inlet; its length from the Indian Ocean is about two and a half courses, its width thirty miles, and its minimum ten. Part Nine: In its west is the land of Barqali. East of it is the Inlet of Fufal (Betel Nut); it is fresh, long, and wide, entered by large travelers' ships. Its length from the Indian Ocean is about four courses. Its origin is from a large lake with the Third Clime between the mountains of Ballhara. On its east by the sea is the capital Fufal, famous on the tongues of travelers by sea to India. It belongs to Indian disbelievers, where longitude is one hundred and forty-six degrees and latitude with the line of the Second Clime. East of it are the mountains of Qaqula having lands and cities; the mentioned one is Qaqula. It is where longitude is one hundred and fifty degrees and latitude twenty-one degrees fifty minutes. It has a river descending from a mountain in its north passing its east and pouring into the great River Taragha. East of the land of Qaqula is the Great Mountain extending from the line of the Fourth Clime to the Indian Ocean, separating it from the land of al-Hanbah. Famous among them is the capital of al-Hanbah, east of the great River Taragha. East of it is the Mountain of China separating it from the land of al-Hanbah. From there, rivers and mountains extend in China; they are twelve rivers and twelve mountains, a river between every two mountains. The first to be located in this Ninth Part is the River Zaytun (Quanzhou). At its head is the port of Zaytun, famous on the tongues of merchants arriving at the Chinese lands. Ships enter it from the China Sea about fifteen miles. It is where longitude is one hundred and fifty-four degrees and latitude seventeen degrees and minutes. On the River Luqin, the fourth river of China, is the city of Luqin (Hanoi/Long Bien?). It is famous among Chinese ports, located in an inlet on the sea where longitude is fifty-nine degrees fifty minutes [sic, likely 159] and latitude close to the line of the Second Clime. East of it is the greatest River Khamdan. On it at the end of this part is the city of Khanfu (Canton/Hangzhou?), mentioned in books, located on its east near the line of the Second Clime.",

    "text": "Part Ten: In it lie the remaining rivers and mountains of China as depicted in geography. East of China is the mountain separating them from Sin-Sin (China of China/Outer China). The appearances of the people of China incline towards the appearances of the Khalat (mixed breed), between Turks and Indians. Their clothing is average. Among their customs is revealing their chests. Their Sultan is called the Baghbur (Son of Heaven), and his capital is the city of Tajah in the Third Clime. His subjects are enclosed by mountains and fortresses, so no one enters from their side nor exits without permission. It is said all roads in China are paved with stones, with farms on the right and left. Most of it is rice; they claim a worm eats it which frankincense kills, therefore much [...] is carried to their lands. Chinese Rhubarb is plentiful in this land. It is said they have turnips with which they cook meat while green. Elephants are many among them; they carry their loads on them. Most of their buildings are of camphor wood and pine. They place beautiful paints and exquisite carvings of the Kalahi type in them, as well as their ships. The name of the ship among them is the Zuw (Junk?); it is large, having a storehouse for goods between the person and beneath him. They transact with large ingots of gold and silver. They have copper coins (Fulus) for small amounts. Their language is difficult, while the language of the Indians is sweeter. Their ships in this era have started reaching Aden. At the end of this part from the land of Sin-Sin are obscure cities. At the end of the inhabited world in it is the Island of the Alawites. The Umayyads had sent them to the King of China and told him they were criminals requiring exile. When they appeared before him, they told him they were from the House of Prophecy. He said: Carry them to the island at the end of Sin-Sin; it has many deadly vipers. If it is as they claimed, they will not harm them; if they kill them, I will be relieved of them. So God protected them from them, and they inhabited that island and multiplied. Al-Bayhaqi said: From them are most of the Sharifs (Nobles) of the non-Arabs who tie braids in their heads as a sign of those snakes from which God saved them. Third Clime: Its inhabitants are brown. Its latitude from the Equator is thirty degrees twelve minutes, and its extent is six degrees minus nineteen minutes.",

    "text": "Part One: The Surrounding Ocean ends in it at six degrees. There at its beginning is the mouth of the River Nul. On it are many settlements of Lamta; it is famous. North of it, among the famous ports, is Samtamat. It is a fortress on a cape protruding into the sea, cut off from the mainland by water. Longitude is six and latitude twenty-six and a quarter degrees. Sailors say between it and the river mouth is fifty miles. North of it pours the River Masat; on it is the famous Ribat (fortress/monastery) where the righteous take refuge. Between the two places is sixty miles. From the mouth of this river to the mouth of the River Sus, where sugar cane grows, is twelve miles. Between it and Agadir al-Tarf—the edge of the great Mount Daran entering the sea—is six miles. From there to the mouth of the river [...] is sixty miles; it is in the land of Hahah. From it, salt is shipped to those coasts south and north. From this river to the mouth of the River Amgaddul (Mogador) is forty miles; it is also in the land of Hahah. There is a small island with a mile between it and the river; there is a winter anchorage for ships. From this river to the mouth of the River Tansift, which passes north of Marrakesh, is eighteen miles. There is the port of Aghmat. Between it and the port of Marrakesh, now famous as the city of Safi (Asfi), is thirty-two miles. It is the end of the Clime on an entering bay; longitude there is seven degrees and latitude thirty degrees. North of the city is a cape entering the sea for forty miles called Kansuli, which ships guard against. Located in it is the city of al-Sus, named Taroudant, on the river from the northern side, where longitude is eight degrees and latitude twenty-six degrees twenty minutes. It has many obscure settlements. Its river, the River Masat, and the River Nul all come from the South and East from Mount Lamta connected to Mount Gazula in the Second Clime. It passes in this Third Clime to Sijilmasa. South of it is Mount Sartah; they are like Saltah, tribes of the veiled Berbers. It exits from the Second Clime east of Daran to west of Sijilmasa. West of it by two stages is the city of Draa... Its location is where longitude is eleven degrees six minutes and latitude twenty-five degrees ten minutes. Its famous river to its west descends from red hills at Mount Daran. It is a journey of seven days in continuous settlements. Most of what grows on it is Henna carried to the Maghreb regions until what remains of it sinks into the desert of the Second Clime. East of Draa is the city of Sijilmasa, a famous provincial capital where longitude is thirteen degrees twenty-two minutes and latitude twenty-six degrees twenty-four minutes. Its river comes from the South and East, its source from Mount Azru, which has many snakes, and from its springs. It divides from there into two parts, then the two parts meet and connect on its west and east. It has eight gates; wherever you exit from it, you see the river, palm trees, and other trees. This river pours into the River Ziz, which runs with it and the river of Sijilmasa to it for five days in settlements and bounties. Then the River Ziz pours into the River Moulouya, which pours into the Sea of the Romans (Mediterranean). Connected to Mount Azru are the mountains of Sanhaja; they are many, cohesive, and winding. This tribe is the largest of the Berber tribes; in every land, there is a multitude of them. They mention their origin is from the Arabs of Yemen, and Arabism is apparent among them. Among their mountains is their capital, the city of Takla, where longitude is twelve degrees and latitude thirty degrees. Connected from its west to the Surrounding Ocean is the great famous Mount Daran (High Atlas), where the land of the Masmuda lies; they are known as the Almohads who ruled the Berbers. First in it from the East is the land of Haskurah, then west of it the land of Hazrajah, then the land of Harghah, the tribe of the Mahdi (Ibn Tumart). Most of them claim they are from the descendants of Al-Hussein bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them. West of them is the land of Hintatah, the tribe of Sheikh Abu Hafs, the greatest of the Almohad sheikhs; the authority of Ifriqiya is now in his progeny. They attribute themselves to Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him. West of them is the land of Tinmal, the fortress which no creature has a way against due to its being cut off by cliffs and abysses from all sides. No one crosses to it except on a bridge lifted during war. West of it is Kadmiwah and the land of Janfisah. West of it is the land of Hahah, distinguished by white honey and large good oxen, just as Tinmal is distinguished by oil preferred in all the Maghreb. West of it is the land of Ragragah, distinguished by a tree whose oil was preferred over what is pressed from olives, and its scent is fragrant. In it, cloths of utmost fineness and softness are made, with which the women of the capital wrap themselves. In it is the River Shafshawah, having large good pomegranates. This land is connected to the Surrounding Ocean. North of Mount Daran is Aghmat...",

    "text": "...which was the metropolis of the country before the building of Marrakesh. It has waters and many fruits. North of it with a slight tilt to the West by about fifteen miles is the metropolis of the Maghreb, Marrakesh. Yusuf bin Tashfin, the ruler of the Veiled Ones (Almoravids), built it in a desert land and brought water to it. People multiplied orchards in it. Its unhealthiness (Wakham) has increased, and a stranger hardly escapes fever there, especially the Veiled Ones. Four miles from it is the River Tansift descending from Mount Daran, passing its east and north. On it are mills, and canals exit from it irrigating the orchards and pouring into the beautiful River Nafis, on whose banks are vineyards with preferred grapes, many orchards, and preferred settlements. At its mouth in the Surrounding Ocean is the old port of Aghmat. The latitude of Marrakesh is disputed; it was said thirty-one degrees, but the correct is twenty-nine degrees. [Repetition of previous text regarding Marrakesh...]. Part Two: Connected to desolate deserts. Located in it among the mentioned lands is a land and its city called Warglan (Ouargla), where longitude is twenty and a half degrees and latitude twenty-four and a half degrees ten minutes. It is a land of palms and slaves; from it, slaves enter the Central Maghreb and Ifriqiya. Travel from it in the desert to the land of Sudan is frequent. East of it is the land of Righ (Oued Righ), its length about five days. It is a land of palms, citrons, and waters springing on the surface of the earth; the water rises like an arrow for a long span and flows into the farms. The name of its capital is Tamariyah, where longitude is twenty-three degrees. East of it is the city of Biskra, capital of the land of Zab. It is a land of palms and crops; from it, types of dates are brought to the capitals Tunis and Bejaia. It is where longitude is twenty-four degrees twenty-five minutes and latitude twenty-seven and a half degrees. North of it is the city of Msila (Al-Masila), which is modern, built by the Ubaydis (Fatimids) on the River Sahar, one of the grand rivers. It passes its west and its waters sink into the desert sands. It is where longitude is twenty-three degrees forty minutes and latitude twenty-nine degrees forty-five minutes. The lands around it are domains of the Arabs of Riyah. Deserts extend in its east until Mount Rahubah, extending from West to East. Ptolemy mentioned its western head is where longitude is thirty degrees fifty minutes and latitude twenty-six degrees and minutes. A river exits from it sinking in its north where the Sabkha (swampy/saline) land is, which is like soap. Often those who took south from the land of Jarid (Date Palms) perished there if ignorant of it. Its border is from the land of Nafzawah to the desert. At the end of this part, from the land of Jarid—which is the land of dates—lies the city of Gafsa. It is a capital famous for palms. Pistachios are hardly found in the Maghreb except there. It has fragrant fruits with many properties. From it, oil of violet and vinegar of squill are brought.",

    "text": "Part Three: The first thing you meet in its west from the land of Jarid is the land of Qastiliya. Its capital is Tozeur. It has palms and citrons; its river comes from above it and irrigates its orchards. It and its lands are islands in the middle of sands, and deserts surround it. It has preferred flax, nabk, and alfalfa. In that and in the scarcity of rain, it resembles the Egyptian lands. Its location is where longitude is thirty-six degrees six minutes, and latitude twenty-nine degrees eight minutes. East of it is the land of Nafzawah; its capital is Turrah where longitude is thirty-seven degrees twenty minutes and latitude twenty-nine degrees. It is also from the land of Jarid. Clear glass and woolen textiles carried to Alexandria and the lands of the Romans (Durub) are brought from it. Ghadames, to which preferred leather is attributed, is situated where longitude is thirty-nine degrees and minutes and latitude twenty-nine degrees ten minutes. They are fortresses on the main road passing to the land of Kanem. East of it is Waddan; they are islands of palms and waters. The first is where longitude is forty-one degrees and latitude twenty-seven degrees fifty minutes. The traveler on the long exhausting road used to take refuge there. East of it is the land of Fezzan; they are also islands of palms and waters, having more cities and settlements than Waddan. All are now in the obedience of the King of Kanem. The capital of Fezzan is the city of Zuwaylah where longitude is forty-three degrees and latitude twenty-seven degrees forty minutes. South of Fezzan and Waddan are the domains of Azkan; they are Muslim Berbers, the most skilled of God's creation in sand geomancy. South of it, to the west of the line of the Third Clime, is Mount Tanta. It is large, extending from East to West about six stages. In its north are springs descending from it, and below them meadows where much grass grows, frequented by Berbers and Bedouins, and war occurs over it. At its bottom is a mine of good iron. North of Zuwaylah is the city of Sirte. It is one of the ancient capitals mentioned in books and on the tongues of passersby. The Arabs destroyed it, and nothing remained but castles inhabited by their followers. Likewise, its regions have castles on the road belonging to Arab carpenters/cultivators who farm around them. The location of this city is where longitude is forty-three and a half degrees and latitude thirty degrees. It is on the coast of the Sea of the Strait (Mediterranean). West of it is the Gulf of Radaqiya, called Gulf of Radiq, not Daqiq. Between Sirte and Ajdabiya, the sea enters to the North in the Fourth Clime. The city of Ajdabiya is located there where longitude is forty-four degrees and latitude with the line of the First [sic, likely Fourth] Clime. Between it and the sea is miles. From it to Fayoum are scattered domains of Arabs and Berbers. Al-Mu'izz built cisterns for rainwater there when he decided to conquer Egypt from Kairouan, as the road through it is shorter, while the coast is a detour. South of the road to Alexandria is Awjila. It is an island in those sands and a settlement in those deserts containing water and palms. It is under the protection of Hayt. It is where longitude is forty-eight degrees fifty-two minutes. In the direction of its latitude is the city of Santariyah (Siwa?) where longitude is forty-five degrees sixty minutes. It is also an island of palms and waters in deserts. Mountains surround it, and Bedouins overlook its directions; the fact that it belongs to the Egyptian Sultanate restrains them from it. In it are pomegranates that are bitter at first then become sweet when ripe. In its land are trees of palm and almond grains brought to Alexandria, at which onlookers marvel. It is deadly with epidemic to its people, let alone strangers. Between the sea and it, at the Small Aqaba, is eight stages. East and south of it are the Northern Oases; they are islands of palms and waters like the previous type. Alum and vitriol are brought from them. North of it is the land of Fayoum; it is not entered except from the desert. The mountain encircles it, extending between it and its lake. The diameter of all that is about a day. Its city where the governor resides is located where longitude is fifty-three degrees and latitude twenty-eight degrees eight minutes. The River of Joseph (Bahr Yusuf), peace be upon him, divides it into two halves and passes through it until it pours into the lake famous for abundant birds and fish. It is said that Joseph, peace be upon him, managed Fayoum and placed in it on that water he brought out from the Nile [...] according to the number of days of the year. It has abundant crops, sugar, flax, and fruits. At the end of this part lies the capital of the Egyptian lands, Cairo (al-Qahira), built by Jawhar, the slave of Al-Mu'izz the Ubaydi (Fatimid), east of the Nile. South of it by a mile is the city of Fustat, laid out by Amr bin al-As, where longitude is fifty-three degrees fifty minutes and latitude twenty-nine degrees fifty-five minutes.",

The location of that is where longitude is fifty-six degrees forty minutes and latitude twenty-seven degrees fifty-six minutes. The river passes westward aligning with the island of the Nile until al-Lahun, where longitude is fifty-four and a half degrees and close to the previous latitude. It is a dam in which river gates were made, dug as a precaution for the increase of the Fayoum river water. If it exceeds the sufficient amount, the excess is vented from those gates into that dug river. East of the exit of al-Manha is the city of Asyut. In its direction is the Mountain of Birds (Jabal al-Tayr). Its story is that birds make pilgrimage to it every year, and one of them descends and hangs in a niche there, famous. Asyut has an island; opium used in medicine is not found except in it, being one of its plants. East of it is Mount al-Taylamun entering the Nile; the water is disturbed because of it in the narrow place, a severe disturbance ships guard against. South of it and south of the previously mentioned lands is Mount Jalut (Goliath). It extends from above the Oases until it aligns with al-Lahun. It is said there are many treasure demands in it, and books are written about it by those occupied with that. It was attributed to Jalut according to their claim, because when he fled from Palestine where the Jalut before him was killed, he stayed in this mountain, and from it entered with his child and people to the Maghreb. South of this mountain is al-Lazward (Lapis Lazuli); they claimed there is a mine for it there, but extracting it was prevented due to the interruption of habitation. The city of Akhmim falls in this part on the east of the Nile where longitude is fifty-five and a half degrees and latitude twenty-six degrees thirty-five minutes. The city of Qus is located where longitude is fifty-seven degrees thirty minutes and latitude twenty-six degrees. It is east of the Nile. North of it and east of Akhmim is the high Mount al-Zift which appears from al-Tur on the eastern mainland. Al-Qusayr, the famous port of Qus on the Sea of Qulzum (Red Sea), is located where longitude is fifty-nine degrees, and the latitude is close to Qus. The beginning of the Sea of Qulzum is in this part, which is its end, where longitude is fifty-five degrees and latitude thirty degrees. From there, the ships of pilgrims and Yemeni merchants travel. The sea there is narrow like a river, then it starts widening to the South and East until its width at Bahr al-Ghazal is about seventy miles. The sea enters the Fourth Clime, as does the longitude. Eilat is on its inlet. Then the sea spreads to the Third Clime, so the watering places of the Egyptian pilgrims are on its coast. Near it lies the city of Midian, the Ruin mentioned in books, where longitude is sixty-one and latitude twenty-seven degrees fifty-two minutes. Between it and the sea is about fifty miles. In its valley is the path of the Hijazi caravan. The width of the sea at its coast is about a course. Above that place is the alignment of al-Qusayr from the western side. South of Midian and east of it, among the famous stations and mentioned ports, is al-Hawra. It was a place of landing and takeoff destroyed by the Arabs. It is where longitude is sixty-three degrees twenty minutes and latitude twenty-seven degrees forty-two minutes. South and west of it are the Islands of al-Ghul. They are small, exceeding a hundred islands. Naked blacks take refuge there, speaking a closed, heavy language. They have boats suitable for them and houses of reeds and grass. Their only livelihood is fish; they catch it and place it in seawater exposed to the sun. They salt that, then dry it and carry it as jerked meat to al-Tur and Suez, selling it to the Christians of Karak and Shawbak for raisins, oil, olives, and the like. Located in this part where longitude is sixty-four degrees fifty-six minutes and latitude twenty-seven degrees is the city of Khaybar, famous for the habitation of Jews. Its people are blacks who mention they are Muslims who were slaves of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him. The doctrine of the Jews is apparent in them. Between it and the Prophet's City (Medina) is Yanbu. It has springs, vegetables, and a fortress. It is the residence of the Banu al-Hasan, may Allah be pleased with him. Its location is where longitude is sixty-four degrees and latitude twenty-six degrees. It has a port on the Sea of Hijaz a stage away from it, where pilgrims intending for Medina land.",

    "text": "The location of the Prophet's City (Medina), upon its inhabitant be the best prayers and peace, is where longitude is sixty-five degrees twenty minutes and latitude twenty-five degrees thirty-one minutes. East of it are al-'Awali, which are part of the Sarawat mountains extending from the beginning of Yemen to Karak in the Levant. East and north of it lie the Mountains of Tayy, which are three, passed by the pilgrims of Kufa. The western one, the first, is where longitude is sixty-eight degrees and latitude at its southern head is twenty-eight degrees forty minutes. From there to the end of the Fourth Part are the domains of the clans of Tayy, which remain in Hijaz to our era. Part Five: The first thing you meet in it are the domains of Khafajah, who are the Arabs of Iraq in our era. Their raids are continuous on the lands that came under the administration of the Tatars. Whenever they pursued them, they entered the deserts in Hijaz. Then to its east are the domains of Banu 'Amir, Arabs of al-Yamamah and Bahrain. The city of Bahrain, capital of its famous lands, is located on the Persian Sea, where longitude is seventy-nine degrees and latitude twenty-five degrees thirty-one minutes. The sea enters the land from its two sides, and for that, it was known by this name (Two Seas). East of it is the Island of Awal (Bahrain Island), elongated from the beginning of the line of the Third Clime to where latitude is twenty-six degrees. It is narrow; its widest part is ten miles. Between it and Bahrain is about sixty miles. It has many remnants of the Qarmatians, and it was their center. North of it with the line of the Fourth Clime is the Island of Kharak (Kharg), famous for pearl diving. It is south of Jannabah, one of the cities of Fars. The center of this island is in the line of the Fourth Clime where longitude is seventy-eight degrees. It is one of the small islands not reaching twenty miles. East and south of it is the Island of Qays (Kish), famous among travelers. It has pearl diving, elites, and wealthy people, and from it come people of virtue. Its size is twelve miles, and its center is where longitude is eighty-three degrees and latitude twenty-seven degrees. East of it is the port of Kerman, famous on the tongues of travelers, which is the city of Hormuz on a salty inlet entered by ships from the Persian Sea. Its location is where longitude is eighty-four degrees and latitude twenty-eight degrees twenty minutes. Located in this part among the ports of Makran is Tiz, where longitude is eighty-six degrees and latitude twenty-six degrees twenty minutes. East of it, among the ports of Makran, is Kir. Between them on the coast is eighty miles. Then the city of Qanbali, where longitude is eighty-seven degrees fifty-five minutes and latitude twenty-four degrees forty-two minutes. The capital of Makran, the city of Firuz, is located where longitude is eighty-seven degrees and latitude twenty-six degrees sixty minutes. Part Six: The first thing you meet in it are the marshes of the Zutt. They are a nation of the commoners of Sindh; their nomads are proverbial for their weakness. Their homes are in huts like the foot soldiers of the Berbers on rivers and ponds originating from the River al-Birun. East of them is the city of al-Birun, to which Abu Rayhan al-Biruni, the master of ancient and modern sciences and student of Ibn Sina, is attributed. This city is one of the ports of the land of Sindh on their salty gulf exiting from the Persian Sea. The river attributed to it is east of it, pouring into the gulf; its source is from the mountains of Kabul connected to the mountains of Tukharistan, which are there the source of some rivers like Jayhun (Oxus) flowing north. The location of al-Birun is where longitude is seventy-one degrees fifty-two minutes. The gulf passes descending to the Second Clime where the city of Daybul is, mentioned previously. Then it stops with the line of the Third Clime, and the Great Mehran (Indus) pours into it there near Daybul. East of that, where longitude is ninety-five and a half degrees and latitude twenty-four degrees forty-two minutes, is the capital of Sindh, al-Mansura. The river is south of it, and a branch of Mehran surrounds it returning to it, so it becomes an island because of that. North of it lies the capital of Kabulistan, Kabul, to which the Kabul Myrobalan (Halilaj) is attributed. In its mountains are Indian drugs. It was one of the frontiers of Muslims facing India, and it has ended up with Sindh in the administration of the Tatars.",

    "text": "Its location is where longitude is one hundred degrees and latitude twenty-eight degrees. It has great cities and settlements. West of it is the Great City of Ghazna, where the throne of the Sultanate of Mahmud bin Sabuktegin, owner of the famous expeditions against the Indians, was. Then the Ghurid Sultans were there, who conquered many of the capitals of India. Remnants of their kingdoms remain until now in the city of Delhi; the Tatars could not overcome them. Islam is strong in their possession. Ghazna mentioned is located where longitude is ninety-two degrees fifty-one minutes and latitude twenty-eight degrees fifty-four minutes. It has obscure cities. Part Seven: The first thing you meet from the line of the Fourth Clime is the city of Qandabar (Gandhara/Kandahar?), one of the capitals of India, where longitude is one hundred and ten degrees. It is said to be one of the Alexandrias built by Alexander in the regions. When Muslims conquered it after Kabul, it became a frontier facing India. It is on the river attributed to it descending from the mountains attributed to it in its west. The river passes south of it, and an arm of it embraces it so it remains in the middle of the water. The small river descends into the big river which descends into Mehran. On the River Sindh in this part, and the mountains of the disbelieving Indians on its southern side and in its north, are obscure lands belonging to Muslims. The disbelieving Indians living under protection (Dhimma) were added to Qandabar. East of that are lands of disbelieving India until entering the lands of Hindustan conquered by Ghiyath al-Din al-Ghuri, ruler of Ghazna, and his brother Shihab al-Din. The first of the famous thrones of kings is Yafun (Badayun?). It has a deputy of authority from the Sultan of Delhi. It is where longitude is one hundred and twenty-three degrees and latitude twenty-six degrees fifteen minutes. It has obscure lands. Its subjects are disbelieving Indians and the soldiers are Muslim Turks. The waters of these lands are ponds of rainwater they call Balahat. Part Eight: The first thing you meet in it is the land of Hasi (Hansi), whose capital is in the Fourth Clime. East of it is the capital of Ballhara, King of Kings of India, the city of Qannauj, which Sultan Mahmud raided and frequented over a march of three months. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and thirty-one degrees fifty minutes and latitude twenty-nine degrees. It is between two arms of the River Ganges, venerated by Indians, becoming an island by them. On the sides of this river, in its descent from there to the Indian Ocean, are castles of the Brahmins that are not seen (impregnable?). They are the worshippers of India attributed to Brahman, the first of their wise men and sultans for whom the kingdoms and religions of India gathered. They do not see fit to eat what has a soul. Idols are with them. One among them becomes immortal in this world because he purified and spiritualized himself and deserved that. They have supernatural feats in this regard. Their worship revolves around the dancing of bondmaids and their playing in the temples. Whoever wants to draw near to them burns himself or enters the mentioned River Ganges. There are bamboo trees of extreme height and men arranged with drawn swords and upright daggers. Some devotees tie their head to the end of a bamboo then bend their neck, so the head comes down and the bamboo rises on the river bank. Another throws himself from a high place onto those swords and daggers and is cut up. Another drowns himself in the river. They claim this river is from Paradise, and that if filth is placed in it, its atmosphere darkens and its corners fill with winds, rains, and thunderbolts. Sultan Mahmud tested that at the 'Awzak pass and found it true. Seek that in the Yamini History authored by Abu Nasr al-Utbi regarding his expedition. Famous among the cities on this river in this part is 'Aws. It is on its west on the main road taken by Muslim merchants on the coast of the Maknunat to Delhi. Its inhabitants are disbelieving Indians but they have a policy regarding the passage of merchants over them. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and thirty-three degrees and latitude twenty-seven and a half degrees. From the east of this river to the end of this part are the mountains of Ballhara, containing many obscure Indian lands. This kingdom is to them the greatest of Indian kingdoms, and all their kings submit to its ruler. In it are many elephants and rhinoceroses that cut off roads so only groups traverse them. It is said that pepper grows in its watercourses where no one reaches it, and floods take it, so it is picked up and dried.",

    "text": "Part Nine: Passes in the mountains of Ballhara to where longitude is one hundred and forty-nine degrees, then enters Qaqula, whose capital was previously mentioned. Its mountains in this part connect from its west to the mountain separating it from the land of al-Hanbah. East of this mountain lies the city of Atragha. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and thirty-five degrees and latitude twenty-seven degrees forty minutes. It consists of four cities on the river attributed to it and on the two arms exiting from it. The source of this river is from the large mountain in its west near the line of the Fourth Clime where longitude is fifty-two degrees. It passes from there to the South, and on its sides are settlements of al-Hanbah until it pours into the Indian Ocean. In the city of Atragha is the king of these lands named al-Hanbah. South of Atragha is the mountain attributed to it, extending until it connects to the Mountain of China. Mountains branch from it containing many Indian drugs and many elephants. North of this mountain and east of Atragha is the Lake of the Four Cities; it is large and round. Its center is where longitude is one hundred and fifty-six degrees and latitude twenty-six and a half degrees. Its length equals its width, two degrees. The Great Gate of China, constructed with masonry, is located with the Large Mountain where longitude is sixty degrees [sic, likely 160] and its latitude with the line of the Fourth Clime. East of it at the end of the part with the line of the Fourth Clime is the capital of China, the city of Tajah, containing the Baghbur, their great king. From the Large Mountain north of it descends Khamdan, the largest river of China. The city becomes an island between its arms. Two rivers descend from it; a river passes in this part to the South until it pours into the Indian Ocean, and the greatest branch takes East in Part Ten. Part Ten: The first thing you meet in it in the land of China is the River Khamdan flowing East, then pouring into a large lake into which small rivers pour from the Mountain of China. Then the Great River Khamdan exits from its south, having grown large, passing in the Third Clime and beyond to the end behind the Equator, in the deserts surrounding this lake near and far from the settlements of China. Its obscure cities are many. Mentioned here is Siniyah, the ancient capital where the Sultan used to be. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and sixty-seven degrees and latitude twenty-six degrees and minutes. It is on the east of a river descending from the Mountain of China, on which are many settlements. In this city, Chinese pottery is made; clay is brought for it from a land with much silver in eastern China. It is said its maker does not benefit from it; only his heir benefits. East of this city is the Mountain of Sin-Sin separating it from China. East of this mountain, from Sin-Sin of obscure names, is what has been neglected in books and on tongues. The Capital is located there, the city of Manzi (Hangzhou/Lin'an?), which the Tatars could not overcome by trickery nor siege, where longitude is one hundred and ninety-six degrees thirty minutes and latitude twenty-six degrees. It is on a continuous river descending from the mentioned mountain passing east and widening greatly, then mixing at the end of habitation with the Surrounding Ocean. Many rivers descend to it from the Great Northern Mountain, on which are settlements of Sin-Sin. Manzi silk is the ultimate in goodness. Fourth Clime: Ibn Fatimah said: It is to them the most moderate of climes and best in animals and plants. Explanation of this is lengthy. It is the middle of the Seven Climes, and the best of matters is the middle. Its inhabitants are between whiteness, redness, brownness, and yellowness. Since the Third Clime is to its south and the Fifth Clime to its north, moderation is judged for them and a resemblance to the Fourth appears in them. The width of this Fourth Clime is thirty-six degrees, and its extent from its south to its north is six degrees nineteen minutes.",

    "text": "Part One: Located in it are the four Islands of Happiness as drawn. The Surrounding Ocean in it ends ascending eastward where longitude is six degrees. There, at its beginning, is the mouth of the River Nul. On it are many settlements of Lamta; it is famous. North of it, among the famous ports, is Samtamat. It is a fortress on a cape protruding into the sea, cut off from the mainland by water. Longitude is six and latitude twenty-six and a quarter degrees. Sailors say between it and the river mouth is fifty miles. North of it pours the River Masat; on it is the famous Ribat (fortress/monastery) where the righteous take refuge. Between the two places is sixty miles. From the mouth of this river to the mouth of the River Sus, where sugar cane grows, is twelve miles. Between it and Agadir al-Tarf—the edge of the great Mount Daran entering the sea—is six miles. From there to the mouth of the river [...] is sixty miles; it is in the land of Hahah. From it, salt is shipped to those coasts south and north. From this river to the mouth of the River Amgaddul (Mogador) is forty miles; it is also in the land of Hahah. There is a small island with a mile between it and the river; there is a winter anchorage for ships. From this river to the mouth of the River Tansift, which passes north of Marrakesh, is eighteen miles. There is the port of Aghmat. Between it and the port of Marrakesh, now famous as the city of Safi (Asfi), is thirty-two miles. It is the end of the Clime on an entering bay; longitude there is seven degrees and latitude thirty degrees. North of the city is a cape entering the sea for forty miles called Kansuli, which ships guard against. Located in it is the city of al-Sus, named Taroudant, on the river from the northern side, where longitude is eight degrees and latitude twenty-six degrees twenty minutes. It has many obscure settlements. Its river, the River Masat, and the River Nul all come from the South and East from Mount Lamta connected to Mount Gazula in the Second Clime. It passes in this Third Clime to Sijilmasa. South of it is Mount Sartah; they are like Saltah, tribes of the veiled Berbers. It exits from the Second Clime east of Daran to west of Sijilmasa. West of it by two stages is the city of Draa... Its location is where longitude is eleven degrees six minutes and latitude twenty-five degrees ten minutes. Its famous river to its west descends from red hills at Mount Daran. It is a journey of seven days in continuous settlements. Most of what grows on it is Henna carried to the Maghreb regions until what remains of it sinks into the desert of the Second Clime. East of Draa is the city of Sijilmasa, a famous provincial capital where longitude is thirteen degrees twenty-two minutes and latitude twenty-six degrees twenty-four minutes. Its river comes from the South and East, its source from Mount Azru, which has many snakes, and from its springs. It divides from there into two parts, then the two parts meet and connect on its west and east. It has eight gates; wherever you exit from it, you see the river, palm trees, and other trees. This river pours into the River Ziz, which runs with it and the river of Sijilmasa to it for five days in settlements and bounties. Then the River Ziz pours into the River Moulouya, which pours into the Sea of the Romans (Mediterranean). Connected to Mount Azru are the mountains of Sanhaja; they are many, cohesive, and winding. This tribe is the largest of the Berber tribes; in every land, there is a multitude of them. They mention their origin is from the Arabs of Yemen, and Arabism is apparent among them. Among their mountains is their capital, the city of Takla, where longitude is twelve degrees and latitude thirty degrees. Connected from its west to the Surrounding Ocean is the great famous Mount Daran (High Atlas), where the land of the Masmuda lies; they are known as the Almohads who ruled the Berbers. First in it from the East is the land of Haskurah, then west of it the land of Hazrajah, then the land of Harghah, the tribe of the Mahdi (Ibn Tumart). Most of them claim they are from the descendants of Al-Hussein bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them. West of them is the land of Hintatah, the tribe of Sheikh Abu Hafs, the greatest of the Almohad sheikhs; the authority of Ifriqiya is now in his progeny. They attribute themselves to Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him. West of them is the land of Tinmal, the fortress which no creature has a way against due to its being cut off by cliffs and abysses from all sides. No one crosses to it except on a bridge lifted during war. West of it is Kadmiwah and the land of Janfisah. West of it is the land of Hahah, distinguished by white honey and large good oxen, just as Tinmal is distinguished by oil preferred in all the Maghreb. West of it is the land of Ragragah, distinguished by a tree whose oil was preferred over what is pressed from olives, and its scent is fragrant. In it, cloths of utmost fineness and softness are made, with which the women of the capital wrap themselves. In it is the River Shafshawah, having large good pomegranates. This land is connected to the Surrounding Ocean. North of Mount Daran is Aghmat...",

    "text": "Its location is where its southern half is in the Fourth Clime and the northern half is in the Fifth Clime, and its longitude is close to Tangier. Opposite Ksar al-Majaz from Andalusia is Tarifa. In front of it in the sea is a small island known to travelers as the Island of Tarifa (Isla de las Palomas), just as we say the Green Island (Algeciras). But it is in front of Ceuta on the Andalusian mainland; however, in its direction is a green island known by it. In front of this city to its south is the famous Mountain of Conquest (Jabal al-Fath) from which Andalusia was conquered. This is how people know it. Its name in books is Jabal Tariq (Gibraltar). He is the freedman of Musa bin Nusayr, conqueror of Andalusia. This mountain appears in the sea from Ceuta, being high in the sea. Between it and the Green Island (Algeciras) is the famous harbor where ships of Ceuta and others anchor, for the storm has no way against them. The sea from east of Ceuta comes south, passing close to the line of the Fifth Clime by the Island of Andalusia. The first thing you meet in the Mainland (North Africa) after Ceuta is Mount Ghomara, high and wide, containing nations counted only by Allah Almighty. From it, cedar wood is carried, from which fleets are constructed, known in royal buildings and carried to the horizons. Between it and Ceuta is twenty-six miles, and to the River Law descending from it ten miles; it is large, entered by ships sailing in it to the city of Badis (Velez de la Gomera). It is one of the most famous ports of Ghomara, and that coast is known as the Rif. From Badis to Al-Mazamma is like what is between Badis and Ceuta, one hundred miles. It is a famous port. From it to the city of Melilla is one hundred miles. On its east at ten miles pours the great famous River Moulouya, into which the River Ziz descends, and into which the River Sijilmasa descends. Thus, its distance from the source of Sijilmasa in the South is about one hundred miles. From it to Archgul (Rachgoun), the port of Tlemcen and where the river into which the great River Yisser pours, is seventy miles. From it to the port of Honaine is twelve miles. From it to the famous port of Oran is eighty miles. It is the last port of this part of the Mainland cities. Its harbor is famous, safe in terror (storms). Opposite the city of Badis from the Andalusian mainland is Malaga. It is with the line of the Fifth Clime, and the width of the sea between them is a degree. From it, Malaga figs and almonds are carried to regions. Opposite Al-Mazamma is the port of Almunecar; it is with the mentioned Line on the coast of Granada; the width of the sea there is a course. Opposite Archgul is the city of Almeria, famous for having the Arsenal of Andalusia and its Diwan. It is also with the mentioned Line. In it, and in Malaga and Murcia, silk clothes embroidered with gold of strange craftsmanship are made. The width of the sea there is two degrees. The famous Tlemcen is located where longitude is fourteen degrees forty minutes and latitude thirty-three degrees forty-two minutes. Between it and Archgul is twenty miles. Between it and Honaine is thirty miles. It is now the capital of Banu Abd al-Wad of Zenata. From it, woolen clothes preferred over their kind made in the rest of the Maghreb are carried. From it are carried bits, horses, saddles, and related items. Andalusians say it is like one of the cities of Andalusia due to its waters, orchards, and abundance of its industries. West of it with a deviation to the South lies the city of Rabat where longitude is twelve degrees and latitude thirty-three degrees minus ten minutes. West of it is the city of Fez where longitude is ten degrees sixty minutes and latitude thirty-three degrees. It is one of the distinct cities of the Maghreb filled with bounties and strange industries. It is said there are springs in it numbering the days of the year. Its river coming from the meadow in its east irrigates it and pours into the River Sebou passing its north. East of Fez is Mount Madyun extending south, where Madyun burnouses that rain does not penetrate are made. This mountain mixes from its south with Mount Daran and from its north with the mountains of Taza and mountains of Ghomara. From the mountains south of Fez, the River Sabak descends. From them and south of this river, the River Umm Rabi' descends. From the mountains north of Fez, the River Yisser descends. All pour into the Surrounding Ocean as drawn. North of Fez is the famous city of Meknes, abundant in olives. Descending from the mountains of Ghomara in its east is the River Fulful, passing its south and pouring into the River Sebou. Between it and Fez is forty miles. West of it with a deviation to the North is the city of Ksar (Alcazarquivir), known as Ksar Abd al-Karim and Ksar Kutama, who are nomads. The location of this city is where longitude is eight and a half degrees and latitude thirty-four degrees forty minutes. It is on the north of the river attributed to it. Between it and Ceuta is four days. Between River Salé and River Sebou are mountains...",

It is now the capital of Maghzawa of Zenata. Its location is where longitude is eighteen degrees twelve minutes and latitude thirty-three degrees twenty minutes. It has a river coming from its south pouring into the sea to its east; between it and the sea is two miles. East of it is Mostaganem, one of the ports of Maghzawa; between them is sixty miles. East of it pours the River Chelif previously mentioned. The width of the sea there to the coast of Denia in Andalusia is about three and a half courses. East of it is the city of Algiers (Al-Jaza'ir). It is a famous port under the administration of Bejaia, where longitude is twenty degrees eighteen minutes and latitude thirty-three and a half degrees. East of it is Dellys (Tadallas) at fifty miles from it; it is a famous port. East of it is the capital of the Central West, Bejaia (Bougie), where longitude is twenty-two degrees and latitude thirty-four degrees fifteen minutes. It has a river of utmost beauty with orchards and parks on its banks, where ship owners recreate. It pours into the sea to its east; its source is from the direction of Shaqra in the southern desert. The width of the sea at Bejaia to the direction of Tortosa in Andalusia is three courses. On the coast east of Bejaia are the Mountains of Mercy (Jibal al-Rahmah); ships endure severe terror in its sea. Its inhabitants are rebellious Berbers; their land is fortified containing cotton and figs. East of it is Collo (Al-Qull). It is a famous port on the coast of Constantine of the Air (Qusantinah al-Hawa); between them is forty miles. The location of Constantine is to its south, where longitude is twenty-six degrees forty minutes and latitude thirty-three degrees twenty-two minutes. It has a river pouring into its great eastern trench; a terrifying echo is heard from it circling from the top of the city to the bottom of the trench like the tail of a star due to the distance. This city is at the end of the Sultanate of Bejaia. The first of the Sultanate of Ifriqiya on the sea is the city of Bone (Annaba), where longitude is twenty-eight degrees and latitude thirty-three degrees fifty minutes. It has a medium river pouring into the sea to its west. East of it is Marsa al-Kharaz (La Calle/El Kala), distinguished by coral. In front of it in the sea in this part is Sardinia, the famous island where coral is found. It is a petrified tree in the sea coming out white and soft; if the air hits it, it turns red and hard. The city of this port is where longitude is twenty-nine degrees and minutes, and latitude approximates the latitude of Bone. East of it, among the mentioned ports, is Tabarka, from where wood and good Persian reed are carried to the Tunisian capital. East of it is the city of Bizerte (Binzart), where longitude is thirty degrees sixty minutes and latitude thirty-three and a half degrees. It has a river with a lighthouse pouring into its east. It has a sweet lake in its south and a salty lake in its east; each pours into the other for six months, so neither the sweet spoils with the salt nor the salt improves with the sweet. It is widely known that fish exit these two lakes at the beginning of every month as a known species, and the first species disappears until the year turns. East of it is Ras al-Jabal (Cape of the Mountain), where the safe anchorage is in winter. Ships resort to it from the port of Tunis if there is terror (storm) or repair is intended. Between this mountain and Tunis pours the River Medjerda, famous in Ifriqiya; it is called al-Mafza' at its mouth. The Capital named Tunis is located where longitude is thirty-two degrees and latitude thirty-three degrees thirty-one minutes. It is on a salty lake entered by small ships with cargo from large ships anchoring in its harbor. Between the shore of the lake at Tunis and its mouth at the sea is ten miles, and its circumference is twenty-four miles. This city is now the capital of Ifriqiya, and most lands of the Maghreb are subordinate to it. East of it is Kelibia (Iqlibiyah), a fortress on the sea; between them is about ninety miles. The sea turns from its east to its south where the city of Hammamet is at the head of that inlet, near Tunis by land, but a large detour by sea. East of Kelibia at sixty miles in the sea is the Island of Pantelleria (Qawsarah), from which dried figs and cotton are brought, and it has mastic. It belongs to Muslims under a pact with the Franks of Sicily; between them is a course. Most of Sicily is in the Fifth Clime. East of Hammamet on the coast is the city of Sousse (Susa). From it, Muslims conquered the Island of Sicily. It is where longitude is thirty-four degrees and minutes and latitude thirty-two degrees forty minutes. East of it in an inlet to the South is the city of Mahdia, built by Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi and made the capital of Ifriqiya. It is elongated into the sea...",

East of it is the city of Sfax. In front of it is the Short (shallow water) which large ships do not enter; its length from Kaboudia to east of Sfax is about eighty miles. At its end in the North in the Great Sea is the Island of Kerkennah, where fine [...] is made, and it has raisins superior to the Djerbian; it belongs to Muslims, located thirty miles from Sfax. Sfax is located where longitude is thirty-five degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees sixty minutes. East and south of it, with the end of the Second Part and end of the Third Clime, is the city of Gabes, which is in Ifriqiya like Damascus in the Levant. Two rivers descend to it from the mountain in its south, piercing its Ghouta (oasis/garden), and its streams branch over it. It is distinguished among the lands of Ifriqiya by bananas; it has abundant good fresh dates, tiger nuts (Hab 'Aziz), and Henna. Between it and the sea is three miles, and medium ships enter its river. The Great Mountain extends from it East and West being in its south, striking in its direction Mount Dammar, in the direction of Gafsa Mount Aures, and in the direction of Kairouan Mount Ousselat. It is fertile in all these places; sultanate monies are collected from it. The city of Kairouan is located south of this mountain where longitude is thirty-three degrees and latitude thirty-one degrees. It is in the desert suitable for Arab camels. It was the capital of Ifriqiya in early Islam and is now subordinate to Tunis. Connected to Mount Ousselat are mountains inhabited by varieties of Berber subjects. South of it is the desert, and north of it are domains of 'Awf of the Arabs and domains of Nafzawa and Hawwara of the Berbers. In the direction of Beja at fifty miles from Tunis are domains of Hudhayl; they are reckoned horsemen in Ifriqiya. Then connects to that the famous Mount Aures where al-Kahinah (The Priestess) was. Its inhabitants are people of villainy and disobedience who do not enter under the obedience of a sultan due to the impregnability of their wide long mountain, and due to what they have of tricks, foot soldiers, and weapons. It has abundant goods; its people are Kharijites, mostly from Lawata, a large multitude included in the subjects. Between this mountain and the city of Bone are domains for the Arabs. From the border of Constantine to Bejaia are domains of Riyah. From west of Bejaia to Tlemcen are domains of Rahibah, connected to the Mountains of Ouarsenis previously mentioned. In the First Part is the mountain of Banu Rashid, who are of Zenata, having known production in horses. In this part branch the mountains of Sanhaja, Zwawa, and others, mentioning which would be lengthy.",

Between it and the mainland is a narrow strait crossed by boats. Between this strait and Gabes is a stage. The length of this island is a stage, and its inhabitants are Kharijites (Ibadi). North of it is the Island of Lampedusa; it is empty, ships resort to it and water from it. North of it lies Sicily. East and south of Djerba, the sea recedes to the North until the famous city of Tripoli (Tarabulus) is located on it where longitude is thirty-eight degrees and latitude thirty-two degrees twenty minutes. East of it by two stages is Mount Nafusa, connected to Mount Dammar and connected mountains until Mount Daran which enters the Surrounding Ocean. Its length is six days and width three days. In it are cities, settlements, a large multitude, waters, and fertility. From it, Tripoli is supplied with varieties of goods, even vegetables and fruits. In it are olives, oil, raisins, and dates. Mountains connect to it until it cuts off east of the city of Leptis (Labdah) the Ruin. The ruins of this city of marble and Heraclean stones testify to its former state. It is on the sea where longitude is thirty-nine degrees thirty minutes, and latitude close to the latitude of Tripoli. The domains of Dhiyab are from the border of Gabes to Bir al-Sidra of Barqa. After Leptis, the sea begins entering to the South. On its coast there are settlements for clans of Hawwara under the protection of Dhiyab. In summary, once you leave Tripoli, you do not meet a city with a bath or baker until you reach Alexandria. At the end of the sea's ascent to the South is Qasr Ahmad, the last border of Ifriqiya where longitude is forty-one degrees twenty-two minutes and latitude with the line of the Fourth Clime. At its latitude are the castles of Misrata, extending twelve miles on olives and palms. Its people are of Hawwara under the protection of Dhiyab. They have a passion for carrying horses to Alexandria. Pilgrims find aid from them on that arduous road. The first thing you meet from the border of Barqa is the Gulf of Radiq mentioned, and what follows has been mentioned in the Third Clime. East of it is Bir al-Sidra, the first of the domains of the Arabs to the Small Aqaba of the land of Alexandria. Located in the land inlet between the Gulf of Radiq and Ras al-Tin is Tolmeita (Ptolemais). It is a famous port there, containing a castle with Jews under Arab protection.",

In the East is the city of Barqa, which was the capital of the Barqan lands, destroyed by the Arabs. It is called today the City of al-Marj. Between it and Tolmeita is ten miles. The fertility of Barqa containing trees and goods is in the inlet to its south; its distance is about ten stages from West to East. Whoever protects it from the Arabs of Hayt has the power. From its mountains descends the River Derna and pours into the Salt Sea. I did not see in all the lands of Barqa a river other than it. South of it is the desolate desert. Derna is located where longitude is forty-six degrees and latitude thirty-five degrees seventeen minutes. It was one of the mentioned cities of Barqa, destroyed by the Arabs. It is now counted among the Arab castles to which Jews and their agents resort. On its coast is Ras Awthan (Cape of Idols), where sailors congratulate themselves. It is located in the corner where longitude is forty-four degrees and latitude thirty-four degrees fifty-two minutes. East of it is the famous Hilal (Crescent), a mountain appearing from afar in the sea to the right of the Island of Crete located in the Fifth Clime. Between it and Ras Awthan is two stages. East of Derna is the famous Ras al-Tin (Cape of Figs). It is in the eastern corner, just as Ras Awthan is in the western corner. Its location is where longitude is thirty-five degrees minus minutes. From there, the sea takes forty-six degrees forty-seven minutes [sic, likely describing curvature] and latitude ascending to the South. South of it, among famous ports, is al-Qurashi, then Tobruk (Tabruq). It was the capital of the land in the days of the Romans. The land was known as Pentapolis (Antabulus). The Arabs named it Barqa when they saw the abundance of stones mixed with sand. Tobruk has a harbor that rarely has an equal on this sea; winds have no way against it, as if it were a basin hollowed in stone. Remnants of this city's walls indicate its antiquity. It is where longitude is forty-seven degrees twenty-two minutes and latitude thirty-two degrees fifty minutes. In its direction is the course known as al-Bantan. East of that, among castles famous to the Arabs, are Lakk and Qumar. East of them is the Great Aqaba, the first of the Egyptian lands. There is Marsa al-Muslim (Port of the Muslim), one of the mentioned ports. The Aqaba is where longitude is forty-nine degrees and latitude thirty-two degrees. There is the famous Hawwara Inlet, an inlet in the sea. North of it is the famous Port of Churches (Marsa al-Kana'is). From there are domains of Hawwara, then domains of [...] to the end of the Lake. The famous Alexandria, the link between the Indian Ocean and the Sea of the Romans, lies where longitude is fifty-one degrees twenty minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees thirty-one minutes. It has two seas like Ceuta and Mahdia. Except that Alexandria is separated at its ends by the Cape protruding in front of it. In it is the famous Lighthouse (Pharos) by which ships guide themselves by day and by its light at night. Its height in our time is eighty-four fathoms. The height of the minaret of Seville is thirty-five fathoms. The height of the minaret of Marrakesh is thirty-six fathoms. The height of Pompey's Pillar (Amud al-Sawari) in Alexandria is one hundred cubits and its circumference forty spans. Alexandria has a canal in its south into which water enters from the Nile during the flood days, so ships come to it from all Egyptian coasts with varieties of crops and goods. If this canal is disabled, the lake in its east operates. It is salty; sea water enters it between Alexandria and Rosetta, and ships travel in it to the lands on the Nile. Forty miles from Alexandria is Tarujah. It is in the South with a tilt to the West. Arabs of Beheira and Arabs of Barqa shop there, and it is famous for that. Taruji grapes are of utmost goodness and appearance. It is said there was a city west of it where the people of Egypt met Al-Mu'izz the Ubaydi when he came from Ifriqiya, then it was ruined by strife. East and south of Alexandria at fifty miles is Damanhur, the capital of Beheira. It has a canal from the canal of Alexandria. Arabs of Beheira shop there most. Rosetta (Rashid) lies on the west of the Nile at its mouth in the sea, where longitude is fifty-two degrees four minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees sixty minutes. East of it is Lake Nastaruh (Burullus?). No lake in the Egyptian lands yields more revenue than it; it reached twenty-five thousand Egyptian Dinars in our time, while other Egyptian lakes guarantee seventy thousand Dinars. East of it is the Ribat of al-Burlus. From it, the sea turns South, so famous Damietta is located on the mouth...",

Al-Mansura, built in our time as a fortress on the canal of Ashmun branching from the Eastern Nile which pours into Lake Tinnis, lies where longitude is fifty-three and a half degrees and latitude thirty-one degrees minus minutes. [Repetition of previous text]. Part Four: The first thing you meet in it is Lake Tinnis east of Damietta. The city of Tinnis, to which high-quality clothes are attributed, lies inside this lake on an island where longitude is fifty-four degrees forty minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees thirty minutes. East of this lake on the Salt Sea is Farama the Ruin, where longitude is fifty-four degrees fifty minutes and latitude thirty-two degrees. Remaining between the Sea of the Romans—which is the Sea of Coral—and the Indian Ocean—which is the Sea of Pearls—is an isthmus about seventy miles. Amr bin al-As wanted to pierce what is between the two seas from the direction of al-Qulzum in a place now known as the Tail of the Crocodile (Dhanab al-Timsah), but Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, forbade him lest pilgrims be snatched at the Sanctuary. East of Farama is Al-Arish; it was a formidable city on the sand road, where longitude is fifty-six and a half degrees and latitude thirty-two degrees thirty minutes. East of it is Gaza, called Gaza of Hashim. They claim the grandfather of the Prophet, peace be upon him, is buried there. It is said Imam al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, is from there. It is where longitude is fifty-seven degrees and minutes. From there the sea twists to the West and North, so Ascalon (Asqalan) is in an inlet where longitude is fifty-five degrees twenty minutes and latitude thirty-four degrees fifty minutes. It is on the sea, while Gaza has sand dunes between it and the sea. After Ascalon is Jaffa, one of the famous ports, where longitude is fifty-six degrees and latitude thirty-four degrees. Then on the coast is Caesarea where longitude is fifty-seven degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-three degrees fifteen minutes. Then lies the city of Acre ('Akka), the stirrup of the Franks and gathering place of their merchants and pilgrims, where longitude is fifty-eight degrees and latitude thirty-three degrees twenty minutes. Tyre (Sur), which cannot be aspired to by siege from land, lies where longitude is fifty-nine degrees seventeen minutes and latitude thirty-three degrees forty minutes. The Franks dug around it until they wanted it to be [surrounded by] the sea. Beirut, the port of Damascus, lies where longitude is fifty-nine degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-four degrees. Tripoli lies on the sea where longitude is sixty-one degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude thirty-four degrees. Latakia lies on the sea where longitude is sixty-one degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude thirty-four degrees thirty-one minutes. Famous Antioch lies where longitude is sixty-one degrees thirty-five minutes and latitude thirty-four degrees ten minutes. Between it and the sea is al-Suwaydiyah (Saint Simeon) at the mouth of the Orontes River (al-'Asi) descending from the direction of Baalbek, passing north of Homs, Hama, and Shaizar, then east and north of Antioch to the Sea of the Romans. Then it twists to the North, forming the Gulf of Armenians. Famous cities on it lie in the first latitude of this part. First is al-Massisah (Mopsuestia) on the River Sayhan where longitude is fifty-nine degrees fifty minutes and latitude thirty-six degrees; between it and the sea is twelve miles. North of it is Adana north of the River Sayhan; between the two cities is twenty miles, and likewise between Adana and the sea. North of it is the capital of the land of Sis: Tarsus. It is on both sides of its river, which pours into the sea at twelve miles. Between it and Adana is twenty miles. It is where longitude is fifty-eight degrees and latitude thirty-six degrees seventeen minutes. Sis is a city created by Ibn Leo (Levon), King of the Armenians, and he made it the capital of his kingdom.",

The first southern landmarks in Part Four is al-Tih (Wilderness of Wandering), spanning four stages, left by the Egyptian caravan on its left when travelling from al-Qulzum to al-Tur. Mount al-Tur (Sinai) on the Sea of Qulzum is east of Bahr al-Ghazal where longitude is fifty-seven degrees twenty minutes. Eilat lies at the head of its inlet exiting from the Sea of Qulzum, where longitude is fifty-eight degrees forty minutes and latitude thirty degrees fifty minutes. It was a Jewish capital, then ruined. North of it is the arduous Aqaba attributed to it; the rider travels from its beginning to its end a full stage. North of it lies Shawbak where longitude is fifty-seven degrees and latitude thirty-one degrees. Famous Karak lies north of it where longitude is fifty-six degrees fifty minutes and latitude thirty-one and a half degrees. There in Mu'tah is the grave of Ja'far al-Tayyar and his companions; it has a valley with water and orchards. Jerusalem (al-Quds) lies where longitude is fifty-six degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude thirty-two degrees. Between it and Karak is the Dead Sea, tilting east from it. No living thing exists in it. In it is found the place of [...] and in interpretations, it is the homes of the people of Lot which were swallowed by the earth. The known Jordan River exits Lake Tiberias and passes through the Ghor until it pours into this Dead Sea. People say it has an outlet to the Sea of Qulzum. Tiberias, which was the capital of Jund al-Urdunn, lies where longitude is fifty-seven degrees forty-five minutes. In its direction is the lake attributed to it, between it and Acre and Tyre. A river descends to it from Lake Qadush above it, and the Jordan River exits from it. In Tiberias are hot springs sufficing its people from baths. The city was ruined by the conflict of the two religions over it. It is now, with Ascalon, Jaffa, and Caesarea, in Muslim possession. Mount 'Amil extends east and south of the coast until near Tyre. On it is al-Shaqif (Beaufort Castle), regained for Muslims in our time. Its subjects were under Frankish rule, then returned to Muslim rule and entered the soldiers' fiefs. East and south of it is Mount 'Awf; its people were rebels, so Usama built the fortress of Ajloun over them until they entered obedience. East and south of it is Mount al-Salt; its people were also rebels, so al-Mu'azzam built the fortress of al-Salt over them until they entered obedience. Between it and Ajloun is two stages, likewise between it and Karak. The Ghor (Jordan Valley) is long; sugar cane and bananas grow well in it. Its end is Jericho at the beginning of the Dead Sea; it was a city of the Giants (Jabbarin) and is now formidable. Between this Ghor and the coast is the Ghor of Beisan. Whoever takes the left road travels over Nablus, whose mountain is a pilgrimage and Qibla for the Samaritans, and Mount al-Sharah south of al-Balqa. Behind it is wilderness, inhabited now by farmers. In the direction of [...] from which the Abbasids emerged to the Caliphate in Iraq. In that southern line is al-Azraq, a fortress built by al-Mu'azzam at the edge of the wilderness containing the road to Hijaz. On the right of the road are al-Ula and Tabuk, and on the left the road of Tayma. North of al-Azraq is Bosra, capital of Hauran, four stages from Damascus. East of it in the southern line is Salkhad, capital of the mountain of Banu Hilal. The capital of the Levant, Damascus, lies where longitude is sixty degrees and latitude thirty-four degrees. In astrolabes it is thirty-three degrees like Baghdad and Tunis. The abundance of snow in it is only from the mountains in their directions where snow never leaves. It is said the gardens of the world are four: Samarkand, Shi'b Bawwan, the Ubulla (canal), and the Ghouta of Damascus. Abu Bakr al-Khwarizmi said: The Ghouta surpasses these three and all gardens of the world. Baalbek lies west and north of it, forty miles away. In it are great monuments of long trellis stones. Snow is abundant there. It is known as al-Salihin. Snowy mountains extend towards Homs. Between it and the sea is Mount al-Khayt inhabited by permissivist (Ibahiya) folks; they often sell Muslims to Franks if they pass by them. Connected to them towards Wadi al-Taym is [...] famous, a stage from Damascus. Mount Sikkin extends, where the Ismaili mission spreads and their fortresses Masyaf and al-Khaf al-Hawani are, between Homs and Hama towards the sea. At its edge towards Baalbek and Homs is Crac des Chevaliers (Hisn al-Akrad), said to produce intoxicating wine. West of Crac des Chevaliers is [...] conquered by Muslims. Connected to the Ismaili mountain, and on their doctrine, is Mount Summaq of the work of Aleppo. It is full of Ismailis.

They claim the sun stopped for Ali, may Allah sanctify his soul, as it stopped for Joshua, and the skull spoke to him as it spoke to Christ; they went to extremes in deifying him. Their doctrine is common in the Island of 'Ana at the edge of Jazira (Mesopotamia) bordering Iraq. In the Nusayri mountain to the north: Sahyun (Saone), famous for pleasure (Mut'ah), is nearby. The location of Homs, a capital of the Junds of the Levant, is where longitude is sixty-one degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude thirty-four degrees. Hama is a stage from Homs, one of the pleasantest cities of the Levant. The Orontes River is north of it, having waterwheels (Norias) and gardens; boats frequent it between orchards. Then from it to Ma'arrat (al-Nu'man) is a stage. It is famous for abundant olives, figs, and pistachios. In it is a column moved by a child so it tilts, due to engineering beneath it. In it is the grave of Joshua peace be upon him. Outside it is the Monastery of Simon (Deir Sim'an) under the grave of Umar bin Abd al-Aziz, exposed to the sky as he bequeathed. In the South is Khanasir where he resided during his Caliphate; it is a desert city. Likewise Salamiyah, whose people frequent Hama. From it Abdullah al-Mahdi emerged and established his mission in the Maghreb, then his sons succeeded in the Caliphate over Egypt and the Levant until Sultan Salah al-Din bin Ayyub removed their state. From Ma'arrat to Qinnasrin is a large stage. It was the capital of a Jund of the Levant, then weakened by Aleppo's strength and ruined by the Franks' entry and seizure of its regions. It is now a village; below it the River Quwayq pours into a large lake. The hill of Qinnasrin overlooks it. The plain extends from there to Aleppo, a small stage. This famous city, which grew huge with the Hamdanid state in it, then the Arab and non-Arab states that succeeded over it until the Tatars entered it in our time, destroyed it, and inhabited its people's homes, lies where longitude is sixty-three degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-four degrees thirty minutes. It is south and east of the River Quwayq, which comes from the direction of Azaz, a famous fortress north of Aleppo. This city has regions of utmost beauty, goodness, and fertility. Most of its soil is red, pleasing the soul. Mostly cotton is grown there, carried in ships to Ceuta spreading through the Maghreb lands. Its land is fertile with large pistachios. One of the pleasantest dwellings in its region is al-Bab, more beautiful than an eye sees or a soul finds rest in. There is the fountain mentioned by Imru' al-Qais in his poetry, and the valley described wondrously by al-Manari. In this place is a city, though not famous; it has a bath, cloth merchants, and perfumers. It is a good stage from Aleppo on the Euphrates road. In the northern direction is the River al-Jawz, one of the best rivers of the world, most abundant in goods and thickest in shade.",

It is distinguished by the known spring and the thatch which has no equal; they cannot transport it to Aleppo because it turns into water on the way. Between Aleppo and Antioch is Harim, a fortress of much provision, distinguished by pomegranates whose inside shows from the outside with no seed and much water. It is a good stage from Aleppo. East of al-Bab previously mentioned, between Aleppo and the Euphrates, is the city of Manbij. Al-Rashid asked Abd al-Malik bin Salih about its night; he was told it is all a dawn (pleasant). Abu Firas al-Hamdani has poetry on its parks and places of pleasure. It has flowing water, and most of its trees are mulberry for raising silkworms. It is where longitude is sixty-three degrees forty-five minutes and latitude thirty-five degrees thirty minutes. Between it and the Euphrates at Qal'at Najm and the bridge is twenty-five miles. This fortress is in the clouds, described by al-Fadil with wonderful description. That place used to be called Manbij, then became known as Qal'at Najm. It is built by Sultan Mahmud bin Zanki, may God have mercy on him. He often garrisoned there and raided the Franks who dominated the frontiers of the Levant and Jazira during the strife. We crossed this bridge to Harran. Above it by a good stage is the fortress of Bidayah crossed to Saruj, upon whose mention al-Hariri built his Maqamat. It has many waters and orchards, containing preferred pomegranates, pears, peaches, and quinces. Between it and Harran is a stage, sometimes done in two. The first thing you meet in this Fourth Part of the Euphrates descending from the bridge of Manbij to the East and South is the city of Balis, famous for wealthy merchants. The desert is between it and Aleppo, and often Arabs intercept its people. It is on the western Levantine side. East and south of it on the eastern Jazira side is the city of Raqqa, known as al-Bayda (The White) for the whiteness of its sand and wall. It is the capital of the abodes of the land of Jazira (Mesopotamia), where longitude is sixty-six degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude thirty-six degrees. Located is the island of Qarqisiya (Circesium), between the Euphrates and the Khabur descending from Ras al-Ayn, where longitude is sixty-six degrees fifty minutes and latitude thirty-five degrees twenty minutes. Below it is the city of al-Rahbah, having many fruits on the west of the Euphrates on the Levantine side. It is the port of Palmyra (Tadmur), a stage away in the desert. It has great large monuments. Arab poets claim the Jinn built it for Solomon son of David, peace be upon them. It has a mosque of a single rock like a cavity in a cut mountain; the roof of that mosque and everything in it is made from it. It is a land of olives and palms, containing much Saltwort (Ghasul). Located is the Island of 'Ana in the middle of the Euphrates, where longitude is sixty-seven degrees twenty minutes. It is from the land of Jazira. Christianity dominates its people. Its heat is mentioned in poems. Below it in the middle of the Euphrates is al-Hadithah where longitude is sixty-seven degrees and minutes. Located is the city of Hit on the west of the Euphrates; it is also a city of Jazira and the limit ends there, where longitude is sixty-eight degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-four degrees. It is a town of bounties and palms. Located is the city of al-Anbar on the eastern side of the Euphrates. It is the first city of Iraq from the direction of Jazira, where longitude is sixty-nine degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude thirty-two degrees twenty minutes. Located is the famous city of Kufa on an arm of the Euphrates in its west, where longitude is sixty-nine degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees fifty minutes.",

    "text": "It is Islamic, built in the time of Umar bin al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him. It is said the water of the Flood overflowed from a place near it. It is a town of palms and contains Iraqi violets. The city of Wasit lies on the bank of the Tigris where longitude is sixty-two degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-two degrees twenty minutes. In this part lie the marshes (Bata'ih) of Kufa from the overflow of Euphrates waters, where Bedouins and highwaymen take refuge. Located in this Fourth Part among the cities of Jazira is ancient Harran, where longitude is sixty-five degrees and latitude thirty-six degrees. It is on the main road to Mosul from Aleppo. Located is Ras al-Ayn where longitude is sixty-six degrees fifty-five minutes and latitude thirty-six degrees thirty minutes. Below it are many waters and orchards; from its springs, the Khabur gathers. Outside it is a lake of extreme depth; dinars are thrown into it to measure how they descend to its bottom, and divers descend after them to pick them up. It has abundant water lilies of various delightful colors. Located at the end of the latitude of the Fourth Clime is the city of Nusaybin, capital of Diyar Rabi'a, where longitude is sixty-seven degrees fifty minutes. It is distinguished by white roses whose rosewater pervades the world and is preferred over all other types. No red roses are found in it or within the borders. It is shielded in the North by the Large Mountain, from which descends the River Hirmas passing its wall, with many orchards on it, then pouring into the River Sayhan (likely Khabur tributary). Between Ras al-Ayn on the mountain is Mardin; its fortress cannot be aspired to. The Hamdanids used to call it the Ash-grey Falcon (al-Baz al-Ashhab). It has much goat hair (Mar'az) from which cloaks are carried to lands. Between it and Nusaybin is the Abode of the King of Persia (Dara?); it is now a village on a river on whose banks are many pomegranates and other things. South of Nusaybin is the city of Sinjar, one of the best cities. Its mountain is one of the most fertile, containing walnuts and almonds broken by the palm of the hand. From it, many pomegranate seeds, dried figs, and [...] made from grapes are brought. Inside it is a flowing spring exiting to the exterior, added to what becomes a river from it. The river of Nusaybin is added to it, and all pour into the famous Tharthar on which was the city of al-Hadr, now a ruin. In the forests of this river are many lions. It pours into the deserts. The location of Sinjar is where longitude is sixty-eight degrees twenty minutes and latitude thirty-five degrees forty minutes. The city of Mosul, capital of the land of Jazira, lies west of the Tigris where longitude is sixty-nine degrees and latitude thirty-five degrees thirty minutes. In front of it on the eastern side is Nineveh, city of Jonah peace be upon him, on a hill back; it is a ruin. There is the Hill of Repentance (Tell al-Tawbah). This city is one of the best lands in view regarding its waters, orchards, and streets on the Tigris. Its people have distinctiveness. It has many industries, especially inlaid copper vessels carried from it to kings, as well as silk clothes woven there. South and east of it on the eastern side is the mouth of the Lesser Zab near the ruined city of Ashur (Assur), mentioned in the Torah; the Assyrian kings who destroyed Jerusalem were there. After it, the Greater Zab pours from the eastern side; on it are orchards from which pomegranates are brought via Tigris to Baghdad. Tikrit, the last city of Jazira adjacent to Iraq, lies west of the Tigris where longitude is seventy-two and a half degrees. Between it and Mosul for caravans is six days, in a land where naphtha is made as if it were a piece of Hell. Near Mosul is a depression with hot water having a royal structure where people benefit. South and east of it is the Ishaqi River, dug in the days of al-Mutawakkil by Ishaq bin Ibrahim, chief of his police. It is the beginning of the Sawad (fertile lands) of Iraq; from there trees begin, and Tigris waters exit in which the land of Iraq swims. At it ends the Fourth Part. The city of Erbil (Irbil), capital of the land of Shahrazur, is located where longitude is sixty-nine degrees fifty minutes and latitude thirty-six degrees twenty minutes.",

    "text": "Part Five: The first thing you meet on the bank of the Tigris are the cities of Iraq. They are fourteen. Al-Zawra' (The Oblique) is one of them; it is the city of Al-Mansur on the western side of the Sarat River and Isa River descending from the Euphrates to the Tigris. The city where the Caliphate was in our time is on the eastern side. The length of its bowstring on the Tigris is two miles, and it has two bridges. Most buildings of Baghdad are of reed, baked brick, lime, and gypsum; its air spoils them, so hardly a glance falls upon them in all its buildings (they decay fast). Marble cracks from the heat. The cheapest thing there is dates, brought from Basra, and rice and sugar cane brought from the Marshes. The regions of Wasit contain Wasiti apples, Raziqi grapes, village bitter oranges, Yaqubi lemons, Baghdadi paper, and Wasiti pens. Ships ascend to it with goods of India on the Tigris. Its location is where longitude is seventy-three degrees and latitude thirty-three degrees nine minutes. The Isa River descends from the Euphrates and pours into the Tigris between the Village and al-Rishlah (?). It is one of the large rivers exiting the Euphrates, irrigating estates numbering the days of the months. Similar to it are the River of the King (Nahr al-Malik) and the River of the Nile. From the Tigris exit these waters in the land of Iraq: al-Qatul on the eastern side of Surra Man Ra'a (Samarra), and al-Nahrawan descends from Shahrazur to Baghdad. If a traveler goes from it to Ctesiphon (al-Mada'in), he crosses this river on a large bridge, and its mouth is in the Tigris. Al-Mada'in, which belonged to the Chosroes, is a stage from Baghdad. The Iwan (Arch) remains on the eastern side, made of brick and bitumen. People of Iraq often use bitumen in their buildings, especially in baths and water places. From al-Mada'in, the Tigris twists and goes west until Wasit is located in the Fourth Part, as mentioned. Then lie the Marshes of Wasit and Basra from rivers exiting the Tigris below Wasit in this part. They are eighty farsakhs by the same. They appeared during the days the Persians were busy fighting the Arabs in early Islam, becoming a secluded province, perhaps having a rebel king. Its capital is al-Jamid. The largest river pouring into it is the Euphrates. Most of its people are Chaldeans, on the religion of Seth peace be upon him; they call them Sabians. From the Chaldeans was Abu Ishaq al-Sabi the scribe; he has a work on that. The city of Basra, built in the Caliphate of Umar, lies where longitude is seventy-four degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees. It is on a river called al-Fayd (?) with its east and the Island of al-Ubulla—one of the world's parks—between this river, the Ma'qil River, the Ubulla River, and the Tigris. If the tide rises from the Persian Sea, it does not drink from these waters. They mention it ascends six days. Basra occupies a length of seven days from the source to the source (ayn to ayn), meaning from 'Abbas to Abadan. Abadan lies on the Persian River, which surrounds it leaving little between it and the mainland, where longitude is seventy-five degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees five minutes. The Tigris pours into the Persian Sea. South and east of Abadan are al-Khashabat (The Wooden Stakes); they are markers in the sea ships reach, warning of reefs that usually occur from the Tigris mouth. At night, lights are raised on these markers for ships. East of al-Khashabat is the mouth of the Tigris of Ahvaz, where longitude is seventy-seven degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees minus ten minutes. East of that is Mahruban, a port of Fars, where longitude is seventy-seven degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty degrees forty minutes. East of it is Jannabah, a port of Fars, to which Abu Sa'id al-Jannabi the Qarmatian, owner of heinous deeds, is attributed. Its location is where longitude is seventy-eight degrees twenty minutes. East of it is the most famous port of Fars, Siraf, where longitude is seventy-nine degrees and latitude thirty degrees thirty minutes. Its people are the most knowledgeable of sea leadership, and its buildings are of teak wood. Located in this part among the cities of Fars is its ancient capital, Istakhr (Persepolis), where longitude is seventy-nine degrees and a minute and latitude thirty-two degrees. In it were the treasuries of the Chosroes and the Diwan of Fars. That moved in Islam to Shiraz, built in the time of al-Hajjaj. It is where longitude is seventy-nine degrees and latitude thirty-two degrees thirty-one minutes. Its ruler now has a magnificent army and a house for pearls, some coming from its fishery, so the lands remain between fear and desire in security and health. Jur (Firuzabad), one of the capitals of the districts of Fars, lies where longitude is ninety-eight degrees [sic, likely 78] and latitude thirty-one degrees thirty minutes. To it is attributed the Juri rose...",

    "text": "...which is high quality like the Nusaybi. The city of Ahvaz, the ancient capital of Khuzestan, lies where longitude is seventy-five degrees and latitude thirty-two degrees; it is described with intense fever. From it to Askar Mukram is ten farsakhs. It is a famous city of Khuzestan surrounded by the Tigris of Ahvaz and the Masruqan River. It has Askar sugar and dragging scorpions whose victim does not survive. Thus it was said: As soon as its sugar rises, its scorpions sting. From it to the North and East is the city of Shushtar, capital of Khuzestan in our time. It was called Shtar. To it are attributed Shtari silk clothes. Between it and Askar Mukram is a stage. From it descend the waters of Isfahan gathering to the Tigris of Ahvaz. Between it and Isfahan is Mount al-Lawz (Almond Mountain), its length about six days, containing a multitude of Kurds and a king called Hrarast (?). Isfahan, one of the capitals of Persian Iraq known in books as al-Jibal, lies where longitude is seventy-five degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-four minutes. It consists of twelve quarters, each like a city; the described ones are Shahristan and al-Yahudiyyah. Zandrud, a beautiful river, passes these quarters. This city has healthy air such that three apples were presented to its governor, each from a year, and he could not distinguish the old from the new. It is said its grass is saffron, its soil is kohl, and its flies are bees. Isfahani honey is the ultimate, as are its roses. Nahavand, a famous city of al-Jibal, lies where longitude is seventy-three degrees thirty-one minutes and latitude thirty-six degrees. Hamadan, capital of Persian Iraq, lies where longitude is thirty-four degrees [sic, likely 74] and latitude thirty-six degrees thirty-one minutes; it is the end of the latitude of the Fourth Clime. Nuditund (?) lies where longitude is seventy-five degrees thirty-one minutes; it is in Mount Damavand veiled by clouds; there is no mountain in Persian Iraq higher than it. The fortress city of Gerdkuh, famous among Ismaili strongholds, lies where longitude is fifty-nine degrees [sic, likely 79] and latitude thirty-six degrees. It is the Quhistan mountain between Khurasan, Fars, and Kerman. In this part is the capital of Kerman in our time, Kawashir (Bardasir?), where longitude is eighty-four degrees and latitude thirty degrees twenty minutes. Among ancient capitals of Kerman is al-Shirjan, where longitude is eighty-four degrees and latitude thirty-two degrees. Likewise the city of Jiroft, where longitude is eighty-five and a half degrees and latitude thirty-two degrees ten minutes. In its mountains is Kerman iron from which Kerman swords are made. Located in this part among the capitals of Khurasan is the city of Herat, where longitude is eighty-seven degrees thirty minutes and latitude thirty-five and a half degrees. West of it is the capital of Quhistan where longitude is eighty-four degrees and latitude thirty-five degrees ten minutes. East of it with the South are the mountains of Ghur; their capital is the city of Firuzkuh, where longitude is eighty-nine degrees forty minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees.

    "text": "Part Six: The first thing you meet in it is the city of Bamiyan. It is a capital for its regions, surrounded by mountains and waters. From its mountain descend some rivers of Jayhun (Oxus). The location of Bamiyan is where longitude is seventy degrees five minutes and latitude thirty-four degrees. The most famous, largest, and longest flowing of Jayhun's rivers is River [...], descending from the mountains of Khatan (?), where longitude is ninety-seven degrees and latitude thirty degrees three minutes. Many springs descend to it from that mountain and from the mountains of Kabulistan of the Third Clime. When it passes the mountain of Bamiyan, rivers with obscure names descend to it, then they all gather near the end of the latitude of the Fourth Clime. Its main column, Jayhun, descends to the Fifth. East of Mount Ghur and Bamiyan, and west of Kabulistan, lie the lands of Sijistan (Seistan). Its ancient capital is Zaranj, where longitude is seventy-four degrees seven minutes and latitude thirty-two degrees six minutes. The Indian River Sindh, exiting from the east of the Ghur mountains, traverses the lands of Sijistan from west to east. The city of Bust lies on it to its north, where longitude is ninety-three degrees and latitude thirty degrees. Then the river passes until it ends where longitude is ninety-five degrees to the South. Zaranj is to its north by about twenty miles; a stream reaches it from the river splitting it, utilized by its people for the Mosque and other things. Then the river twists West. At the place of its twisting, on a cut-off mountain of extreme impregnability, is the stronghold of al-Taq, which cannot be aspired to. The kings of these lands take refuge in it and place their treasuries there. Its longitude aligns with Zaranj, and latitude is thirty-one degrees. The river passes north of it westward until it pours into Lake Sijistan. The length of this lake from West to East is three days, and width is half that. South of Sijistan are the domains of the Khalaj, who are Turks. They have gallantry (and tested well) in the conquests of India, conquering what bordered them and owning the city of Uch and the city of Nahawar on the River Mehran. North of Sijistan is the land of Tukharistan; its capital is Tirmidh in the Fifth Clime on the River Jayhun. East of it is the land of Khatan with obscure names. At its edges are rivers and meadows inhabited by Turkish races; they fight over them with the Indians, for they neighbor them from the South. Part Seven: The first thing you meet in it is the Indian land of Qandabar; its capital was previously mentioned at the end of the Third Clime's line. Muslims had conquered it and made it a frontier for what is east of it. Then they conquered in its east the land of Uch on the east of Mehran descending to the land of Sindh, where longitude is one hundred and twenty degrees fifty-five minutes and latitude thirty-three degrees. East of it is the land of Nahawar, also conquered by Muslims from the Turks. Its capital is the city of Nahawar, also on the east of Mehran, where longitude is one hundred and sixty-five degrees and latitude thirty-four degrees twelve minutes.",

Its location is where longitude is one hundred and twenty-eight degrees fifty minutes and latitude thirty-five degrees fifty minutes. It has three ponds of rainwater: one for the Sultan, one for the soldiers, and one for the commoners. The ruler of Delhi in our time is one of the Mamluks of the Ghurids. His army consists of Muslim Turks, and the subjects are disbelieving Indians. The Tatars could not overcome his land due to the brave men (Lions of Men) and many elephants he has. Located in this part among the capitals of Hindustan, each having a king, is Hasi (Hansi): It is at the beginning of the part, where longitude is one hundred and twenty-six degrees eight minutes and latitude thirty-one degrees. East of it by a stage is the city of Barawar. It is where longitude is one hundred and twenty-nine degrees and latitude thirty-one degrees thirty-five minutes. East of it and east of Delhi are the mountains of Kashmir, inhabited by a race generated between India and Sindh. The Turks are of utmost beauty. The Tatars could not overcome them due to their impregnability in the mountains surrounding them in this Fifth Clime. The River Ganges, venerated by Indians, passes through their lands. They also venerate it and drown themselves in it because they share the error with them. East of them is Tamghaj, the land of Khita (Cathay). Travelers claim the wall surrounds its cities, estates, and all settlements for about twenty-three days in length from West to East. Its western border is the land of Kashmir, and its eastern border is the land of the Tatars. Its length and width take up this part and the next part of the Fifth Clime. Famous among its cities is the city of Tamghaj. The city of Khanbaliq (Beijing) has taken its place in this era of ours. They mention regarding the size of this city what only an eyewitness would believe. Its ruler is a Muslim called Lwaja (?), originally from Khwarizm; he carries monies to the Tatars. The subjects are disbelievers from the races of Khita, most of whom have entered Islam. Silk is abundant in their lands. It is said they have many silver mines. South of their lands is the land of Ballhara, King of Kings of India. The city of Khanbaliq is located where longitude is one hundred and forty degrees and latitude thirty-five degrees twenty-five minutes. The city of Tamghaj is in the Fifth Clime. Part Nine: The first thing you meet in it is the city of Kharaq (Karakorum?), one of the ancient capitals of the Tatars. It is where longitude is forty-six degrees [sic, likely 146] and latitude thirty-five degrees forty-five minutes. East of it is the city of Yanbu'a (?), which was the capital of the Tatars in ancient times. It is on a river descending from the Great Mountain extending over the lands of India and China. It is where longitude is one hundred and fifty-two degrees and latitude thirty degrees five minutes. East of it is a river descending from the River of the Port to the River of Yajooj (Gog). East of that is the capital of the Tatars in our time, Karakorum. It is where longitude is one hundred and fifty degrees forty minutes and latitude thirty degrees thirty-six minutes. In its regions are the lands of the Mughals, the elite of the Tatars; their Khans are from there. They have in this part and the next Lake Kawarith. South of it is Mount Kawarith from which the river of the Lake [...] descends and the river of the lake which will be mentioned. Part Ten: Contains the rest of the land of the Mughals and the rest of the lake of the land of Kawarith. East of it is Lake Sukam; its length is four stages and width two stages. No river descends to it; rather, springs are inside it, and rainwater seeps to it from the directions. East of it is the land of Turghay (?), a bird that hunts two birds in one rise; it strikes the first leaving it to fall then hunts the second. It is also called the land of Sunqur (Falcon). South of them and east of the Mughal land is the land of Samighli. They are brothers of the Mughals, but leadership belongs to the Mughals. They have the city of Samighli on a lake where longitude is one hundred and seventy-seven degrees twenty-two minutes and latitude thirty-two degrees minus minutes. They have a mountain winding on the east of their lands from Sin-Sin and entering the Surrounding Ocean. Two rivers descend to them from it into two lakes, the overflow of which descends to the sea at the end of the inhabited world. North of them is the River Manjar the Great, descending from the Great Mountain of China forming a medium lake at its end, then a river exits it forming a small lake, then its overflow pours into the Surrounding Ocean. North of this river are the Mountains of Qarqar, circling the lands of these people. Travelers claim their eyes are in their chests. They have the city of Qarqar at the end of habitation. South of it is a lake from which a river exits to a second lake. Fifth Clime",

The latitude at its end from the Equator is forty-one degrees thirty-one minutes, and its width is five degrees. Part One: The first thing you meet in it in the sea are three of the Islands of Happiness, as drawn. And the Island of Cadiz (Qadis); it is small, part in the Fourth Clime and part in the Fifth. Between it and the mainland is a strait of small width. Longitude is eight degrees twenty-one minutes. From that place, the Surrounding Ocean begins to decline to the West with North. The mouth of the River of Seville (Guadalquivir) and Cordoba is where longitude is eight degrees fifteen minutes and latitude thirty-six degrees forty-five minutes. Then to the Island of Saltes (Shaltish) thirty-six degrees [sic - distance/degrees confusion], where longitude is seven degrees twenty minutes and latitude thirty-seven degrees twelve minutes. Then to the mouth of the Great River Guadiana (Yana), passing Merida and Badajoz, nine miles. Then to the city of Tavira (Tawirah) twenty-three miles. It is on the River Guadiana and north of it. Then to the mouth of the River Santa Maria eighteen miles. Then to the mouth of the River Silves (Shalb) twenty-eight miles. Then to Hawz al-Rayhan fifteen miles. Then to Cape St. Vincent (Tarf al-'Urf) eighty miles. It enters the sea from this Cape twenty-two miles; it is the end of the latitude of the Fifth Clime. The longitude there is six degrees. The longitude of the city of Seville, east and south of the river, is nine degrees ten minutes, and latitude thirty-seven degrees thirty minutes. Longitude of the city of Badajoz on the south of Guadiana is nine degrees, and latitude thirty-eight degrees fifty minutes. Longitude of the city of Merida south of the mentioned river is ten degrees minus minutes, and latitude thirty-nine degrees. Longitude of Cordoba, capital of Andalusia in the time of the Umayyads, is ten degrees, and its latitude thirty-eight and a half degrees. It is west of the Great River on which Seville lies. This river only beautifies its sides at Seville. The tide ascends in it from the Surrounding Ocean seventy-two miles. Frankish ships ascend with their cargo to Seville. Longitude of the city of Granada is eleven degrees forty minutes, and latitude thirty-seven degrees thirty minutes. South of it is Mount Sierra Nevada (Shulayr), which snow never leaves. Ibn al-Yashi' recounted that over twenty rivers descend from it, including the River Darro (Hadarro/River of Gold) which splits Granada, and River Genil (Masil?) which passes its wall; both have mills and orchards. This city in our time is the capital of Ibn al-Ahmar, king of those remaining Muslims in Andalusia. Longitude of the city of Jaen is like the longitude of Granada, and latitude thirty-nine degrees minus minutes. Longitude of the city of Murcia is eighteen degrees. Latitude is thirty-nine degrees and minutes. It is north of a beautiful river having waterwheels and orchards. It is the end of the River of Seville whose source is from Mount Segura (Shaqurah), where longitude is fifteen degrees and latitude thirty-eight degrees forty minutes. It exits from a single spring, flows east past Murcia and pours into the Sea of the Romans, while the River of Seville flows west and pours into the Surrounding Ocean.",

Located is the city of Naples famous on that coast, where longitude is thirty-four degrees thirty minutes. Near it is Salerno from which large hazelnuts are brought. West of Naples is the city of Rome, capital of the Pope. It is on both sides of the River Tiber. Its sides were reinforced because it collapses. Ships enter it from the sea to between the shops, so people buy what they need. It comes from a mountain in its north. It is very large. In its center is a fortified castle on a cut-off hill. The location of this city is where longitude is thirty-three degrees and latitude with the end of the Fifth Clime forty-one degrees thirty-one minutes. So said Ibn Fatimah, and he is the verifier. Al-Khwarizmi said: Longitude thirty-five degrees thirty minutes and latitude forty-three degrees fifty minutes, so it enters the Sixth Clime. West of it is Pisa, famous among ports of the Franks frequenting Islamic lands. It is where longitude is thirty-three and a half degrees and latitude forty-one degrees.

From there, the sea goes to the famous Island of Crete (Iqritish), which the Muslims, the people of the Rabad of Cordoba, conquered in the time of Al-Ma'mun and ruled for a period. Then the Kharayita (Greeks/Byzantines?) regained it, so it is now in their hands. Its length is three hundred and fifty miles from West to East. Its city is where longitude is forty-seven degrees seven minutes and latitude [offset by] one and a half degrees. Cheese and honey are brought from it to Alexandria. East of it is the Island of Rhodes. Muawiyah had conquered it and placed a garrison there to raid the Gulf of Constantinople. Then Yazid withheld their pay, so they fled to the Levant and evacuated it, and the Romans possessed it. It is now among the islands of the Kharayita. The length of this island slanted from North to South is about fifty miles, and the width half that. Between it and the mainland of the Kharayita from the direction of its city is about fifteen miles. Between it and the tail of Crete is a course; Crete is West by South. Between Rhodes and Antioch is three courses. East of it is the Island of Cyprus, conquered by Muslims in the time of Muawiyah.

And the city of Ras al-Ayn is with the beginning of the Fifth Clime, longitude sixty-six degrees. From its waters descends the River Khabur. East of the Tigris is Mount Judi mentioned in the Quran; snow never leaves it. It appears from afar due to its height. On it is the village of Thamanin (Eighty), being the number saved with Noah peace be upon him in the Ark. East of that from the land of Azerbaijan is Khoy, where longitude is seventy degrees and latitude forty degrees. Aligned with it in latitude is Salmas. Salmas is a degree longer.

The city of Narbonne (Narbuna) lies where longitude is twenty-seven degrees and latitude forty-three degrees twenty minutes. South of it is a lake connecting to the Sea of the Strait. Musa bin Nusayr reached it in the conquest of Andalusia and placed the idol in its east, on which was: O Sons of Ishmael, return. It was said that happened by a trick of the soldiers so he would return, so he returned. Narbonne remained the furthest frontier of Muslims in east Andalusia until the Franks regained it during the Strife. East of it by miles from a bay is the city of Montpellier (Munbulir), famous for wealthy merchants. Its location is where longitude is twenty-eight degrees and latitude forty-three degrees fifty minutes. Towards the South is the city of Marseille (Marsiliyah), one of the ports of the Franks frequenting the lands of Islam.",

It consists of cities and settlements penetrated by rivers where ships sail with sails. Its capital is the city of Milan (Malan), where longitude is thirty degrees thirty-seven minutes and latitude forty-three degrees. East of it is the city of Venice (al-Bunduqiyah) at the end of the Gulf of the Venetians, where longitude is thirty-two degrees and latitude forty-four degrees four minutes. It is on an island; its buildings are of wood, and boats travel in it from house to house. A person's ship anchors at his house. They have no place to walk except the courtyard containing the exchange market, made for their rest if they need to walk. Their king from among themselves is called the Doge (al-Duj). In a river of his land is gold inclining to green. He has many great timbers. On the shore of the Venetian Sea is Mount Askhufuniyah (Slavonia/Dalmatia coast?), containing timbers, falcons, and brave men with whom the people of Genoa are defeated at sea. They have many small islands in this part and the next. On the shore of its sea are many settlements for the worshippers of the Cross. South of this sea is the city of Rome, capital of the Pope; according to Al-Khwarizmi's view, mentioned in the Fifth Clime. Located in this part is the city of Lucera (Lushirah), where the Emperor settled the Muslims he expelled from Sicily. It is where longitude is thirty-five degrees twenty-seven minutes and latitude forty-two degrees.",

    "text": "Part Three: The first thing you meet in it, north of the Gulf of the Venetians, is the city of Sibiniqu (Sebenico/Šibenik), belonging to the Hungarians (al-Hunkar), who are Turks following the Christian religion. Its location is where longitude is thirty-seven degrees forty minutes and latitude forty-five degrees. The Tatars reached it, so the Hungarians, Bashqirs, and Germans gathered against them there and defeated them a defeat that made them despair of returning to those lands. West of this city on the Gulf is Mount Askhufuniyah, previously mentioned. At the beginning of the Gulf from the southern side is Brindisi (Barandis). It is on the western side at the mouth of the Gulf. It is narrow there then widens after this city to about a course and a half, remaining so to its end. Brindisi is famous among sailors; it is where longitude is forty degrees eleven minutes and latitude forty-four degrees. On the north of the Gulf where longitude is forty degrees fifteen minutes is the city of Athens (Athina), the city of Aristotle the Wise. The authority of the Ashkari (Laskaris), ruler of Constantinople, reaches it. North and west of it is the city of Barshan (Presian?), which was a capital for a nation that the Germans took over, leaving no mention of them. It is where longitude is forty degrees and latitude forty-five degrees. From this city to Constantinople, from the lands inhabited by the Kharayita—who are the remnants of the Greeks—is a large number; they have obscure names and are undistinguished among Muslims. In this part lies the Island of Lamriya (Morea), known in books as the Island of Peloponnese. It has cities and settlements and is the largest of the Roman islands. Its circumference is precisely seven hundred miles. It has bays, curves, and a mouth to the land miles wide. On it from the west and south is the city of Korit (Coron/Koroni?), where longitude is forty-six degrees twenty minutes and latitude forty degrees. In its center is the city of Lamriya (Lacedaemonia/Sparta?), where the ruler of the island resides. It is where longitude is forty-five degrees fifty-two minutes and latitude forty-three degrees twenty-five minutes. Between this island and the Island of Crete is the strait from which one enters the many Roman islands; its size is sixty miles, and it is necessary for entering them. North of this island is the Island of Negropont (al-Naghrib - Euboea), one of the largest Roman islands. Its length from West to East deviating South is one hundred and fifty miles, and its width from twenty miles to thereabouts. Its eastern end is where longitude is forty-eight degrees fifty minutes and latitude forty-three degrees minus minutes. It is famous for ships and galleys exiting from it. East of it among Roman islands is the Island of Mastic (Chios), from which it is brought to regions; it is tree gum. Its length from North to South is about sixty miles. Between it and Negropont is about thirty miles. North of it is the Gulf of Constantinople. East of it is the city of Abzu (Abydos), by which the Mouth of Abzu is known. It belongs to the Kharayita, who are Christians who do not shave their beards. Its location is where longitude is forty-nine degrees forty-nine minutes. The width of this gulf is a bowshot. Its length likewise from the Sea of the Strait (Mediterranean/Aegean) to the city of Abzu is about fifty miles. Then it starts widening until after thirty miles from it, it approximates sixty miles. It passes like that for about a course. On it are cities of the Kharayita under the obedience of the ruler of Constantinople, built by Constantine the founder of the Christian religion. Its place was meadows in the land of the King of Barshan (Persians?), so he asked him to graze his horses. Then when his news was cut off by rains and mud, he built this city and made it the capital of the Caesars. The King of Barshan could not overcome him, then the Barshan perished. Constantinople is where longitude is forty-nine degrees fifty minutes, and latitude at the end of the Sixth Clime is forty-five degrees. The sea is on its three sides; the land is only from the western side. The narrow gulf passes by force, extending about eighty miles. At its end is the city of Nicomedia, which was the capital of the Greeks. In geography (Ptolemy's), its longitude is fifty-one degrees and latitude forty-four degrees fifteen minutes. South of it among famous lands to the people of those countries is the city of Asmara (Smyrna/Izmir?) on an inlet of the sea, where longitude is fifty degrees forty minutes and latitude forty-three degrees twenty-three minutes. South of it on an inlet of the sea is the city of Elia (Ilium/Troy?), one of the cities of the wise men mentioned in their books. Its location is where longitude is fifty degrees fifty-five minutes. East of these lands are the mountains of the Turkomans and their lands. They are a great multitude from the descendants of the Turks who conquered the lands of Rum (Anatolia) in the time of the Seljuks. They are accustomed to raiding the inhabitants of the coast from the Kharayita, taking their children and selling them to...",

On their coast is a gulf called the Gulf of Makri (Fethiye), famous among travelers; wood is brought from it to Alexandria and elsewhere. The River of al-Battal pours into it. It is deep and has a bridge; if there is a truce it is erected, and if war occurs it is lifted. It is a border between Muslims and Christians. Al-Battal, to whom it is attributed, is the one who frequently raided the Romans in the Umayyad state, whose name is mentioned in books of night tales; his grave is there. North of Antioch mentioned before are the Mountains of Taghurla (Taurus?). It is said in it and its directions are about two hundred thousand Turkoman tents; they are the ones called the Uj (Oghuz/Uch). There is the city of Taghurla. Between it and the fortress of Khiyas, where fine bows are made, is two farsakhs. The mountains of the Turkomans connect from the Gate of Taghurla to the King al-Ashkari, ruler of Constantinople. Between Taghurla and the bridge to its west is thirty miles. East of that is the River Heraclea (Harqalah) descending from the Mountain of Alanya to the end of Sinop. On it is Heraclea near the sea, which Al-Rashid destroyed. East of it is the Mountain of the Cave (Jabal al-Kahf) according to the Romans (Rum). It is said the Cave (of the Seven Sleepers) is there; that is mentioned in the history of Al-Wathiq when he sent someone to investigate the matter from the ruler of Constantinople. East of that are the famous meadows where Al-Mu'tasim was eager to graze his horses from Iraq. There are large springs there. The Romans call that place Qaranbuk. In that direction is the city of Ankuriyah (Ankara). It is said to be Amorium ('Ammuriyah) which Al-Mu'tasim conquered. It now belongs to Muslims.

In its regions is [...] which are mountains containing about thirty thousand Turkoman tents. West of Ankara at eight farsakhs is the city of Sultan Buli. The road between them is farms and springs. In this city are two baths whose water is like the water of thermal springs (Hamma), needing no heating; it flows constantly, intensely hot. From Ankara to the capital of the lands, the city of Konya, is four days. The location of Konya is where longitude is fifty-five degrees and latitude forty-one and a half degrees. It has a river descending from the mountain south of it, irrigating it from its west, forming a lake and meadows. Mountains surround it from every side, distancing from it on the north side. On its gate facing north is an image of the Wise Man who ordered its placement there, pointing to the north, as if saying: The mountains here are far, so no harm comes to you from them. Its buildings are of mud; the houses of chiefs and the wealthy are whitened. In the houses of kings and notables are slabs of white marble. Lemons, grapes, and fruits are abundant in it and other lands of Rum. Large good pistachios are brought from some of its regions. There is the large apricot known as Qamar al-Din; it is almond-like, preferred over the apricot of Damascus. Its Sultan is from the lineage of the Seljuks, Turks who believed and ruled from the lands of Turkestan to the Sea of the Levant, and conquered these lands now known as the lands of Rum. This Sultan is called the Owner of the Dome and the Bird. He is today appeasing the Tatars with money, and his lands are entering into theirs. It is said his sultanate contains twenty-four large cities, having governors, judges, officials, mosques, cloth merchants, and baths. As for the villages (estates), it is said they are four hundred thousand estates, of which thirty-six thousand have been ruined. It has silver mines whose workers never cease, and iron mines. East of Konya is Aqshar (Akşehir). It is longer (in longitude) than Konya by a degree and a half. Konya is wider (in latitude) by a quarter degree. This city is one of the beautiful cities with many inhabitants and waters. Most of what is in it is dyed beautiful apples, large pears, preferred quince, and high-quality peaches. East of it is the city of Aksaray, where beautiful rugs are made. It is at the latitude of Aqshar and longer than it by a degree. It also has many fruits carried on carts to Konya across a plain entirely of farms and valleys. The people of those lands say the distance of this road is forty-eight farsakhs. Likewise from Aksaray to the city of Kayseri (Caesarea). It is attributed to Caesar and called in our time Qaysariyah. It is a majestic city where the Sultan of the lands stays, moving from it to Konya and from Konya to it. It is where longitude is fifty-six and a half degrees and latitude forty-two degrees forty minutes. The road between it and Aksaray is all farms and valleys in a plain where wagons travel with oxen. East of Kayseri is the city of Sivas (Sebastia), one of the mother cities of the lands, famous among merchants. It is in a plain where longitude is fifty-seven and a half degrees and latitude forty-one degrees forty minutes. Travelers cut off on this road say they find in it twenty-four Khans containing everything they need, especially in days of snow. East of it is the city of Erzurum (Arzan al-Rum), the last of the lands of al-Durub from the East. Its location is where longitude is sixty-four degrees and latitude forty-two degrees thirty minutes. East and north of it is the source of the Euphrates from springs, meadows, thickets, and violets where longitude is sixty-four degrees thirty minutes and latitude forty-three and a half degrees. The people of those lands say that Erzurum is among the highest of lands. Some exaggerated saying it is higher than all the earth by forty cubits. In it is a great spring from which two parts exit; one part is the Euphrates, and a part passes east, which is the large river pouring into the Sea of the Gate (Caspian). Around that large spring are many springs, and violet grows between them. Ibn Fatimah mentioned that the Euphrates is supplied by a river extending from a mountain where longitude is sixty-eight and a half degrees and latitude forty-one degrees twenty minutes. From here Ptolemy placed the source of the Euphrates. From the mentioned mountain is the source of the River Aras (Araxes), which splits the lands of Azerbaijan and pours towards the Gate (Derbent/Caspian). That is where longitude is seventy degrees and latitude forty-two degrees twenty-two minutes. The people of Rum say that between Sivas and Erzurum is the famous city of Erzincan; between it and each of them is sixty farsakhs. The road between...",

They said: Travelers carry their goods from Turiz (Tabriz) in wagons pulled by oxen to Konya, covering that long distance which is about forty days. South of the river supplying the Euphrates from the East lies the city of Shirvan, which is the capital of its lands and mountains annexed to the Sultanate of Azerbaijan. Its location is where longitude is sixty-eight degrees fifty-six minutes, and latitude forty-one degrees forty-three minutes. Ibn Fatimah said: In this part lies the Great River Kur (Kura), which splits the land of Arran and pours into the Sea of Tabaristan (Caspian Sea). Its origin is from a spring where longitude is sixty-three degrees, and latitude forty-four degrees forty minutes. On it is the capital of the Georgians (al-Kurj), the city of Tiflis (Tbilisi), situated on its bank where longitude is sixty-seven degrees and latitude forty-four degrees. Muslims had conquered it and inhabited it for a long time, and scholars emerged from it. Then the Georgians regained it; they are Christians known to the people of their religion. Their land is called Abkhazia. Before Abkhazia is a fortress for their king in the long mountain which cannot be aspired to (is impregnable). East of it, on the south of the river, among the cities of Arran mentioned in books, is Shamkur (Shamkir), where longitude is sixty-nine and a half degrees, and latitude forty-four degrees. East of it, among the cities of Arran mentioned in relation to it, is the city of Ganja (Khanzah), where longitude is seventy-one degrees, and latitude forty-three degrees thirty-seven minutes.

    "text": "Part Five: The first thing you meet in it is the city of Barda (Bardha'ah), the capital of the Sultanate of Arran. It is on an island between two rivers exiting from the River Kur. Its location is where longitude is seventy-three degrees minus twenty minutes, and latitude forty-four degrees minus fifteen minutes. It is between the River Aras and the River Kur. Between the two rivers along the length of the island land, there is abundant mulberry. Its people are fond of sycamore figs, which are carried from there to other regions. North of the River Kur is the city of Nakhchivan (Naqjuwan), one of the mentioned cities in eastern Arran; the Tatars destroyed it and killed all its inhabitants. It is where longitude is seventy-three degrees seventeen minutes. East and north of it is the City of the Gate (Madinat al-Bab / Derbent), the capital of the Sultanate of the Gate. It consists of three sections on the Great River Atil (Volga/Terek?) at its mouth in the Sea of Tabaristan. The southern section was for Muslims, the northern section for Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians, and the section in the island was for the Khagan of the Khazars, who was Jewish. Then the Rus destroyed it and removed the Khazar sultanate from it. It was populated thereafter by Muslims, then the Tatars destroyed it. Its location is where longitude is seventy-five degrees and latitude forty-five degrees. East of it in the Sea of Tabaristan is the Island of the Gate (Jazirat al-Bab), which has many meadows where the people of the Gate graze their livestock. East of it is the Island of the Volcano (Jazirat al-Burkan); in it is a mountain where fire never ceases burning night and day, and smoke rises from it like the volcano of Sicily and the volcano of India. It is said that the flying naphtha possessed by kings is found in this island. North of it is the Island of Shiyaku (Sia-Kuh?), which Ala al-Din Khwarizm Shah entered when fleeing before the Tatars; he died in the ship before reaching it. East of the Sea of Tabaristan is Mount Shiyaku, occupying the width of the Sixth Clime and the width of the Seventh Clime, then circling with the sea to the north of the City of the Gate; there is no good or harm in it. East of it are the domains of the 'Arabah (Arb?) from the Turkish races up to the sides of the Lake of Khwarizm (Aral Sea). The River Jayhun (Oxus) pours into this lake in this part, and the River Sayhun (Jaxartes) pours into it in the Seventh Clime. After this, its water is not good, and merchants do not penetrate it. It is said its circumference is six hundred miles. Ibn Fatimah said—and it is the verified view—that its eastern edge is with the end of the Seventh Part. Part Six: The first thing you meet in it is the city of Khwarizm (Urgench); this is how the common Persians know it, and it is its name in the Jurjanian books. It is on both sides of the Jayhun where longitude is ninety-one degrees fifty minutes, and latitude forty-two degrees ten minutes. It has obscure cities and settlements between the Jayhun and Sayhun. The River Sayhun occupies this part and passes through it. East of it is the River Shash, descending from a mountain at the beginning of the latitude of the Seventh Clime, occupying the width of this part and passing from its direction in the Fifth Clime until it pours into the River Sayhun. On it are the many settlements of Shash (Tashkent), possessing orchards and waters; they are obscure and unrenowned. There is no famous city in all that is east of it; most of those lands are domains for the Turkomans. At the end of the part from the northern corner, the River Sayhun twists to the South and to the West. Part Seven: It is entirely devoid of a famous city. At the end of its latitude passes the Sayhun, and on it are domains of the Turkomans; east of it is the land of Tibet. Part Eight: The first thing you meet in it are the mountains of Sahrujiya. They are a people born between the Kashmiris and the Turks. The city of Sahruj is their capital, surrounded by a sweet lake fed by springs gushing inside it. The location of the city is where longitude is thirty-four degrees [sic, likely 134] and latitude forty-five degrees. East of this lake is Lake Kharman; factions of Turks settle around it, and its center is where longitude is one hundred and forty degrees. Extending from its east is Mount Farghan, which is high and long from West to East, famous among the Turks. Part Nine: The mentioned mountain extends in it to longitude one hundred and forty-nine degrees, then extends in a circle around Lake al-Bali'ah (The Swallowing Lake), which swallows everything that falls into it. East of it is the Red Mountain, also called the Mountain of Rats (Jabal al-Jurz), because rats emerge from its holes whose skins are competed for in clothing by the kings of those regions. East of that is the city of Baghburia, one of the cities of the Adhkash, a Turkish race. It is large, and its location is where longitude is one hundred and fifty-eight degrees and latitude forty-two degrees fifty-three minutes. A river passes east of it. East and south of it is Adhkashiya, the capital of the Adhkash who are near the Dam of Gog and Magog. Its location is where longitude is one hundred and sixty degrees and latitude forty-one degrees thirty-eight minutes.",

The Gate was previously mentioned in the Fifth Clime. East of it are their lands, mostly on the Great River of Gog. Near its mouth in the Surrounding Ocean to its south is the city of Gog (Yajooj), where longitude is one hundred and forty-one minutes [sic, likely degrees], according to Ptolemy's geography. East and south of it is the city of Magog (Majooj), north of their river, where longitude is one hundred and seventy-one degrees, and latitude forty-two degrees. East of the two cities is the Surrounding Ocean, in which there is no habitation. Seventh Clime: The latitude at its end is forty-eight degrees, and its width is three degrees. Part One: The first thing you meet in it on the Surrounding Ocean is the mouth of the Great River Zamora (Douro? or a confusion with Somme/Garonne?), where longitude from the direction of the Eternal Islands (Canary Islands) is five and a half degrees, and latitude forty-six degrees. The city of Zamora (Samurah), capital of Galicia (Ghalisiya) and the largest city of the Alfons (Castilians/Leonese), lies on an island between two branches of this river, where longitude is ten degrees and latitude forty-six degrees. It is mentioned in the raids of Al-Nasir the Marwanid and Al-Mansur bin Abi Amir. Muslims had possessed it, then the Christians regained it during the strife. North of it, with a deviation to the East, is the impregnable city of Leon (Liyun), whose great wall was destroyed by Al-Mansur bin Abi Amir. It is on a river pouring into the Zamora, where longitude is ten degrees thirty minutes, and latitude forty-six degrees fifty-five minutes. In the North and West is Santiago (Shant Yaqu), containing James the Disciple; it has great significance to the Christians. It is on the Surrounding Ocean, surrounded by rivers descending from Mount Fakhira to its east. It is where longitude is nine degrees, and latitude forty-nine degrees. North of it is the city of [...], the last northern corner of Andalusia. From it, the sea turns to the East. It is on the last line of the Seventh Clime, where longitude is ten degrees ten minutes, and latitude forty-eight degrees. Located in this part on the Sea of Britain (Bay of Biscay?), entering the East from the Surrounding Ocean, is the city of Santarem (Shantarin - misplaced here, likely Santander or Saint-Jean-de-Luz?). It is one of the famous villages of Galicia from which Carracks (ships) exit, where longitude is thirteen degrees, and latitude forty-seven degrees fifty-four minutes. East of it is Larmad (?), one of the ports of Gascony (Qansala?) from which Carrack ships exit, where longitude is sixteen degrees thirty-three minutes, and latitude is close to the end of the Seventh Clime. East of it, among the ports of Gascony, is Ardalis (?), where longitude is seventeen degrees twenty-one minutes, and latitude forty-seven degrees twenty-eight minutes. East of it by a stage is the end of the Gulf of Britain. Remaining between it and the Surrounding Ocean is the amount of a stage.",

San Sebastian?), which has many Carracks in an inlet on the Surrounding Ocean, where longitude is nineteen degrees and latitude forty-seven degrees minus eight minutes. East of it is a coast, then the Surrounding Ocean enters the Sixth Clime. The Seventh Clime returns, so on its coast is the land of Poitou (Bitu), and its inhabitants are the free Franks. From it, kings are chosen for France if they are lacking in France; this is a continuous custom. North of Poitou is the mouth of the River Seine (Sin) where longitude is twenty-six degrees thirty minutes. In the middle of this river and its side is the city of Paris (Baris), capital of France. It consists of three pieces as mentioned in the explanation of the City of the Gate. The middle in the island belongs to Francis (The King of France), the Sultan of the Franks. The southern is for the soldiers, and the northern for the rest of their merchants and subjects. This river descends from the Great Mount Danbus (Alps?), called in the North Mount Maliha. From its east is the source of the River Danbus (Danube), said to be larger than the Nile and the Jayhun. It is famous as the River Danuba, and the Turks call it Tana (Don - confusion in text). On its two sides in an island up to its mouth in the Sea of Constantinople are many cities and settlements, but they have obscure names and are unrenowned among us. South and north of this river is the Long Land of Germany (Almaniya), said to have forty kings. Its Sultan is known as the Imperator, meaning King of Kings; the commoners say al-Anbarur. Its ancient capital mentioned in books is Pisa (Bisah - possibly Regensburg/Ratisbon or similar?), where longitude is thirty-two degrees and latitude forty-six degrees twenty-seven minutes. North of it is the Great Mount Kharwasiya (Carpathians/Croatia?), connecting to the mountains of Lombardy and mountains of Askhufuniyah. On it are many districts and fortresses, and from it descend many rivers whose names are obscure to us. North of this mountain is the city of Siqlu (?), where famous German swords are made; it has an iron mine from which they are brought. It is said that in a place in it, there is a mine of poisonous iron from which swords and daggers are made; kings do not allow its discovery to others. This city is where longitude is thirty-three degrees fifty-four minutes, and latitude forty-six degrees fifty-two minutes. East of it and at its latitude is the city of Baqsin (?), distinguished for its scholars and wise men. It is where longitude is forty-four and a half degrees. Part Three: The first thing you meet in it is the land of the Bashqird (Bashkirs/Hungarians). They are Turks who neighbored the Germans by inherited pact. They are Muslims through a Turkoman jurist who enlightened them with the laws of Islam. Most of their settlements are on the Great River Danuba. On its south is their capital, where longitude is thirty-nine degrees twenty-eight minutes, and latitude forty-six degrees forty-eight minutes. It is among what the Tatars entered, destroyed, and whose people they annihilated. East of it is the land of the Hunkar (Hungarians), who are Turks, brothers of the Bashqird, who became Christians by neighboring the Germans. They have cities and settlements on the Great River with foreign names. Their capital is the city of Tarnbu (Tarnovo? Tyrnau?), where longitude is forty-two degrees and latitude forty-six degrees. This is also among what the Tatars entered. East of them are many cities and settlements belonging to the Kingdom of the Ashkari (Laskaris), ruler of Constantinople, with obscure names up to the border of their sea. On the sea to the end of the Third Part is the coast of al-Durub (Byzantine Frontier), belonging to the Christians. The most famous place there is Zaghan, a fortress on the sea and on the mouth of the River Battal; the Romans call it now River Zaghan. That is where longitude is fifty-three degrees, and latitude forty-five degrees forty-one minutes.",

    "text": "Part Four: The first thing you meet in it is the ancient city of Heraclea (Harqalah), which Al-Rashid destroyed. It is where longitude is fifty-four degrees three minutes, and latitude forty-six degrees thirty-five minutes. East of the river descending from the Mountain of Alanya (Alaya) is the River of Poplars (Nahr al-Hawr), named for the trees upon it. East of it, among the famous ports of Rum (Anatolia), is the city of Kastamonu (Kastimuniyah). It belongs to the Muslims, where longitude is fifty-five and a half degrees, and latitude forty-six degrees forty-three minutes. It is said that in its regions are one hundred thousand tents of the Turkomans; horses, hacks (workhorses), mules, and slaves are brought from them. Between it and Sinop (Sinub), the famous port to its east in whose sea is the fleet of the Sultan of Konya, is three days. It is where longitude is fifty-seven degrees, and latitude forty-six degrees forty minutes. East of it with a tilt to the South is the city of Amasya, one of the cities of the wise men. It is famous for beauty and abundance of waters, vineyards, and orchards. Between it and Sinop is six days. The road to it is in the Pine Mountains; all are timbers and waters descending from these mountains. Construction timber is cut for the arsenal of Sinop. The River of Amasya passes the city of Amasya and pours into the Sea of Sinop. East of it is Samsun (Simsun), one of the famous ports of Rum; a river with many mills cuts through it. It is where longitude is fifty-nine degrees twenty minutes, and latitude forty-six degrees thirty-eight minutes. East of it, extending from West to East along the coast of the sea, are the Jatik Mountains (Pontic Mountains?). In them are rebellious barefoot people professing Christianity. South of these mountains is Erzurum (Arzan al-Rum), mentioned in the Sixth Clime. From Amasya, mentioned previously, to the city of Niksar in the South and East, is eight farsakhs, all mountains with timbers, flowing springs, and valleys. From Niksar to Comana (Kamnah) is eight farsakhs. From Comana to Tokat (Tuqat), one of the famous lands of the Sultan of al-Durub, is five farsakhs. From this castle to Sivas, mentioned previously, is six farsakhs. East of the Jatik Mountains on the River of Sinop is the city of Trebizond (Atrabzand). It is a famous port intended by the novelties of the non-Arabs for its markets from various regions. Most of its inhabitants are from the Kabkaz (Caucasus). South of it, extending to the East, is the Great Mount Kabkaz; it is called the Mountain of Tongues due to the many languages therein. It is a mountain connected to Mount al-Bab. Most of the Kabkaz are Muslims who perform Hajj, and among them are Christians. The location of their city Trebizond is on the sea where longitude is sixty-four and a half degrees, and latitude forty-six degrees sixty minutes. East of it is the city of Alkasa (?). They are a race of Turks who converted to Christianity and became urbanized. Its location is on the sea, where longitude is sixty-six degrees, and latitude forty-six degrees fifty-three minutes. East of it is the city of Adhkashiya, inhabited by a people of the Adhkash; they are of Turkish races who became insightful (Christianized/civilized?) by neighborliness. It is on the sea, where longitude is sixty-seven degrees thirteen minutes, and latitude forty-six degrees forty minutes. East of it on the sea is Abkhazia (al-Abkhaz), the port of the Georgians (al-Kurj), who are Christians. Its location is where longitude is sixty-eight degrees eighty minutes [sic], and latitude forty-six degrees. East of it on the sea is Alania (Alaniyah), a city inhabited by people of the Alans, who are Turks that converted to Christianity. Its location is where longitude is sixty-nine degrees and minutes, and latitude forty-six degrees. The Alans are a large multitude in that direction and behind Bab al-Abwab (Derbent). Neighboring them are a people of the Turks called the As (Alans/Ossetians), of similar manner and religion. East of Alania, on a bay at the end of the Sea of Sinop, is the city of Khazaria, attributed to those whom the Rus annihilated. This sea may be called the Sea of the Khazar (Caspian) in relation to it. It is where longitude is seventy-one degrees, and latitude forty-five degrees thirty minutes. It is on a river pouring into the sea from its north.",

    "text": "Part Five: The first thing you meet in it is Mount Qabaq (Caucasus). In it, where one can penetrate to the North, is the Wall built by Anushirwan, King of the Persians, between the Sea of Tabaristan (Caspian) and the Sea of Sinop (Black Sea). In this Wall, gates were built, said to be seven, for every nation of the nations north of this Wall. On it is a fortress with guards who used to prevent the nation adjacent to that gate from entering the lands of the Chosroes. The greatest of these gates is the Iron Gate (Bab al-Hadid), known as such until now. On the turn of the mountain beside it is the Fortress of the Alans, one of the fortresses of the world, veiled by clouds. It is where longitude is seventy-three degrees twenty-four minutes, and latitude forty-five degrees forty minutes. It is said the Tatars suffered hardship against it and did not take it except by trickery after a time. What is north of this Wall today is in the domain of Ibn Barkah (Berke Khan) of the Muslim Tatars. What is south of it belongs to Ibn Hulawun (Hulagu), Sultan of the disbelieving Tatars. The capital of these Gates and their sultanate is the city of al-Bab (Derbent), previously mentioned at the end of the latitude of the Sixth Clime. The River Atil (Volga), which splits the city of al-Bab, occupies the width of this Seventh Clime. East of it is the Sea of Tabaristan. Located in this part is the Island of [...]; they are four islands in this sea, length about one hundred miles. Its eastern end is where longitude is eighty-one degrees, and its width about fifty miles. East of this sea are domains of the 'Arabah of the Turks. East of them in this part is half of the Lake of Khwarizm (Aral Sea) previously mentioned. The mouth of the Sayhun falls into it at a third of the Clime's width. Part Six: The first thing you meet in it is Mount Asgharun, long and high, from which snow never leaves. It extends to occupy the length of this part. Rivers descend from it to the great River Atil, flowing in its north with the end of the Seventh Clime's width and outside it. South of it is the Wall known as [...] built by Muslims in the face of the disbelieving Turks in the North. It extends from the bend of the Sayhun to the Mountain of the Gate of Al-Fadl bin Yahya, about twenty-seven days. It has three fortresses at its end and middle. Part Seven: Has no mentioned city; it is merely domains for types of Turks on the River Sayhun from its south and River Atil from its north. Part Eight: The first thing you meet in it is the source of the Sayhun, exiting from a lake, part of which is outside the Seventh Clime to what is behind it in the North. The source is from the east of the lake where longitude is one hundred and thirty degrees. The lake is round, its length like its width about a degree. East of it is the source of the Atil from the Sahrujiya Mountains, where longitude is one hundred and thirty-two degrees, and latitude with the end of the Seventh Clime. Then it arcs to what is behind it, then straightens passing through it, having inlets and outlets until it pours into the Sea of Tabaristan. East of it are the Sahrujiya Mountains, connected to the Mountain of Kashmir. From there it tilts to the Great Mountain called the Chain of the Earth (Silsilat al-Ard), until it occupies the length of this part winding in it from the southern corner to the northern corner, until connecting with Mount Quqaya. Part Nine: Has no habitation; rather, it occupies entirely the lands destroyed by Gog and Magog before the building of the Dam. At its end is the mountain surrounding them. Part Ten: Entirely behind the mountain in the land of Gog and Magog. At its eastern end, the Great River of Gog pours into the Ocean in the East. The Inhabited World North of the Seven Climes. The latitude at its end from the beginning of habitation in the South is eighty degrees, and from the Equator sixty-four degrees. Its width is sixteen degrees. Habitation is not possible after it in the North because the sun does not rise on that side. Part One of the Inhabited World Behind the Climes: The first thing you meet in it in the Surrounding Ocean, in the West, is the Island of Britain (Britaniya). Its beginning from the South and West is where longitude is nine degrees from the direction of the Eternal Islands, and latitude with the end of the Seventh Clime. Then the sea enters it about a degree and a third, then returns to the line of the Seventh Clime. This sea exiting from the Surrounding Ocean is called the Sea of Britain. It surrounds this island from its south, and the Surrounding Ocean from the rest of its sides. It has an entrance left to the land of Andalusia from the southeastern side at the end of this part. The distance of this island in length is eighteen days from the southern side, and its width about eleven days in the middle. It has no waters except from rain. It has a separate king; his capital is the city of Bristol (Bristal), where longitude is thirteen degrees, and latitude forty-nine degrees forty-two minutes.",

    "text": "Part Two of the Inhabited World Behind the Climes: The first thing you meet in it is the Island of Ballah (?). It is small and inhabited; war occurs over it between the Ruler of England and Britain, because it is between the borders. Its length from North to South, deviating to the East, is about one hundred miles. It is said there are trees in it from which birds like chickens emerge; this is widespread among the Franks, like the widespread talk of sheep emerging from gourds among the Turks. East of this island is the Island of England (Inkalitrah). Its ruler is the Inkitar (King of England), mentioned in the history of Salah al-Din during the wars of Acre. His capital is the city of London (Landras), where longitude is twenty-two degrees twenty minutes, and latitude forty-eight degrees fifteen minutes. Part of the island falls inside the Seventh Clime. It has large cities and obscure settlements unmentioned among us. The length of this island from South to North, deviating West and East, is about four hundred and thirty miles. Its width in the middle is about two hundred miles. In this island are gold, silver, copper, and tin. It has no vineyards due to severe frost. Its people carry the essence of these minerals by sea, enter France with them, and exchange that for wine. The Ruler of France has abundant gold and silver only from that. Among them, high-quality scarlet cloth (al-Iskarlat) is made. In this island are sheep with fine wool like silk; they place coverings on them to protect them from rain and dust. Despite the wealth of the Inkitar and the extent of his kingdom, he acknowledges the Sultanate to the French King (al-Fransis). If there is a gathering assembly, he serves him by placing a bowl of food before him; it is an inherited custom. North of England and some of northern Britain is the Island of Ireland (Irlandah). It enters Part One and Part Two. Its length distance is about twelve days, and width in the middle about four days. It is famous for many seditions. Its people were Majus (Vikings/Pagans), then converted to Christianity following their neighbors. Much copper and tin are also brought from it. In the North of this Second Part is the Island of Jirmuniyah (?). Its length is twelve days, and width in the middle about four days. Good falcons are brought from it. West of it is the Island of White Falcons (Iceland/Greenland?). Its length from West to East is about seven days, and width about four days. From it and the small northern islands, falcons are brought which are carried from there to the Sultan of Egypt. The fee for one emerging from his treasury is one thousand dinars, and if they bring it dead, he pays them five hundred dinars. They have the White Bear; it enters the sea, hunts fish, and snatches what remains or what these falcons neglect. That is their livelihood, as they (falcons) do not fly there due to intense frost. The skins of these bears are soft. On the Surrounding Ocean in this part is Ghuraz (?), capital of one of the Kings of the Slavs (Saqalibah) towards the West. The Germans, Hungarians, and Bashqirs have taken over all the lands of the Slavs. This city is famous, fortified in the middle of a large salt lake; it is only entered via a constructed bridge. It is where longitude is thirty-four and a half degrees, and latitude behind the Clime is eight and a half degrees. East of it, among the capitals that belonged to the Slavs then were taken by the aforementioned, is Kuwiyatiyah (Kuyavia/Kiev?). It is said it belonged to the greatest of the Slavic kings described with greatness. Its harbor in the Surrounding Ocean is intended; large ships gather in it. It is the best harbor of that direction. It is said it has twelve gates. East of it, among the capitals of their kingdom, is Sasin (Szczecin?), on the Surrounding Ocean.

    "text": "Ten days east of Sasin is the city of Mashqah (Moscow?). Its ruler was of the Slavs, with a vast kingdom and huge army. It is where longitude is forty-three degrees, and latitude eight degrees from the Seventh Clime. Located in this part is the City of Women. Deserts surround it. It is where longitude is forty-four degrees, and latitude nine degrees from the Seventh Clime. No king rules them but a woman. They have slaves (Mamluks) in those deserts. When it is night, every slave knocks on his mistress's door and spends the night with her. At dawn, he returns to his place. If the woman gives birth to a boy, she kills him; if she gives birth to a girl, she keeps her alive. No man appears in their land at all. In the Surrounding Ocean in this northern direction is the Island of Women. Its length from East to West deviating South is about two hundred and fifty miles, and its width in the middle about one hundred and twenty miles. Its center is where longitude is thirty-eight degrees and latitude sixty degrees from the Equator. East of it is the Island of Men. Between the two islands is a strait ten miles wide. The length of the Island of Men from West to East is about two hundred and seventy miles, and width in the middle about one hundred and seventy miles. The men do not meet with the mentioned women except one month in the year, which is their time of equinox. The men ride in boats to the Island of Women; each man knows his woman. He lives with her for the duration of the month, then returns to the Island of Men. If the woman bears a male, she raises him until he reaches the age of men, then sends him to their island. If she bears a female, she settles her with the women. East of these two islands is the Great Island of the Slavs. There is no habitation in the Surrounding Ocean behind its east or north. Its length is about seven hundred miles, and its width in the middle Ocean about three hundred and thirty miles. It contains mountains, rivers, cities, settlements, and many people. It is said they remain on Majusiyya (Paganism) and fire worship; they see nothing of greater benefit than it, especially when frost descends upon them. Crops in this island and the like are not reached by the sun; rather, they grow by smoke and proximity to fires. The author of the Geography of Ajar mentioned that there are people in it whose heads are fused to their shoulders, and they mostly live in trees, hollowing them out and entering them. The capital of this island is the city of Barghadna (Novgorod?), by which the Barghar (Bulghars?) are named; it is said their origin is from this city. It is on the Surrounding Ocean where longitude is forty-five and a half degrees, and latitude fifty-seven degrees. The last point the Surrounding Ocean appears is the end of this part in the East; that is at the end of habitation in the North. There is the city of the Barus (Prussians?), a fierce nation more ignorant than the Rus. The Rus are east and south of them. In books, their faces are like dogs, which is proof of bravery. It is said one of them goes out to the army and fights alone until killed, out of recklessness and daring towards death. In this part are many obscure lands on the bank of the River Danast (Dniester), one of the world's great rivers. Its source is from the Great Mountain of the Slavs winding with the Surrounding Ocean until connecting with the Greatest Mountain known as Quqaya. The first island in this river is where longitude is forty-two and a half degrees and latitude fifty-four degrees thirty minutes. It passes west about a month, then twists east. Between the two arms remains a long wide island containing many settlements and cities. It continues east until it pours into the Sea of Sudak (Sea of Azov/Black Sea), about one hundred miles remaining between it and the completion of this part. As for the River Danbus (Danube), which the Turks call Tana, it divides when approaching the Sea of Sudak into six branches. All pour into close places where longitude is forty-eight degrees thirty-seven minutes. The last of them pours to the North, where longitude there is forty-nine and a half degrees. The Danast pours into the north of the mentioned sea where longitude is fifty-two degrees and latitude fifty degrees. After that, it goes west to where longitude is twenty-eight degrees, then goes east. Part Four of the Inhabited World Behind the Climes:",

    "text": "The first thing you meet in it among famous ports is the city of Sudak (Sudak). Its people are a mix of nations and religions, but authority there returns to Christianity. It is on the Sea of Nitish (Pontus/Black Sea), in which merchants travel from it to the Gulf of Constantinople. In its direction from the southern side is the city of Sinop, the famous port. The width of the sea between them is about two and a third courses. The location of Sudak is where longitude is fifty-six degrees and latitude fifty-one degrees. East of it is the entrance of the Sea of Manitish (Maeotis/Sea of Azov) from the Sea of Nitish mentioned before. Its width is about thirty miles, and its extension from South to North is about sixty miles. Then the sea widens, becoming about two and a third courses wide from West to East, and about one hundred and sixty miles from South to North. In it are islands inhabited by the Rus; thus it is called the Sea of the Rus. They are now on the Christian religion. A river exiting from the large Lake Tana pours into the north of this sea. On the side of this river, on the western bank, is Rusiya (Russia), the capital of the Rus. They are a large multitude, and there is length in their faces. This city is where longitude is fifty-seven degrees thirty-two minutes, and latitude fifty-six degrees. It has many obscure cities on the Sea of Nitish and Manitish. East of it is the large Lake Tuma. Its length from West to East is about six hundred and thirty miles, and its width in the eastern land is about three hundred miles. In its center is the Island of Alis, about one hundred and fifty miles long and seventy miles wide. In it is a formidable fortress on a mountain containing the treasuries of the Sultan of the land of the Tuman. In it today are the monies of the son of Berke. It is where longitude is sixty-six and a half degrees and latitude fifty-six degrees thirty-eight minutes. This island was attributed to [...] because it is found in it; it is an animal resembling the lion in strength. Many rivers descend into this lake; Al-Bayhaqi mentioned they exceed one hundred rivers. The largest is River Tanabris (Dnieper), long with a large flow, on which are many settlements of the Bulghars and Turks. On this lake are many cities and abundant settlements. Most of its inhabitants are Bulghars (Volga Bulgars), most of whom are Muslims, and among them are Christians. The famous capital in this region is Tuma, to which the lake is attributed. It is where longitude is sixty-nine degrees and latitude fifty-three degrees twenty-seven minutes. South of it towards the Sea of Nitish are the Boxwood Forests (Shi'ra' al-Baqs); from it, it is brought to all regions of the world. It is amazing that it is small in distance, width and length, yet supplies the lands of East and West due to the growth and speed of regeneration God Almighty placed in it. East of these forests on the sea is the city of Matrakha (Tmutarakan). It has lands and a king independent by himself. It is on the eastern corner of the sea in the North, where longitude is fifty-one degrees. Located in the north of this Fourth Part is the famous city of Saqsin, where longitude is sixty-seven degrees and latitude fifty-three degrees. East of it is the city of Sud, also famous and added to it. East of Saqsin is the city of Qaraghat, where longitude is seventy-eight degrees and latitude fifty-three degrees. East of it is Bulghar (Bolghar), a city of wood, where longitude is eighty-two and a half degrees and latitude fifty-three and a half degrees. Part Five of the Inhabited World Behind the Climes:",

    "text": "The first thing you meet in its south is the City of the Throne (Madinat al-Sarir), capital of the land of the Throne (Sarir - Avar Kingdom). One of the Chosroes had placed a throne there for one of his relatives and made him deputy in that direction, so it was known as the Land of the Throne. Its people are a mix of Arabs and Turks. It is where longitude is seventy-four degrees and latitude fifty degrees thirty-one minutes. It is on a mountain connecting to the Mountain of Tongues (Caucasus) where the Gates are. From this mountain descends the River of Sheep (Nahr al-Ghanam), pouring into the Sea of Khazaria (Caspian) east of the city of Matrakha. It is large, bearing loads in winter, and animals cross over it (when frozen). South of it pours the Small River Atil, coming from towards the Great Atil, passing south of the River of Sheep. Between them remains an island about three stages wide. The army of Hulagu had crossed these two rivers to fight the army of Berke. Berke's army defeated them, and they drowned upon their return in the first River of Sheep. Then those who survived drowned in the other river; they crossed it on ice, and it collapsed with them. It is said that armor and helmets are brought out from these two rivers to this day. East of the City of the Throne is the city of Burtas, capital of this race of Turks, where longitude is seventy-six degrees and latitude fifty degrees fifty-two minutes. It is on the edge of the great Mount Qarmaniya, circling from its north about thirty-eight days to the side of the River Tanabris. From it, many rivers descend to Lake Tuma. Burtas has many domains on the River Atil east and south of them. East of Burtas is a large inlet from the Sea of Tabaristan. East of it is Lake Mazgha; its circumference is about eight days. Many rivers descend to it from the great Mount Asgharun curving over it from the Seventh Clime. The great River Mazgha exits from it (the mountain) and pours into it (the lake), and a river exits from it pouring into the long River Atil. On this mountain in this part is the Fortress of Dandara; in it, the King of Burtas keeps his stores, and from it, he raids the 'Arabah and those Turkish races camped around this lake. It is where longitude is forty-seven and a half degrees and latitude fifty-one degrees. Also on this mountain is the Fortress of Darmu; in it, the King of the 'Arabah keeps his stores, and from it, he raids the Burtas and others. It is at the end of the longitude of Part Five, and latitude fifty degrees fifty-two minutes. In the north of this part is the course of the great River Tanabris. On it is the city of Saqsin previously mentioned; in it now is the son of Berke, King of the Muslim Tatars, and it has madrasas and mosques. Part Six of the Inhabited World Behind the Climes: Has no mentioned town nor famous landmark. In its south is the long River Atil. In its north passes the River Tanabris, which pours into Lake Tuma from the high Humpbacked Mountain connected to the Great Mountain extending with the end of habitation in the North. That is where longitude is one hundred and seven and a half degrees and latitude sixty-one degrees. South of this mountain is Mount Arstana (?), extending from East to West; two large rivers descend from it to the River Atil. Part Seven of the Inhabited World Behind the Climes: The first thing you meet in it is Mount Asqasiya, extending from North to South. Three rivers descend from it to the long River Atil. In the directions of this mountain is the land of Qumaniya (Cumans). They are of the Turkish races; they have interest in stars and occupation with their judgments, and they worship them. They have in this part Lake 'Unqur (?). Its length from East to West deviating South is eleven days, and its width four days. Mount Taghura, capital of the Qumaniya, surrounds it from the West. It is where longitude is one hundred and sixteen degrees and latitude fifty-five degrees. It has cities on the rivers descending from this mountain and on the lake, with obscure names.

    "text": "The first thing you meet in it is the Mountain of the Pechenegs (Bajnak). It traverses from North to South. Two rivers exit from it; the northern one goes west forming a lake about one hundred miles in circumference. On its western side is Bajnakiyah, the capital of the Khagan of the Pechenegs. They are a nation of Turks who burn themselves and burn whoever falls to them. This city is where longitude is one hundred and twenty-five degrees and latitude fifty-five degrees. It is located at the end of the previous part. The Pechenegs have a second mountain curving from the Seventh Clime, passing connected to the Sahrujiya Mountain. A river descends from it to a lake; its width is one hundred miles, and likewise its length. On it and on the mentioned river are cities of the Pechenegs with obscure names. From this lake exits a river passing west to another lake at the city of Tayghuwa (?). It belongs to a king of the Pechenegs; the ruler of Bajnakiyah fights him, although the Khaganate among them is hereditary in his offspring. It is where longitude is one hundred and thirty degrees and latitude fifty-two and a half degrees. East of the Pechenegs is the Stinking Land (al-Ard al-Muntinah); no one can traverse it except with good scents, and it is empty. North of it is the land of Sahrat; they are disbelievers, no one enters them except they kill him. Part Nine of the Inhabited World Behind the Climes: The first thing you meet in its south is the Excavated Land (al-Ard al-Mahfurah). It is round; its width is four days and likewise its length.
