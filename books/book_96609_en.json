    "text": "Qaws al-Nur (1)\nPraise be to Allah, the Bestower of blessings and their Sustainer, and peace and blessings upon the Guide of creation and their Intercessor. To proceed:\nThe books of Abu Hafs al-Sayrafi were until a few years ago considered non-existent. No one knew of them, nor sought guidance to them in any way, nor did anyone rise to search for them, thinking they were rarer than the eggs of the Anuq (a mythical bird) or the ablq 'aqq (a mythical piebald horse), and then due to the overwhelming despair of finding them, given the long time that has passed between us and the last possessors of them or those who referred to them... However, a measure of abundant grace kept a solitary copy of the book of Al-Ilal (Defects) for a long period of time sitting in the library of Ibn Yusuf in Marrakesh under number 684. Individual scholars and the general public would pass by it morning and evening. They never paid attention to it, nor gave it its due care. The lack of a title on the collection diverted them from examining it and gaining insight into it. It is the nature of people to be reluctant to endure difficult paths and to be fond of the easy route, especially that whose veil has been lifted and whose brilliance has appeared; because it relieves them from the distress of choice and its difficulties - and not everyone is praised for their exploration. So you see them rushing for that reason to work on a single book, one of them uncovering it like moths rushing to a flame. If they had the capacity to search for this abundant, rare, hidden material that was unknown, this scrambling would not have occurred, nor would they have disputed the book with its owner who was exhausted from searching for it and was the first to present it, nor would they have intended to steal it or almost did so... And in that lies a waste of effort and time by converging on a work where gathering is not required, and an indication of thinness in religion and boldness in fabrication, which does not suit this noble and lofty science.",

    "text": "This book is not one whose value is hidden, as it is evident in several matters:\n- It is the third book on Al-Ilal (Defects) - after the books of Ali bin al-Madini (d. 234 AH) and Imam Ahmad (d. 241 AH) (1) - to be found and unveiled for the first time, after remaining in the realm of the lost for many centuries. Its Andalusian transmission chain (Isnad) and Moroccan manuscript and origin make it the only one in the world, as far as I reckon.\n- It is one of the most precious critical artifacts of the school of Imam Al-Bukhari's sheikhs, in the first half of the third century; as it contains the most famous critical opinions of the two great Sheikhs of Basra, Yahya bin Sa'id al-Qattan and Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi. It is thus considered the most extensive single compilation gathering their statements (2).\n- It retains a detailed, indicative, and rare title: \"A Book Containing the Defects of Hadith and the Knowledge of Trustworthy Jurists from the Weak, as Agreed Upon by the Scholars of Basra\"; in addition to the issues it raises regarding the methodology of classification; such as its singling out the distinction between trustworthy and weak narrators specific to a certain region like Basra.\n- It is a model that reveals the early signs of establishing the historical method among the Hadith scholars in Basra, and the climate of issues that were prevalent there.\n- It contains many texts and athar (narrations) unique to it, not found elsewhere; thus, they are among its exclusive contents.\n- Comparing its texts with what was transmitted from it resulted in correcting many attribution errors and adjusting some critical judgments.\nOne of the most difficult things we encountered in this part was that the author wrote it specifically for a particular recipient at a particular time, presupposing a set of technical and methodological competencies, and a degree of knowledge of texts, issues, and technical assimilation. This led him to fold...",

    "text": "...the contexts of texts and be concise in mentioning the Mutun (texts of hadith), sometimes shortening them and sometimes sufficing with a part of some without completion, especially in what he narrates as accounts of the critics' gatherings. As you know, these are sources of issues circulating among the people of the craft, containing abbreviation, referral, implication, limiting to the Kunyas (nicknames) and mere names of narrators, abridging texts and hinting at them with the heads of issues, sending terminology that had not yet become doubtful, establishing critical judgments with phrases folded away from circulation, and citing the Isnad (chain of narration) stripped of its Matn (text) relying on its fame at the time, while it is not famous today. If a confusing misspelling or a hidden omission is added to the above, understanding the intent becomes even harder to reach and rarer to grasp. For example, he narrated from his Sheikh Al-Qattan that he used to say regarding the pledge (Rahn): If it is worth more than its value, it is for what it is worth, and if it is less, the surplus is returned to him (1). In this issue, there is obscurity caused by brevity necessitated by the fame of the issue at the time; its detail is: \"Regarding the pledge: it perishes in the hands of the pledgee; if its value and the debt are equal, it is lost against the debt, and if its value is less than the debt, it is returned to him\" (2). This is not something grasped intuitively. Among the difficulties of verifying this book is also the hesitation in considering what constitutes a single sentence or multiple sentences from the author's speech; for some paragraphs contain a critical judgment on a narrator deserving to be singled out with a special number, and sometimes some relate to a question or issue concerning multiple examples. Is it permissible to single them out because each is a specific issue, or is it permissible to combine them due to the semantic thread that organizes them? One of the results of examining the correction of the book was that one of the aids in understanding the context of the reported news, especially in criticism, is seeking it from various sources, not just one. For the story narrated - for example - from Yahya al-Qattan, you might find it narrated attributed to Ibn...",

    "text": "...Al-Madini or Abu Musa al-Zaman or Al-Fallas or Bundar... And it is necessary that one of the predecessors be more comprehensive and explicit in mentioning what unveils the ambiguity of the meaning than others. One of the sources of the report might add a necessary addition without which the meaning would not be clear. So comparing their speech with one another is an investigation to understand the climate of the text in which it was produced. The prevailing opinion - based on induction and repeated examination - is that if the heritage of many of Al-Fallas's contemporaries, like those we mentioned, had reached us, we would have found that one of them alone carries the bulk of their narration and transmits, following their example, what they transmit, so nothing remains for each of them to be unique in except a little thing (1). We reached this conclusion after pausing often at news and texts in Abu Hafs's book that were only illuminated by the narrations of his peers and contemporaries in Iraq specifically. This is what we might call the common amount in narration usually produced by the unity of Sheikhs, time, and place. Therefore, the meaning produced by projecting a text onto another text on its subject - provided the conditions of reliability are met for both - is more correct and precise than the meaning produced by reading an isolated text, no matter how armed the reading is with sound mechanisms. One of the benefits of the book of Al-Ilal is that it determines where the author's speech ends, to distinguish it from the speech of those who transmitted from him; because some of the critical texts that originally return to him, parts of them are usually attributed to their transmitters, especially if the transmission is long, so it is thought at first glance that only its beginning belongs to Al-Fallas without the rest; as in the report related to the mursal (disconnected) narration of Ibn Jurayj (2). It is known that correcting the text without commenting on it is an elegant escape from responsibility, but it is...",

    "text": "...a missed opportunity for two great matters: practicing understanding the issues of the texts, and revealing them to students. So whatever commentary I made on the texts of the book is from this category. It is axiomatic that correctness may be my ally occasionally and oppose me more often, and in both cases, I resort to a sound intention and a high aim, God willing. perhaps a reader perusing this work might whisper to himself: How excessive this investigator has been upon himself, and how much he has obligated himself unnecessarily, and these papers are barely fit to become a volume. To this type and others, I say: Suffering through the texts of early critics is not that easy. A word might strike the illusion of a hasty reader as deviating from correctness, and consequently, he suggests returning it - arbitrarily - according to his claim to the modern usage, which is the face his view has settled on and his knowledge has reached. Thus, he corrupts the original without restraint. His ignorance of what that word meant at the time it was said, due to its gradual withdrawal from circulation over time, is what led him to this. If he had lingered for a while and consulted the class of works corresponding in art and history, they might have illuminated his path and corrected his stumble. He errs who thinks that these texts brought by the author are compliant in revealing what is in them. They require profound knowledge of the sum of issues that were current in the arena of Hadith, the Mutun (texts) that were circulating, and a sharp perception of the specific circumstances and contexts that govern a particular critical issuance. What I have described is what made me fear most that I might underestimate opposing the texts of the book with what is transmitted from them, even if by a later scholar, thus missing a hidden correctness or an alert from an intelligent person. For the investigator, no matter how high his ranks in the craft, does not pay attention to all the dilemmas of the copy except with a notification from abundant guiding copies. If they are lacking, quotations from the original - if found - take their place, although this is one of the necessities committed, due to the varieties of alteration that usually befall the transmitted material. As for our method in Takhrij (referencing), it is pointing to the face mentioned by the author...",

Whatever is in the transmitted sources from the author's path, I do not include in the Takhrij at all, but rather refer to it to correct the text and document it. I was active - at first thought - in collecting the critics' statements on the narrators disagreed upon mentioned in this part, and I covered a not short distance in that, especially when the names of these interspersed the issues of history and defects at the beginning and middle of the book. But when the majority of the issues at the end of the book became specialized in talking about them, and it appeared that the footnotes were dominating Al-Fallas's text and strangling it, and the commentary became undutiful to its origin, I desisted from my initial course. I limited myself to referring for each narrator to two books that gathered and contained everything, namely Tahdhib al-Hafiz al-Mizzi and its Ikmal by Al-Hafiz Mughlatay. In them are gathered transmissions and rare imports that are not hidden from scholars. It was decided by me not to annotate the text with the transmission of critical judgments except for a group of critics united by a specific time frame, which is the time of Al-Fallas or shortly after him. So these transmissions do not go beyond the layer of his Sheikhs, peers, and students, either originally from their books or through other trusted intermediaries even if they are late. Necessarily, seeking familiarity with these judgments, whether confirming what we have or differing from it, is more beneficial in discerning the scientific atmosphere and the climate of issues than the judgments of later scholars, which are nothing more than a probed reading of the total judgments they encountered. Their ijtihad framed by the rules of the art led them to a choice or preference that usually became binding only in the absence of foundational books or their loss or lack of trust in the transmitter from them.

    "text": "...what resembles it if found - it is from the foundational period, so it is absolutely incorrect to judge what is in it except by what corresponds and resembles it at the level of structure and significance. We were called to this methodological limitation - although we did not succeed in applying it consistently due to its extreme difficulty - by the attempt to foresee the thinking patterns of the third-century Hadith scholars, and to smell the issues that contributed to building their judgments, whether doctrinal, ideological (1), or technical. This is not, God forbid, a burying of the serious scientific accumulation of later scholars nor neglecting it, but rather an intent to become saturated with the spirit of these texts on the day they were produced, by \"temporarily\" (2) detaching from the authority of later readings. For applying the judgments of \"Al-Taqrib\", for example, arbitrarily on the narrators of this part, completely removes the desired benefit from it; because we thereby waste the opportunity for utilization and scientific independence in knowing the principles, rationale, and evidence for adopting such judgments by a great critical scholar like Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him. Such practice is what made the critical aspect in the science of Hadith wither as much as possible. If we hoped for the book to guide us to the paths of those early ones, let your thoughts not go elsewhere. I declare my innocence to Allah, may His power be exalted and His name be high, from intentionally disparaging an Imam of Hadith or one affiliated with it, except what the pen swerved to without my intent. For speaking against the bearers of the Sharia of the Messenger of Allah is severe, and its consequence is dire. And if we have any status - and I do not think so - it is by the honor of our affiliation to them and our declaration of their virtue. \"We seek refuge in Allah from deficiency after increase.\" This said, whoever engages in Hadith today meets difficulties, due to the lack of his group, the loss of discussion in it, the weakness of benefit in engaging with it, and the delay in sparking understanding for the one involved in it except after a long time, due to its reliance on deferred [reward/result], so it does not produce immediately.

There is no doubt that the line uniting them was what they both emulated from the path of righteousness and seeking integrity, even if they were together peers in weakness and abandonment (1) - each according to his [degree]!.. Since it was not transmitted to us that he was stigmatized with any of the beliefs of the Mu'tazila (Adliyyin), perhaps he accompanied Amr before the doctrine took hold in him, or before he raised his head with it. He also had a connection with Al-Mansur before he assumed the Caliphate, either independently or through Ibn Ubaid, as indicated by a report cited by Al-Baladhuri from Al-Tawzi, from Abu Zaid; he said: \"Al-Mansur came to Basra before the Caliphate, so Amr bin Ubaid said to Bahr bin Kanz (2) al-Saqqa: This man has arrived, and he was a frequent visitor when he came to our city, so let us go to him. So they came to him; when they stood at his door, Amr called out: O girl. A girl answered him, so he said: Tell Abu Ja'far: Abu al-Fadl and Abu Uthman.

It also implies that Bahr was among Al-Mansur's acquaintances as well, otherwise he would have named him. Since he used his Kunya, it is known that it was familiar to Al-Mansur. Considering that Bahr died in the year 160 AH (1), he lived through twenty-two years of Abu Ja'far Al-Mansur's caliphate. I do not think that in all of them he was someone accustomed to standing at his door, unless the Caliph initiated contact with him due to old acquaintance as he used to do with Amr bin Ubaid and cajoled him, without gaining anything from him. He is the one who said about him:\nAll of you are seeking prey ...

This, while contrary to custom, obliterated the mention of his father and draped curtains of neglect over him, so we know nothing about him except that his name was Ali, and nothing beyond that. However, I later found in a unique place Al-Fallas naming his other grandfather in Al-Dulabi's Kunab (5) where he said: \"Amr bin Ali narrated to us; he said: My grandfather Abu Sufyan Salih bin Mihran narrated to me - and he was trustworthy - ...\".

    "text": "...Akhbar Asbahan by Abu Nu'aym (1), and it does not contain \"my grandfather\". His student Al-Nasa'i narrated it from Al-Fallas in Al-Sunan al-Sughra (2) and Al-Kubra (3), stripped of the addition in both places. This Abu Sufyan Salih bin Mihran is a Shaybani from Isfahan, a freedman of Zakariya bin Masqalah bin Hubayrah al-Shaybani, then he is of Khurasani origin, and was called: Al-Hakim (4). If the authenticity of the preceding addition is established - and there is some doubt about it - it would result in Al-Fallas's grandfather being a client from Isfahan, who came (or his son Ali came) to Basra and settled there, and this one proposed to Bahr bin Kathir for his daughter, so she gave birth to Amr... (5). Between Al-Fallas's grandfathers on the father's and mother's side are common denominators not hidden from one who examines their biographies (6), except that Al-Fallas declared the first trustworthy and weakened the second. Perhaps in the suspicion of Al-Fallas's knowledge of Persian, there is something to support correcting the addition, for this knowledge would be easy if he were of Khurasani origin since that is the language of the land. We only based this suspicion on a single misspelled report cited by Ibn Abi Hatim in the entry of Umar bin Riyah Abu Hafs al-Darir; he said: I heard my father say: Abu Hafs al-Sayrafi said: \"Hawrad\"\" (7). I said: Perhaps he meant \"Huwa: Rad\" (He is: Rad), and \"Rad\" is a Persian word meaning: Rejected. But this possibility is somewhat strained.\n4 - His relationship with Yahya al-Qattan and his reverence for him:\nAl-Fallas's intense adherence to Yahya appeared in various matters, including seeking his approval for what he transmitted from him in his books over what he transmitted from others; and his narration from him of some of his usual phrases and answers outside the path of the art (of Hadith), related to his person only. He liked to praise him; he mentioned in his book that he narrated a hadith to him and he approved of it (1), and informed him of another and he approved of it as well and asked him to repeat it more than once (2). He was persistent in his questioning, yet he would not get annoyed with him but would oblige him, as in his saying: \"I asked Yahya about the hadith of Thawr, from Hariz, from Abu Khidash. He said to me: Mu'adh heard it from Hariz, so ask him about it. But I did not leave him until he narrated it to me\" (3). He never ceased to be concerned with transmitting Yahya's positions on various issues; such as his position on the preference between Ali and Uthman (may Allah be pleased with them); as revealed by this report: \"I heard Mu'adh bin Mu'adh say: Shu'bah narrated to us, from Husayn, he said: I said to Abu Wa'il: Is Ali better or Uthman? He said: Ali; until he did what he did. But as for today, it is Uthman. Mu'adh said: So I narrated it to Bishr bin al-Mufaddal, and he said: Uthman was better before and after. So Yahya got angry and said: This one did not know Umar bin al-Khattab, when he made it a consultation (Shura) among six!\" (4). In this, there is a denial and refutation by Yahya of this speech using the action of Al-Faruq, may Allah be pleased with him, for if a preference had appeared to him, he would not have resorted to the Shura. So it appeared that Ali and Uthman (may Allah be pleased with them) are to Yahya like two racehorses or like the two knees of a camel; or withholding judgment (Tawaqquf), and this is what is famous about him. Abu Zakariya Yahya bin Ma'in said: \"Yahya bin Sa'id said: Sufyan al-Thawri's opinion was: Abu Bakr and Umar, then he would stop (Tawaqquf). Yahya bin Ma'in said: And it is the opinion of Yahya bin Sa'id\" (5). As for his politeness with him, it is proverbial; suffice it to say that prominent figures would stand before Yahya for long hours, not daring to sit unless he permitted them. Al-Khatib narrated from Ishaq al-Shahidi his saying: \"I used to see Yahya al-Qattan pray Asr and then lean against the base of the minaret of his mosque. Ali bin al-Madini, Al-Shadhakuni, Amr bin Ali, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Yahya bin Ma'in and others would stand before him; asking him about Hadith, and they...",

He said: What is dearest to me is what is dearest to Allah!\" (2).\nWhat distinguishes Al-Fallas from those who transmitted Al-Qattan's sayings on narrators and defects, is that he narrated from him many of his jurisprudential choices and fatwas and was unique in transmitting them. He mentioned that he used to raise his hands in every lowering and raising (in prayer). And that his knees would touch the ground before his hands (3). And that he would not perform ablution from what fire had changed (cooked) (4). And that he disliked all Nabidh (fermented drinks) (5).

And Al-Fallas asked him about a man who left out a prostration from a rak'ah, then remembered it while he was in the second.

He said: She (9) is in postpartum bleeding (Nifas). And he transmitted from Yahya his resentment of the Imamate of the Qadariyyah, and labeling them as performing prayer badly (10), and similar instances recurred for him, such as his saying: \"Yahya saw me once while I was coming from the direction of the mountain after we had prayed Fajr. He said: Where did you come from here? I said: I did not catch the prayer with them, so I prayed in this mosque.

An illustration of this is that we have only managed to name a few of his friends that can be counted on the fingers. We identified among them - with difficulty - Abu al-Adhan Umar bin Ibrahim, a Baghdadi whom Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi described as Al-Hafiz (1); nicknamed so due to the largeness of his ears, and his kunya was Abu Bakr (2). He died in the year 286 AH (3), so he would be from the layer of students of the Sheikh, closest to his heart like a companion. Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Bakhit said: \"I asked Amr bin Ali, while he was leaning on a man's hand... Then I accompanied Abu al-Adhan Umar bin Ibrahim on the road to Mecca, so he said to me one day: Do you remember the day you asked Amr bin Ali... while he was leaning on a man's hand? I was that man...\" (4). As for Abu Qatadah, about whom Ibn Abd al-Barr said: \"A companion of Amr bin Ali al-Bahili al-Sayrafi, he heard from Asim al-Kuzi\" (5); he is known yet unknown, and we did not find anything to clear the obscurity of ignorance about him, for this Al-Kuzi was a fabricator whom Al-Fallas himself disparaged (6). Imam Ahmad was of his generation. I do not know how his connection with him was, and there is no doubt that they met in various gatherings, including the one that brought them together to learn from Ibn Mahdi. They both alluded to one of those gatherings; Amr bin Ali said about it: \"I heard Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi, and he mentioned Ibn Abi Adi and praised him well, and looked into a book of his with me containing [narrations] from Ja'far bin Maimun...\" (7).

I say: You see that Ibn Hanbal was vague about the owner of the book when his son asked him about it, and referred to him as \"another person\"; perhaps he just didn't mention him at the time, for Al-Fallas was one of the famous figures of Basra. I don't know the reason for the vagueness, although Imam Ahmad only mentioned our companion in his 'Ilal' twice, naming him in one and using his kunya in the other (2).\n6 - His stance on Abu Hanifa:\nAbu Hanifa was one of the pillars of Opinion (Ra'y) and proponents of Irja', and the Hadith scholars considered him weak in Hadith. Thus, he received considerable criticism from them for this reason. Others, claiming jurisprudential bias, went beyond criticism to demolition. Sheikh Abd al-Rahman al-Mu'allimi al-Yamani, may Allah have mercy on him, undertook the refutation of these aimed arrows on the path of fairness in his comprehensive book \"Al-Tankil\" in the most creative and extensive manner possible, establishing valid criticisms and rebuttals that cannot be repelled, and contextualizing much of it. Al-Fallas was among the group who directed this scorching criticism, but it was not an individual stance; rather, it reflects the viewpoint of the entire Basran school, as it has many parallels. Here is the context of his words, stripped of commentary except for a small slice: Amr said (3): \"And Abu Hanifa the proponent of Opinion, his name is Al-Nu'man bin Thabit, is not a Hafiz (memorizer), confused in Hadith, flimsy in Hadith.\" And he added in Tarikh Baghdad (4): \"And a proponent of desire (innovation).\" And he said (5): \"Abu Ghadir al-Filastini narrated to me, a man informed me that he saw the Prophet, peace be upon him...",

His student Ibn Abi Khaythamah witnessed a similar situation—when the Sheikh arrived in Baghdad at the end of his life and narrated there at the Khorasan Gate—he said: '...When morning came, people gathered around him and lifted him onto a roof. The first thing he narrated to us was: So-and-so son of so-and-so narrated to us seventy years ago. He said: So-and-so narrated to us—to his companion—seventy years ago.

    "text": "...the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, married Maymunah while he was in Ihram.' Abu Hafs said: When it was later, he said: 'from Aisha'; so I said to Abu Asim: You dictated it to us from the notebook, and Aisha is not in it. He said: Leave Aisha until I look into it! Look at his precision as he remembered the hadith recalling how he received it from his sheikh by dictation. And also from him; his saying: 'I heard a trustworthy man from our companions say: I heard Yahya bin Sa'id say in his prostration: \"O Allah, forgive Khalid bin al-Harith and Mu'adh bin Mu'adh.\" So I mentioned it to Yahya, and he did not deny it.' In this, Al-Fallas was not content with the narration of the trustworthy person from Yahya until he heard it from him directly, even though he could have dropped the intermediary, yet he did not do so, which indicates his investigation. Indeed, this deep scrutiny in controlling the origins of narration appears in some of his stories in this part; like his saying: I heard a man asking Yahya about the hadith of Abdullah bin al-Sa'ib, from Zadhan regarding trustworthiness. Yahya said to him: It is from Sufyan and Al-A'mash; so which of them do you want? He said: The hadith of Al-A'mash. He said: You want the name! I heard Sufyan say: I went with Al-A'mash to Abdullah bin al-Sa'ib until he heard it.' His story showed that Sufyan preceded Al-A'mash in receiving the hadith of Abdullah bin al-Sa'ib, and he was the one who guided Al-A'mash to it. This precision, investigation, and perception is what he expressed as 'insight into hadith' in his critical judgment on Abu Hudhayfah Musa bin Mas'ud when he said about him: 'No one who has insight into hadith narrates from him.' 9 - Description of the last dictation session held by Al-Fallas one day before his death: From the manuscript 'Al-Fawa'id al-Muntakhabah wa al-Hikayat al-Mustaghrabah' by Hafiz Ibn Bashkuwal (d. 578 AH); he said:",

He said: And he used to narrate to us in the grand mosque. If he dictated a page to us, it was as if he had done a great work with us. Then one day he sat for us until Zuhr, then he said to us: Whoever has blank paper [let him use it], otherwise let him leave some of what he has with the grocer and take blank paper, then return. So we returned to him, and he dictated to us until Asr, then he said: Pray and sit. I said: The Sheikh has a story! So we sat until Maghrib, then he said to the dictation assistant: Tell the people to be silent. So the people were silent. Then he said: I saw last night in a dream the Lord of Glory saying: Leave it tomorrow in peace. When it was tomorrow, we came rushing and he had passed away, may Allah have mercy on him.' In this report, despite its brevity: Al-Fallas's scarcity in dictation sessions, that his students used to write, and that they were so numerous that a dictation assistant was needed with them; and in it are glad tidings of Al-Sayrafi seeing the Lord of Glory in a dream, His speaking to him, and informing him that his departure from the world would be in peace, then the confirmation of the vision by his death at the time he was informed. Among the narrations of Al-Fallas in the last years of his life is what Al-Khatib cited with his chain to him; he said: Abu Hafs Al-Fallas Al-Basri said in the year forty-nine in Surra Man Ra'a: 'Yahya bin Sa'id al-Qattan narrated to us, Abd al-Malik bin Jurayj informed us, from Ata; he said: Ibn al-Zubayr sent to Abdullah bin Abbas - and the relationship between them was good - saying: Indeed this Eid...",

    "text": "Glimpses of the Book and its Methodology 1 - Is this the Book of Weak Narrators (Kitab al-Du'afa)? One of the cautions of mentioning 'weak narrators' in the title of this book of ours is that one who contents himself with it without the rest of the author's books might imagine it to be the one frequently mentioned in the folds of books on narrators under the name 'Al-Du'afa' or 'Tad'if al-Rijal' (Weakening of Men), which is also implied by the phrase of Ibn Khalfoun al-Awnabi: 'And he has a book on the weak narrators of Basra.' However, the distinction between the books of 'Al-'Ilal' and 'Al-Du'afa' is established. The least that suffices to prove it is that Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi possessed both books and arrived with them in Damascus, naming them without combining them; rather, he mentioned the second one later than the first with two titles. Perhaps the Book of Weak Narrators is more comprehensive than our book, which Al-Fallas restricted to the trustworthy and weak narrators of Basra, in addition to mentioning issues of defects ('Ilal); so it is not purely for weak narrators, evidenced by the fact that much of Al-Sayrafi's speech on weak narrators is not contained in the part before you. Furthermore, the sayings of Al-Fallas transmitted from him outside the books of History and 'Ilal are more indicative of his personality in Jarh and Ta'dil (disparaging and declaring trustworthy), and they are lengthier and broader in their apparent freedom from mere transmission and his boldness in criticism, unlike what is in the Book of 'Ilal, where he adhered strictly to narrating from his sheikhs only, adhering to his condition which he elaborated in the long title of the book, which is referring to the sayings of the sheikhs of Basra. Adding to the evidence of the complete distinction between the two works, Ibn Khayr al-Ishbili (d. 575 AH) distinguished between them; and his transmission of them with two distinct chains; he said regarding 'Tad'if al-Rijal':",

    "text": "Among those observations: b - Mentioning Fiqh (Jurisprudence) in Hadith: There occurred in this part what justifies naming the jurists in the title; from Hudhayfah bin Asid who said: 'I saw Abu Bakr and Umar not sacrificing; intending that it be followed as a Sunnah. Then I came to you and you carried me to harshness after I understood (faqit) the Sunnah.' Abu Ali al-Farisi cited the phrase for example, stripped of attribution, in Al-Hujjah regarding the Almighty's saying: {And they could hardly understand (yafqahuna) a word} [Al-Kahf: 93]. Everyone who narrated the words of Abu Sarihah said: 'I knew ('alimtu) the Sunnah,' and none of them followed Al-Fallas on 'faqit' - so it is unique to him - but it is indicative and straighter than its sister; and it contains an early appearance of the term 'Fiqh al-Sunnah'. It appears that the closeness between the muhaddith and the faqih was intense to the point of confusion, so the first is not mentioned in the classes of men without mentioning the second, as with Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Khayyat, and Ibn Zanjuyah in their lists of classes. Perhaps our companion followed this path as well, so he devoted a chapter in the History to mentioning those of the jurists of Basra who died, most of whom named in its folds are people of Hadith. He said in another report: I heard Azhar al-Samman say: Muhammad bin Amr came to us, and no one stayed behind from him, and I did not hear a letter from him. And I saw the senior companions of Hadith; I saw Hammad bin Salamah, Hammad bin Zayd, and the jurists of Basra and the sheikhs of Basra with him. Furthermore, the relevance of mentioning jurists in the book's title is founded on the fact that the part contains jurisprudential issues of Yahya and matters related to hadiths that circulate among jurists and not others, as is known by browsing it.",

It was followed by books with a more general meaning that did not reach us; such as Akhbar al-Basra by Umar bin Shabbah, and Ibn Abi Khaythamah, and these are not thought to be limited to clarifying the sayings of Basra scholars alone. In this singling out in this manner is an elevation by the author of his city, raising the status of his sheikhs, and an acknowledgment from him of the custodians of the science of Hadith among them; meaning: Shu'bah, Yahya, and Abd al-Rahman. The Basrans were known for caution in narration and investigating wordings, to the point that Imam Ahmad said: 'I have not seen a people with black heads in this matter like the people of Basra - meaning: Hadith and wordings - as if they learned it from Shu'bah.' The great critics like Ibn al-Mubarak realized this matter, for Ibn Mahdi said to him: 'The people of Kufa do not have insight into Hadith. He said: How so?!' Then he met him after that and said to him: 'I found the matter as you said.' Abu Abd Allah explained it by saying that they used to ask him about the opinion of Hammad and Al-Zuhri, and the hadiths of the younger ones. It is noticed that Abu Hafs means by Basrans those who were originally from Basra or came to it or died there among those who were not originally from its people, so there is leniency in designating Basrans, as their name applies to Kufans, Mosulis, and others who came to Basra and its vicinity. He cited a report from Al-Mughirah bin Ziyad, and this is a Mosuli. Similarly, he mentioned Abu Ma'shar Najih bin Abd al-Rahman al-Sindi, who is Medinan.

The author quoted from his Basran sheikhs: Yahya bin Sa'id al-Qattan, Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi, Mu'adh bin Mu'adh al-Anbari, Sulayman bin Dawud al-Tayalisi, Umayyah bin Khalid, Affan bin Muslim, Salm bin Qutaybah, Yazid bin Zurai', Abd al-A'la bin Abd al-A'la al-Sami, Muhammad bin Ja'far Ghundar, Ibrahim bin 'Ar'arah, Abdullah bin Salamah al-Aftas, Al-Dahhak bin Makhlad, Ziyad bin al-Rabi', Muhammad bin Abi Adi, Maymun bin Zayd al-Adawi, Hisham bin Abd al-Malik al-Tayalisi, Bishr bin al-Mufaddal al-Raqashi, Azhar bin Sa'd al-Samman, Abd al-Wahhab bin Abd al-Majid al-Thaqafi, Mu'tamar bin Sulayman al-Taimi, Safwan bin Isa al-Zuhri, Ubaidullah bin Abd al-Majid al-Hanafi, Hatim bin Wardan, Hayyan bin Abdullah al-Darimi, and Mu'adh bin Hisham al-Dastawa'i...

From what has passed, we understand the author's intention from his phrase: 'upon which the scholars of Basra agreed', and yet there is undoubtedly leniency in it; because the author's main reliance is on his two sheikhs Yahya and Abd al-Rahman, and their share of the book's narrations is large and preponderant, unmatched by any other share, so the consideration is predominant.",

We expected him to break free from the source of narration for a moment, by releasing himself from the restriction he committed to in the History, but it turns out that this characteristic is general in what has reached us of his books. Al-Fallas once said to Abu al-Adhan Umar bin Ibrahim: 'You do not do anything well except with a chain of narration (Isnad).' How worthy he is of this phrase, for it is firmly established in him. You can verify this by the fact that the Book of History did not contain disparagement (Jarh) or declaration of trustworthiness (Ta'dil) for narrators except regarding two specifically: Abu Aqil Bashir bin Uqbah al-Dawraqi, and Yahya bin Mutawakkil, the companion of Bahiyyah; the first is trustworthy and the next is weak. Although books of history were not purely for this, we found early authors touching upon some issues of Jarh and Ta'dil in them and scattering criticisms and preferences within their folds. Indeed, some expanded to limit history to that, like Ibn Ma'in, and some narrowed its scope to names and kunyas like Al-Muqaddami the Younger; and many achieved the concept of history by combining matters between that, like Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him. clearer than what has passed is that you will not find along the extent of the book purely Amr's words; rather, everything in it is either narrated or recounted. It suffices to indicate that, that the phrase 'I heard' is not absent from any page of this part, repeating one hundred and ninety-one times (191). b - Inclination towards brevity and economy in narration: This scarcity appears first in the list of his books, for we have not obtained...",

Then brevity appears in the volume of what reached us of his books, the largest of them being three parts, and its peer being one part. Following Ibn Khayr's habit of indicating what implies he examined the book he received the right to narrate, or possessed or handled, his saying about Amr's book 'Tad'if al-Rijal': 'A small part'; therein is another indication of what we said. As for moderation in narration, it is indicated by the fact that he was not known for proliferation, so only one part of his hadith is known, nor did he exceed the limit of moderation in narrating from the two Sheikhs, although if he had done so, the witnesses of the examination would have supported him; Abbas al-Anbari said: 'If Amr bin Ali narrated thirty thousand from Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi, he would be believed.' And deeper in clarification is what Hafiz Ibn Bashkuwal cited in his 'Fawa'id': 'Sahl bin Nuh al-Janani the muhaddith in Basra said: I used to write from Amr bin Ali al-Fallas; he said: And he used to narrate to us in the grand mosque. If he dictated a page to us, it was as if he had done a great work with us.' c - Quality of classification: Perhaps in Abu Hatim's word about Al-Fallas that he is more elegant (arshaq) than Ibn al-Madini, there is...",

    "text": "what tends to make it specific to the quality of classification only - this is if the differing stances of the two men regarding the inquisition of the creation of the Quran did not affect this judgment, for Ibn Abi Hatim quoted from Al-Fallas's books more than three times what he quoted from Ali's books, aided by the important quotes therein, to issue that judgment which baffled many. As for thinking that Ibn Abi Hatim considers Al-Fallas more knowledgeable than Ibn al-Madini, it is farfetched, and people are equal in rejecting it, their beginners and the accomplished, and above what we said, it is not consistent with his subsequent statement: 'Basran truthful.' What supports what we said is that the later generation of the ancients saw in Al-Fallas a superiority in quality of arrangement and good composition. Al-Ramhurmuzi (d. 360 AH) said: 'I heard someone mention that the classifiers are three; he mentioned Abu Ubayd al-Qasim bin Salam, Ibn Abi Shaybah, and mentioned Amr bin Bahr in his meaning'; which is a word of merit in what we aimed for. 4 - Habits of the Author in the Book: The author observed hidden links and arrangements in the method of classification; among them: - Mixing between historical discussions and discussions of defects ('Ilal). - Observing the similar and analogous narrators in the layer (Tabaqah), by age or condition of weakness or trustworthiness, even if implicitly: Example: The discussion about Ajlah comes after the discussion about Fitr; and in the reason for linking this report to the one before it is a point; which is that Fitr was compared to Ajlah; Abdullah bin Ahmad said: 'I heard my father say: How close Al-Ajlah is to Fitr bin Khalifah.'

    "text": "composition. However, gathering the statements of Imams regarding both - even if they are close - shows that Fitr's condition is better than his peer's condition, and Allah knows best. From Al-Fallas's understanding is that he paired the judgment of the two Sheikhs on Al-Muthanna bin al-Sabbah with their judgment on Talha bin Amr, since they were often compared to each other by the ancients like Ibn Ma'in, who was asked about Al-Muthanna and said: Weak in hadith, he is stronger than Talha bin Amr. Although these two share in weakness, the first is considered for his hadith unlike the other. This comparison is clear in his quoting Yahya saying: 'Abd al-Wahid bin Qays, about the age of Al-Awza'i', and Al-Nazzal bin Ammar in age, like Imran bin Hudayr. I say: The aspect of comparison between them is that Imran bin Hudayr is among the narrators from Al-Nazzal, and his being of his age and peer group is one of the benefits of the book, which I did not find in others. - Citing the report of the narrator immediately after the one who narrated from him sometimes: From it is that he mentioned the report about Yahya al-Jazzar after his report about Amr bin Murrah; and in the reason for linking this report to its predecessor is a subtlety, which is that Amr bin Murrah narrates from Yahya bin al-Jazzar, see an example of his narration from him in Musnad Abu Ya'la. - Artistry in Isnad, by citing the same report with different chains according to different sessions: An example is his saying: 'I heard Yahya say: I heard Sufyan say: They wanted Abu al-Bakhtari al-Ta'i to employ him on the day of Jamajim over the Quran readers, but he refused and said: I am a man from the Mawali, and I do not know how to shake the sword. So they employed Zahr bin Jabalah bin Zahr; and he did not leave until he was killed.' Then he cited it with an Isnad from another path: 'And I heard Umayyah bin Khalid...",

Related to this point also is that Al-Sayrafi mentioned it with a more complete context in the Book of History, and with a briefer context in Al-'Ilal, and I fear that a transposition occurred to him, attaching the Isnad of the first to the text of the second or vice versa as appears by comparison. - Distributing a single report between two places, citing it completely in one and summarizing it in another: Like his advancing the report of Al-Qawariri asking Yahya about Mujahid's saying in {O Mary, be devout to your Lord} [Al Imran: 43] and summarizing it, then delaying Mujahid's explanation of the verse and detailing its report later. In this regard, the author had a common amount of reports between History and Al-'Ilal, and that is a clear indication of the original variance between the two works. - From Al-Fallas's methodology - a path followed by Al-Uqayli, Ibn Adi and others - is that he alludes to a characteristic of the narrator or a judgment, then follows it with an example of his narration: Example: His talk about the manner of updating of Awf bin Malik al-Jushami, then citing a narration of his from Abdullah bin Mas'ud afterwards. The text of Amr's words: 'And I heard Abu Dawud say: Shu'bah narrated to us, he said: I said to Abu Ishaq: How did Abu al-Ahwas narrate to you?

He said: So they mentioned once at Yahya's in the Grand Mosque on Friday - and I was witnessing - rest (Tarwih) in prayer; so he said: They mention from Muslim bin Yasar and Abu al-Aliyah. So Affan al-Saffar said to him: From whose hadith? He said: Hisham narrated to us - then he said to him between him and himself while I was listening - from Abd al-Karim, from Umayr bin Abi Yazid - between him and himself... As for Abd al-Rahman, I asked him in the gathering about a hadith from the hadith of Muhammad bin Rashid, from Abd al-Karim, and he said: Leave it! When he stood up, I hoped he would narrate it to me; so I asked him about it and he said: Then where is piety (Taqwa)!' - Transitioning from explicitly stating the critical judgment to its implication, or to what indicates it, or to the state surrounding the critic when mentioning him: Like Al-Fallas saying: 'Yahya bin Sa'id, if Abu Bakr bin Ayyash was mentioned in his presence, would frown and turn away,' while he said on the other hand: 'And Abd al-Rahman used to narrate from him.' - Linking judgments on narrators with their causes: Whenever the cause of disparagement is examined, the clarification is better for verifying whether the cause is impugning or not. Some judgments in the book were coupled with their causes; and they revolved around: Extremism in Rafd (Shia rejection): 46. And Nasb (hatred of Ali): 1.

The author might confront you with the critical text abruptly without introduction or appending, and there is no guide to take by the hand to the straightest path and the safest way, and on this norm are most of the books of the ancients, so they compel you forcibly to review the sources and question them to decode the obscure and highlight the implicit. If you succeed in finding what you seek, you have secured the calamity and imitated the exemplary ones, and if you do not find, you exert your mind as much as you can and establish what Allah opens up.

This became established in critical convention among the ancients and moderns alike, rather their narrating from an unknown person lifts the obscurity from him and validates him, for Ahmad was asked: 'If Yahya or Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi narrates from an unknown man, is his hadith used as proof? He said: It is used as proof.' They did not differ about them when they both narrated from a narrator or abandoned him, but they differed if one narrated and the other abandoned; Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abi Bakr al-Muqaddami quoted Ali Ibn al-Madini saying: 'If Yahya bin Sa'id and Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi agree on abandoning a man, I do not narrate from him, and if they differ, I take the saying of Abd al-Rahman; because he is the more moderate of the two, and there was strictness in Yahya.' Al-Dhahabi said about them: 'They undertook the criticism of men, and suffice you with them in majesty, nobility, knowledge, and virtue. So whomever they disparage, by Allah, his wound hardly heals, and whomever they deem trustworthy is the accepted proof, and whomever they differ upon, effort is exerted in his matter, and he descends from the degree of Sahih to Hasan, and they have deemed trustworthy...",

No wonder the critics distinguish the two peers with this methodological characteristic; for in addition to their refraining from narrating from weak narrators, they used to track their narrations in the books of their students and mark them as errors; as Bundar recounted, he said: 'Yahya and Abd al-Rahman took the pen from my hand, and crossed out about forty hadiths from the hadith of Al-Harith from Ali.' The matter reaches with the two Sheikhs to the point that they would complain against whoever did not cease narrating from those perished ones whom they both agreed to abandon, recounted by Abu Dawud who said: 'Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi complained against Isa bin Maymun, the companion of Muhammad bin Ka'b, regarding these hadiths, so he said: I will not return [to it].' This practice of the formula of negating the narration of the two Sheikhs or affirming it became a trodden path in the layer of the author and the layer of his students, and from them those after them picked it up, so you find it with Imam Ahmad and the philosopher of the craft Ibn al-Madini - and he dedicated a separate work to this in five parts which did not reach us - and Muhammad bin al-Muthanna al-Anazi - and I think...",

The book 'Al-'Ilal' remains for now the widest corpus of this formula reaching us, and the value of the quotes does not appear only in recounting the agreement of the two Sheikhs or their difference in narrating from some narrators or abandoning them, but also in what it describes of the development of critical monitoring they had for a number of narrators; such as Al-Fallas's saying about Jabir al-Ju'fi: Yahya and Abd al-Rahman do not narrate from him, and Abd al-Rahman before that used to narrate to us from him then abandoned him.' And he said similar to that about Qays bin al-Rabi'. And he negated their narration from Amr bin Ubaid and stated afterwards: 'And Yahya used to narrate to us from him then abandoned him.' And he reported that they abandoned narration from Isma'il bin Abd al-Malik, and said: 'And I saw Abd al-Rahman saying: I ask Allah for guidance to strike out his hadith.'",

However, it is not consistent with our companion to accept everything he recounts about the two Sheikhs, nor do I think he considered the mere narration of one of them - without them both - from a narrator as validation absolutely, evidenced by his saying: 'And Yahya narrated to us, from Bakr bin Khunays' then Amr said following it: 'And he is weak', so if his acceptance of mere narration was decisive he would not have commented, or perhaps he meant that Yahya's narration was discussion (Muzakarah) not transmission (Riwayah). There is no doubt that his saying: 'And people differ about him' - after saying: 'I heard Yahya and Abd al-Rahman, both narrating from Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Aqil': does not impugn for him the principle of argumentation with what the two Sheikhs agreed upon, so the addition is merely recounting a situation, and does not result in his adopting a critical judgment contrary to the two Sheikhs. The ideal value remains for what the book 'Al-'Ilal' contained of recounting about the two peers, in its correction of some of what was transmitted from the two Sheikhs - outside Al-'Ilal - incorrectly, resulting in confusion in the critical judgment attributed to them, and also in establishing the truth regarding those narrators who underwent critical monitoring, so they narrated from them at first then...",

The editor voweled the Kaf in both cases with Damma (Kull), and it appeared to me at first that it was a misspelling (Tashif), and that it is more worthy that the voweling be with Fatha (Kall), so the meaning would be that so-and-so is weak and only takes from his like; derived from the saying of Allah Almighty: {And he is a burden (Kall) upon his master; wherever he directs him, he brings no good} [Al-Nahl: 76]; but what returned me to the right path is the author's saying afterwards: 'And he praised him', which is an indication diverting from the immediate meaning; not to mention that Ibn Juhada is from the narrators of the group (Jama'ah) and not weak at all. However, despite that, the expression 'Kull la ya'khudh illa 'an kull' remains furthest from the spirit of the Muhaddithin, rather it is closer to the spirit of the theologians (Mutakallimin), in addition to being an unheard expression, as we did not find it with other than Abu Dawud despite extensive searching, and it is likely that what is in the transmissions from the book of Al-Ajurri is better if it were free from confusion; for in 'Tahdhib al-Kamal': 'Kana la ya'khudh illa 'an kull ...', and he did not complete it, and it is in Tahdhib...",

    "text": "Tahdhib': 'He would not take from just anyone.' I suspect it underwent alteration in it. Despite all this, the expression remains obscure, needing decoding. Phrases like the one that passed are often problematic, and their inherent indication is not definitive; rather, they require external direction to set their context and define their concept. We do not lack such expressions from Yahya and Abd al-Rahman in the book 'Al-'Ilal'. Among them: Yahya: 'This is from the old (Atiq) hadith of so-and-so': In a predominant context, this phrase may mean the inclusion of the intended hadith in the narrations of the narrator before his confusion (Ikhtilat), and thus the judgment of its acceptance, as in the context of Yahya's saying about a hadith of Ibn Abi Arubah: 'This is from the authentic hadith of Sa'id, and from his old hadith.' However, Yahya's use of the phrase in various situations led to the conclusion that it is not always governed by the aforementioned context. It might be used with no effect on the acceptance of the hadith and trust in its transmitter, or distinguishing between two phases of his life; as is clear in Al-Fallas's saying: 'And I heard Yahya mention Ubaydah bin Mu'attab, so he narrated from him the hadith of Abu Ayyub, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, who said: \"Whoever prays four before Zuhr...\" Then he saw me writing it, so he said: \"Do not write it; indeed, it was from his old hadith\".' Ibn Ma'in alluded to the same meaning we mentioned; in the book 'Al-Du'afa'' by Abu al-Qasim al-Balkhi, Abu Bakr said: 'I asked Ibn Ma'in about Ubaydah, the companion of Ibrahim? He said: Weak, he is nothing. I said: What about whoever heard from him long ago? He said: He is nothing, recently or long ago.' Yahya: 'So-and-so was not on the coin (Sikkah)': This phrase is unique to Yahya and not transmitted from anyone else. Al-Fallas said:",

And Yahya bin Sa'id mentioned him and said: \"He was not on the coin (Sikkah)\".' The meaning of the phrase: The critics tested Al-Hasan bin Salih bin Hayy as a dinar is tested, and he was found counterfeit, or that he departed from the upright, beautiful, satisfactory state to crooked, impassable paths. No wonder Yahya described him as such, for he used to abandon Friday prayer and held the view of the sword (rebellion), we ask Allah for safety. 'Al-'Afw' (Pardon/Ease) according to Yahya: Al-Fallas said: 'And I heard Yahya bin Sa'id say: I used to take the pardon ('Afw) in Hadith.' I say: Perhaps the meaning is: He used to take what the narrator's mind allowed freely without initiating him with a question, insistence, or annoyance; as understood from Yahya's saying: 'I never spoke to Ash'ath, and I only took his pardon (what he gave freely).' The term 'Al-'Afw' may mean the opposite of strictness, and this is realized by comparing it to a question by Ali Ibn al-Madini, for he said: 'I asked Yahya about Muhammad bin Amr bin Alqamah, how is he? He said: Do you want pardon or strictness? I said: Rather, strictness. He said: Then he is not whom you want. He used to say: Our sheikhs are Abu Salamah and Yahya bin Abd al-Rahman bin Hatib.

    "text": "in delivering his narration. And second: Lack of strictness that exceeds the limit of moderation in accepting the narrator's narration. Ibn Mahdi: 'So-and-so is among those who increase in goodness': Some reports point to specific issues or terms like the term 'stability of the trustworthy narrator'; meaning: the narrator remaining in a beautiful state, and his safety from what happens to him that corrupts his precision or integrity; as in Al-Fallas's saying: 'And I heard Abd al-Rahman mention Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad, so he said: He was among those who increase in goodness.' This report of Ibn Mahdi indicates the good condition of Abd al-Wahid, and Abu Dawud's saying about him: 'He intended to hadiths that Al-A'mash used to obscure (Yudallis) and connected them,' removes him from that state of Tadlis. Rather, Yahya denies him knowledge of Al-A'mash's hadith entirely, in his saying: 'I never saw Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad seek hadith at all, neither in Basra nor in Kufa. We used to sit at his door on Friday after prayer, and discuss Al-A'mash's hadith, and he did not know a letter of it.' However, this story does not yield Yahya's weakening absolutely, so Mughlatay criticized Ibn al-Jawzi for understanding from it that 'Yahya weakened him.' Yet, Abd al-Wahid's knowledge - even some knowledge - of Al-A'mash's hadith cannot be denied, for Imam Ahmad used his corroboration to correct Masruq's narration from Al-Mughirah. If he were completely devoid of knowledge as Yahya's story implies, Ibn Hanbal would not have considered him in corroboration, and that is evident from his saying: 'I heard Yahya bin Sa'id when the hadith of Al-A'mash, from Muslim, from Masruq, from Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah was mentioned in his presence. Yahya said: Masruq from Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah?! - twice or thrice - and Yahya denied it most intensely. Abdullah bin Ahmad said: I said to my father: Who corroborated him?",

    "text": "He said: More than one; I think among them is Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad...'. Reconciling these stances is possible if we consider a time gap between them. Each of them described the reality of the narrator's matter at his time. So Al-Qattan's words when discussing Al-A'mash's hadith with Abd al-Wahid are interpreted as being at the beginning of his era with narration. Abu Dawud's words about his Tadlis are interpreted when his condition improved in it and he ascended in knowledge and trustworthiness. And Ibn Mahdi's stance is interpreted when he deserved to be 'among those who increase in goodness', thus transforming from the weak to the trustworthy, and in this is an invalidation of Yahya's stance. In the phrase above, there is a clear stipulation of the cause of the critical revision, for he expressed it in the present tense which indicates his increase in goodness and his persistence in it. It cannot be said: This phrase is not a text in the point of dispute; because it is a value judgment unrelated to narration; because we say: It notifies the hypothetical recipient of the transmitter's knowledge of the judgments of preceding critics. Therefore, he did not say 'there is goodness in him', nor 'there was goodness in him', because that involves refraining from explicit declaration, suitable for the continuation of what was as it was - i.e., in weakness - so it does not indicate an elevation in condition. Thus, his choice of the phrase is intentional as produced by the styles of Arabic. It remains that Ibn Mahdi's phrase regarding Ibn Ziyad might be interpreted - contrary to what passed - as referring to righteousness and worship. The term 'Trustworthy' (Thiqah) according to Ibn Mahdi is relative and cannot be generalized: Al-Fallas said: '... I heard Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi ... say: Abu Khaldah narrated to us, from Abu al-Aliyah ...; a man said to him: Was he trustworthy? He said: He was truthful (Saduq), and he was chosen (Khiyar), and he was trustworthy (Ma'mun). The Trustworthy (Thiqah) are: Shu'bah and Sufyan.' Among Ibn Abd al-Barr's criticisms is his saying following it: 'This has no meaning in the choice of words, and interpretation in it is according to desire.' And Al-Baji said: 'He only intended...",

If none of the Hadith scholars were deemed trustworthy except those at the level of Shu'bah and Sufyan al-Thawri, the trustworthy ones would be few and most traditions would be nullified.' Thus, it appears that applying such distinctions is relative and not subject to disciplined logic, and it requires examination specific to each critic individually. While Ibn Mahdi considers the term 'Thiqah' higher than the term 'Khiyar', we find the opposite with Ahmad; as revealed by his answer to Abu Dawud when he asked him about Sayyar Abu al-Hakam: 'Is he among the trustworthy?' He said: 'Yes, and above trustworthy, he was among the chosen (Al-Akhyar).' However, this note is only applicable with the meaning that 'Khiyar' allows for inclusion in the plural 'Al-Akhyar'. Yahya: 'I have seen him': Al-Fallas said: 'I never heard Yahya nor Abd al-Rahman narrate anything from Isma'il bin Rafi'. Yahya said: And I have seen him.' He also said: 'And Abd al-Rahman used to narrate to us from Abbad bin Rashid; and Yahya would say when he was mentioned: I have seen him.' The meaning of this: He is not satisfactory to him; and it involves avoiding explicit declaration of weakness mostly, and an additional meaning: That I abandoned narrating from him deliberately, despite having seen him. This is supported by Al-Bukhari's saying in 'Al-Du'afa'' and 'Al-Tarikh al-Kabir': 'Ibn Mahdi narrated from him, and Yahya al-Qattan abandoned him.' 'Whoever has insight into Hadith': This is one of the phrases indicating one who has realized the description of entering the spaciousness of Hadith, smelling its issues, and understanding criticism.

His counterpart according to Ibn Mahdi is similar; for he said: 'The people of Kufa do not have insight into Hadith.' Yahya: 'Be silent, woe to you': Abu Hafs said: 'I heard Ibrahim bin Ar'arah say to Yahya: Affan narrated to us, from Hammam, from Qatadah, so he said: Be silent, woe to you!' The story is proof of Yahya's bad opinion of Hammam and denial of narrating from him.

He said to him: You narrated to us from Ibn Ajlan, from Amr bin Shu'ayb, from his father, from his grandfather: \"That the Prophet, peace be upon him, forbade forming circles on Friday before the Imam comes out.\" Yahya said: But I saw Hisham, Habib bin al-Shahid, and Sa'id bin Abi Arubah forming circles on Friday before the Imam comes out. He said: So did the news reach these that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, forbade it and yet they did it? So Yahya remained silent.' A second example: Al-Sayrafi's saying: 'I heard a man narrating to Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi from Yahya bin Sa'id, from Ubaydullah, from Nafi', that Ibn Umar used to return [the greeting] just as he was greeted; Abd al-Rahman denied it and said: This is actually the hadith of Abu Ja'far al-Qari. So I mentioned it to Yahya and he narrated it to me. Then I saw Yahya, and behind me was Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi in the Grand Mosque on Friday, and he said: You denied the hadith of Nafi'?! You asked me about it thirty years ago. So Abd al-Rahman remained silent.' Also from him: 'And I asked Yahya about the hadith of Mujalid, from Al-Sha'bi, that Umar, Ali, Shurayh, and Masruq said: No marriage except with a guardian (Wali). He refused to narrate it to me. And he said: Abd al-Rahman forbade me from it. So I said to him: \"But Abd al-Rahman narrated to us from Hushaym, from Mujalid, from Al-Sha'bi\"; so he began to marvel!' I say: Either Ibn Mahdi narrated to Al-Fallas before the prohibition, or he retracted his refusal regarding this specific hadith, due to the existence of a corroborator for Mujalid, for he is weak and what he narrates alone is not used as proof, and he used to accept prompting later - as indicated by a report of the author - not to mention that Abd al-Rahman would not narrate from him from Al-Sha'bi and Qays bin Abi Hazim as in Al-Bukhari.",

    "text": "4 - The emergence of the prominence of Yahya bin Ma'in during the life of his sheikhs: Yahya bin Ma'in was of Al-Fallas's generation and a student of the two Sheikhs, but his superiority over his peers appeared early, and his critical opinions opposing his two sheikhs had an echo in the book. Al-Fallas conveyed a glimpse of that in his book shyly; that is his saying: 'And I heard a man from the people of Baghdad from the people of Hadith - and he is: Yahya bin Ma'in - mention Ibrahim bin Muhajir and Al-Suddi, so he said: They were weak, despicable. Abd al-Rahman said: Sufyan said: Al-Suddi was a man from the Arabs, and Ibrahim bin al-Muhajir had no harm in him.' I say: Perhaps Ibn Mahdi's defense of them - contrary to Ibn Ma'in, and after the necessary critical reason - was due to the nobility of their lineage among Arabs and their politeness with him and his companion Al-Qattan, even if they were Mawalis (clients) - for it was said regarding the first: He is a Mawla of Al-Azd, and regarding the second: He is a Mawla of Tamim. Yahya bin Sa'id's stipulation of this cause supports this in his saying: 'I sought Hadith with two men from the Arabs: Khalid bin al-Harith bin Salm al-Hujaymi, and Mu'adh bin Mu'adh al-Anbari, and I am a Mawla of Quraysh to Taym, so by Allah, they never preceded me to a Muhaddith and wrote something until I arrived.' It has a witness from the saying of Ya'qub bin Sufyan, regarding Ibn Muhajir: 'He has honor and nobility, and there is softness in his hadith.' Furthermore, Ibn Mahdi narrated from Sufyan from Ibn Muhajir. See an example of it in the history of Ibn Abi Khaythamah. And I did not find anyone who addressed this report with an explanation to satisfy me; perhaps it is correct, God willing. Similar to what passed is the author's saying: 'And the man also mentioned Yunus bin Abi Ishaq and spoke about him; so Abd al-Rahman said: There was no harm in him. He said: And both Yahya and Abd al-Rahman narrated to me from him. He said: Yahya heard from him. And Abd al-Rahman, from Sufyan from him.'",

Otherwise, how did Hadith authorship follow winding paths before reaching this degree of blatant maturity, with the generation of Al-Bukhari and his subsequent students? A maturity that manifests through the choice of resources, arrangement of narrators, consideration of narrations, and distinguishing between origins and fragments, what is suitable for the chapter and what is appropriate for commentary (Ta'liq), and what is by way of contradiction, or support, like the Follow-up (Mutabi') and Witness (Shahid)... and so on. Do not think that Al-Bukhari was generous in revealing the secret of his craft and indicating the place of his transparency in it, for he tightly locked the doors between that and his seeker, with extreme brevity, fleeting allusion, penetrating compressed headings, and different intentions concealed in one body... It is incumbent upon whoever seeks to realize that and enters its domains, to pay its dowry, and to show his skill, and to bear heavy burdens of continuous examination if attainment and determination support him, and care and success follow him after that, and before him after that are successive rounds in which he captures the strays and binds the wild ones. Because of what passed, Al-Bukhari deserved to be truly an example of the culmination of knowledge maturity in his generation and the generation of his sheikhs and its guide, so he folded in his great books the knowledge of the great critics from his sheikhs and those before them, whether that which he received by hearing and reading, or that...",

Thus, Al-Bukhari's works deserved to represent the spirit of all the classifications of the second and third centuries. We are not in the process of discussing his apparent or hidden resources in their entirety, for what concerns us from them is only the works of Al-Fallas. The opportunity has enabled us to discern that after we unveiled, praise be to Allah, the Book of History, and followed it in this work with the part on 'Ilal, so what we intended became straightforward for us without others, as there was nothing in hand before by which Al-Bukhari's intakes from books could be distinguished and separated from others. Specifications of Al-Bukhari's quotes from Abu Hafs: The first thing that confronts the contemplator in the totality of quotes from Al-Fallas: a - Their abundance and breadth of arts: Al-Bukhari did not leave any of his books without quoting from Al-Fallas - except the part on Birr al-Walidayn - so he quoted from him in Al-Sahih, the two Histories, Al-Du'afa', Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, and Al-Qira'ah Khalf al-Imam, combining texts, reports, and criticisms. In the indexes of these books is sufficiency from tracking. b - Al-Ju'fi's pride in taking from his sheikh: This is a matter the eye does not miss in the folds of all the books, but some places articulate it clearly, like Al-Bukhari's saying: 'Abu Asim narrated to us; and Abu Hafs bin Ali made me understand some of it from him...' He admitted that he heard the hadith from Abu Asim and did not clarify some of it except with the help of Al-Fallas. Were it not that he takes pride in what he takes from him, he would have folded this detail and remained silent about it, but the etiquette of Muhaddithin in attributing benefits to their owners called him to what you see; and it is a great chapter of veneration; because in it, besides the honor of acquisition, is the honor of affiliation.",

I have found more than one explicit quote from the Book of 'Ilal in Al-Tarikh al-Awsat: 329/3; no. 508 - 443/3 - 444; no. 662 - 553/3; no. 839 - 448/3 - 449; no. 669 - 639/3; no. 985 - 641/4; no. 987. Sometimes the benefit from the book 'Al-'Ilal' occurs without explicit quoting, like his saying in 'Al-Tarikh al-Kabir': 'Al-Fallas said: And I heard Yazid bin Zuray' say: I turned away from Abu Bakr al-Hudhali and Abu Hilal deliberately.' Al-Bukhari dropped the intermediary of Al-Fallas, attributed the speech to him directly, and restricted the speech to Al-Hudhali without his peer. He was more precise in the book 'Al-Du'afa'', so he cited the speech with uncertainty and said: 'Amr bin Ali or someone else said: I turned away from Abu Bakr al-Hudhali deliberately.' Al-Bukhari resorts in some benefits from Al-Fallas to abbreviation, as he did in the entry of Abu al-Ghusn from Al-Tarikh al-Kabir when he said: 'Ishaq, Abu al-Ghusn:",

He said: Make him swear; so he made me swear, and I swore that I sold it and it was not on it. So he validated the sale upon him.' 2 - Types of benefit of authors in 'Ilal from the Book: Rarely is there a reputable book of Rijal except that its authors benefited from Al-Fallas's books directly or through intermediaries. Among these were: Muslim bin al-Hajjaj, Al-Uqayli, Ibn Hibban, Al-Ramhurmuzi, Ibn Adi, Abu Ahmad al-Hakim, Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, and Ibn Abd al-Barr al-Namari... Some of these, like Al-Uqayli and Ibn Adi, sometimes find nothing in the biography except what Al-Fallas reported, so it is taken entirely from him in their view as he is the sole reporter of it; as you find in their books in the entries of Ishaq bin al-Sabbah, Umar bin Shawdhab, Ishaq Abu al-Ghusn, Muhammad bin Abi Adi al-Kufi, and Abdullah bin Uthman bin Khuthaym... We have limited ourselves to exemplifying with two of the pioneers, Ibn Abi Hatim and Al-Daraqutni; for their specialization in writing on 'Ilal, and the clarity of the features of influence in their books: a - Ibn Abi Hatim al-Razi: The first thing related to him is that immense appreciation from his father Abu Hatim for his sheikh...",

    "text": "Al-Fallas, which appears with the easiest contact, for he used to enable him from his 'Ilal book to strike out those narrators not approved of, then he validates Abu Hafs's criticisms in 'Ilal; as he did in this place: 'Abd al-Rahman said: Abu Hafs Amr bin Ali said: The hadith from Abu Umamah, and his saying: \"Al-Abbas informed me\", is the speech of Ibn Jurayj. My father said: It is as Amr bin Ali said.' Abu Hatim's knowledge of Al-Fallas and the style of his sheikh Al-Qattan reached such a point that he would say: This is from his speech and this is not from his speech; therefore he faulted him in a report he cited in his 'Ilal'; his son said: 'I asked my father about a hadith narrated by Abu Hafs al-Sayrafi who said: I benefited Affan: Sufyan narrated to us, from Asim, from Zirr, from Abdullah, regarding the Mahdi. So he narrated it to Yahya bin Sa'id, who said: Not like this do I want, so he prompted him and he accepted the prompting. Then he said: Not like this did Sufyan narrate to us, but there is no harm in it! My father said: How I fear that Abu Hafs erred; this is not Yahya's speech, Yahya was not of the men who say: There is no harm in the likes of this, I do not know where Abu Hafs got it from.' End quote. There is no doubt that this indicates perception and insight into the Sheikh and his books and the criticism issued by him, and certain knowledge of his sheikhs and their terminologies. He was also among those who kept pace with Al-Fallas and his choices, and knew some of his revisions; from that is Abd al-Rahman's saying: I heard my father say: Amr bin Ali al-Sayrafi narrated to us; he said: Abu Asim narrated to us, from Ibn Jurayj, from Abu al-Zubayr, from Jabir: 'That the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, forbade a man to put on sandals while standing, or to wrap himself in the Samman wrap.' I heard my father say: Then Abu Hafs retracted his saying: 'He forbade a man to put on sandals while standing', and he used to narrate it to us in the past. Ibn Abi Hatim's quoting from Al-Fallas's 'Ilal was more in 'Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil' than in 'Ilal al-Hadith', so his quotes came abundant and numerous, reaching 77 quotes; and this is the sequence of their numbers in our book:",

Not all these places are what Ibn Abi Hatim quoted entirely, rather among them are what he quoted in full, what he quoted part of, and what he summarized and modified. Ibn Abi Hatim pursued his way to Amr's book through his father and Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Shu'aib, and scattered much of its material in the folds of his books. It is worth noting that many of the quotes in disparagement from Al-Fallas, which have no trace in the books 'Al-Tarikh' and 'Al-'Ilal', are almost certainly heard by Muhammad bin Ibrahim from the author in sessions, not copied from a book. Ibn Abi Hatim's benefit in the book 'Al-Jarh' - especially in its introduction - from Abu Hafs's book was great, and that appeared clearly in the aspects of the biography of Hafiz Yahya bin Sa'id al-Qattan, and in the chapter 'What was mentioned of Yahya bin Sa'id's speech in defects of Hadith' specifically. Ibn Abi Hatim did not only benefit from Al-Fallas's reports and issues, but followed him in the arrangement of reports, so he quoted them from him sometimes in their order in the original; as is known by looking at their succession in the following list. However, Abd al-Rahman used to change Al-Fallas's phrase when it did not serve the clarity of the intended meaning; as in his changing of Amr's saying: 'From the man who is Wahi...",

From it: That Ibn Abi Hatim intended Al-Sayrafi's saying: 'I asked Abu al-Walid Hisham bin Abd al-Malik about Harb bin Surayj; he said: He was our neighbor, and there was no harm in him, and we did not hear anything from him', so he cut off the last phrase: 'and we did not hear anything from him'; so as not to disturb the intended critical judgment which is the trustworthiness of the narrator, for the lack of hearing from him suggests hesitation in this judgment. However, he mostly intends precision, so he hardly contradicts the author's words. He may gather the disparate words of Al-Fallas about a single opinion in one place then summarize it after that, just as he did with the reports of Abu Bakr al-Hudhali distributed in Al-'Ilal over three places. b - Al-Daraqutni: The greatest author in 'Ilal did not hesitate to mobilize the original books of the art and include them in his book, so Al-Daraqutni benefited from this part of Al-Fallas, explicitly naming him at times, and silent about him at others; and let us suffice with two examples for both cases; from the first, at Abu Hafs's saying: 'And I heard Muhammad bin Abi Adi; he said: Habib bin al-Shahid narrated to us, from Abdullah bin Buraydah, that Sa'd bin Ubadah came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, with a beast, so the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: The owner of the beast has more right to its front.'

From the second; what Ali bin Umar benefited from Abu Hafs and concealed his source in it; at the saying of the original author: 'And Yahya used to avoid narrating from Ali bin Zayd; so I asked him once about the hadith of Hammad bin Salamah, from Ali bin Zayd, from Uqbah bin Sahban, from Abu Bakra, from the Prophet regarding his saying: {A multitude from the former peoples} [Al-Waqi'ah: 13], he said: \"Hammad bin Salamah narrated to us, from Ali bin Zayd, from Uqbah bin Sahban, from Abu Bakra, from the Prophet\"; then he abandoned it.' Looking at it is Al-Daraqutni's saying: 'Khaqan bin Abdullah bin al-Ahtham narrates it, from Ali bin Zayd, from Ibn Sahban, from Abu Bakra elevated (Marfu'), and Hammad bin Zayd narrated it, from Ali bin Zayd, from someone who heard Abu Bakra halted (Mawquf), and it is not established, and Khaqan is not strong, and Yahya al-Qattan had narrated it, from Hammad bin Salamah, from Ali bin Zayd, from Uqbah bin Sahban, from Abu Bakra, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, then he abandoned it.' I say: Were it not that we came across Al-Fallas's words, identifying the origin of Abu al-Hasan's speech would have been obscure to us.",

While Ibn al-Qattan (d. 628 AH) quoted from it in his comprehensive explanation, it did not happen for his countryman after him Ibn al-Mawwaq al-Marrakushi (d. 642 AH), so no mention of it appeared in 'Bughyat al-Nuqqad al-Naqalah'. As for the critic Ibn Abd al-Malik al-Marrakushi, nothing of his works in the craft of Hadith reached us, so we do not know if he knew the book or not. What draws attention is that the book entered the sphere of scientific circulation in the Andalusian shore early; as the author's direct students introduced it there. However, the atrophy of actual benefit from the book did not cut off the right of its narration and attribution, and therefore, among these chains of transmission coming next, are what books of indexes revealed...",

He said: He says: I heard Sa'id bin al-Musayyib; regarding the objection to what he said.' End of his speech. I say: His saying: 'in his book', then his specification of the end of Abu Hafs's speech indicate that he owned the book. He explicitly quoted from the Book of History (4/345), but what he quoted from what preceded is located in Al-'Ilal, and there is no contradiction; for some narrators combined the two books under the name of History; and they were emboldened to do so by the ease of joining them together in a collection, due to the small size of both; which is a matter of great benefit to readers and scribes as is evident. \n3.

Most of the jurisprudential choices unique to the book are narrated from Yahya bin Sa'id al-Qattan, and the Muhaddithin generally did not pay attention to them, so their collections were devoid of them, and Al-Fallas's book remained an original and sole source for them.

And from these examples, we will limit the presentation to the following: 1 - 'And I heard Yahya say to Sahl bin Hassan: Stand up and go to Ibn Abi Adi, and ask him about the Hadith of Sa'id bin Abi Aruba, from Qatadah, from Abu Ayyub, from Amr al-Bikali {And We placed between them a barrier} [Al-Kahf: 52]. 2 - He said: And I heard Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi, and Ibn Abi Adi was mentioned, so he praised him well (1), and he looked into a book of his with me regarding Ja'far bin Maymun, and he saw in it: Abu Ma'shar told us, from Ibrahim.' So he rejected it until he returned it to Abu Umamah. He said: Reject it until you return it to Abu Umamah. 3 - He said: And I heard Mu'adh praising Ibn Abi Adi well, and he said: 'I have known him for forty years for virtue and Sunnah' (2). 4 - He said: I heard Yahya say: Abu al-Anbas told us, he said: Zadan told us, he said: Umar bin al-Khattab wanted to pray over a funeral procession, but he saw a woman, so he did not pray over it, and said: 'There is no prayer over a funeral procession when a woman is with it.' So I said to Yahya: But Al-Aftas narrated to us about this with around fifteen hadiths? So Yahya said: He used to say in them: 'Zadan said, Zadan said,' but in this one he said: 'Zadan told us (Haddathana)'; so I wrote it (3). 5 - He said: I heard Yahya say: Uqbah bin Abi al-Ayzar told us, he said: I asked Ibrahim: How much should a woman cut from her hair? He said: Like this; and he placed his finger on the second joint of the index finger. So I said to him: Abd al-Rahman told us, he said: Sufyan told us,",

So Yahya said: I have heard Uqbah say: I asked Sa'id bin Jubayr and he said: 'The women know best'; So I said to Yahya: 'Should I write it?' He said: 'Yes' (1). 6 - And from it is the following report; and it is extremely abbreviated contrary to the original in *Al-Du'afa* (2); and it is in *Al-Minhaj* in explaining the rites of the pilgrim, by the consultant jurist Abu Abd Allah Muhammad bin Ahmad bin al-Hajj (3) up to his saying: 'to establish the remembrance of Allah' the first one; and likewise it appeared in the margins of Ibn Shaqla (4). The report did not appear complete with this chain in other than this book. Al-Fallas (5) said: And I heard Yahya bin Sa'id say: Ubayd Allah bin Abi Ziyad told us, he said: Al-Qasim told us, from Aisha, she said: 'Indeed, circumambulation (Tawaf) of the House, the hastening (Sa'i) between Safa and Marwa, and the casting of pebbles (Jamarat) were made only to establish the remembrance of Allah.' And I heard Ibn Dawud narrating it from Ubayd Allah bin Abi Ziyad, from Al-Qasim, from Aisha, from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. So I said to him: Indeed, Yahya did not raise it [to the Prophet]. He said: Allah knows best how I took the Hadith! And it is raised (Marfu'). And I heard Abu Asim say: Ubayd Allah bin Abi Ziyad told us, he said: Al-Qasim told us, from Aisha, from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him; So I came to Yahya and mentioned that to him, and he said: I heard Ubayd Allah narrating it raised (Marfu'), but I fear it. And Abu Qutaiba told me, he said: Sufyan told us, from Ubayd Allah bin Abi Ziyad, from Al-Qasim, from Aisha with the like of it; and he did not raise it.

    "text": "Corrections of the Book: It appears that the reports of the book are authentic, and a group of them you will not find in other than it, so they are from its unique narrations. The majority of it is useful when presented against its likes and counterparts in correcting much of what has befallen them; among them is what is useful in restoring what happened to some reports regarding obliteration; such as the saying of Al-Fallas: 'I heard Yahya bin Sa'id say: The mother of Shu'bah died, so I, Sulaiman al-Taimi, and Ibn Awn went to console him; So Al-Taimi said: Abu Nadrah told us. So Ibn Awn said to him: We have seen Abu Nadrah. So Sulaiman said to him: So you saw him, so what? So Ibn Awn remained silent' (1). This is useful in restoring what fell from the report itself in the history of Ibn Abi Khaythama (2). Or in detailing some reports that were transmitted in a brief, squeezed manner; such as in the statement of Abu Hafs: 'I mentioned to Yahya bin Sa'id the Hadith of Muhammad bin Amr al-Ansari, so I said to him: Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi told us, he said: Muhammad bin Amr told us, from Al-Qasim, from Aisha regarding the Aqiqah. So he said: He is more firm than Abd al-Rahman bin al-Qasim, yet he did not approve of him' (3). For this is a detailing of what befell the report of brevity in Ibn Hibban's *Al-Majruhin* (4), and Abu Ahmad al-Hakim in *Al-Asami wa Al-Kuna* (5). And the reports of the book are useful in correcting the names of some narrators, or helping in identifying them in reality; and from this is that the saying of Amr: I heard Yahya say to Ubayd Allah: Where",

And in *Tahdhib al-Tahdhib* (3): 'to some of his companions' with ambiguity, and Ubayd Allah is Al-Qawariri; Al-Dhahabi identified him in *Al-Tarikh* (4) and *Al-Mizan* (5). And among the examples that distinguished between two narrators of the same class who are similar in name; is that it occurred in the speech of Al-Fallas: 'I heard Sufyan bin Ziyad say to Yahya regarding the Hadith of Sufyan, from Ash'ath bin Abi al-Sha'tha, from Zaid bin Muawiyah al-Absi, from Alqamah, from Abdullah: {Its seal is musk} [Al-Mutaffifin: 26] (6). And related to this Hadith is the occurrence of the name of one of its narrators according to the correct way in the author's work, which is 'Zaid bin Muawiyah', which alerted us to the misspelling attached to it to become 'Yazid', in the book of *Tafsir* from *Al-Jami* by Ibn Wahb (7), and *Sifat al-Jannah* by Ibn Abi al-Dunya (8), and *Al-Ba'th wa Al-Nushur* by Al-Bayhaqi (9); so that led to confusion between two narrators, both of whom are from the same class. And this passed unnoticed by some of the predecessors like Isma'il bin Ulayyah, so Yahya bin Ma'in said in his history (10): 'And Isma'il also narrated, from Isra'il, from Abu Ishaq, from Yazid bin Muawiyah, that Salman read to them while he had urinated. Yahya said: It is only from Abu Ishaq, from Zaid bin Muawiyah al-Absi. Yahya said: And Yazid bin Muawiyah is a Nakha'i, a companion of Abdullah. Yahya said: Isma'il said: By Allah, I do not differentiate between them.' And Al-Khatib distinguished between them in *Tali Talkhis al-Mutashabih* (11). And among the places that corrected the name of a narrator and his lineage that occurred misspelled; is the saying of Al-Fallas: 'And I have not seen anyone narrating from this Sheikh – meaning: Musa bin Dinar – except...",

    "text": "two men: Ibn Nadbah and Yusuf al-Samti. In Al-Du'afa' by Al-Uqayli from the Algerian copy (C), unlike all printed editions: 'Yusuf bin Musa'; this is undoubtedly an error; it is actually Yusuf bin Khalid. And in the editions of Al-Du'afa' (Al-Salafi and Al-Sarsawi): 'Al-Sha'bi', without the editors discussing it; all of this is misspelling (Tashif), and the correct citation is in Al-Kamil. The attribution of the narrator to 'Hasan al-Samt' (good conduct/appearance) is excellent and unblemished in Al-Du'afa' itself in copy (C); in it: 'Ahmad bin Umar narrated to us; he said: I heard Amr bin Ali say: Yusuf al-Samti is a liar (Kadhdhab)'; his phrase is not in this book of ours, and an indication confirming the attribution is Abu Dawud's saying in his answers: 'He used to pray for a long time.' Comparing what is in the original with some of its transmitters revealed errors in transmission, leading to naming narrators who do not exist except due to misspelling. From it is that the author's story about Yahya bin Sa'id saying: 'I and Awf went to visit Al-Salt bin Dinar, so Al-Salt mentioned Ali and spoke ill of him. So Awf said to him: What is wrong with you, O Abu Shu'ayb, may Allah not lift your fall!', was cited by Abu Ahmad al-Hakim in his Kuna (Kunyas), but strangely he mentioned it in two entries: the entry of Abu al-Hasan Musa bin Dinar al-Makki - and this is its correct place - and the entry of Abu al-Tayyib Musa bin Yasar al-Makki, and accordingly he established the narrator's father's name as 'Dinar' in the first, and 'Yasar' in the second. What mostly led him into this error is the misspelling of the name in one of the copies he relied on. There is no relation between these two narrators, for Abu al-Hasan Musa bin Dinar is a weak Makki. And Abu al-Tayyib Musa bin Yasar is a Marwazi who lived in Al-Mada'in, so he is not Makki, and moreover he is trustworthy; as in Talkhis al-Mutashabih regarding the drawing (Rasm);",

Ibn Hajar said in 'Al-Lisan': 'Musa bin Yasar, Abu al-Tayyib al-Makki. From Aisha bint Talha. Abu Ahmad al-Hakim said: He is not strong according to them.' End quote; if his source is the book Al-Asami wa al-Kuna alone, he has added a narrator who does not exist except due to misspelling. Similar to what passed is at the saying of the original author: 'I heard Yahya say: Abu Madinah al-Sadusi is Abdullah bin Hisn.' End quote. I say: The report is in Al-Tarikh al-Kabir; and in it 'Husayn'; diminutive. But Al-Fallas in two places in his history in addition to this place in his 'Ilal, cited it magnified (Hisn). Abu Hatim was unique in Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil, saying: 'It is said: Ubaydullah'. And he has no follower. Some of what is in Al-'Ilal rectifies what occurred with transmitters of omissions leading to merging distinct paragraphs and preventing their original meaning; an example is Al-Fallas's saying: 'I heard Yahya say: Fitr narrated to us, from Ata who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: \"Whoever among you is afflicted with a calamity, let him remember his calamity by me, for it is the greatest of calamities\"; so I said to Yahya: \"Did he say in it: Ata narrated to me\"? He said: And what use is it to say: \"Ata narrated to us\", when he did not hear! Yahya said: And I heard him say: \"Abu Khalid al-Walibi narrated to us [he said: Ali went out while the prayer was established... \"; then Waki' came to us and narrated to us saying: \"Fitr narrated to us, from Za'idah bin Nashit, from Abu Khalid al-Walibi\"].

    "text": "editions of Al-Du'afa' by Al-Uqayli contradicted this transmission by way of misspelling, distortion, and omission. The report should have ended at his saying: '\"Ata narrated to us\", when he did not hear!', then resume speaking about Fitr in a following report, which is our practice, but the editions merged two reports into one, and were excessive in omission, thus disturbing the meaning horrendously. We placed what was omitted from them and rectified by our book between brackets, so the comparison becomes valid, although I think the origin of the defect is in Al-Uqayli's book itself, for Al-Dhahabi followed him in it, and Allah knows best. The danger of the omitted part appears in that it changes the critical judgment or impugns its direction; for Yazid bin Harun's narration is a witness to Fitr's hearing (Sama') from Al-Walibi, and Waki's narration is a witness to refuting his hearing, and it is the intended one, and with its loss the disturbance occurs, and it has happened!. Sometimes quoting parts of the author's single speech on a critical issue without the rest corrupts the intended judgment; as happened with Al-Fallas's saying: 'Yahya used not to narrate to us from Al-Walid bin Jami', then shortly before his death, he took them from Ali al-Sa'igh and narrated them to me; and they were six hadiths.' Ibn Hibban in Al-Majruhin, and Al-Hakim in Al-Madkhal quoted from it: 'And Yahya used not to narrate from Al-Walid bin Jami''; and did not cite its remainder, so their restriction led to the opposite of the author's intent, and entailed not considering Yahya's return to narrating from him, even though this stance of his undoubtedly stems from a justified critical revision. Another example of this sort; Amr bin Bahr's saying: 'And I heard Bishr bin al-Mufaddal say: Khalid narrated to us, he said: I heard Ali bin al-Aqmar say: [I heard Abu al-Ahwas say: I heard Abdullah bin Mas'ud say]: \"Whoever does not catch the bowing, the prostration is not counted\".'",

And he added 'prostration' after his saying: 'Whoever does not catch the bowing'; which is redundant. With this omission, the clarification of a significant meaning weakens, which is the concatenation (Tasalsul) of the hadith with hearing (Sama') - except in one place; i.e., every narrator saying about the one he narrated from in it: 'I heard'. Among the analogues; Al-Sayrafi said: I heard a man from our companions say to Yahya: Do you memorize from Abd al-Malik bin Umayr, from Musa bin Talha, that Abdullah bought land from the lands of Al-Sawad and made me a witness to it? Yahya said: From whom? He said: Ibn Dawud narrated to us saying: From whom? He said: From Ishaq bin al-Sabbah. [He said: Be silent, woe to you! And I heard Abdullah bin Dawud say: I heard Ishaq bin al-Sabbah] - a man from the descendants of Al-Ash'ath bin Qays - narrating from Abd al-Malik bin Umayr, he said: Musa bin Talha bought land from the land of Al-Sawad, so he sent to Al-Qasim bin Abd al-Rahman to witness it but he refused, so Musa said: Then I testify against your father - meaning: Abdullah bin Mas'ud - that he bought land from the land of Al-Sawad, and made me a witness to it. I say: Al-Ramhurmuzi quoted these two reports, but what I placed between brackets fell from the original of his book, due to skipping of sight, so the first report merged with the second, and the context became confused, and the second line of speech became redundant; because it contains repetition, not to mention the disturbance of Yahya's denial, which is a significant critical judgment. Had the text remained intact, it would be known that the author's narration is a confirmation of his companion's narration who asked Yahya.

The comparison between the texts of our book and what was scattered in the folds of transmission sources revealed the presence of additions that corrupt the meaning; from it: Amr bin Ali said: 'And Yahya used to narrate from Al-Hasan bin Dhakwan; and I never heard Abd al-Rahman mention him in a hadith at all.' The report is in Al-Kamil also; but in it occurred: 'And Yahya used not to narrate from Al-Hasan...'; which leads to the opposite of the author's intent. Also of this type: Amrawayh said: 'I heard Yahya and Abd al-Rahman, both narrating from Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Aqil, and people differ about him.' I say: What is in Al-Majruhin is contrary to what is in the original; in it: 'Yahya and Abd al-Rahman used not to narrate from Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Aqil.' So its meaning differed by the disruptive insertion. Another example; Al-Fallas said: 'And they both - meaning: Yahya and Abd al-Rahman - used to narrate from Abu Hurrah.' I say: In Al-Kamil, is the negation of the two Sheikhs' narration from Wasil; which produces a contradiction in attribution to Al-Fallas, and it is an error from the transmitter from Ibn Adi, evidenced by its occurrence correctly in Al-Maqrizi's abridgment of Al-Kamil.",

    "text": "Among the transmitters are those who benefited from the book, but erred in identifying some narrators, so our presentation of the original was useful in clarifying it; from that is Abu Hafs's saying: 'And the man - meaning: Yahya bin Ma'in - also mentioned Yunus bin Abi Ishaq and spoke about him; so Abd al-Rahman said: There was no harm in him. He said: And both Yahya and Abd al-Rahman narrated to me from him. He said: Yahya heard from him. And Abd al-Rahman, from Sufyan from him.' I say: With this report, an error in transmission is known in Al-Uqayli's Du'afa', leading to reversing the case; for Abu Ja'far, when he needed to distribute the text between two places, was confused in attributing the second part, so instead of attributing the speech to Yahya bin Ma'in, who is intended above by 'the man' as I explicitly stated, he attributed it to Yahya bin Sa'id, and explicitly named him saying: 'Ibn Sa'id', although the rest of the speech refutes it effortlessly, for how can Al-Qattan speak [critically] about a narrator then narrate from him outside of discussion sessions? The fulfillment of the comment in the speech brought after, signals an intention of objection by Ibn Mahdi, and this rarely happens with him against Al-Qattan. Al-Uqayli's intended phrase: 'Amr bin Ali; he said: I heard Yahya bin Sa'id mention one day Yunus bin Abi Ishaq and speak about him; so Abd al-Rahman said: There was no harm in him; Abu Hafs says it...'. And the transmission ends with a slight difference in wording to the text's saying: 'from Sufyan from him'. Attached to this is Abu Hafs's saying: 'Yahya bin Sa'id narrated to us; he said: Hisham narrated to us, he said: Yahya bin Abi Kathir narrated to us, from Hafs bin Farafisah, he said: I heard Urwah bin al-Zubayr saying in his prostration: \"O Allah, forgive Al-Zubayr bin al-Awwam, and Asma' bint Abi Bakr\".'

    "text": "misspelling of 'Hafs' to 'Ja'far', and the editor insisted it is Ja'far al-Sadiq; and it is not correct... One of the strongest examples of mutual support between text correction and critical authentication (Takhrij), is at Al-Fallas's saying: 'Yahya narrated to us, he said: Abd al-Rahman bin Khudayr narrated to us, he said: Abu Najih narrated to me, he said: I heard Abu Hurayrah say: That the ears of the son of Adam be filled with molten lead, is better for him than to hear the call [to prayer] and then not answer.' I say: In the original manuscript of 'Al-'Ilal': 'Hudayn'; a misspelling that passed by the editors of Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah, so they wrote it with Sad and Nun, and it was also misspelled in his entry in Du'afa' Al-Uqayli to 'Hadir' - with Ha' - and under the letter its unpointed counterpart in small script as usual. Al-Khatib cut off the dispute of every disputant; when he transmitted this very text from Al-Fallas, in his book Talkhis al-Mutashabih fi al-Rasm; but he prefaced it by saying: 'As for the second with Kha' and Dad with dots and with Ra', he is: Abd al-Rahman bin Khudayr al-Hana'i al-Basri'; then he cited the report. Before him, Al-Askari in Tashifat al-Muhaddithin pointed out the occurrence of misspelling for this name. Among what relates to clear misspelling that changes the realities of narrators, is what you find in Al-'Ilal from Amr: 'And I heard Yahya say: I was born in the year one hundred and twenty at its beginning, and Mu'adh was born in the year nineteen at its end; he was older than me by two months.' For the report is in Al-Kamil also but with a heinous misspelling that corrupted the meaning; in it: 'And Khalid was born in the year twenty at its beginning.' So his saying: 'Khalid', is a misspelling, the correct is 'Yahya'; for he is the intended one.",

    "text": "Attached to what passed, is what Ibn Adi quoted in Al-Kamil from our book, which is Al-Fallas's saying: 'I heard a man narrating to Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi from Yahya bin Sa'id, from Ubaydullah, from Nafi', that Ibn Umar used to return [greeting] just as he was greeted...'. The transmission in Zakkar's edition suffered from the omission of 'Ubaydullah' between Yahya and Nafi', and in it and Al-Sarsawi's edition the misspelling of 'kama' (just as) to 'kullama' (whenever); and there is a difference between them. Among what Al-Sayrafi's words alerted to is the existence of fabrication by some transmitters from him between two biographies and attributing what concerns one to the other; what he said in the entry of Muhammad bin Abi al-Ja'd: 'And I never heard Abd al-Rahman mention this Sheikh', and he is the one meant by him as 'the Sheikh'. Ibn Asakir transmitted this phrase textually, in the biography of Sulayman bin Arqam, although the speech is about someone else; and the dominant thought is that the transmission is an error; because the speech in the copy of Al-'Ilal about Sulayman bin Arqam comes immediately after the speech about Ibn Abi al-Ja'd, and that is a cause for confusion and ambiguity, and the origin of it as it appears is from someone above Ibn Asakir. Mughlatay fell into the same confusion in his Ikmal; and this was also attributed to Ibn Hajar in Tahdhib al-Tahdhib. Al-Uqayli quoted correctly from the author in the entry of Muhammad bin Abi al-Ja'd, so he did not mix him up with Sulayman bin Arqam. Related to what passed, is that what is in Al-Tarikh al-Kabir by Al-Bukhari is problematic if authentic; for it contains Ibn Mahdi's mention of the narrator, contrary to Abu Hafs's statement; which contradicts everyone's transmission; and its text is: 'Muhammad bin Abi al-Ja'd: He heard Al-Sha'bi. His saying; Ibn Mahdi said it from Sufyan', and in the phrase as you see is anxiety we did not feel comfortable with, especially with the absence of this detail in the books of transmitters benefiting from Al-Bukhari, especially Al-Jarh...",

Perhaps the correct speech is: 'His saying; Yahya said it from Sufyan'; so 'Ibn Mahdi' would be a misspelling of 'Yahya al-Qattan'; which is supported by Al-Fallas's saying: 'And I heard Yahya say: Sufyan narrated to us, he said: Muhammad bin Abi al-Ja'd narrated to me, from Al-Sha'bi, that he disliked buying goldsmith's dust', but it remains possible that it is narrated from Ibn Mahdi as well, so it enters the realm of possibility, and Allah knows best. Among what the book revealed of the combination of omission, misspelling, and insertion in a single report transmitted from him, is Al-Fallas's saying: 'And Yahya narrated to us, from Bakr bin Khunays; and he is weak. He said: I heard Yahya; he said: Shu'bah narrated from Abu al-Sabah, and he is Sulayman bin Yasir; and he is weak, he narrated from Hammam bin al-Harith rejected (Munkar) hadiths; among them: from Ibrahim, and from Hammam bin al-Harith, regarding reading in the bathhouse.. and I do not memorize anything from Sufyan from him.' I say: What occurred in Al-Kamil: 'And Yahya narrated to us from Bakr bin Khunays, and he is weak, he narrated from Hammam bin al-Harith rejected hadiths, and I do not memorize anything from Sufyan from him': is a fabrication between two statements about two narrators, its beginning is for Bakr bin Khunays, and its remainder is for Sulayman bin Yasir; as appears by comparison with the text above; and it is an illusion resulting from an omission in the author's original, evidenced by its occurrence in Al-Maqrizi's abridgment as well. What supports what we said, is that Ibn Adi returned and quoted Al-Fallas's saying in another place: 'Ibn Dawud used to say: Sulayman bin Yasir, from Hammam bin al-Harith, and Ibrahim, from Abdullah: Disliked reading in the bathhouse.'",

Harb bin Isma'il: And [Ahmad] mentioned Al-Salt bin Dinar so he seemed to weaken him (His Masa'il: 3/1307; no. 2301). Al-Bukhari: Shu'bah used to speak against him (Al-Tarikh al-Awsat: 3/571; no. 867). Ya'qub bin Shaybah said in his Musnad (56; no. 60-61): 'Shu'bah said: Do not take from Sufyan al-Thawri except from a man you know; for he does not care from whom he carries hadith'. This is elaborated in Al-Uqayli's narration (His Du'afa': 3/122; no. 2641): 'For he narrates to you from the likes of Abu Shu'ayb the Madman: Al-Salt bin Dinar'. Abu Zur'ah: Basran, soft (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 4/438; no. 1919). Abu Dawud said in his answers (1/368; no. 672; 1/420; no. 857): Weak. Al-Fasawi: Weak, his hadith is nothing (Al-Ma'rifah wa al-Tarikh: 2/123). Al-Nasa'i: Not trustworthy (Al-Du'afa' wa al-Matrukun: 195; no. 303). Ibn Shaqla said in his Turar (135; no. 160): Al-Salt bin Dinar, Abu Shu'ayb al-Hana'i al-Majnun al-Ta'i, abandoned in hadith. Al-Daraqutni: Basran, abandoned (His Du'afa': 250; no. 296). Ibn Shahin: Basran, he is nothing (Tarikh Asma' al-Du'afa' wa al-Kadhdhabin: 109; no. 293). The cause of his weakness is the bouts of madness that used to afflict him, until the nickname 'The Madman' stuck to him, so perhaps his hadith became confused because of that. Abu Hatim said: 'He is soft in hadith, bordering on weakness, confused in hadith, his hadith is written' (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 4/438, no. 1919). As if he was criticized for memory, hence he said: 'His hadith is written'. But the last straw is Nasb (hatred of Ali): Al-Saji mentioned him among the weak and said: Awf [i.e., Ibn Abi Jamilah] said: He used to belittle Ali bin Abi Talib (Ikmal Tahdhib al-Kamal: 6/392; no. 2522). Ibn Hibban said: 'He was among those who insult the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and hate Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, and speak ill of him and his household, in addition to the abundance of rejected narrations in his transmission' (Al-Majruhin: 1/375; and Al-Sam'ani quoted it from him in his Ansab without attribution: 13/431). \n1.

His narration with its wording, for valid comparison, is: 'Amr bin Ali said: I heard Yahya bin Sa'id say: Al-Taimi came one day to Ibn Awn, and Al-Taimi said: Abu Nadrah told us. Ibn Awn said: I have seen Abu Nadrah. Al-Taimi said to him: If you have seen Abu Nadrah, then so what? So Ibn Awn remained silent.' Al-Fallas was followed in a similar manner by Ahmad in *Al-Du'afa* by Al-Uqayli (6/33; No: 5850-5851), and Ibrahim bin Ar'arah in *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir* by Ibn Abi Khaythama (Second Volume: 1/493; No: 2023). The story has another outlet with different wording via Ali bin Al-Madini from his father from Shu'bah, in *Su'alat Muhammad bin Uthman bin Abi Shaybah li-Ibn Al-Madini* (84-85; Ms: 77), and it is also in *Al-Ma'rifah wa Al-Tarikh* (3/11-12), suspended from Yahya, with Shu'bah being the narrator. What falls under Al-Fallas is useful in restoring what befell the report in the history of Ibn Abi Khaythama: Third Volume: 3/217-218; No: 4541. See: *Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 4/199; No: 1779; *Al-Ilal wa Ma'rifat Al-Rijal*: 2/27; No: 1444; 3/217; No: 4939; *Ma'rifat Al-Thiqat* by Al-Ajli: 2/298; No: 1790. \n2. He is Ibn Tarkhan Abu Al-Mu'tamir. He used to reside among Banu Taim, and he is a client (Mawla) of Banu Murrah. Ibn Abi Hatim said this in *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil* (4/124; No: 539). His mention by the author will be repeated later. It is no surprise that he met with Ibn Awn, as he was regarded with him for various inclusions, until Abu Hatim said: 'Abdullah bin Awn is trustworthy (Thiqah), and he is older than Sulaiman Al-Taimi' (*Al-Jarh*: 5/131; No: 605). \n3. Abdullah bin Awn bin Artaban, Abu Awn. \n4. His name: Al-Mundhir bin Malik Al-Abdi, died in the year one hundred and nine, as stated by Al-Fallas in *Al-Tarikh* (287, 337).

Al-Dawlabi reported it in his *Kuna* (3/1088) from Yahya bin Sa'id, saying: 'I heard Yahya bin Ma'in say: Abu Nadrah is Al-Mundhir bin Malik bin Qi'ah; this is what Yahya said; he did not say: Ibn Qati'ah.' Likewise, it appeared in his history from the narration of Al-Duri (4/141; No: 3597), *Ilal Ahmad* (3/224; No: 4976), *Su'alat Abi Dawud* (191; No: 110), and others. Abu Ali Al-Ghassani said in *Taqyid Al-Muhmal* (1/109): 'With a Kasra on the Qaf and a Sukun on the Ta', and Al-Khazraji recorded it similarly in *Al-Khulasah* (387), and I do not know their source for it. Yahya bin Ma'in was asked about him and said: Trustworthy (*Al-Kamil*: 9/591; No: 16200), and likewise he said in the narration of Ishaq bin Mansur from him (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 8/241; No: 1088). Abu Zur'ah: Trustworthy (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 8/241; No: 1088). Abu Hatim: I know nothing but good (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 8/241; No: 1088). Al-Uqayli did not bring anything in his biography in *Al-Du'afa* more than the report above, but with differing outlets. Ibn Adi said: If a trustworthy person narrates from him, his hadith is straight, and I have not seen any objectionable (Munkar) hadiths from him; because I did not find any objectionable hadith when a trustworthy person narrates from him, therefore I did not mention anything for him (*Al-Kamil*: 9/591). I say: It is as if he deemed him acceptable with this. \n1. Among the benefits of the report - which is the primary intent - is that Ibn Awn did not find a way before these knowledgeable critics to disparage Abu Nadrah as was his habit - if it is established that the following story is a different incident than the one mentioned by Al-Fallas above; for in *Al-Kamil* by Ibn Adi (9/590; No: 16197): 'Yahya bin Zakariya bin Abi Za'idah said: Abu Nadrah was mentioned to Ibn Awn. He said: We have seen Abu Nadrah!'. Abu Dawud said (2/40; No: 1046): 'Ibn Awn signaled a defect in him (Ghamazahu).' This is the implication of the story. If Ibn Awn's statement had any weight, these Imams would have acknowledged it, but since they did not, it became apparent that he criticized him without proof. Furthermore, Al-Taimi is not rejected regarding Abu Nadrah, for he heard from him, and that is why Ibn Awn could not give an answer. Even if he saw him, he cannot say like Al-Taimi 'He told us (Haddathana)', as he has no hearing from him, let alone impugn him, and Allah knows best. A parallel to this is that Abu Hatim said: A group in Basra saw Anas bin Malik but did not hear from him; among them is Ibn Awn (*Marasil Ibnihi*: 113; No: 412).",

He said: I heard Mu'adh say: I said to Auf: Indeed, Amr bin Ubaid narrated to us from Al-Hasan, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: 'Whoever bears arms against us is not one of us.' He said: Amr lied, by Allah! But he wanted to divert it to his malicious doctrine (*Al-Kamil*: 7/522; No: 12019; *Tarikh Baghdad*: 14/81). He said: I heard Mu'adh bin Mu'adh, and he mentioned the story of Amr bin Ubaid: If {Perish the hands of Abu Lahab} was in the Preserved Tablet, then there is no blame on Abu Lahab (*Al-Qadar* by Al-Faryabi: 1/186; No: 290; *Al-Shari'ah* by Al-Ajurri: 2/915; No: 510; *Al-Ibanah Al-Kubra* by Ibn Battah: 4/305; No: 1977; *Tarikh Baghdad*: 14/70).

As for what he did not declare hearing in, it is probable that he practiced Tadlis (obfuscation) regarding them, and dropped Laith bin Abi Sulaim or Abu Yahya Al-Qattat or Hakim bin Jubair between him and Mujahid; those who are weak.

He said: None of them are established except what he said: 'I heard'; they are around ten. Indeed, his hadiths from Mujahid are from Abu Yahya Al-Qattat, and Hakim bin Jubair, and these (*Ikmal Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 6/92; 2227: and Ibn Hajar quoted it in *Tahdhib Al-Tahdhib* briefly: 4/225).

Waki' said: Al-A'mash did not hear from Mujahid except four hadiths (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 1/224). I say: Their disagreement on the number of hadiths is due to the variation in their capabilities in the breadth of narration, the induction of chains, and the intent to track; for whoever mentioned four or five, mostly intended what occurred in his memory at the moment, unlike one who took the path of investigation and exhaustion like the affair of Muhammad bin Isma'il (Al-Bukhari), for he mentioned more than before.

It appears as if Al-Daraqutni in *Al-Ilal* (8/289; No: 1576) benefited in this place from this book of ours; as shown by comparing them. \n3. The Hadith is weak from this aspect due to the weakness of the narrator from Makhul as determined by Yahya Al-Qattan, and Makhul's lack of hearing from Abu Hurairah; for Al-Ajurri asked Abu Dawud (2/194; No: 1577): 'How many of the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, are valid for Makhul? He said: Wathilah. He said: And it was said to Abu Mushir? He said: Anas. It was said: So Wathilah? He said: I do not know.' I say: It appears from this that Makhul from Abu Hurairah is Mursal (disconnected); and Al-Daraqutni asserted this. Al-Fallas was followed by Uthman bin Abi Shaybah in *Al-Ibanah Al-Kubra* by Ibn Battah (4/100; No: 1515); and from his path Al-Faryabi in *Al-Qadar* (163); No: (232). The wording of the follow-up is: 'Indeed for every Ummah there are Magians, and the Magians of this Ummah are the Qadariyyah'; and in it is the addition: 'If they fall sick do not visit them, and if they die do not attend their funerals.' The summary of speech on the Hadith is that it is objectionable (Munkar), and its paths are severely weak. \n4. *Al-Du'afa*: 4/1268; No: 1272; *Al-Kamil*: 9/288; No: 15348; Abu Ahmad Al-Hakim abbreviated the transfer in *Al-Asami wa Al-Kuna* (The Manuscript Section F 195 A); so this amount of text did not appear with him: So I said to him: Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi told us, he said: Muhammad bin Amr told us, from Al-Qasim, from Aisha regarding the Aqiqah; so he said. Ibn Hibban abbreviated Al-Fallas's speech in *Al-Majruhin* (2/286), and limited it to his saying: 'I mentioned to Yahya bin Sa'id =",

It turns out that among his objectionable reports (Manakir) from Al-Qasim, from Aisha, are at least three hadiths: Regarding Aqiqah as the author mentioned, and regarding the horned ram as passed previously by Ibn Al-Madini - and I fear these two are one, for how close is the horned ram to the Aqiqah - and regarding the Middle Prayer. About this, Ibn Abd al-Barr said in *Al-Tamhid* (4/289): As for the hadith of Aisha, Waki' narrated it from Muhammad bin Amr, from Al-Qasim bin Muhammad, from Aisha, she said: It is the Asr prayer. Isma'il also narrated that from Muhammad bin Abi Bakr, from Ibn Mahdi, from Muhammad bin Amr, from Al-Qasim, from Aisha. I say: Waki's narration is in *Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah* (5/517; No: 8695). He has another narration regarding Aqiqah other than what was mentioned, a report narrated by Al-Fallas, he said: Abu Qutaiba informed me, he said: Muhammad bin Amr Abu Sahl Al-Ansari told us, he said: I heard Muhammad bin Sirin say: I performed Aqiqah for myself with a she-camel after I became a man (*Al-Kuna wa Al-Asma* by Al-Dawlabi: 4/94; No: 802). \n3. *Al-Isti'ab*: 4/1757; No: 3173. \n4.

Mughlatay added: 'It is said: The man from whom Malik narrated the Hadith: \"I hunted a Nahas\" in the Book of Hajj, is Shurahbil bin Sa'd, and he is weakened, and Malik only omitted his name for that reason.'

I say: Meaning: when he is solitary, and that is why Al-Bukhari did not extract for him in his *Sahih*, but extracted for him in *Al-Adab Al-Mufrad* supported by others. And in the speech of Ali bin Al-Madini appeared an explanation of why he was weakened: 'There was no one in Medina more knowledgeable about Maghazi (campaigns) than him, so he fell into need; so it was as if they accused him!' (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 1/37; and with its meaning in *Tarikh Ibn Abi Khaythama*: Volume Three: 2/227; No: 2595). Its interpretation from Ali's wording also: 'They used to fear that if he came to a man and asked him for something and he didn't give him, he would say about him: His father did not witness Badr' (*Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 2/187; No: 713). End quote. Ali did not confirm this wound definitively as you see, but it is within the realm of possibility. For ultimately, the confusion of senility and the necessity of poverty combined for him. In my opinion, the accusation by Ibn Dhi'b and others is directed towards this, as his hearing is old. If he had been branded with lying at first, his narration would not have lasted long. It appears that if what was heard from him early on could be separated from what came later, the first would be accepted and the second rejected. But since that was difficult - along with the accusation whether true or not - Al-Barqi listed him in the chapter of those whose hadith is predominantly weak, and some scholars of Hadith abandoned narrating from him as in *Ikmal Ibn Qulayj* (6/228). So the most correct view regarding his hadith is confusion (Ikhtilat). \n1. This report is supported by a similar one from Ali bin Al-Madini, who said: Yahya told us, saying: Muhammad bin Ishaq was asked about Shurahbil bin Sa'd, so he said: We do not narrate anything from him (*Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir* by Ibn Abi Khaythama: Volume Three: 2/228; No: 2597; *Al-Du'afa* by Al-Uqayli: C: Folio 142 A; and the wording is his). \n2. I say: The place of Al-Qattan's speech is not the modification (Ta'dil) of Shurahbil nor does it benefit him in any way. Rather, it is a disapproval that",

It also implies that Ibn Ishaq is accused in his speech about Shurahbil, for they both tread the same path: Sira and Maghazi, so it is like the wounding of peers. The utmost that the report benefits, Allah willing, is that Yahya has a bad opinion of Ibn Ishaq, and that his opinion of Shurahbil is better in condition, if the former is compared to the latter.

In it is the meaning that he accepts prompting (Talqin). _________ = Al-Muthanna said: So I mentioned that to Abu Al-Walid, and he said: I mentioned to Yahya bin Sa'id, and he said something similar to what he said to you (*Du'afa Al-Uqayli* - with a fuller context -: 6/96; No: 5985; *Al-Kamil*: 10/16; No: 16557; and the wording is his). \n1. Amr bin Ali said in *Al-Tarikh* (399): 'Mujalid bin Sa'id Al-Hamdani died in the year one hundred and forty-four, in Dhul-Hijjah.' The earliest to speak about Mujalid was Shu'bah bin Al-Hajjaj, and he found in him what necessitates his weakness; from Asim bin Ali, he said: My brother Al-Hasan told me, saying: Shu'bah said to me: O Hasan, I seek Allah's guidance, and I will destroy Mujalid (*Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 6/95; No: 5983). I say: Meaning: I will ruin him; he intends the consequence, which is striking out his hadith and abandoning narration from him. Ibn Sa'd said: He was weak in Hadith (*Al-Tabaqat Al-Kabir*: 8/468; No: 3378). Then followed Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Qattan from Shu'bah's students, and it is gathered from the transfer of his students from him that he used to approve of Mujalid then turned away from him, or the opposite - and we do not determine which is earlier or later - and sometimes he appears in some transfers as hesitant; but his weakening of him is more famous and common. As for the proofs of all that from him, they are many; from the first is that Ibn Al-Muthanna Al-Anzi said: 'I heard Yahya bin Sa'id narrating from Mujalid (*Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 6/96; 5986; *Al-Kamil*: 10/14; No: 16551). From the second, which is reasoned, is Yahya's saying: 'Mujalid does not separate the saying of Masruq from the saying of Alqamah.' (*Al-Kamil*: 10/14; No: 16550). From the third is the saying of Ali bin Al-Madini: I said to Yahya bin Sa'id: What about Mujalid? He said: In my soul (mind) there is something about him! (*Al-Kamil*: 10/14; No: 16549). Yahya bin Ma'in almost joins Yahya bin Sa'id, for they resembled each other in their stance on our companion, until Ibn Abi Khaythama said: I heard Yahya bin Ma'in say: Mujalid bin Sa'id is trustworthy. And I heard him another time say: Mujalid bin Sa'id is weak, flimsy in Hadith' (*The Third Volume: Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir*: 3/117; No: 4065), as if they were riding the same mount. As for Al-Qattan's speech on him, it would not have occurred if his trustworthiness had been verified by him, and it is speech evidenced by his saying: 'Mujalid used to be prompted in Hadith if prompted' (*Ma'rifat Al-Thiqat*: 2/264; No: 1685), Al-Ajli added: 'And he saw him and heard from him - meaning: Yahya -'; which is an alert from him that it is a valid reasoning from a critic who witnessed and probed.

I say: And he spoke the truth; for the disagreement reported from the two Sheikhs regarding Mujalid did not occur regarding Ash'ath, for they both abandoned narrating from him as a single opinion as Al-Fallas recounted in this book of ours, and added: 'And I saw Abd al-Rahman strike out his hadith.' Abu Hatim was asked about Mujalid bin Sa'id, can his hadith be used as proof? He said: 'No, and he is more beloved to me than Bishr bin Harb, Abu Harun Al-Abdi, and Shahr bin Hawshab, and more beloved to me than Dawud Al-Awdi, and Isa Al-Hannat, and Mujalid is not strong in Hadith' (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 8/362; No: 1653). In the book *Al-Du'afa* by Ibn Al-Jarud: 'Mujalid, Laith, and Hajjaj are equal, they are not used as proof' (*Ikmal Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 11/71; No: 4423). I say: Comparing him to these is close, for all of them shared at least one formal inclusion, which is Yahya's abstention from narrating from them, and Abd al-Rahman's narration from a narrator from them (See: Our book in the drawing of Laith bin Abi Sulaim, and Hajjaj bin Artah), furthermore, Mujalid and Laith are among those accused of confusion (Ikhtilat) and poor memory; Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi said: 'The hadith of Mujalid with the younger ones like Yahya bin Sa'id and Abu Usamah is nothing, but the hadith of Shu'bah, Hammad bin Zaid, Hushaim and these old ones', Ibn Abi Hatim said: 'Meaning: that his memory changed at the end of his life' (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 8/361; No: 1653). Al-Tirmidhi said: 'Likewise, those of the people of knowledge who spoke about Mujalid bin Sa'id, Abd al-Rahman bin Lahia'ah and others, only spoke about them due to their memory and abundance of error, and more than one of the Imams have narrated from them. So if one of these is solitary with a hadith and is not followed up on it, it is not used as proof' (*Ilaluhu*: 6/242; in the tail of *Al-Sunan*). =",

    "foot_note": "1. [1] *Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 'Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Qattan'; *Al-Siyar*: 'Yahya bin Sa'id'. [2] (Saad): 'Ata'. _________ = Ibn Shahin held the view: That this disagreement regarding Mujalid necessitates pausing on him, and he is closer to modification (Ta'dil); because the one who weakened him chose him, and the one who dispraised him praised him; because Yahya bin Sa'id weakened him in raising the hadith then chose him over Hajjaj and Laith, and Yahya bin Ma'in documented him (declared him Thiqah) after he had weakened him, and Allah knows best (*Dhikr man Ikhtalafa Al-Ulama wa Nuqqad Al-Hadith Fihi*: 93; No: 48). \n1. *Al-Du'afa*: (Ms: 317 Z; Print: 1150/3 - 1151; No: 1524); *Siyar A'lam Al-Nubala*: 32/7; No: 14. \n2. Aside from his Shi'ism, no one brought a clear wound against Fitr, except what came from Yahya Al-Qattan, for he was of the view that Fitr narrates from Ata but did not hear from him; and the benefit of the report above is that Fitr used to insert a man or two between him and some narrators, and Yahya decided that this was a habit of his; Ali bin Al-Madini asked him about that and said: 'So do you rely on his saying: So-and-so told us, he said: So-and-so told us? He said: No' (*Al-Du'afa* by Al-Uqayli: C: 317 A). But Yahya is obstinate/strict in criticizing men - in Al-Dhahabi's expression - as is famous, rather Ibn Al-Madini attributed strictness to him, saying: 'If Yahya bin Sa'id and Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi agree on abandoning a man I do not narrate from him, and if they disagree I take the saying of Abd al-Rahman because he is the more moderate of the two, and there was strictness in Yahya' (*Tahdhib Al-Tahdhib*: 6/280). Al-Bukhari applied moderation so he did not follow his Sheikh Yahya in his opinion entirely, so he extracted for Fitr coupled with others in one hadith (*Sahihuhu*: 8/6; No: 5991). It appears from Al-Daraqutni's saying about Fitr in his answers to Al-Hakim (264; No: 454): 'Deviant, not used as proof; that he linked the ruling to his defect which is extremism in the doctrine (Madhhab); and he has a precedent in this action, which is the saying of Abu Bakr bin Ayyash: 'I did not abandon narrating from Fitr, except for the badness of his doctrine' (*Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 5/109; No: 4950), and close to it is the saying of Imam Ahmad: 'Fitr was trustworthy according to Yahya, but he was an excessive Khashabi (Shi'a)' (*Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 5/109; No: 4951), so it is apparent that whoever turned away from him did so for what passed; so he was not severely weak then, rather he is closer to trustworthiness, which is the implication of the sayings of many of the modifiers (Mu'addilin), see them in: *Tahdhib Al-Kamal* (314 - 315/23; No: 4773). And the saying of Abu Dawud in his answers to Abu Ubaid Al-Ajurri (1/192; No: 152): 'I heard Ahmad bin Abdullah bin Yunus say: We used to pass by Fitr while he was cast aside, we did not write from him'. End quote; it is a description of the reality, and it does not necessitate disparagement from the turning away of those people, for they only =",

[5] In Al-Du'afa' and Al-Siyar: 'And he did not hear from him'. [6] The report should end here, then resume speaking about Fitr in a following report, which is our practice, and all editions of Al-Du'afa' contradicted it by way of misspelling, distortion, and omission (among them: Al-Salafi ed.: 3/1150-1151; Al-Sarsawi ed.: 5/110-111), merging two reports into one, and adding to the omission, thus disturbing the meaning horrendously. We placed what was omitted from them and rectified by our book between parentheses, so the comparison becomes valid, although I think the origin of the defect is in Al-Uqayli's book itself, for Al-Dhahabi followed him in it, and Allah knows best. The danger of the omitted part appears in that it changes the critical judgment or impugns its direction; for Yazid bin Harun's narration is a witness to Fitr Al-Walibi's hearing, and Waki's narration is a witness to refuting his hearing, and it is the intended one, and with its loss the disturbance occurs, and it has happened.

[9] What is between parentheses fell from Al-Uqayli's book. _________ = they discarded him because they found someone better than him, for the arena of Hadith was full of greats, and the sweet source is crowded as they say. \n1. Waki's narration with its chain and text is extracted from him by Ibn Abi Shaybah in Al-Musannaf: 3/359; no. 4117, and Al-Fadl bin Dukayn in Fada'il Al-Salah: no. 257. \n2. The hadith via Ali is also in Al-Uqayli's book; and in its printed version (5/111; no. 4957) 'Za'idah bin Nashit' was misspelled to 'Za'idah, and Ibn Nashit'; so the narrator turned into two narrators, and this error was transmitted from Al-Uqayli by later scholars.",

In the reason for linking this report to the one before it is a point; which is that Fitr was compared to Al-Ajlah; Abdullah bin Ahmad said: 'I heard my father say: How close Al-Ajlah is to Fitr bin Khalifah' (Al-'Ilal wa Ma'rifat al-Rijal: 2/413; no. 2849). And add to it that both are Shi'a. This is from aspects of mental association in Al-Fallas's mind during composition, which is rich with analogous and similar narrators. However, gathering the statements of Imams regarding both - even if they are close - shows that Fitr's condition is better than his peer's condition, and Allah knows best. \n2. He is: Ajlah bin Abdullah Al-Kindi, and Ibn Zanjuyah named him 'Yahya', as in his Tabaqat al-Fuqaha' wa al-Muhaddithin (manuscript): (78). And Ajlah is his nickname. Al-Fallas said in his History (400): 'He died in the year one hundred and forty-five'. Ibn Sa'd: He was very weak (Al-Tabaqat al-Kabir: 8/469; no. 3380). Ibn Ma'in said about him in Al-Duri's narration (3/269; no. 1276): Trustworthy. And said once: There is no harm in him (3/454; no. 2232). And said also in the narrations of Al-Kawsaj (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 2/347; no. 1317) and Al-Daqqaq (42; no. 52): 'Salih' (Good/Righteous). Ibn Shahin recounted from him (Tarikh Asma' al-Du'afa': 118; no. 333) via Al-Kawsaj contrary to the above, saying: 'Weak'; and I consider it an illusion from him in transmission. He attributed similar via Al-Mufaddal. Ibn al-Madini: I said to Yahya bin Sa'id: Ajlah? He said: There is something in my heart about him (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 2/347; no. 1317). Abu Hatim: Al-Ajlah is soft, not strong, his hadith is written but not used as proof (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 2/347; no. 1317). Abu Dawud via Al-Ajurri (1/318; no. 531): 'Ajlah is weak'. And added: And Yahya has narrated from Ajlah'. Al-Fasawi: Kufan trustworthy, in his hadith there is softness (Al-Ma'rifah wa al-Tarikh: 3/104). Al-Saji: Weak, and he is truthful (Ikmal Tahdhib al-Kamal: 2/14; no. 239). And in Ibn al-Jarud's book: He is nothing (Ikmal Tahdhib al-Kamal: 2/14; no. 239). Abu al-Qasim al-Balkhi and Abu al-Arab mentioned him among the weak (Ikmal Tahdhib al-Kamal: 2/14; no. 239). Abu Abd Allah al-Hakim mentioned him in Ma'rifat Jama'ah min =",

    "foot_note": "1. [1] Not in Al-Du'afa' nor in Al-Majruhin nor in Al-Kamil, and the context of the report with the first two is more correct than in our copy. [2] In the original: 'And I heard Yahya say', and it contains a corrupting insertion. The meaning in reality is that Yahya heard Al-Ajlah say ... the report. In Al-Kamil: 'I thought he said'; and I think it is a misspelling. Accordingly, 'He said' occurring above belongs to Yahya not Al-Fallas, and whoever joined the two paragraphs without pause did well, as Al-Uqayli did. _________ = the Narrators of the Successors and those after them whose hadith was not used as proof in the Sahih and were not dropped' (Ma'rifat 'Ulum al-Hadith: 337). I say: It is synonymous with the words of Al-Fasawi and Al-Saji; and it is one of the most just opinions. No one was excessive in disparaging him as Al-Juzjani did - and he is obstinate in disparagement - for he said: 'Fabricator (Muftarin)' (Ahwal al-Rijal: 59), and no critic denied his truthfulness, so perhaps it is a terminology of Abu Ishaq al-Sa'di whose significance we did not grasp, and Allah knows best. Sufyan bin Uyaynah considered him having better memory than Muhammad bin Salim (Al-Kamil: 9/136; no. 14835). And [Ibn Ma'in] prioritized him over Mujalid and Hajjaj bin Arta'ah and Ibn Abi Layla (Al-Takmil by Ibn Kathir: 2/23). Al-Qattan reversed the case regarding Mujalid specifically, for Ali bin Abdullah said: I said to Yahya bin Sa'id: Where was Al-Ajlah compared to Mujalid? He said: He was below him (Al-Du'afa' by Al-Uqayli: 1/356; no. 566). In Al-Kamil (2/367; no. 2721): 'Worse condition than him'. Ali Ibn al-Madini said from Yahya bin Sa'id al-Qattan: Mu'arrif bin Wasil is more established than Al-Ajlah (Tahdhib al-Kamal: 28/261; no. 6084). Ahmad bin Hanbal: Ajlah and Mujalid are close in hadith; Ajlah has narrated more than one rejected hadith (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 2/347; no. 1317). In Su'alat Abi Dawud to Ahmad (316-317; no. 426): I said to Ahmad: Is Ajlah more beloved to you or Hurayth? He said: Ajlah. I said: Do you narrate from him? He said: Yes'. Al-Uqayli: 'And Al-Ajlah is not followed on this despite his confusion in it, except by one who is below him: Muhammad bin Salim' (Al-Du'afa' by Al-Uqayli: 1/357; no. 572). Ibn Adi: 'Al-Ajlah bin Abdullah has good hadiths ... The Kufans and others narrate from him, and I did not find anything rejected from him exceeding the limit neither in Isnad nor text, and I hope there is no harm in him, except that he is counted among the Shi'a of Kufa, and he is, in my view, straight in hadith, truthful (Al-Kamil: 2/373; no. 2737). \n1.

Meaning: He inverted the name, and it should be Ali bin Al-Husayn. \n2. The defect in it is from Ajlah; because Habib bin Abi Thabit is trustworthy, all good is not denied from him; - as Ahmad said in his Answers (299; no. 363) - and it was narrated from him correctly - i.e., from Ali bin Husayn, Sa'id bin Mansur extracted it in his Sunan (1/292; no. 1033), saying: Hammad bin Shu'ayb narrated to us, from Habib bin Abi Thabit with it with a fuller context, and Hammad is weak. Indeed, the hadith is also straight from Al-Ajlah, narrated by Sa'id bin Mansur in his Sunan (1/292; no. 1034) from Hushaym, Al-Ajlah informed us, from Habib, he said: A man came to Ali bin Husayn, and said: What do you say about a man who said: 'If' I marry so-and-so she is divorced?? He said: 'It is nothing, Allah began with marriage before divorce, then He said: {O you who have believed, when you marry believing women and then divorce them} [Al-Ahzab: 49], so Allah began with marriage before divorce, and his saying is nothing.' Hushaym bin Bashir Al-Wasiti is trustworthy with much memorization but practices Tadlis (See: Ikmal Mughlatay: 12/156-161; no. 4960), but he declared hearing, and it is not thought of him to hear an illusion from Al-Ajlah and correct it, so it remains only that Al-Ajlah narrated the hadith well when Hushaym heard it from him, then poor memory or confusion occurred to him at the time Yahya Al-Qattan narrated it, which took the hadith out of its proper form. The hadith after this was extracted by Ibn Abi Shaybah in Al-Musannaf (4/64; no. 17828) from Ghundar, from Shu'bah, from Al-Hakam - meaning: Ibn Utaybah - from Ali bin Husayn; and he mentioned it. Ibn al-Ja'd followed Ghundar from Shu'bah with it in his Musnad (1/54; no. 425), and from his path Abu Bakr al-Bazzar extracted it in Al-Ghaylaniyyat (134; no. 91). And every narrator of the correct version of the hadith above has a trustworthy follower; Yahya bin Sa'id was followed by Hushaym bin Bashir in Sunan Sa'id bin Mansur (1/292; no. 1034) and he was discussed. Al-Ajlah was followed in Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (4/64; no. 17827) by Mu'arrif bin Wasil, and Ibn Ma'in declared him trustworthy in the narration of Al-Kawsaj and Ahmad and Al-Nasa'i (Tahdhib al-Kamal: 28/261). And Habib was followed by Abu Ishaq al-Sabi'i - and he is who he is - in Al-Sunan al-Kubra by Al-Bayhaqi (7/256; no. 14891). \n3.

So I said: I want [6] the hadith of Matar; so he narrated it to me after difficulty (3).",

He is Al-Aswari. [3] Not in Al-Du'afa'. [4] Al-Uqayli's book: 'From'. [5] Added in Al-Kamil: 'After his pardon and taking'. [6] Al-Uqayli's book: 'I want it from'. _________ \n1. Al-Du'afa': 1364/4; no. 1812; Al-Kamil: 396/6. \n2. The author said in his History (303): 'Matar Al-Warraq died in the year one hundred and twenty-nine, and he is Matar bin Tahman'. Abu Dawud in Su'alat Al-Ajurri (2/71; no. 1164): He is not a proof according to me. And Matar is not relied upon in a hadith if there is disagreement. \n3. Yahya bin Sa'id al-Qattan deliberately turned away from the hadith of Matar from Al-Hasan to others in both cases - this one and the one immediately following - and the reason is his disapproval of him; therefore he did not narrate from him except with reluctance, evidenced by Al-Fallas's saying in both instances: 'So he did not narrate it to me except after difficulty'. His turning to Musa bin Sayyar Al-Aswari Al-Basri is only proof of his extreme hesitation to narrate from Matar, and it does not necessitate or imply at all that his Isnad is straight, so do not rejoice in it; for Al-Qattan said: 'His hadith is nothing' (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 8/146; no. 659), and he was 'among those pointed at for Qadar (free will dogma), weak in hadith', said by Al-Daraqutni in his comments on Majruhi Ibn Hibban (230; no. 299). And Abu Dawud said in Su'alat Al-Ajurri (2/16; no. 978): 'Yahya narrated from him then abandoned him', so perhaps this hadith is from Yahya's narration from him before abandoning him. The discussion is about the Isnad below Al-Hasan, but as for what is above him, Al-Hasan's Mursal narrations are disputed; they are weak according to Ahmad and Al-Tirmidhi, while Al-Qattan and Abu Zur'ah Al-Razi saw that these Mursal narrations have bases except for two or four hadiths (See: Sharh 'Ilal Al-Tirmidhi by Ibn Rajab: 1/536). In any case, Mursal is outside the circle of argumentation - mostly -, and the hadith is weak from this aspect, and its defect is Matar; for he is weak, a Mudallis, and used 'an'ana. We do not know if Yahya heard from Matar or not? Although history allows it, for Matar died in the year =",

[3] In Al-Du'afa': 'Yujaz' (is validated), and it has a basis. _________ = 129 AH according to Amr bin Ali in his History (303) - which is the source - and he died before that according to others by four years, and Yahya was born in the year one hundred and twenty as Al-Fallas transmitted in this book of ours (110), so he was a discerning boy the day Al-Warraq died, so his hearing from him is possible, but we did not find anyone who affirmed or mentioned it, and had Amr bin Ali recounted Yahya's Isnad in this hadith as he did in the one following it, we would have verified this matter. What remains at hand is that Yahya does not narrate from Matar except through an intermediary, who is here Sa'id bin Abi Arubah, and he is likewise from Al-Hasan via Mursal in Al-Sunan Al-Kubra by Al-Bayhaqi (54/8; no. 15824); and its defect is as preceded. As for Sa'id, although he used 'an'ana for the hadith from Al-Hasan, they affirmed his hearing from him, and did not mention him among those who practiced Tadlis from him (See: Tarikh Amr bin Ali: 586-587). The hadith with its paths is weak from this aspect. And Sayyar's narration - despite its weakness - is one of the benefits of the book, for I did not find it with anyone other than Al-Fallas, and he is the authority on it for the transmitters. The hadith was narrated from Al-Hasan connected, from Jabir elevating it, via Hammad also, from Matar with it, by Abu Dawud in his Sunan (293/4, 4509), and from his path Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Sunan Al-Kubra (96/8; no. 16046), and Ahmad in his Musnad (363/3; no. 14954), but in all of them is: 'I reckon it from Al-Hasan' with uncertainty, and it is further defective due to Al-Hasan not hearing from Jabir (See: Al-Marasil by Ibn Abi Hatim: 36; no. 112). Likewise - i.e., via Hammad - Al-Tayalisi extracted it in his Musnad (3/320; no. 1872), with ambiguity of the narrator from Jabir, and it is interrupted (Munqati'). \n1. Musaddad bin Musarhad extracted it in his Musnad (quoted from Ithaf al-Maharah al-Khayarah: 4/104; no. 1/3238; Al-Matalib al-Aliyah: 6/385; no. 1197; 8/76; no. 1558), he said: Yahya narrated to us, from Ibn Abi Arubah, from Matar, with it. Al-Busiri said following it: 'This is an Isnad whose men are trustworthy'. And Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in Al-Sunan Al-Kubra (7/347; no. 14216), via Muhammad bin Yahya, Abdullah bin Bakr narrated to us, Sa'id narrated to us, from Matar; and he mentioned it similarly. I say: Al-Busiri's previous comment is a general authentication, otherwise Matar is not approved by Al-Qattan due to his poor memory, for he used to compare him to Ibn Abi Layla - specifically regarding Ata - (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 8/288) =",

[2] 'From Ali': missing from both editions of Al-Du'afa'. _________ = for that reason he turned away from him. The hadith is Mursal, for Al-Hasan did not hear from Ali; 'because Ali went out to Iraq following his pledge of allegiance, and Al-Hasan resided in Medina so he did not meet him after that' (Jami' al-Tahsil by Al-Ala'i: 162; no. 135). \n1. Al-Fallas said: Maymun bin Musa Al-Mar'i, weak (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 237/8; no. 1065), and said another time: Truthful (Saduq) (Al-Kamil: 415/6). I say: There is no contradiction, if he meant truthful in himself, weak in hadith. And Al-Fallas also said: 'I heard Abd al-Samad bin Abd al-Warith say: I heard Khalid Al-Abd - weak - say: Al-Hasan said: I prayed behind twenty-eight Badris (veterans of Badr) all of whom performed Qunut in Fajr after bowing. So I said to him: From whom did you hear this? He said: From Maymun Al-Mar'i. Abd al-Samad said: So I met Maymun Al-Mar'i and asked him, he said: Al-Hasan said: I prayed behind twenty-eight Badris. So I said: From whom did you hear this? He said: Khalid Al-Abd narrated to me. (Al-Tarikh al-Awsat: 556/3; no 843; Al-Tarikh al-Kabir: 165/3; no. 567; Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 237/8; no. 1065; and the context of the report is from the second, and there is difference in it). If both parties were equal in the probability of lying - since it is necessary that one of them is lying in this report at least - our companion would have been cleared, but the dominant opinion is directed towards the defect being Khalid Al-Abd, not Maymun, for Al-Bukhari said: 'Amr bin Ali accused him of fabrication' (Al-Tarikh al-Awsat: 408/3; no. 619), not to mention that Maymun was not explicitly criticized for other than Tadlis. Ahmad: Maymun used to practice Tadlis, and used not to say: Al-Hasan narrated to us, and I see no harm in him. (From Ibn Shaqla's quotes from Al-Saji: 256; no. 342; Al-'Ilal wa Ma'rifat al-Rijal: 523/2; no. 3450; Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 237/8; no. 1065). Al-Bukhari said: Abu al-Walid - he is: Al-Tayalisi - said: Maymun brought out a book to us and said: If you wish I will narrate to you what I heard from him, and if you wish I wrote in it from everyone. So we said: Narrate to us what you heard; so he narrated four things to us that have no Isnad (Al-Tarikh al-Kabir: 342/7; no. 1470). Abu Hatim: Truthful (Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 237/8; no. 1065).

And Al-Nasa'i said: Not strong (Al-Takmil: 304/1-305). And Abu Ahmad al-Hakim said: Not strong according to them (Tahdhib al-Tahdhib: 351/10; no. 704). And Al-Saji said: He used to practice Tadlis (Tahdhib al-Tahdhib: 351/10; no. 704). Ibn Hibban: Rejected in hadith (Munkar al-Hadith), narrates from trustworthy narrators what does not resemble the hadith of the reliable ones, it is not permissible to use him as proof if he is alone (Al-Majruhin: 6/3). I say: And he wrote a biography for him in Al-Thiqat (9/174; no. 15840). \n1. Al-Fallas followed his rival Bundar, via Al-Saji in Al-Kamil by Ibn Adi (9/699; no. 16505), and from the same path Al-Bayhaqi extracted it in Al-Sunan Al-Kubra (5/106; no. 9163); and in both Maymun used 'an'ana; unlike what is with the author where there is declaration of hearing, which is an added benefit for defects; Ibn Adi said (9/699): 'And this Maymun is rare in hadith, and if he says \"Haddathana\" (narrated to us), he is truthful; because he was accused of Tadlis'. I say: And he has declared hearing so there is no problem. This hadith might be among what was authentic for Yahya Al-Qattan from Maymun, for Ibn Shaqla Al-Baghdadi in his Turar from Al-Saji (257; no 343), attributed to Yahya his saying: 'I came to Maymun Al-Mar'i, and he did not validate for me except these hadiths which you heard', then Zakariya bin Yahya cited after it examples of his hadiths, including this hadith. I do not know if he counted it among his rejected narrations or among what is authentic from him, and the apparent is that it is from the first; because the custom of authors on weak narrators is to append the biography with examples of the narrator's rejected narrations, and Al-Saji has an excuse in citation, for Maymun used 'an'ana in his narration, and the narration of declaration did not occur to him. In any case, this alternative Isnad which Yahya approved and sought to shift to from Matar's hadith, is more exemplary and a better guided path, but it is necessary to point out that Yahya's narration from Maymun in this context is closer to exercising comparison than to abstract authentication, for the story is in discussion (Muzakarah), and in it is permitted what is not permitted in dictation and hearing sessions. We conclude with that, that the hadith from this aspect has gathered two conditions strengthening it: First: The narrator who practices Tadlis declaring narration in it. Second: Its inclusion in what Yahya heard from Maymun, and his condition has passed with us - in addition to being strict -. Thus; it may rise to be Hasan by this consideration, and Allah knows best.",

Ibn Abd al-Barr summarized the report and gave its meaning in Al-Intiqa' (28), and Ibn Abi Hatim acted by abbreviating Al-Fallas's report in two places: - First (5/326; no. 1545): 'Amr said: I mentioned to Yahya bin Sa'id the saying of Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi: That Malik in Nafi' is more established than Ubaydullah bin Umar. So he got angry and said: He is more established than Ubaydullah?!'. This exact amount was extracted via Ibn Abi Hatim by Ali bin Al-Mufaddal Al-Iskandarani in Al-Arba'in 'ala Al-Tabaqat: 170. - Second (8/205; no. 902): 'Amr bin Ali Al-Sayrafi said: I heard Abd al-Rahman say: Malik narrated to us, from Nafi'. Then he said: He is more established than Ubaydullah, and Musa bin Uqbah, and Isma'il bin Umayyah, from Nafi''. Ibn Abi Hatim abbreviated the report once again more than before; that is his saying (1/15): 'I heard Abd al-Rahman - meaning: Ibn Mahdi - say: Malik narrated to us, from Nafi', - then he said: He is more established than Ubaydullah, and Musa bin Uqbah, and Isma'il bin Umayyah'. \n2. Yahya's stance here, contrary to it was transmitted from him - i.e., agreeing with Ibn Mahdi - and that is what became famous about him. In Tarikh Al-Muqaddami (202; no. 998) he said: 'My father narrated to me, he said: Abu Bakr bin Abi Al-Aswad narrated to us, he said: I asked Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Qattan and said to him: O Abu Sa'id, which is more beloved to you, Ubaydullah from Nafi', or Malik from Nafi'? He bowed his head then raised it and said: Malik was a Hafiz'. More explicit than it, also from Al-Muqaddami (206; no. 1008) he said: (I heard Al-Shahidi say: Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Qattan used to hold that the most established of people in Nafi' is Malik bin Anas; I mentioned that to Abu Al-Walid Al-Tayalisi as if admiring it and said to him: Then where is Ayyub Al-Sakhtiyani? He said: That is how Yahya used to hold). End. If we could verify which of the reports is earlier in history, we would have distinguished between the two stances. Ahmad made the most established in Nafi' Ubaydullah, then Ayyub, and delayed Malik after them (Su'alat Abi Dawud: 213; no. 174). Ibn al-Madini prioritized Ayyub over everyone, seconded with Malik, and thirded =",

Evidence for the opposition of these is what Al-Farra' narrated in Kitab Lughat Al-Qur'an (155) from one of them, Salam bin Sulaym: Abu Al-Ahwas narrated to us, from Ash'ath bin Abi Al-Sha'tha Al-Muharibi, from Alqamah bin Qays, that he read: 'Khatamuhu Misk', and said: Did you not hear the woman say to the perfume seller: 'Make for me its seal (khatamahu) musk', meaning: its end'.

[5] In the original: 'Umar'; which is a misspelling, the correct is what I established. _________ = 'Yazid', in the books of Ibn Wahb, Ibn Abi Al-Dunya, and Al-Bayhaqi, leading to confusion between two narrators both from the same layer, and this passed on some early scholars like Isma'il bin Ulayyah, so Yahya bin Ma'in said in his history (Al-Duri: 4/273; no. 4339): 'And Isma'il also narrated, from Isra'il, from Abu Ishaq, from Yazid bin Mu'awiyah, that Salman made them read while he urinated. Yahya said: It is only from Abu Ishaq, from Zayd bin Mu'awiyah Al-Absi. Yahya said: And Yazid bin Mu'awiyah is Nakha'i, companion of Abdullah. Yahya said: Isma'il said: By Allah I do not distinguish between them'. Al-Khatib distinguished between them in Tali Talkhis Al-Mutashabih (1/288; no. 177-176). Zayd intended in the chain, Al-Bukhari wrote a biography for him in Al-Kabir (3/406; no. 1349) and Ibn Abi Hatim in Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil (3/572; no. 2593), - and neither mentioned any disparagement or praise for him - and Ibn Hibban in Al-Thiqat (6/317; no. 7903), and it was said: He mentioned him in the appendix to his Majruhin, and others accepted him (Mizan Al-I'tidal: 2/106; no. 3026). Al-Ijli said in Ma'rifat Al-Thiqat (1/379; no. 531): Kufan trustworthy. \n1. He is: Muhammad bin Abi Adi, he is: Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abi Adi, and he is trustworthy. \n2. I do not know the reason for this referral; is it because Al-Qattan knew that Ibn Abi Adi's hearing from Sa'id was during confusion, so he disdained asking him himself, but wanted to verify his narration regarding this specific hadith, to consider it with others' narration, or is it elevating Muhammad with his students, as Sheikhs used to refer to each other, and send their students to ask them, as a metaphor for competence and appreciation, and the indication of both assumptions is that he was knowledgeable of Sa'id's hadith, so he would not ask about it, Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi said: 'Yahya bin Sa'id is knowledgeable of the hadith of Sa'id bin Abi Arubah' (Al-'Ilal wa Ma'rifat al-Rijal: 2/338; no. 2494).

And Abu Ayyub, his name is Yahya bin Malik, and it is said: Habib bin Malik, Maraghi Azdi Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir: 8/303; no. 3091; Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil: 9/190; no (72). And Amr bin Sufyan Al-Bakali: His companionship is disputed (See: Al-Inabah ila Ma'rifat Al-Mukhtalaf fihim min Al-Sahabah: 67-66/2; no. 754). We did not find the narration of Sahl bin Hassan and his question to Ibn Abi Adi. But the hadith from Ibn Abi Adi, Al-Tabari extracted it in his Tafsir (15/297), from Muhammad bin Bashshar, from Ibn Abi Adi with it. And its completion: 'He said: A deep valley separating the people of misguidance and the people of guidance, and the people of Paradise and the people of Hell'. It is suspended from Al-Bakali in Tafsir Ibn Abi Hatim (7/2368; no. 12858). There is a defect in the chain, which is that Ibn Abi Adi's hearing from Sa'id was after confusion, Ibn Rajab quoted in Sharh 'Ilal Al-Tirmidhi (2/745) from Al-Ijli saying: 'Narrated from Ibn Abi Arubah during confusion Yazid bin Harun, Ibn Al-Mubarak, and Ibn Abi Adi, everything narrated from him by such young ones is during confusion'. I say: But this speech from Al-Ijli is cited in Ma'rifat Al-Thiqat (1/394; no. 576) in the biography of Sa'id bin Iyas Al-Jurayri, and I think it is an error in attribution, occurring during arrangement by Al-Subki or Al-Haythami or the one transmitting from them. More upright than it for what we seek is the saying of Imam Ahmad: 'Yahya bin Sa'id used to say: Ibn Abi Adi came to Sa'id bin Abi Arubah at the end; meaning: while he was confused' (Al-'Ilal wa Ma'rifat al-Rijal: 1/353; no. 671), and via his son Al-Uqayli extracted it from him in Al-Du'afa' (2/467; no. 2117). As for Al-Bukhari's narration from him - despite what passed - from Sa'id in one hadith, perhaps it was authentic to him from other less elevated paths. Ibn Abi Adi was followed in similar to the hadith above in Tafsir Al-Tabari (15/297) from Yazid bin Zuray', from Sa'id, from Qatadah, from Amr Al-Bakali and added - from Amr bin Abdullah -, but this chain is also interrupted, for between Qatadah and Al-Bakali is a man, Abu Ayyub or someone else. Were it not for that, it would have been better, for Yazid bin Zuray' is more correct in Ibn Abi Arubah from Qatadah than others; Ahmad said in his Answers to Abu Dawud (336; no. 492): 'Sa'id bin Abi Arubah used to memorize Tafsir from Qatadah, and if you wrote it from Yazid bin Zuray' from Sa'id, then do not mind not writing it from anyone else' (347; 532).",

    "foot_note": "1. [1] A blank space the size of two words, and we only described this to you even if its disruption of the context of speech did not become clear to us, to be free of liability, and out of eagerness for the reader to see the original manuscript through our eyes, and the following comment witnesses to what we said, so look at it if you please. _________ = the critics being in the later time of the narrator is more decisive in judging him than those who preceded and did not accompany the investigation of his condition. Furthermore, the hadith of Abu Mu'awiyah from Al-A'mash from Amr is a strong authentic chain, which cannot be rejected merely by knowing the nature of the narrator and the probability that he would say such a thing or not; because it is countering proof with the semblance of a proof; therefore, if Al-A'mash said he heard Amr, then he has spoken the truth. This is supported by the saying of the Imam of the Craft in *Al-Kabir* (6/368; No: 2662) about Amr: 'He used to say: I am a Murji', and the saying of Abu Hatim in *Al-Jarh* (6/258; No: 1421): 'He used to hold the view of Irja', and they did not attribute it to anyone, relying on the fact that the report was widespread about him regarding that. Rather, his place in truthfulness, worship, and knowledge led people to imitate him in his doctrine even if he did not call to it; Muhammad bin Humaid Al-Razi said: Jarir told us, from Mughirah, he said: 'There remained some good in the people until Amr bin Murrah entered into Irja', so the people flocked into it' (*Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 22/236; No: 4448). \n1. In the connection of this report to the previous one is a subtlety, which is that Amr bin Murrah narrates from Yahya bin Al-Jazzar. See: An example of his narration from him in *Musnad Abi Ya'la*: 9/133; No: 5208. \n2. He is: Ibn Utaybah. \n3. He is: Al-Urani Al-Kufi. Shu'bah: Yahya bin Al-Jazzar did not hear from Ali except three things; - and he mentioned two of them - (*Al-Du'afa* by Al-Uqayli: 6/350; No: 6577). Ibn Sa'd: - after his recounting of Yahya's saying above -: 'He was trustworthy, and he has hadiths' (*Al-Tabaqat Al-Kabir*: 8/412; No: 9307). And the two Razis, Abu Hatim and Abu Zur'ah, declared him trustworthy (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 9/133; No: 561). Al-Ajli: Kufan, trustworthy, and he used to contain Shi'ism (*Ma'rifat Al-Thiqat*: 2/350; No: 1967). Al-Juzajani: He was extreme, excessive (*Ahwal Al-Rijal*: 43; No: 13). I say: Al-Juzajani's saying is not accepted absolutely, for he was a Nasibi, resentful of the Shi'a, so it is like the testimony of an innovator against another. As for the narrator, none of these stripped the description of trustworthiness from him, and they obliged him with Shi'ism without him calling for it, and were it not for that, most of the Six would not have narrated from him except Al-Bukhari. It is as if Ibn Adi was constrained by inserting him into *Al-Du'afa*, =",

Ahmad bin Hanbal followed Al-Fallas from Yahya in *Al-Ilal wa Ma'rifat Al-Rijal* (3/93, No: 4334) and *Tarikh Ibn Abi Khaythama* (A piece from the Kufans: 155; No: 367), except that he replaced 'Ali' with 'Shi'ism'. And from him Al-Uqayli in *Al-Du'afa* (6/350; No: 6575), and Ibn Sa'd appended it from Yahya with a chain in his *Kubra Tabaqat* (8/412; No: 9307), and without a chain, Al-Fasawi in *Al-Ma'rifah wa Al-Tarikh* (3/121). \n2. Ibn Al-A'rabi extracted it in his *Mu'jam* (1/172; No: 293) from Muhammad bin Isa, from Abu Hafs and he mentioned it, and from his path Ibn Asakir in *Tarikh Dimashq* (44/385). The report also occurred in *Jawabat Abi Dawud Al-Sijistani* to Abu Ubaid Al-Ajurri - with his hearing from him - (2/121; No: 1309), with the wording: 'Shu'bah said: I have not written from anyone unless he prioritizes Abu Bakr and Umar'. The benefit of the original narration is restricting the absolute nature of the second narration, and specifying it to Kufa. Abu Dawud cited an example of these Kufans in a place distant from the first, saying (1/229; No: 275): 'Ibn Idris, Za'idah, and Malik bin Mighwal prioritize Abu Bakr and Umar.' Close to it is the saying of Abu Yasir: I have not met anyone except that he prioritizes Abu Bakr and Umar (*Mu'jam Ibn Al-A'rabi*: 1/234; No: 430). \n3. The meaning of the report is not the prevalence of prioritizing the two Sheikhs (Abu Bakr and Umar) in Kufa, for the reality is contrary to it. Rather, his intent is that Shu'bah, due to his extreme caution, turned away from those who prioritized Ali and did not write from them. Witness to what we said is that Zaid bin Al-Hubab said: 'The opinion of Sufyan Al-Thawri was the opinion of his Kufan companions; he preferred Ali over Abu Bakr and Umar, but when he came to Basra he retracted it, and he prefers Abu Bakr and Umar over Ali, and prefers Ali over Uthman' (*Hilyat Al-Awliya*: 7/31).

He said: Ali was more beloved to me than Uthman, then Uthman became more beloved to me than Ali (*Ma'rifat Al-Thiqat* by Al-Ajli: 1/460). \n4. In it is a rejection from Yahya of this speech by citing Al-Faruq's action, for if a preference had appeared to him, he would not have resorted to the Shura; so it appeared that Ali and Uthman are equal in Yahya's view like two racehorses or two knees of a camel; or Tawaqquf (suspending judgment), and this is what is famous about him.

I say: In none of what passed via Al-Thawri is there any mention of 'Ubaidah' at all. I found a follow-up (Mutaba'ah) for Ibn Abi Layla from Al-Sha'bi, which is the follow-up of 'Al-Haitham', via Abu Hanifa from him, in *Al-Sunan Al-Kubra* (8/140; No: 16187), and *Ma'rifat Al-Sunan wa Al-Athar* (12/108; No: 16056), and *Awali Al-Imam Abu Hanifa* (10; No: 3), and *Al-Arba'un min Hadith Abi Hanifa* (16; No: 3), regarding specifically silver. From the same path with a more complete context in Abu Yusuf's *Al-Athar* (221; No: 980), but in it is the ambiguity of the follower of Ibn Abi Layla by saying 'From whom he narrated'. The sources of this follow-up did not exceed naming 'Al-Haitham', without identifying him or removing the ambiguity, and I found Abu Hanifa narrating from Abu Ghassan Al-Haitham bin Habib Al-Sarraf, and Shu'bah advised Abu Awanah upon his departure to Kufa to stick to him (*Al-Ilal wa Ma'rifat Al-Rijal*: 3/414; No: 5800), and Imam Ahmad praised him and said: How good are his hadiths, and how strong is their uprightness, unlike what the People of Opinion narrate from him. End quote. And Ibn Ma'in declared him trustworthy. Abu Hatim and Abu Zur'ah said: Truthful, trustworthy (See: *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 9/81; No: 327). But Al-Mizzi in *Tahdhib Al-Kamal* (14/32 - 33; No: 3042) and his sources and followers did not mention this - as far as I strived - among those who narrated from Al-Sha'bi according to their habit in attempting to investigate the Sheikhs of the subject and narrators from him, so his being him in reality remains subject to doubt. Then I verified that it is him, praise be to Allah, when I found a weak hadith for him narrating from Al-Sha'bi from Jabir as stopped (Mawquf) in *Lisan Al-Mizan* (2/511; No: 3319), and the calamity in it is from someone below him; meaning: from Zaid bin Nu'aim, who is of unknown status (Majhul Al-Hal). Whatever the case, our intent is what witnesses to the occurrence of Haitham Al-Sarraf's narration from Al-Sha'bi, and it has occurred. The benefit of identification is confirming the follow-up for Ibn Abi Layla from this aspect in not mentioning 'Ubaidah', and prioritizing it, in addition to the narration of Al-Qattan and Sufyan and this one, which in their aggregate are stronger than Waki's narration, and that is why Yahya hesitated in accepting it - even though it falls within his hearings as indicated by the word 'I heard him' - citing the poor memory of Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman as a defect. \n1. *Al-Du'afa*: 4/1254; No: 1658; *Ta'liqat Al-Daraqutni ala Ibn Hibban*: 231; No: 301; *Hilyat Al-Awliya*: 7/181; and Abu Nu'aym said after it: 'Abu Dawud was solitary in it from Shu'bah'. - I say: He was not solitary in it, rather he was followed as will appear later in the extraction -.

Shu'bah said: So I asked Salama bin Kuhayl [5]; so he narrated it to me from Dharr, from Ibn Abza [6], from his father, from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (1).",

[5] In *Al-Hilyah*: 'So I was brought to Salama'. [6] (Saad): 'Abza'. He is Ibn Abd al-Rahman bin Abza. _________ = Shu'bah, so the combination of the two became consistent for them. The report occurred - from this aspect - abbreviated by mentioning its end in *Al-Kamil* (9/200; No: 15082). Ahmad bin Sulaiman followed Al-Fallas in the story, saying: 'Abu Dawud told us, from Shu'bah, he said: Ibn Abi Layla benefited me (narrated to me) from Salama bin Kuhayl, from Abdullah bin Abi Awfa, that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, used to perform Witr with three.' So I met Salama and asked him, and he said: Ibn Abd al-Rahman bin Abza told me. I said: He benefited me from you, from Abdullah bin Abi Awfa. He said: What is my fault if he lies about me! (From *Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 5/314; No: 5404; *Al-Kamil* by Ibn Adi: 9/200; No: 15084). Salama's expression of lying is not a critical judgment but an expression of his intense anger that Ibn Abi Layla was confused in reporting from him. \n1. This is another example of Ibn Abi Layla's poor memory, and the author placed it with the previous one as an introduction to Shu'bah's judgment - coming next - that he is the worst memory he has seen. The hadith in its proper form is in *Musnad Abi Dawud Al-Tayalisi* (1/441; No: 548), and its completion is: 'When he said Taslim he said: Glory be to the King, the Holy, three times raising his voice on the third.' The mentioned Dharr is Dharr bin Abdullah Al-Murhibi, Abd al-Razzaq named him in *Al-Musannaf* (3/32; No: 4696), and he is trustworthy. Ibn Abd al-Rahman is Sa'id, the most trustworthy of his brothers Abdullah and Alqamah, trustworthy (See: *Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 1/524; No: 2308; and its *Ikmal*: 5/318; No: 1999). Abd al-Rahman bin Abza, a Companion according to the correct view, among the young ones of them, only Ibn Hibban disagreed in this, counting him as a Tabi'i (See for details: *Al-Inabah ila Ma'rifat Al-Mukhtalaf Fihim min Al-Sahabah* by Mughlatay: 1/392 - 394; No: 631).

I say: His narrators are trustworthy, except that Ibn Artah is Salih Al-Hadith (good in hadith), in the saying of Yahya bin Ma'in (Al-Daqqaq: 76; No: 213), and he sends (Mursal) and obfuscates (Tadlis) (See: *Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 424/5), so his solitude is objectionable (Munkar). There is another problem, which is: Is the correction - Ibn Abza catching the Prophet - from his son Sa'id, or is it an appendix by Ibn Abi Khaythama on the chain? Whatever the case, Abd al-Rahman's young age does not harm; because his hadith with 'An' recounts the action of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, in his prayer, which is a repeated action that is easily established in the narrator's memory, unlike a mere saying, for in addition to possibly not being repeated, it requires greater discrimination. I have tracked some of Abd al-Rahman's hadith, and it appeared to me that most of it recounts the actions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, in prayer specifically. Of it is what Abu Dawud Al-Tayalisi narrated from him - with a chain containing discussion - he said: 'I prayed with the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and he used not to complete the Takbir' (*Musnad Al-Tayalisi*: 2/616; No: 1383); and what Abu Nu'aym narrated from him also, he said: 'I attended a funeral with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him ...' (*Ma'rifat Al-Sahabah*: 4/1823; No: 4604), except that its chain contains Muhammad bin Salim Al-Kufi, who is weak ... In addition to the hadith of clasping (Al-Salb) above, and these hadiths as you see are in the Book of Prayer, and I do not think this or what is in its meaning - if its chain is connected - falls into the Mursal of Companions, rather it is a purely connected transfer, and Allah knows best. Yunus bin Habib followed Al-Fallas from Dawud with it in *Al-Sunan Al-Kubra* by Al-Bayhaqi (3/60, No: 3869). And Bahz bin Asad and Khalid followed Abu Dawud from Shu'bah from Salama coupled with Zubaid, in *Sunan Al-Nasa'i* (3/244; No: 1732; 3/245, No: 1733), and Ali bin Al-Ja'd in his *Musnad* (1/86; No: 487), and from his path Abu Nu'aym extracted it in *Al-Hilyah* (7/181). Mansur bin Al-Mu'tamir followed Shu'bah in *Amali Al-Mahamili* from the narration of Ibn Al-Bayya': 1/337; No: 368), from Salama, and he did not mention Dharr.

As for the report in the copy of *Al-Du'afa* (C: 340 B), it is misspelled and severed in two places.

And the omission of 'Ibn' before 'Abi Layla'. Its benefit is declaring Sufyan and the text of the hadith together. And his saying: 'I do not know which of them' without addition, implies the meaning: I do not know them. And that is not intended; the correct is the phrase of the original with us. \n2.

Then I heard Yahya asked about him after that, so he said: This Sheikh was not firm.' And Ibn Hajar reported this amount in *Lisan Al-Mizan* (2/87; No: 1092). Ibn Abd al-Barr benefited in *Al-Istighna* (2/847; No: 1031) from Al-Fallas's report without attribution, saying: 'Abu Al-Ghusn Ishaq, he said: I disputed before Shurayh. Yahya Al-Qattan narrated from him then abandoned him, and said: He is not firm.' And Al-Daraqutni did likewise in *Al-Mu'talif wa Al-Mukhtalif* (4/1773). Al-Bukhari benefited in *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir* (1/399; No: 1270) regarding the biography of Abu Al-Ghusn from Al-Fallas, and declared that, saying: 'Ishaq Abu Al-Ghusn: I disputed before Shurayh ... his saying; Amr told me: Yahya bin Sa'id told us, he heard Ishaq, then Yahya abandoned him.' \n1. It is said: He is Juha. From *Alqab Ibn Al-Faradi* (2/214); and in it: 'Yahya bin Sa'id narrated from him then refrained from narrating from him. And he said: He was not firm. I heard Amr bin Ali mention him ...'. And the place of dots is deleted from the original of Abu Al-Walid. In *Al-Kashf wa Al-Bayan* by Al-Tha'labi (1/442): 'And from Abu Al-Ghusn nicknamed Hija'. And it is apparent that it is a misspelling of 'Bi-Juha'. \n2. Ibn Shumail said: Al-Jarad: A swelling in the back of the horse's hock that grows until it prevents walking and running. Abu Mansur said: And I have not heard it from other than him; and he is trustworthy and trusted. From *Taj Al-Arus*: 7/491 (Jarad). See: *Al-Talkhis fi Ma'rifat Asma Al-Ashya*: 339. \n3.

And it is an addition not present with Al-Bukhari in *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir* (2/213; No: 2231). From what we have cited, it is known that Ibn Hibban's mention of him in *Al-Thiqat* (6/144; No: 7087) is according to the condition of his book. \n1. Abu Ukashah Al-Basri; trustworthy.

There is a problem in identifying Al-Hasan, is he Ibn Ali or Ibn Abi Al-Hasan Al-Basri; for Sulaiman bin Ali narrated from both of them, he narrated from the first regarding the Qunut supplication, and it is most likely Mursal since Al-Hasan died early (d. 49 AH). Al-Mizzi counted the second among his sheikhs in his *Tahdhib* (12/47; No: 2552), and it occurred in *Tafsir Al-Tabari* (Hajar Ed: 8/356) and Al-Tha'labi (4/54): 'Sulaiman bin Ali Al-Raba'i said: I said to Al-Hasan: O Abu Sa'id'.

The meaning is that Sulaiman heard Al-Hasan Al-Basri mentioning it from Abu Al-Jawza' so he wrote it from him; due to the magnificence of Al-Hasan in his view, and that he does not narrate something like this except for its value and importance. \n1. Meaning: regarding fasting. Between this report and the one before it is a connection, which is Al-Raba'i's reporting from Abu Al-Jawza', just as he reports from Al-Hasan. \n2. Al-Askari restricted it thus in *Tashifat Al-Muhaddithin* (2/574) saying: 'And among the Tabi'in is a man whose Kunya is Abu Al-Bizri: The Ba has a dot under it, and after it is an open Zai, and the end of the name is an inclined Ya; his name is: Yazid bin Utarid, he narrated from Ibn Umar, Imran bin Hudair narrated from him.'

His hadith regarding Takbir in the two Eids is among what I did not find, and it is among the benefits of the book. Abu Al-Bizri is only known for the hadith of drinking while standing, and eating while walking, so see its extraction in: *Ithaf Al-Maharah* (9/401; No: 11547).

Ibn Shahin narrated the story from Ali in Tarikh Asma al-Du'afa wal-Kadhdhabin (67; Bio: 99, 172; No: 597). He added in the first place: 'Ibn Al-Madini said: And I saw this Abu Shaykh. He was here called: Jariyah bin Haram. He was a head in [the sect of] Qadar (predestination), and he was weak in Hadith. It is strange that Abu Ahmad Al-Hakim cited the story in two entries: The entry of Abu Al-Hasan Musa bin Dinar Al-Makki (3/300; No: 1385) - and this is its correct place - and the entry of Abu Al-Tayyib Musa bin Yasar Al-Makki, and based on that established the name of the narrator's father as 'Dinar' in the first, and 'Yasar' in the second. What mostly led him into this delusion is the misspelling of the name in one of the copies he relied upon. =",

It appears that Sufyan and his follower Yahya acted contrary to their narration, for in Sunan Al-Nasa'i Al-Kubra (1/339; No: 667): 'Amr bin Ali informed us, he said: Yahya narrated to us, from Shu'bah and Sufyan, they said: 'Amr bin Murrah narrated to us, from Ibn Abi Layla, from Al-Bara' bin 'Azib, that the Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, used to perform Qunut in Fajr and Maghrib.'

Al-Uqayli: He changed in the end of his life, there is disturbance in his hadith (Du'afa'uhu: 3/409). Ibn Hibban: Al-Mas'udi was truthful (Saduq) except that he became mixed up in the end of his life, a severe mixing up until his mind went. And he used to narrate what came to him, so he was carried [along], thus his old hadith mixed with his recent hadith, and it could not be distinguished, so he deserved abandonment (Al-Majruhin: 2/48; and Ibn al-Qattan inclined to this in Bayan al-Wahm wal-Iham: 4/176). And it is not permissible to discard all his hadith due to the claim of disturbance, but it should be tested and looked into; if it is distinguished by his time or place or his narrators, [it is accepted], otherwise it is weak. \n1. And with Al-Uqayli's chain to Ali bin Al-Madini from a long report: 'Yahya bin Sa'id said, and he was next to Mu'adh, and that was in Safar year one hundred ninety: The last I met Al-Mas'udi was the year forty-seven, or forty-eight, then I met him in Mecca the year fifty-eight, and Abdullah bin Uthman was with me that year, and Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi. Yahya said: And I did not ask him about anything' (Al-Du'afa: 3/411; No: 3274). I say: It appears from this report the specification of the year which was ambiguous in the text and that it is year 58, and Al-Mas'udi was then mixed up completely. The summary of combining between this report of Al-Fallas and the two that follow after an intervening report: - Year 53: Al-Mas'udi was correct/healthy, written from, Abu Qutaybah wrote from him. And Yahya Al-Qattan wrote from him before that in year 48 AH. - Year 54: His memory changed so he looked into the book, but Mu'adh met him this year in Baghdad, and did not deny anything from him, so perhaps that was the beginning of his mixing up without it overwhelming him, then everyone who heard from him was in Baghdad, so [it was] during the state of his mixing up. - Year 57 and after: He mixed up completely. Among those who wrote from him then was Abu Dawud. And Yahya and Ibn Mahdi met him in Mecca in the year that followed it so Al-Qattan did not ask him. So every story about the signs of his mixing up refers to this year and what is above it, so if it is correct that he died in year 160 AH, it is known that the duration of his mixing up was between two and three years, no more.",

And his broken chains (Maqati') are not considered, nor his Mursal narrations, nor the narration of the weak from him.' Ibn Adi: And Al-Awza'i narrated from this Abd al-Wahid more than one hadith, and I hope there is no harm in him; because in Al-Awza'i's narrations from him there is uprightness (Al-Kamil: 8/350; No: 13326).

[1] It occurred in the original: 'Bi-ashr sinin' (by ten years); which is a misspelling, its correction is from the author's Tarikh and what bears witness to it in what follows. _________ = also (106; No: 212): 'And Yahya bin Ma'in used to hold that Sa'id and Al-Hasan Al-Basri were born when two years remained of the caliphate of Umar bin Al-Khattab.' And with Ibn Zair's chain to Yahya bin Sa'id [I think: Al-Ansari] he said: 'I heard Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib say: I was born when two years had passed of the caliphate of Umar' (Mawlid al-Ulama wa Wafiyatuhum: 1/100). And Khalifah bin Khayyat said in the events of year 15 AH of his Tarikh (25): 'Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib was born when two years had passed of the caliphate of Umar.' See: Al-Hidayah wal-Irshad: 1/292; No: 402; Rijal Sahih Muslim: 1/237; No: 507. And Ibn Abd al-Barr preferred it so he said in Al-Tamhid (6/301): 'He was born when two years had passed of the caliphate of Umar bin Al-Khattab, and that was the year fourteen; this is the most famous thing regarding his birth and the most correct. And it was said: He was born when two years remained of the caliphate of Umar. And the People of Athar are upon the first.' And Ibn al-Qayyim is similar to him in his footnote on Sunan Abi Dawud (13/243-244) - for he corrected it and commented on Al-Mundhiri's statement: 'Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib, his hearing from Umar is not authentic' -: 'And it was repeated for him in this book in places, and by it Ibn al-Qattan and others defect the hadith of Sa'id from Umar, and it is a false defecting which the Imams denied, like Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ya'qub bin Sufyan and others. Ahmad said: If Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib is not accepted from Umar then who is accepted?. Sa'id from Umar according to us is a proof (Hujjah)... And it is not preserved from any of the Imams that he impugned the narration of Sa'id from Umar, rather they all met it with acceptance and ratification, and whoever does not accept the Mursal accepted the Mursal of Sa'id from the Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him... And the intent: That defecting the hadith by Sa'id narrating it from Umar is cold obstinacy. And the correct view: Is that he was born when two years had passed of the caliphate of Umar, so he would be eight years old at the time of Umar's death. So how can his hearing be denied, and the connection of his narration from him be impugned?'. \n1. Tarikh 'Amr bin Ali Al-Fallas: 357. \n2. Yahya bin Ma'in followed Al-Fallas in his Tarikh from the narration of Al-Duri (4/102; No: 3365, and it was also followed from Yahya via paths, in Al-Musnad Al-Ahmadi (30/286; No: 18344) and his Ilal (3/147; No: 4649), and in Al-Ma'rifah wal-Tarikh by Al-Fasawi (1/237).

    "foot_note": "1. = without what follows it (3/11) suspending the report from Yahya, but his investigator said: 'Mutarrif bin Tarif Al-Harithi', and it is not so. And Yahya's speech also entails, what Mutarrif's brother - Yazid bin Abdullah bin Al-Shikhkhir - said: I am older than Al-Hasan by ten years, and Mutarrif is older than me by ten years (Kubra Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd: 9/156; No: 9908). And Mutarrif is from the Followers (Atba'), born in the life of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, and Umar. \n1. Meaning: Ibn Sirin, and Anas is his brother. The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tarikh (285): 'They were six: Five brothers, and their sister Hafsah. And the oldest of them was Ma'bad bin Sirin, and Yahya bin Sirin, and Muhammad bin Sirin, and Khalid bin Sirin, and Anas bin Sirin - and he was the youngest of them.. And Hafsah bint Sirin.' \n2. Ibn Ulayyah also said it according to what is in Al-Tarikh al-Kabir by Al-Bukhari: 1/91; Tarikh Baghdad: 3/283; Tarikh Dimashq: 53/175. \n3. The author said in the Tarikh (284): 'Al-Hasan bin Abi Al-Hasan Al-Basri, and he is Al-Hasan bin Yasar... And they were three brothers: Al-Hasan, Sa'id, and Ammar. And Al-Hasan was the oldest of them, and Ammar was among the Weepers (Bakka'in).' I say: And the reason for specifying Sa'id without the other, even though Al-Hasan is older than both of them, is that Ammar - as it appears to me and Allah knows best - has very little narration, so for that Ali Ibn Al-Madini did not mention him in the naming of those narrated from among the children of the ten (119; No: 81), and he mentioned his two brothers. As for Sa'id, Ibn Sa'd wrote a biography for him in Al-Tabaqat Al-Kubra (9/178; Bio: 3884) and described him with narration saying: 'He was younger than Al-Hasan, and he narrated, and it was narrated from him.' And he also has a biography in Al-Hidayah wal-Irshad: 1/297-298; Bio: 411; Al-Ta'dil wal-Tajrih: 3/1239; Bio: 1292. As for Ammar, his biography is rare; yes, Al-Muqaddami mentioned him - by his bare name - in his Tarikh (88; No: 692), but I have not found for him except one hadith with his chain without its text, narrated by Al-Dinawari in Al-Mujalasah (6/334; No: 2728) he said: 'Ahmad narrated to us, Ibrahim bin Fahd narrated to us, Muhammad bin Kathir narrated to us, Hammad bin Salamah narrated to us, from Thabit, from Ammar bin Abi Al-Hasan a hadith he narrated; he said: And he was of the Weepers.' And the chain after this is weak due to the weakness of Abu Ishaq Ibrahim bin Fahd Al-Basri, Ibn Adi said (2/38): The rest of his hadiths are rejected (Manakir), and he is of dark/obscure matter.",

[1] (Sad): 'Ibn'. _________ = And his saying: 'And he was of the Weepers' is an indication that he is the one mentioned; as the exact phrase passed from the speech of Al-Fallas, but some of this hadith only established a single princely narration, and it is not sufficient to witness for him joining strongly among the narrators, so for that he was not addressed in the compilations of men (Rijal); and witnessing to what we said that he was not of the people of this affair, is what Abu Dawud Al-Sijistani said in naming the brothers (244; No: 831-834): 'Al-Hasan used to give verdicts to people in Basra; and as for Thabit he was in Khorasan raiding, and as for Sa'id he used to tell stories; so Ammar said: I am not of the verdict of this one, nor the raiding of this one, nor the storytelling of this one, I am dutiful to my mother, so the mother of Al-Hasan died, and she was Khayrah, so he went out in her funeral and prayed over her.' \n1. This is one of the places where I encountered difficulty in correcting, due to its extreme obscurity, for it occurred in the original manuscript: 'Al-Muhallab', - with a clear Mim then Ha - and I searched without benefit for this 'Qabisah bin Al-Muhallab', among those in whom the conditions of the author's mention are realized but I did not succeed, then it sparked in my mind that 'Al-Muhallab' is a misspelling of 'Al-Hulb', so with the slightest checking of sources I found him and found his attribution to Tayy, so praise be to Allah. \n2. See: Al-Tarikh al-Kabir: 7/177; No: 790; Al-Jarh wal-Ta'dil: 7/125; No: 716. And see: Models of his narration from his father in Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah: 3/73 No: 3126; 3/317; No: 3955; 17/419; 33360. And the thought regarding Ibn Abi Khaythamah in his Tarikh (Volume Three: 3/16; No: 3657) is that he cited the report mostly following Al-Fallas in the biography of Al-Hulb the father, according to what remains of it, as the place is deprived. And Hulb is a nickname/title, and his name is Yazid bin Qunafah (Tabaqat Khalifah: 69; Al-Jarh wal-Ta'dil: 9/284; No: 1199). Ibn Abd al-Barr said in Al-Isti'ab (4/2710): 'He came as a delegation to the Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, while he was bald, so he wiped over his head and his hair grew.' I say: So perhaps this is the reason for the nickname, indicated by the saying of Ibn Duraid in Al-Ishtiqaq (482): 'And Al-Hulb: Hair. And Al-Hulbah: A lock of hair. And it is said of the hair of the foal's tail when it first appears: Hulb.' Ibn Kathir said in Al-Takmil (4/133): And the People of Hadith say: 'Hulb', and some of them said: The correct is 'Hulab'. \n3. The author cited him in his Tarikh (474), among those who narrated from the Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, from Banu Layth bin Bakr.",

It is also from the path of Hushaim, from Al-Shaibani, from Abdullah bin Shaddad, in *Sharh Ma'ani Al-Athar* (1/462; No: 2663). \n2. *Tarikh Amr bin Ali*: 329; similarly. \n3.

He was unique - I think - in this lineage attribution, for I have not found it with anyone else. Banu Bada is a clan of Kindah. See: *Sifat Jazirat Al-Arab* by Al-Hamdani: 166; 171, 167. Ibn Hibban added in *Al-Taqasim wa Al-Anwa* (5/417) saying: 'Abu Al-Za'ra Al-Kabir (The Elder)' to distinguish him from Abu Al-Za'ra Al-Saghir (The Younger), whose name is Amr bin Amr bin Malik, the nephew of Abu Al-Ahwas. Ali bin Abdullah said: I do not know anyone who narrated from Abu Al-Za'ra except Salama bin Kuhayl, and the general narration of Abu Al-Za'ra is from Abdullah (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 5/195; No: 902). Regarding his biography in Al-Bukhari's *Al-Kabir*, he said (5/221; No: 720): 'He narrated from Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, regarding intercession: Then your Prophet will stand as the fourth of them'; whereas what is known from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, is: 'I am the first intercessor', and he is not followed [corroborated] in his hadith. End quote. I say: Al-Bukhari's citing of a defect specifically for this hadith is apparent, but some critics applied the ruling of his phrase 'he is not followed in his hadith' absolutely, such that it includes this mentioned one and others, and it appears it is so. For an induction of the usage of this phrase by the Imam - may Allah grant him the Abode of Stability out of His bounty - indicates that he is very cautious in restriction, and decisive in the return of the pronoun. However, the point of confusion is that he brought an example and followed it with an absolute judgment. His habit is that if he cites an example, he restricts the judgment to it, but if he uses the phrase absolutely without an example, it covers all the narrator's hadith, and this is clear. His habit is to say in restriction: He is not followed in *this*; he is not followed in his hadith from *so-and-so*; he is not followed *on it*; he is not followed in *this hadith*; and *this is a hadith* on which he is not followed; it is not authentic in my view and he is not followed *on it* ... among other phrases. So if he says 'He is not followed in his hadith', it is a judgment =",

The benefit of this summary is that the absolute judgment of the Imam - if verified - results in the weakness of Abu Al-Za'ra, and removes the authentication of those who authenticated him like Ibn Sa'd in *Al-Kubra* (8/291; No: 2915); and Al-Ajli in his *Thiqat* (2/65; No: 987); due to the majesty of Muhammad bin Isma'il [Al-Bukhari], and their inability to stand against him. \n1. *Tarikh Al-Fallas*: 329. \n2. This one and the one before him are among the narrators from Ibn Mas'ud for him. \n3. The author attributed his lineage to his father in another place in his history (460), saying: 'Awf bin Malik bin Nadlah Al-Jushami'. Ahmad said in his *Jawabat* (291-292; No: 341): 'Abu Al-Ahwas, the companion of Abdullah, used to tell stories (Qassas). He narrated a hadith from Ibn Umar, and from Abu Musa. He came to Basra and Al-Hasan heard from him.' I say: A report from him will come under number: 198. \n4. *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir*: 5/71; No: 179; in it is 'Husayn'; in diminutive form. But the author in two places in his history, in addition to this place in his *Ilal*, listed it in the magnified form. Abu Hatim was unique in *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil* (5/39; No: 175) by saying: 'And it is said: Ubaid Allah'. And there is no one following him [in this]. \n5. A Basran Tabi'i. Ibn Sa'd said (9/188; No: 3890): 'He had few hadiths, he narrated from Abdullah bin Abbas and Abdullah bin Al-Zubair.' Abu Hatim added in *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil* (5/39; No: 175) other than those mentioned: Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari, then said: 'Abu Raja' Al-Ataridi and Qatadah narrated from him.' With a similar meaning also in *Thiqat Ibn Hibban* (5/21; No: 3641), and see: The author's history (337). I say: Al-Tabarani said in the course of a chain in *Al-Mu'jam Al-Awsat* (5/215; No: 5124) 'from Abu Madinah Al-Darimi, and he had companionship (Suhbah)', but the critics rejected it. This report is relied upon from its context in counting the Companions, like Ibn Al-Athir in *Al-Asad* (3/110; No: 2896), and his source in it is Abu Musa Al-Madini; that is why Al-Dhahabi said in *Al-Tarikh* (2/1208; No: 278): 'It was said: He has companionship, but it is not correct.' All of this is based on the saying of those who did not consider them two different persons, and if they were indeed so, the distinction between them would not have been delayed until the era of Al-Tabarani, for that is unlikely in most cases, and Allah knows best. Imam Muslim reported in his *Kuna* (2/830; No: 3354) - and no one followed him in it - from Yahya that he said: 'Abu Hudhaifah'. And how close it is in script to 'Abu Madinah'.",

This report will be repeated by the author after a few pages. The author was followed regarding Yahya by Abu Ubaid in *Mu'jam Al-Sahabah* by Al-Baghawi (3/122; No: 1548) with the wording: 'I never took from a Sheikh except the spontaneous [easy] part (Al-'Afw).' \n2. Perhaps the meaning is: that he used to take what the narrator's mind allowed freely without initiating him with questioning, insistence, or annoyance; as understood from Yahya's saying: 'I never spoke to Ash'ath, and I did not take from him except his spontaneous [easy] part.' From *Su'alat Al-Ajurri*: 2/28 - 29; No: 1018. The term 'Al-'Afw' might also mean: the opposite of strictness, and this is realized by comparing it to a question by Ali bin Al-Madini, for he said: 'I asked Yahya about Muhammad bin Amr bin Alqamah, how is he? He said: Do you want the lenient view (Al-'Afw) or shall I be strict? I said: Rather, be strict. He said: Then he is not who you want; our sheikhs Abu Salamah and Yahya bin Abd al-Rahman bin Hatib used to speak [about him]. Yahya said: And I asked Malik bin Anas about him and he said something similar to what I told you; meaning: Muhammad bin Amr.' From *Al-Du'afa* by Al-Uqayli (C): 343 A; *Al-Ta'rif* by Ibn Al-Hadha': 3/804; No: 870. So what is gathered from what passed regarding 'Al-'Afw' are two meanings: First: Not pressuring the narrator in delivering his narration. Second: Lack of strictness that goes beyond the limit of moderation in accepting the narrator's report. \n3. *Al-Du'afa* (C): Folio 383 A; *Al-Kamil*: 7/75. This report will appear repeated in the future under number 294, but this one has a more complete context than the subsequent one, containing an explanatory addition not found in the other, which is his saying: 'He took them from Ali Al-Sa'igh'. Ibn Hibban in *Al-Majruhin* (3/79) and Al-Hakim in *Al-Madkhal* (4/107) quoted from Al-Fallas's words his saying: 'And Yahya used not to narrate from Al-Walid bin Jami''; and they did not quote the rest of it, so their limitation led to the opposite of the author's intent, and implied not considering Yahya's return to narrating from him, even though this stance of his is undoubtedly resulting from a reasoned critical review. The report occurred in Ibn Abi Hatim's book (9/8; No: 34) equally, except that he said: 'So when it was shortly before his death, he narrated to us from him' and did not mention a reason or a number. Nevertheless, Al-Fallas's report above retains a defect-related benefit in defining the number. Witness to it is the saying of =",

He is: Al-Walid bin Abdullah bin Jami' Al-Zuhri, from themselves [not a client]; Al-Fallas stated this in the chapter mentioning the people of Kufa in his history (436), and Ibn Zanjawiyah also mentioned him among the scholars of Kufa in his *Tabaqat* (79; my investigation). Yahya bin Ma'in said in *Ma'rifat Al-Rijal* from the narration of Ibn Muhriz (143; No: 403): Trustworthy, he is Zuhri, trusted, pleasing. And he said in *Al-Tarikh* from the narration of Al-Duri (1/221; No: 838): Trustworthy. Ahmad was asked about him and said: I know nothing but good (*Masa'il Harb bin Isma'il Al-Kirmani*; Last Section: 1269/3; No: 2165). And he said once: There is no harm in him (*Su'alat Abi Dawud*: 303; No: 378; *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 9/8; No: 34). Likewise said Abu Zur'ah regarding him (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 9/8; No: 34) and Abu Dawud in *Su'alat Al-Ajurri* (1/155; No: 21). Abu Hatim said: Salih Al-Hadith (Good in Hadith) (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 9/8; No: 34). Ibn Sa'd declared him trustworthy (*Al-Tabaqat Al-Kabir*: 8/473; No: 3395) and Al-Ajli (*Ma'rifat Al-Thiqat*: 2/342; No: 1943). The sum of Ibn Abi Hatim's words in his biography (9/8; No: 34) leads to the prevalence of his documentation over his weakening and its preponderance, as he did not cite a cause for disparagement in it. He has two hadiths in *Sahih Muslim* (3/1414; No: 1787; 4/2144; No: 2779), and one hadith in *Al-Adab Al-Mufrad* by Al-Bukhari (195; No: 555). Neither Al-Uqayli (6/221; No: 1925) nor Ibn Adi (10/267; No: 17410), despite their great celebration in collecting [weak narrators], found a foothold for his weakness from the words of the Imams other than this statement of Amr bin Ali alone, although they quoted it in full so they are absolved of liability; then Al-Uqayli added saying: 'There is disturbance (Idtirab) in his hadith.' If we do not consider Amr's statement brought by them - which is the cornerstone - and remove it, their quiver is empty of the best arrows. It is strange that Ibn Hibban lists him in *Al-Thiqat*, then says in *Al-Majruhin* (3/78 - 79): 'He was among those who were solitary from the firm narrators with what does not resemble the hadith of the trustworthy; so when that became excessive from him, arguing by him became invalid.' Al-Busti [Ibn Hibban] also made the truncated statement of Amr a support for his judgment. As for Al-Hakim, he said in *Al-Madkhal* (4/106 - 107): '[Muslim] narrated from him, from Abu Al-Tufail, from Hudhaifah, the hadith of his father in the Book of Jihad. He narrated from him in another place in the book as corroboration, and if he had not mentioned him it would have been more appropriate. For they narrated to us from Amr bin Ali, who said: Yahya bin Sa'id used not to narrate from Al-Walid bin Jami'. However, Muslim followed his condition in corroborating with lenient narrators if the origin was presented via a firm trustworthy narrator.' I say: As for Amr's statement regarding Al-Walid, I do not think it was hidden from Muslim, who is his student, and if it was hidden",

    "foot_note": "1. [1] Thus in the original, and in *Al-Du'afa* and *Al-Kamil*: 'I took them'; and I see, and Allah knows best, that the narration of the original is more correct; because it conveys an additional meaning not conveyed by the other. Its explanation: If Al-Fallas had verified Yahya's refusal to narrate from Al-Walid, then brought him his hadiths to make him hear them, that would be pushing his Sheikh away from his stance and duping him, and closest to detested prompting (Talqin), and that would not be hidden from the Sheikh, nor would the student dare to fall into such a prohibition. So the most likely is that it appeared to Yahya what inclined his opinion towards acceptance, so he took the hadiths that were previously discarded by him, and his student narrated them, and Allah knows best. [2] (Saad): 'Al-Hammal' _________ = from him even, inference by it has become irrelevant like yesterday; because Yahya retracted his abandonment, and narrated from him a hadith of hearing (Sama'), not a hadith of negotiation (Mudhakarah). Arguing by it for negligence is exactly like arguing by it for action. So rejecting his position at the end without evidence is stubbornness; because it takes the status of the abrogator over the abrogated. Al-Hakim repeated his statement relying on Amr's words also without completing them (4/158). The agreement of the strict critics in wounding him based on Amr's statement weakens their argument as passed, so it remains that the man is neither clearly weak nor a famous trustworthy narrator, but he is upright between that, and this is most similar to the condition of corroboration by him according to Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj, may Allah have mercy on him, and Allah knows best. Ibn Hazm - may Allah forgive him - ventured in *Al-Muhalla* (11/224) saying he is: 'Destroyed' (Halik), and added in his *Ihkam* (5/607) going further: 'Fallen, discarded.' I say: We have not known Muslim to establish hadiths in whose chains are destroyed people, and receiving Ibn Hazm's speech regarding narrators requires extra caution. \n1. Perhaps the meaning of his hadith being present in six with Al-Qattan is that they are the excellent ones from his chains, not all of them; given that the books of texts and extraction testify that they exceed this number. Or it may be intended that these six are all that occurred of his hadith to Ali Al-Sa'igh. Regarding Ali, I have not found anything of his biography, except that he is among the author's sheikhs, for he previously reported from him at the beginning of the book under number 13. \n2. *Al-Tarikh Al-Awsat*: 3/553; No: 839; *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir*: 7/93; No: 417; *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 1/241 - containing reordering and brevity that obscures the meaning; *Al-Du'afa* (C): Folio 310 A. And he limited himself in *Al-Majruhin* (2/193) to his saying: 'I heard Yahya bin Sa'id being asked about the hadith of Arif bin Dirham, so he resisted it.' \n3. The author mentioned Al-Jammal in his history when mentioning the people of Kufa (424): 'Arif bin Dirham =",

Al-Daraqutni said in his *Turar* (211; No: 272): 'Ibn Hibban's saying: Arif is from the people of Basra, is an error; Arif is from the people of Kufa, Shaibani.' But the Basrans narrated from him, so for that reason, he was confused with the people of Basra by those who counted him among them. 'He did not hear anything from Anas'; Abu Hatim said this in *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil* (2/80; No: 1732), and added: 'He is Salih Al-Hadith (Good in Hadith), there is no harm in him, Abu Nu'aym narrated to us from him' (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 44/7; No: 246). Ibn Hibban said in *Al-Majruhin* (2/193): 'Munkar Al-Hadith (Objectionable in Hadith) despite his scarcity [of narrations], I do not like arguing by him if he is solitary.' End quote. I say: His action of cutting the report without completing it is not sound, for he reached with it to 'So he resisted it.' Abu Ahmad Al-Hakim said: 'He is not solid (Matin). Yahya Al-Qattan narrated from him with dislike, so he narrated from him from Zaid bin Wahb' (*Thiqat Ibn Qutlubugha*: 7/121; No: 7754). Al-Bukhari cited a defect in *Al-Awsat* (3/555, No: 839) for the hadith which Yahya Al-Qattan rejected due to its contradiction to the famous Sahih from Ibn Umar, so he said: 'Isma'il told us, he said: Malik told me, from Nafi', from Ibn Umar, he said: The cow, the camel, and the sheep are not slaughtered except for one person. Then Al-Ju'fi added: And this is more correct than that.' I say: Al-Bukhari meant the apparent correctness of the chain, not the correctness of the ruling, for the non-sufficiency of the cow and the like for seven is among what Ibn Umar was contradicted in and retracted or paused upon. So if it is based on the correctness of the text - and that is far-fetched - then citing a defect in the hadith due to that is invalid; because it is founded on a ruling which Ibn Umar hesitated in and was contradicted. See the detail of his disagreement in *Al-Muhalla* by Ibn Hazm: 7/381 - 382. Perhaps Yahya, when he verified that the ruling of sufficiency for seven is reported and famous from various outlets and paths, found no escape from returning to narrate from Arif after refusing, due to the presence of witnesses corroborating this hadith of his. \n1. They declared him trustworthy. \n2. Al-Fallas narrates it from Waki' from Arif with it, in *Al-Du'afa* by Al-Uqayli (5/55; No: 4835).",

Two matters were reported as the reason for his descent from the rank of trustworthiness in two reports: First: From Yahya bin Ma'in who said: 'I heard Ali say: Sufyan claimed he said: Hisham bin Hujayr used to write his books unlike how people write; meaning: relying on his ability, so they became confused for him' (*Ma'rifat Al-Rijal* from Ibn Muhriz: 395; No: 1632). The benefit of the report - if authentic, given the place of 'claimed' in Ali's phrase - is that his disturbance is incidental after rectitude, so he is subject to review, not like one weak from the beginning who is discarded. Second: Abu Ubaid Al-Ajurri said: 'I heard Abu Dawud say: Hisham bin Hujayr was given the Hadd punishment in Mecca. I said: For what? He said: For what the people of Mecca are punished for (*Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 30/180; No: 6571. This did not occur in the printed *Su'alat Al-Ajurri*). This contains some ambiguity, for punishments vary accordingly, so the punishment for slander - for example - is unlike the punishment for adultery, so it is like an unexplained disparagement. It is gathered from what passed that the narrator's weakness is not of that severity, and that is why he is on the degree of approaching trustworthiness but not reaching it; Ali bin Al-Madini said: 'Yahya bin Sa'id mentioned: Amr bin Muslim, the owner of Tawus's hadith, so he moved his hand and said: I do not see Hisham bin Hujayr except as better than him.' Even though Amr's condition is close to Hisham's condition. And he added: I said to him: Should I strike out the hadith of Hisham bin Hujayr? He said: Yes.' This opinion of Al-Qattan - despite his abstaining from narrating from him - aligns with Ahmad's opinion that he is not strong and not extremely weak; so he is 'average' (Wasat) according to the expression of the Sheikh of the Craft Ali bin =",

From Ata bin Abi Rabah, he said: The master of the youth of the people of Sham is Sulaiman bin Musa (*Al-Ilal wa Ma'rifat Al-Rijal*: 3/234; No: 5026; *Al-Thiqat* by Ibn Hibban: 6/380; No: 8192). Muhammad bin Hisham Al-Mu'assim came and with him was Al-Zuhri and a group other than him, so Ibn Uyainah heard from them except Sulaiman bin Musa, so Ibn Jurayj discussed with him: From whom did you hear?, until he said: Did you hear from the tall blue-eyed one? That is Sulaiman bin Musa. Ibn Uyainah said: So I wanted to go out to seek him, but it was said: He left days ago (abbreviated from *Al-Tarikh Al-Awsat*: 3/266; No: 424). Ahmad with his chain from Ibn Jurayj, said: Sulaiman bin Musa was, and was; praising him (*Al-Ilal wa Ma'rifat Al-Rijal*: 2/564; No: 3667). Sa'id bin Abd al-Aziz Al-Tanukhi Al-Dimashqi addressed Abu Mushir saying: I have not seen anyone with better questioning than you after Sulaiman bin Musa (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 1/287). Ibn Sa'd: He was trustworthy, Ibn Jurayj praised him (*Al-Tabaqat Al-Kabir*: 9/460; No: 4693). Al-Darimi: I said to Yahya bin Ma'in: What is the condition of Sulaiman bin Musa regarding Al-Zuhri? He said: Trustworthy (*Tarikhuhu* via Al-Darimi: 46; No: 26; *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 4/141; No: 615; *Asma Shuyukh Malik bin Anas*: 206). Ali bin Al-Madini: Sulaiman bin Musa is criticized (Mat'un fihi) (*Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 2/536; No: 2260). And it occurred in *Du'afa Al-Bukhari* (from the narration of Musabbih bin Sa'id: 5 - F): 'Sulaiman was - meaning: Ibn Al-Fadl - and he had Manakir (objectionable reports).' He attributed it in *Al-Tarikh Al-Awsat* (3/225; No: 360) to Ibn Jurayj. And it appeared in the printed *Al-Du'afa* (69; No: 149): 'Ibn Jurayj said: And Sulaiman used to praise him.' I say: Attributing to Ibn Jurayj is undeniable, but attributing the aforementioned speech to him is the strangest misspelling, and for that reason, all sources were confused in transmitting it, and those who suspected the transmission added and estimated, without removing the anxiety of the text. The correct phrasing is what occurred in the copies of *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir* as a single saying (4/39; No: 1888): 'Sulaiman used to give Fatwa on Al-Adal (complex issues/constraints), and he had Manakir.' Al-Adal is the plural of 'Adalah' (muscle) and 'Mu'dilah' (dilemma); which is a sound meaning, indicating that the man is a jurist capable in new issues. How excellent is Imam Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him, for he coupled his judgment on him regarding containing narrations of Manakir, with a phrase suggesting the source of his weakness, which is his saying: 'He used to give Fatwa on Al-Adal', meaning that he is a jurist dominated by the language of jurists, so he conveys the meanings of Hadith with their wordings, and that is what Ibn Rajab, may Allah have mercy on him, clarified in *Sharh Al-Ilal* (1/424) when he said: 'And likewise Sulaiman bin Musa Al-Dimashqi the Jurist; he narrates hadiths with strange wordings'; he said it =",

Al-Bukhari also said: Sulaiman bin Musa is Munkar Al-Hadith, I do not narrate anything from him, he narrated hadiths, the generality of which are Manakir (*Tartib Al-Ilal Al-Kabir*: 257). For this reason, Ibn Abd al-Barr said as a justification: Al-Bukhari spoke about the hadiths of Sulaiman bin Musa, and impugned what he was solitary in among them (*Al-Istidhkar*: 14/154; No: 19802). Muslim narrated for him in the introduction of his book (1/15), and in its body (3/1177) as a witness. Abu Zur'ah mentioned him in *Kitab Asami Al-Du'afa* (328; No: 645). Abu Hatim said: His place is truthfulness (Sidq), and there is some disturbance in his hadith, and I do not know anyone from the companions of Makhul more knowledgeable in Fiqh than him nor more firm than him (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 4/142; No: 615. See also: 4/141, No: 615; 9/297; No: 1262). I say: It is among the fairest of opinions. Al-Nasa'i: One of the jurists, not strong in Hadith (*Al-Du'afa wa Al-Matrukun*: 186; No: 252) - he declared him acceptable (Mashshahu) -. Ibn Adi: A jurist narrator, trustworthy people narrated from him, and he is one of the scholars of the people of Sham, and he narrated hadiths in which he was solitary and no one else narrates them, and in my view he is firm and truthful (*Al-Kamil*: 5/241). Abu Ahmad Al-Hakim: There are some Manakir in his hadith (*Al-Asami wa Al-Kuna*: 1/289; No: 180). Abu Nu'aym: The most truthful truthful one, the most skillful jurist, Sulaiman bin Musa Al-Ashdaq (*Hilyat Al-Awliya*: 6/87). Ibn Hazm: Sulaiman is the jurist of the people of Sham, he caught the senior Tabi'in (*Al-Muhalla*: 7/324). Ibn Abd al-Barr: 'Most scholars of knowledge authenticate his hadith, because he is an Imam among the Imams of the people of Sham, and a jurist among their great jurists' (*Al-Istidhkar*: 14/154; No: 19803). As for citing a defect in some of his hadith narrated from Al-Zuhri due to the latter not knowing him, it does not necessitate removing trustworthiness from him; due to the possibility of Al-Zuhri forgetting, and that has happened to those higher than him. Furthermore, he was corroborated in this hadith; meaning: 'Any woman [who marries] without the permission of her guardian...' by other than a narrator, and it was said: The calamity in it is from someone else, and other things were said. Al-Hakim said in *Al-Mustadrak* (2/182; No: 2709): 'The hearing of narrators from each other has been authenticated and established by the narrations of the firm Imams, so these narrations are not defected by the hadith of Ibn Ulayyah and his questioning of Ibn Jurayj about him and his saying: \"I asked Al-Zuhri about him and he did not know him\"; for a trustworthy Hafiz may forget after having narrated it, and more than one of the Hafizs of Hadith have done so.' They have celebrated the discussion of this hadith, so see: *Tarikh Ibn Ma'in* narration of Al-Duri: 3/232; No 1089; *Al-Kamil*: 5/232; No: 7680, 5/233; *Kuna Abi Ahmad Al-Hakim*: 1/290 - 291; *Hilyat Al-Awliya*: 6/88; *Tadhkirat Al-Mu'tasi*: 22.

Shu'bah: Ubaidah informed me, before he changed (*Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir*: 6/128; No: 1925). Sibt Ibn Al-Ajami commented on it saying: It appears he meant by his change confusion (Ikhtilat), and he may mean his memory worsened (*Nihayat Al-Ightibat*: 234; No 68). Sufyan: His hadith is worth nothing (*Al-Ma'rifah wa Al-Tarikh*: 3/145). Usaid bin Zaid Al-Jammal said, from Zuhair bin Mu'awiyah: I suspected no one except Ata bin Ajlan and Ubaidah.

Ibrahim bin Ar'arah bin Al-Barand Al-Sami, Abu Ishaq, a great trustworthy Hafiz, agreed upon, extracted in the Two Sahihs; Al-Khalili said this in *Al-Irshad* (2/591; No: 298). Abu Hatim said: Truthful (Saduq) (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 2/130; No: 409). Ibn Abi Hatim said: My father and Abu Zur'ah wrote from him, and narrated from him (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 2/130; No: 409). Imam Ahmad had a bad opinion of him (See: *Tarikh Baghdad*: 7/75 - 78; No: 3139). \n3. He is: Hammam bin Yahya bin Dinar Al-Awadhi. \n4. Al-Fallas said (*Al-Kamil*: 5/385; 7/131; *Tarikh Al-Islam*: 5/398; No: 273): 'Yahya bin Sa'id told us, Shu'bah and Hisham told us, from Qatadah, from Jabir bin Zaid, from Ibn Abbas: - Shu'bah raised it (to the Prophet) - he said: 'The dog, the donkey, and the woman cut (interrupt) the prayer.' Abu Hafs said: So Affan said to him: Hammam told us, from Qatadah, from Salih Abu Al-Khalil, from Jabir bin Zaid, from Ibn Abbas. He said: So Yahya wept! And said: You have become bold against me ... my companions Khalid bin Al-Harth and Mu'adh bin Mu'adh are gone.' This report must be combined with a coming report under number 297, and see: The comment on it is necessary. I say: I think the story is evidence of Yahya's bad opinion of Hammam, Al-Muqaddami said in his history (202; No: 1000): 'My father told me, he said: I heard Ali say - and he mentioned Qatadah's companions - he said: Hisham Al-Dastuwa'i was the most withdrawn from him. Sa'id was the most knowledgeable of them about him. Shu'bah was the most knowledgeable of them about what he heard and what he didn't hear. Ali said: And Hammam in my view was not less than the people in Qatadah, but Yahya did not have a [good] opinion of him, while Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi had a good opinion of him.' Indeed, Ibn Abi Khaythama quotes Ibn Mahdi saying: 'Yahya bin Sa'id wronged Hammam bin Yahya, he did not have knowledge of him, nor did he sit with him, yet he attacked him' (*Ikmal Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 12/167; No: 4967). A group declared him trustworthy, and those who spoke against him spoke regarding his memory, but his book is good (Salih). See: Detailed sayings about him in *Ikmal Tahdhib Al-Kamal*.",

Either Ibn Mahdi narrated to Al-Fallas before the prohibition, or he retracted his abstention regarding this specific hadith, due to the presence of a follower (Mutabi') for Mujalid, for he is weak and what he is solitary in is not used as proof, and he used to accept prompting (Talqin) at the end - as indicated by a previous report of the author - not to mention that Abd al-Rahman used not to narrate from him from Al-Sha'bi and Qays bin Abi Hazim as in Al-Bukhari.

Ibn Hibban said: Among the masters of the people of Basra in Fiqh and knowledge, he narrates from a group of the Tabi'in (*Al-Thiqat*: 7/143; No: 9380). His biography was repeated so he added (7/152; No: 9426): 'He died in the year one hundred and sixty-eight and was a jurist.' In *Su'alat Al-Ajurri* to Abu Dawud: Is Ubaid Allah bin Al-Hasan a proof (Hujjah) in your view?. He said: He was a jurist (*Tarikh Baghdad*: 12/7; No: 4509). I say: This is avoiding the answer. Al-Nasa'i declared him trustworthy (*Tarikh Al-Islam*: 4/450; No: 262). See: *Thiqat Al-Ajli*: 2/109; No: 1153; *Tarikh Asma Al-Thiqat*: 166; No: 971. Ibn Qutaibah spoke harshly about him in *Ta'wil Mukhtalif Al-Hadith* (44); see: The account of that and the defense of him in *Al-I'tisam* by Al-Shatibi (1/147 - 148). \n2.

Comparing what is in Al-Bukhari's book with the original alerted to the existence of an omission in it resulting from shifting gaze, and that missing part is his saying: 'And I heard Yahya say: We came to Medina', and it comes immediately after his saying: 'In Medina the first; *Tarikh Al-Fallas*: 260 - 261; from his saying: 'So he said to me: Ubaid Allah told us' to 'Al-Hajj'. The investigators of *Al-Tarikh Al-Awsat* did not know Salim, thinking that the author's saying after this 'the brother of Ubaid Allah bin Umar' refers to him, but it is not so, rather the intended by that is Abu Bakr bin Umar, and they have an excuse, for the text is obscure. \n4.

Ibn Shahin said following it: 'This statement regarding Abdullah bin Salamah is heard from Ahmad bin Hanbal, due to his truthfulness regarding Sheikhs and his knowledge of what they narrated.

The author said in other than this book of his: If he narrates from the people of his land it is correct, and if he narrates from the people of Medina like Hisham bin Urwah, Yahya bin Sa'id, and Suhail bin Abi Salih, then it is nothing (Tahdhib al-Kamal: 3/176; No: 472). Another text from him about Ismail will come in this book. Ibn Al-Mubarak said: If Ismail and Baqiyyah agree on a hadith, then Baqiyyah is more beloved to me (Du'afa Al-Uqayli: 1/274; No: 391). Abu Ishaq Al-Fazari: That is a man who does not know what comes out of his head (Du'afa Al-Uqayli: 1/275; No: 393). And he said another time: Do not write from Ismail bin Ayyash from those he knows nor from those he does not know (Al-Du'afa: 1/277; No: 401). But Abu Ishaq had narrated from him then abandoned him, it reached him that he spoke ill of him. See: Kitab Al-Uqayli (1/275; No: 394). Yazid bin Harun: I saw Shu'bah with Faraj bin Fadalah asking him about the hadith of Ismail bin Ayyash (Summary from Musnad Umar by Ya'qub bin Shaybah: 102; No: 200). Yazid bin Harun: I have not seen a Levantine nor an Iraqi with better memory than him (Al-Jarh wal-Ta'dil: 2/191; No: 650). Al-Duri from Yahya: Trustworthy (His Tarikh: 4/411; No: 5032). And he was more beloved to him than Faraj bin Fadalah (4/457; No: 5278). And Yahya said: He used to sit with three or four people and read a book while they were with him, and people were gathered, then he would toss it to them and they would all write it, and no one looked in the book except those three or four. I witnessed Ismail bin Ayyash narrating like this so I did not take anything from him, but I witnessed him dictating, so I wrote from him (4/384; No: 4901). Al-Darimi said: I said to Yahya bin Ma'in: So Ismail bin Ayyash, how is he according to you? He said: I hope there is no harm in him (Al-Kamil: 2/83; No: 1814). Abbas, from Yahya, said: Ismail was more beloved to the people of Sham (Levant) than Baqiyyah, and Ibn Ayyash heard from Shurahbil, and Ibn Ayyash is trustworthy, and he is more beloved to me than Faraj bin Fadalah (Al-Kamil: 2/83; No: 1815). Ahmad bin Zuhair said: Yahya was asked about Ismail, so he said: There is no harm in him, from the people of Sham, and the Iraqis dislike his hadith. It was said to Yahya: Which of them is more firm, Baqiyyah or Ismail bin Ayyash? He said: Both are righteous (Al-Kamil: 2/83; No: 1818). Ibn Muhriz, from Yahya bin Ma'in: Trustworthy, if he narrates from a trustworthy person (118; No: 238). In Al-Fasawi's book: No one narrates more of the hadith of the Levantines than Ismail bin Ayyash and Al-Walid bin Muslim (Al-Ma'rifah wal-Tarikh: 2/165).

Between this report and the one following it in the original, there is a blank space the size of a line, and there is no reason for it; because the speech appears connected, and thus Al-Uqayli transmitted it. Yahya defected the hadith because it contradicts the requirement of the authentic established hadith that follows it. And the fact that it is from his hadith from the Levantines does not intercede for him, even though the speech of the Imams regarding preferring it over what he narrated from others has passed, for it is opposed by what is stronger. But one can escape [the contradiction] by saying the prohibition is not specific to eating leeks and garlic due to them entering the realm of permissible things, as it applies to attending the mosque for one who ate them, and it is answered that the Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, refrained from eating them absolutely for the sake of communion (Munajat), and that the hadith has also appeared absolutely without restriction to entering the mosque or otherwise.",

Al-Baji restricted himself in Al-Ta'dil wal-Tajrih (1/519; Bio: 274) to saying: 'He died in the year one hundred and forty-five', and Ibn Zabr (1/341) added to this amount: 'In the end of it', following what is in the author's Tarikh. \n1.

See: Al-Kamil by Ibn Adi: 3/396; and I think the defect in citation is from the scribe not from Ibn Adi's work, for he is trustworthy in transmission according to what appeared to us by tracking. And it appeared in Al-Baji's book (3/1229; Bio: 1273) the transmission from Al-Fallas, but with a difference in wording and sequence, and its context is: 'Ibn Abi Arubah did not hear from Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Ansari, nor from Ubaidullah bin Umar, nor from Abu Bishr, nor from Zaid bin Aslam, nor from Abu Al-Zinad.

Al-Dhahabi transferred in Al-Tarikh (4/62; No: 67) the beginning of the report to his saying: 'Bin Urwah'. The reason for the confusion of the transmitters from Abu Hafs is the difference in his own weaving of the speech about Ibn Abi Arubah between his book Al-Tarikh and this book Al-Ilal, then their coinciding in brevity on his speech in the two sources.

The occasion of mentioning Abu Makin coupled with Al-Shunni is that Yahya was asked about them together so he weighed between them, Ali bin Al-Madini said: I asked Yahya bin Sa'id about Umar bin Al-Walid Al-Shunni, so he gestured with his hand shaking it; as if he did not strengthen him, so I said 'Inna lillah', he said: What is wrong with you?.

Yahya was followed regarding Hisham by Waki' in *Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah* (5/ 351; No: 8191).

Yahya Al-Qattan said about him as in *Tahdhib Al-Athar* (4/ 296; No: 1615): 'There is no one in Kufa whose disagreement is heavier upon me than Yahya bin Zakariya'. Al-Tahawi said: And it is sufficient for a man that Yahya bin Sa'id says such a saying about him. \n3.

The author was followed regarding Mu'adh by Yahya bin Ayyub, in *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir* by Ibn Abi Khaythama (Volume Three: 1/ 279; No: 976), despite an obliteration that befell this place, what we have is useful in restoring it. Abu Dawud extracted it in *Al-Zuhd* (285; No: 337), he said: Ibn Abi Dawud Al-Anbari told us, he said: Abdah told us, from Zakariya, from Abbas bin Dharih, from Amir, he said: Aisha wrote to Mu'awiyah; so he mentioned similar to it.

He said: I said: Indeed some of them say: 'No Qadar', and some say: 'He decreed good and did not decree evil', and some say: 'There is nothing existing or will exist except the Pen has run with it'. He said: It has reached me that before you are Imams misleading the people, their saying is the first two sayings; so whoever you see among them as an Imam praying with the people, do not pray behind him. Then he was silent for a while, then said: And whoever dies among them do not pray over him, may Allah fight them, brothers of the Jews. I said: But I have prayed behind them. He said: Whoever prayed behind those must repeat the prayer. I say: In the printed version: 'O Abu Ja'far bin Muhammad bin Ali', inserting 'bin' after 'Ja'far'; and it is not correct.

I say: Launching such distinctions is relative and does not follow a disciplined logic, and it needs probing regarding each critic individually; while Ibn Mahdi considers the term 'Thiqah' higher than the term 'Khiyar', we find the opposite with Ahmad; as revealed by his answer to Abu Dawud, when he asked him about Sayyar Abu Al-Hakam: 'Is he among the Thiqat?'. He said: 'Yes, and above Thiqah, he was among the Akhyar (Good ones)'.

And Khalid is Ibn Mahran Al-Hadhdha'. _________ = And Abu Al-Ahwas was a storyteller (Qass), and that is suitable for the saying: 'He used to pour it upon us'; but he is safe from what is usually attributed to storytellers of license in narration and greed in it without verification, as explained by the report of Imam Muslim in the introduction of his *Sahih* (1/ 20), for he narrated from Asim, who said: 'We used to come to Abu Abd al-Rahman Al-Sulami while we were pubescent boys, so he would say to us: \"Do not sit with storytellers except Abu Al-Ahwas, and beware of Shaqiq\".' And confirming the report with Al-Fallas is the abundance of his narration from Ibn Mas'ud as is apparent in the books of Hadith texts; and among them in *Sahih Muslim* alone is a significant amount; Ibn Manjuwayh said in *Rijal Sahih Muslim* (2/ 99: 123): He narrated from Abdullah bin Mas'ud regarding Prayer, Virtues, Truthfulness, and Supplication'. The following report is a model cited by Al-Fallas for the narration of Abu Al-Ahwas from Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him. \n1. The author was followed by Ibn Sa'd in his *Kubra Tabaqat* (8/ 302; No: 8868). And Ahmad bin Ibrahim and Imam Ahmad together in his *Ilal* (3/ 244; No: 5076), and Imam Ahmad alone in *Musnad Ibn Al-Ja'd* (77; No: 424), and *Al-Jami' li-Akhlaq Al-Rawi* (2/ 61; No: 1184), and it is coupled to Al-Muthanna bin Mu'adh in *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir* by Ibn Abi Khaythama (Piece from the Kufans): 67 - 68; No: 70, and Al-Fasawi in *Al-Ma'rifah wa Al-Tarikh* (3/ 209). \n2. *Al-Muhaddith Al-Fasil*: 474; No: 569.

In this report, in addition to presenting the narration of Abu Al-Ahwas from Abdullah, is a sublime meaning, which is the sequence of the Hadith by hearing (Sama') except for one place - meaning: each narrator saying about the one he narrated from: 'I heard'. And its benefit is verifying Khalid Al-Hadhdha's hearing from Ali bin Al-Aqmar, and his narration from him is rare. \n3. Ali bin Al-Aqmar Al-Hamdani Al-Wadi'i; Ibn Zanjawiyah attributed his lineage in *Tabaqat Al-Fuqaha wa Al-Muhaddithin* (67); Al-Bukhari narrated a hadith for him from two paths (*Sahihuhu*: 7/ 72; No: 5398 - 5399), indeed the Group narrated for him.

The author's narration of Ubaidah's report and its wording via his sheikh Abd al-Wahhab Al-Thaqafi is among the unique items of the book, as I have not found it elsewhere. The famous wording of the report is: 'I accepted Islam two years before the death of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him', and this amount of it was extracted by Ibn Abi Khaythama in his history (Volume 2: 869/ 2; No: 3671) and Abu Nu'aym in *Ma'rifat Al-Sahabah* (4/ 198; No: 4818), and Al-Khalili in *Al-Irshad* (534/ 2) and Al-Khatib in his history (422/ 12; No: 5767), all three from Yahya bin Sa'id from Hisham with it. The addition to this amount from Yahya's narration from Hisham only occurred with Al-Fasawi in *Al-Ma'rifah wa Al-Tarikh* (229/ 1), and in it is: 'But I did not see him', and in it 'two years' (Sanatain) was replaced with 'two years' (Amayn). Ibn Abi Khaythama extracted it in his history (Volume Three: 134/ 3, No: 4143) from Mu'adh bin Mu'adh from Hisham with it. And Mu'adh added: 'And I did not see him'. He also extracted it from Abdullah bin Bakr Al-Sahmi (Volume Three: 3/ 135; No: 4144), and added: 'But he did not meet him'. The wording of the first person from the report: 'I prayed two years before the death of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him' solely, is extracted by Al-Bukhari in his history (82/ 6; No: 1776), from Abd al-Salam - I think he is Ibn Harb Al-Nahdi - from Hisham with it; and with the addition of the phrase 'and I did not meet him' to the previous amount for three: for Ahmad bin Bashir and Abu Usamah Hammad bin Usamah - and this path is according to Muslim's condition - both from Hisham with it, with Abu Nu'aym in *Ma'rifat Al-Sahabah* (1917/ 4; No: 4816), and for Isa bin Yunus bin Abi Ishaq Al-Sabi'i, from Hisham with it in *Fawa'id Ibn Akhi Mimi* (184; No: 372) - and this chain is according to Al-Bukhari's condition. As for the third person wording of it; i.e., 'He prayed before the death of...', Hammad bin Zaid narrated it from Hisham with it in *Akhbar Al-Qudah* by Waki' (2/ 400), except that he added: 'But he did not see the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him'. The report after this with slight difference, is suspended in *Sunan Al-Tirmidhi* (19/ 1; No: 13), and *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil* by Ibn Abi Hatim (91/ 6; No: 466), and *Tashifat Al-Muhaddithin* by Abu Ahmad =",

The men of the Hadith from Hisham onwards are men of the Sahih; Al-Haythami said this in *Al-Majma'* (10/ 7; No: 16254), and its chain is straight, but Ibn Abi Khaythama added following Yahya's narration: 'Yahya said: I did not find it with me and I fear it', which is a phrase creating ambiguity due to abbreviation, and its expansion occurred with Al-Khalili so its meaning became clear: 'Yahya said: I did not find it except with Hisham Al-Fardusi and I fear it'. If Yahya intended that he doubted his hearing from him or accused his memory of it or imagined it in his writing and did not find it - which is what his phrase at Ibn Abi Khaythama implies - then that is repelled by the follow-up of the trustworthy narrators for him, and their hearing it from Hisham as well. And if he intended Hisham's uniqueness in it as the pivot is on him - which is what his phrase at Al-Khalili implies - then there is no disparagement in it either; because it is the uniqueness of a trustworthy narrator, furthermore he is more trustworthy in Ibn Sirin than others, and Yahya Al-Qattan himself declares this, for Ibn Al-Madini quotes him saying: Hisham bin Hassan in Ibn Sirin is more beloved to me than Asim Al-Ahwal, and Khalid Al-Hadhdha' in Ibn Sirin (*Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 30/ 186; No: 6572).

Abu Sahl Al-Kufi, there is consensus on his weakness, no one mentioned him with anything other than weakness and abandonment.

Ibrahim bin Sa'id Al-Jawhari, from Yahya bin Ma'in, said: Al-Muthanna bin Al-Sabbah was a righteous man in himself, but in Hadith he was not that (Al-Du'afa by Al-Uqayli: 6/122; No: 6051).

He is: Abd al-A'la bin Amir Al-Kufi. I say: Weak, truthful in himself, they criticized his disturbance (Idtirab), but his weakness did not reach abandonment, so they tolerated him for consideration. Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi said: I told Sufyan a hadith of Abd al-A'la so he said: We used to think it was from a book. And Abd al-A'la used to narrate from Ibn Al-Hanafiyyah from Ali frequently, so Sufyan said: We used to think it was from a book, and he was weak in Hadith (Al-Tabaqat Al-Kabir: 8/453, No: 9413).

And in the printed Al-Du'afa: 'So he weakened him', and the generalization in this narration does not support the author's statement that Yahya used to narrate from him; for perhaps he only weakened him regarding his hadith from Ibn Al-Hanafiyyah specifically, not in all his hadith.

Al-Bukhari: He is weakened in Hadith. (Al-Du'afa via narration of Musabbih: 7 - b). And Abu Hatim said: 'I heard Abu Nu'aym Al-Fadl bin Dukain say: Shu'bah said to Laith bin Abi Sulaim: How did you ask Ata, Tawus, and Mujahid all in one sitting?. He said: Ask this hoof of your father!. Abu Muhammad said: Thus Shu'bah's asking Laith bin Abi Sulaim about the meeting of these three for him in one issue indicates; he was like one disapproving of him (Al-Jarh wal-Ta'dil: 1/151; No: 64). I say: And his answer is more convincing in Al-Kamil (9/7; No: 14366), and it resulted in Shu'bah avoiding him afterwards. And Ahmad bin Hanbal said: Disturbed in Hadith, but people narrated from him (Ilaluhu: 2/379; No: 2691); his hadith is not rejoiced at (Tartib Ilal Al-Tirmidhi: 293; No: 543). And he is from the men of Sahih Muslim by Ibn Manjuwayh (2/160; No: 1399). And Muslim's narration from him alone is not a modification removing the impugnment from him, for he only coupled him with Abu Ishaq Al-Shaibani, from Ash'ath bin Abi Al-Sha'tha' in the Book of Clothing and Adornment, Chapter on Prohibition of using gold and silver vessels for men and women... (3/1636; No: 2066), which is a single place. And this is from Muslim's methodology, may Allah have mercy on him, in that he follows the reports of the precise ones, with reports in whose chains occur some who are not described with memorization and precision... although they, even if they are below them as we described, the name of cover (satr), truthfulness, and engaging in knowledge encompasses them; like Ata bin Al-Sa'ib, Yazid bin Abi Ziyad, and Laith bin Abi Sulaim' (Sahihuhu: 1/5). So we conclude from what passed that Laith, in his combining disturbance with weakness due to his mixing up at the end, has exhausted the paths of escape, so he is not among those whose narration is good independently if he is alone, but if he is followed up from a sound face it is permissible; as Imam Muslim, may Allah have mercy on him, did.

It is supported by what Abu Ubaid Al-Ajurri heard from Abu Dawud (2/ 118; No: 1301): 'Yahya bin Sa'id abandoned the hadiths of Isma'il bin Muslim, who is called: Al-Makki.' Ibn Abi Khaythama said in his history (Volume 3: 1/ 247; No: 849): 'I heard Yahya bin Ma'in say: Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Qattan did not approve of many of the Meccans.'

Ibn Abi Hatim (6/ 247; No: 1365) transmitted the speech from Amr separately; he recounted the first part from the narration of Al-Hasanjani, and the second from the narration of Abu Al-Hasan Al-Tabari Al-Ghazi, although the latter narrated the author's last phrase by meaning without completing it fully, saying: 'Yahya used to narrate to us from Amr bin Ubaid'; and Abd al-Rahman followed it by citing the addition of his saying: 'then he abandoned him' sourced with Al-Ghazi's chain; so his action of cutting the report and repeating the chain in it gave the illusion that they are two separate texts in Al-Fallas's original that he combined, but the reality is contrary, for the two phrases are connected; witnessed by their connection in *Tarikh Baghdad* (84/ 14). The last phrase is in *Tarikh Al-Dhahabi* (3/ 941; No: 336). And it occurred in *Turar Ibn Shaqla* (163; No: 200): 'Yahya Al-Qattan narrated from him then abandoned him.' \n1.

Al-Fallas said: Isma'il bin Muslim Al-Makki, he held the view of Qadar (Free Will), and he is weak; he narrates from Al-Hasan and Qatadah false hadiths.

'And it occurred in the origins of *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir* (3/ 278; No: 952) and the manuscript narration of Musabbih bin Sa'id (4 - Z): \"Ibn Al-Mubarak\"; and this assumption is incorrect at all as it is incoherent, for Ibn Al-Mubarak was among the severest people in denouncing those who obfuscate, until the famous saying about him: He obfuscated his hadiths for the people, and Allah does not accept obfuscation' (*Ma'rifat Ulum Al-Hadith* by Al-Hakim: 164). If added to this that Mubarak bin Fadalah is famous for obfuscation as passed with us from Abu Dawud's words, and as is in *Ta'rif Ahl Al-Taqdis* (43, No: 93), we know that what occurred is purely an illusion, and it appeared corrected on the main road in *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil* by Ibn Abi Hatim (3/ 464; No: 2084); because he brought the report from which Al-Bukhari derived the preference, and its text is: 'Abd al-Rahman told us, Salih bin Ahmad bin Hanbal told us, Ali bin Al-Madini told us, he said: I said to Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Qattan: I do not see you narrating anything from Al-Rabi' bin Sabih?. He said: No, and Mubarak bin Fadalah is more beloved to me than him.' I say: Based on this, Al-Bukhari's phrase is an explanation of Al-Qattan's words, which is a valid direction. Add to that, much of what is obscure in *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir*, its explanation is often included in Ibn Abi Hatim's book. What cuts off the dispute is the occurrence of the speech by the author about Al-Rabi', immediately after the speech about Mubarak, indicating that comparison between them among the critics is a common practice. \n2. *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 3/ 465; No: 2084; *Al-Du'afa* (C): Folio 100 A. Mughlatay benefited from this text (4/ 342; No: 1550) and added: 'He is not strong'. Ibn Shaqla quoted it in passive voice without attribution in his margins on the Aya Sofya copy of Ibn Hibban's *Majruhin*: 97; No: 96. \n3. Abu Dawud (2/ 108; No: 1269): They claimed that the issues of Ata and Al-Hasan became confused for him.",

[2] Ibn Abi Hatim added 'Meaning: Hasan bin Dinar'; and likewise Ibn Hibban saying: 'He means Al-Hasan bin Dinar'; and this is not from Al-Fallas's words. _________ = is longer than what is in the original; and its context is: 'Al-Hasan bin Dinar is: Al-Hasan bin Wasil, Dinar was his stepfather, and he is a client of Banu Sulait, Sufyan Al-Thawri narrated from him and used his Kunya' saying: 'Abu Sa'id Al-Sulaiti told us'. \n1. Attribution to Banu Sulait (*Mukhtasar Al-Kamil* by Al-Maqrizi: 264; No: 446). Al-Bukhari quoted Sufyan's benefit, and established the narrator's abandonment by Yahya and Ibn Mahdi in the two histories (2/ 292; No: 1513, 3/ 593; No: 908). Al-Fallas said: 'I heard Abu Asim say: I heard Hammad bin Zaid narrate from him with two hadiths; I said to him: You narrate from this one?!. He said: Do you see him lying in two hadiths?!'. (*Al-Kamil*: 3/ 451; No: 445). Amr bin Ali also said: 'I heard Abu Dawud [Al-Tayalisi] say: We were with Shu'bah, so Al-Hasan bin Dinar came, so Shu'bah said: O Abu Sa'id, here, so he sat, and said: Humaid bin Hilal told us, from Mujahid, he said: I heard Umar bin Al-Khattab say. He said: So Shu'bah started saying: Mujahid heard Umar!.

Amr bin Ali said: 'Al-Hasan bin Dinar, Abu Dawud narrated from him in Isfahan, and started saying: Al-Hasan bin Wasil told us; and in my view he is not among the people of lies, but he was not a Hafiz'. Some of what passed is present in *Al-Asami wa Al-Kuna* by Abu Ahmad Al-Hakim (The Manuscript Section): 47. Al-Bukhari said: 'Waki' and Ibn Al-Mubarak abandoned him (*Du'afauhu*, narration of Musabbih: 3 - F). Abu Dawud Al-Sijistani said about him (1/ 390; No: 746): 'He is nothing' (2/ 33; No: 1024): 'Not trustworthy'. I say: It is gathered from their sayings that Abu Asim did not see narrating from him, and that Hammad bin Zaid only narrated two hadiths from him, deeming it unlikely he would lie in both, so he did not narrate much from him. Waki' and Ibn Al-Mubarak abandoned him, and Shu'bah denied some of his hadith and left him, and his two students Yahya Al-Qattan and Ibn Mahdi abandoned him, and Al-Tayalisi denied lying from him but accused him of bad memory, and Abu Dawud Al-Sijistani declared him weak: so he is weak inevitably.",

I say: Perhaps he meant his saying in Al-Gharib (4/288): Yahya bin Sa'id narrated to me, from Sharik, from Ziyad bin Ilaqah from Al-Maghrur, from Umar who said: Whoever wishes let him flee in the first mobilization, except Banu Asad bin Khuzaimah.'

This is close to Ahmad's answer to Abu Dawud (311; No: 405) when he asked him: 'Is Isra'il more beloved to you or Sharik?' He said: Isra'il, when he narrates from his book, does not leave anything out, and he memorizes from his book, except [I do not rely] on his hadith [from memory?]. Sharik has inconsistency in his hadith, he narrates from Mughirah the hadiths of Ubaidah.'

    "foot_note": "1. = Al-Awsat (3/639; No: 985): 'Abu Dawud said: Qais was only compromised because of his son, and his son used to take people's hadiths and insert them into the gaps of Qais's book, and the Sheikh did not know that.' Ibn Abi Hatim did not cite criticism against him, but rather brought reports containing Shu'bah bin Al-Hajjaj's praise of him for diligence in seeking knowledge. See: Al-Jarh wal-Ta'dil: 1/150; No: 63. In Tarikh Baghdad (14/469), Shu'bah said: 'Qais discussed with me the hadith of Abu Hasin, and I wished the house would fall on me and him until we died, due to the abundance of strange things (Gharib) he presented to me.' I say: Shu'bah's admiration of him is coupled with his defect, which is his narrating strange things, and narrating strange things is not what testifies to trustworthiness, and whatever the case, even if it is permissible in discussion, it is avoided in narration. Above what passed, judgment is usually given to Yahya's verdict on a narrator if he shared knowledge of him with his teacher Shu'bah, over what Shu'bah held independently, for his domain was narration, and there is no entry then for Yahya's opinion. Evidence for what we just said is that Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi said: They differed one day in front of Shu'bah, so they said: Appoint a judge between us and you, he said: I am satisfied with the cross-eyed one (Al-Ahwal) - meaning: Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Qattan - so we did not leave until Yahya came; so they sought his judgment, and he ruled against Shu'bah, so Shu'bah said: And who can withstand your criticism, O Ahwal? (Tarikh Baghdad: 16/205; No: 7413). Despite this, he knew his opinion on Qais and rebuked him for it saying: 'O Ahwal, you mention Qais Al-Asadi?!' as if disapproving of him. (Dhikr man Ikhtalafa al-Ulama...: 81; No: 37). It seems this was not Shu'bah's opinion alone, for Al-Fallas narrated reports from him with this meaning and from Abu Al-Walid Al-Tayalisi and Abu Dawud as well, saying: 'I heard Abu Dawud say: I heard Shu'bah say: How strange for this Ahwal, he does not approve of Qais bin Al-Rabi' - meaning: Yahya bin Sa'id Al-Qattan'. And he said: I said to Abu Al-Walid: You praise Qais bin Al-Rabi' a lot? He said: Because he - by Allah - used to fear Allah. Or something like this; I doubt the oath'. And he said: 'When Yazid bin Harun came to Basra and narrated to us from Qais, I said: Narrate to us from someone else, so it reached Abu Dawud, and he got angry with me until I apologized to him. And I said to him: I write Qais from you, and I write from Yazid the senior Sheikhs (Masa'il Harb bin Ismail Al-Kirmani; Marriage to end of book): (3/1333-1334; No: 2402, 2403, 2404). In Tarikh Baghdad (14/469): 'Affan said: I said to Yahya bin Sa'id: Did you hear Sufyan say anything about him regarding a mistake, or speak about him with anything? He said: No. I said to Yahya: Do you accuse him of lying? He said: No. Affan said: So he brought no proof regarding him'. I say: As for Sufyan, he mentioned him based on what he knew of his state, and perhaps what indicated the weakness that befell him later did not reach him yet, whether by confusion or otherwise, which escaped Shu'bah and Sufyan, and supporting this is that Ibn Mahdi followed them =",

    "foot_note": "1. = in having a good opinion of Qais so he narrated from him, then when he tested his hadith he retracted from that, so he gained knowledge by accompanying him that they did not get, while affirming that the status of Shu'bah and Sufyan is higher and more significant. None of the critics said that a critic's judgment on a narrator during his life is eternal and irreversible, such that it is conceded to Shu'bah forever. As for Yahya negating lying from him, it is not a modification (Ta'dil) nor does it necessitate it, for the cause of abandoning a narrator is not always lying, but includes frequent delusion, apparent confusion, bad memory, loss of original books... And Yahya Al-Qattan's silence on bringing proof for abandoning him is not proof of its absence, nor evidence of his hand being empty of what testifies to it, but Affan sensed it from what preceded, and in my opinion if he had confronted him with a question about the cause he would have cited it; so there is no proof in this report at all to negate the existence of a cause for criticism by Yahya, and it is apparent that he tested Qais's hadith and flaws appeared to him in it which appeared to Ibn Mahdi later leading him to retract his agreement, supported by the saying of the Sheikh of the Art Ali bin Al-Madini: 'Only a son of his destroyed him, he reversed things in his hadith, and Abd al-Rahman bin Mahdi narrated from him for a time then abandoned him' (Tarikh Baghdad: 469/14). Ibn Numair added: 'He had a son who was his bane, the Hadith scholars looked into his books and rejected his hadith, and suspected that his son had changed them' (Al-Majruhin: 78/1). Furthermore, Affan later realized what he denied on Yahya, so it was not appropriate to cite his earlier speech without the later one, for he said: 'I used to hear people mentioning Qais, and I did not know what his defect was, so when we came to Kufa we went to him, sat with him, and his son started prompting him saying to him: Husain, so he says: Husain, then another man says: And Mughirah, so he says: And Mughirah, another says: And Al-Shaibani, so he says: And Al-Shaibani (Al-Majruhin: 219/2). In his speech is a great benefit, which is that the talk about Qais was widespread, not in a narrow circle. Ibn Hibban said: I have tested the reports of Qais bin Al-Rabi' from the narration of the early and later scholars and tracked them, so I saw him truthful and trustworthy when he was young, but when he grew old his memory worsened and he was tested with a bad son, who used to insert hadith upon him and he would answer him trusting his son, so when rejected reports (Manakir) overwhelmed his authentic hadith and could not be distinguished, he deserved to be avoided in argumentation. So whoever praised him among our Imams and encouraged [narrating from] him, that was from them because they looked at the upright things he narrated from his hearing. And whoever weakened him among them, that was because they knew of the rejected reports in his hadith that his son and others inserted upon him' (Al-Majruhin: 2/219).",

Abu Dawud said it (1/223; No: 248) about Ibn Mahdi alone - without Yahya.. Ibn Zanjawaih said in his Tabaqat (70; my verification): 'Abu Al-Yaqzan: Uthman bin Umair Al-Bajali'. See: Tahdhib al-Kamal: 19/469-472; No: 3851; Ikmal Tahdhib al-Kamal: 9/177-179; No: 3645. \n3. Al-Kamil: 2/69; but 'Yaktubu' (writes) occurred in it; perhaps a misspelling. See: The following comment. \n4. Al-Fallas said in his Tarikh (334): Abu Salih, client of Umm Hani, his name is Badhan, and they said: Badham'. Al-Bukhari said in his weak narrators from narration of Musabbih bin Sa'id: 2 - (b): 'Muhammad bin Humaid said: From Hakim bin Bashir, from Amr bin Qais Al-Mula'i, he said: Mujahid used to forbid the Tafsir of Abu Salih'. And it occurred in Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir (2/144; Bio: 1988): 'Hakam bin Bashir', and perhaps it is correct, due to the support of copies for it, and the singularity of Musabbih's copy. Al-Saji said in the weak narrators from the Meccans: 'Abu Salih from whom Ismail bin Abi Khalid narrated, his name is Badhan, client of Umm Hani, and he is the one from whom Al-Kalbi, Al-Suddi, Mansur, Sayyar, Ismail bin Salim, Abd al-Aziz bin Rufai', Abu Makin, Firas, Muhammad bin Juhadah, Simak bin Harb, and Husain narrated. And Ali bin Al-Madini said: I heard Yahya bin Sa'id say: I have not seen any of our companions abandon Abu Salih client of Umm Hani nor have we heard anyone say anything against him, and neither Shu'bah nor Za'idah nor Abdullah bin Uthman abandoned him'.

Perhaps the report is unique to the book. Among the indications of misspelling is that Al-Fallas's report regarding Yahya's specific stance on Isa has passed, and it is quoted from him in the aforementioned books, unlike his speech about the stance of the two Sheikhs regarding him here, for it is not in any of them, yes... you find it exactly but about Salim, and Allah knows best.

It appears Yahya had a bad opinion of him, for Al-Fallas said (Tarikh al-Islam: 4/534; No: 419): 'Yahya did not approve of his book nor his memory, and did not narrate from him.' It seems the generalization that Yahya did not narrate from him needs exception, for he did not narrate from him in audition circles, but he used to bring his hadith in discussion or debate circles for consideration or otherwise; as indicated by Ahmad's saying in Al-Jawabāt (335-336; No: 491): 'Yahya used to narrate from Aban Al-Attar, and not narrate from Hammam, then - they claimed - Mu'adh bin Hisham arrived, and narrated hadiths in which he agreed with Hammam.

So the hearing of Affan, Hibban, and Bahz is better than the hearing of Abd al-Rahman; because he used to narrate to them - meaning: to Abd al-Rahman; i.e., in their days - from memory.' It appears that Ibn Mahdi had a book containing [narrations] from Affan, and he had stripped its benefits and selected them in his mind, so Ali bin Al-Madini asked him for it and said: 'Show it to me so I can write something from it. He said: No, but let me dictate to you what I see you will benefit from, so when I finish I will give it to you to look at. He said: So he dictated to me hadiths from it that I benefited from, then he gave me the book so I looked into it and did not benefit anything from it' (Tarikh Al-Muqaddami: 202-203; No: 1001).

Al-Bukhari said in his *Du'afa* (Narration of Musabbih: 2. Z): 'Ibn Uyainah used to signal a defect in him'.

The origin of the Hadith without the addition is in *Sahih Muslim* (4/ 138; No: 3743) with a fuller context. The author's statement is witnessed by Ibn Al-Junayd's question to Yahya bin Ma'in: Did Ibn Jurayj hear from Mujahid? He said: A letter or two in recitation; he did not hear other than that. Al-Bardiji and others said likewise (*Tuhfat Al-Tahsil*: 212). The truth is that Ibn Jurayj did not hear anything from Ibn Shihab, rather he presented (Arad) to him, as Ibn Al-Madini said in *Al-Ma'rifah wa Al-Tarikh* by Al-Fasawi (2/ 139), but Al-Zuhri is of the doctrine of equating hearing and presentation as he said: 'Presentation of the book and Hadith are equal' (*Al-Kifayah*: 265); so Al-Qattan's statement is not absolute then in limiting what Ibn Jurayj heard from Al-Zuhri. This is supported by what occurred in *Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir* by Ibn Abi Khaythama (Volume Three: 1/ 256; No: 882): Ali claimed: Yahya said: Sufyan bin Habib told me: That Ibn Jurayj validated this hadith from Al-Zuhri: 'That people from the Jews, fought with the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him'.

The author was silent about Al-Qattan's action, and he had 'abandoned Usamah at the end'; as stated by Ahmad in his answers: 218; No: 191. Al-Saji said: 'Yahya bin Ma'in narrated from Usamah bin Zaid then abandoned him at the end'. (*Turar Ibn Shaqla* on the Aya Sofya copy of *Al-Majruhin* by Ibn Hibban: 25; No: 58). \n2.

I say: So either he meant that Usamah, despite their sharing in weakness, is the best of them, or he might have intended Al-Laythi - not their brother - for distinction -, and this is supported by his saying heard by Ibn Abi Khaythama: 'Abd al-Rahman bin Zaid bin Aslam, Abdullah bin Zaid bin Aslam, and Usamah bin Zaid bin Aslam, the sons of Zaid bin Aslam, all three are weak in Hadith, their hadith is nothing' (*Al-Tarikh Al-Kabir*: Volume Three: 2/ 339; No: 3254). \n3. *Al-Du'afa* by Al-Uqayli (C): Folio 130 A; to his saying: 'divorce of the sick'; *Al-Kamil*: 3/ 445; to 'Al-Qubur', and from 'I heard Abd al-Samad', to the end of the report. *Tarikh Al-Islam*: 4/ 70; No: 87; from his saying: he narrated something objectionable to 'Al-Qubur'; and from 'And he narrated more objectionable' to 'the sick'.

I commented on it there: And the author's naming of Sahl's father as 'Zurbi', is something I have not found in the books of Rijal despite intense search, so if I haven't missed it, it is among the additions of the book'.

    "foot_note": "1. Perhaps Ibn Mahdi's defense of them - contrary to Ibn Ma'in, and despite the necessitating critical reason - is due to the authenticity of their lineage among Arabs and their manners with him and his companion Al-Qattan even if they were clients (Mawali) - for it was said of the first: he is a client of Azd, and of the second: he is a client of Tamim - evidenced by Yahya bin Sa'id's stipulation of this cause in his saying (*Tarikh Baghdad*: 15/ 168): 'I sought Hadith with two men from the Arabs: Khalid bin Al-Harith bin Salim Al-Hujaymi, and Mu'adh bin Mu'adh Al-Anbari, and I am a client of Quraish to Taim, and by Allah they never beat me to a narrator and wrote something until I arrived'. And it has a witness from the saying of Ya'qub bin Sufyan (*Ikmal Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 1/ 296; No: 296), about Ibn Muhajir: 'He has honor and nobility, and in his hadith is softness'. Furthermore, Ibn Mahdi narrated from Sufyan from Ibn Muhajir. See: An example from him in *Tarikh Ibn Abi Khaythama*: Volume Three: 1/ 196; No: 499; 3/ 170; No: 4318. I have not found anyone who addressed this report with an explanation that satisfies me; so perhaps it is correct, God willing. \n2. *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 9/ 244; No: 1024; abbreviated, from his saying: 'So Abd al-Rahman said, to Sufyan from him'; *Al-Kamil*: 7/ 178; except that he returned and identified the intended man. \n3. By this report, an error in transmission at Al-Uqayli in his weak narrators (C: Folio 410 B) is known, leading to the opposite of the case; for Abu Ja'far when he needed to distribute the text between two places, was confused in attributing the second half, so instead of attributing the speech to Yahya bin Ma'in, who is intended above by 'the man' as explicitly stated, he attributed it to Yahya bin Sa'id, and explicitly named him saying: 'Ibn Sa'id', even though the rest of the speech rejects it without effort, for how can Al-Qattan speak [critically] of a narrator then narrate from him?, and the 'Fa' of comment in the speech brought after, indicates Ibn Mahdi's intention to object, and this rarely happens from him with Al-Qattan. The intended phrase of Al-Uqayli: 'Amr bin Ali, said: I heard Yahya bin Sa'id mention Yunus bin Abi Ishaq one day and speak about him; so Abd al-Rahman said: There was no harm in him; Abu Hafs says it...'. The transmission ends with slight difference in wording to the text's saying: 'from Sufyan from him'. \n4. He is: Yahya bin Ma'in. \n5. Yunus bin Abi Ishaq, and his name is Amr bin Abdullah Al-Hamdani Al-Sabi'i, Abu Isra'il Al-Kufi. \n6.

Yahya bin Ma'in and the two Razis declared him trustworthy (*Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 21/ 6; No: 108). If there was speech against him by a speaker, Abu Zur'ah would not have criticized Abdullah bin Salamah Al-Aftas for speaking against him and Yahya Al-Qattan, making that one of his criticisms against him (*Su'alat Al-Bardha'i*: 79; No: 17). Perhaps this is one of the foundations of Ibn Al-Qattan Al-Fasi's statement in *Bayan Al-Wahm wa Al-Iham* (328/ 5): 'Trustworthy, no defect was found against him'. Al-Nasa'i said: There is no harm in him (*Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 18/ 454; No: 3585). Ibn Abd al-Barr: 'They agreed, there is no disagreement among them regarding Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad that he is a firm trustworthy narrator; Mughlatay quoted it (364/ 8; No: 3390), and said shortly after: This and its like scratches Abu Umar's saying: \"They agreed\", so it should be looked into'. I say: If we remove from the biography Al-Uqayli's statement in which he erred, and Al-Bazzar's statement which was misspelled from him - as will come - Ala' al-Din's critique would have no face, and Allah knows best. Al-Hakim: They both relied on him - meaning: the two Sheikhs - heavily, and he, may Allah have mercy on him, is worthy of being relied upon (*Al-Madkhal*: 182/ 4). I say: Perhaps in Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad's nature, there was something that kept him away from fame and contributed to lack of knowledge about him, for he was Yazid bin Zurai's companion with Yunus, without his name being known, so when he heard his narration from Yunus later he would deny it and label him a liar, then when he met him on some road he recognized him, Ahmad said: I heard Affan, he said: They used to mention Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad to Yazid bin Zurai' and he would say: Who is this liar who narrates from Yunus?; I do not know him. He said: Then he met him one day on some road, and it was said to him: This is Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad. He said: This was our companion with Yunus. So they said: This is Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad (*Al-Ilal wa Ma'rifat Al-Rijal*: 1/ 355; No: 675). It is strange how the transmitters reported Al-Fallas's words about his Tadlis (obfuscation), and did not report Ibn Mahdi's words in 'accepting him'. As for what Al-Uqayli reported in the biography of Abu Bishr Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad Al-Abdi, from Uthman bin Sa'id, he said: I asked Yahya about Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad, so he said: He is nothing (*Al-Du'afa*: 531/ 3; No: 3523), it contradicts what preceded from Yahya regarding his authentication, so what is here is an error in transmission necessitated by misspelling, and illusion was possible in it, for the intended by Yahya in weakening is Abd al-Wahid bin Zaid the Basran Preacher, and this one is weak without disagreement, and in his entry in Ibn Ma'in's history, the above report occurred to Uthman bin Sa'id Al-Darimi (147; No: 506), and Ibn Shahin reported it from him correctly in *Tarikh Asma Al-Du'afa wa Al-Kadhdhabin* (132; No: 413). So it passed unnoticed by Al-Uqayli then, and Al-Dhahabi followed him in *Al-Mizan* (672/ 2; No: 5287) and *Al-Siyar* (8/ 9), and *Al-Tarikh* (4/ 686; No: 188) and *Diwan Al-Du'afa* =",

Confusion between the two men also occurred to Mughlatay, for he cited in the biography of Ibn Ziyad - with Alif after Ya - Al-Bazzar's saying: He was a worshiper, and I reckon he used to hold the view of Qadar, despite his intense worship, and he is not strong. I say: His words occur in his *Musnad* (106/ 1; No: 44), and it is driven regarding Abd al-Wahid bin Zaid, so it is transferred from its place there to the drawing of Abd al-Wahid bin Zaid in *Al-Iktifa fi Tanqih Kitab Al-Du'afa* (2/ 442; No: 471); because Ala' al-Din did not write a biography for him in his *Ikmal*, according to his condition. I say: What prompted me to verify these places, is that the gap between Ibn Ma'in's judgment and the rest of the critics is usually not wide-ranging, but rather close, so due to the severity of the contrast I examined it, and lo, the matter involves a hidden misspelling. Due to the severity of confusion between Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad and Abd al-Wahid bin Zaid, Al-Khatib created a chapter for them in *Tali Talkhis Al-Mutashabih* (359/ 2; No: 323 - 324). See: *Ma'rifat Al-Thiqat*: 22/ 107; No: 1143; *Ikmal Tahdhib Al-Kamal*: 363/ 8; No: 3390; *Thiqat Ibn Hibban*: 123/ 7; No 9283; *Su'alat Al-Sulami*: 200; No: 190; *Al-Iktifa* by Mughlatay: 441/ 2; No: 470; *Al-Jarh wa Al-Ta'dil*: 21/ 6; No: 108; *Al-Kamil*: 375/ 8; No: 13346. \n1. This report of Ibn Mahdi implies the good condition of Abd al-Wahid, and Abu Dawud's report - coming after one report - removes him from that condition by Tadlis (obfuscation), indeed Yahya denies his knowledge of Al-A'mash's hadith entirely, in his saying: 'I never saw Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad seek hadith at all, neither in Basra, nor in Kufa. And we used to sit at his door on Friday after prayer, so we would discuss Al-A'mash's hadith, and he does not know a letter of it (*Du'afa Al-Uqayli*: 531/ 3; No: 3521; *Al-Kamil*: 375/ 8; No: 13346), although this story does not yield Yahya's weakening, that is why Mughlatay denied Ibn Al-Jawzi's understanding from it saying: Yahya weakened him (*Al-Iktifa*: 441/ 2). However, Abd al-Wahid's knowledge - even if partial - of Al-A'mash's hadith cannot be denied, for Imam Ahmad used his corroboration (Mutaba'ah) to correct Masruq's narration from Al-Mughirah, so if he was devoid of knowledge entirely as implied by Yahya's story, Ibn Hanbal would not have considered him in corroboration, =",

And 'Yaqulu' (Say) is advanced in it after 'Abd al-Rahman'. _________ = And that is apparent from his saying: 'I heard Yahya bin Sa'id and the hadith of Al-A'mash, from Muslim, from Masruq, from Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah was mentioned in his presence. So Yahya said: Masruq, from Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah?! - twice or thrice - so Yahya denied it most strongly. Abdullah bin Ahmad said: I said to my father: Who corroborated him?. He said: More than one; I think among them is Abd al-Wahid bin Ziyad ... (*Al-Ilal wa Ma'rifat Al-Rijal*: 122/ 3; No: 4520). Combining these stances is possible if we count a lapse of time between them, for each of them described the reality of the narrator's matter at his time, so Al-Qattan's words when discussing Al-A'mash's hadith with Abd al-Wahid are carried on his early days in narration, and Abu Dawud's words about his Tadlis are carried on when his condition improved in it and he ascended in knowledge and trustworthiness, and Ibn Mahdi's stance is carried on when he deserved to be 'among those who increase in good', so he transforms from the weak to the trustworthy, and in it is invalidation of Yahya's stance. And in the phrase above, there is a clear stipulation of the reason for the critical retraction, for he expressed it in the present tense form indicating his increase in good and persistence on it. And it is not said: that this phrase is not a text in the place of dispute; because it is a value judgment unrelated to narration; because we say: in it is an indication to the hypothetical recipient of the sender's knowledge of the judgments of critics preceding him, that's why he didn't say: 'Indeed there is good in him', nor 'there was good in him', because of what is in them of refraining from declaration, suitable for maintaining what was as it was - i.e., in weakness - so it doesn't indicate an improvement in condition, so his choice of the phrase then is intended as produced by the styles of Arabic. It remains that Ibn Mahdi's phrase about Ibn Ziyad might be carried - contrary to what passed - on righteousness and worship. \n1. *Siyar A'lam Al-Nubala*: 369/ 8; No: 108; *Tarikh Al-Islam*: 4/ 915; No: 220; except that Al-Dhahabi specified the duration in both books saying: 'Since thirty years like him'.

The investigator - may he be blessed - estimated that there is an omission in the text, and whatever the case; its meaning is affirming hearing for Al-A'mash from Mujahid, but Yahya's induction of what he narrated from him of hadiths, showed that four or five - in Al-Duri's narration (3/ 327; No: 1570) - are what he truly heard, as for the rest which are many, they are not so, so his saying: 'Everything he narrates ...', is a predominant judgment not absolute; and then the text appears straight with no crookedness or curvature God willing. See: Our comment on the author's previous quote from Yahya saying: 'I wrote from Al-A'mash hadiths from Mujahid all pasted (Mulazzaqah) he did not hear them'.
